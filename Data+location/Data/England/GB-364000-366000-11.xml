		<title>11      Local Transport</title>
		<content>    We did a transport survey to find  
 out how many vehicles went past       
  our school which is on the{A5018 from
{Winsford to Northwich.}               
    As the vehicles were going past we 
 ticked them off on a graph.We were    
 looking for various types of          
 transport.                            
    We did a morning survey,a midday   
 survey and an afternoon survey to see 
 which was the busiest time.           
    We found that there was no         
 significant difference between the    
 times.In each case cars passed most   
 frequently.
