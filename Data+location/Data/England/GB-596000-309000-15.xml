		<title>15TRADE: KENNELS IN WESTFIELD</title>
		<content> Foxley Boarding Kennels is on the     
 outskirts of Westfield and they can   
 take up to 24 dogs and 32 cats at one 
 time. The busiest time for the kennels
 and cattery is in the summer (from    
 July to September). They keep their   
 animals in a big garden in individual 
 kennels. The cats and dogs are kept   
 separate to each other. They change   
 the animals' bedding every other day  
 and they walk them twice a day. The   
 kennels have been there for 4 years   
 but the owners now have only been     
 there for 6 months.                   
 There are no other employees who work 
 at the kennels except their daughter  
 and their son who sometimes lend a    
 hand. Other than that they do         
 everything themselves. All rates are  
 daily. If a pet is removed before noon
 then no charge for that day will be   
 made.                                 </content>
