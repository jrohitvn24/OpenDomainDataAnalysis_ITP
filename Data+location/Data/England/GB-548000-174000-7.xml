		<content> The accent is very much on leisure    
 gear for both sexes, and features     
 lightweight, light coloured           
 comfortable clothing.  For girls,     
 "flower-power" or floral blouses which
 tie at the waist are extremely        
 popular.  Teamed with floral patterned
 trousers, fall-down socks and soft    
 ankle boots or low heeled shoes.  The 
 fashionable young lady of 1985        
 completes her outfit by wearing       
 butterfly clips in her hair, purple   
 eye shadow and dark lipstick.         
 Earrings are still more popular with  
 girls and range from novelty types to 
 as many as seven in one ear!  Boys too
 have a wide choice in fashion.        
 Jogging or track suits are popular, as
 are sweat shirts, T-shirts, "baggies",
 "cords" or stone-washed jeans.  White 
 ankle socks and soft leather boots or 
 trainers complete the outfit.         </content>
