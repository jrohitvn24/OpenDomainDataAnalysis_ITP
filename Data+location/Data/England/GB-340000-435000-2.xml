		<title>02ECOLOGY OF GREENHALGH AREA</title>
		<content> The land in this block is mostly heavy
 loam overlying boulder clay and with  
 some moss land where there are numbers
 of small springs.  It is low lying,   
 rising to only 23 metres.  There are  
 small areas of mostly deciduous woods 
 with sycamore, ash, beech, birch and  
 elm.  Some appear to be dying from    
 age, neglect and Dutch Elm disease.   
 The hedgerows are mainly hawthorn     
 with elderberry, alder, hazel, wild   
 roses, honeysuckle, bramble,          
 blackthorn and crab apples in places. 
 The weather is temperate with         
 occasional extremes.  These have      
 recently been experienced.  1984 had a
 dry hot summer with drought occurring.
 1985 had a dry cold spring with a     
 great deal of east wind followed by a 
 wetter than usual summer.  The average
 rainfall for the Fylde, of which this 
 block is a part, is about 44 inches.  </content>
