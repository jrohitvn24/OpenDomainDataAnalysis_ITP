		<title>18RESIDENTS' COMMENTS ON SHOPS</title>
		<content> Order of importance following a survey
 1 Bishops Waltham is a{well stocked}  
   town which is{attractive}and is very
  {friendly.}                          
 2 The town needs a{larger supermarket}
   but many people were concerned that 
   it should not detract from the{     
{  village}character.                  
 3{Parking fees}recently introduced are
   bad and cause danger by more parking
   in the High Street. A time limit on 
   parking, perhaps a disc system,might
   be more advantageous.               
 4 The two main reasons for{out-of-town
   bulk buying are: it is cheaper and  
   there are no parking fees at many   
   supermarkets.                       
 5 Some parents think we need a toy    
   shop, a fabric shop, a hardware     
   shop, a deep-freeze centre and a    
   take-away food centre.
