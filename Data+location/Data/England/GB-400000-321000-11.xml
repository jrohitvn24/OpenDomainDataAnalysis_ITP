The Ring was formerly  a ring of       
cottages built for the land workers of 
Shugborough Hall. They were built in   
the form of an octagon with a communal 
well, wash house, bake house and fuel  
store in the middle. There was an      
archway into the ring. It is thought   
that it was built as an experiment in  
rehousing and was said to be unique.   
The Ring was built to rehouse the      
villagers of Shugborough Village when  
Thomas Anson landscaped Shugborough    
Park. The cottages formed just one     
building. The cottages were pulled down
about 20 years ago and new   houses    
were built. They are all   bungalows,  
but some of them have rooms  in the    
loft. The Jubilee playing   fields are 
behind the ring. The   playing field   
was opened in the Queens   Silver      
Jubilee (1977).                        </content>
