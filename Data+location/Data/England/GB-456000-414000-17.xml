		<title>17THE BEST KEPT VILLAGE</title>
		<content> In South Yorkshire there is a         
{competition}every three years for the 
 best kept village.{Fenwick}has entered
 this competiton ever since it started 
 in 1959. A week before this takes     
 place people go around Fenwick and    
 pick up rubbish and litter. Most      
 people hide their dustbins to make it 
 look cleaner. They hang flowers in    
 baskets and mow their lawns. They were
 runners-up in 1976 and{winners}in     
 1982. The winners receive a seat which
 remains in the village for all time   
 and trees are planted in the village. 
 The cleanest village is judged by a   
 committee of people from the area.    
 This means{Fenwick}is one of the      
 cleanest villages in South Yorkshire.
