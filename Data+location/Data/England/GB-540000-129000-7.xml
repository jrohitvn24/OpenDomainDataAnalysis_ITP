		<content> Public events in the village are cent-
 red on the Village Hall. In mid-      
 December there is the Christmas Tree  
 Lighting, with carol singing, perfor- 
 mances by children's groups and a col-
 lection for a local charity. The Hall 
 Management Committee also organises   
 two supper dances each year; and a    
 whist drive each month from October to
 April. Every other year it holds a    
 fund-raising Fete. The organisations  
 that use the Hall are invited to      
 contribute by arranging stalls, compe-
 titions etc., with a proportion of the
 profits going to the Hall.            
 The gardens of Birch Grove House are  
 opened to the public two Sundays      
 during spring (by the Macmillan family
 see BIOGRAPHY).
