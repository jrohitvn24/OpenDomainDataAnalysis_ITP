		<content>    Houses in this area are in several 
 small villages to the west and south  
 of this block.                        
    There are only 15 council houses   
 and several of these are being bought 
 by the occupier now.                  
    Any new housing is either          
 individual or in very small groups of 
 5 or 6.                               
    Gardens are generally large        
 and only one row of thatched terraced 
 cottages in Prixford,which have no    
 garages have cobbled out their front  
 area to provide parking spaces for    
 their cars.                           
     Many houses are converted         
 from farm buildings and a house name  
 like "The Granary" or "The Tythe Barn"
 can be seen in this area.Houses are   
 not numbered in this area except for  
 the council houses,all have individual
 names given to them by the occupier.  </content>
