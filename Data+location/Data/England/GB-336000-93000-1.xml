		<content> This is a designated Area of          
 Outstanding Natural Beauty on the West
 Dorset Heritage Coast.                
 The delightful rolling hills, many    
 topped by attractive coppices, display
 a pleasing patchwork of hedged fields.
 this is farming country.  The rich    
 pasture land supports fifteen small   
 farms, mainly dairy and sheep but with
 a little arable, around the ancient   
 hamlets of Wootton Fitzpaie,Catherston
 Leweston and Whitchurch Canonicorum.  
 Never a railway here, the main traffic
 artery is the A35 Trunk Road leading  
 through to West country.              
 The river Char meanders idly through  
 this landscape to reach the sea at    
 Charmouth with its spectacular lias   
 and greensand cliffs where Jurassic   
 fossils abound. Charmouth is a        
 'conservation Area' village, with     
 Georgian and Regency buildings        </content>
