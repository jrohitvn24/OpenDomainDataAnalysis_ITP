 In 1985 a new Clubhouse was opened by 
 Chris Tavare, the Kent and England    
 Cricketer. It was built to replace the
 original one that was destroyed by    
 fire the previous year. This pavilion,
 which has changing rooms, a licenced  
 bar and Club facilites, was the result
 of much hard work by the Club members,
 and also houses a fine set of old     
 photographs of Headcorn Cricket teams 
 dating back to 1909.
