		<title>06 Future Housing For Rushden</title>
		<content>  If any development is to take place  
the builders must have planning        
permission. In 1980 owners of land at  
Manor Farm had to outline plans and    
fill in an application form.           
  The site covers 35.6 acres on the    
Manor Farm estate and will include 300 
dwellings. They were given planning    
permission on 21st June, 1983. It took 
2 years to sort out details. When      
permission was given they filled in 3.5
pages of conditions.                   
  There were 22 conditions altogether. 
For 17 houses there were just a few    
conditions. Probably owners would get  
full permission soon to start building.
  Houses are to be developed in six    
phases. Mostly 3-4 bedroom and terraced
houses. There will be over 3 acres of  
houses in the 1st stage. They also have
to sort out sewage and drainage.
