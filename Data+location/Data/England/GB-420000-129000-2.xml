		<content>  Here are some of the ball games we   
 play, catch, {bally,}rugby, football,{
{doggy, queenie,}tennis and netball.   
 Some sports games are skipping,       
 hopscotch, races, handstands,{polo,}  
 play fights and horses. Hiding games  
 we play are hide and seek, spying,    
 40-40, sardines and kick the can. Some
 of the chasing games we play are      
 chase, kiss-chase, cops and robbers,  
 army, Jack may we cross the water,    
 British bulldog,{Mrs. Piggy,}poison,  
 buzz and{Crocodile.}                  
 Now we will explain all the           
 highlighted games:to play bally one   
 person has the ball and has to chase  
 the other people. When they think they
 can hit someone with the ball, they   
 throw it. If it hits them they are    
 "up". When we play doggy we use a     
 football. We line up opposite a wall  
 and kick the ball against the wall in </content>
