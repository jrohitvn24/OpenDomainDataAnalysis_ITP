		<title>07VILLAGE HALL, UFFCULME</title>
		<content> The{Village Hall}was built originally 
 as a Church School. It was sold by the
 Church to a Village Committe in 1975. 
 Alterations were made between 1978 and
 1980 to improve the facilities.       
    It now has a main hall and stage   
 with a number of different stage      
 lights. These are used mainly by UADS 
{( Uffculme Ameatuer Dramatic Society) 
 and{Uffculme Primary School}for stage 
 productions. Added on to this ,the    
 original building, are dressing rooms 
 at the rear, a store room at the side 
 and a kitchen and coffee bar          
 overlooking the lawns and pond to the 
 south. The Playgroup, UADS and the    
 Over-60's all have regular bookings   
 here and many other{Village Events}and
{Fetes etc.}are held here annually.    
 Income just about pays for day to day 
 running costs. Lack of space will     
 prevents further expansion in size.   </content>
