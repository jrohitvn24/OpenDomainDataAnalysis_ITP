<title>22Changes in Mansfield Woodhouse: Rural</title>
<content>Pleasley Vale has changed as the mill buildings are now mostly disused apart from some small manufacturing units. The area has been made accessible with footpaths and walks for the local community. In Mansfield Woodhouse, several new housing estates have been built on former farmland, particularly along Peafield Lane and the new Peafield Park has also been created on former waste land.
