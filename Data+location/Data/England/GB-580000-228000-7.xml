		<content> The hospital in Halstead is a little  
 way along Hedingham Road. It was built
 in 1884 by{George Courtauld}to        
 commemerate the death of his late wife
 An extention was added in 1920 as a   
 memorial to George Courtauld who owned
 the mill. The hospital was built for  
 the local people but is mostly used   
 for elderly people now. The funds     
 raised by the local people are used   
 for  the upkeep of equipment as well  
 as improving the facilities. Without  
 this support it is probable that the  
 hospital would have been closed long  
 ago. There are wonderful views of the 
 Colne Valley from the windows. The    
 land on the opposite side  was also   
 given by George Courtauld so that no  
 building could spoil the view of the  
 residents. The land is now planted by 
 Halstaed and District Horticural and  
 Chrysanthemum Society.                </content>
