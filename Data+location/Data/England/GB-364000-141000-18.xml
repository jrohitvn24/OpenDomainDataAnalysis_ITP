		<title>18DOULTING STONE.(TWO)</title>
		<content> Doulting Stone is like the famous{Bath
{Stone}but is much better. There are   
 three kinds of Stone: the fine grained
 stone, the coarse grained stone which 
 is better and{Doulting Grey}which is  
 the best of all three. Unfortunately  
 there isn't enough grey stone to make 
 it worth quarrying. They can't use    
 explosives because that would break   
 the stone into pieces too small for   
 building. Instead they use a Sampson  
 Electric Saw, pneumatic drills and a  
 crane to lift the saw and stone. It   
 can take anything from 30 minutes to  
 a whole day depending on the size of  
 the stone. The men can tell if it is a
 good piece of stone by hitting it with
 hammer: if there is a ringing sound it
 is a good piece. It is used in        
 buildings and has already been used in
{Wells, Bristol and Exeter Cathedrals  
 and lots of{churches}in England.      </content>
