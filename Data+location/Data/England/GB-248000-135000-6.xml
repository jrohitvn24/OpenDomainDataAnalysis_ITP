		<content> In the{1900's}boats from{Barnstaple}  
 and{Cardiff}unloaded loads of         
 limestone at{Velator}to be taken away 
 to the lime-kiln on the edge of the   
 Great field.There the limestone was   
 crushed and spread over the great     
 field as a sort of fertillizer.The    
 land at Velator is mostly farmed      
 except for about 5 acres which is used
 for factories and houses.Most of the  
 buildings at Velator are over 300     
 years old. {Marstage farm's}house in  
{1912}was burnt down so a new house was
 built with a tile roof.{Cattle}and    
{sheep}are the main livestock of       
 Velator.The railway which used to run 
 through part of Velator closed down in
 the 1970's.It went from{Ilfracombe    
 through Velator (Braunton) and ended  
 up at{Barnstaple.}This in turn        
 connected to the western route to     
{London.                               </content>
