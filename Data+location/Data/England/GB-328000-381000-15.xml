		<content> Home Farm covers 123 acres of land in 
 mid-Wirral.It is owned by{Viscount    
{Leverhulme.}Leverhulme Estates have   
 farmed the land since 1970.Before that
 it was tenanted.                      
   Home Farm is a dairy farm with 115  
{Guernsey cows.}They produce "gold     
 topped" milk.They also keep a Guernsey
 bull which is very fierce.The cows    
 graze in hedged pastures but are      
 restricted to certain parts of the    
 field by electric fencing.            
   Some of the fields grow{grass}which 
 is intensively managed and cut to feed
 the cows during the winter.           
   It is hoped that this year Home Farm
 will produce about 700 tons of good   
 quality{wheat}for bread,500 tons of   
 barley which is made into beer and    
 cattle cake,and 100 tons of{oil seed
