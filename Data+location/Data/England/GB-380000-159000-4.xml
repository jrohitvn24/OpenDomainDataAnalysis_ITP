		<content>  At the moment the SDP/Liberal        
 Alliance                              
 party is gaining popularity and has   
 just (May 1985) gained control of our 
 County Council. In Westminster the    
 Conservative party have problems which
 affect on Avon. Unemployment is very  
 high. There is insufficient money to  
 fund schools adequately. Schools      
 have to raise 'private' money from    
 parents to buy books and equipment.   
 There is not enough money to build new
 roads and bypasses, hospitals and     
 prisons. Our country is in an economic
 decline. We are not as poor as drought
 stricken African countries. Pop groups
 work voluntarily to raise millions of 
 pounds to feed the starving. Bob      
 Geldorf, a pop star, embarrassed the  
 government by organising a hugely     
 successful international concert to   
 raise money for starving Ethiopians.  </content>
