		<title>14THE OLD SUN INN</title>
		<content>The Old Sun is one of only two pubs in 
Heyford - at one time there were 9!    
The Old Sun, in Middle St., is built on
the site of a Monk's Hospice; a hospice
was a place where, in the Middle Ages, 
travellers could rest - an early hotel.
It is said that when the hospice was   
pulled down the stone was taken to     
build the old Manor House on the road  
to Upper Heyford. When this Manor House
was knocked down the stone was brought 
back and used in the building of the   
Old Sun over 200 years ago. The pub has
just had a new building added on,      
toilets and a new bar, but it has been 
built in the same style as the old     
buildings and so it merges in well.    
One of the Old Sun's regular customers 
is Albert Garrett, he is 86 years old  
and he lives next to the pub, in the   
house that was built in 1861 for the   
schoolmaster of that time.             </content>
