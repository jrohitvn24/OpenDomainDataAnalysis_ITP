		<content>   Sometimes we play "Off ground hit". 
 Here is how we play it.               
   Someone is up and everyone else has 
 to climb on top of something. The     
 person that is up has to try and catch
 you when you are not on top of        
 something. Then the person that's     
 caught has to be up.    Sarah Short.  
   To play "Doctor, Doctor" you need a 
 group of about five people. One person
 goes away so that he cannot see what  
 the others are doing. While he is away
 the other people join up in a circle  
 and weave in and out of each other and
 when their bodies and arms and legs   
 are all twisted together they shout   
 "Doctor, Doctor".                     
   The other person has to come back   
 and untwist them and get them back    
 into the original circle.             
   Everyone takes turns at being       
 doctor.            Johanna Stidson.   </content>
