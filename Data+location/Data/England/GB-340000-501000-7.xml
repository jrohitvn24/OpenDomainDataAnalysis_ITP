		<title>07Valley - development control</title>
		<content> Very strict control is exercised      
 by the Lake District Special Planning 
 Board on any kind of development, new 
 building (rare), alterations,         
 extensions. This has put a lot of     
 pressure on existing properties from  
 the many people who would like to live
 in such a pleasant area, thus prices  
 are high. Most possible conversions of
 barns have been carried out already,  
 usually within the last ten years.    
 The Howe, a farm of 340 acres with a  
 17th. century farmhouse and a more    
 modern family house, was sold recently
 for Â£440,000. In line with its policy 
 of trying to conserve the environment,
 the National Trust bought the farm and
 300 acres while the other house and   
 the rest of the land was bought       
 privately. The Trust also owns all the
 northern part of the valley beyond the
 survey area.                          </content>
