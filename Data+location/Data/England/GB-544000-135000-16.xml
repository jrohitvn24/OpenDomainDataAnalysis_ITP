		<title>16A day in my life</title>
		<content>   A typical Sunday for me would start 
 at 7 a.m. when I get up and put my    
 clothes on. At ten past I go          
 downstairs and have my breakfast.At   
 half past seven we put the boat on the
 trailer and connect the trailer to the
 car.By eight o'clock we are on the way
 to Worthing to go sailing.When we get 
 there we have a cup of tea.           
   We take the trailer off the car and 
 go into the boat park.We put the boat 
 together and by 9.30 we are dressing  
 in our wet suits.We push the boat off 
 the beach and wait for the race to    
 start.By 10 o'clock the cannon goes   
 'BANG' and we are off.Two hours later 
 the race is over and we return to the 
 beach.We have a cup of coffee.We then 
 have dinner in the club house.We put  
 the boat in the compound and set off  
 for home.On the way we stop at Jack &amp; 
 Jill windmills.We have tea at home.   </content>
