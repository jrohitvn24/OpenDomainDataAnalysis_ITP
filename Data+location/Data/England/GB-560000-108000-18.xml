		<title>181980s Transport on Horse-Eye</title>
		<content> Modern transport and large vehicles   
 have become an accepted essential for 
 todays way of life. However, large    
 agricultural machinery is often too   
 wide for narrow country lanes with    
 resulting damage to verges, hedgerows 
 and road surfaces. Public Transport   
 does not serve Horse-Eye Level &amp; the  
 local Post Bus Service has been       
 discontinued. The residential caravan 
 park is served by a volunteer bus     
 service called the Hailsham Town Bus  
 Limited. The bus is driven by         
 volunteers, providing four services   
 daily, Monday to Friday and Saturday  
 morning, with a flat fare of 15p. The 
 bus can be privately hired evenings &amp; 
 weekends. Local businesses sponsor the
 volunteer bus. Without this bus       
 service many people would be isolated.
 The area is under a flight path to    
 Gatwick Airport.                      </content>
