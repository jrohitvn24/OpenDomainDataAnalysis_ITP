		<content> The villages of Ashby Magna and       
 Peatling Parva have their own Parish  
 Councils.  The Parish Council is a    
 non-political body made up of elected 
 parishoners.  It is the voice of the  
 village and presents the villagers    
 point of view to the District Council 
 at Market Harborough and the          
 Leicestershire County Council at      
 Glenfield.  The Parish Councils belong
 to the Association of Parish Councils 
 which will advise and help them on    
 request.                              
                                       
 The villages are in the Parlimentary  
 constituency of Blaby and are         
 represented at the present time by    
 Nigel Lawson, the Chancellor of the   
 Exchequer in the Conservative         
 Government.
