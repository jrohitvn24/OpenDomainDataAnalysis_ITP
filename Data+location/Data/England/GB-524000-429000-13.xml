		<title>13EMMA'S PONY</title>
		<content>      Each morning my sister gets up   
 and checks the ponies' water and makes
 sure that they are alright, then she  
 feeds them. My pony is called Bonny.  
             Grooming                  
 I groom my pony with a body brush and 
 a curry comb. I pick his feet with a  
 hoof pick and then I oil them. In the 
 winter when he is very dirty I use a  
 dandy brush and a rubber glove. The   
 glove is for getting the hairs out if 
 he is moulting.                       
              Riding                   
 I ride my pony for at least 2 hours   
 every day to get him fit. I ride him  
 all over this area, cantering on grass
 and trotting. I jump as many safe     
 ditches as I can plus logs and hedges.
 If I'm riding alone I ride him in the 
 paddock.                              
                                       
                                       </content>
