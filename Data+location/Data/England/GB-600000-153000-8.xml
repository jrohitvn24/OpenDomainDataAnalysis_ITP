		<content> There are two churches in the area -  
 both Anglican.  St. Leonard at        
 Badlesmere, on which site a church was
 noted in the lO85 Domesday Book and   
 which today is notable for its box    
 pews and double decker pulpit as well 
 as its one bell brought from Reculver 
 Church in l83O, and St. Laurence,     
 Leaveland (a completely original l3th 
 Century building).  Together with the 
 parish churches at Selling, Throwley  
 and Sheldwich, these churches form the
 Benefice (created 25 June l985) of    
 Selling with Throwley and Sheldwich   
 with Badlesmere and Leaveland, the    
 present incumbent being the Rector,   
 the Reverend J.V.H. Russell.  Both    
 churches have small congregrations.   
 Each church is run by its own         
 Parochial Church Council.Non Anglicans
 are catered for in nearby towns.
