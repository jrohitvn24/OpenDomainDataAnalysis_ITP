		<content>    9.00 am                            
           Once in school I got my     
 books ready for my first lesson.  We  
 had the register and Mrs Burdett asked
 for children to get their dinner or   
 snack tickets from Mrs Lowe's office. 
                                       
    9.15 am                            
           Then off we went to our     
 first lesson which was science.  In   
 science we had to measure our height  
 and weight to see how much we had     
 grown in three months.                
                                       
   10.45 am                            
           After science it was        
 playtime.  At playtime I ate my crisps
 and then I talked to Elizabeth and    
 Amy.  Then the bell went  and I went  
 in for my next lesson.
