		<title>19School Visit Buckfastleigh</title>
		<content> On 5th June 1985 our school went by   
 coach to Buckfastleigh. It was for    
 Infants and a few Juniors who were not
 going to School Camp. Lots of parents 
 came. At Buckfastleigh we looked at   
 the museum there which had lots of    
 pictures of steam engines and there   
 were ships inside glass boxes. Later  
 we went on the platform to get on a   
 steam train. We went on the train to  
 Totnes. On the way we saw Lorraine    
 Chase, a television personality. At   
 Totnes we had a quick visit and got   
 back on the train to Buckfastleigh    
 where we went in the Butterfly Farm.  
 We had a worksheet to fill in. We also
 saw goldfish and rainbow trout.
