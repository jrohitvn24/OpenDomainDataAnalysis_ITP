		<title>13OLDHAM'S FAMOUS MARKET</title>
		<content>{THE OPEN MARKET.}IT IS OVER 100 YEARS 
 SINCE A MARKET STARTED IN OLDHAM.NOW  
 IT IS PART OF OLDHAM LIFE.IT IS CALLED
 THE TOMMY-FIELD AFTER THOMAS WHITTAKER
 WHO OWNED THE MEADOW ORIGINALLY.WE    
 THINK IT IS THE LARGEST LOCAL         
 AUTHORITY MARKET IN THE COUNTRY.IT HAS
 500 STALLS;SOME QUIET SELLING STALLS  
 AND SOME PITCHING STALLS.THE          
 ATMOSPHERE IS NOISY,BUSY AND          
 FRIENDLY.PEOPLE ENJOY SHOPPING THERE. 
 YOU CAN MEET MANY AMUSING CHARACTERS  
 THERE.                                
{THE COVERED MARKET.}THE VICTORIA      
 MARKET HALL (LISTED AS A BUILDING OF  
 HISTORICAL AND ARCHITECTURAL          
 IMPORTANCE) WAS BURNED DOWN IN 1974.  
 THE NEW HALL ISN'T POPULAR.IT COST    
 Â£250,000 AND THE COUNCIL SAID IT WAS  
 TEMPORARY,BUT IT IS STILL THERE.THE   
 STALL-HOLDERS SAY THERE ISN'T ENOUGH  
 ROOM TO DISPLAY GOODS.                </content>
