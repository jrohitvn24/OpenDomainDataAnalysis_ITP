		<title>11EASTHORPE CHURCH.</title>
		<content> Easthorpe Church is the same today as 
 it has been for very many years.Much  
 restoration has been carried out over 
 the years.It was damaged by a bomb in 
 the 2nd world war.Its overall         
 character has probably altered over   
 the centuries but it is still an      
 important English building.The church 
 is very plain and was built in the    
 12th century.The first Rector in the  
 church was in 1395.There are two      
 stained glass windows hanging in      
 frames;the rest of the windows are    
 quite small compared with a bigger    
 church.The key to open the church is  
 very big and heavy.There are 34       
 kneelers all embroidered by people in 
 the village.On one of the walls there 
 is a water colour painting that shows 
 how the original 12th century church  
 may have looked.
