People in Elford work very hard to keep
the village tidy.We hold a poster      
competition every year where we all    
draw posters to put on the village hall
which tells you to keep Elford tidy.We 
take part in the Best Kept Village     
Competition and we have won it in the  
past.Every Tuesday night Mr.Reynolds   
with a group of children and parents   
work in the village doing different    
jobs.We collect money for Action Aid,  
Save The Children and other causes.We  
have knitted squares for blankets to   
send to Etheopia.We try to be friendly 
with everyone and "DO AS WE WOULD BE   
DONE BY".We have a Garden Fete every   
year to raise money for the church.
