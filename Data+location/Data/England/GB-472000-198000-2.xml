I wake up at about 7.00 a.m., get out  
of bed and go downstairs to say "Good  
morning to my dog, Rosie. Then I get   
changed and Mummy changes and takes me 
to school which starts at 9.00 a.m. At 
school we all sit on the carpet and the
teacher takes the register. We do some 
work about Plains Indians, then we go  
out to play. Sometimes we play "It" and
"Chase" and "Cars". When we are allowed
on the field we play football and      
races. There are climbing bars to play 
on as well. When we go back into class 
we do some maths and language and sing 
songs, then we have dinner. After      
dinner we go out to play. We come in   
and do some more work then, at 3.15    
p.m. we go home. After school I get    
changed and go out to play with my     
friend James on bikes. When Daddy comes
home we have dinner and I go to bed.   </content>
