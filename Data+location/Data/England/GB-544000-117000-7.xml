		<content>   This{13th Century Church}commands   
 extensive views. Its congregation     
 comes from rural areas &amp; Ridgewood    
 which has a growing population. The   
 curate feels that the Services should 
 'suit' people living in the area. On  
 an average Sunday 25-30 people attend 
 the main{Communion Service.}Family    
 Services are more popular.            
   The Church has problems with its    
{heating.}As it is only used regularly 
 on Sundays instant heat is cheapest.  
 Since 1982 when the system broke,temp-
 orary heaters have been used but they 
 have damaged the fabric of the Church.
 Radiant heaters have now been approved
 by the{Diocesan Arts Council}although 
 they objected on aesthetic grounds.   
   The tapestry{kneelers}are special.  
 Each one represents a house in the    
 Parish. They were designed and made by
 people connected with the Parish.     </content>
