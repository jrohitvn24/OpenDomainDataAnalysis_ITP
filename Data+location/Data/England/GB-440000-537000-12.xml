		<title>12FARMING NEAR PETERLEE</title>
		<content>  On the farm you have to get up and   
 about 6o'clock to feed all the        
 animals-horses, pigs, cows, geese and 
 ducks.                                
  The fields have to be ploughed and   
 seeded.  You can seed them by hand but
 the quickest way is by the tractor    
 with a spreader on the back.  A       
 tractor is powered by diesel and they 
 cost a lot.                           
  In the summer the grass gets cut and 
 mowed for hay.  To make hay you need a
 tractor, hay bailer, sreader, cutter  
 and sun.  First you need to wait until
 the grass grows and then you cut it,  
 spread it and wait until it is dry.   
 Then it is bailed and kept in the barn
 for the horses to feed on.            
  Geese have to be carefully looked    
 after.  If you have geese you have to 
 lock them away at night so the fox    
 does not get them.                    </content>
