		<title>10LEISURE IN SAMPFORD</title>
		<content> There are very few facilities in this 
 area but in Great Sampford there is a 
 Womens Institute, a Football club,    
 Cricket club, (which is 200 years     
 old), the Brownies and the Guides. For
 Cubs and Scouts you must journey to   
 Thaxted or Ridgewell.  There is a     
 Badmington club which is held at the  
 Lord Butler Leisure Centre.  This is  
 run by Andrew Wisbey, a boy who lives 
 in the village.  After that there is  
 a session for the adults.  There are  
 many things at the Lord Butler which  
 people from Sampford attend.  Swimming
 and Rollerskating among them.  There  
 are a few things after school.  There 
 is a play area with a football pitch, 
 climbing frame, swings and a slide.   
 There is a Riding school owned by     
 Sarah Green.  Here children of almost 
 any age can ride a horse through the  
 village with supervision.             </content>
