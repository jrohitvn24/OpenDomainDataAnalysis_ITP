		<title>12Yeovil Livestock Market</title>
		<content>  Last Friday we went to the cattle    
 market.The cows we saw included black 
 &amp; white Friesian,white faced Hereford,
 &amp; an all black Aberdeen Angus with no 
 horns,(we were told that they make the
 best beef).The dairy cattle are mostly
 Friesian,or Jersey (which produce the 
 richest milk).On Mondays,fat sheep &amp;  
 cattle, &amp; pigs &amp; calves,are auctioned.
                                       
        There are 3 sale rings where   
 animals are auctioned.                
    In 1,store cattle (for farm stock).
    In 2,barren cows  (for meat).      
    In 3,dairy cows.                   
        About 200 barren cows were sold
 that day and that is typical.They     
 fetched between Â£450 and Â£700,depend- 
 ing  on weight.The bidding was very   
 fast.The cows were very cramped in    
 their pens &amp; we felt very sorry for   
                                  them.</content>
