		<title>01CHALFONT ST GILES SEER GREEN</title>
		<content>   This area covers the major part of  
Chalfont St Giles including the old    
picturesque village centre and the     
northern part of the much smaller vill 
age of Seer Green.Both nestle in very  
pleasantly wooded rural countryside    
and provide an excellent haven for the 
London commuter.Since the coming of    
the railway in the 1920s Seer Green    
has grown from a hamlet to a village   
of about 2,000 inhabitants.A new hous  
ing estate begun in the late 1970s pro 
vides housing in the middle executive  
range and has brought many more child  
ren to the village.Chalfont St Giles   
has also grown extensively since the   
1940s.Both villages were at one time   
rural farming communities.There is     
little industry and few of the inhabi  
tants work locally.
