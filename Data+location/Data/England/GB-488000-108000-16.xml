 Goodwood House has stables next to the
 house.They are private stables where  
 Lady March keeps her horses and other 
 stables where the racehorses are kept 
 when there is racing at Goodwood.     
 There are 3 dressage arenas, a main   
 one, and two practise ones.  There are
 two stands and five boxes for the     
 judges. There is a large building like
 a barn that is used as an indoor      
 riding school.                        
 Near the golf club are the paddocks   
 which is a large fenced field. There  
 is a cross country course running from
 the golf course to Goodwood House and 
 there is a hill which is used for the 
 gallops.
