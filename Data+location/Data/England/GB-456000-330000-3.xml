		<title>03RUDDINGTON FRAMEWORK COMPLEX</title>
		<content> This museum is on {CHAPEL STREET}and  
 is a row of cottages and the framework
 shops. {William Lee}invented the hand 
 frame in {1589}and by Victorian times 
{RUDDINGTON}was a centre for{FRAMEWORK 
{KNITTING.}                            
 They were a poor community who lived  
 in cramped cottages often with three  
 to a bed and worked long hours and    
 even the children were seamers and    
 winders.The boys had to light the fire
 early in the morning to warm the      
 machines so the factory was very      
 stuffy.                               
 The cottages are furnished as they    
 would have been in{1850.}             
 Nowadays when the museum is open you  
 can see {Peta Lewis}using the heavy   
 machines and {Audrey Turner} using the
 stocking knitting machine. The socks  
 and scarves can be bought in the shop.
