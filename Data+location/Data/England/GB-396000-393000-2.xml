    On the edge of Hattersley is our   
Primary School.  It has been on this   
site just below Holy Trinity Church in 
Higham Lane, Gee Cross, since 1858.    
The school was used for worship too    
until the church was built in 1874.    
    We still have the original three   
classrooms which the younger children  
still use.  The additional classrooms  
are used by the Juniors.               
    We used to have to go outside to   
the toilet.  This was terrible when it 
was raining or snowing.  Now we have   
indoor toilets and these are much      
better.                                
    We learn more by research and      
discussion now and we have the use of a
computer. We work with graphs, Venn    
Diagrams and in metres,kilometres,grams
kilograms,millilitres and litres       
instead of the old measures.           </content>
