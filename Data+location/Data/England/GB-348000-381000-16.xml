		<title>16Poltergeist of Byron St</title>
		<content> Ellen Whittle was born in 1893.       
 She lived at No.1 Byron St.for 15     
 years before the trouble started.After
 darkness a poltergeist was said to    
 have taken over.In fits of temper it  
 would hurl wardrobes across the room, 
 rip up carpets and destroy furniture. 
 Ellen Whittle survived two months of  
 these terrifying experiences before   
 her death on the 22nd of October.That 
 evening she was walking along the edge
 of a nearby disused quarry,when she   
 fell to her death.                    
 No one has proved any conection       
 between her death and the poltergeist.
 Various scientists and experts were   
 called in to investigate the          
 occurences and their verdict was that 
 it was genuine.However the usual      
 features of a poltergeist were not    
 found i.e.no small naughty child,few  
 noises and no motive for a hoax!      </content>
