		<content> THE ONLY MILITARY PRESENCE IN OUR AREA
 IS THE RAF.  HOWEVER, IT IS A VERY    
 IMPORTANT PART OF THE LIFE IN OUR     
 AREA BECAUSE THE RAF AIR STATION AT   
 NEARBY ODIHAM IN FACT COVERS MUCH OF  
 OUR BLOCK.  IT IS A MAJOR HELICOPTER  
 BASE AND EVERY DAY WE CAN SEE AND HEAR
 THE HELICOPTERS TRAINING, USUALLY     
 FLYING LOW ACROSS THE AREA CARRYING   
 VERY LARGE LOADS IN NETS UNDERNEATH.  
 THE BASE HAS BEEN THERE SINCE ABOUT   
 1930 SO MOST PEOPLE HAVE BECOME USED  
 TO  THE NOISE AND DONT MIND IT. ALSO, 
 THE BASE DOES EMPLOY SOME LOCAL PEOPLE
 THOUGH NOT VERY MANY. THE BASE BECAME 
 VERY IMPORTANT IN 1982 BECAUSE IT WAS 
 FROM THERE THAT MANY OF THE LARGE     
 CHINOOK HELICPTERS THAT WERE USED IN  
 THE FALKLANDS WAR ORIGINATED.
