		<title>12The new railway in Trimley</title>
		<content>  Felixstowe Docks have two            
Freightliner Terminals,where containers
are loaded on to railway wagons. One is
in our block. The trains have to travel
right through the docks to join the    
line which passes through Trimley,     
causing long traffic delays. To avoid  
these delays,the Dock Company planned  
a new railway from the Walton          
Freightliner Terminal to the Ipswich   
line near Trimley Station, following   
roughly along Byle Fleet.              
  People living near the route objected
and the Trimley Preservation Society   
was formed to oppose the private bill  
in Parliament,but it was still passed. 
The line has been marked out and no    
crops have been grown on the route     
this   year,but no work has begun yet. 
Some people think that the line will be
noisy and  that dock buildings will    
come closer to the village.            </content>
