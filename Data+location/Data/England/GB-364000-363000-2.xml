		<content> The houses in the area are almost     
 equally divided between owner-occupied
 and council owned.Older properties    
 dating back to the end of the 19th and
 the early 20th century are to be found
 in Weaver St. Ways Green, Gladstone   
 St.and Swanlow Lane.Most have been    
 fully modernised.The Dene Estate was  
 built immediately after W.W.2 for the 
 families of returning                 
 servicemen.Consequently many of the   
 roads were named after famous battles 
 _Alemein Drive,Dunkirk Drive etc.Large
 new owner occupied estates are found  
 in the west of the area.Also in the   
 west the Glebe Green council estate   
 was built in the late '60s to         
 accomodate Liverpool overspill        
 families who moved to Winsford under a
 Council sponsored scheme.During the   
 period 1961 to 1971 the population of 
 Winsford rose from 12,760 to 24,934.  </content>
