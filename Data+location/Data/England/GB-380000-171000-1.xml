		<content> Within this twelve kilometre block    
 there is the main part of the village 
 of Colerne, part of Slaughterford     
 village, the hamlet of Thickwood and  
 Colerne airfield which now includes   
 Azimghur Barracks which is the base   
 for Junior Leaders' Regiment R.C.T..  
                                       
 Colerne is a hill village, 500 feet   
 above sea level, on an outlying spur  
 of the Cotswolds. The old village,    
 which has been declared a conservation
 area, is in the Cotswolds style and   
 includes a 13th century Church and a  
 number of buildings listed as being of
 architectural or historical interest. 
                                       
 The surounding farmland is mainly used
 for cereal crops and grass for        
 livestock. Part of the area has been  
 designated as an area of outstanding  
 natural beauty.                       </content>
