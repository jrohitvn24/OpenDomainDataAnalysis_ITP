		<title>10A TYPICAL SUNDAY</title>
		<content> On a Sunday I usually get up at about 
 7 o'clock. I have buttered toast and  
 bacon and egg for breakfast. I have   
 some apple juice to drink. Then I play
 football in the garden. Then I go into
 my bedroom to play snooker. For dinner
 I usually have roast potatoes, pork,  
 spring cabbage and Yorkshire pudding, 
 and also have a drink of milk. Then I 
 go and call on one of my friends. I   
 usually ask them if they want to play 
 cricket. For tea I would usually have 
 some tomato soup. I have ice-cream and
 a drink of water. Then I go to the    
 golf club to play golf with my Dad.   
 For supper I have cornflakes and milk 
 and sugar and a drink of milk. Then I 
 watch the television and finally I go 
 to bed at 9 o'clock.                  
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
