		<title>02 INTRODUCTION</title>
		<content>   This first page is an introduction  
 to the area we know today as{Fulstow. 
                                       
   Fulstow is a small village some 8   
 miles to the north of the market town 
 of Louth,with a population of roughly 
 500.The people of the village mainly  
 work on or around farms.Most of the  {
 land is covered by crops and grazing  
 pasture.We have a pig farm,an egg farm
 and many other{farms}in and about the 
 village.It is a fairly quiet village  
 and although we are quite close to the
 sea it isn't a seaside holiday resort.
  People come from the surrounding area
 to use the new village hall and other 
{leisure}activities,yet many villagers 
 travel to Grimsby, or Louth, both to  
 work and for their leisure.           
  Many people have moved into this area
 from large towns because it is a most 
 peaceful and pretty village.          </content>
