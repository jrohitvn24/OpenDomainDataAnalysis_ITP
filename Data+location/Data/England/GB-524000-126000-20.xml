		<title>20POPULATION/SLAUGHAM</title>
		<content> The population of Slaugham has        
 not changed very much in the last     
 thirty years as it is in a            
 conservation area and no new houses   
 can be built. The original residents  
 of Slaugham, now retired,were mainly  
 agricultural workers. This is not so  
 today because of new technology.      
 Newer residents have been attracted   
 by the peace. Some people only live   
 in Slaugham during holidays and       
 weekends. A lot of non residents      
 visit Slaugham's lakes and pub at     
 weekends. This causes a parking       
 problem in the village. {             
{This survey was carried out by 12 year
{old pupils at the Desmond Anderson    
{Middle School, Tilgate, Crawley,W.Sx. 
{during the Summer Term 1985. We would 
{like to thank all the residents of    
{Slaugham, Staplefield and Warninglid  
{for all their help. }                 </content>
