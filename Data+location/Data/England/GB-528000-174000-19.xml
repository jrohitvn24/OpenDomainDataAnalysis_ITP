		<content>Lambeth is a typical Inner City Borough
situated on the South Bank of the River
Thames. Amongst the most famous        
features of the Borough is the Market  
in Brixton. The huge variety of fruit, 
fish, vegetables and meat reflects the 
equally rich racial composition of the 
community. The Irish are technically   
the largest Group, followed by Jamaican
and then white British. Brixton is     
perhaps equally well known to          
outsiders for the two Uprisings in     
April 1981 and October '85, when local 
people expressed their anger at        
persistent racism on the part of local 
police. Physical scars of the street   
fighting are still visible in many     
parts of Brixton and Clapham and       
increased use of metal roller shutters 
on shops is evidence too.
