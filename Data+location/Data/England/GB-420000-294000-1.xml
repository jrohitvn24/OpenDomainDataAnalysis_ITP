		<title>0120 YEARS AGO IN KINGSBURY</title>
		<content> 20 years ago, Kingsbury was a quiet   
 village situated on a hill overlooking
 the River Tame,surrounded by farmland,
 and dominated by its Parish Church,St.
 Peter's and St.Paul's.Today it is a   
 large,busy village with new housing   
 estates growing around it.Many aspects
 of the old village have vanished,with 
 the new taking over. A very large Oil 
 Terminus has been constructed on the  
 outskirts;west of the village a Water 
 Park Development is expanding.The A51 
 Tamworth Road runs through the village
 and part of the new M42 Motorway runs 
 within one mile of Kingsbury,cutting  
 through the Water Park.Many working   
 inhabitants commute to Birmingham,    
 Coventry or Tamworth.The village is   
 very busy during the morning and      
 evening rush hours,but most other     
 times it takes on the atmosphere of a 
 quiet,rural village.                  </content>
