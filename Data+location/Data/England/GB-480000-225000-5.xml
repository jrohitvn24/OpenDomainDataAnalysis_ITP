		<content>     When we get to Swanbourne First   
School we play in the playground until 
9 o'clock when the bell rings.We line  
up by class and a teacher sends us in. 
We fetch our hymn-books and go to the  
Infants' classroom for Assembly.Then we
go to our classroom and work till      
10.30.At playtime we take our toys out-
side.We play "Bulldog" or skip or talk 
or play "Grandmother's Footsteps".We   
come in at 10.45 and work till         
dinner-time at 12. We all have dinner  
in the Infants' classroom. 17 children 
bring sandwiches and 22 eat dinner.We  
are ready to play again from 12.40 to  
1.15.At 2.30 we stop for another       
quarter hour's playtime and work till  
3.30 when we go home.                  
     15 children catch the school bus  
to Little Horwood and the others walk  
or go by car.
