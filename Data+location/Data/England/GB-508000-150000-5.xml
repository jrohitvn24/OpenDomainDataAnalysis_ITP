		<content> It is interesting that none of the    
 8 farms covered in this area has a    
 dairy herd.  4 farms have store       
 cattle, one has sheep, pigs &amp; store   
 cattle &amp; one has poultry &amp; store      
 cattle.  The main reason for this is  
 that a few years ago in order to re-  
 duce excess milk production, it was   
 Government policy to pay farmers to   
 change from dairy to crops.  Cash     
 crops such as roots and grain are     
 grown on 250 of its 300 acres.  Apart 
 from hay &amp; straw available from some  
 farms, 3 farms sell to the public from
 their premises.  Openview Farm sells  
 poultry, Grove Farm sells fruit &amp;     
 Tollgate Farm sells a variety of meat,
 some from their own stock, fish (fresh
 &amp; frozen, fruit and vegetables, eggs &amp;
 homemade pate and jams.  All these    
 units are situated on the main road.
