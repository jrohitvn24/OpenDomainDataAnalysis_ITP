 The Area is well served by newspapers.
 Besides the national dailies there are
 two local weekly newspapers, the      
{Berrow's Journal,}based in Worcester  
 and reputedly the world's oldest      
 newspaper and the{Evesham Journal.    
 Both papers cost about 25 pence and   
 are published each Thursday.  They    
 have local Pershore editions which    
 carry local news.                     
 A local radio station,{"Radio Wyvern",
 broadcasts to the area and struggles  
 to attract advertising, its future    
 being uncertain in a very competitive 
 field.                                
 Several free papers are distributed:  
{"The Admag", "The Worcester Source"   
 and a quarterly advertising paper{"The
{Vale News". }All these publications   
 are aimed at selling products rather  
 than purveying news.                  </content>
