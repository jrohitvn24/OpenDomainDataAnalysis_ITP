		<title>03The Stud</title>
		<content> The stud is owned by Lord Howard De-  
 Wallden.He also owns another stud.    
 The main attraction there is Kris the 
 Stallion.Mares come from all over the 
 world to see this one horse.When you  
 first go into the stud there are two  
 lodge houses I live in one of them.   
 As you go further up the road there   
 are two fields on either side of the  
 road which are going to be hay.There  
 is a small wood on both sides of the  
 grass as you go up the road more you  
 come to some isolation boxes.The      
 mares go there when they first come to
 see Kris.The small wood then joins up 
 to make one big wood called Bell Rush.
 Then you go into the park were they   
 keep some cattle.Then if you turn     
 right then you go to the spare boxes  
 where the stud manager keeps his      
 horses.There are some more houses down
                                       </content>
