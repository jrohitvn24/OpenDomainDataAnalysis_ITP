		<content> The river Tees between High Force and 
 Lowforce runs along the southern edge 
 of the block.  Two noth bank          
 tributaries, Etters Gill Beck and     
 Bowlee Beck flow south from the fells 
 to the main stream.  The main B6277   
 road follows the north bank of the    
 river and is joined by 2 side roads   
 from Ettersgill and Flushiemere.      
 Isolated white washed farms are       
 scattered throughout the area, with   
 stone barns in many fields.  The      
 valley floor has some woodland but    
 mainly hay meadows.  Northwards rising
 ground is covered by stone walled     
 intake pastures used for stock        
 rearing. Visitors are catered for with
 Car Parks and Picnic Areas at High    
 Force Hotel and at Bowlees.  The      
 latter has a Visitor Centre in an old 
 chapel.  The Pennine Way follows the  
 south bank of the river Tees.         </content>
