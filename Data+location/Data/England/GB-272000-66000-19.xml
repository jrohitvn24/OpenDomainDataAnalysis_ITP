		<content> Most little towns in S.E. England are 
 having good times.Buckfastleigh is the
 same;it is a really busy little place.
 Normally the traffic is so thick      
 people can hardly get from one side to
 the other.It is fortunate a dual      
 carriageway goes around the town and a
 big quarry lies nearby so the stone   
 for the road is easy to process.Most  
 of the old trades have gone and have  
 been replaced by little workshops,    
 though they still dress the skins,    
 adorn them and export them.The folks  
 here are most friendly and always     
 thoughtful towards their neighbours.  
 Buckfastleigh is world famous for the 
 caves and tourists come from          
 everywhere to enjoy the hills around  
 Dartmoor and the beautiful meadows of 
 the South Hams as far as the sea.
