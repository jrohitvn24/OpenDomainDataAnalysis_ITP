		<content> Along the banks of the streams there  
 are water voles, while damsel flies,  
 dragon flies, and mayflies dance above
 the water. A few ponds still have a   
 population of newts, toads and frogs  
 in the spring. On the tops of the     
 higher knolls, bracken abounds,       
 providing cover for a variety of      
 mammals and birds, and in open        
 patches, there are knapweeds,         
 harebells, and fleabanes. In valleys  
 which are not tilled, Dyers Greenweed,
 and spotted orchid can be found,      
 whilst in one or two fields which have
 been left unploughed, the meadow      
 saffron still grows. Where weedkillers
 have not been used,(rare) a few       
 poppies are evident, and curlews and  
 peewits return to breed each year.    
 Moles are abundant and hares can be   
 seen in March. CONTINUED ON NEXT PAGE
