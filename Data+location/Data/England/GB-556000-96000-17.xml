		<title>17Education 1: West Eastbourne</title>
		<content>    The information on Education is    
 based on an interview with Mr Rex     
 Lord, formerly joint headmaster of    
 St. Bede's school.                    
    There are several private schools  
 in this area. These include Eastbourne
 College, St.Bede's, St.Andrew's, Moira
 House and Beresford House. Most of    
 these schools dated from the 1890s    
 when the Duke of Devonshire owned the 
 land. Large houses were built for     
 large families and land was also      
 available for private schools. Many   
 families went abroad to different     
 parts of the empire, especially to    
 India. Problems of climate meant that 
 children needed to be educated at     
 home. Money was in plentiful supply   
 and Eastbourne with its fine sea front
 and the Downs was ideal for parents   
 who wanted to visit their children.
