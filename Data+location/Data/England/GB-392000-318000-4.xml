		<title>04Marshlands Special School.</title>
		<content>  Marshlands School opened in 1976.    
There are 52 children there, ranging   
from 2 to 19 years, each having a      
special disability, usually Down's     
Syndrome or Cerebral Palsy which       
prevents them from attending a normal  
primary school.                        
  The children come from within a      
radius of nine miles, so transport can 
be a problem.  Taxis are used every day
but money is being raised to provide a 
minibus with a tail lift.  There are   
lots of staff at Marshlands as the     
children need plenty of attention.     
  Behaviour modification is used to    
encourage the children to do well, and 
computers are also used to aid         
learning.  The average leaving age is  
17.  They then go to an Adult Day Care 
or Training Centre.
