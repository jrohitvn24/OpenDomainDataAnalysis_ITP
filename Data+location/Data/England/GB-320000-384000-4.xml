		<title>04HOUSING IN THE AREA.</title>
		<content>   There is a very wide variety of     
 housing within the area and this is   
 reflected in the price range that is  
 available from Â£20,000 to Â£100,000.   
   There is no council housing within  
 the area.The centre of West Kirby     
 comprises mainly of low cost older    
 terraced housing with some very large 
 semi-detached older properties many of
 which have been converted into flats. 
 Many of these flats and houses are    
 available as rented accomodation.     
   There has been some more modern     
 development in West Kirby and there   
 are large numbers of more expensive   
 detached properties.                  
    Caldy is a high priced luxury      
 housing area where the price of       
 houses can be well over Â£100,000.     
   Newton has three large estates and  
 some smaller developments of detached 
 and semi-detached housing.            </content>
