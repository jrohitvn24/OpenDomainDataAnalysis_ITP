		<content>{  Mr.Jolliffe}came to talk to us today
 . He was born in{Ryde in 1902}and when
 he grew up he ran the family grocery  
 shop at the corner of{Green Street and
{High Street.}In his shop everything   
 was loose so he had to weigh          
 everything himself in{pounds and      
{ounces}then he put them into bags.    
   When{Mr.Joliffe}went to school if he
 got his spellings wrong they had to   
 write it out at home{50 times.}At home
 when they wanted a bath they had to go
 down stairs to get the hot water,then 
 go all the way back up stairs to put  
 the water in the bath.                
   The games he liked to play on the   
 road were{marbles and whip and top.   
{Schools were so cold}that children    
 would take an old cocoa tin filled    
 with smouldering rags to use as a{hand
{warmer.  }                            
                                       </content>
