		<content>     How the Reserve is looked after.{ 
{    ________________________________  
     There is a warden who is          
 responsible for maintainance in the   
{nature reserve.}The{nature reserve    
{warden}is at present building a nature
 trail through part of the reserve. His
 job mainly concerns looking after the 
 wildlife and keeping the reeds        
 watered; he does this by trapping     
 water in ditches with{sluice gates}and
 in dry weather they are opened to     
 water the reeds.                      
                                       
     There is a good car park specially
 for the Reserve, at the{Stodmarsh}end.
 The footpath through the reserve is   
 built upon the{Lampen Wall.}A new wall
 is now being built in and around the  
 reserve to prevent the salt water of  
 the Stour from entering the lakes.
