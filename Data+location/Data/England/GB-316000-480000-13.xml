		<title>13ELEPHANT ROCK</title>
		<content> ELEPHANT ROCK IS ONE OF MY FAVOURITE  
 PLACES. THE REASON WHY IT IS MY       
 FAVOURITE PLACE IS THAT IT IS EASY TO 
 CLIMB. IT IS CALLED ELEPHANT ROCK     
 BECAUSE IT IS SHAPED LIKE AN ELEPHANT.
 THERE IS A CLIMB KNOWN BY THE         
 CLIMBERS OF MILLOM CALLED THE TRUNK.  
 IT IS QUITE A HARD CLIMB BECAUSE MY   
 DAD COULD NOT MAKE IT LAST TIME WE    
 WENT UP THERE. THERE ARE LOTS OF OTHER
 WAYS UP THAT ARE QUITE EASY AND THAT  
 CHILDREN OF ABOUT SIX LIKE MY SISTER, 
 CAN MANAGE. THE WALK UP FROM THE ROAD 
 TAKES ABOUT TEN MINUTES. IT IS NICE   
 EXCEPT FOR THE GORSE WHICH IS SO      
 PRICKLY WHEN YOU TRY TO GET THROUGH   
 IT. THE VIEW FROM THE TOP IS VERY GOOD
 ON A CLEAR DAY. YOU CAN SEE THE SLAG  
 BANK AND SHIPYARDS AT BARROW WHICH ARE
 ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DUDDON       
 ESTUARY.                              
                                       </content>
