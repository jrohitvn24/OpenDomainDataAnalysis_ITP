		<title>11FLAMBOROUGH SWORD DANCE</title>
		<content> The sword dance is an old Flamborough 
 tradition originally performed by a   
 team of 8 fishermen using wooden      
 swords. The dance was formerly done   
 annually a few days before and after  
 Christmas. A similar dance exists in  
 Sweden and it is likely that the dance
 was brought to the village by the     
 Vikings. The traditional clothes worn 
 were white trousers, navy jerseys and 
 sealskin caps. The movements of the   
 dance were first recorded by folk     
 dance enthusiast Cecil Sharp, when he 
 visited Flamborough. Two fishermen    
 returned to London with him to pass on
 their knowledge. The dance consists of
 several intricate figures. It is begun
 by the dancers making a star with the 
 interlocking swords. The dance is     
 still performed to a traditional      
 Flamborough tune "Old Johnny Walker", 
 a vigarous skipping step is used.     </content>
