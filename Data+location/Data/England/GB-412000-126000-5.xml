		<title>05BRITFORD VILLAGE , SALISBURY</title>
		<content>    In Britford is a canal which was a 
 17th c. attempt to bypass unnavigable 
 stretches of the river Avon.It once   
 had a lock on it. The gates have now  
 disappeared leaving only the stonework
 on either side of the lock. The canal 
 fell out of use in the 18th c. The    
 lock was later converted to a         
 weir which still stands.              
    The village is partly water-meadow 
 &amp; the land is mostly farm land. There 
 are a few streams in the village &amp;    
 there are quite a few big houses &amp;    
 also council houses. Unusually there  
 is no shop,but there is a church &amp;    
 school. There are four main areas of  
 housing &amp; farms.
