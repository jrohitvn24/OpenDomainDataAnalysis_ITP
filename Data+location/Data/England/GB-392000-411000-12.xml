 At school we play Westham. You        
 normally play with four people. One   
 person is in the net and the rest are 
 outside. The netter starts with ten   
 points and the rest have nine. You    
 have to volley the ball into the net. 
 If it's not a volley you lose a point 
 and go in the net. This carries on    
 until one of the players gets down to 
 0 points.                             
{DANISH LONGBALL}                      
 This is a good game but tiring. It is 
 a team game. A bowling and a batting  
 captain are picked. The batting team  
 bats first and the other team fields. 
 The first batter hits the ball with   
 their hand and runs to the other end  
 of the pitch. If they hit the ball far
 enough they can run back to score two 
 points. You are out if you are caught,
 stumped or hit by the ball            </content>
