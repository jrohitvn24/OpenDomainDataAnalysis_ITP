		<title>12CRICKET CLUB</title>
		<content> Founded early 20C.  The ground, which 
 is still used today, was provided by  
 the Maryon-Wilson family of Fitzjohns.
 First President was Revd John         
 Maryon-Wilson.  Originally club       
 members also played football during   
 the winter against other local        
 villages.  The old brick-built        
 clubroom has been replaced by a modern
 licenced clubhouse and the grounds are
 now leased on a 99 year tenancy.      
 Since l980 a single wicket competition
 has been held annually in which club  
 members compete against each other.   
 The Maryon-Wilson cup is awarded to   
 the winner (see photo No.3 - Lady     
 Janet Maryon-Wilson presents cup to   
 Paul Short).  The Club is the only    
 social meeting place in the village   
 since the closing of The Griffin      
 public house (now The Grange - a      
 private house) in the l920s.          </content>
