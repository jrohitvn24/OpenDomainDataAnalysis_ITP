		<content> Problems have been overcome, to some  
 extent, in this project in that       
 precise wording has had to be used in 
 order not to misrepresent facts about 
 the area. The limit of our assignment 
 cut halfway through the Village of    
 Bowerchalke. Thus, the Public House,  
 Baptist Church &amp; Trout Farm were all  
 excluded, and each contributes        
 significantly to Village Life.        
 Credit is due to all the Farmers, a   
 Forest Ranger &amp; a Church Warden:      
 people freely gave us facts and       
 expressed their attitudes &amp;           
 concerns.The BOWERCHALKE WOMEN'S      
 INSTITUTE has undertaken this project 
 in their Diamond Jubilee year -       
 Jane Jenkin, Mildred Shayler, Louisa  
 Jones.   We acknowledge the help of   
 Paul Turner, Lecturer, Salisbury      
 College of Technology, for his        
 assistance in using the computer.     </content>
