		<content> Whiteheath Junior School has just had 
 a new block built with 6 classrooms 2 
 resource areas,a group room,stockrooms
 and cloakrooms.The classrooms all have
 outside covered areas, spotlighting,  
 film screens, a carpet and hessian    
 covered walls.Originally the school   
 was a primary but the infant is now a 
 separate school and the hut classrooms
 have been demolished.The school lost  
 two teachers through redeployment in  
 the last two years.It has 4 1st/2nd yr
 vertical groups and 4 3rd/4ths. There 
 are many clubs archery,popmobility,gym

{which did the amenties count + typing.
 I lived for 6 years in Saudia Arabia. 
 I think Whiteheath has a nice approach
 and I enjoy it very much.At 250 pupils
 it is smaller than my other schools.  </content>
