		<content>    The church is one of few Island    
 churches to be recorded in the        
 Domesday book. Its main feature is the
{Norman tower}with walls 5 feet thick. 
    There was no way in from outside.  
 It was used as a refuge and a place   
 defence.There is a narrow splral      
 staircase in the North West corner    
 of the tower built into the tower.    
 There are 56 steps to the top.        
    First we climbed up to the floor   
 where the{two bells}are hung. Then we 
 climbed up further. We climbed up a   
 short metal ladder (it came from a    
 railway signal box) to push the heavy 
 trap door open. We climbed out onto   
 the{roof}of the tower.                
    We could see a long way. We could  
 see the grass cutters in the fields at
 Homestead Farm. We looked down on the 
 village - the old and new houses.
