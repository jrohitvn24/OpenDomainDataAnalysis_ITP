		<title>03THE UPLANDS WEST OF PENRYN</title>
		<content> This is a fairly flat rural area      
 (ranging from 150 to 200 metres above 
 sea level). It is predominantly       
 agricultural with dairy cattle and a  
 mixture of crops. There are 2 large   
 granite quarries, one with processing 
 facilities e.g. producing building    
 blocks, and a third only partly in the
 area plus several disused quarries.   
 There are two small villages, Rame and
 Longdowns, straddling the one major   
 road (A394 Penryn-Helston) each with  
 basic shopping facilities. Longdowns  
 had a small trading estate of small   
 wholesalers and very light industry.  
 The area also included the outskirts  
 of Mabe including the only school in  
 the area, shortly to be moved to      
 another site. An interesting experi-  
 mental project at the old Rosemanowas 
 quarry involves heating water by      
 pumping it through hot rocks.         </content>
