		<content> The place of the {Public House}in the 
 country is paramount. They are places 
 for meeting friends, gossip, good     
 conversation and playing games,not    
 to mention the beer and cider. The    
 area has five pubs, all excellent and 
 two hotel bars.The three most popular 
 games played in pubs are cribbage,    
 dominoes and darts. In the Wintertime 
 these games are played between pubs as
 is the Quiz game. Tippit, Quoits,     
 Table Skittles, Shove-halfpenny and   
 Draughts are some of the older games  
 which are not so often played now. The
 pub is also a clearing house for local
 news and rumour, it is a centre for   
 charities and the public houses of    
 Campden have raised large amounts of  
 money to help good causes. Three of   
 the area pulic houses are owned by the
 brewery and two are privately owned or
 "free houses".                        </content>
