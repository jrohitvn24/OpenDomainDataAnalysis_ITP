 Until recent reorganization ATCHAM was
 the name of a large rural district.Now
 it hardly qualifies as a village.Along
 one edge of the village runs the busy 
 A5 taking traffic from N.Wales to     
 London.                               
 The{MYTTON AND MERMAID}hotel is a  red
 brick Georgian building formerly the  
 Dower house of the Berwick family.    
 Atcham has two bridges-a new one to   
 take modern traffic which was built   
 next to John Gwynne's l8th C.structure
 now only used by pedestrians.         
 The{VILLAGE HALL}was an old MALTHOUSE 
 used for grinding barley and has      
 retained some fine old beams.It was   
 given to the village as a             
 W.W.1. memorial by Lord Berwick.      
 Each Spring a{DAFFODIL WALK}takes     
 place to raise money for St.Eatas.
