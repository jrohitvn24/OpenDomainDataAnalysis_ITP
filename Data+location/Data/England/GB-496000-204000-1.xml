		<title>01FARMING</title>
		<content> The area is one of mixed farming.Crops
 grown inclued grass, for hay and      
 silage, barley and rape seed. There is
 some stock rearing and dairy farming. 
 A stud farm breeding thoroughbred     
 horses is in the area, also a large   
 horticultural nursery extending to    
 some 10 acres growing chrysanthemums  
 under glass for the London market.    
 Farms are generally quite small, 100  
 acres or below, but there is one large
 dairy farm of some 900 acres. Farmland
 in this area has become somewhat      
 fragmented over the past few years    
 with larger units being split up and  
 sold off in smaller lots of 4 to 25   
 acres, to be used as grazing for      
 horses. Fields tend to be small, 8 to 
 15 acres with established hedgerows.  
 Apples were extensively grown here    
 some years ago but there is now only  
 one commercial orchard left.          </content>
