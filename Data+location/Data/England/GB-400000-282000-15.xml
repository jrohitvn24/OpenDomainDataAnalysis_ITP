		<content>   Smoking is a danger to health and   
should be stopped. Some people smoke 40
or more cigarettes a day. After a while
it restricts breathing, clogs tubes,   
becomes bronchitis &amp; eventually can end
up as lung cancer. Once people start it
is difficult to stop. Some children    
were encouraged to smoke by their      
parents, others steal them from older  
brothers &amp; sisters.                    
   Another concern is glue sniffing    
which is becoming a problem amongst    
young people. We have seen children of 
14-16yrs glue sniffing near our school.
They usually put some glue or something
similar into a plastic bag, hold the   
bag over their mouth &amp; breathe deeply. 
   We have seen them do some strange &amp; 
dangerous things,sometimes the police  
have been called.Effects of glue       
sniffing are sores around the          
mouth, internal bleeding &amp; death.      </content>
