		<title>08WENNINGTON - THE COMMUNITY</title>
		<content> The community consists basically of   
 farming families with a few           
 professional people moving in and out,
 rarely staying unless the remoteness  
 of the village appeals to them. Most  
 outsiders work away from the village, 
 have their children educated elsewhere
 and socialise outside as well.        
 Although some local children retain an
 interest in farming there seems to be 
 a tendency for them to move away from 
 the village, having been educated to a
 higher degree than their parents and  
 having formed ideas and opinions which
 deter them from staying in such a     
 remote place. However, it is felt     
 there will always be a community here 
 and the farming will continue despite 
 the changes.
