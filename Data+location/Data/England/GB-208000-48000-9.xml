{______________________                
{ }One man told us how he had worked on
 the estate as a lad and he gave us    
 this information :-                   
  At that time all the woods had big   
{timber trees}in, especially Corsican  
 Pine.There was a herd of{10 wild goats
 out on the point.The cliffs were      
 covered with{sea bird nests}of all    
 kinds including{puffins.Egg collection
 during{the War}ended this.Another     
 cause may also have been the increase 
 of human activity due to the          
{shipbuilding at Par}and the shooting  
 range on{Blackhead Point}opposite.The 
 local Hunt always began their day's   
 hunting at the Beacon as there was    
 often a{family of foxes}in the wood.He
 said they hardly saw anyone except the
 odd visitor now and again.
