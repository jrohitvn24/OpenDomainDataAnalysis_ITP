 to the S.W. of Cradley Heath in the   
 old grounds of{Haden Hall.}The centre 
 has two swimming pools,three squash   
 courts ,two sports halls,a weight-    
 lifting  room,a sauna and a bar.These 
 provide venues for karate lessons,    
 5-a-side tournaments,a dieting club   
 and old time dancing.                 
  When we carried out a street survey  
 we found that 48% of a mixed age range
 group used the centre.                
  Most peoples spare time is taken up  
 by watching television, but 46% go to 
 the cinema once a month,63% go to a   
 pub at least once a week and 70% go   
 weekly to some recreational activity. 
  Most people were satisfied with the  
 recreational facilities provided in   
 the area.However,a few did feel that  
 there was a need for more childrens   
 facilities.                           </content>
