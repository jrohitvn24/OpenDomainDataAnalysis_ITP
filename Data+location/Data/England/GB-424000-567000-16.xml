		<title>16HOUSES IN GOSFORTH</title>
		<content> The earliest terraced houses are made 
 of sandstone and the roofs are made of
 slate. The Causey Street houses are   
 about 150 years old; they do not have 
 back lanes and have little gardens in 
 the front.                            
 In Gordon Avenue the houses have      
 coloured glass porches and a footpath 
 betwen each house. There is an        
 entrance at the back.                 
 In West Avenue there are terra cotta  
 houses with iron vance round the      
 windows and these houses have back    
 gardens.                              
 The Woodbine Avenue houses are very   
 large and are used for flays, schools,
 surgeries and old people's homes.
