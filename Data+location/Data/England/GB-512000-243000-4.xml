		<content> In 1961 Ickwell won the 'Best Kept    
 Village' award. The village in fact   
 has no church or pub,the nearest      
 being in Northill. Once there used to 
 be a communal oven in the village     
 where the people took their Sunday    
 joint to be cooked and collect it on  
 their way home from church. This still
 stands by the green.                  
 In the last 84 years it has lost only 
 10 buildings which is not a bad       
 conservation record. Ickwell is now   
 one of Bedfordshire's numerous        
 conservation areas,therefore the      
 village is given the county's         
 protection. So Ickwell looks safe from
 the developers and Ickwell peach looks
 likely to survive. Visitors will      
 continue to visit and admire and enjoy
 a quiet Sunday afternoon watching the 
 cricket on the green.
