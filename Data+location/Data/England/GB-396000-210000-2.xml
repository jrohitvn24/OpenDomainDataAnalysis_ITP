		<title>02Elkstone's church.</title>
		<content> The church of St. John the Evangelist 
 is Elkstone's most significant        
 architectural feature, as it          
 incorporates many notable examples of 
 Norman work.                          
 The church has a carved tympanum above
 the south door which is said to be one
 of the best in the country. There are 
 several other examples of carved stone
 work on the building's exterior.      
 The tower was built in the            
 Perpendicular style and replaced the  
 Norman original which collapsed. The  
 tower walls are over 1 metre in       
 thickness and consist of hugh         
 freestone blocks of local limestone.  
 Within the tower is a set of 6 bells, 
 the oldest dating from 1657.          
 Next to the church is the Old Rectory 
 which has a Queen Anne front and a    
 tythe barn in its grounds.
