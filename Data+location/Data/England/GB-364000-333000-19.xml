		<title>19Council Houses</title>
		<content> Council housing was first developed in
 the inter war years.The first estate  
 at Alexandra Road Estate was completed
 between 1921 and 1923 and has been    
 recently renovated.The Oval estate was
 built in the early thirties and the   
 Kings Avenue estate followed in the   
 mid thirties.These again have been    
 modernised.The Dalelands estate was   
 first developed privately in the late 
 thirties.It was commandeered by the   
 Air Ministry and in the 1970s the     
 council purchased the estate.It was   
 extended in the immediate post war    
 years to Clifford Rd, Chestnut Rd and 
 Dalelands West.The most controversial 
 development was the Fairfields Estate.
 This open planned,terraced development
 of industrialised buildings has been  
 regularly criticised because of lack  
 of privacy and poor construction. The 
 gardens are now enclosed.             </content>
