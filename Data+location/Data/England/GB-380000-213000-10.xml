		<title>10The Severn Bore.</title>
		<content>  The Severn Bore is a big tidal wave. 
 As it moves past, smaller waves can be
 seen moving behind. The tide follows  
 it up the river towards Gloucester.   
 The current of the river can be seen  
 to reverse completely. The road nearby
 can be submerged within 45 minutes.   
  This phenomenon occurs as a result of
 the combination of tides and the shape
 of the estuary. There are about 200   
 Bores a year. The biggest tides (up to
 15m at Sharpness) are in March and    
 September at the equinoxes. These are 
 the best times for Bore watching.     
  What of the future? If proposals for 
 a Severn barrage come about, the      
 spectacle of the bore will be a thing 
 of the past. Local people who speak of
 "their" Bore with pride will not want 
 this to happen, and tourists will be  
 deprived of yet another landmark, or, 
 in this instance - tidemark.          </content>
