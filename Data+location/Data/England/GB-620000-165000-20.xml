		<content> At Marshside the only transport in the
 area is your own, for example: Car,   
 Motor Cycle, ect. The only main road  
 is the A229 Thanet Way. There are{no  
{buses or trains,}the nearest railway  
 station is at Herne Bay and it is 6   
 mile away. Marshside like most other  
 villages has its share of{O.A.P's}and 
 they have to be self sufficient. Just 
 about everyone who can afford a car   
 has one, but they also keep a bike no 
 matter who they are. Without a car if 
 you want to go shopping or travel by  
 train it will cost you Â£4.00 return by
 taxi. A heavy{fall of snow}can seal   
 the community in until local farmers  
 fix{snow ploughs}to their tractors. In
 summary, the transport facilities in  
 the area are very poor, perhaps the   
 worst in this end of Kent. However,   
 the area can at least boast an        
 airfield.                             </content>
