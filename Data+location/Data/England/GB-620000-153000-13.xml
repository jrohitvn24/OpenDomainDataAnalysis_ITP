		<title>13Adisham Area Special Homes</title>
		<content>  There is a privately run Home for    
twenty three old people at Bossington. 
It caters for the local area and some  
residents are sponsored by the County  
Council. The inmates cover a wide      
variety of social classes who mix well.
The Rector and Roman Catholic Priest   
from Aylesham visit the Home regularly.
A visitor comes two days a week to help
the residents with clay, art and craft 
work. There is a three monthly library 
delivery by the County and a range of  
papers and magazines provided.   Just  
above Adisham village is a privately   
run home for nine mentally handicapped 
people who live in family with the     
owners.  Some go out to work in local  
towns, while others remain at home.    
They attend Church and other village   
activities and are accepted in the     
community. Villagers are supportive of 
both Homes, visiting and helping.      </content>
