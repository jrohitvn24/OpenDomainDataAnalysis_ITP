{continued.}                           
                                       
 When I arrive home I go and change    
 into my old clothes.I take my dog out 
 and let him run after the rats that he
 can find,while I look at the calves.  
 Then  I go and see how the men are    
 getting on with the silage.When I have
 done all that I go in for my tea.     
                                       
 For my tea I normally have a stew.    
 After tea I go and feed the calves and
 help with the silage,I enjoy this     
 alot.I have to move the straw to their
 shed to make the calves' beds.We are  
 only on the first pile of silage ,we  
 normally have about three.I go indoors
 when I get  tired and watch television
 for a while and when I feel really    
 tired I go to bed.This is a typical   
 Thursday for me.                      </content>
