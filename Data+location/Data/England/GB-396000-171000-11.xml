		<title>11Maud Heath's Causeway,Wilts.</title>
		<content>   This Causeway begins at the top of  
 Wick Hill,four and a half miles from  
 Chippenham,goes down the hill to      
 Tytherton,crosses the disused Wilts   
 and Berks Canal,and crosses the River 
 Avon at Kellaways.It goes through     
 Langley Burrell, changes to a footpath
 along the Swindon Road,and ends by St.
 Paul's Church.When the railway was    
 made,an archway was built especially  
 for the causeway.                     
   In 1474,a lady called Maud Heath    
 left land and property in Chippenham  
 in the care of Trustees,to use the    
 income to build and maintain a raised 
 path so that people going to market   
 could avoid the usual mud.The Causeway
 is still in use.                      
   A tall Monument was built with an   
 effigy of Maud Heath on top,on Wick   
 Hill in 1698.
