		<title>12The Cross on the Hill.</title>
		<content>  Beside the river Darent is the{War   
{Memorial}.It directs you to look up at
 the hill where there is a{cross cut   
{into the chalk.                       
                                       
  If you walk through the village to   
 the Recreation Ground,take the        
 footpath to the Terrace and walk along
 it,then you will come to the cross.   
 From there you can look back down and 
 see{Shoreham village in the valley.   
                                       
  This landmark,which can be seen from 
 miles around,was made by the villagers
 of Shoreham{in memory of the soldiers 
{who were killed in the First World War
{(1914-1918)}.The cross measures 59m in
 length and 13m in width.              
                                       
  The sight of sheep and cattle grazing
 in the fields probably has not changed
 in hundreds of years.                 </content>
