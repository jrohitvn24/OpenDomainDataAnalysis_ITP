		<title>13RELIGION:THE GOSPEL HALL</title>
		<content>The little chapel was built at Great   
Wenham 50 years ago.At that time it    
consisted of a worship area with a     
small entrance partitioned off and one 
room at the back.There is a baptistry  
at the front of the worship area under 
the flooring.                          
In the early 1970's the chapel was     
improved by building cloakrooms and    
an entrance area.The worship area was  
enlarged to seat about 70..People      
attend from several of the surrounding 
villages.Congregations now often exceed
70 so land has been purchased in Capel 
and planning permission obtained to    
build a new church there.              
During the Easter holidays together    
with the parish church a holiday Bible 
club is run for children of the        
surrounding villages.Regular services  
are held on Sunday mornings and        
evenings and Sunday school at 9.45a.m. </content>
