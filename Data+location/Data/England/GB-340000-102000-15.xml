		<title>15TOURISM</title>
		<content> In our area we get quite a lot of     
 tourists.They are usually from cities 
 and have very differert accents.The   
 weather is very good in the summer and
 they go to beaches most often.The best
 ones are at Lyme Regis,West Bay and   
 Charmouth.Some are on bicycles and go 
 sight seeing,walking or picnics       
 etc.Lewsdon and Pilsdon are often     
 visited by walkers and cyclist.The odd
 couple may stay in a pub at night then
 go to beaches and other places like   
 that at day and come back at          
 night.They would have to stay in a    
 summer cottage if not a pub in our    
 area if they wanted to stay           
 here.Because there aren't any hotels.
