		<title>02TOURISM IN SOUTH DEVON</title>
		<content> In the summer the amount of traffic on
 the lanes of the South Hams increases 
 dramatically.Most of this is holiday  
 traffic,so we decided to ask visitors 
 about their trip here.We interviewed  
 people who stopped their cars at      
 Battisborough Cross.Our first question
 was,why had they stopped?Some had     
 stopped to go to the Post Office,some 
 to park their cars,but most had paused
 to ask the way or to consult a map!   
 None were actually visiting the Cross.
     The most popular destination was  
 Mothecombe Beach (about 1 mile away), 
 then Newton Ferrers and Noss Mayo     
 (picturesque villages on the Yealm    
 estuary,4 miles West),whilst some were
 just out for a drive.About half the   
 visitors were from the Plymouth       
 area,and the other half from          
 elsewhere.One car had come from       
                                       </content>
