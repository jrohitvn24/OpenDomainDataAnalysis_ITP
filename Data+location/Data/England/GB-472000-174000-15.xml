		<title>15Caversham Lock</title>
		<content>   The lock is one of the smallest on  
 the{River Thames}and this causes a    
 bottle_neck on busy Saturdays. You do 
 not have to pay to go through the lock
 as the price is included in your tax  
 to have the boat. It takes about 10   
 minutes to get through the lock. The  
 lock holds{135000 gallons}of water    
 when full and{73000 gallons}when      
 drained. The lock opens at{9.00 a.m.  
 all the year round and closes at{7.00 
{p.m. in the summer and 4.15 p.m. in   
{the winter.}The busiest time of year  
 is June to September but it usually   
 depends on the weather on how many    
 boats go through the lock. The lock   
 gates are operated by electricity.    
 Mainly pleasure boats go through the  
 lock. Most{foreign tourists}are from  
 America, Germany and Australia. Near  
 the lock is a shopping marina which   
 sells food, diesel fuel etc for boats.</content>
