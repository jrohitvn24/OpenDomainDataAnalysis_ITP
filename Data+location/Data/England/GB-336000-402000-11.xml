		<title>11Farming</title>
		<content> The size of farms is increasing due to
 economic pressures and a policy of    
 amalgamation is being pursued by large
 land owners.This is especially true of
 potatoe and carrot producers which use
 large scale mechanisation and a low   
 labour requirement.                   
 Some crops are grown on contract to   
 processers but the majority are       
 marketed through local produce        
 merchants.Many of the farms also have 
 their own farm shops for the general  
 public.                               
 Plant nurseries are also an important 
 feature in this area,each with its    
 outlets to the public.
