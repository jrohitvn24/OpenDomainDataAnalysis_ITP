		<content>  We have four churches in our area,and
 they are all Anglican.Brodsworth,Hoot_
 _on,and Hickleton are all pre_Norman  
 conquest,although the date of Marr is 
 dubious.At the present,there are two  
 priests in the area,Fr.G.M.Yould,who  
 serves Brodsworth,Marr,and Hooton,and 
 Fr.A.Parkinson,who is {priest}at      
 Hickleton.Saxon churches were usually 
 just a simple nave,but additions have 
 been built on through the centuries.A 
{church}of the Saxon era can be found  
 by looking for herringbone,a type of  
 stonework,which is viewed most clearly
 at Brodsworth.Brodsworth{church}and   
 Hickleton{church}both suffer from     
 mining subsidence,which is what caused
 the excavations to take place at      
 Hickleton.At every{church, worship}   
 takes place on a regular basis,with   
 services on Sundays and Midweek.And so
{religion}is well catered for.         </content>
