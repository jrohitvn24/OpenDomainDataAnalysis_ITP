 for{law and order}in the area of

 to work he has to                     
 look through his paperwork which      
 usually takes him about 1\ hours.     
    Then he goes out in his car. When  
 he is out of his office he can do what
 he likes.                             
    Sometimes he goes to pick up fines 
 or sorts out gun licences and tells   
 people when they are in court.        
   He deals with car crashes,          
 speeding cars, people without         
 seatbelts and drunken drivers.        
    He has to deal with stray          
 dogs and burglars. An important part  
 of his work is helping children.      </content>
