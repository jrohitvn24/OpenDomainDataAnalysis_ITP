		<content> In Hatton Heath,7 people are employed 
 at what was a petrol filling station, 
 to repair &amp; sell motor mowers.Also    
 sold are greenhouses &amp; garden sheds   
 now displayed on the old forecourt.   
 There is also a small firm,employing 2
 which buys secondhand light commercial
 pick-up trucks &amp; vans eg.Ford,Honda,  
 &amp; reconditions them for re-sale.There 
 is a motor engineer who will carry out
 servicing,repairs,respraying,welding &amp;
 fit exhausts as well as having a      
 breakdown truck.All of these rely on  
 their position on the A41 road for    
 trade but the kennels breeding cocker 
 spaniels advertises itself through    
 dog shows(a winning dog being of more 
 value).It is licenced to keep 20 dogs 
 for show but is not a boarding kennels
 &amp; is more of a lucrative hobby than a 
 job.A Saighton dairy farm does cater  
 for the holiday boarding of cats.     </content>
