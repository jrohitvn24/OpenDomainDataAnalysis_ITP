		<title>12LAND CHANGE IN MERSEY VALLEY</title>
		<content> On the Tithe Map of 1848 the land was 
 mostly fields but the bleach works    
 shown is still operating today.       
  The last 20 years have  seen dramatic
 changes.New housing estates and       
 industrial estates have sprung up to  
 almost cover the area.                
  More than 50 units make up the estate
 mostly light industry,Photo printing  
 light engineering and so on.          
  The other major change reflects      
   Transport Changes.The area was      
   bisected by three major Railway     
 lines from Stockport to Liverpool and 
 Manchester to London.All barring one  
 are now closed but a 3 line Motorway  
 the M63 runs right through the valley.
 The view across the valley would be   
 almost unrecognisable to a visitor    
 from 100 years ago.
