		<content>{SQUARE 3910}contains mainly Rye Park  
{Sewage Works}&amp; gravel pits. The latter
 have filled with water forming small  
 lakes used for sailing &amp; fishing      
{(RECREATION).}The many fields in the  
 area are put to grass; well fertilised
 from the sewage farm.                 
{TRANSPORT:}Ryegate Farm is served by a
 small track (soon to be cut by the    
 Stanstead Abbotts By-pass) just off a 
 minor road which is an access road for
 the heavy goods traffic to the sewage 
 farm &amp; gravel pits, but also acts as  
 an alternative route through          
 Hoddesdon.                            
 The county boundary with Essex cuts   
 across the SE corner &amp; a railway line 
 runs parallel on the Essex side, as   
 does the River Stort (with  lock). The
 gravel pits are still working with    
 conveyor belts taking the gravel to   
 the main sewage area.                 </content>
