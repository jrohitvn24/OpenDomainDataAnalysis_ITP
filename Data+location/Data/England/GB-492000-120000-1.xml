        Most of the block is cultivated
 farmland, pasture, woodland and  polo-
 grounds.Little of the area is taken up
 by buildings. The hamlet of{Selham}is 
 to the south of the Petworth to       
 Midhurst road,Halfway Bridge straddles
 it and the hamlet of{River}lies east  
 across the valley of the Lod from the 
 village of{LODSWORTH.}The narrow lanes
 inhibit through traffic; meet a       
 tractor or horsebox,a herd or flock   
 and you may need to squeeze into the  
 hedge.Woodland to the north,Petworth  
 Park to the east, downland views to   
 the south,Cowdray Park to the west,the
 village boasts many fine dwellings.   
 Recent council houses at Oakfield have
 enabled more people to live amidst its
 calm and serenity.
