		<title>20A friend in Patchway</title>
		<content>    My best friend is a boy who is only
 two years old. I first met him when he
 and his mum came to my house. I am    
 inviting him to my birthday party.    
   When he comes he plays with me and  
 my dog. he likes all my cars and is   
 often playing with them. His favourite
 colour is yellow and his favourite    
 book is a waterproof book about a     
 frog.                                 
   He is medium built and is about     
 normal height. His dad works and lives
 abroad.                               
   Once Daniel came on a visit to      
 Thornbury with me. His mum bought him 
 a toy dog. He is not allowed to have  
 army toys, because his mum does not   
 like war.
