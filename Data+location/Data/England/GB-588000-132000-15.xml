		<content> I like living in Tenterden because my 
 best friend called Ruth Bourne lives  
 there. I don't like Tenterden all that
 much. I used to live in Watchet and   
 that was better than here.  My dad    
 works all over Kent because he is a   
 Methodist minister and he preaches at 
 different churches and visits people. 
 My mum has not got a job but she helps
 in Homewood Lower School library      
 sometimes.                            
 When I am not at school, I watch      
 television, or go down town or go to  
 the rec. to play with my friends. I go
 to Brownies and the Homewood Music    
 Centre on Tuesdays. Sometimes I help  
 my mum in the kitchen. I think        
 Tenterden is quite a good place for   
 shopping, but it could be better.It   
 has quite good friendly people and the
 houses are nice.                      
 I used to live in Watchet in Somerset.</content>
