Longthworth is a medium sized village  
about 15 miles west of Oxford and set  
in a rural environment, a mile from the
main Oxford to Swindon road.           
 The village is a mixture of old houses
and cottages together with more modern 
council housing. The is an old Manor   
House and church. The village is       
mentioned in the original Domesday     
Book.                                  
 The land is high and flat with a steep
escarpment running down to the valley  
of the Thames. Most of the locality is 
used for arable farming with a small   
amount of market gardening.            
 Most of the inhabitants commute to    
work in Oxford, Abingdon or Faringdon, 
or are employed at the Atomic Energy   
Research Establishment at Harwell some 
12 miles from the village.
