		<content> Although much of the area is common   
 land there are large areas taken up   
 with the{Mental Hospitals}of West Park
 and The Manor.                        
                                       
 Farming is also very important with { 
{Rushett Farm} occupying some 800      
 acres.                                
                                       
 Large {housing estates}on the edges of
 Epsom and Ashtead grew up in the      
 1930's and 1940's to provide homes in 
 the country for London's{Commuters.}  
                                       
 Much of the {woodland}was used in the 
 past for shipbuilding but now the     
 demand has gone and the forrests have 
 been left to grow wild.  Some areas   
 are used for leisure with a large golf
 course to the north of Leatherhead.
