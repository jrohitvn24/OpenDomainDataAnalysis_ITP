		<title>11The Army at Middle Wallop.</title>
		<content> Middle Wallop camp and airfield       
 the Army Air Corps Centre was         
 originally built in 1939 as a Royal   
 Air Force station, and was a major    
 fighter station throughout the        
 1939-1945 war. It became a Naval air  
 station for one year but otherwise    
 remained Royal Air Force until 1957,  
 when the unit that trained Army pilots
 expanded and took over the whole      
 station. Since 1958 the station has   
 been entirely Army and, as the camp   
 has no barracks name, the title Army  
 Air Corps Centre serves for both. For 
 the period 1965 - 1973 the Centre was 
 entitled the Army Aviation Centre and 
 the training wings were grouped into  
 the School of Army Aviation, but the  
 present organisation dates from 1974.
