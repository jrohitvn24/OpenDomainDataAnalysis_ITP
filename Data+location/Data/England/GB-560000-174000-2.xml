		<content>         DARTFORD TUNNEL               
 The Dartford toll tunnel is the most  
 used tunnel in Britain.It is linked on
 to the M 25 or london orbital.There   
 are two Dartford tunnels one for going
 North and one for coming South.When   
 the M 25 is finished the tunnel and   
 its tolls will be the only thing      
 holding trafic up.There are plans for 
 a tunnel for heavy trafic only or     
 another tunnel each way.Boath to ease 
 the jamms.There is a waiting area for 
 trafic either of a large size that it 
 could be a nuisance or containing     
 dangerous goods such as petroleum     
 toxic chemicals and explosives.There  
 are two air funnels on each side of   
 the river.The funnels are silver and  
 are a sort of breathing apparatus for 
 the trafic inside the tunnel.As you   
 approach the Dartford tunnel you see  
 signs telling you to get in lane.     </content>
