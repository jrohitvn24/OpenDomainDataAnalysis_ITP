 known as{Jennyfields,}and {Grantley   
{Park.}

{Killinghall,}and in the north-east the
{River Nidd}winds its' way through the{
{Nidd Gorge}past the former Scotton    
 Mill, once one of 68 to be found in { 
{Nidderdale,}used for a variety of     
 tasks from grinding the local corn,   
 driving the machinery for the once    
 famous flax mills, and crushing the   
 lead ore mined from{Roman}days until  
 the beginning of this century.
