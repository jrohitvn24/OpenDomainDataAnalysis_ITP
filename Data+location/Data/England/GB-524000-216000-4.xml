		<title>04125th BIRTHDAY CELEBRATIONS</title>
		<content> On the{5th July 1985}we all came to   
 school dressed in{Victorian clothes.  
{The headteacher,Mr Jolly,}lined us up 
 in a line,boys in one line, girls in  
 another.When we got in to the class we
 sat in our two seater desks.          
 Mr Jolly called the register we lined 
 up and walked down to assembly where  
 we all received a certificate to say  
 we were here when the school was{125  
{years old}.After the assembly we stood
 outside the old building for          
 photographs to be taken. We returned  
 to class.We had lessons with Father   
 Robin and PC Mitchell, after that we  
 were given copy books for our writing.
 Then we did some subtraction.We had   
 broth for lunch.Later we found out    
 that the parents had layed on a       
 tea for us,and we received a leather  
 bookmark and then went home having    
 enjoyed our day.                      </content>
