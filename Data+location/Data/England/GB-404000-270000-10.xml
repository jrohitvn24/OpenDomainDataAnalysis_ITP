		<title>10Living In Rowney Green</title>
		<content> Many people chose to live in Rowney   
 Green because they liked the area.    
 Most people worked in Birmingham so   
 they liked to go home and relax after 
 a hards days work.  The village is set
 into open country-side.  Most of the  
 houses are large and expensive and    
 they all have large gardens except for
 two.  Some of the people were forced  
 to move because of their jobs.  Others
 came for a nice retirement in the     
 country.  The young people came with  
 their parents to live in the village. 
 One person moved there because the    
 houses were cheaper when he was       
 younger.
