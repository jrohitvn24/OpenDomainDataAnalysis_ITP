		<content>   The  new  path will cross a new foot
 bridge along the  bank. {Floods}in the
 past  have  caused   great {damage }at
 Chandos Park{Bowling }Green  and  Ford
 Meadow{Football}Ground.               
   In  the  old days  the  flooding was
 worse  because  before  the {bridge}at
 Bridge Street  there  was no other way
 to get to the weekly  market. So  when
 there  were {floods }it was {dangerous
 even at the Ford to try and get cattle
 across the river.                     
   Well Street  School and the Woolpack
 Inn are even nowdays under water quite
 often in Winter. And  the  grounds  of
 low  lying  {houses} has  often   been
{flooded.                              
   A panel  has been chosen by the AVDC
 to examine the smaller  details of the
 schemes.  Also  the  AWA  is  offering
 public meetings to  discuss  the{flood
{schemes.                              </content>
