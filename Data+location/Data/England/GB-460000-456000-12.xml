		<title>12THE GAME OF DARTS</title>
		<content>  At home I play darts, to play you    
 need: a dart board, 3 darts each, a   
 marker and a scoreboard.              
  I don't have a score board so we     
 score on paper.                       
  With my dad I play around the        
 dart board.You have to throw your     
 darts at number 1 then 2 and so on    
 until you get to 20, then it's        
 bullseye.                             
  With all the family we play a game of
 darts called Cricket,but it's always  
 me and my brother versus Mum and      
 Dad.My brother isn't very good at     
 getting wickets.You score runs by     
 throwing 3 darts which score over 25, 
 to get a wicket you have to throw for 
 the doubles on the board.             
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
