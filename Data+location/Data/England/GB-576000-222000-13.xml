		<content> Braintree's crossroads have been an   
 important landmark in the town's long 
 history . Even today they are part of 
 the town's one way system which       
 Channels a considerable volume of     
 traffic through Braintree. the Railway
 deals with the London commuter traffic
 which drives into Braintree and       
 through the rest of the day the roads 
 are busy. During a twenty minute      
 survey it was found that 466 cars     
 passed through Coggeshall Road        
 followed by 40 vans and 28 lorries.   
 The towns unusually named bus park is 
 a large terminous for eastern         
 national bus company and its green    
 buses are a constant feature on the   
 major roads. a one way system is      
 planned but has been for twenty years.
