 the rest,34% came from London,31% from
 areas in Essex,and 15% from the       
 Midlands and the South.Of the people  
 who moved to Rayleigh,29% moved       
 because of work,and 27% moved because 
 they married.of the 4% who have always
 lived here,50% have moved around,but  
 50% have stayed in the same house.    
    98% of the adult population like   
 living here for a variety of reasons, 
 including being near the country and  
 coast,and the distance from London.The
 other 2% dislike Rayleigh because of  
 the people and a lack of amenities.
