		<title>15SOCIAL SURVEY - POPULATION</title>
		<content> THE CONTEMPORARY RURAL POPULATION MAY 
 BE DESCRIBED AS SOCIALLY ADVANTAGED   
 INSOFAR AS THERE ARE STRONG BONDS     
 WHICH BIND THE COMMUNITIES AND PROVIDE
 A CERTAIN DEGREE OF STABILITY AND     
 SECURITY,SO THAT THE COMMON MALAISE OF
 "STRESS" MAY BE MINIMISED WITHIN A    
 CARING ENVIRONMENT.                   
 INHABITANTS OF THESE DORMITORY        
 VILLAGES ARE MAINLY MIDDLE CLASS (WITH
 AN INCREASING TENDENCY TOWARDS UPPER  
 MIDDLE CLASS - BECAUSE OF PROPERTY    
 PRICES), WITH A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF 
 ELDERLY WORKING CLASS - PARTICULARLY  
 IN CHAPEL BRAMPTON WHERE OLD ESTATE   
 WORKERS LIVE IN TIED PROPERTIES OWNED 
 BY THE ALTHORP ESTATES.               
 FEW YOUNG MARRIED COUPLES CAN AFFORD  
 TO SETTLE IN THE AREA, SO THAT THE    
 POPULATION IS LARGELY MIDDLE-AGED AND 
 ELDERLY. THERE ARE MANY WHO ARE 80    
 YEARS OLD OR MORE.                    </content>
