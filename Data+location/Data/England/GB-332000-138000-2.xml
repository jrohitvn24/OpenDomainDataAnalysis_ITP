		<content> Half of the population have lived in  
 the village for over ten years. There 
 had been some movement into the area  
 during the last year. People had      
 generally come to the village from    
 over fifty miles away.                
 The majority of households had up to  
 three people, one sixth being single. 
 There were children in half of the    
 houses, usually two. Their age varied 
 so some had to travel to comprehensive
 school.                               
 Half of the households had wage       
 earners, mainly working within ten    
 miles. Some were unemployed, a third  
 were retired.                         
 Hobbies were popular, gardening and   
 crafts most common. Half the          
 households had pets, usually dogs.    
 A third shopped locally. People also  
 tended to spend free time in the      
 village.                              </content>
