 Jeremiah and George Dixon are perhaps 
 the most famous people to have lived  
 in this area.George was born in 1731  
 and Jeremiah in 1733.Not much is known
 about their private lives.They were   
 probably born in Cockfield.Their      
 father was a servant on the Raby      
 Estates,where he was so highly thought
 of that his picture was hung in the   
 castle.It is known that the two       
 brothers lived for some time in Garden
 House,Cockfield,a building still      
 inhabited today.Their achievements    
 brought them world,wide fame,but      
 little is known  of the men           
 themselves.In 1977 an old stone trough
 was moved onto the Green at Cockfield 
 to form part of the Dixon Garden as a 
 project by local school children to   
 mark the Queens Silver Jubilee.
