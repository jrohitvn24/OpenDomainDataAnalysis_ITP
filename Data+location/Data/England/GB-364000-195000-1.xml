		<content>      The area around Bevington in     
 Gloucestershire consists mainly of    
 rough pasture land, much of which lies
 less than 10m above sea level.        
                                       
      From the North East to South west
 runs a slight ridge upon which most of
 the settlements are based.  This ridge
 rises to only 57m at it's highest     
 point.                                
                                       
      The largest single feature of    
 this block is Whitcliff Park - a deer 
 sanctuary belonging to Berkeley Castle
 just to the North of here.  The park  
 is not open to the public but can be  
 visited with prior permission.        
                                       
      The other park indicated on the  
 map is part of a private residence.
