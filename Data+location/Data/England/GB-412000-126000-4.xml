		<title>04RIDINGS MEAD , SALISBURY</title>
		<content> Ridings Mead is a new smart housing   
 estate. Houses range with bedrooms    
 from 1-4. There is a big house which  
 was part of an old peoples home called
 Meyrick Close. Each house has a       
 garden, but you don't know whether it 
 is a front or back garden, because    
 there is a path on each side of the   
 house. There are lots of short cuts &amp; 
 paths. Most of the houses have        
 garages. There are also sidewalks     
 going from one backroad to another.   
 There are street lights, a pillar box 
 &amp; two small playgrounds. The houses   
 are made of brick with concrete tiles.
 Most houses have fireplaces &amp; they all
 have gas &amp; electricty. The estate was 
 completed in 1985 on the site of The  
 Alderbury Union Workhouse. The chapel 
 is a free church but it used to be    
 the workhouse chapel.
