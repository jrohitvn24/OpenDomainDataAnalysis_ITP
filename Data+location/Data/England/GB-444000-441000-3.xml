		<title>03Industry in Tadcaster</title>
		<content>  Tadcaster has two main{industries,   
{brewing}and limestone{quarrying.}There
 are three breweries, Samuel Smith's,  
 (founded in 1768), John Smith's and   
 Bass Charrington's. Tadcaster is a    
 good place for making beer because it 
 has hard water, and other things      
 required such as sugar beet and barley
 are grown close by. In turn the       
 breweries help the{farmers}by         
 producing cattle cake. The beer which 
 is made is sent all over the country. 
 The stone taken from the quarries is  
 limestone and local quarries produced 
 the stone of which York Minster is    
 built. There are three quarries       
 currently working to produce building 
 stone and roadstone.                  
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
