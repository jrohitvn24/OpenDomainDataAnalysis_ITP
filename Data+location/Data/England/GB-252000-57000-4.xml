		<title>04     TRANSPORT SURVEY</title>
		<content>   There are a lot of cars on the      
 housing estates.We surveyed one       
 hundred households to obtain the      
 following information.                
   Eight per cent of house holds had no
 cars,sixty per cent had one car and   
 thirty two per cent had two or more   
 cars.Ten per cent of people had cars  
 under one year old. Twenty per cent   
 had cars less than two years old.Sixty
 per cent of people had cars less than 
 five years old.There were only two    
 cars over thirteen years old.         
   Only twenty five per cent of people 
 surveyed use public transport.Over    
 sixty two per cent of households have 
 more than one person in employment.   
 This may explain why most people have 
 more than one car.                    
   Three of the eight people who have  
 no car are retiried.
