		<title>02 WOODROFFE SQUARE - CALNE</title>
		<content> I live in Woodroffe Square in Calne.  
 Opposite me some private builders have
 just finished 6 new houses. Straight  
 up Prince Charles Drive they have     
 built a new bit to the estate it's    
 called Grosvenor Park. My friend lives
 there. Before the six new houses were 
 built I helped the two bricklayers    
 carry bricks. I like helping builders 
 with bricks and other jobs because it 
 is fun. Sometimes a man came with a   
 JVC digger and dug trenches. He gave  
 me rides in the bucket of his digger. 
 He told me he worked on a golf        
 course.He found lots of golf balls, he
 gave me some. Years ago the school    
 caretaker's house was a pond and my   
 row of houses was a field.They are    
 building lots of new houses in Calne. 
 I live by the school and there is a   
 park not far away. My house is eleven 
 years old.                            </content>
