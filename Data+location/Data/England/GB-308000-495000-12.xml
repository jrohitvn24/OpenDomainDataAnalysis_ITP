 Ltd.runs its narrow-gauge(15")trains  
 7 miles up Eskdale to Boot station    
 stopping at Muncaster Mill,Irton Rd.  
 and Green Road every working day.From 
 March to November the open and covered
 carriages are pulled by the steam     
 locomotives River Mite,River Esk River
 Irt,Synolda,Northern Rock and Bonnie  
 Dundee.Diesel engines,Quarryman Silver
 Jubilee,Shelagh of Eskdale,Perkins and
 Lady Wakefield, pull extra trains if  
 necessary and run the winter service. 
 Most of the line is single track and  
 there is a unique 'walkie-talkie'     
 system to stop two trains being on the
 same piece of track at the same time.6
 of the 7 miles of track have been     
 replaced since 1970 when the present  
 company bought the railway at auction.
 1985 was a good year,125000 people    
 made 190000 journeys.                 </content>
