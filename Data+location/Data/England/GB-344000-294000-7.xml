		<title>07CHURCHES IN ALL STRETTON</title>
		<content>    St Michael and All Angels church   
 was built of stone in{1902.}The stone 
 came from Batch valley quarry. At the 
 bottom of the path leading up to the  
 church there is a wooden{lych gate.}  
    One of the most beautiful things in
 the church is{the kneelers.}These     
 were made by the ladies of the church.
 They all have different pictures of   
 nature embroidered on them.           
    There are some{unusual windows}in  
 memory of a local doctor. They were   
 engraved by John Hutton who also did  
 the windows in Coventry Cathedral.    
    Recently the United Reformed Church
 was sold and converted into a house.  
 The vestry in St Michael's church has 
 been made into a small chapel for the 
 URC to use instead. This arrangement  
 seems to work very well and sometimes 
 they have{combined services. }
