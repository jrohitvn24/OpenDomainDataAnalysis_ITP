		<title>13The River Dee.</title>
		<content>   The main river in Dentdale is the   
 River Dee which runs into the River   
 Lune a famous salmon river.Dentdale's 
 River Dee is about 15 miles long, and 
 about 20 foot at its widest point,it  
 is very deep in places especially     
 after a storm,the current can be very 
 strong, people have been swept away   
 and killed because of it.Many         
 waterfalls and caves are to be found  
 along this river,at one point it falls
 into a deep pool and a cave called    
 Ibbeth Peril,this is so called because
 it is presumed a witch called         
 Elizabeth lived there;she is now      
  buried under the church gates.       
      It is possible to canoe down the 
 river even negotiating the weir at    
 Rash Mill.People swim in the river and
 fish for trout,eels and salmon.In the 
 summer of 1984 the river almost dried 
 up,there was still water in the caves.</content>
