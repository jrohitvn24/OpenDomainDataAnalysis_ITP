		<content>  Jack Scout, which probably means     
 oaktree cliff, was acquired by the    
 National Trust in 1982. The money was 
 raised by an enthusiastic local       
 committee and a grant from Enterprise 
 Neptune.                              
  It is a pleasant, wild, rocky area on
 cliffs overlooking the sea on the     
 eastern verge of Morecambe Bay. The   
 walls and an old limekiln were        
 repaired during these years by the    
 National Trust with the help of the   
 Manpower Services Commission. Many men
 and boys learned dry stone walling    
 techniques and some have since set up 
 in business on their own. The area is 
 used mainly for walking and is let to 
 a farmer, who keeps it grazed as there
 are a number of rare plants which     
 thrive in short turf. Paths pass      
 through the gorse used by small birds 
 as nesting sites.                     </content>
