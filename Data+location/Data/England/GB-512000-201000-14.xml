		<content>Most of the  house building dates from 
after 1950, although there was a little
before then.                           
Most of the homes are owned by the     
families that live in them.They vary   
from small bungalows to large          
four-bedroomed houses.Many of the      
buldings are detached,with spacious    
gardens.The asking price for a         
four-bedroomed house or bungalow is    
about one hundred thousand pounds, as  
the area is considered a pleasant one, 
and it is very well-placed to travel by
road, using the M 1, and M 25, when it 
is finished.
