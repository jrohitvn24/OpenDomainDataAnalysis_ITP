		<title>01Heybridge and the Area</title>
		<content>    Heybridge and Maldon are places    
 with backgrounds that stretch far back
 into history. The importance of Maldon
 is illustrated in the ancient poem    
 'The Battle of Maldon', and there is  
 evidence that before the river on     
 which it once stood silted up, that   
 Heybridge was a thriving port as long 
 ago as 400 B.C.                       
    In the Domesday Book Heybridge (or 
 Tidwolditun as it was then known) is  
 recorded as being a farming community 
 and today Maldon is still a small     
 market town. The fields around abound 
 with cereal crops and flour milling is
 still carried on today. Similarly boat
 building and salt refining continue.  
    However, the area also has its     
 share of heavy and light engineering  
 and the service industries are        
 increasing. An area with a past but   
 also a future.                        </content>
