<title>23Our Village of Timsbury</title>
<content>

On top of 2 tree hill a long, tall tree stands guarding Timsbury. It has a close beady eye which makes some people think it is 2 trees. It has just grown in a very funny way. The main villages around Timsbury are Camerton , Tunley , Farmbourgh and Paulton . There is a big Georgian city close by called Bath where there are lots of shops that have recently been built, it is also quite easy to get to London and Cardiff by train from Bath.   Keynsham is the next nearest town. The largest city to Timsbury is Bristol.   &lt;br />
