		<content> This block is an uninhabited area of  
 coniferous woodland, owned by the     
 Forestry Commission. The Suffolk/     
 Norfolk County border passes through  
 in a large curve and in the S.E.      
 corner there is a piece of Danger Area
 (M.O.D.) attached to a firing range   
 in the next block.The S.W. corner has 
 0.5 mile stretch of the B1106 and the 
 N.E. corner has 0.5 mile of the B1107.
 Details of the ecology and the        
 Forestry Commission are as for block  
 0580 0285 except for one addition. In 
 the extreme east is a small strip of  
 old heathland which is protected for  
 the lichens and mosses, and in the    
 woods behind is the ruin of a Hunting 
 Lodge in the care of English Heritage.
