    THESE ARE THE RULES FOR BRITISH    
 BULLDOG.FIRST OF ALL YOU LINE UP AT   
 ONE END OF THE PLAYGROUND AND THERE IS
 SOMEBODY ELSE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE    
 PLAYGROUND WHO IS "IT".THE PERSON WHO 
 IS IT CALLS A PERSON FROM THE LINE AND
 THAT PERSON HAS TO DODGE THE PERSON   
 WHO IS "IT". IF HE GETS TO THE END HE 
 GIVES THE WORD FOR THE REST TO FOLLOW 
 HIM TO THE END OF THE PLAYGROUND. IF  
 ONE OF THEM IS CAUGHT HE HELPS "IT",  
 AND CHOOSES A DIFFERENT PERSON TO RUN.
 WHEN THE CATCHER CATCHES SOMEONE HE   
 SAYS "BRITISH BULLDOG ONE TWO THREE". 
 THE LAST TO BE CAUGHT IS "IT" FOR THE 
 NEXT GAME.
