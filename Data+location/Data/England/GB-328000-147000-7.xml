		<title>07OUR NEW SEA DEFENCES</title>
		<content>  In 1982 we had a bad flood in Burnham
 when a combination of a very high tide
 and a strong west wind broke through  
 the sea wall and caused a lot of      
 damage. Our council decided that we   
 needed a new sea wall which was begun 
 in March 1984.                        
                                       
  45 people are working on the wall    
 altogether, and it is going to cost   
 Â£6,000,000.                           
                                       
  30,000 tonnes of concrete will go    
 into the wall which has a series of   
 steps from the beach and a high curved
 top to throw the waves back when the  
 tide is high. There is an interesting 
 pattern on the landward side of the   
 wall which makes it more attractive   
 for our visitors. The new wall will be
 higher than the old one, but we should
 still be able to see over it.         </content>
