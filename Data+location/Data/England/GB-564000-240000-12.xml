{Protected Lane}which ranks it among   
 the best in the country and therefore 
 of national importance. The name      
{Bumpstead}is thought to mean "the     
 place where the rushes or reeds grow" 
 and{Helions}comes from the place of   
 origin-{Hellean in Brittany-}of the   
 Domesday holder of the manor of       
 Helions. Helions Farm and Wiggens farm
 are{moated farms.}The{population}for  
 Helions bumpstead in 1961 was 366 and 
 in 1971 the population was 364.There  
 is very little{employment}in Helions  
 so some people go to Haverhill and    
 some travel to London to work.{School 
 children go to Steeple Bumpstead C.P. 
 School and then to Sible Hedingham    
 Comprehensive. Over 60% of people own 
 their own car.The Village has a W.I., 
 an elderly persons club and a mothers 
 and toddlers group.                   </content>
