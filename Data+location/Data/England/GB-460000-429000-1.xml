		<content> The area is to the South and East of  
 the market town of{Selby,}and includes
 the Eastern half of{Brayton}village.  
 The land is very flat rising to a     
 height of only 8m. 1/3 is residential,
 a mixture of private and council      
 housing, and 2/3 agricultural, mainly 
 arable land, with some grazing of beef
 cattle. Crops are mainly{barley,      
{wheat, sugar beet, potatoes, peas &amp;   
{rape.}The country landscape contains  
 few trees in small woods, few         
 hedgerows and large fields. Most      
 of the housing is semi-detached and   
 much of it built since 1960. The      
 Abbot's Road area is largely Council  
 housing. The major employers are Rigid
 Paper Products, Middlebrook Mushrooms,
 Yorkshire Chemicals, Sturge's         
 Chemicals and Selby District Council.
