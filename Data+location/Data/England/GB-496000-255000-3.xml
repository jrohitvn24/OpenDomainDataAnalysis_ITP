		<title>03FELMERSHAM</title>
		<content> The village of {Felmersham}grew up to 
 the south of one of the many crossing 
 points of the River Great Ouse. There 
 was a settlement here in Saxon times  
 and it is mentioned in the Domesday   
 Book. The most distinctive building in
 the village is the church, built on a 
 rise overlooking the river and bridge.
                                       
 The building is Early English in style
 and exceptionally impressive. Much of 
 the work dates from the 15th century  
 including the screen.                 
                                       
 Close to the church is the Tithe Barn,
 restored a few years ago and this     
 faces the village green, now a feature
 of the area having also been restored.
