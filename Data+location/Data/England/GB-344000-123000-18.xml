		<title>18Our Environment</title>
		<content> Our landscape varies from old marsh   
 land to around 5Oft above sea-level.  
 The soil is mainly heavy to clay-like,
 with some patches of peat.  The rises 
 are seldom gentle, and walkers soon   
 realize that the area is anything but 
 level. Much of our area is subject to 
 Listing and Conservation Orders. Enc- 
 losures and hedging were started in   
 l8OO, and are still very much in evi- 
 dence. Wild roses, honeysuckle and    
 blackberries still thrust their way   
 through the elder, hawthorn and may.  
 The Dutch Elms have succumbed to dis- 
 ease, and withies to the levelling    
 work. Copsing and replanting are being
 done, and a great deal of hardwood is 
 now rooting down. Flag iris, valerian,
 comfrey, ragged robin, and sedges are 
 common. Recent cuts in spraying have  
 encouraged the old wild flowers and   
 new plantings of hardwood.            </content>
