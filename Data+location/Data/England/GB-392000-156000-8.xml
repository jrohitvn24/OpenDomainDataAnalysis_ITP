		<content> The block contains two shops; both are
 Post Offices. In Bulkington only      
 sweets and cigarettes are sold; Keevil
 has grocery items.Gwen and Max Propert
 have run the business since Gwen began
 a PO and stores at 78 Main Street in  
 l940. In 1959 they moved to the old   
 Rose &amp; Crown pub, their present prem- 
 ises, and became the only shop in the 
 area with an off-licence.Until the 60s
 Keevil also sustained another shop,   
 begun in 1925 as a PO in the present  
 Old Bakery. This past trade has dim-  
 inished to loyal skeleton support for 
 the remaining shop. Mobile trade serv-
 ing the villages includes a fish and  
 chip van, fresh fish van, hairdresser 
 and shop. There is a small-scale sale 
 of goods under party-plan schemes and 
 by an Avon make-up agent. Bulkington  
 Ushers pub formerly The Bell, renamed 
 Well Inn caters mainly for local trade</content>
