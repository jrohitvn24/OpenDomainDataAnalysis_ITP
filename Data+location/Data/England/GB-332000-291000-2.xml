		<content> Ceilidhs are a popular{entertainment  
 with folk singing and barn dances and 
 often a buffet type supper dance.     
 Travelling theatre groups eg. Pentabus
 perform in village halls.  Bingo is   
 also popular.  Entertainment for young
 people tends to be in pubs rather than
 in public halls.  We have a few punks 
 - young people with studded jackets,  
 tight bleached trousers and spiky     
 coloured hair styles. {Shoes}vary in  
 style with wellingtons and strong     
 boots being the most popular footwear 
 for farm workers in the area. {Cost   
 from{Â£6-Â£15}for man made materials to 
{Â£20-Â£80}for leather footwear.  This   
 summer casual shoes for both sexes    
 made from brightly coloured canvas.   
 Jelly beans - Sandal type shoes made  
 from plastic are popular and cheap at 
{Â£2-Â£3}a pair.
