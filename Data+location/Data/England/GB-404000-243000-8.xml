 One of my hobbies is collecting       
 rubbers or pencil erasers.  They come 
 in all shapes and sizes and sometimes 
 they smell just like the objects they 
 are supposed to be.  I have been      
 collecting rubbers for nearly a year  
 and I have got 85 altogether.         
 When I was small I used to play games 
 like 'Orange Balls' which is where a  
 group of children stand in a circle   
 holding hands.  Then they skip round  
 singing.  The last to sit down is out 
 and so on.  The words they sing       
 are:Orange Balls, Orange Balls, Here  
 we go again, The last one to sit down 
 is out. Another game I played when I  
 was smaller was called 'Mr. Wolf.'    
 When you play Mr. Wolf one person is  
 on and you stand far away from him or 
 her and you have to say "What's the   
 time Mr. Wolf?"                       </content>
