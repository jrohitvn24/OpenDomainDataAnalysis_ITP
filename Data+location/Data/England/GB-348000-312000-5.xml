		<content> In the Square you will find the       
{Tourist Information Centre}which seeks
 to advise tourists on local amenities.
 The staff at the centre answer many   
 questions but the two most popular    
 requests are for a town map and       
 accommodation details. Sites that     
 tourists most wanted to see are the   
{Tudor buildings,}the{Abbey}and the    
{Castle.}In Pride Hill there is the    
{Citizens Advice Bureaux.}It handles   
 13,000 enquires per year.The most     
 common problem would appear to be     
 those related to the purchasing of    
 goods.{Shrewsbury's Library}stands in 
 Castle Foregate.The library has two   
 sections a lending and a local studies
 section.The lending section has 60,000
 books mainly fiction but a lot are    
 information books.The other section is
 used by many tourists to trace their  
 family trees.                         </content>
