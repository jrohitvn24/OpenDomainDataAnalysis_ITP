		<content>   To the East of Waterford Marsh      
 lies Great Molewood.  This is a       
 popular walking area for people living
 in the Molewood Estate.               
 The wood contains an interesting      
 collection of flora and fauna. Over   
 two dozen species of bird have been   
 observed here.  Muntjac deer are      
 quite common.                         
    On the northern edge of the wood   
 the Redland Gravel Company has        
 greatly increased its gravel          
 extraction during the last two or     
 three years. Two years ago local      
 residents successfully opposed an     
 application for planning permission to
 build houses on the site of the       
 disused gravel pit behind Cowper      
 Crescent.                             
 Great Molewood seems to be under      
 threat.                               
                                       </content>
