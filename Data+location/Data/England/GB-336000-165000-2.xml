		<content> The whole area of the parishes of Wick
 St. Lawrence and Kingston Seymour is  
 flat and low-lying. The level of the  
 land varies from 30 feet above to 30  
 feet below sea level.                 
 The fields are small and bounded by   
 mixed hedges.  The trees and bushes   
 which make up these hedges are        
 hawthorn, blackthorn,elderberry,willow
 and blackberry. Most of the elm trees 
 disappeared in an epidemic of Dutch   
 Elm Disease during the 1970's, which  
 greatly altered the skyline and meant 
 the loss of many trees. The roadsides 
 and fields are bounded by drainage    
 ditches known as rhines, which        
 remove the surface water.  The        
 farmhouses, mostly built in the 18th  
 and 19th centuries are strung out     
 along the roads surrounded by their   
 own land. A few houses cluster round  
 the church to form the village centres</content>
