		<content> The{population}of this area has       
 changed greatly over the last         
 twenty-five years with a gradual      
{influx}of people from other           
 counties, especially London and       
 the Home Counties.                    
 The family which is born and bred in  
 this locality is a rarity these days  
 as are familiar faces that one used to
 recognise and converse with every     
 day.                                  
 The{changing}population is steadily on
 the increase with new houses being    
 built on a small scale,varied types of
 employment plays a part in this       
 structure.                            
 The{traditional}inhabitants are       
 adversed to movement and change even  
 to the extent of taking their holidays
 on the Norfolk coast.
