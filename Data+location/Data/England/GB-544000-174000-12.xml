		<content> Eastcote Primary School was built in  
 1935,and serves its immediate         
 neighbourhood and almost all its 180  
 pupils live within walking            
 distance.The pupils aged 5_11 years   
 are grouped into 7 classes by age.The 
 purpose of primary education is to    
 learn the basic skills of             
 reading,writing and number in that    
 order to understand our world and     
 prepare for secondary school and adult
 life.                                 
 We consider that learning to get on   
 with people,art,craft,and physical    
 activities will be useful later on.   
 We are helped by a paid team of       
 adults_                               
 teachers,secretary,caretaker,cleaners,
 kitchen staff.Some parents help       
 out.Social workers and school         
 inspectors visit regularly.
