		<title>03Footpaths</title>
		<content>    The footpaths in our area are so   
 various that they cannot all be named.
 Many of them are through beautiful    
 areas of nature. Some of them are     
 having problems because of vandals    
 and are needing repair. Also the      
 amount of people going through these  
 paths make it very muddy and hard to  
 walk through. Farmers are a major     
 problem. They do not like the idea of 
 footpaths going through their fields  
 reducing their land crops. Some of the
 farmers plough up the paths. In the   
 Aston Clinton area a farmer had the   
 nerve to plough up the path in his    
 field but fortunately he was fined for
 it at a sum of Â£620.                  
     Many people hope it will soon be  
 against the law for people to do      
 this.
