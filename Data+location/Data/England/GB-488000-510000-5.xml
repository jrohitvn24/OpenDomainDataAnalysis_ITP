		<title>05The Whitby Gazette.</title>
		<content>  The{Whitby Gazette,}founded by the   
 Horne family in 1854, is Whitby's only
 local newspaper.Mr. Les Heath has been
 the editor since 1978 when{Scarborough
{&amp; District Newspapers}took over.      
  A major change by the new owners was 
 to make the paper a tabloid.Its       
 previous size was twice the area, but 
 had only half the pages.(The original 
 Gazette, no bigger than an A4 sheet,  
 had 16 pages and cost one old penny.) 
  Today's weekly circulation is        
 13,500.It is filled with information  
 gathered by reporters, locals and the 
 emergency services.The Gazette's      
 staff start printing on a Thursday at 
 5.30 p.m. and the paper is ready for  
 sale that evening.                    
  The editor said that the crashing of 
 a Phantom Jet in an outlying village  
 was one of the most interesting       
 articles he had covered.              </content>
