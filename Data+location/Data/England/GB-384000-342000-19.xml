		<title>19Religion in Stoke</title>
		<content>We counted eight churches around our   
area.Some were large stone buildings.  
They had graveyards by the side.Other  
churches were by the houses.One of the 
churches,Stoke Baptist Church,is       
beginning to fall down.The church      
people have bought our old First school
and made it in the new Stoke Baptist   
church.                                
  Some children in our school are      
Muslims and they go to a Mosque.There  
isn't a Mosque near to where they live 
so they have to go to Shelton.The      
Muslims wear brightly coloured clothes 
especially when they are celebrating   
festivals.Our school is a C.E. school  
but we all do R.E. together and have   
assemblies together.It's fun learning  
about different religions.
