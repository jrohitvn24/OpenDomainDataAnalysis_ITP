{An Interview with Mr. Heffernan.      
 We spoke to mr. Heffernan about his   
 job as  caretaker. He likes working at
 the school and starts at 6.50 a.m. He 
 works here 7 hours a day. The first   
 place he checks is the boiler room:   
 the school has oil fired heating.     
 Mondays and Fridays are his busiest   
 days. In between jobs he chats to Mrs.
 Churchill. He has to check fuses, mend
 doors and windows, clean cupboards and
 stores. He has to clean the classes   
 and corridors and lock everything when
 school is over for the day.           </content>
