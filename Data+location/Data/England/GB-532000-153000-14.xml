		<content>  {THE DENE HOSPITAL}is built on the   
 corner of Waller Lane and Church Road.
 Before it became a hospital it was a  
 school. In the 1970's they proposed to
 close the hospital. Soon an action    
 group called{FRIENDS OF THE DENE}     
 decided to raise money to keep the    
 Dene open. The money was raised by    
 concerts, marathon runs, donations    
 etc.                                  
                                       
   Now the old building is a geriatric 
 hospital. The new building is a       
 psychiatric unit and a physiotherapy  
 department, both open daily.          
                                       
   They used to hold an annual firework
 display in a field next to the Dene.  
 They can't any more as they have built
 the new buildings on the field.
