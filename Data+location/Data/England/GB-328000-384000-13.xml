		<title>13PRENTON HALL</title>
		<content>{  Prenton Hall}appears in the Domesday
 Book as{Prestune,}meaning "dwelling of
 a priest". The existing building dates
 from the 16th century. The present    
 owners, who are interested in its     
 history, are helping local historians 
 to uncover its past. It stands on the 
 corner of the Roman Road, an old pack 
 horse trail which may have been built 
 by the Romans.                        
   In 1961 a visitor at the Hall saw   
 the{ghost of a monk}watching over her 
 in the lounge. There is{an old rhyme: 
    "When gorse is in blossom and holly
 is green, the{Prenton Hall buggon}will
 then be seen".                        
   The Hall is split into two, one half
 is being made into flats. It used to  
 be surrounded by 624 acres of land    
 which have since been sold. The back  
 of the Hall is now the front because  
 of the modern houses on 3 sides of it.</content>
