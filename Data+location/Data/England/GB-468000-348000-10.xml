		<content>   The only employer of any size in the
 block is the{Boots' Company}who employ
 an estimated 40 at their animal       
 research station in and around the{   
{Priory}house at{Thurgarton.}There,    
{drugs}are{tested}to ensure they are   
 safe for human use. They use mice,rats
 rabbits,dogs and marmosets.           
   In recent years they have built a   
 large,functional,unaesthetic building 
 like a plastic hanger.Clearly the     
 operation has a long term future.     
   Fisons (ex-Boots) test chemicals on 
 a good-sized fruit farm:mainly apples.
   At the{Woodyard}in{Bleasby}a couple 
 of men saw up trees for pallets and   
 pit props as well as supplying quality
 trees to the furniture industry.      
   There is a two-man building firm.The
 only other jobs are domestic helpers, 
 gardeners,and servers in the two shops
 and the three public houses.          </content>
