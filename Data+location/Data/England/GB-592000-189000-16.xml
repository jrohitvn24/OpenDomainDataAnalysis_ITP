		<title>16TRAFFIC SURVEY</title>
		<content> In our village we carried out a       
 traffic survey to see how many        
 vehicles go by in a day. We started at
 8am and finished at 5pm. There were   
 350 lorries, 580 cars,16 buses and    
 coaches, 199 motor bikes and          
 bikes but only 7 tractors. The        
 reason why there are so many lorries  
 is because they go to the pit. Some   
 carry rubbish, some sand, some cement 
 from the ready mix depot. Many of the 
 cars bring children to and from       
 school. The busiest times are         
 between  9am and 10am. The least      
 busy time was between 10am  and 11am.
