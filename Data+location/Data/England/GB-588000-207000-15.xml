		<title>15GOLDHANGER - HEAD STREET</title>
		<content>      We do not know why it is called  
 Head Street,but I think it is because 
 when the ploughs turned round at the  
 head of the field a strip of land was 
 left,which became a pathway.On the    
 left of the road there is a bus       
 shelter which is in memory of         
 King Goerge VI and built about 1960.  
 On the other side there is similar bus
 shelter. On the right there is a house
 called"Wheelwrights" which used to be 
 the site of a wheel maker. Further up 
 there is a builders house, it is      
 called Sunnyside house.The first      
 house on the right used to be a post  
 office and shop but now it is a       
 private house. One knows it was a shop
 because the window is big and oblong  
 like a toy shop window.In Head street 
 there is a half timbered house.It has 
 a white door and typical black beams  
 on the front,with plaster fillings.   </content>
