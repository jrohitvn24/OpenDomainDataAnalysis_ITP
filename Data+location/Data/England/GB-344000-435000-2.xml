		<content>    Catforth is a small village that   
 forms part of the parish of           
 Woodplumpton. There is a small village
 centre but many of the houses are     
 spread out along long, winding lanes. 
 There are several hamlets within the  
 Catforth Ward such as Lewth and       
 Swillbrook, although these lie just   
 outside the area being studied.       
    Catforth is characterised by its   
 large proportion of farms and         
 businesses, both big and small. There 
 are several dairies and milk rounds,  
 also builders, joiners, haulage       
 contractors and suchlike. Many small  
 farms also sell milk, eggs and        
 vegetables to those who want them.    
 PDC Fuels,an oil depot, now stands on 
 the site of what was once a village   
 dance hall.
