		<title>03Customs in Chalton</title>
		<content>{Weather Sayings:}When storm clouds    
 approach from the South,Chalton people
 say: "It's raining from  William's    
 mother. "This might be a reference to 
 the mother of William the Conqueror.  
 She lived in Normandy.                
{SUPERSTITIONS:}If you see a magpie you
 should spit over your finger to avert 
 bad luck.{SUPERNATURAL:}There are five
 stories. One says a horesman rides on 
 Chalton Down.Another tells of a hunter
 who chased a white fox into a house by
 the Red Lion. The hunter found no fox 
 but a  fair  haired  woman  breathing 
 heavily. Another tells of an invisible
 hand  sweeping  objects  off  the     
 mantelpiece at Chalton Priory. At the 
 same time,a picture fell off the wall.
 The wires holding it  up   appeared to
 have been cut. At  the  Priory dinner 
 party, a guest mistook a figure in a  
 nun's habit for a maid.               </content>
