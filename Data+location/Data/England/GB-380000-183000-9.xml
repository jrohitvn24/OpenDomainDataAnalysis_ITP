		<title>09LUCKLEY FARM.</title>
		<content> Luckley Farm has 365 acres. The farm  
 used to be a dairy farm until 1968.The
 farm is now mainly arable and rough   
 grazing.The main crops are            
 wheat,barley and oats otherwise the   
 fields are used for grazing their     
 sheep, cattle and their horses (34    
 sheep,1 ram, 40 beef cattle, 6        
 horses.)A few of the horses are used  
 for racing.The largest field is 32    
 acres, the smallest 4 acres.The farm  
 is managed by one family and their    
 relations.The land and building are   
 owned by the Duke of Beaufort.        
 This year's harvest has been poor     
 because of heavy rainfall.The most    
 recent project has been to empty and  
 clean their reservoir. This reservoir 
 was once the water supply to Badminton
 House.Luckley Farmland now produces   
 more crops per acre; one acre is      
 always kept for the family garden.    </content>
