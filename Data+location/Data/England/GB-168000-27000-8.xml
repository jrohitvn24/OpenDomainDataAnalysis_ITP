 Mr Keat has a computer business called
 Chemdata.He makes programs and it     
 takes about three years to make a big 
 program and 1\ weeks to make a small  
 program.He's been in the business for 
 one year now and sends his programs   
 to universities and coleges all over  
 the country.He only has one computer  
 at the moment but he is trying to     
 buy another.                          
 He draws graphics on the screen of the
 computer,they represent molecules and 
 atoms.He is a different chemist to the
 ones when you go into a shop and get  
 medicines.Mr Keat is not a computer   
 programer he researches into          
 chemistry.Mr Keat used a computer     
 about 1980 which is five years ago.Mr 
 Keat gets bored with his computer.{
