		<title>09MELBREAK HUNT, LOWESWATER</title>
		<content> We all like to hear songs of hunting, 
 Of hunters and hounds that are gone,  
 &amp; we're all very proud of the history 
 The la'al Melbreak pack's built upon. 
 Since first it kicked off with John   
 Benson, That master so true &amp; so grand
 It always has ranked amongst foxhounds
 As one of the best in the land.       
 So lets sing good luck to laal M'break
 We've followed them many a mile.      
 For there's one day each year we all  
 love to be there,                     
 It's New Year's Day hunt at Kirkstile.
 From the Park we have shifted the     
 kennels, To just under Hobcarton Crag 
 Where t'laal foxhounds vow death unto 
 foxes, As soon as their laal tails can
 wag. Our huntsman today understands em
 He wears a flash waistcoat of red.    
 But go where you can you'll find no   
 other man       Take more pride in his
 hounds than Dick Head.                </content>
