		<title>18Broughton Castle:Banbury (2)</title>
		<content> The Castle has been in the {Saye and  
Sele family} since 1370.               
 There have been {21 Saye and Seles}.  
There was a man called Saye who came   
over from France in the middle ages.   
Most people came from France and he    
settled in Kent and he was a rich and  
 mportant man. King Henry V1 made him  
Baron in 1447. He lived in a place     
called Sele in Kent he added Sele onto 
his name to make Saye and Sele.        
 Every year Broughton Castle has about 
{18000 visitors}. One of the most      
famous people to visit was the {Crown  
Prince of Japan} with his wife and     
family. The Castle has needed recent   
repairs because of Death Watch Beetle  
which eats stones and wood. At the     
moment the Castle has scaffolding      
around the western wing.
