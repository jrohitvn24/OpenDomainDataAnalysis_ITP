		<title>14Bradfield's Moorland</title>
		<content> This area has a number of patches of  
 moorland. Heather, bilberry and tufty 
 grass predominate.Cotton grass blows  
 gently in the wind. The heather       
 prvides a good cover for breeding     
 birds. Lapwings were seen and heard   
 defending their teritory and          
 displaying. A cuckoo was spotted being
 mobbed by meadow pipits. A sparrowhawk
 whizzed by during late morning. The   
 curlew's warble was heard and the     
 skylark sang constantly. The call of  
 the red grouse was also heard. Sadly, 
 litter, in the form of empty cans and 
 glass bottles was also seen, dropped  
 by careless hikers, it spoiled the    
 beauty of the area.
