		<title>12ASTLEY BRIDGE FARM (1)</title>
		<content>The Calcutt's have farmed at Astley    
Bridge for the past 22 years.They have 
owned it longest of all the farms to   
be found around Merton.Some of their   
land is very good because it has been  
drained by putting pipes under the     
fields.This was finished about 10years 
ago and should last for 100years.The   
fields used to be ridge and furrow.One 
or two of these have been retained for 
conservation purposes and these contain
many wildflowers including orchids.The 
River Ray flows through the farm and   
sometimes floods the fields near its   
banks.Machines used on the farm include
combine harvesters,ploughs and 3       
tractors.They also possess are large   
corn dryer so that when it is time to  
sell the wheat they grow it is very    
clean,dry and at its best.
