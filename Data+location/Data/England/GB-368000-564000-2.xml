		<content>   The land to the north of Haltwhistle
 rises steeply and most of the farms in
 our survey area are classed as hill   
 farms.  The stock kept are suckler    
 cows which are specially bred to      
 withstand harsh winter weather and    
 herds of sheep which are kept out on  
 the fell for most of the year.        
   Haltwhistle is famous for its       
 Blue-Grey cattle which are a cross    
 between a White Shorthorn and a       
 Galloway.  There is an annual mart in 
 the town at which they are sold.      
   The main breeds of sheep kept are   
 Scottish Blackface, Swaledale, Welsh  
 Mountain and Herdwick, all very       
 hardy sheep.                          
   The hill farmers are worried that   
 they might be unable to feed their    
 stock this winter as the continual    
 rain this summer prevented many from  
 harvesting any hay at all.            </content>
