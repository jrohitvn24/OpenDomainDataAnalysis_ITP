		<title>04LANGNEY SHOPPING CENTRE 1</title>
		<content> Much of Langney Shopping Centre is a  
 carpark.When all the car and taxi     
 spaces are full a 1000 cars are parked
 in it.Langney Centre has two large    
 supermarkets, Sainsburys and Tesco.   
 It has quite a lot of smaller shops.  
 On Thursdays and Fridays there is late
 night shopping until 8.00pm

 When I go to Langney with my mum and  
 dad ,we go by car on a Friday night   
 because that is when my dad gets paid.
 We go to buy food for the week.We shop
 at Sainsburys ,but before we go into  
 Sainsburys, I go down to Comet with my
 dad to get a price_list paper.Then we 
 go into Martins the newsagents and my 
 mum looks at the papers ,then we go   
 into Sainsburys.We spend about Â£30 on 
 food.When we come out we load up the  
 car, and we get in and drive home.
