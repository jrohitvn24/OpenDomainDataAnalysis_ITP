		<title>18A Walk In the Chilterns.</title>
		<content>   We set off from the school on Friday
July 5th 1985 and walked along the     
A4010 towards Great Kimble.            
   We passed fields of barley,hay and  
grass. In Great Kimble we turned South 
East along the North Bucks Way. On the 
northen side the land is a nature      
reserve belonging to Bucks, Berks      
Oxford Naturalist Trust and there was  
an abundace of the spotted orchid. We  
crossed a grass field which was ready  
for cutting and then joined the        
Ridgeway Path with woods on the West   
side and fields of spring barley and   
winter wheat on the East side. We      
retraced our steps to the Old Rifle    
Butts on the slopes of the chilterns   
facing west and below was a field of   
oil seed rape.The woods slopes form a  
National Trust Nature Reserve.We       
crossed the road and followed a        
foot-path to the golf course.          </content>
