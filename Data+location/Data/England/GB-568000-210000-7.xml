		<title>07SPARROWHAWK WOOD</title>
		<content>{  Sparrowhawk Wood }is privately      
 owned                                 
 and is used as a pheasant shoot.It    
 is mainly a{deciduous wood}with Horn  
 Beam trees and a few Elm and Beech.   
 The undergrowth is mainly bramble     
 with bluebells,nettle and grasses.    
   In the centre of the wood there is  
 some ploughed earth in which the      
 farmer planted{Runner Beans, Barley   
 and{Maize}to attract the birds.Near   
 the ploughed earth there is a metal   
 tub with corn in for feeding the      
{rabbits}and{pheasants.}Naturally other
 birds take advantage of this.         
  The farmer digs small holes in the   
 ground and covers them with a plastic 
 lining so that the rain collects and  
 provides drinking water for the birds.
  As part of the management of the wood
 the farmer is planting pine trees     
 around it as a wind break.            </content>
