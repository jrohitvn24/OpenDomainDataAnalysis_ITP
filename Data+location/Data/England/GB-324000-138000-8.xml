		<title>08The Rector,Cannington</title>
		<content> Our village rector has been a         
 vicar since the age of 23;he is now 45
 and has never regretted becoming a    
 vicar. He finds it a very interesting 
 job, but it sometimes has its bad     
 sides . His family are affected by his
 low wages, which are just enough to   
 keep his family.                      
 If he was not a vicar he would rather 
 be a journilist.He was a teacher for a
 short time and also worked in a pub.  
 He has about 3-5 services a day and   
 more on a Sunday. He most dislikes    
 holding funerals for small children.  
 He lives in the  rectory which is just
 across the road from the church.He has
 to get up at 7.30am each morning and  
 go and ring                           
 the bells.  After that he says morning
 prayer, then he holds a service.
