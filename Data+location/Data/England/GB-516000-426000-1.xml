		<title>01THE HEDON AREA</title>
		<content> Our block includes the town of{Hedon,}
 a small village called{Paull}and an   
 industrial complex at{Saltend.}The    
 rest of the area is farmland.         
 The centre of{Hedon}is very old but on
 the outskirts there are several new   
 housing estates.{Hedon}was a new town 
 in the Middle Ages,but 100 years later
 it was a flourishing market town and  
 port.The name{Hedon}probably comes    
 from{Heah-dun}which means an          
 uncultivated hill.                    
 The street names are interesting too  
 and tell us about early trades and    
 crafts.The earls of Albermarle started
 the port in{Hedon}in the 12th century 
 when ships were able to travel up the 
 Haven.Later,trade was lost to the port
 of Wyke,later called{Hull}so by the   
 time{Hedon}got its charter in         
 1348,very few ships used the port.
