		<title>17Social Concerns in Rogate</title>
		<content>    Much interest is  maintained in the
 village by amateur historians or the  
 environment by the Red House a field  
 study centre for King's College,      
 London. But several residents were    
 concerned about the lack of interest  
 for young people who were being       
 attracted to activities outside the   
 village.                              
   A much more pressing concern however
 was the exploration and drilling for  
 oil. Athough this is actually outside 
 the surveyed area, villagers were     
 concerned with the immediate problems 
 of heavy traffic and the possible     
 complete change finding a commercially
 viable amount, would bring.           
   A reduction in the staff at the     
 school was until recently another     
 concern when the number of children   
 dropped, but with closure of Elsted   
 School this has been abated.          </content>
