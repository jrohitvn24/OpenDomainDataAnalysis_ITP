 The newest building by our school is  
{Latton Hall Close,}built in 1985.It is
 purpose-built by the Council to house 
 thirty elderly people.I am Caroline   
 Vaughan,and I live there because my   
 mum is the Warden and looks after the 
 old people.                           
  They all have their own little flats 
 or bungalows,plus a big common room   
 which has a snooker table and organ.  
 Twice a week they have coffee mornings
 and sales.On Wednesdays there is Bingo
 and a raffle.                         
  Built into the Complex is an exciting
 conservatory which is going to have   
 lovely plants and trees.There is also 
 a communal washing machine and tumble 
 drier.                                
  The old people really like their new 
 homes.They can be independent and safe
 as my mum keeps an eye on them.       </content>
