		<title>10STH WINGFIELD _ CHILD'S PLAY</title>
		<content> This is a list of present day         
{playground singing games}:_           
 "Farmer, farmer may we cross your     
 golden river"                         
 "Cat's got the Measles"               
 "Farmer's in his den"                 
 "Orange ball"                         
 "Poor Mary sits a weeping"            
 This is how the "Farmer, farmer..."   
 game is played:_                      
 One child is the farmer and the others
 stand in a line and sing the question 
 to him.  The farmer will only let     
 children cross the river if they are  
 wearing the colour he has chosen.  The
 other children are chased by the      
 farmer.                               
 Other children play ball games such as
 football, chasing games, skipping     
 games and hopscotch.                  
                                       
                                       </content>
