		<title>04THE NORFOLK SHOW - 27TH JUNE</title>
		<content> We had breakfast at 8.00, we had      
 Weetabix.  We left for the Norfolk    
 Show at 11.00.  Me, James, Donna, Dad 
 and Mum went.  When we were nearly    
 there, there was a traffic jam at     
 11.15.  We had our lunch in our car.  
 We had cheese rolls, crisps, Penguins 
 and an apple at 11.50.  We got there  
 at 12.30.  We parked the car at 12.40.
 We got into the Showground at 12.50.  
 We looked round and then it started to
 rain at 1.30.  It stopped raining at  
 2.00 p.m.  We went into the Main Ring 
 at 4.30 and watched parachuting,      
 horse-jumping and men on motorbikes.  
 When we had finished watching the     
 things in the ring we went back home. 
 It was 7.15 when we got home.  We had 
 dinner at home.  We had sausages in a 
 roll, Invaders and potatoes.  Me,     
 James and Donna went to bed at 10.00  
 p.m.                                  </content>
