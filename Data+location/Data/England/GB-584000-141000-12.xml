		<title>12Smarden Chapels &amp; Cemeteries</title>
		<content> The strength of nonconformist religion
 in this area is shown by the 2 chapels
 &amp; the private burial grounds. Bounds  
 Cross Chapel, situated where 3 parish 
 boundaries meet, is a Baptist chapel  
 established in 1880. Like the         
 Particular Baptist chapel at Tylden,  
 Smarden, it has a strong tradition of 
 family support and draws worshippers  
 from far afield. Of the burial grounds
 2 are private: the Sanders burial     
 ground at Obden Farm, disused since   
 the 19th century, and the Offen       
 cemetery at the Roundabout, still in  
 use. Both were begun when the original
 families quarrelled with the local    
 church. Smarden parish has a burial   
 ground near the R. Beult, established 
 when the churchyard became full in    
 1963. Next to the old meeting house in
 Headcorn Road is the Zion chapel      
 cemetery, now also full.              </content>
