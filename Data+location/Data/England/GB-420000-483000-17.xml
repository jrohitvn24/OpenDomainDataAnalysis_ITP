		<content> The Tuesday club meets at the  Rectory
 about once a month.Each month they    
 meet, some_body comes and talks to the
 people who are in the club, like a    
 doctor, vet, etc. The Rector's wife   
 started the Tuesday Club because there
 was not enough amusement for young    
 wives. This gives them an opportunity 
 to meet with other people.            
                                       
 The Parish Lunch is held about once a 
 year in the village hall  .The date is
 often around Christmas. The rector and
 his wife, who are my parents, run the 
 lunch. They have a hot lunch or       
 buffet. Last year we had a buffet     
 dinner at night instead. The choir    
 from Church sang Christmas Carols.    
 People share the preparation in their 
 own houses. The Rev.Thomas usually    
 taking on the task of cooking the     
 meat.                                 </content>
