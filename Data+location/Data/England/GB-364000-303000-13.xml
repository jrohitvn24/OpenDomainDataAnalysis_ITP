		<title>13CORACLEMAKER OF IRONBRIDGE</title>
		<content>{   Mr Eustace Rogers}makes{coracles   
 down by the River Severn. Mr.Rogers'  
 family has been making coracles for   
 generations. The skill has been passed
 down from father to son. Mr.Rogers is 
 the only coracle maker in England. As 
 Mr.Rogers has not got a son, he is    
 training a young man to follow him.   
    In the past coracles have been made
 by men to cross the river to avoid    
 the daily toll on the bridge. So a man
 would build himself a cheap small boat
 to cross the river.                   
    To make a coracle, first you make a
 hoop made from woven pieces of ash    
 wood and paint the basic woven shape. 
 Then add a calico cover with bitumen  
 on the underside. The small ones cost 
 Â£1 or Â£2, the large wooden ones are   
 Â£80 and the large skin and fur ones   
 cost Â£180 each.                       
                                       </content>
