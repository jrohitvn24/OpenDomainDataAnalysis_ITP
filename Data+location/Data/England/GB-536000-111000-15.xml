		<content>  {Warningore House}is off the B2116   
 between Lewes and Plumpton.The        
 McGregors live there.They live in the 
 country because they hate towns.The   
 disadvantages of living in the country
 are that it's muddy and very windy and
 they get snowed in in the winter.They 
 shop in Lewes.The farm is very near   
 Warningore House.                     
  There are 16 rooms and a flat with   
 3 rooms.All the rooms except the flat 
 are used.The house is one room wide   
 in the traditional Sussex style and   
 the walls are 10 inches thick.There is
 a well 20 feet deep under the house.  
  There are 5 unused stables,but they  
 have 2 dogs and 3 cats.They have a    
 pond with a decoy heron to stop other 
 herons eating the 400 goldfish.       
  They own 13 acres of land,10 of which
 is rented to the farm. They only grow 
 vegetables and they cut all the grass </content>
