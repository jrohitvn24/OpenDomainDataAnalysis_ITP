		<title>20Clacton Carnival Queen</title>
		<content>      Each year, in conjunction with   
 Clacton Carnival, a Queen is selected 
 as a figurehead for the events of the 
 week.                                 
     A selection dance is held in      
 May at Highfields Holiday Camp, and   
 during the evening Miss Clacton is    
 selected and crowned, along with a    
 senior princess, a junior queen and   
 two junior princesses. They have a    
 long and busy summer ahead, as they   
 visit other local Carnivals on many   
 weekends during the season.           
     During the Carnival week itself   
 the queen and her court attend all the
 events, selling raffle tickets,       
 drawing prizes and generally making   
 sure that the visitors have a good    
 time.                                 
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
