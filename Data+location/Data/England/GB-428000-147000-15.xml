		<title>15    The Village Shop.</title>
		<content> The widespread use of the motor{car   
 for individual travel has meant that  
 people are no loger confined to their 
 immediate area as they used to be.  It
 is difficult to realise now that      
 before this century the fastest means 
 of{transport}was the{train}and before 
 that the{horse. }A choice now exists  
 for people to shop where they please  
 and the larger towns with bigger and  
 more competitive shops attract the    
 customers from miles around.          
                                       
 The two{shops}in the block surveyed   
 are typical of the local amenities    
 competing for survival and forming    
 consortia to gain better wholesale    
 prices.  Emphasis is on service and   
 the small shopkeeper is finding it    
 increasingly difficult to survive.    
 Local{Post Offices}are closing or     
 under threat.                         </content>
