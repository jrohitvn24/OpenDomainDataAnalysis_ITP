		<title>07FAMILY LIFE IN DIDSBURY</title>
		<content>  The average family in Didsbury has   
{two children.}Often both parents work 
 outside the home.Women stop work to   
 have a baby but many return soon      
 afterwards.{Mothers}are usually the   
 ones to have time off to look after   
 sick children.                        
{ Television}is very important in most 
 families.Sometimes programmes are     
 watched together but there can be     
 friction when there is a question of  
 priorities in viewing time.           
{ Activities}in which families join in 
 together include eating meals both at 
 home and in restaurants, visiting     
 relatives,sports, walking in the      
 countryside and going to places of    
 interest.                             
  Once children start full-time school 
 families see most of each other on    
{holiday.}This may be home or abroad.  
 Travel is usually in the family car.  </content>
