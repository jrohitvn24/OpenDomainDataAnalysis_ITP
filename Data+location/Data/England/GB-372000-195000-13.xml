		<content> Mr and Mrs Davey are ready for work at
 6:00 am,when the newspapers are       
 delivered. At 6:45 the paperboy and   
 girl call for their round. There are  
 not many customers before 9:30 except 
 for school children and workers.      
 Between 9:30 and 1:00 pm 27 people    
 called,mostly women for groceries. A  
 local farmer bought beer and          
 cigarettes for his haymakers. Mr.     
 Davey has to deliver 100 papers to    
 outlying areas. There are fewer       
 customers in the afternoon so the     
 owners find time to do the paper      
 accounts,check the shelves and put up 
 special offers. They have had an      
 off-licence for one year now. Tuesday 
 is perhaps their quietest day of the  
 week.The owners keep the key which    
 allows tourists to visit the Tyndale  
 Monument, which is 15 minutes walk up 
 the hill, just outside the village.   </content>
