		<content> Some say that problems are lessening  
                                   now,
 It's not so bad at all.               
 The foundations were laid,            
 And people were paid...               
     Whatever the future holds for     
                              Croxteth,
     Will it ever change ?             
     For good or evil, better or worse,
    {Will it change ?}

    People in Stockbridge Village say  
 there should be parks, places for     
 children to play, facilities for mums 
 and babies and pre-school children.   
 There should be more shops and libra- 
 ries, but when the shop-keepers try to
 improve standards the vandals destroy 
 their good work.   There is a weekly  
 disco, but some spoil it for others.
