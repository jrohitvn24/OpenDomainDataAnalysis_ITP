		<content> On East Roughlea there are lots of    
 animals.In the barn were a horse and a
 pony which are pets.There were also   
 some lambs which had lost their       
 mothers.                              
 He has a herd of dairy cows.We saw the
 dairy parlour where they are milked.  
 There were glass pipes which went to a
 big tank with a refridgerator to keep 
 the milk fresh.The milk is collected  
 once a day.He has some young bulls.He 
 is going to keep them for a year then 
 sell them for their meat.
