		<title>07WHAT I LIKE ABOUT HADFIELD</title>
		<content> My name is Amanda Hughes. I am eight  
 years old. I like going to the        
 Brownies because we make things and do
 little books called pocket books. When
 I come home from Brownies I go        
 upstairs and look through my window. I
 see all the hills shining in the sky. 
 My favourite thing is to get on my    
 bike and have a ride round my Close.  
 When I am on my bike riding round I   
 keep on ringing my bell.              
   Hadfield is a lovely place to live  
 in because there is a good school here
 and a big playing field at the side of
 it. Hadfield is a peaceful place where
 little boys and girls go to play in   
 the park. There are swings, slides and
 a see-saw. In my school I have made a 
 lot of friends. My best friend is     
 Lisa. My school is not near the main  
 road. When I get home from school I   
 sometimes play out on my skates.      </content>
