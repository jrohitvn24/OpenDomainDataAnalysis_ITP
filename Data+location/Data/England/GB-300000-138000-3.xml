		<title>03THE HAMLET OF RODHUISH</title>
		<content> Rodhuish is a collection of farm      
 houses and tied cottages built        
 along the slopes of a small valley.   
 Some of the cottages are in ruins,    
 but others have been renovated as     
 holiday cottages for the many tourists
 the area attracts. Once there was a   
 thriving community, big enough to     
 support the church of St Bartholomew  
 and a Methodist Chapel. Some farms    
 seem to have disappeared, the land    
 taken over by neighbours and the      
 buildings are now private owned. Hill 
 Farm has gone altogether. There are no
 shops and not even a pub. Local       
 residents either work on the land or  
 are retired. People go to Minehead    
 or Williton for supplies and rely on  
 the villages of Roadwater and         
 Withycombe for community activities.  
 Watching television would seem to be a
 popular way of spending an evening.   </content>
