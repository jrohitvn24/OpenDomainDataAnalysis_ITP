		<title>05Wildlife around Newton Pop.</title>
		<content> The countryside around Newton         
 Poppleford provides habitation for a  
 variety of wildlife.In a field we saw 
 a Rabbit and Blackbirds playing around
 some Poppies.Just up the road was a   
 big patch of Cow Parsley.As we stopped
 for a rest by the river Otter we saw a
 House Martin swoop over the river.    
 Also there was a metal grid with the  
 holes blocked by mud and reeds and    
 inside this pulp was a Willow         
 Warbler's nest.Along the railway we   
 saw some Pink Campion,Wild Strawberry 
 Plants,a Goats Beard plant,Blackberry 
 bushes,Thistles,Rayless Maywed and    
 plenty of Stinging Nettles!There are  
 plenty of Minnows and a few Trout in  
 the river and Pennywort and Foxgloves 
 grow along the banks.
