		<content> The area is extensively covered by a  
 thick layer (up to 20m in depth) of   
 boulder clay over chalk.              
                                       
 The land is farmed mainly for cerial  
 crops, barley and wheat. Rape is also 
 grown, particularly in the north.     
 There are several pea fields in the   
 centre of the area. Very few farm     
 animals are to be seen.               
                                       
 The farms are large and settlement is 
 sparce. Churchgate Street, with some  
 300 dwellings and Matching Tye with   
 100, are the only settlements of any  
 size. With easy access to the M11,    
 which bisects the area from north to  
 south, house prices are rising.       
                                       
 There are very few amenities.         
 Residents are heavily dependent on    
 Harlow which lies to the west.        </content>
