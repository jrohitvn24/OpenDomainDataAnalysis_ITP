 books.  Usually, however, when they   
 visit the Garden Centre they are in   
 search of information about the plants
 and shrubs.                           
   Questioned outside the Centre,      
 particularly the customers in the over
 40's age group confirmed that         
 gardening is, indeed their main hobby.
   On average the local families visit 
 the Garden Centre at least three times
 each year although some families visit
 to purchase plants as often  as six   
 times in the Spring and early Summer. 
   Most of the gardening is undertaken 
 by the husband but many of the men    
 agreed that their wives were more     
 likely to undertake the weeding and to
 generally keep the garden tidy.       
   Although most of the men preferred  
 growing vegetables their wives liked  
 to grow flowers and shrubs.           </content>
