		<title>03Scotton &amp; Northorpe: Housing</title>
		<content> Most families live in owner occupied  
 property, rented houses being almost  
 entirely council built. In Scotton    
 more than half the 25 council houses, 
 including 12 bungalows for the elderly
 in Dooks Close, are rented: out of    
 Northorpe's 13 council houses 4 have  
 recently been bought by their         
 occupiers. In each village there is   
 still one 'tied' house attached to a  
 farm. There are no estates, local     
 planning policy allows infilling only:
 there is little room left for building
 Of the 150 houses in Scotton less than
 40 are more than 60 years old:        
 Northorpe has a higher proportion of  
 older houses.  House prices are among 
 the lowest in the country: a modern 4 
 bedroomed house in Scotton, with      
 central heating and a large garden is 
 priced at Â£41,000 compared with       
 Â£27,000 for a similar house in 1978.  </content>
