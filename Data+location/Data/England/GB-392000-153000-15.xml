		<content> EDINGTON COUNTY PRIMARY SCHOOL        
 HISTORY - The school was built in 1877
 taking the place of 6 small Dame      
 Schools in the village.It was         
 purchased for Â£490 (including grounds)
 by the parish to abide by the 1870    
 Educatoin act, which required         
 provision for education all children.A
 headteachers 3 bedroomed house was    
 attached. Originally designed for 120 
 pupils, it has never had more than    
 100, although during the 2nd World War
 a number of evacuees brought the total
 to 96. The building has changed very  
 little since its opening, there still 
 being 2 classrooms,2 cloakrooms, and  
 outside toilets in a separate block.  
 The house is now unoccupied and serves
 as a store with one room being the    
 school office. Together with a small  
 field on site, the school has the use 
 of a large playfield 100m away.       </content>
