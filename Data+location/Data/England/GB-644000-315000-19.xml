		<title>19TYPICAL FAMILY WEEKEND</title>
		<content> Saturday mornings we usually get up   
 about 9:30am,have our Breakfast,wash  
 clean our teeth,get dressed &amp; then    
 watch T.V.or go to Yarmouth,or just   
 play with our pets,ride our bike,or   
 rollerskate,or play skipping. During  
 the morning we have a drink &amp; snacks. 
 Most Saturdays Nan &amp; Grandad come to  
 see us &amp; so does our sister.if we     
 don't go out I have to do my homework,
 if not it has to be done in the       
 evening,but most Saturday evenings    
 we all go out. Sunday is usually a    
 lazy day,when we do what we feel like 
 doing.Mum &amp; Dad are up early,we get up
 quite late,but still have breakfast,  
 then we see to our pets &amp; play.Every  
 3rd Sunday we go to church at 3:00pm. 
 At 5:00pm we have tea then we relax.  
 In the evenings we have a cup of tea &amp;
 fresh cream cake which mum makes,we   
 go to bed at 8:30pm.                  </content>
