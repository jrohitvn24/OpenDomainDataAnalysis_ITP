		<content>        Bredhurst Shelter is a santuary
 for  unwanted  cats. It  was opened in
 1977  by  the warden, who  became very
 concerned that cats, unlike dogs, were
 not  recognised as pets by the law. In
 the summer  time, 100 - 120  cats  are
 brought  to  the  shelter for  various
 reasons and they are  kept in runs and
 cages. Some cats  are then sold to the
 public whilst  the rest live out their
 remaining  days  in  the  security and
 comfort provided by the shelter. There
 is  veterinary  accommodation  for ill
 cats  and  the  work  of  the  shelter
 includes neutering  and dentistry. The
 shelter runs a cat sponsorship scheme,
 whereby people, who cannot keep a pet 
 at home for some reason,  can adopt a 
 particular  cat and pay for its keep. 
 They can visit it whenever they like.
