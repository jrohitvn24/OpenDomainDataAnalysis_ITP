		<title>10OUR LOCAL RIVER</title>
		<content> The River Blythe is basically a clean 
 river and is used for water supply.It 
 rises to the south of Solihull and    
 joins the River Cole near Coleshill.  
 The River Tame,84km.long,drains most  
 of Birmingham and the Black Country.  
 Its'tributaries include the River Rea,
 Cole,Blythe and Anker.The River Tame  
 is a polluted river,but substantial   
 improvements have taken place in the  
 condition of the rivers Cole and Rea  
 during the course of the last ten     
 years or so.The outfalls of Minworth  
 water reclamation works,the enormous  
 reclamation works which deals with a  
 large part of the Birmingham          
 conurbation,join the River Tame near  
 Curdworth.These effluents have greatly
 improved in recent years.
