		<content> Our block is an area of almost        
 entirely agricultural land with few   
 settlements. Only two settlements of  
 any size are to be found, these being 
 the villages of Hilmarton and         
 Goatacre, with only part of the latter
 falling  within the block.            
 The only major road which passes      
 through the block is the A.3102, which
 passes in a north/south direction. It 
 crosses the only major water source,  
 Cowage Brook, at the southern end of  
 Goatacre.                             
 To the north and west of the village  
 of Hilmarton, which is found centrally
 in the block, the land rises to a     
 height of 125 metres near Catcomb     
 Farm. To the south and east, although 
 gradually rising, the land has a far  
 gentler slope to it.                  
 The only shop in the block is the     
 local store/post office in Hilmarton. </content>
