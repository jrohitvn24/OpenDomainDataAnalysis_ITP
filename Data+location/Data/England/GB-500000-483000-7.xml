		<content>  Scarborough Mere is situated 5km     
 south of Scarborough at the foot of   
 Olivers Mount. It was man made about  
 100 years ago.The water came from     
 the River Derwent originally but it is
 now fed by underwater springs.The     
 outlet goes underground through the   
 valley out to sea.The cafe and bar was
 built about 40-50 years ago.There are 
 boats available for both adults and   
 children.Also there is a pirate ship  
 called the "Hispaniola" which takes   
 trips out to an island.The Hispaniola 
 was built at Beverley especially for  
 the Mere in 1954.It is an exact       
 replica of the real Hispaniola.The    
 depth of the Mere varies from 1.5m to 
 5m,with a channel of 3m for the       
 Hispaniola.The Mere is also used for  
 water skiing and fishing.It is a      
 popular attraction for Scarborough    
 visitors.                             </content>
