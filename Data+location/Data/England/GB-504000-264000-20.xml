		<title>20A Walk In Swineshead</title>
		<content> Enter the village from the east which 
 is one of the most attractive         
 approaches, the church spire is seen  
 behind the brown colour washed        
 cottages and the frontages of Three   
 Horseshoe Cottage and School House    
 catch the eye. Walking through the    
 village one cannot fail to notice that
 the village is full of character and  
 interesting buildings most of which   
 are on the conservation list. The     
 church is an impressive designed      
 building in Early English style of    
 12th Century.                         
 One gets to feel the character and    
 warmth of Swineshead. The contrast    
 between the huddled buildings and the 
 more spacious ones, the consistent    
 building materials, the presence of   
 some of the boundary walls and the    
 continuation of hedgerows and trees   
 add to the pleasure of the walk.      </content>
