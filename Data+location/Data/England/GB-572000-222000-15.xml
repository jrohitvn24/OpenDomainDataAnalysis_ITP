		<title>15Braintree's Traffic System</title>
		<content>    The one way system has many        
 advantages and a few disadvantages.   
 The advantages of this system are that
 traffic jams in the centre of the town
 are reduced as traffic flowing from   
 the east runs around the south side of
 the town while vehicles from the west 
 continue along the A.120 rejoining the
 east bound vehicles on the outskirts  
 of the town.                          
    The disadvantage is that narrow    
 roads slow the wide heavy vehicles, to
 a crawl especially at the crossroads  
 by the White Hart Hotel. This corner  
 has been the cause of many accidents  
 as long wheelbase vehicles cannot     
 negotiate the tight bend.             
    A second problem is caused on      
 Market days when traffic is funnelled 
 though the narrow streets and delays, 
 due to the number of vehicles, build  
 up.                                   </content>
