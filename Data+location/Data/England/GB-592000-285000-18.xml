		<content> Our area has typical Breckland light, 
 sandy and gravelly soils, ideal for   
 the Forestry Commission's needs.      
 Silviculture, in the l930's when our  
 area was first planted as part of     
 Thetford Forest, represented the best 
 form of land use, whilst affording    
 potential employment.  We have stands 
 of Corsican Pine and Scots Pine, with 
 more recently planted deciduous       
 margins.                              
                                       
 Many of the conifers are now reaching 
 maturity and will be felled for pit   
 props and fencing posts.  It is hoped 
 that replanting will take place, not  
 only because of the country's timber  
 shortage, but also because these areas
 provide a haven for wildlife, a       
 valuable area of recreation for many  
 visitors and jobs for our village.
