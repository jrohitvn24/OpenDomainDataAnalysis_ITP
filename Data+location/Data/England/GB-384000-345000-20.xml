		<content>Newcastle claims to be the major       
shopping town of North Staffs. Recent  
developments have not all been welcome.
Fine Fare Supermarket.The competition  
between supermarkets is fierce and the 
Fine Fare Store was decorated in large 
orange,white and green stripes.Many    
letters of protest were written to the 
press.It was called a giant humbug.    
The Roebuck Centre preserved a Georgian
frontage while building a modern       
shopping centre behind it.This attempt 
to preserve the character of the town  
was welcomed but many of the shops have
still to be let.                       
Now a development is planned that will 
provide a large department store, 30   
other shops,multi-storey car park and  
bus station.A protest meeting filled   
the Guild Hall.A petition was organised
People fear that it will change the    
town completely.                       </content>
