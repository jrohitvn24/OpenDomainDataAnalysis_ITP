		<title>19ASIAN COMMUNITY,BOLTON</title>
		<content> We interviewed a nursery nurse who has
 lived in Bolton all her life. First   
 she lived in Park Road and now she    
 lives in Cross Ormrad Street. Her     
 father moved to Bolton 22 years ago to
 work in the then prosperous cotton    
 mills of Bolton. Her mother moved here
 twenty years ago and she speaks       
 Gujarati,Hindi and English. Her father
 moved from Burmah so he can speak     
 Burmese,Gujarati,Urdu and English. She
 worked at Pikes Lane School because   
 she realised the need for a nursery   
 nurse as 90% of the children were     
 Asians . The area on the opposite side
 of the railway line is mostly occupied
 by Asians or Indians who have formed a
 kind of community.There is a mosque   
 where she lives and she thinks that is
 why a lot of Asians live there.
