		<content> The 'modern' village of Bolnhurst lies
 around a cross-roads on the Bedford to
 Kimbolton road. This has developed,   
 originally as a farming community in  
 the past five hundred years and still 
 retains numbers of cottages typical of
 the area, many of which though have   
 been modernised.                      
                                       
 The parish church is situated almost a
 mile from the present centre and      
 indeed some way off the Thurleigh road
 from which it can be reached. It is   
 thought that the church stood at the  
 centre of the 'old' village which was 
 abandoned after the Black Death and   
 never re-occupied.
