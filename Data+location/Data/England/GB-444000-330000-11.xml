 New Sawley has a purpose built        
 Government Rehabilitation Centre and  
 Skill Training Centre on the          
 Wilsthorpe Road which was erected in  
 1947 to retrain men leaving the armed 
 forces after the Second World War, in 
 construction trades such as           
 engineering and welding.   It is also 
 a retraining establishment for the    
 disabled and long term unemployed.    
 The Skill Training Centre section is  
 used to sell training to employers -  
 to up-grade the skills of employees.  
 This section will be closed in March
