		<title>18VILLAGE NEAR DARLINGTON</title>
		<content> The land at Blackwell Village used to 
 be farmers land.They used it for their
 crops or to keep their animals in.    
 Blackwell Grange was once a large     
 mansion, belonging to a rich man named
 George Allan, in the 1600's.It is     
 now a hotel. Some houses date back to 
 the 1800's and were once stables and  
 haylofts. Two shops near there were   
 built in the 1930's and they are a    
 food shop and a newsagents and a      
 post-office. From there more than     
 1,000 people have things delivered to 
 them weekly. Around Grangeside some   
 houses are very recent and have only  
 just been moved into. We interviewed  
 some one whose house was only fifteen 
 years old. These houses are mostly    
 link-detached and quite large. Also   
 some are semi-detached.
