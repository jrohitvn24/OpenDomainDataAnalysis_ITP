		<content>   Hooliganism on the terraces.        
   This was another topic that everyone
 talked about.                         
   Most people were concerned about the
 general level of behaviour in the     
 country . They were disturbed by      
 football hooligans, muggings,         
 especially of old people,drug abuse   
 and attacks on children.              
   Many people thought that sports     
 stars were paid too much money and    
 that made them over competitive.      
 The tragedy in Belgium made everybody 
 more annoyed about the few fans who   
 spoil other people's enjoyment.Many   
 people think it is just part of the   
 trouble we see all over the world.    
   We think that spectators are getting
 worse at all sports and that many of  
 them go to see the worst side of the  
 game such as McEnroe arguing with the 
 umpire or rugby players fighting.     </content>
