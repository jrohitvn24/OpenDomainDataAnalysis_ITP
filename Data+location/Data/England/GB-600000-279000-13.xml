		<title>13GARB. RECREATION GROUND.</title>
		<content>   This has been public land for very  
 many years and has been taken into    
 trusteeship by the Parish Council as a
 playing field and children's play     
 area. It is in regular use by the     
 local football club and children have 
 swings, slide, climbing apparatus,    
 etc. 1977 saw the building of the     
{'JUBILEE' PAVILION,}funded by public  
 subscription and a grant from District
 Council. Built by voluntary labour, it
 has toilets and an L shaped room with 
 kitchen fitments. The total cost was  
 just under Â£4100.                     
   Hire{CHARGES}at Â£1.75 are less than 
 the village hall but space restricts  
 its use to smaller groups.            
   The Recreation Ground Committee is  
 smaller than that of the village hall 
 but manages to do all{MAINTENANCE}and 
 decoration work by periodic working   
 evenings or days .                    </content>
