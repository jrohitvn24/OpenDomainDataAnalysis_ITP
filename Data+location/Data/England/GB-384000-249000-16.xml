		<title>16NORTON CHURCH.</title>
		<content>  Before Norton's 'modern church' there
 was a previous wooden church built    
 before the Norman Conquest.But the    
 actual church (St James The  Great) is
 believed to have been started by the  
 Normans around 1080.The walls are     
 built of thick,local stone, some 13   
 feet wide.                            
  The bell tower has 3 bells in it     
 dating from 1450 to 1716.In 1925 the  
 bells had their clappers replaced and 
 the original ones are now on display  
 in the church.                        
   The church although small caters for
 the village needs quite well.         
  The church and its grounds are used  
 for many different things apart from  
 services such as Fetes,Social meetings
 and Sunday school.The church also has 
 its own choir. Many other events take 
 place in the Parish Hall which is in  
 another part of Norton.               </content>
