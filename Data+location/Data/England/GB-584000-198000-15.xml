		<title>15My House</title>
		<content> My house is called Scarr Cottage,but  
 when it was built, approximateley 225 
 years ago it was two cottages.We think
 they were built on the site of another
 house called Pains Hall,and possibly  
 the present chimney stack dates from  
 the earlier house.It is a timber      
 framed building with black weather    
 boarding and clay peg tiles on a      
 manzard roof.Since we extended the    
 cottage in 1980 we have a large lounge
 ,dinning room,kitchen,downstairs      
 toilet and upstairs we have four      
 bedrooms and a bathroom.We have a lot 
 of exposed timbers in the walls and   
 ceilings and open brick fire places.  
 Our furniture is cottage style,mostly 
 antique.                              
       It is situated just outside the 
 village of Cold Norton in Stow Maries.
