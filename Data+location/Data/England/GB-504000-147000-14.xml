		<title>14A WEEKEND IN SHERE</title>
		<content>   At the weekend I went out to London 
 with Mummy and Auntie Ruth and Auntie 
 Jane. We had to go on the train. We   
 went to a place where there were      
 beautiful parasols,sitting on a chair 
 was a lady she was wearing tights like
 spiders webs and black shoes,a black  
 dress and black net over her face. We 
 went into a shop and I bought a pencil
 with a rubber on top and a stick with 
 a parrot on top. After that we went to
 the theatre to see the show 'Forty    
 Second Street'. Suddenly they banged  
 huge coins down onto the stage.  Then 
 they came on with garlands of flowers 
 and pretty green dresses. Next there  
 was a bit of ballet,and oh dear,a lady
 broke her ankle and another one took  
 her place. Then it was the end and    
 they had a lovely finale.
