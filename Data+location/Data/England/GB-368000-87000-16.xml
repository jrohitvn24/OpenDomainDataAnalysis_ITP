		<title>16Two Historic Houses</title>
		<content>  {Came House}is very conspicuous, as  
 it is an isolated greyish white       
 Georgian building, surrounded by the  
 lush green woods and fields of the    
 Winterborne Valley. Major Martin's    
 wife's family have been connected with
 Came House since 1754, when it was    
 built to a design by Francis          
 Cartwright. It is built of Broadmayne 
 brick, and faced with Portland stone. 
   {Herringston House}is now lived in  
 by Major General Williams, whose      
 family have been there for over 500   
 years. There has been a settlement    
 since Saxon times because of the      
 abundance of water from the ground    
 and flint for tools from the          
 local chalk pits. The present house is
 Victorian with castellations above its
 family motto "Nil Solidum"  Nothing is
 Eternal.
