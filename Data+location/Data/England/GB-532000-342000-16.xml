		<title>16The Port of Boston Docks</title>
		<content> Boston dock has just had a new crane. 
 The crane can lift 45 tonnes and it   
 weighs 80 tonnes.The crane was built  
 in Boston docks itself.The parts of   
 the crane came from                   
 Stoke-on-Trent.The dock is now the    
 most commonly used in Lincolnshire and
 is modernising very quickly.The main  
 cargo which is imported is            
 timber,coal,cows,steel and            
 potatoes.The main exports are         
 grain,steel,coal and coke.The port and
 harbour of Boston is also responsible 
 for maintenance of the Channel        
 ,quays,mooring,bouys,jetties,beacons  
 and lights.There is a dredger which   
 dredges the river where ships have    
 come in to stop.It sucks the silt up  
 which would stop the ships coming in  
 or out.
