		<content>{  Moorland ponies,}owned by farmers   
 with commoners' rights grazed on rough
 pasture. They were not true moorland  
 ponies but were hybrids.              
   At Huckworthy Lodge on the other    
 side of the valley, there was a       
{riding stable,}with a special paddock 
 for teaching novices.                 
{FENCING }                             
 Boundary fences were mainly to be     
 found on the higher land.These        
 consisted mainly of a base of dry     
 stone walling with strands of wire    
 above,with the top strand barbed.The  
{stone walling}was sometimes newly     
 repaired but not fixed with mortar.   
 At the entrances to some fields were  
 timber sheep{pens,}recently           
 constructed, designed not only for    
 normal sheep penning,but also for easy
 collection and delivery from market.  
 Hedging found lower down the valley.  </content>
