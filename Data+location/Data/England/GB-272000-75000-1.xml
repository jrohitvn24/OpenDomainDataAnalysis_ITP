		<content> Haytor rocks (1490 ft) are perhaps the
 most well known rocky outcrop within  
 the Dartmoor National Park.  It is the
 start point for many walks and each   
 year the rocks are climbed by many    
 thousands of visitors, who are        
 assisted by the steps that were cut   
 into the rocks during the nineteenth  
 century. Although by no means the     
 highest tor on Dartmoor, Haytor is the
 most visible and outstanding tor      
 viewed from the southern part of      
 Devon. Especially from the main A38   
 trunk road to Plymouth Haytor's twin  
 tors can be seen as an outstanding    
 landmark.  The area is virtually all  
 moorland with grazing for sheep,      
 cattle and Dartmoor ponies.  Other    
 tors in the area are Rippon Tor to the
 S (473 metres), Saddle, Holwell and   
 Hollow Tors.
