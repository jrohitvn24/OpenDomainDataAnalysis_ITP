 1833. IN 1841 AN URBAN DISTRICT       
 COUNCIL TOOK OVER. THEY MADE THE CRIER
 SELF-EMPLOYED. HE WAS PAID FOR        
 OFFICIAL CRIES BUT HE COULD ALSO CRY  
 FOR TRADESMEN. THE LAST RECORDED TOWN 
 CRIER WAS IN 192O. THE OLD CRIERS WORE
 A RED CLOAK AND A TOP HAT. THEIR BELL 
 IS IN THE HERNE BAY MUSEUM. THE JOB OF
 TOWN CRIER WAS REVIVED IN 1977. THE   
 TERMS OF OFFICE WERE "ONLY THOSE CRIES
 REQUIRED BY THE APPOINTEES ATTRACT    
 RENUMERATION BUT YOU SHALL BE FREE TO 
 CRY FOR WHOSOEVER SHALL REWARD YOU".
