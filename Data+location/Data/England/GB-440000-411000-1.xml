 Hemsworth appeared as{Hamelseworde}in 
 the original Domesday Book.  It       
 changed from a largely agricultural   
 settlement to a mining community      
 when Hemsworth and South Kirkby pits  
 were sunk in the late nineteenth      
 century.                              
 At this time there was a large influx 
 of skilled and unskilled labour and   
 rapid housing development occurred as 
 a result;  Most of this is still much 
 in evidence as brick built terrace    
 houses, there are also developments of
 Council houses and estates of private 
 houses reflecting the range of society
 now resident in Hemsworth.            
 The surrounding land is predominantly 
 agricultural with a small village at  
 South Heindly.
