		<title>01The Guyzance Area.</title>
		<content>  The area covered by the survey is    
 situated in mid Northumberland,between
 the A1 Trunk Road and the main East   
 Coast Railway.People have settled in  
 the area for at least four thousand   
 years and today farm names still      
 reflect their Angle and Norman        
 origins.                              
 The area is prime agricultural land   
 and most of the buildings are         
 associated with the various farms.The 
 only communities,other than farms,are 
 Guyzance and a recent development on  
 the Warkworth boundary to the         
 north-east.There is only one other    
 industry within the area,the          
 extraction of water from the River    
 Coquet at Warkworth.                  
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
