		<content>Coulsdon Woods is an {ancient          
woodland,} covering about 8 acres      
between two areas of housing. Coulsdon 
Woods is a {habitat} for many creatures
such as butterflies, badgers, foxes,   
collared doves, wood pigeons and       
nuthatches. There are also many        
varieties of {flowers}, such as dog    
rose, burnet rose and red campion. A   
lot of the woodland has been           
{coppiced}-one of the coppiced ash     
trees is 900 years old. There is one   
sessile oak tree which is a sign that  
the woods are ancient. Some {plans}    
have been put forward to build 18      
houses on part of Coulsdon Woods,      
which the Coulsdon Woods Committee is  
trying to stop. At the moment, the     
Woods are used mostly by local         
youngsters as a {playing area} and by  
teenagers on motorbikes. Some local    
people are very concerned about this.  </content>
