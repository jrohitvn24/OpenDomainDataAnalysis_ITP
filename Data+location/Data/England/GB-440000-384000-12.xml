		<title>12HOUSING-NORMANTON SPRINGS</title>
		<content> The village of Normanton Springs on   
 the Shirebrook has a core of late l9th
 century and early 20th century        
 terraces along the main street. Some  
 of the terraces have recently been    
 demolished.The old village school has 
 been converted into flats and there   
 has been new development of           
 semi-detached private housing.There   
 are also large post war council       
 housing developments to the south and 
 north with sports grounds and parks   
 around the large comprehensive school 
 to the north.Future development plans 
 are for a major link road which will  
 cut through the site to the east.Some 
 work has already commenced on this.To 
 the west a former colliery spoil heap 
 has been  reclaimed for housing.      
 Amenities for indoor recreation,      
 shopping and medical facilities seem  
 to be lacking.                        </content>
