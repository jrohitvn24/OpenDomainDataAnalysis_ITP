		<title>09TRANSPORT in King Lud's area</title>
		<content> Public transport is very limited in   
 the rural areas and tends to be       
 limited to the roads joining villages.
 School children are taken out of the  
 area to school by bus from collection 
 points which can often be arranged by 
 individual parents.                   
 The main road, A607, which joins      
 Melton Mowbray with Grantham passes   
 through the north west corner of the  
 area. This road is extensively used by
 heavy transport throughout the year,  
 and is especially busy in summer when 
 used by holiday-makers driving to and 
 from the east coast holiday resorts.
