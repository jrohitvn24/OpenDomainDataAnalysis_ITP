		<content>   The valleys of both rivers,together 
with the smaller valleys of the streams
joining them ,have been designated in  
the Devon County Plan as Areas of Great
Landscape Value.Historical interest can
be found,in the remains of lime kilns  
alongside the river,the Turnpike road  
of 1826 (now A386),with tollhouse at   
Landcross,the remains of the Rolle can-
al of the same date,and the railway    
which superseded it,now itself disused 
(except for the iron bridge used by Tor
-ridge anglers).The two village church-
es are listed buildings and many of the
farmsteads and other rural dwellings   
are interesting.Apart from the A386 and
two other small sections of highway,the
roads are of County Class 111 or unclas
-sified standard,many of them winding, 
sunken,overhung by trees,and edged with
rich verges and hedgerows.Herons at low
tide outnumber the boats at full tide. </content>
