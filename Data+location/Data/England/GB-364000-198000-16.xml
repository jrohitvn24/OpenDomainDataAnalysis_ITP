		<title>16RECREATION IN BERKELEY VALE</title>
		<content> The{Little Avon}is a popular{fishing  
 area with many species of fish to be  
 caught. It flows into the{River Severn
 via{Berkeley Pill}by the{Power Station
 where fishing is best due to there    
 being less weeds, deeper and faster   
 flowing water.                        
 The{Playing Park}is widely used for   
 a number of{different activities.}The 
 top end has swings, slides and        
 climbing frames and there is a large  
 space at the bottom end. The local    
{cubs and scouts}make full use of these
 facilities as their hut is just       
 opposite. A mini{BMX track}built by   
 local youngsters is very popular, as  
 is{cycling}in general due to the low  
 traffic and plentiful country lanes.  
 Other{outdoor}activities include the  
 game of{'arrow-tag'}(following arrows 
 drawn on the pavement),{football}and  
 other sport tournaments.              </content>
