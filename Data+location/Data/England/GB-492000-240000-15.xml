		<title>15CRANFIELD CHURCH</title>
		<content>  In the centre of the village of      
 Cranfield is the parish church of St. 
 Peter and St.Paul. It is situated     
 opposite the lower school and close to
 the public house :The Swan.           
  The history of the church goes back  
 to the Normans. After at first        
 being a wooden building it was        
 constructed of stone towards the      
 end of the 12th century.              
 There is a list of the rectors of the 
 parish on a board inside the porch.   
 One of the rectors of Cranfield,      
 Thomas de Neuby, died of the Black    
 Death when about one third of the     
 population of the village died of the 
 plague. The present rector is the Rev.
 D. Hunt.                              
  The east window is the oldest in the 
 church, but the oldest part of the    
 church seems to be the stone carving  
 in the wall by the south doorway.     </content>
