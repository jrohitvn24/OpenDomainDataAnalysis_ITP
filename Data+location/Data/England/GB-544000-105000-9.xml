 About 10% of the people in Firle have 
 bought their house but some cannot    
 afford it. All the land belongs to    
 Lord Gage and residents mainly rent   
 their homes from him. If there was a  
 major housing development most people 
 would be displeased as it would spoil 
 the village.Apart from tied cottages  
 there are some council houses. there  
 are no flat and very few bungalows.   
 All houses have gardens.              
                                       
{Population }

 are aged between 16 and 60. The

 The smallest group are the under      
 fours. The total number of people in  
 the village is about 82 people.
