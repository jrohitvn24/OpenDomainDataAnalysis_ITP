		<title>12A Child's View of Warton</title>
		<content>    My family have lived in Warton for 
about 70 years.  First was my great,   
great Grandad Tom.  My great Uncle was 
the manager of the Co-op.  Grandad told
me about the changes in the village    
before and after the war.  Croftlands  
estate is where the cricket and foot-  
ball were. The cricket moved away near 
the A6 to Earl Peel's land for a pound 
a year rent to make room for Council   
houses.  The Post Office used to be    
near the church gates and the next door
cottage was a general store.           
    I go to Brownies and Dancing, and  
have just joined the Church Choir. My  
Grandad was in the Church Choir. I go  
to the same school as Mummy and Daddy  
went to.  Daddy plays cricket for the  
first team and is very good. My Uncle  
David and Uncle Tony play for the same 
team.
