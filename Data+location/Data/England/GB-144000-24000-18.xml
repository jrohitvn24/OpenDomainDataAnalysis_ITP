		<content>    {Mousehole Harbour Sports}were     
 first started in 1878, probably as a  
 result of rivalry between the         
 different families of the village as  
 to who was the best at sailing,       
 rowing, sculling or swimming.  This   
 developed to rivalry between the      
 villages, but as the{fishing industry 
 in{Mousehole}declined so did the      
{Harbour Sports}until it was suspended 
 in 1953.  However it only lay dormant 
 to be restarted again in 1978 and has 
 continued until today.  It is believed
 to be one of the few sports of this   
 type which are still held and in 1985 
 there were 34 events listed on the    
 programme.                            
     A collection is made at the event 
 and the proceeds are used so that it  
 can continue as an annual event, any  
 surplus money raised is used to       
 support local{charities.              </content>
