		<title>06Employment in Knockholt</title>
		<content> Besides farms, stud farms and forestry
 there are many other forms of         
 employment in Knockholt. There is a   
 cattery, a kennels, an agricultural   
 contractor (to serve the farms and    
 machinery); there is a woodcraft      
 industry and a blacksmith, who        
 produces all sorts of wrought iron    
 designs. Market gardening is in       
 evidence, also plumbing and building. 
 There is a fishman who sells fresh    
 fish from a van.  Game-keeping is much
 in evidence, especially around        
 Chevening Park. Along the North Downs 
 Way you can see and hear evidence of  
 this, with notices asking you to keep 
 your dog on a lead and wild upward    
 rushes of pheasants and game birds    
 when you approach their nesting areas.
 There are two public houses in        
 Knockholt who do meals and employ     
 several people.                       </content>
