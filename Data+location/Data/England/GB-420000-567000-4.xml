		<content>  The Western By-Pass will be built    
 between Fawdon/Kenton and Kingston    
 Park to take busy traffic away from   
 Gosforth High Street.                 
  A{fly-over}will be built over the    
 Metro track and there will be a new   
{roundabout}on the Kingston Park Road. 
 Pedestrians will be able to cross by  
 using{subways}which will be straight  
 and well lit for safety.There is      
 concern about the amount of{noise and 
{exhaust fumes}which will be created,so
 people living near the By-Pass have   
 been offered free double or triple    
 glazing were necessary.A lot of       
{people are moving}because of the      
 By-Pass.Some have said that they have 
 no objections in principle but{would  
{prefer the road to go under the Metro 
 and a footbridge provided for people  
 to cross the By-Pass.
