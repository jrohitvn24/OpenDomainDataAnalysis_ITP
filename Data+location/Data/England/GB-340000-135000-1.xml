		<title>01Streets Influence on Ashcott</title>
		<content>   Most of the people who live in      
 Ashcott(Pop:1200) go to Street more   
 than once a week. Most of the people  
 who work in Street either work in the 
 big stores such as Tesco or Gateway or
 they work in the High Street shops.   
 There were a few people who worked for
 Clarks. Almost all the people who     
 often went into Street(4 miles away)  
 used their own transport and hardly   
 ever used public{transport.}All the   
 people agreed that Street had better  
{facilities}than Ashcott. Again, we    
 found all the people used Street's    
 facilities. When asked if they would  
 rather live in Ashcott or Street, most
 people said that they preferred       
 Ashcott because of it's{friendly,     
 pleasant{community}spirit. The        
 advantages  of  living  in a  small   
 village  is that  everyone feels  a   
 mutual friendlyness  for  others.     </content>
