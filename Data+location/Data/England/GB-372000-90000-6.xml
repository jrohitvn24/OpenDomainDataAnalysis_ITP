		<content>{ West Knighton:}Lewell Mill is a 16th 
 century building with rubble walls. It
 was originally the mill itself and the
 millers house but has since been      
 modified.                             
  {Woodsford:}Woodsford Castle is      
 undoubtedly the most significant      
 building in the area.The RCHM         
 inventory describes it as "a rare and 
 remarkable example of a small strong  
 fortified house of the mid-14th       
 century".It originally had square     
 towers at each corner and one in the  
 middle if the East side,but only that 
 at the North-East corner still        
 survives. The walls originally had    
 over hanging parapets,but the upper   
 parts of the walls and the roof were  
 rebuilt,probably in the latter part of
 the 17th century.
