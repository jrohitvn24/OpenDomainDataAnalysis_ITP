		<title>13FYFIELD RACING STABLES.</title>
		<content>   Fyfield House and grounds have been 
 used for 23 years as stables for      
 training race-horses. It is quiet yet 
 central for travel. Toby Balding      
 bought it soon after the death of his 
 father and moved from Weyhill where   
 his father, a famous polo player and  
 captain of England from 1930 to 1957, 
 had trained. Mr Balding told us that  
 his stables could hold 65 horses,     
 though during the Flat Season, with   
 the jumpers resting, there were only  
 35. They are fed at 5.45am. and       
 exercised daily for an hour and a half
 on the gallops at Kimpton. Among Mr   
 Balding's 2000 winners was Highland   
 Wedding, Grand National winner of     
 1969. Mr Balding spoke of the vast    
 amount of money involved in modern    
 racing, of the value in millions of   
 the Derby winner and of yearling      
 prices ranging from Â£1000 to Â£4000000.</content>
