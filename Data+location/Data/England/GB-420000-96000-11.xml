		<title>11Animal Deaths on the A.35.</title>
		<content> The main road,{A.35,}is fenced to     
 prevent wild animals from             
 straying.However,the height of this   
 does not prevent{deer}from jumping    
 over.The {Forest Keeper,}whom we      
 spoke to, had to date dealt with      
 approximately four animal deaths.The  
 months March and April are the times  
 when there is the highest number of   
 deer deaths due to the mating         
 season.The Forest Keeper officially   
 only has jurisdiction within the      
 Forest boundaries.However,he does     
 have occasion to deal with deaths on  
 other parts of the A.35,namely that   
 part of the road which runs through   
 the Meyrick Estates.                  
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
