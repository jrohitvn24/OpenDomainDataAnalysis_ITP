		<title>16Witherley Hall: the present</title>
		<content> The Witherley Church Fete was held in 
 the grounds of Witherley Hall in 1985,
 by kind permission of the owner, Mr   
 Chalmers.                             
                                       
 The grounds cover over 3 acres and go 
 down to the River Anker. There is an  
 ornamental lake, and many fine trees, 
 including two Cedars of Lebanon and a 
 maidenhair tree.                      
                                       
 In the grounds also there is an ice   
 house, one of only two in Leicester-  
 shire. This is an underground pit,    
 into which in days gone by servants   
 would, in winter, pack lumps of ice   
 brought from the lake or elsewhere.   
 Packed with straw it could be kept for
 up to two years before being used for 
 refigeration of food in the house.
