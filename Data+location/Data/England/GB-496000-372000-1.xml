		<title>01GENERAL SURVEY OF AREA</title>
		<content> The block assigned to us covers the   
 northern part of Lincoln, an area     
 sometimes referred to as "uphill      
 Lincoln".  It excludes Lincoln's      
 famous landmarks, the Cathedral and   
 Castle, but contains the historic Bail
 area and Newport Arch.  The area is   
 predominantly residential with a wide 
 mix of housing types.  There are areas
 of nineteenth century terraced        
 housing, off Monks Road and Burton    
 Road and areas of expensive middle and
 upper class housing near the          
 Cathedral.  There are two large       
 council housing estates, St. Giles and
 the Ermine Estate. The area contains  
 one of Lincoln's two main hospitals,  
 several schools, a sports centre, a   
 museum, the prison but little         
 industry. Lincoln's main shopping area
 lies to the south, to the west is the 
 Common and north merges into farmland.</content>
