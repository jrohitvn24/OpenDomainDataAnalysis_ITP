		<title>12KEMBLE FETE</title>
		<content>  One of{Kemble's}most enjoyable       
 occasions is the{Kemble}fete at{Kemble
{House.}At the fete we usually have a  
 painting competition. The paintings   
 are dislayed in the house and a lady  
 comes and judges them. This year it   
 was Daphne Neville and her otter, Bee.
  At the Fete there are stalls and     
 competitions, and there are lots of   
 games to play. There is always a      
 raffle. On the lawn by the kitchen,   
 you can get refeshments.{Kemble House 
 garden is very big and beautiful.     
  {Kemble Fete}is good for old people  
 because they have a chance to talk to 
 their friends. This year the fete     
 raised Â£950 for church funds.         
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
