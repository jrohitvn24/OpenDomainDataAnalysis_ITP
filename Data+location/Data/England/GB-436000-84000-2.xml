		<title>02ST.MARY'S CHURCH BROOK.</title>
		<content> The village church in{BROOK,}is       
 dedicated to St Mary.The original     
 church was built on the site by the   
 landowner,before the Norman Conquest. 
 The only remains of this original     
 church is the north aisle,due to a    
 fire.The church was then rebuilt, but 
 in 1863 a further fire destroyed it   
 again.                                
  The church was then rebuilt for a    
 second time in the thirteenth century 
 lancet style using the original       
 archway.A tower was added later along 
 with a shingled spire.                
  The church shows examples of         
 thirteenth century sculpture,an Early 
 English door and silver plate.
