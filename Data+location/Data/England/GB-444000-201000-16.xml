		<title>16Employment in Wootton</title>
		<content>      Most  residents work in Oxford or
 Abingdon.  But   there   is   a  small
 industrial estate which is occupied by
 a  firm that picks up cars from{Cowley
 and   delivers   them   all  over  the
 country. There  can  be as many as 300
 cars  on the site, which creates a lot
 of   traffic.   A   large  mail  order
 warehouse   called   JLB  and  a  huge
 'Wekankarryit' haulage firm add to the
 traffic.  The  car  carrier firm would
 like to extend its hours of working to
 24 hours.  At  present  it  is  closed
 from 8pm to 7am. There are a few shops
 in  Wootton  including  a  chemist,  a
 supermarket and a hairdresser. However
 a  {free  bus }service  to  the  Tesco
 hypermarket  has taken trade away from
 the local supermarket.
