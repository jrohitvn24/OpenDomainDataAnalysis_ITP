		<title>16GREAT COMP COUNTRY HOUSE.</title>
		<content>   This large country house was built  
in the 17th century and still looks the
sane as when it was first built,       
despite many alterations, particularly 
to the rear of the building which were 
made during the 19th century.          
   During the early part of the 20th   
century Great Comp was a centre for    
womem's cricket. A ground with a       
pavillion were built by the owner Mrs. 
Heron Maxwell. When it was not used by 
the women the men of Platt played      
there. The house is besr known for its 
beautiful gardens which are open to the
public.                                
   Mr. Robert Baldwin, a builder, was  
involved with modernizatin work at     
Comp. He remembers when it was possble 
to know everybody in the village. He   
thinks there are too many modern       
buildings which have spoiled the       
village, but he still likes it there.  </content>
