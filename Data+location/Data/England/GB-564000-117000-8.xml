		<title>08THE PRIORY</title>
		<content> The Priory started construction in    
 1412 after the Augustinian monks from 
 Hastings became unpopular and moved   
 inland.The monks stayed there until   
 1537 whenthe Proiry church was        
 dissoluted and the Priory was given by
 Henry the eighth to his Attorney      
 General, Sir John Baker.The Priory is 
 a Grade 1 listed building it was used 
 as a monastery for 123 years. In 1976 
 it was opened as a hotel.The Priory   
 own approx.400 acres of  land.There   
 are quite afew legends concerning the 
 Priory.One is about two brothers in a 
 personal duel,both had swords and one 
 slashed his brothers jaw off but      
 received a blow to the head so one    
 skull has a jaw missing the other the 
 cranium.The skull is now kept in a    
 cupboard in one of the rooms of the   
 Priory.There is only one skull        
 because the other is missing!         </content>
