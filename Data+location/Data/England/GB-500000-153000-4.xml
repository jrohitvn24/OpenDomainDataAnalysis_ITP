		<title>04ST.BEDE'S MIDDLE SCHOOL,SEND</title>
		<content> The school was officially opened on   
 22nd April 1939 as a secondary school.
 It changed to a junior school on      
 5th September 1972. It then became a  
 middle school on 7th September 1976.  
 At present there are about 230        
 children in 8 classes. We have a large
 assembly hall, a gymnasium, science   
 room and library as well as 8 classes.
 Outside we have two large fields and  
 two swimming pools, one of which is   
 heated. Most of the children wear a   
 school uniform of grey trousers, blue 
 pullovers (boys) and white blouse,    
 blue jumper and skirt, (girls).       
 The two feeder schools are Ripley     
 First School and Send First School.   
 Children come to our school from as   
 far away as Wisley and Ockham and are 
 coached to school.
