		<title>15CLEVEDON PUMPING STATION</title>
		<content>{Clevedon pumping station,}situated at 
 the mouth of the {Blind Yeo River in  
{the West End of Clevedon}deals with   
 sewage and floods.It pumps 1,320,000  
 gallons of water a day. The sewage and
 polluted water is pumped to{Kingston  
{Seymour sewage plant.}At the pumping  
 station there is a big metal flap to  
 stop the salt water from the sea      
 getting into the river.               
 In 1936 there were floods in Clevedon 
 which damaged a lot of houses.Sea     
 water flooded Westbourne Avenue, Pizey
 Avenue,Strode Road,Old Church Road and
 Lower Knowles Road. The council       
 decided to build the sea wall higher  
 and make it stronger. There were more 
 bad floods in 1982 and more was added 
 to the defences so that todey the sea 
 wall stands at about 2 metres.
