		<title>06BIRDS OF WELLS SALTMARSH</title>
		<content>The northern edge of the survey area is
an extensive Saltmarsh bordered by sand
dunes and pine trees called East Hills.
It is an important site for wintering  
birds. Some 1250 Brent Geese feed on   
the eel grass, and 1400 Shelduck have  
been recorded roosting on the sands    
during rough weather at sea.           
Internationally important are the      
number of Knot (up to 9000) that feed  
on Bob Hall's Sands. The winter of     
1984/85 saw a roost of 9 Hen Harriers  
in the suaeda bushes.                  
Breeding specialities include Little   
Tern (68) and Ringed Plover (18) and   
650 pairs of Blackheaded Gulls also    
nest here.                             
In addition to the regular visitors    
these marshes have everything a        
migrating bird needs when blown off    
course and Pied Flycatchers, Redstarts 
Whinchats and Warblers gain shelter.   </content>
