		<content> THIS IS AN IMPORTANT THOUGH IN THE    
 USUAL SEASIDE SENSE TOTALLY           
 UNDEVELOPED RECREATIONAL AREA.        
 AN IMPORTANT ASPECT OF THIS IS THE    
 NATURE RESERVE WHICH OCCUPIES MUCH OF 
 THE DUNES ,BEACH AND MUDFLATS AND     
 WHICH IS THE SUBJECT OF A SEPARATE    
 ENTRY. WALKING, BIRD WATCHING,COCKLE  
 DIGGING ,HORSE RIDING, WATCHING       
 AIRCRAFT BOMBING AND STRAFFING        
 PRACTICE TARGETS ON THE BEACH ARE ALL 
 SIGNIFICANT ACTIVITIES. AT ODDS WITH  
 THEM ALL AND IN FACT ILLEGAL IS MOTOR 
 CYCLING ON THE DUNES. THE NOISE OF THE
 BIKES DISTURBS THE TRANQUILITY SOUGHT 
 BY MOST OF THE OTHER USERS AND THEIR  
 TYRES THREATEN TO DESTROY VEGETATION  
 AND ALLOW THE WIND TO REMOVE THE SAND 
 OF THE DUNES.THIS IS OF PARTICULAR    
 CONCERN TO THE ANGLIA WATER AUTHORITY 
 WHICH IS RESPONSIBLE FOR SEA DEFENCES.
