		<title>11LOW FLYING JETS, CHELMARSH</title>
		<content> The aircraft that come over Chelmarsh 
 are sometimes very low.It makes you   
 feel that they are going to land in   
 the playground.The types that come    
 over Hercules,Harriers,Jaguars,F16    
 fighters and jet bombers.We have      
 recently had an airship,helicopters   
 and crop sprayers.                    
     There is an airship called the    
 Goodyear and another called Fuji      
 Film.They are used for advertising and
 for filming.                          
     The low flying aircraft fly low   
 because they want to avoid the radar  
 station on the Clee Hill.They do this 
 as part of an exercise in case there  
 is a real war.We think the pilots use 
 the reservoir as a marker to locate   
 the radar before they pretend to      
 attack it.Unfortunately the school is 
 directly between the two.
