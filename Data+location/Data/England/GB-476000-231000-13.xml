		<title>13School Raises 1600 pounds.</title>
		<content> Great Horwood School has raised over  
1600 pounds this year.                 
 Nearly {1000 pounds} was raised to    
help purchase school equipment,        
including a computer. This money was   
raised by a sponsored event by         
bouncing on an inflatable dragon.      
Children and some members of staff     
bounced for one minute. They were      
sponsored for the number of bounces    
they could achieve in this time. Some  
children managed over 150 bounces.     
 The second event was also a sponsored 
event, a Readathon. Children were      
sponsored for the number of books which
they could read over the half-term     
holiday. The money raised by this      
nationally organised event was for the 
{World Wildlife Fund}. Great Horwood's 
contribution was {#610.75}.
