		<title>18GREEN END FARM.</title>
		<content> Green End Farm had been derelict      
 before the Second World War. Its owner
 was going to develop it into a housing
 estate.However the present owners     
 bought the land in 1949 and restored  
 it into agricultural land.            
 The farm has many varied soils,these  
 are thought to have been brought here 
 by the melt waters from the last      
 Ice-Age.The farm is arable and        
 grass,with the crops and animals being
 rotated to maintain the quality of the
 soil.The farm consists of 60 acres,but
 a further 126 acres is rented.The farm
 is a family concern,worked by the     
 owner and his son.The fields are all  
 bordered by hedges,which will not be  
 removed,a common practice on some     
 farms.There are many historical       
 features on the farm,such as the barn 
 made from a galleon's timbers and the 
 remains of a Roman settlement.        </content>
