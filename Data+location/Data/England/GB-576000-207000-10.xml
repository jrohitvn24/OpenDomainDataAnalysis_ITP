		<title>10FACILITIES IN LITTLE BADDOW</title>
		<content>   Although Little Baddow is a very    
 pleasant environment in which to live 
 the people would like to see more     
 facilities available for their use.   
 The younger girls can join the        
 Brownies but there ie very little     
 entertainment for the older children. 
 The irregularity of bus services to   
 the village also makes shopping and   
 social life difficult for old people. 
   Due to changing education policies  
 the village school was closed in 1960.
 The only school in the village now is 
 Elm Green School which is privately   
 run and the majority of the village   
 children travel to Danbury to primary 
 school and to the larger schools of   
 Chelmsford for their secondary        
 education. Despite these problems the 
 consensus of opinion is that Little   
 Baddow is a lovely place to live and  
 few of its people would wish to move. </content>
