		<title>08Eversley Village Pantomime</title>
		<content>    Last Christmas Eversley produced   
 its own pantomime to raise funds for  
 the village hall which is badly in    
 need of repair. Mr. and Mrs. George   
 were asked to produce it, since they  
 had done so in the past.Mr. George    
 started to write Puss in Boots in     
 August, and in September the cast of  
 fifty was chosen. Many other people   
 helped backstage. The cast rehearsed  
 once a week at the beginning and then 
 three times a week. They borrowed most
 of the props and many made their own  
 costumes.                             
    The pantomime was most successful, 
 making a profit of Â£1,095. An extra   
 performance had to be arranged to     
 accommodate all the people who wanted 
 to see it. A pantomime may become an  
 annual event as so much interest has  
 been shown.
