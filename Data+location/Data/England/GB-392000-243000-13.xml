 A window in the Abbey reminds all     
 local people of the traditional       
 acclamation -{"Pershore God Help Us"  
 uttered when the local crop yield was 
 poor and{"Pershore Where do you       
{think?"} when the local yield was high
 and the market prosperous.            
 Older people tell us that it was      
{unheard of to put shoes on the table, 
{to wash clothing on Good Friday and to
{wash on New Year's Day -}The shoes on 
 the table superstition is a common    
 one.  Washing on Good Friday would    
 result in Christ's blood appearing on 
 the clothing and washing on New Year's
 Day will "wash out" a member of your  
 family in some tragic way.            
 It was felt that Pershore people were 
 generally no more nor less            
 superstitious than any other part of  
 England.                              </content>
