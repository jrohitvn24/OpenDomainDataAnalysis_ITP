		<content> I am in the {SILVERBIRDS JAZZ BAND}.  
 We wear black trousers with white and 
 green stripes up the side, a black    
 jacket with silver and green on the   
 collar and a black peaked hat saying  
 Silver birds on it. I play kazzoo. We 
 go out every Sunday and a few         
 Saturdays, we practise every Monday,  
 Tuesday, Thursday, Friday. We have a  
 single decker tour bus. {LOUISE ARGILE

{STRAWBERRY HILL} was named in 1826 and
 is a smll mound rather than a hill. It
 has oak trees on it and they are quite
 old. Strawberry Hill could be man made
 and may have been a stand for hunting.
 There is very little information about
 it. Now it has a public footpath over 
 it so people can walk and picnic      
 there.              {MATTHEW WEAVER   </content>
