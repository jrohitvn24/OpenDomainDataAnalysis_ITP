		<title>03Mentmore Village</title>
		<content> The majority of dwellings in Mentmore 
 village were built as estate cottages 
 by the de Rothschild family in the    
 late 19th century, in the distinctive 
 Rothschild style of stuccoed brick    
 with black painted timber mock-Tudor  
 facings. No new building was allowed  
 until after the sale of Mentmore      
 Towers estate, and most houses are now
 privately owned. Approaching from the 
 Wing Road we find one house and a     
 cottage on the left, in what was      
 formerly the estate woodyard.Buildings
 there became the Gas House to supply  
 gas to the mansion, then were conver- 
 ted to supply electricity and finally 
 became estate garages. The Coronation 
 Coach was kept there for safety during
 the 1939-1945 war. These buildings are
 currently being converted to houses.  
 The cricket ground and pavillion are  
 further down the slope on the left.   </content>
