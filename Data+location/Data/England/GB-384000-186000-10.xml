		<title>10WE BUILT IT OURSELVES</title>
		<content>    The Scouts,Cubs,Guides and Brownies
 in Sherston have twice raised enough  
 money to{build themselves}an H.Q.     
 Mr.Gordon Dyson,Scout Master &amp; village
 school master initiated fund raising  
 in 1950 for the erection of a wooden  
 hut on rented ground.The building was 
 finished in 1960 at the cost of Â£900. 
    When the plot was required  for    
 other purposes a new fund raising     
 project was started under the         
 leadership of Mrs.D.Dyson.This time   
{several thousands}were needed for a   
 brick building on a permanent site.The
 money came from many small events such
 as jumble sales and from{grants}from  
 official sources.The building was     
 started in 1980 &amp; the{construction was
{undertaken entirely by scouters,scouts
{&amp; well wishers.}The fully equipped hut
 was opened by Mrs.Dyson in 1984 &amp; has 
 since been used for many activities.  </content>
