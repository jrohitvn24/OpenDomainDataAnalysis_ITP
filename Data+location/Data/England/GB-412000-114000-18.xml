		<title>18The Museum _ Fordingbridge.</title>
		<content>   During the 150 years they have been 
 builders in the town, generations of  
 Sherings have unearthed and preserved 
 countless objects of historical       
 interest and in 1975 a{Fordingbridge  
{museum}was opened. The aim of this    
 museum is to maintain a permanent     
 collection of relics and bygones from 
 the Fordingbridge area, together with 
 records of local business, sport and  
 the social life of the inhabitants.   
    It is a non-profit-making concern  
 and run for the benefit of the        
 community, so there is no admission   
 charge, but visitors may make a       
 donation as they leave.               
    It is estimated that there are     
 anything from 5000 to 10000 individual
 items in the collection _ tools,      
 photographs, old documents, household 
 utensils etc. and many of these have  
 now been catalogued.                  </content>
