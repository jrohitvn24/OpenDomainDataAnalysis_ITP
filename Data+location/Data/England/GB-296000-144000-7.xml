		<title>07A DAY IN A GUEST HOUSE</title>
		<content> The day starts at about 7am. After    
 washing and dressing Mum goes to the  
 kitchen and gets breakfast started.   
 Most people choose to eat between     
 8-9am. Breakfast consists of cereals, 
 orange juice, tea, toast and          
 marmalade. The cooked course is       
 sausage, egg, bacon, tomatoes and     
 fried bread. After everybody has      
 finished their breakfast its time for 
 the washing up and clearing up the    
 kitchen. Next the bedrooms have to be 
 done, stripping and remaking the beds 
 that have been vacated and just making
 the beds of those who are staying.    
 Polishing and hoovering is done in    
 every room and when the house-work is 
 finished Mum goes to the nearby       
 caterers cash and carry for the       
 shopping she needs. Then its back home
 to see to the washing and ironing.
