		<content>      The  vicar came to talk to  us.We
 asked him a lot of questions.I asked  
 him how much money they had spent on  
 the repairs.He said they had spent    
 37,000 pounds.Then we asked Mr.Pearson
 "Has the church been knocked down?"   
  The first church was made out of     
 wood.  A stone church was built later.
 I asked the vicar "When do you have   
  services ?"He said that he has       
 communion on Wednesday morning and    
  evening services on Sundays. The     
  next week we went to church and we   
 listened to a communion service. I saw
 my next door neighbour. Then the vicar
 showed us round the church and the    
 yard.We could not go up to the bell   
 tower.It is very dangerous.My teacher 
 works in the bell tower.She rings a   
 bell.
