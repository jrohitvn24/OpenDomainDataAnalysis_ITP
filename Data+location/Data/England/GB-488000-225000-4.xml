		<content> Linslade, being an intense mixture    
 of older-style small work units and   
 general residential housing and flats,
 can obviously not be called highly    
 industrialized. There are several     
 small workshop type companies mainly  
 supplemental to heavy industry in the 
 area.                                 
 Small light engineering units for     
 machining and car body repair works   
 cluster round the station area.       
 One interesting enterprise is in the  
 Soulbury road where a manufacturer/   
 assembler of unusual three wheeled    
 specialist motor cycles has set up.   
 This firm has been recognised by      
 enthusiasts of specialist vehicles and
 has attracted attention in the motor  
 cycle press and magazines although    
 output is very small. Due to economic 
 presures small industries in this area
 have not flourished.                  </content>
