 The smell of petrol fumes as cars rush
 along the A.458,no birds can be heard 
 because of the noise of lorries,cars  
 and vans. Once we are in the wood the 
 sound of birds singing and animals    
 rustling through the leaves can be    
 heard. The petrol fumes have gone,    
 and the musty smell of leaves,trees   
 and woodland comes to my nose.The     
 woodland in which we went was called  
 Spring Valley.We found that just under
 the thin layer of soil was solid sand 
 rock.After going through the wood,our 
 trip took us back out on to the dusty 
 road,up the old Worcester road,not    
 often used now, and passed the'Gallows
 Field' where men where once hung, and 
 on back to school.                    
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
