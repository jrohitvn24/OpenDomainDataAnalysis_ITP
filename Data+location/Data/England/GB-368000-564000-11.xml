		<title>11Police station, Haltwhistle</title>
		<content>   There are 6 policemen and a sergeant
 stationed in Haltwhistle.  With the   
 help of one policeman in Allendale and
 one in Whitfield, they keep the Law in
 an area of about 700 square miles.  A 
 landrover is used to visit remote     
 spots.  Traffic police from Hexham    
 patrol the busy A69 and "specials" are
 on call if extra help is needed.      
   The most common crimes are driving  
 offences, drunken behaviour and some  
 petty stealing.  Haltwhistle does not 
 have a name as a lawless community,   
 though last week children from the    
 Middle School were handcuffed, finger 
 printed and put in the cell.  However 
 this was a friendly visit and after   
 trying on the sergeant's helmet and   
 jacket, examining the contents of the 
 patrol car and wakening up night shift
 workers with whistles and sirens, the 
 police allowed them to return home.   </content>
