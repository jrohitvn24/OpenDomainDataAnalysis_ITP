		<title>20Future plans for Clevedon</title>
		<content> In the year 1985 it is expected that  
 the new shopping precinct will be     
 built. The plans were submitted to the
 people of Clevedon who voted upon the 
 one most suited to their needs and the
 final decision was given by the Town  
 Council. The contract was given to    
 Tarmac Ltd.                           
 It is proposed to extend the road from
 the motorway to form an inner ring    
 road and the car park which is on the 
 northern edge of this area will form  
 part of the shopping area.            
 There will be a large supermarket with
 a pedestrian walkway and the river    
 will be landscaped into a feature of  
 the garden.                           
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
