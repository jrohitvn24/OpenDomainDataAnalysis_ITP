		<content> The original Domesday Book bears no   
 mention to Alfold.  It was, however,  
 recorded in a register kept by the    
 Bishop of Winchester in 1240.         
 The village is surrounded on all sides
 by coppice and woodlands of deciduous 
 trees and conifers.  The soil is      
 typical of the Weald, being heavy clay
 where little grows well except oak    
 trees, grass and some wheat.  The     
 farmers in the area utilize their land
 for intensively managed grassland used
 for sheep, horses, and cattle. A great
 deal of the woodland in the north of  
 the area is managed by the Forestry   
 Commission who keep a check and       
 control on the great numbers of deer  
 who roam freely. There is no heavy    
 industry.  We are served by a village 
 shop and post office, two public      
 houses, a 12th century church, a      
 chapel and a pottery.                 </content>
