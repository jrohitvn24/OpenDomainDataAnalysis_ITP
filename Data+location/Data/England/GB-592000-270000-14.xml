		<title>14A DAY AT MIDDLE SCHOOL</title>
		<content>  My day begins when I get the bus from
Honington to Ixworth Middle School. We 
play in the playground until the bell  
rings for registration. Our names are  
called individually by our teachers.   
  On Mondays all 402 pupils go to      
assembly.The school head or deputy     
gives out notices and tells a short    
moral story. On other days we have a   
reading period where we read a book of 
our  own choice. This is followed by   
8 lessons each day,which include:Maths 
English,Science,French,Music,Drama.PE, 
Humanities,Art,Home Economics,Pottery, 
Craft Design &amp; Technology and R.E. On  
Wednesdays a friend and I run the tuck 
shop at 10:30 (break time), which sells
healthy snacks. Lunch is at 12:00 in   
the hall. We can eat packed-lunch or   
a school dinner. At 13:05 we register  
again and lessons finish at 15:30. We  
sometimes stay for club activities.    </content>
