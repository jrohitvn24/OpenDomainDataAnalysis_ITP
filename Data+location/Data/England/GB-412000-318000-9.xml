		<content> Dairy farming and beef production with
 mainly Friesian cattle are paramount. 
 Since joining the Common Market there 
 has been a growing surplus of beef and
 dairy products  which has led to many 
 farmers being forced to reduce their  
 herds which are now limited by a quota
 system based on 1983 figures minus 10%
 and price of milk to producers has    
 gone down forcing at least 5 local    
 farmers to cease production.Most of   
 the land is pasture but some cereal   
 and root crops are grown.Hay is only  
 produced in small quantities as most  
 grass is cut for silage.A trout farm  
 on the Sudbury Road sells fish        
 directly to the public and also has a 
 licence to restock lakes.Recently much
 of the stock died possibly due to     
 oxygen deficiency.The matter is still 
 under investigation.
