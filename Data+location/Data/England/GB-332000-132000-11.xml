		<title>11A ROOF OVER OUR HEADS</title>
		<content>   There are old{farm houses}scattered 
 fairly evenly over our 12km squares   
 the land being flat and of similar    
 agricultural quality. The village     
 which dominates the rectangle under   
 study has expanded rapidly since the  
 1960's and.The majority of the        
 dwellings are of this era or later.   
 Most of the development has been      
{private estates}composed of{semi      
{detached}houses. There is a{council   
{estate}but this only represents a     
 small proportion of the houses in the 
 village. The{detached houses}which    
 are  few in number are large up market
 dwellings and modern smaller houses.  
    A private estate is being built at 
 the moment by{Westbury}homes and a    
 trip  around the village gives an     
 impression of a dormitory village     
 serving{Bridgwater}and{Taunton}of     
 recent construction.                  </content>
