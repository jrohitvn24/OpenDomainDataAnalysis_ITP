		<content> Many of the larger houses in this area
 are farm houses, occupied by the      
 farmer and his family. Some large     
 houses were once rectories, village   
 school houses, or farmhouses.  The    
 rectory at Acton Beauchamp is         
 currently being altered to provide    
 two self contained flats.  Most of the
 houses are old, though some council   
 houses have been built since the end  
 of the second world war.  With a few  
 exceptions the houses are owner       
 occupied.Several farms have caravan   
 sites where people live on a permanent
 basis, while others have cottages for 
 holiday letting.
