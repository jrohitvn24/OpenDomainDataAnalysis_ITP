		<title>18Over Houses Farm, Botton</title>
		<content> Over Houses is a modern pig farm. The 
 pigs are Large White crossed by       
 Landrace. There are seventy sows which
 can have up to sixteen piglets in a   
 litter. Each sow has seven litters    
 before going to the slaughter house to
 make meat. The piglets stay with their
 mother for about five weeks, then go  
 into 'bungalows'. When the piglets are
 ten weeks old, they are sold to other 
 farms. A wagon comes to collect them, 
 but first they are weighed.           
 There are also sheep at Over Houses.  
 We saw them being clipped.            
 We also saw the ferrets, kept for     
 catching rabbits.                     
 We walked on to the fell and saw the  
 farmer mowing grass in a field        
 surrounded by moor and wetland. The   
 field had been reclaimed by ploughing 
 and draining it so that it would be   
 good enough to silo.                  </content>
