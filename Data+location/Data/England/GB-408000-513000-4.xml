		<content> Just below the village of Whorlton,   
 the R. Tees has bared the underlying  
 limestone rock.  The river bank rises 
 vertically on the north side, but only
 gradually on the south.  The result is
 the creation of a favoured picnic and 
 playing site just beside the river.   
 The area is mown regularly and        
 families from Darlington, Bishop      
 Auckland and Barnard Castle come here 
 for an afternoon in the summer sun.   
 The attraction is the quiet rural     
 setting with safe bathing in the      
 shallow pools created by the rocky    
 river bed and space to picnic or play 
 on the grass with the river and wooded
 banks as a background.  The owners    
 have recently added a miniature,      
 passenger carrying railway.           
 The iron suspension bridge nearby has 
 a weight limit of 3 tons and was      
 opened in 1831.                       </content>
