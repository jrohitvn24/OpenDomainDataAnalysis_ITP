 There is no other post office in our

 The Post van takes the letters to     
 Ripon,Leeds and Harrogate and comes   
 twice a day. It has been coming for 14
 years.                                
                                       
 There is also a post bus which takes  
 people to Ripon because there is no   
 public transport except on Thursdays.
