		<content> The paucity of public{transport}is a  
 persistent complaint from residents,  
 and combined with the lack of local   
 shops is a serious problem for non -  
 drivers.  Of the 32 housholds in the  
 sample only one is without a car.  15 
 have 2 cars and 2 have 3 cars.  This  
 averages at 1.6 cars per houshold.    
 Kingscote has a bus service from      
 Wotton-under-Edge to Stroud and       
 return, running 4 times daily on      
 weekdays, and a minibus service of a  
 round trip from Nailsworth twice daily
 for 4 weekdays.  Only one resident    
 mentioned using buses for shopping.   
 Journey to work is exclusively by car,
 9 people commute between 4 and 10     
 miles, 12 travel from 10 to 16 miles  
 and 7 travel 20 or more miles.        
 Shopping trips are almost entirely by 
 car, to Nailsworth, Cirencester and   
 Tetbury in order of significance.     </content>
