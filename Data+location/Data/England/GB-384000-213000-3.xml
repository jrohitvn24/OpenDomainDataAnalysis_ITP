		<title>03Upton St. Leonard's Church</title>
		<content> The original church was built in      
 Norman times on a Saxon site. Over the
 years many alterations and additions  
 have taken place. The seating         
 accommodation is for 380 people with  
 the exception for the 24 choirsters.  
 The church is often full when special 
 events like school concerts take      
 place. As the population increase more
 and more people of Upton need the     
 services of the church. In 1984 26    
 babies were christenend, 25 couples   
 were married and there were 20        
 funerals. The sunday services are     
 usually at 8 and 10 a.m and there is a
 ceremony at 6.30 p.m. In the summer   
 months on a Tuesday evening there is a
 very popular family service where     
 members of the Scouts, Cubs, Guides   
 and Brownies parade with their flags  
 and in which very young people take   
 part.                                 </content>
