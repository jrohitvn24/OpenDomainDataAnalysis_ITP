		<title>18MAMMALS FOUND IN HOLBERROW</title>
		<content> The largest wild mammal regularly seen
 is the Badger.  Badgers setts are     
 visible on sunny banks around the     
 area, the keuper marl seeming to allow
 good digging.                         
                                       
 Foxes are common and still hunted in  
 the area.  Hares are seen on local    
 farmland and rabbits are returning,   
 some with myxomatosis again.  Grey    
 squirrels are common in local woodland
 although it is 40 years since red     
 squirrels were seen in this area.     
 Insects of particular interest include
 several species of dragonfly and      
 damselfly, butterflies and moths.     
                                       
 Fish in the pond at Morton Underhill  
 include Carp and Roach with the recent
 introduction of Tench.                
 Grass snakes, frogs, toads and newts  
 are also seen.                        </content>
