		<content>  Most of the fields in our area are   
 full of cows, mainly Friesians because
 most of the farms are dairy farms.    
 There are also a number of crops      
 growing in the area,which include rape
 seed,wheat,corn,and barley.Some of the
 fields are kept to grow grass which   
 later will be turned into hay or      
 sileage it would then be stored and   
 fed to cattle when needed.            
 For an example of the crops grown in  
 the area I visited Greenhill Farm.    
 I asked the farmer a few qestions on  
 the percentages of things grown or    
 kept on his land.20% of the crop was  
 silage,20% was barley,40% was wheat,  
 and 20% was for sheep and beef cattle.
 The farmer owned 150 acres.This farm  
 had no dairy cattle which surprised   
 me.                                   
   Most of the fields are seperated by 
 barbed wire,hedges,and electric fences</content>
