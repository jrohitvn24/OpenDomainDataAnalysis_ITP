		<content> Mr. Hart is a local thatcher.He lives 
 in Fleet but he does a lot of         
 thatching around the Tadley area.     
     To be a thatcher you must know    
 that there are three different types  
 of thatching material.The first is    
{Long Straw}which lasts for 20 years   
 and costs Â£3500-Â£4000.Second is{(Devon
{Combed) Wheat Reed}which lasts for 40 
 years and costs Â£5000-Â£6000.The last  
 type is{Norfolk}or{Water Reed}which   
 lasts for 70 years and costs Â£7000-   
 Â£8000.{Norfolk Reed}is very strong and
 is ideal for thatching.               
     The tools used for thatching are:-
 a{legget,}a{reeding pin,}a{mallet,}a  
{side rake ,}a{Bill hook,}a{twister,}  
 and a{pattern block knife.            
{   }Mr.Hart's trademark is a heart.   
     Most thatchers have a{stack       
{decoration}which they print on every  
 roof they thatch.One is an owl.       </content>
