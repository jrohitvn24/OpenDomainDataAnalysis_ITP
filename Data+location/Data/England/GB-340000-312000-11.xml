		<title>11RELIGION AND FORD CHURCH</title>
		<content>   There are two churches in our       
 block.St. Michael's in FORD and       
 another in MONTFORD.                  
   In the 12th century Ford Chapel     
 first originated as a gift from the   
 Crown, and was dependent on the Chapel
 of St. Michael's in Shrewsbury        
 Castle.In 1410 Ford Chapel was endowed
 to Battlefield College,this was until 
 the latters dissolution in 1548.The   
 Crown took control again and sold the 
 benefice in 1590.After this time it   
 passed through many hands until in    
 1927 when the Bishop of Hereford took 
 control.The registers are complete    
 from 1589.                            
    Until 1417 the church was served by
 chaplains of St. Michael in the       
 Castle.Many priests have served since 
 then.The Rev. Robert Sharp took over  
 in 1977.                              
                                       </content>
