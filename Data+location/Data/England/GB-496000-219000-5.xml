		<title>05Tythe Barn, Edlesborough</title>
		<content> The tythe barn at Church Farm,        
 Edlesborough dates back to the end of 
 the 15th century and is one of the    
 oldest of its kind in the country. It 
 would have belonged to the local      
 vicar, who would have been a wealthy  
 man.                                  
    There were two threshing floors    
 which no longer exist. These were made
 of clay or dung, mixed with water and 
 beaten down hard. The villagers who   
 flailed the corn worked by loop       
 lights, narrow slits in the wall which
 produced a dim light.                 
    The whole barn measures about 180  
 feet by 30 feet and is reputed to be  
 the largest barn in England. Just over
 50 years ago there was a public outcry
 when the agent for the owner wanted to
 replace the thatched roof with        
 galvanised sheeting. It was eventually
 relaid with tiles in 1930.            </content>
