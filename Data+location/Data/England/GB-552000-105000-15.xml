		<content> Arlington and Berwick have many rights
 of way. One route is based on the old 
 Roman road, Farnestreet, which ran    
 from Anderida (Pevensey) to Lewes,    
 crossing the Cuckmere River near      
 Chilver Bridge. Around Arlington      
 Reservoir footpaths and stiles are in 
 good condition and well used. The path
 beside Ludlay Coppice has been cleared
 recently by the Manpower Services     
 Commission using unemployed people,   
 and is now easy to walk but another   
 through the old brickworks at Berwick 
 Station is overgrown and almost       
 impassable. The long distance Weald   
 Way path from Gravesend to Eastbourne 
 passes through the area and this      
 section is checked yearly by Polegate 
 Field Paths Preservation Society. The 
 Forestry Commission has laid out a    
 short walk at Placket Coppice         
 especially for the disabled and blind.</content>
