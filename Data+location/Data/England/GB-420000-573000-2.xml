		<content> The first pupils moved into the       
 present building in 1961 but there has
 been a school in{DINNINGTON}since 1827
 and the{Old School}built in 1871 still
 remains. There are now four classes   
 taking children aged 4-9 years and a  
 nursery unit for children of 3. There 
 is a big school field and a schoolyard
 with games and a map of the world     
 painted on the ground. On the South   
 side of the school is a{Checkerboard  
{Garden, }an area of paving stones     
 and patches of soil,each class tends a
 plot. Vegetables, flowers,herbs and   
 grasses are grown, there is also a    
 pond. A kitchen prepares lunches these
 cost 60p for two courses, food such as
 fish and chips, sausage, beefburgers  
 meat,mince and cheesepie, pizza, salad
 and curry is served.
