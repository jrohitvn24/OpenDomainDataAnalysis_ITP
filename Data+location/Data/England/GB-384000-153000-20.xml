		<title>20Where we would like to live</title>
		<content>    We did a survey to find out where  
 people in the village would like to   
 live if they suddenly had enough money
 to stop work.                         
   The most people wanted to remain in 
 North Bradley. A lot of people wanted 
 to move to Devon or Cornwall. Quite a 
 few wanted to move to one of the      
 surrounding villages such as Yarnbrook
 and Hawkeridge. Other than this       
 choices were of scattered towns and   
 citys.                                
   Outside of England people wanted to 
 move to Wales, Scotland, America,     
 Russia, and France.
