		<title>10A WALK TO THE DOWNS</title>
		<content> Turn into the small lane going W.S.W. 
 from the Pound at map ref.30573282;   
 follow the lane (Buckholt Road) until 
 it forks into three unmade tracks.    
 Take the middle track, which climbs   
 steeply between high hedges and old   
 yews. When the track turns left follow
 the path to the right by the{Hampshire
 and{Isle of Wight Naturalists' Trust  
 notice board. Follow the path to an   
 open space among the beeches with a   
 steep-sided coombe to the right. From 
 this point either carry on to the path
 along the top of the scarp with       
 glimpses of the wide view to the N.E. 
 or proceed with care across the steep 
 chalk sward and scrub on the scarp    
 itself. According to the season you   
 will see many interesting wild plants 
 and animals (particularly butterflies)
 for which the area is famous.
