		<title>12EDUCATION IN CLUNBURY AREA</title>
		<content>   There are only two schools in the   
 area, and both of those are primary   
 schools, each with two teachers, one  
 of whom is the head. Both schools were
 built over a{hundred years}ago and    
 each has about{35}children aged{5}to  
{11.}The shool buildings are of stone, 
 with windows set high up in the walls 
 and both have outside toilets.        
{  Clunbury}school has recently been   
 fitted with electric night storage    
 heaters. The{Parent Teacher           
{Associations}of the schools raise     
 money to pay for extras such as{buses,
{computers}and{field trips.}The        
 children go swimming at{Bishop's      
{Castle}every week. Both schools had   
 nearly 100 children 100 years ago. The
 local people are concerned that either
 or both schools may close and the     
 children sent on a longer journey     
 elswhere.{Clunbury}is church aided.   </content>
