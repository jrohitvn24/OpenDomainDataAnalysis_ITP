 waking us up at 7:30am. My sister and 
 I get ready for school. At 8:00am my  
 sister goes to school, at 8:30am I go 
 to school.                            
 My mum and dad are at home until      
 12:30pm, when my sister comes home for
 lunch. At 12:30pm my dad goes to work 
 and my mum takes the dog for a walk   
 and does the house work.              
 At 3:35pm my sister comes home from   
 school, at 3:40pm Icome home and watch
 T.V. At 5:30pm my dad comes home. We  
 have dinner at 6:00pm and at 10:00 I
