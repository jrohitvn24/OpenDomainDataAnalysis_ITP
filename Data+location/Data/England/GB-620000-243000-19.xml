   Freeze-touch is a very good game and
the  person  who  is Â£it' has to try to
touch other players.  When he does this
the other person cannot  move  until he
is touched again by another player. The
aim is to Â£freeze' everyone.           
                                       
   It,  Tig  or  Tag is another game we
pla.  One person who is Â£it' has to try
to touch one of the other players. When
he does the other player is Â£it'.  The 
objective is to avoid being Â£it'.      
                                       
   In  Â£Car  Capers'  each  player  has
four lives. The player who is Â£it' must
touch another player who then loses one
his lives.   If a player loses all four
of his lives  he moves over to the side
of the player who is Â£it'.   The aim is
to save your lives.
