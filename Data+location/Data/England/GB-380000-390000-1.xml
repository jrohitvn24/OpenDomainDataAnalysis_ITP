 The Parish and School of Holy Family, 
 Sale Moor.                            
    Since 1885 the area of Sale and    
 Sale Moor was served by the parish    
 of St. Joseph's Roman Catholic Church,
 Hope Road, Sale. In 1960 land         
 measuring 2.5 acres on the West side  
 of the parish,on Old Hall Road was    
 purchased by Cheshire Education       
 Authority for education purposes.As   
 there had been a great increase in    
 house building in this area, the      
 number of Catholic families had       
 increased and St.Joseph's School in   
 Hope Road could no longer cope with   
 the demand for places.                
    In March 1967, 1.85 acres of the   
 Old Hall Road land was bought by the  
 Shrewsbury Diocese on behalf of St.   
 Joseph's for Â£3,800 and our School was
 built.                                </content>
