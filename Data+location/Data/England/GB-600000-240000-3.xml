		<title>03Transport in Hadleigh</title>
		<content>For many years Hadleigh was a major    
bottleneck on the main Ipswich -       
Sudbury road, the position becoming    
desperate when the bridge over the R.  
Brett was declared unsafe. The open-   
ing of the by-pass has changed the     
whole nature of the town but two       
problems remain.                       
Station Road,joining a growing estate  
to the town centre has two dangerous   
narrow sections without pavements and  
there have been numerous protest       
meetings.                              
Benton Street is a narrow street of    
basically medieval houses and is used  
by the growing amount of traffic going 
to the A12,the main London road.It is  
quite unsuited to this heavy traffic.  
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
