		<title>02ROMAN WALL</title>
		<content>   The{Roman Wall}surrounds the Roman  
 city of Verulamium and is again       
 surrounded by{Devils Dyke}which serves
 as a further defence against invaders.
 One of the many preserved             
 pieces of the wall can be seen against
 the footpath which has railings on    
 both sides with{Devils Dyke}on one    
 side and the wall on the other.At the 
 bottom of this particular stretch is  
 the south east gate,now just patches  
 of{Roman brickwork}arranged in three  
 elipse shaped markings.In Roman times 
 this would be very heavily guarded to 
 prevent unauthorised entry or         
 leaving.There were bridges at every   
 gate crossing{Devils Dyke}although    
 none of these are now in existence.
