		<content> A number of small streams run through 
 the area. The most popular with people
 from the town runs from Dalton Piercy 
 past Brierton Farms. The stream is    
 fairly small although it can become   
 quite swollen with rain. The best     
 viewpoints are close to Dalton, at the
 Brierton bridge and beside Owton      
 Grange. Newts can be seen frequently, 
 especially the common newt, and       
 another species which is known locally
 as a 'salamander'. Newts can also be  
 found in Brierton quarry. The streams 
 also contain frogs as well as a number
 of small fish. The stickleback is     
 fairly common, together with another  
 fish locally known as a 'catfish'.    
 Grass snakes have been seen beside the
 stream but they are fairly rare.
