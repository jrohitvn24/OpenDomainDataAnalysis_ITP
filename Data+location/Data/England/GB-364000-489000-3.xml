		<content>      Birks Mill is an egg-packing     
 station which was expanded to         
 accomodate a thriving frozen food     
 business.  Near the mill is Birks     
 village whose recent occupants, many  
 of whom are professional people       
 working at the public school, have    
 renovated the properties.             
      On the Kendal road out of        
 Sedbergh to the west is Close's       
 Garage, one of five garages which     
 serve the Sedbergh motorist.  The     
 owner considers his business to be    
 quite secure in an area where the car 
 is a necessity rather than a luxury.  
      Further out on the Kendal road is
 the{Old Station}which had two sidings 
 until its closure in 1964.  The       
 premises continue to be used as a coal
 yard.  Over a 25 mile radius this yard
 delivers 40,000 tons of coal every    
 year.                                 </content>
