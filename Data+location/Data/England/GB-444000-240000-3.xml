		<content>  Marlborough Road Methodist Church was
built in 1860. The Parish Church is St.
Mary's. It is in the Horsefair. It has 
a big dome roof. St.Paul's is another  
Church of England, also St.Leonard's   
and St.Hugh's.                         
  Ruscote is a Methodist Church in the 
Fairway. Grimsbury Methodist was       
knocked down so they use St.Leonard's  
until a new one is built.              
  There is a Baptist Church at         
Horsefair and a Friends' Meeting House 
as well. St. John's is a Roman Catholic
Church in South Bar. The United Reform 
Church is in South Bar too. St.Joseph's
is another R.C. Church.                
  The Mosque is a house in Castle      
Street. The Muslims meet there. There  
are also some Sikhs - mainly in        
Grimsbury.                             
 The Mormons meet on Cherwell Heights. 
 The Brethren meet on Kingsway.        </content>
