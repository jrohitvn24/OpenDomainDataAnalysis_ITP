		<title>11BATTLE QUINCENTENARY</title>
		<content> Throughout the summer of 1985 a       
 variety of events were staged to      
 commemorate the 500th anniversary of  
 the Battle of Bosworth.  The          
 festivites were opened on 27th July,  
 by their Royal Highnesses, the Prince 
 and Princess of Wales.                
 Each Sunday throughout the summer was 
 nominated as a special event day and  
 the events included Trial by Combat,  
 Archery Tournaments, Jousting and on  
 the 22nd August, a full scale         
 re-enactment of the battle itself.    
 Quite apart from the spectacle of     
 knights in armour there were also     
 numerous lectures on mediaeval        
 history, the battle and warfare and   
 armoury of the period together with a 
 mediaeval banquet, performances of    
 Shakespeare's Richard 111 and a       
 memorial service on the morning of    
 Quincentenary Day.                    </content>
