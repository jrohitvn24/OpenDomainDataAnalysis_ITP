		<content> There are three main religious groups 
 represented in the town. The Church of
 England has recently built a new      
 Parish Rooms building adjacent to St. 
 Thomas' church which was built in the 
 12th. century,but largely rebuilt in  
 1862.It occupies the site of a Norman 
 church next to the Market Place in the
 centre of the town.The church also    
 runs the Crusader Union meetings for  
 youngsters (5-18).The Roman Catholic  
 church,Holy Rood, is a 19th. century  
 building set in beautiful wooded      
 surroundings. This church has a large 
 following and also provides           
 instruction for the younger church    
 members.The Methodist Chapel has a    
 commanding situation  with imposing   
 columns. It was built in the 1880's   
 next to the Railway Station. There is 
 also a Salvation Army group,which is  
 very active in the community.         </content>
