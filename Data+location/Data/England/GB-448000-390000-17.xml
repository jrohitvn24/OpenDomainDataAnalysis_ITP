 which his father built in 1926, the   
 year of the General Strike.           
{ He begins his day at 4.30am.}He will 
 deliver milk and other dairy products 
 like butter, yoghurt, and eggs, door

 hours on the days he collects money   
 from his customers.                   
{ He and his 2 sons deliver 2000       
{pint bottles a day.}The milk he sells
