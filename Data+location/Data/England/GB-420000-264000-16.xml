		<title>16My hobbies - horse riding</title>
		<content> My hobby is horse riding and we go to 
 Lane Farm every Friday night after    
 school  You need a{saddle}and a       
{bridle,}the{saddle}goes on the back of
 the horse and the{girth}is attached to
 the saddle.  The{stirrups}are where   
 you put your feet in and the{bridle}is
 put on the horse's head.  You need a  
 hat because if you fall off you may   
 get badly hurt.  The lesson costs Â£3. 
 To get a horse going you have to kick 
 it very hard.  i like it when we jump 
 and canter.  I like horses because    
 when you canter the wind goes in your 
 face.  But when it rains it is        
 horrible because all the rain goes in 
 your face and it gets through your    
 clothes.                              
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
