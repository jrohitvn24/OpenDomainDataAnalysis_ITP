		<content>    The mediaeval house at Godinton was
 owned by the Goldwell family.The Toke 
 family took over the house from the   
 Goldwells in the 1480's.The house was 
 altered and extended by Nicholas Toke 
 in 1627 and has changed very little   
 since 1630.                           
 The house contains many rooms in which
 there is carved wood panelling.There  
 are many pieces of valuable antique   
 furniture and collections of antique  
 china.                                
 In the early 19th. century John Toke  
 laid out a formal pleasure garden     
 which has been preserved inside a     
 continous yew hedge,planted in 1904.  
 The Toke family owned the house and   
 estate until 1896.It now belongs to   
 Mr.Alan Wyndham Green.                
 Part of the old Godinton Park was sold
 for the building of the new Godinton  
 Park housing estate.                  </content>
