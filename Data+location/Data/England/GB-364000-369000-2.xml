		<content> My mum and dad own a sub-post office. 
 There are a number of duties a        
 postmaster has to do.For instance,he  
 has to sel postage stamps and savings 
 certificates;pay out child benefit    
 allowances;issue milk tokens,dog      
 licenses,travellers' cheques,etc.     
   A balance of the documents and money
 takes place every Friday.If the money 
 is wrong,the difference has to come   
 from the postmasters own pocket.      
 Toughened glass and metal bars are    
 around the counters to prevent theft. 
   We also have a shop-side where we   
 see chemist sundries(e.g. toothpaste  
 and soap),stationary,tobacco,greetings
 cards and confectionary.              
   The post office is open every day   
 except Sunday.                        
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
