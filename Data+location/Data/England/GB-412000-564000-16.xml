		<title>16THROCKLEY FIRST SCHOOL.</title>
		<content>    Throckley First School was opened  
 in{1972}and was a purpose-built       
 open-plan school. In{1974}when boundry
 changes came into force the school    
 became part of Newcastle upon Tyne    
 area instead of Northumberland.       
    It is situated a short distance    
 south of the main West Road from      
 Newcastle to Carlisle and the{"vallum"
 which dates from Roman times gives the
 name to one of the school buildings.  
    Most of the children enjoy living  
 in Throckley and appreciate the nearby
 facilities and the open spaces which  
 enable them to play out of doors.     
    Many people take great care of     
 their gardens and in 1985 the school  
 and the area have made a every effort 
 to make Throckley a worthy contestant 
 for{"Britain in Bloom".
