		<title>06Farming in 1985 (1)</title>
		<content> We interviewed{a young farmer,Paul    
{Fearn}of Handley Fields Farm,who said:
  Farming has become more{mechanised   
 now because of machines like combine  
 harvesters.  Farmers do not need to   
 employ much casual labour.{Sprays}are 
 used to kill all the weeds and a high 
 rate of{fertiliser}is used. Since the 
 1960's cattle have been de-horned to  
 prevent them from damaging one        
 another.                              
{ Milking}is more efficient now. The   
 milking parlour and cubicle mean that 
 more cows can be milked an hour and   
 less time is spent carrying equipment 
 and cleansing. Cows give more milk    
 now and there is bulk collection with 
 a tanker calling every morning. The   
 milk{quality controls}have made it    
 difficult for young farmers to set up 
 in business. The 1983 output is taken 
 less 9% and this prevents expansion.  </content>
