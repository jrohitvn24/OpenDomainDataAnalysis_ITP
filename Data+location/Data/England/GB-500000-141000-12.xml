		<content>   Wonersh is the nearest village to   
 Bramley. Its main features are        
 Barnett Hill and Lynes Farm.          
   Barnett Hill is a unique treasure   
 trove and was bought by F.Cook in     
 1905. He bought 26 acres of land and  
 built a Queen Anne-style country      
 house for Â£35000. The French          
 tapestries and crystal chandeliers    
 still remain there today. After the   
 War the British Red Cross society     
 turned the house into its National    
 Training Centre.                      
   Lynes farm is owned by Commander    
 Farley forming part of the 250 - 300  
 acres that he owns. The residents of  
 Lynnes Farm grow barley and hay. There
 is a barn which dates back a long time
 and they are now building a cattery.  
   In the middle of Wonersh is a       
 square-roofed bus shelter called a    
 pepperpot.                            </content>
