		<title>17NORTH ROAD LADIES CLUB</title>
		<content> The Ladies Club has been in existence 
 for 17 years and has met monthly at   
 North Road School. It has about 30    
 members,half of these being founder   
 members.Over the past years the       
 Ladies Club has had mystery tours,    
 visits,skittles,treasure hunts &amp; a    
 barbecue,all extra to the monthly     
 meetings.Membership is Â£2 a year.     
 One of our most interesting speakers  
 was Mr Bullock of Radio Bristol on    
 antiques,and the ladies brought       
 antiques to be dated and valued.A     
 coffee evening and fashion show       
 raised over Â£100 for the charity      
 "Break" holidays for the handicapped. 
 The County of Avon now want to double 
 the cost of the school,which may force
 us to disband.We have appealed,and    
 are still awaiting the outcome.
