		<content> Near the centre of Barnsley there is  
 Locke Park. The park is usually very  
 busy.  It is in a quiet part of the   
 town and is easily reached by bus. In 
 the park there is a popular playground
 and a trim trail, cafe, bandstand and 
 bowling green.                        
 Also in the town there is an art      
 gallery, a modern library, a cinema, a
 small theatre and an old swimming     
 baths. The town hall is in the very   
 centre of Barnsley. It is a busy area 
 with a variety of shops both modern   
 and old. Many are in a newly          
 landscaped pedestrian precinct.       
 Surrounding the town are areas of     
 mixed housing, small factories and    
 land reclamation schemes designed to  
 improve the image and facilities of   
 Barnsley.
