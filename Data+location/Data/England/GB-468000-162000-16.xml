		<content>  Apart from farming the majority      
 of work is either in the village or on
 the Duke of Wellington's estate. This,
 however is not enough to employ the   
 population of the village (438),      
 therefore most of the people commute  
 to  Reading for work.                 
{                                      
{Farming                               
 There are nine farms, but they are    
 small and do not need many workers.   
 The largest, 'Home Farm', employs     
 fifteen workers.                      
{                                      
{Work On The Estate                    
 The Duke of Wellington hires a number 
 of helpers, but these helpers need to 
 be specialized and usually come from  
 elsewhere.                            
                                       
 There is very little employment in    
 the{village.                          </content>
