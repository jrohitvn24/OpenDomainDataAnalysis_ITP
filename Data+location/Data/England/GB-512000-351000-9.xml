 enough,they went into partnership.The 
 company has 18 trucks which includes  
 14 tractor units with 24 trailers,8 of
 which are refridgerated,&amp; 4 rigids.At 
 the moment 24 people work there.The   
 trailers are mainly used for taking   
 local produce to markets at           
 London,Manchester,Liverpool and       
 Birmingham.The trailers usually carry 
 potatoes and other vegetables.Chickens
 are also taken to a local poultry     
 processing unit,and frozen ones taken 
 to supermarkets.Seed potatoes are     
 also brought down from Scotland in the
 winter.The company does all it's
