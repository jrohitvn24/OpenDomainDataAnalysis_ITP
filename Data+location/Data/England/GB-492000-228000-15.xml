 BUTCHER SHOP RAIDS; Three local       
 butchers in the Leighton area were    
 counting the cost of the latest series
 of attacks on their shops by animal   
 liberation campaigners.  The          
 protesters claim that annimals are    
 suffering to provide food and that    
 butchers are responsible.             
                                       
 NEW HEATING FOR WOBURN ABBEY; A       
 heating system designed to slash the  
 fuel bill costs for heating Woburn    
 Abbey has been instaled.  The system  
 uses boilers that burn waste straw    
 from the estate instead of expesnive  
 fuel oil.  Savings of up to Â£30,000 a 
 year are predicted.
