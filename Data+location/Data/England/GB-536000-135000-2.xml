		<title>02EAST GRINSTEAD HOUSING</title>
		<content> This block encompasses great contrast 
 in housing styles. In the High St well
 preserved 14C houses still stand      
 behind their narrow facades. 15, 16 &amp; 
 17C timber framed houses have become  
 shops and offices. In Portland Rd     
 Edwardian houses are rarely available,
 but many take in lodgers. West Lane   
 has secluded character properties     
 always in demand at the highest       
 prices. Around dunnings Rd smaller    
 houses of the 1920s &amp; 30s often have  
 their original occupants, whilst      
 others have been modernised by Do It  
 Yourself enthusiasts. At Herontye the 
 builders won awards for their modern  
 design. Even the plants in the front  
 gardens were planned. The 1970s flats 
 &amp; 2 bedroom houses sell for around    
 $46000 while some 4 bedroom executive 
 detached houses can reach $95000.
