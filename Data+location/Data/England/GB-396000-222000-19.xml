		<title>19REVIEW OF THE BLOCK 1</title>
		<content> BECAUSE THE BLOCK COVERS AN AREA WHICH
 INCLUDES BOTH{TOWN AND COUNTRYSIDE,   
{CONTRASTS ARE GREAT}WITHIN THE SPACE  
 OF A FEW MILES. TEN KILOMETRE_SQUARES 
 OF THE BLOCK ARE RURAL WITH THE VAST  
 MAJORITY OF THE POPULATION LIVING     
 WITHIN THE TWO URBAN SQUARES. THE     
 RURAL AREA IS POPULATED WITH PEOPLE   
 WHO ARE EITHER INVOLVED IN{FARMING}OR 
 ARE ABLE TO{AFFORD PROPERTY}ON THE    
 COTSWOLD EDGE. THE VILLAGE OF         
 PRESTBURY AND THE BATTLEDOWN          
 RESIDENTIAL AREA CONTAIN SOME         
{EXPENSIVE PROPERTIES}WHILST MUCH OF   
 THE REMAINDER CONSISTS OF             
{COUNCIL_OWNED HOUSING.} G.C.H.Q. IS   
 EASILY THE{LARGEST EMPLOYER}AND THERE 
 ARE A NUMBER OF SMALL FACTORIES MAINLY
 ALONG BOUNCERS LANE. THERE IS A VERY  
 DISTINCT CONTRAST BETWEEN THE{LIFE    
{STYLES}OF PEOPLE IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF
 THE AREA.                             </content>
