		<title>10Wildlife in Lawshall Area.</title>
		<content>The wildlife in this area is very good.
There is a herd of roe deer roaming    
from Frithy Wood to Chadacre Wood.     
Countless colonies of  bats, plenty    
of foxes,inspite of the local hunt!    
Rabbits,hares,grey squirrels,hedgehogs,
stoats,weasels,rats,mice,voles,shrews. 
Plenty of butterflies, most common are:
Red Admiral,Peacock,Small Tortoiseshell
Large Whites and Orange Tips. Moths,   
dragonflies,damselflies, plenty of pond
life, water voles, excellent frog,toad 
and newt breading grounds. There is a  
local pond well stocked for fishing,   
with carp(mirror,crusian,common,and    
golden) rudd, roach, tench, although   
the farmer who owns it, specifies that 
it is for village residents use only,  
and all fish must be returned to the   
pond.Bird spotting too, is very reward-
ing in this area. On a recent survey,  
80 different species were recorded.    </content>
