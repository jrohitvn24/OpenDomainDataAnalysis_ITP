		<content> This is not an industrial area,       
 however, there are a few small        
 factories and several warehouse and   
 processing establishments.  There are 
 also several office blocks.  The      
 industrial/commercial area is confined
 to the Houndsmill Industrial Estate,  
 part of which is in our grid. The     
 industrial area makes up less than one
 twelfth of the grid. By far the most  
 important activitiy is that of        
 warehousing and distribution. This    
 obviously reflects the proximity to   
 the motorways, both east/west (M4) and
 east/south (M3). It must therefore    
 reflect the ease of access to London, 
 Heathrow Airport(London Airport), and 
 Southampton Docks. The other          
 industrial activities can be          
 classified under light industrail     
 concerns making use of the pool of    
 skilled labour living in good housing.</content>
