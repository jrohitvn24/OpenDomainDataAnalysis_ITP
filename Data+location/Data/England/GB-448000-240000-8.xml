		<title>08A DAY IN THE LIFE OF ME</title>
		<content> Cont: We rush out into the playground 
to play soccer,  or skipping (mostly   
girls). When the whistle is blown we   
line up again, then walk into School.  
Between 11 oclock and 12 oclock we do  
language work and study English. Some  
-times I work from a book called "Bet  
-ter English Book Four". I enjoy my    
School dinner because eating is my     
favourite occupation. At 1:15p.m. we   
come in from the lunch break. Mr Allen 
tells us what we are going to do for   
the rest of the day. After the after   
-noon break we often have P.E. I enjoy 
athletics. On many days Mr Allen will  
read us a story or part of one. My sch 
-ool day ends at 3:40p.m. when I catch 
the taxi back to Purston. When I get   
home I like to watch T.V. At 5:00p.m.  
my dad comes in. I like to have a bath 
at the end of the day. I go to bed at  
about 9:00p.m.                         </content>
