		<content>{Electricity.}Two years ago an         
 aerogenerator was installed (with the 
 help of a helicopter).It cost Â£40,000 
 but is fully automatic and when there 
 is sufficient wind it takes over from 
 the diesel generators.Most of the     
 houses now have storage heaters to    
 take advantage of the electricity     
 which is now free.(However the new    
 distribution system and fittings cost 
 a further Â£100,000).If more than 55   
 KW.are produced a set of grey boxes   
 dissipate the heat and in exceptional 
 winds there are flaps on the rotars   
 which operate to prevent damage.Wind  
 speed and power production can be     
 viewed in comfort on dials in the     
 Tavern.{Bottled Gas.}Imported bottled 
 gas is used for cookers and 'fridges. 
{Diesel.}As with the gas (and most     
 things on Lundy)this comes via the    
 Polar Bear and a long pull.           </content>
