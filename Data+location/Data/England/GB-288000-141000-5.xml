		<title>05Study of East Water</title>
		<content>  The East Water runs into a marsh     
 near Stoke Pero.Near Cloutsham we     
 took various water samples.The Ph     
 scale of the water was 7.5.This       
 makes East Water Alkaline;we think    
 this is because of the rocky          
 bottom.What happened was that the     
 water ran over the lime and so the    
 water turned Alkaline.The East Water  
 is not very deep or wide.The deepest  
 place we studied was about 1.6ft.     
 deep.The river in some places was     
 16ft. wide.
