		<title>06Harpenden Carnival</title>
		<content> On 19th May it was Carnival Day.   It 
 was a day when everybody got together 
 to raise money for charity.   The main
 organisation was done by the          
 Roundtable but the procession was     
 organised by the Rotary Club.   The   
 theme for the carnival was dragons and
 devils.  To lead the procession, there
 was a brass band and after that there 
 were lots of floats and dragons.   One
 of the dragons was made out of lots of
 different coloured sheets with a      
 beautiful Chinese dragon head.        
                                       
 At the carnival there was a helter-   
 skelter, a fun castle, lots of stalls 
 and a fire engine for children to go  
 on.   Thousands of people were there  
 and lots of money was raised.  The    
 money is going towards an adventure   
 playground for children in Harpenden  
 and to aid autistic children.         </content>
