		<content>{Points of Interest.}The house at the  
 corner of Church St. and High St. is  
 probably the oldest in the village. It
 was the original{Court House}for the  
 district.                             
 Opposite it is{Sawpit Bank,}but the   
 Sawpit has now been filled in. The    
 village stocks stood here, and there  
 was a small cell dug out of the bank  
 which served as a lock-up.{The Rope   
{Walk}runs from the south side of the  
 Ludlow road at the Todding to Kinton  
 Lane. The hut used by the Ropemaker   
 can still be seen at the top end.{    
{Leintwardine House}was once the       
 residence of{General Sir Banastre     
{Tarleton,}of interest to Americans on 
 account of his connection with the    
 American War of Independence. General 
 Tarleton is buried in the Churchyard  
 and a Wall Monument to his memory is  
 set in a Side Chapel of the Church.   </content>
