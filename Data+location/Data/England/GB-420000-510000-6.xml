		<title>06THE 'UNITED FREE GARDENERS'</title>
		<content>   A{Lodge of the United Free Gardeners
 was established in  Aldbrough in 1847.
 It  went  under  the  title  of {'The 
{Blooming  Rose  of  Stanwick'} and its
 secretary  was one  {Thomas Gent Esq.,
 who lived  at  the {Stanwick Arms} and
 whose  occupation  was  given  as     
 victualler and farmer.  The membership
 in  1890  was 100.  These are the only
 known  facts  about  the  organisation
 that it has so far  proved possible to
 establish. What its activities or aims
 were we do not know,  nor is there any
 record its being disbanded or replaced
 by any other  local  horticultural  or
 gardening society.
