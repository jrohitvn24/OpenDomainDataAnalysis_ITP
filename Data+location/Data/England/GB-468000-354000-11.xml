		<content>  A DAY IN THE LIFE OF POLICE SERGEANT 
 MICHAEL PEAK                          
   On Sunday, 22nd September, the      
 annual church service of the{Multiple 
{Sclerosis Society}was held in         
 Southwell Minster.  It has held here  
 because it is the 25th anniversary of 
 the Mansfield Branch of the Society.  
   It was Sgt. Peak's job to keep the  
{traffic}under control, and to see that
 evrything went smoothly.  A few hours 
 before the service, Sgt. Peak briefed 
 the{policemen}on duty and also the    
{Special Constables.} Special          
 Constables are ordinary  citizens who 
 give their time voluntarily to help   
 the Police.  There main job this day  
 was to keep the traffic moving away   
 from the Minster for the arrival of   
 the many coaches.  The day passed     
 without incident.
