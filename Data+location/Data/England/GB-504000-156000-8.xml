		<content> There are three schools in Ripley, one
 being a private day-school for        
 boys. Other nearby schools, three in  
 Pyrford, lie just outside this Block  
 but there is a Horticultural Training 
 College in Wisley, described in a     
 Special Feature.                      
                                       
 Ockham has a Church Sunday School,    
 but its village school was closed in  
 1964. Special buses and private cars  
 transport the children. Some older    
 children  go away to boarding school. 
 Later, many children go on to higher  
 education outside the area.
