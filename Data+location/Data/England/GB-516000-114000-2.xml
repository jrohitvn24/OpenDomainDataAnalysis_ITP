{Ashurst}is a little village with not  
 many people.  There is one pub, the   
 Fountain.  There is one telephone box,
 one pillar box, a twelfth century     
 church, only six council houses.  The 
 rest are private and some have beams. 
 There are no shops, we have to go to  
 Partridge Green or Steyning for       
 shopping.  There is a playground but  
 its only got a swing frame and a sand 
 pit.  There is a small school, only   
 two classrooms, a small swimming pool 
 and one computor and about three      
 teachers.  About 30 children in the   
 juniors and more in the infants.
