 I like Westbury Park,our old house was
 much smaller but the one here is      
 enormous! Now we can go to clubs eg   
 ice skating ,art club ,country        
 dancing. I live much nearer the school
 my friends and the shops.We can walk  
 to all of them we live near our       
 relations eg.Our grannies,our great   
 uncle and our aunts and uncles.I also 
 like Westbury Park because it doesn't 
 have smoky factories.It is not all    
 dirty but it is a pretty place to live
 in.I also like it because the edge of 
 the Downs is in Westbury Park.You can 
 go bike riding on the paths.I'm glad I
 live in Westbury Park.
