		<title>10The Brass Band - Kirton</title>
		<content> On the Wednesday night when I first   
 joined Kirton Band we all squeezed    
 into the bandroom at the back of the  
 'Stag and Pheasant' Public House car  
 park.During the evening they took our 
 names and any important imformation   
 such as any previous musical          
 knowledge.Later we were given our     
 instruments and I received a large    
 one called a Euphonium. I tried to    
 blow my Euphonium and I got a horrible
 noise!I took it home that evening and 
 as I practised that week the noise    
 grew better.The next band evening we  
 started blowing notes and from then we
 have progressed to our present        
 standard.                             
   Now there are sixteen junior band   
 members and ten adult bandsmen.The    
 older members are very patient and    
 helpful;they have to be for most of   
 the time somebody has a sticky valve! </content>
