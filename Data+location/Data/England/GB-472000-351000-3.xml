		<title>03How do we get about ?</title>
		<content> The principal means of transport in   
 the area is the{motor vehicle,}with   
 almost all families having access to  
 one car. Most have two. Main roads are
 two-lane and most of the others are   
 single-track, metalled.{Bus services  
 run through Rolleston and Fiskerton on
 the Newark to Mansfield via Southwell 
 route and through Fiskerton and Morton
 on the Southwell to Nottingham route. 
 Although some famillies depend upon   
 these sevices, they are not heavily   
 used. A{school bus}service is provided
 to Southwell. The{railway}line has    
 unmanned passenger stations at        
 Fiskerton and Rolleston used by a few 
 city commuters. Deisel trains also    
 haul coal and oil. No goods are       
 delivered to the area via these       
 stations.{Bicycles}are widely used for
 door to door deliveries, shopping and 
 recreation.                           </content>
