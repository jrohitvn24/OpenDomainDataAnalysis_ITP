		<title>14Employment in Alvechurch.</title>
		<content>   In Alvechurch in the 1940's, the    
 population was under 2000 people. Not 
 all of them needed employment, some   
 were retired, and some were children. 
 Today, the population of the village  
 stands at around 3500, with           
 proportionately higher level of       
 employment age. Then most of the      
 people worked in the Needle Factory in
 Redditch, or producing cars in the    
 Austin factories in Longbridge. If    
 not, perhaps producing fishing tackle,
 nuts and bolts, or springs. These     
 factories were also in the area or    
 quite near, and so many people        
 including farmers and shop keepers,   
 then worked in Alvechurch. Alvechurch,
 now a dormitory town, houses          
 commuters, teachers, farmers,         
 shopkeepers and health service people 
 work here. Delsons, H.Kedward Ltd and 
 Project Engineering thrive.           </content>
