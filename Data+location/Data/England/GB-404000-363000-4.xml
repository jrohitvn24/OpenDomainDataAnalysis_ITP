		<title>04Farming in Heathylee</title>
		<content>     There are dairy and beef cows,    
sheep, hens, pigs and goats in         
Heathylee.  There is a mixture of      
grazing, rough pasture, meadow,        
moorland, pasture and marsh.  The land 
is used to keep animals intensively on 
the lower areas and extensively on the 
moorland.                              
     There is much moorland because the
ground is high up and so it is wet and 
cold and the ground becomes covered    
with peat.  Heather and bilberry grow  
on this where the drainage is good but 
cotton grass and rushes grow in the    
wetter areas.                          
     There are about 11 months winter  
and one month of bad weather in        
Heathylee: most farmers now make       
silage because the weather in summer   
often spoils the hay.  Many farmers    
are now using big bale silage, wrapped 
in polythene bags.                     </content>
