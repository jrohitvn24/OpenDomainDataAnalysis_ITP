		<content> A house to house survey was carried   
 out and this is what we found out.    
 Most people live in semi _ detached   
 houses or bungalows. There are some   
 detached houses,chalets and terraced  
 houses.  Most have been built during  
 the last 30 years. There are 6 or 7   
 houses which are over 100 years old.  
 Some are 200, 300, or even 400 years  
 old.                                  
 Some of the older houses are called   
 Barling House,Myrtle Cottage,Ruckins  
 Farm, Bolts Farm and Glebe Farm. This 
 used to be the vicarage.
