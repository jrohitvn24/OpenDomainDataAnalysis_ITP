		<content> There is evidence that some of the    
 woodland is used for shooting, a Game 
 Keeper is employed to maintain it. In 
 the summer months small areas are made
 available for camping and caravaning, 
 near farms or public houses which     
 provide water and toilet facilities.  
 The reservoir at Barcombe is available
 for fishing and the River Ouse at     
 Barcombe Mills is used for boating by 
 both the public and organisations such
 as the Guides and Scouts. Lawn Mower  
 races, a recent innovation, are held  
 at the 'Half_way House' at Rose Hill. 
 Bed and breakfast accomodation is     
 available  at the 'Chapelfield Motel' 
 and riding stables are maintained near
 the 'Old Ship'.
