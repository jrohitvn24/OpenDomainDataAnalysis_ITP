		<title>02Villages and Settlements.</title>
		<content> There are few settlements apart from  
 the 2 hamlets of Limerstone, situated 
 about the farm, Yafford about the     
 mill; there is one village, Shorwell, 
 situated at the foot of the Downs     
 along the spring line. Its junction of
 roadways link the village with the    
 others along the same south facing    
 slopes and, via Shorwell Shute, with  
 the northern half of the Island. As a 
 service centre for its rural          
 environment there is the church, a    
 chapel, the post office, a general    
 store and a public house. In Shorwell 
 is a youth club and a builder's yard. 
 The houses are a mixture of local     
 stone, thatched cottages, villa type  
 modern houses, bungalows and some     
 council house. The village is on a bus
 route. Some inhabitants work on local 
 farms but most work elsewhere (mainly 
 Newport) or are retired.              </content>
