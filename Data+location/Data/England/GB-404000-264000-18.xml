		<title>18Home Computer Survey.</title>
		<content>  Over the past few years home         
 computers have become extremely       
 popular.Many homes now have a computer
 and these are used in a variety of    
 ways,but mainly for games.            
  Our survey showed that in our school,
 Moatfield,{178}out of{600 children}   
 i.e.{approx 30%}had a computer.There  
 were{15 types of computer}and the most
 popular of these was the{ZX Sinclair  
{Spectrum}followed by the{CBM Vic 20.} 
 These models cost in the region of{   
{Â£100,}though prices are falling as the
 market has become saturated.Most      
 computers were attached to {cassette  
{recorders.}These were found to be slow
 at loading programs and while being   
 sufficient for games were too         
 slow for more complicated programs.   
 Most children bought their software   
 from{W.H.Smith.}The most popular game 
 was{Daley Thompson's Decathlon.       </content>
