		<content> Walton is set in an area of pastoral  
farming which is mainly set aside for  
DAIRY FARMING.  The western end of the 
survey area is particularly rural and  
includes several dairy farms.          
 An interesting feature of the western 
edge of the block is that of the land  
which belongs to the experimental farm 
located in the adjacent 12 km. block. A
variety of unusual breeds can be seen  
in the fields.                         
 Much of the survey area is a mixture  
of light industry, housing, and land   
given over to farming.                 
 Three major features that are found   
in the area are; the M.6. motorway, the
River Trent, and the Trent and Mersey  
Canal.  The latter feature once had the
company H.Q. based in nearby Stone.    
 There three centres of population, the
village of Aston, Little Stoke and the 
housing estate of Walton.              </content>
