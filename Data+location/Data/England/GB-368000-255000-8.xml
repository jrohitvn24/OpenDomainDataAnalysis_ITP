		<content> I am Chris Woods and I live with my   
 parents at 'The Gaines'.Life today is 
 very exiting because we have a new    
 canoeing lake and a new roller skating
 track.The guests can play putting,foot
 ball,hockey and cricket.The land      
 covers about five acres.Guest don't   
 just come from{England},they also come
 from{France,West Germany,Austria,     
{Poland,Finland,America}and{Canada.    
 It has changed by having a new        
 consenatory and the swimming pool.Also
 some of out buildings have been       
 converted into houses.The main change 
 is since{1962,}it is a Christian Youth
 Centre,before it used to be a family  
 home.The house was started to be built
 in{1670}and it was finished in{1713.  
 The man who had it built was John     
 Freeman,who was a Bristol Merchant.The
 house stayed in the Freeman family    
 until about{1920.                     </content>
