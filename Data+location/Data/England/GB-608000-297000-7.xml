		<title>07FARMING - MACHINERY</title>
		<content> Eight men plus one student from Easton
 agricultural college work on the farm.
 Up to 1950 30 men were employed. Five 
 live on the farm and three in their   
 own accomodation.                     
 Mr Alston has a wide range of modern  
 machinery, though he has 2 Allis      
 Chalmers tractors from pre-war days   
 tucked away! Today, however, 80% of   
 farm machinery comes from abroad.     
 The machinery includes two combines   
 and two Massey diggers to clean       
 ditches and to load corn and          
 fertiliser. There is a hedge-trimmer, 
 sprayer, a large American John Deere  
 tractor, a French sugar beet          
 harvester, two British ploughs and a  
 1941 tractor! A modern lorry is used 7
 months of the year taking beet to Bury
 St Edmunds and grain to Diss, Ipswich 
 and Yarmouth. Feed barley is exported 
 to East Germany and Russia.           </content>
