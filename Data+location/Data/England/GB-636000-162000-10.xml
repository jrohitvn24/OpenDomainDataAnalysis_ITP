		<title>10FARMING IN RURAL RAMSGATE</title>
		<content>Farms in the district are all arable   
ones.The crops grown are wheat,early   
potatoes,barley,cauliflowers and a     
variety of other crops such as oil-    
seed rape.There is no pasture land,    
only large hedgeless fields.The farmers
are able to get two crops each year    
from their fields due to rich soil and 
mild,dry climate.Permanent staffs on   
farms are small and there is a great   
dependence on seasonal workers         
especially during the summer.In this   
area,the land is mostly fifty or more  
metres above sea-level and is well     
drained. There is no surface water of  
any kind. Each farmer has his own      
fleet of tractors,with attachments for 
ploughing,drilling and spraying,and his
own combine harvester.Barley is        
harvested in May and July,wheat in     
August;potatoes picked in June and     
cauliflowers cut in June and November. </content>
