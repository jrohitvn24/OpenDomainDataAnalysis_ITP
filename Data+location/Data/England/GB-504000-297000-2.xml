		<title>02WANSFORD VILLAGE</title>
		<content>  Wansford is a quiet and beautiful    
 village about half a mile long. It is 
 based around its main street and      
 spreads over the bridge. Terraced     
 cottages built from stone dominate    
 this road. In Wansford there are two  
 pubs and one large hotel. The names of
 the pubs are THE PAPERMILLS and THE   
 CROSS KEYS. The hotel is called THE   
 HAYCOCK. For such a small village this
 is unusual and suggests that visitors 
 from the surrounding area and from off
 the A1 use it.                        
  There is a post Office and two       
 antique shops selling a number of old 
 and valuable items. There is a church 
 in Wansford and a Methodist           
 Chapel. There is a butchers shop on   
 the corner of some houses. There  are 
 between 100 and 150 houses in         
 Wansford.
