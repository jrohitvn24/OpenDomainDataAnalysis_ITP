		<title>09SOCIAL   LIFE  IN   YANWORTH</title>
		<content>     The{social centre}for the  village
 is  the{Stowell Park Social Club}based
 in what was once the{old Reading Room.
     Membership  is  not  restricted to
 those  living or working on  the  farm
 estate  and the social activities mean
 Yanworth has  more to offer than other
 villages.   With  younger farm workers
 coming onto the estate in the last ten
 years  and  often from  a  non farming
 background the club helps to keep  the
 the idea of a village community.   The
 club means a lot to the older people. 
   { Bingo}is a monthly attraction  and
 the{youth club}meets every Monday. The
{Social Club }itself  is  held on three
 nights a week  and  Saturday  night is
 for{Stowell Park Cricket Club.        
     Appropriately in this farming area
 the{Harvest  Festival  Supper }is  one
 important  village  event organised by
 the club.                             </content>
