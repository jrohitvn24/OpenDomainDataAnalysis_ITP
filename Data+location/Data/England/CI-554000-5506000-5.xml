		<title>05Fishing in Alderney</title>
		<content> The waters around Alderney are        
 full of many species of fish.Most     
 of the commercial fishing though      
 is involved in shellfish.The          
 average catch per pot per week is     
 70.The boats go out two times a       
 day.The boats do not go potting on    
 spring tides.Fish is sold in          
 France,to hotels, restaurants and to  
 the general public.There is one       
 trawler, a beam trawler. The sort of  
 shell fish caught are crab and        
 lobster. Fishing is also done by long 
 line,hand line and netting.There are  
 28 potters (not all full-time)in the  
 harbour but there are only 10 working 
 trotters and netters. Some boats have 
 their  own fish wells on board,others 
 have store pots anchored to mooring   
 buoys in the harbour.
