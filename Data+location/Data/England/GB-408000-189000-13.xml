		<title>13RELIGION,PURTON STOKE</title>
		<content> A public meeting place was set up by  
 the{Quakers}in Purton Stoke.On 14th   
 October 1721 Amy Davis married        
 William Absleep there.From detailed   
 records of births,marriages and       
 burials we can discover the names of  
 some of the villagers who supported   
 that cause.They include Shurmer,      
 Thomas,Fitchew,Messenger,Fisher,      
 Carter,Bath,Waine and Sallis.The site 
 of the meeting place is thought to be 
 where number 22 is now along Water    
 Lane,and their burial ground was at   
 number 38.                            
                                       
 Over 100 years later in 1832 Purton   
 Stoke Society built a {Methodist      
 Chapel for Â£160 opposite the present  
 shop on land bought from Jonas Bathe. 
 In 1868 it was decided to move to     
 another site and so the building was  
 pulled down.                          </content>
