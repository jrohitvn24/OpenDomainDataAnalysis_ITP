		<title>11A schoolboy's week</title>
		<content>  Nick is ten and lives in Tetchill. He
 attends Ellesmere primary school since
 there is no school in Tetchill.       
  On most mornings he gets  up at seven
 although it may be  earlier in summer.
 The  school bus  should collect him at
 0845 although it is often late. In the
 evenings he gets home at 1550. He  may
 play adventure games with friends  but
 otherwise watches TV or plays  on  the
 family's  computer. Until recently  he
 went to Ellesmere cubs on Thursdays.He
 or his sister takes the dog for a walk
 and, during the summer,he helps in the
 garden. He  goes  to  bed  about  nine
 o'clock.On Saturdays he again plays on
 the computer but  occasionally  he  is
 taken with a friend to watch Liverpool
 FC. On Sunday mornings and evenings he
 goes to  Ellesmere parish church where
 he sings in the choir.In the afternoon
 he is content to laze or garden!      </content>
