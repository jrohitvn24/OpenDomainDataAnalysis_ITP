		<content>   In a recent survey conducted by the 
 Parish Council it was found that most 
 residents are satisfied with the      
 services available.                   
   Some people felt the need for mains 
 gas,a pre-school playgroup and a      
 petrol station(the previous one having
 closed when the by-pass was built).   
   The by-pass was initially unpopular 
 but is now accepted because it diverts
 all but local traffic.                
   The amenities and shops in the      
 village are well used and bread,milk, 
 confectionary and newspapers are      
 delivered in the village.Some         
 residents expressed a dissatisfaction 
 with the lack of an appointment system
 at the Filey surgery.                 
   In conclusion it was felt that the  
 village was near enough to Filey and  
 Scarborough for additional needs.
