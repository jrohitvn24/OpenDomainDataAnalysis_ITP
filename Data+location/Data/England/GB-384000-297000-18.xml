		<title>18MY DAYS IN PERTON</title>
		<content>I have lived in Perton for six years   
now. When I moved here with my parents 
there was nothing here but houses. We  
went shopping in Telford and I went to 
a local  school. The Public Houses had 
not been built and there were no real  
places to go and play.                 
  When I first moved here I always     
wondered what the old buildings round  
the housing development were. At a     
later date I found out that some of    
them were Quarters for the soldiers. If
you look carefully you can still find  
pieces of the old runway in some       
gardens. On the edge of the Parkway    
there are still some of the old        
buildings remaining. Most of the       
buildings are common rubbish tips      
today or storage places for local      
farmers.
