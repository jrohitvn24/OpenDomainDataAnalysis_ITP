		<content>Much of the block is covered with clay 
deposited during the ice-age. During   
the 19th century the clay was dug and  
clay-pits dotted the area. One of them 
surives as a wood depression on the    
S.E. corner of the Fairway School      
grounds and Rednal Rd was called       
Marlpit Lane until the beginning of the
century. A path that leads south of    
Wychall lane can seen running through  
fields on old maps. This is now a      
tarmac path running though Fairway     
Estate known locally as the Black Path 
In places its old borader hedges still 
fourish. Some field boundaries are     
still traceable due to surviving hedges
and trees. Field and farm names have   
also surived e.g. Staple Lodge Rd (from
a farm and cottage) and Banktop        
Farmhouse is still standing Road names 
also  show that the land covered by    
Fairway Estate was a golf course.      </content>
