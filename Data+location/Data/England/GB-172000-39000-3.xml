		<content> My main interest is{B.M.X.Bikes.}I am 
 a ten year old girl. I have over one  
 hundred trophies. I started because my
 two older brothers were interested.   
 I have to wear a helmet with a face   
 guard and gloves and knee and elbow   
 pads. I  buy my equipment at Mousehole
 near Penzance.                        
 I went to Derby in 1984 and came      
 fourth in the{British Championships.} 
 A starter gets the riders ready by    
 saying "Set-em-up. Riders ready.      
 Pedals ready. Go!" There has to be a  
 person trained in first aid at events.
 Some events are jumping events.There  
 are quite a lot of jumps such as camel
 tops, step ups, speed jumps and       
 whoops!                               
 In June,1985 I travelled to           
 Birmingham. It was my first{National} 
 and I came first. I am going to Derby 
 and Birmingham later this year.       </content>
