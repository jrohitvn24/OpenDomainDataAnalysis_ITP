		<title>09A day in the life of .......</title>
		<content>Obviously people from all walks of life
live and work in Edenbridge. Some start
their day quite early (about 6 am).    
They all have busy days; they start by 
going through the mail and chasing rep-
resentatives. People with jobs of      
responsibility allocate their employees
their jobs for the day. There are tight
security checks made by the boses.     
Work for some finishes quite late      
(about 8.30pm).                        
People interviewed all got a chance to 
meet the public. Sometimes they have to
deal with the worse side of their jobs.
They all have a certain of competition.
There is always a lot of paper work to 
do, but technology is helping them,    
with such things like word-processors, 
computers,calculators etc., all of     
which are being introduced more and    
more into firms and shops.
