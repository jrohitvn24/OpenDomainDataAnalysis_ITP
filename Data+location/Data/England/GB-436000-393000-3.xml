		<title>03Farming In Thorpe Hesley.</title>
		<content> Farmers in our area have problems     
 which are caused by having farms      
 surrounded by housing estates.They    
 have difficulties with stray pets and 
 trespassers.There is also pollution   
 from the nearby coking plant.This     
 affects the pig's eyes at the pig     
 farm and to a lesser extent the crops.
 The farms in our area are mostly      
 dairy farms and they have been        
 affected by the cuts in milk quotas.  
 The animals are given injections to   
 keep them healthy.The worst diseases  
 are T.B.Brucellosis and Foot and      
 Mouth.The Ministry of Agriculture     
 takes blood samples from all cattle   
 every two years to check for these    
 diseases.Houses are being built on    
 good farming land which means that    
 farms cannot be extended.The farms in 
 our area do not use computers for     
 stock control.                        </content>
