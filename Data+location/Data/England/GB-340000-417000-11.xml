		<content>              Saturday                 
                                       
 I would get up at 7am, get my tennis  
 gear on, go downstairs for breakfast. 
 i would have a grapefruit and three   
 pieces of toast. I would watch TV     
 till; at 9.30am Tony's dad takes us to
 play tennis. At 12.30 my Mum would    
 pick us up from Southport and take up 
 home. I would have lunch of crisps,   
 hot dogs and a soft drink. After lunch
 I would go to Paul's house to see if  
 he was playing. We would play tennis  
 on his lawn till 4.30pm. When I get   
 home I would have a shower and watch  
 television. At 5.30pm I would have    
 chips, salad and hamburgers for       
 dinner. I would then watch TV till    
 8pm. I go to bed and read for an hour.
 At 9pm i would go to sleep.
