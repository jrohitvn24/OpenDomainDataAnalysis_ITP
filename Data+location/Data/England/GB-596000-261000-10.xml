		<title>10GRAVEL PITS</title>
		<content> Some of the gravel pits are still     
 worked. We saw gravel lorries, a      
 digger with caterpillar tracks,       
 elevators, a tractor and trailer, a   
 caravan and a cement mixer at a pit   
 near Woolpit. We saw a man drive away 
 a lorry load of sand. We were allowed 
 to go in, but we had to keep away from
 the edge of the pit.                  
 In Drinkstone there are disused gravel
 pits. We visited a two-acre pit owned 
 by Mr. Clarke. Rubbish is being dumped
 here because the old pit is deep and  
 dangerous and is no use. We saw all   
 kinds of rubbish, bricks, plaster,    
 mattresses, beds, cookers and garden  
 refuse. When the tip is full, top soil
 will be spread all over it. Then the  
 farmer hopes to re-seed the land, and 
 possibly use it to graze sheep.
