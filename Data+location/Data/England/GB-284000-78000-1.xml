		<content> The ancient wool town of Chudleigh    
 received its charter in 1309 and today
 has a population of approximately     
 2,500.  It lies astride the old main  
 road between Exeter and Plymouth and  
 was once a prominent coaching stop on 
 this route.  Ugbrooke House and park, 
 owned by Lord and Lady Clifford, is   
 located ne of Chudleigh and is open to
 the public between April and October. 
 The area is bisected n and s by the   
 River Teign and also by the new A38   
 trunk road.  In the nw corner of the  
 area is Trusham quarry and precast    
 concrete works, a major source of     
 employment in the area. The area has  
 numerous arable and dairy farms and   
 quite a bit of woodland. Commuting is 
 easy to both Exeter and Newton Abbot. 
 New houses are being built to         
 accommodate the floating population   
 for Newton Abbot and Exeter.          </content>
