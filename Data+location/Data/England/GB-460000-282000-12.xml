		<title>12NTH. KILWORTH'S AUTUMN FAYRE</title>
		<content>  The{Autumn Fayre}is held on the first
 Saturday in September. It has taken   
 place for ten years now is is becoming
 a tradition.                          
  For the first eight years it was held
 on the school field,but it  now takes 
 place in Church St..                  
  About twenty organisations in the    
 village take part .Some run stalls    
 selling things like cakes,ice         
 cream,lemonade or "White elephants".  
 Others run sideshows such as coconut  
 shy,rifle range,bottle stall,treasure 
 island or pony rides.                 
  Since taking to the street another   
 dimension has been added by having a  
 fancy dress theme. For 1985 this will 
 be the "20's" look.                   
  The profits which the Fayre makes are
 divided equally between the           
 participating groups.In 1984 the share
 was Â£60.                              </content>
