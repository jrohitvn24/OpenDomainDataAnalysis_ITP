		<title>04Findern school</title>
		<content>{Findern school}was built on {Buckford 
{Lane}in{1925}so that it could be      
 shared with the villages of{Stenson   
 and{Twyford.}Today people in the      
 village are worried about how far the 
 school is from the village.           
 There are plans that propose that a   
{motorway}will be built through the    
 village or more likely will pass      
 between the village and the school.The
 parents are concerned that it will be 
 dangerous for their children to walk  
 to school because they will have to   
 walk past the motorway.The children   
 could easily be knocked down by the   
 traffic. Parents are very worried, but
 there are no plans to build a new     
 school nearer to the the population.
