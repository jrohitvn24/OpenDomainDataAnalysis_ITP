<title>37THE RURAL LANDSCAPE</title>
<content>

The area is located within the Northamptonshire Uplands, characterised by rounded, undulating hills with many long, low ridgelines; wide views from the edges and across the ridge tops; little woodland, but prominent coverts on higher ground. The landscape is punctuated by nucleated villages, with Spratton and the two hamlets of Teeton and Holdenby within the square. Farming is mixed arable and pasture and, whilst this was previously determined by the very wide range of soil types, modern agricultural methods now allow the farmer to largely determines how his land is used. The landscape is enclosed by good hedges with frequent hedgerow trees which, in much of the area is unaltered from the time of its Enclosure, albeit some enclosure hedges has been removed within the last thirty years to make way for the larger farming equipment. There is a scattering of farmhouses and other dwellings outside the main village nuclei. Views from the east to the west are largely unspoilt, but the view from the ridge of the A5199 to the east is now affected by the increasing urban and commercial sprawl of Brixworth.   &lt;br />
