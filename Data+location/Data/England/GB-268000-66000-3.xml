		<title>03Housing in W. Buckfastleigh</title>
		<content> Various types of housing were found in
 the area. The village of Scorriton    
 consists largely of stone-built       
 cottages, but there are also about 20 
 council houses, a farmhouse, and a    
 popular inn, the{"Tradesman's Arms".  
 Michelcombe has several old cottages, 
 some of which date from the 15th      
 century. One of the cottages is let as
 holiday accommodation, and planning   
 permission has recently been granted  
 for the conversion of a barn for      
 holiday use.                          
                                       
 Of the larger properties, Brook House 
 is still occupied as one dwelling, but
 Hawson Court is divided into three:   
 the stable block is also separately   
 owned and used as racing stables.
