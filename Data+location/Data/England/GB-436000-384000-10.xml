		<title>10Don't Talk to Strangers</title>
		<content> Everyone has been very worried        
 recently about the number of children 
 who have been tempted into cars and   
 assaulted.                            
     Two girls from our school were    
 followed by a man in a car on their   
 way to school.                        
     The police and the local newspaper
 have started a campaign to warn       
 children about the dangers of         
 strangers who appear friendly but     
 could hurt them. They brought with    
 them a film and some leaflets.        
     Unfortunately, some of the younger
 children got rather excited, and got  
 into a right panic when a workman with
 a beard they had never seen before    
 walked into the school.               
     In fact, young children seem very 
 nervous of men with beards - even     
 though our teacher has one.
