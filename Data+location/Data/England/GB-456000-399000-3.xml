		<title>03POTTERIC CARR NATURE RESERVE</title>
		<content> It was during the 1960s that mining   
 subsidence altered the ecology of the 
 area making it an area of reedfen and 
 marsh attractive to wildlife. Since   
 1968 the{Yorkshire Naturalists Trust} 
 have had agreement with British Rail  
 to tenant Low Ellers Marsh. Despite   
 threats from the building of the M18  
 and railway reorganisation in the     
 1970s and 1980s they have managed to  
 extend the reserve and secure the     
 future of its{wildlife.}              
   The Reserve can be reached from the 
 A638 or the A630. There are car parks 
 at grid reference: SE598010 and       
 SE590007.                             
   There is a hide at Low Ellers and   
 the Bessacarr nature walk open to the 
 public. Balby Carr nature trail is    
 open to Trust members but other parts 
 of the reserve require a British Rail 
 walking permit.                       </content>
