		<title>02THE LANDSCAPE OF PARR.</title>
		<content>                                       
     The landscape, until recently has 
 been  badly scarred by the  Industrial
 Revolution  of  the  19th  century. In
 recent years spoil heaps from the coal
 and  chemical  industries  have  been 
 removed, for  use as hardcore on local
 motorways, while  the  vacated  sites 
 have been redeveloped, mainly  for new
 industrial  units  or  landscapd  to  
 please  the  eye.                     
     Britain's  first industrial canal,
 which cuts across the  area, was built
 by a local man  Henry Berry, who gives
 his name to Berry's Lane. It  has been
 in  disuse  since  the  turn  of  the 
 century, left  derelict  until  recent
 efforts  to create a Linear Park along
 its banks, attracting  wild life  to a
 barren area  and providing a whole new
 leisure scene for local people.
