		<content>{THE RAILWAY LINE}                     
 The Cental Line, running from London  
 Marylebone to Sheffield opened for    
 coal in July 1898 &amp; passengers in     
 March 1899. It ceased to operate on   
 Sept. 3rd, 1966.  It is however still 
 very visible by its banks as a disused
 line. All the rails were taken away in
 1966 but along the line a few mile-   
 stones still survive.  The line is now
 used again by the farmers.  The       
 biggest farm is a pig unit which is   
 where the Railway Signal Box &amp; sidings
 were.  The Old Railway House is still 
 lived in but bigger than when it was  
 first built.  One part of the line has
 been turned into a Conservation Area  
 where trees of all sorts have grown &amp; 
 the animal life is very interesting.  
 Pheasants, Partridges and Foxes all   
 live close together.  The bridges have
 survived into the modern day.         </content>
