		<content>  From the churchyard in Kenley one can
 see the Welsh mountains and from the  
 lower tower of the 13th Century Church
 part of Watling Street can be seen in 
 the valley to the north.              
   The church of St.John the Baptist   
 has 500 year old beams in the roof and
 a canopied pulpit made by Jacobean    
 craftsmen.  Similar to this is a chair
 in the chancel and carving in the     
 priest's desk. The organ is two manual
 and retains a hand pumping mechanism. 
   The present Post Office was formerly
 a school and house and is now the only
 Post Office within the area. There are
 no shopping facilities, people in the 
 village shopping either at Shrewsbury 
 or Much Wenlock.                      
   There is one farm in the village    
 called Church Farm and another        
 opposite the church which has 400     
 sheep and 50 cattle.                  </content>
