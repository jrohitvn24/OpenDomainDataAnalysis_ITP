		<content>  The main crops of the area are       
{cereals,}especially {wheat}and        
{barley.}A large area is left as       
 grassland, for{grazing, silage}and    
{hay. Straw}is made from the grain     
 stalks after harvest, and is used as  
 cattle bedding.{Oil seed rape}is a    
 major new crop, probably secondary    
 only to  cereals. Its products are    
 vegetable oil, lubricants and cattle  
 feed.{Root crops,}such as{potatoes}and
{sugar beet}are grown in smaller       
 quantities, and one farm grows        
 potatoes solely for a crisp factory.  
 The rejects are fed to the cattle.    
 Crop rotation is practised, selecting 
 the crop according to the land type;  
 clay or gravelly soils. Crops may vary
 according to how much land is         
 contracted out to firms which produce 
 their own crop. At the time of survey,
 100 acres is contracted to{peas.}     </content>
