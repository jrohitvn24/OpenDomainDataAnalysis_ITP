		<content>     We interviewed three people who   
 are newcomers to the village. Their   
 names are Mrs Smith, who is middle    
 aged, married and is a housewife. Also
 there is Mrs. Allies. She is a        
 housewife and is married with four    
 children. Her husband is a local      
 councillor. Mrs.Bennett is young,     
 married and a housewife. She has one  
 child. Her husband has almost rebuilt 
 their house because it was almost     
 derelict when they moved in.          
     Mrs. Smith has been living in the 
 area for three years. Her house is    
 about twenty years old. She likes the 
 area very much. She thinks it's       
 peaceful and easy for getting to town.
 She does'nt mind the country smells.  
 She would like to have a library and a
 village shop. She thinks the housing  
 estates are cramped and very lonely.
