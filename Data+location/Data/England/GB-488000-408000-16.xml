		<title>16The Elderly in Scunthorpe</title>
		<content>  Much is done to make life easier for 
{elderly people.}In our area we have   
 several{different kinds of housing    
 used by old people.                   
  Some elderly couples who are able to 
 look after themselves live in         
{bungalows}grouped together and have   
 meals supplied by a{"meals on wheels" 
 service. Other elderly people are     
 looked after by others in two{private 
{homes}where they have to pay about    
 Â£120 a week.                          
  Others live in three big{blocks}where
 they have small flats of their own and
 look after themselves but with a      
{warden}to help if needed.             
  Finally there is a{Day Centre}where  
 old people can go to meet and talk,   
 receive advice or just find company.  
 There is no need for anybody to be    
 lonely.                               
                                       </content>
