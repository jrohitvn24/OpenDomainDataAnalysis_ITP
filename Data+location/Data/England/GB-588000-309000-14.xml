		<content>    The population of the village is   
 presently expanding and in 1983, as   
 recorded in the Electoral Register,   
 it totalled{1,773.}The Births and     
 Deaths average out at two a month     
 each.                                 
                                       
 Because of the fact that there are    
 so many bungalows in the village, and 
 that property is amongst the cheapest 
 in the country, there are a great many
 retired people who have lived in the  
 area nearly all their lives or who    
 have come from other parts of the     
 country, chiefly from the South.
