		<title>15TODAY'S LIFE-STYLES.</title>
		<content> Many women work away from home;       
 commuters spend long hours away.      
 Cultural pursuits and education tend  
 to be out side the area and with      
 smaller families the viability of some
 youth clubs is reduced. Toddlers      
 increasingly attend play groups.TV has
 a marked influence on social life.    
 Residents often move on after some    
 years and few are born and brought up 
 here. All households possess labour-  
 saving appliances and some have       
 videos. Children own bicycles. A car  
 is needed for shoppong except in      
 Ripley, hence many two-car families.  
 In the affluent parts of the area many
 people own holiday homes or caravans  
 and take an annual holiday abroad. The
 less affluent find the lack of public 
 transport constricting.Recently there 
 has been a marked increase in the     
 level of spending on leisure pursuits.</content>
