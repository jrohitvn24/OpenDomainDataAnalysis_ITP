		<content>{The Odeon}was designed by Andrew      
 Mather and was built in 1935 on the   
 site of a large Victorian house. It   
 started off with one large auditorium 
 but now there are three. Two small    
 studios hold 135 people each and a    
 large studio holds 452 people. Family 
 films are the most popular. Holidays  
 are the most popular viewing times.   
                                       
{The Civic Hall}is the largest in      
 Surrey. It was built to house the     
 newly formed Philarmonic Orchestra in 
 1962. Gradually, one hall became      
 multi-purpose and is used for such    
 things as pop concerts, charity       
 events, wrestling, discos, dances and 
 fashion shows. The seating capacity is
 2080 in the hall and balcony. The     
 county suite and bar seats 100 people.
 The foyer also serves as a tourist    
 information centre.                   </content>
