		<content>  The major issue was the proposed     
{sports centre.}The town was divided   
 over:1/ whether a swimming pool should
 be included, doubling the cost.2/ its 
 location. The choice was between the  
 town centre and King Arthurs school.  
  Businessmen were reported to be angry
 over new charges for the collection of
 rubbish.The{bottle bank}was opened.Car
{parking}was to be improved but there  
 was opposition when a charge system   
 was proposed.                         
  A notable event was the publication  
 of Mr.Puffy Bowden's{book}"Wincanton: 
 Pleasant Town on the Cale."           
  The{sewerage works}were redeveloped. 
  Everyone we asked in our shopping    
 survey used{Wincanton shops}for at    
 least some of their weekly groceries. 
 Everyone also went shopping in Yeovil,
 often for electrical goods. Street was
 popular. Cities were used for gifts.  </content>
