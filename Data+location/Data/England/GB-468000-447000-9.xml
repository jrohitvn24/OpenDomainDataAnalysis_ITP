 Elvington treatment works treats water
 from the river Derwent.Then it is used
 by people in the home for drinks,bath 
 water and so on .The water is pumped  
 into the works from the river and put 
 into special tanks.Chemicals are add  
 to change the colour and to get rid   
 of bacteria which might cause disease.
 The people at the works remove the    
 used chemicals and dirt as sludge     
 through a large under water draw-off  
 bucket.This allows the clean water    
 to be taken off.All the used chemicals
 and bacteria are pumped to the sludge 
 lagoons.The water is pumped by the    
 treatmant works into the Yorkshire    
 Water Grid System.Then it goes to     
 cities like Barnsley,Leeds,Rotherham  
 and Sheffield.This helps to provide   
 large numbers of people with the water
 they need.                            </content>
