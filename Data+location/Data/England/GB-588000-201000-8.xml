		<content> Most houses have their own private    
 telephone. Three telephone kiosks all 
 without directories and often         
 vandalised.                           
 Four post boxes with twice daily      
 collection taken to Chelmsford for    
 sorting. One daily postal delivery    
 with occasional extra delivery for    
 businesses.                           
 Monthly Parish magazine prepared      
 voluntarily by residents. Contains    
 local news, notices about meetings,   
 reports of clubs and activities.      
 Supported by advertising and delivered
 free to every house.                  
 Large number of footpaths crossing    
 farmland and along sea wall. Notably  
 St. Peter's Way still used by pilgrims
 to the oldest religious building in   
 Great Britain.
