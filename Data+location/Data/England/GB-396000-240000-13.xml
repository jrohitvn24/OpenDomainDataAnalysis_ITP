 Churches in Elmley Castle,Little      
 Comberton and Bricklehampton belong to
 the same Church of England            
 parish.Other denominations are catered
 for in Pershore.Congregations are     
 small in spite of efforts by the vicar
 and his assistant,the Diocesan        
 Agricultural Chaplain.A combined      
 church choir has been formed and the  
 church bells are being rung.The       
 churches are in a good state of repair
 and there is no lack of support to    
 raise money locally for church fabric.
 In the past three years Â£12,000 has   
 been spent on Elmley Castle church and
 Â£9,000 on Little Comberton church.The 
 stone walls surrounding the           
 churchyards in Elmley Castle and      
 Little Comberton have recently been   
 rebuilt by the Manpower Services      
 Commission.                           </content>
