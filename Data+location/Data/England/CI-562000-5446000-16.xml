		<title>16VICTORIA COLLEGE, ST.HELIER</title>
		<content>   Victoria College was established in 
 1852 and stands on a hill overlooking 
 St.Helier. It is a fee paying public  
 school aided by the States of Jersey. 
 The 600 boys follow an academic course
 and are proud of their sporting record
 especially against their great rivals,
 Elizabeth College, Guernsey.          
   The school motto is{Amat Victoria   
{Curam}which means "A Victorian thrives
 on work".                             
   The school has a boarding house for 
 overseas students and a preparatory   
 school, both on the same campus. The  
 Prep also excels in sport and is famed
 for its choir and annual play.        
   Many Old Victorians play a prominent
 role in island life (eg.the Bailiff   
 designate Mr.P.Crill) and among famous
 OV's are Kenneth More and Colonel     
 Blashford-Snell.
