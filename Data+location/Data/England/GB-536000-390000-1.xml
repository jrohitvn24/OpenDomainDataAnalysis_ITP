 Most of this area is farm-land, mainly
 growing cereals and rough grazing for 
 sheep and cattle.                     
 There is an extensive system of       
 drainage dykes which take the rain    
 water away from the very flat, low    
 lying land in the North and East of   
 the area. The land rises slightly to  
 the West and the villages of Alvingham
 and North Cockerington are built on   
 this higher ground.                   
 The "Louth Navigation" canal runs     
 through the area, deviding the two    
 villages, as does the River Lud.      
 Alvingham is the older and larger of  
 the two settlements, its unique       
 feature being the{two}churches in{one}
 church-yard.
