		<title>09FARM SURVEY OUTLINE</title>
		<content> All the farms recorded on the         
 Ordinance Survey map of the area were 
 sent a questionaire by the children.  
 They were asked these questions.      
 How big is the farm (acres/hectares)? 
 How many pasture fields do you have?  
 How many fields for crops other than  
 grass?                                
 How many grass fields for hay/silage? 
 What other crops are grown this year? 
 How many of the following do you have;
 milking cows, beef cattle, breeding   
 ewes, lambs for meat, pigs, chickens, 
 geese? Are there any other animals?   
 How many tractors are in use?         
 What other machines do you have?      
 How many people work full time and    
 part time? (Full time means 40 hours a
 week)                                 
 Is there anything else that you think 
 we have missed out that you think is  
 important?                            </content>
