 building is about 80 years old and the
 new one was built in 1969.We have     
 about 160 children and 7 teachers and 
 a Secretary, Caretaker,Ancillary,     
 dinner ladies and cooks.The school    
 covers about 2-3 acres.We have a big  
 apparatus section on the field with a 
 rope pulley,climbing frame,swings etc.
 The Hall was a classroom but now it   
 has a stage for plays and apparatus   
 for PE.We have interviewed some of the
 people who work at the school.{Mrs J. 
{Richardson}is the school Secretary.   
 She has been working at the school for
 about 8\ years.She thinks our new     
 headmaster{Mr Jones}is very nice to   
 work with.She likes typing but she    
 also collects money.She uses about 5  
 sheets of paper a day but if she is   
 duplicating she uses a lot more.She   
 wishes to stay in Sutton all her life.</content>
