		<content>   The area covered by the three       
 kilometre squares of Kilnhurst Church 
 of England School is mainly farmland. 
 It is an area used for agriculture    
 with evidence of five farms and out-  
 buildings still standing today.  There
 is a small amount of woodland and two 
 disused stone quarries as well as a   
 reservoir.  Several minor roads cover 
 the area and run from north to south  
 and east to west.  The landscape is   
 very uneven and rises from a height of
 seventy five feet to over two hundred 
 and fifty feet above sea-level.  All  
 the farm buildings are built from the 
 local stone and may have come from the
 disused quarries in the area. There is
 no livestock on the farms and all the 
 land is used for growing crops.  One  
 point of interest is an osier.  This  
 was an area used for growing willow   
 for basketwork.                       </content>
