		<title>12HOMELIFE.A DAY IN MY LIFE.</title>
		<content> My name is Sarah Anderson I live in a 
 small village called Chop Gate,I was  
 going camping with my patrol of       
 Girl Guides.I woke up on Wednesday May
 29th at a quarter to 8 with a feeling 
 of excitement inside me .I got up and 
 went downstairs to have my breakfast, 
 we had B&amp;B's for the night so I had to
 be quiet.After breakfast I went       
 outside to do my bedding roll then we 
 set off,on our way to Kirby we picked 
 the Birnies up.There was seven of us  
 alltogether.First of all Heather and I
 put the toilet tent up.After all that 
 we had our packed lunches then we put 
 the wash and store tents up then we   
 decided what to do next.We set off    
 towards the river in our bathing suits
 when we got there only 4 people dared 
 go in.When we got back we had         
 corned  beef hash &amp; angel delight for 
 dinner,then bedtime.                  </content>
