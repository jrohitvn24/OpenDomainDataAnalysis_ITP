		<title>01The Port of Deal, Kent</title>
		<content> The area is predominantly coastal with
 older style properties and enclosed   
 rough pasture land for grazing. Many  
 of the houses were originally used by 
 sailors when the port of Deal was a   
 thriving community. these dwelling    
 places have now been converted into   
 private residential homes, flats and  
 small owner occupied properties. the  
 main shopping area comprises of single
 shops with traditional frontages. The 
 Royal Cinque Ports Golf Club occupies 
 a large proportion of the land area.  
 It follows the contours of the coast  
 and is a links golf course. Sandown   
 Castle is an ancient ruin which was   
 part of the Tudor fortifications.     
 There is very little of this site     
 remaining. The pasture land comprises 
 of marsh land, rough grazing and      
 enclosed grazing areas for sheep and  
 cattle.                               </content>
