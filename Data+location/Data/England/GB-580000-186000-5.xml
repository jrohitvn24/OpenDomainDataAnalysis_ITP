		<content>   The woodland management is improving
 wild-flower populations but bird      
 populations vary. The{tit, redpoll,   
{goldcrest, siskin and kestrel}are     
 nesting in larger numbers but the     
 numbers of{night-jar, nightingale,    
{tree pipit, owl and turtle-dove}are   
 declining. The numbers of warblers and
 other migrant nesting birds remain    
 steady.                               
{  Badger and fox}populations are high 
 at present and deer may occasionally  
 be seen. There are few rabbits and    
 even fewer bats.{Grey squirrels, jays 
 and{magpies}are too numerous as they  
 have no predators. Magpies are thought
 to account for perhaps 50% of the     
 deaths among the young of other       
 species. Culling, however, is not     
 practised at present due to fear of   
 public misunderstanding.
