		<content>  The Pear Tree Estate                 
 First of all we went round Pear Tree  
 Estate.At the moment there are a lot  
 of changes;first of all the houses    
 have changed from plaster_based to    
 solid brick ones.Before the houses    
 were built there was just             
 grassland.They never planted crops    
 because the ground was too rocky.The  
 houses are eighteen years old.On      
 Highfield Avenue they are moving      
 people into caravans while rebuilding 
 their houses.Jasmin Close and Fern    
 Close are going to be knocked down and
 then they will plant trees.When we had
 investigated our area we went back to 
 school.                               
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
