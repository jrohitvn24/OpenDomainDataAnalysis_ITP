		<title>03THE VILLAGE PANTOMIME</title>
		<content>     The pantomimes in Hollingbourne   
 started in 1979 after a successful Old
 Time Evening. The first village       
 pantomime was written by Dr.Derek     
 Manners and the music composed by Dr. 
 Peter Bonds, both of whom live and    
 practice in the village. Over the     
 years they have taken it in turns to  
 write and produce pantomimes and Dr.  
 Bonds has contributed all the songs   
 and music. Many villagers are involved
 over the six months of production in  
 scenery, costumes, acting and props.  
 The five performances are attended by 
 a total audience of 600 people and all
 the profits are presented to the      
 Village Hall. The planned pantomime   
 for 1986 is Robinsoe Crusoe In Space. 
     A thriving village drama group has
 developed from the pantomimes.
