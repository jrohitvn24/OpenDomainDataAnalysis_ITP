		<content> she kept her cows that means she sold 
 milk.The post offices were all over   
 the place.The first one was where Mr. 
 Jorden lives now to the left of the no
 cycling path on the High street.The   
 next one is where the spar is today   
 then it went to the old forge next to 
 the garage.Then it went to where it is
 today.The butcher shop used to be a   
 saddlers owned by a Mr.Fuller.When you
 went into the shop there was a lovely 
 smell of leather.In the last 20 years 
 alot of estates have been built, for  
 instance: Manor Close,Bowdens,The     
 Orchard, Peppercombe Close,The Paddock
 ,Walnut Close,and many others.The     
 roads  haven't changed much appart    
 from the roads into the estates , but 
 they did make a big change from three 
 ways on the Lavington road down to the
 butchers where they widened it for    
 traffic and cut the bank away.        </content>
