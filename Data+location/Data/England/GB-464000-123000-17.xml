		<title>17AT THE WEEKEND</title>
		<content> On Saturday I got up early and went   
 out with my Dad to see if we could    
 find any mushrooms. We didn't find    
 many, but we heard a nightingale. At  
 8.30 I had breakfast of sausages,     
 bacon and eggs and went outside to    
 feed the chicks. Then I played on the 
 computer until I had soup and cheese  
 on toast for lunch. Then I went to    
 Warnford to see my cousins. At about  
 3.30 when I got home I used my punch  
 bag. I had salad for tea, then watched
 television and went to bed. I woke up 
 at 7.30 on Sunday. I go boxing. We run
 around a field two times then we punch
 heavy bags. Then we skip. I  went home
 and had Sunday roast for dinner. I    
 hate it. I changed and rode to        
 Warnford but there was no-one to play 
 with so I went home, had tea, watched 
 telly, then went to bed.
