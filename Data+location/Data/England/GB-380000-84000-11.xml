		<title>11ST.CHRISTOPHER'S CHURCH</title>
		<content> St.Christopher's is the Parish Church 
 of Winfrith Newburgh.Nowadays the     
 vicar,Mr.Moorsom,looks after four     
 parishes.Lulworth,East Lulworth,      
 Chaldon Herring and Winfrith Newburgh.
 The Norman Porches of the church are  
 the oldest parts.The church was       
 enlarged in 1852.In the 1930's the    
 chancel roof was rebuilt using one    
 large oak tree.Hidden in the roof is a
 bottle containing all the names of all
 the workmen.The lych Gate was added   
 after the 1st. World War by local     
 craftsmen using local timber.         
 Mr.Moorsom comes to school to talk to 
 us every week.Our school goes to      
 sprcial services at the church for    
 Harvest Festival,Christmas and Easter.
 We have a Leaver's Service in the     
 Summer,and all the children who are   
 leaving the school are allowed to     
 climb up the tower.                   </content>
