		<content>     This area is served by a number of
 small town parks such as Portswood    
 recreation ground, Lawn Park, and     
 Riverside Park near Cobden bridge.    
 The latter was developed by reclaiming
 land by infilling with the Town's     
 refuse. These parks provide extensive 
 open grassland with facilities for    
 football, cricket, pitch, and putting 
 greens as well as childrens'          
 playgrounds for the local children.   
     Along the riverside there are     
 private moorings for motor and sailing
 boats and also for a number of        
 houseboats. There is a rowing club.   
     Dotted around the area are some   
 small industries involving            
 metalworking, scrap metal processing  
 and warehousing and service           
 industries. The Council developed     
 Belgrave Rd. to accommodate small     
 industries.                           </content>
