		<content>   When we play games we can use the   
 village playing field which is        
 opposite the school. We play{netball, 
{football, rounders}and{cricket.}We    
 have matches against nine other       
 schools in the{Dove Valley League.}We 
 particularly enjoy{Summer Sports Day} 
 held each year in July.               
   We do not have our own swimming pool
 but the Junior children walk to the   
 pool at{Needwood School.}This walk    
 takes about 15 minutes. We also take  
 part in the{Burton Junior Schools     
{Swimming Gala and Gymnastic           
{Competition.}                         
   On a Tuesday evening the Junior     
 children have a{Club}from 6.00 until  
 7.30 p.m. Parents help to run the club
 and we can use a computer, knit, sew, 
 play table tennis and other games. We 
 go on visits and have a tuck shop.
