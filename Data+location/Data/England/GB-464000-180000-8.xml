		<content>Woodcote has developed from a small    
scattered community into a large       
commuter dormitory village of 3000     
people. In the last 20 years many new  
housing estates have been built. Most  
of the houses are made of brick and    
are detached or semi-detached. Over 90%
of the houses in the village are owner 
occupied. Very few houses are more than
100 years old. Some of these older     
houses date from the Middle Ages. There
are some thatched cottages which date  
from the 16th century. Outside the     
village are scattered farm houses,     
cottages and one or two large          
houses. There is a small settlement    
around an old coaching inn in Exlade   
Street which used to be part of the    
main road between Crowmarsh Gifford and
Reading.
