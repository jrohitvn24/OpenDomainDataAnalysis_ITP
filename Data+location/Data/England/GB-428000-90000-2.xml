		<title>02THE BEACH</title>
		<content>     The beach at Milford on Sea is    
 mainly shingle but at low tide there  
 is some sand. We have a big wall      
 because when the Solent gets rough it 
 used to push the shingle onto the     
 road.                                 
     Futher along the beach it gets    
 wider but in the next few years I     
 think it will be pushed along to the  
 spit. The spit is about two miles long
 , at the end of it there is a castle  
 called Hurst castle. They had to put  
 bolders in to make the spit stronger. 
 In the winter the sea gets over the   
 wall and floods part of the village.
