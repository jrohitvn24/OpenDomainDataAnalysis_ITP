		<title>01THE NORTHERN PART OF GOSPORT</title>
		<content> THE AREA COVERED IN THESE SQUARES     
 COMPRISES THE NORTHERN PART OF THE    
 BOROUGH OF GOSPORT AND THE SOUTHERN   
 PART OF THE BOROUGH OF FAREHAM. THE   
 NAVAL INFLUENCE IN THE AREA IS        
 CONSIDERABLE.  H.M.S. COLLINGWOOD AND 
 H.M.S. DAEDALUS AS WELL AS THE R.N.A.Y
 FLEETLANDS ARE SITUATED HERE.  AS THE 
 SIZE OF THE NAVY HAS DECLINED,        
 ALTERNATIVE EMPLOYMENT HAS GROWN UP IN
 A NUMBER OF INDUSTRIAL ESTATES SUCH AS
 THOSE AT FORT FAREHAM AND NEWGATE     
 LANE.  WITH THE EXCEPTION OF NEWLANDS 
 FARM, MOST OF THE OPEN SPACES IN THE  
 AREA ARE M.O.D. PROPERTY.  THE MAIN   
 RESIDENTIAL AREA IS BRIDGEMARY -      
 ORIGINALLY BEGUN AS HOUSING FOR THOSE 
 WHO LOST THEIR HOMES IN GOSPORT DURING
 WORLD WAR 2 BOMBING RAIDS.  THE       
 HISTORIC STRATEGIC IMPORTANCE OF      
 GOSPORT IS EXEMPLIFIED BY FORT        
 BROCKHURST - NOW OPEN TO THE PUBLIC.  </content>
