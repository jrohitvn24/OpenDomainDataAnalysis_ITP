		<title>10THE FARM ESTATE AND MANSION</title>
		<content> The mansion has large gardens, a pond 
 and is surrounded by streaches of     
 lawn.                                 
 Three people work in the gardens. One 
 of the gardeners thinks that the vil_ 
 lage is very peaceful and quiet be_   
 cause of the no through road. At the  
 front of the mansion there is a high  
 deer leap above a footpath. The man_  
 sion is set in the middle of the farm 
 estate. Altogether there are 2500 acr_
 es, including woodland.  Every weekend
 in the summer Lord and Lady FitzWalter
 open their gardens to raise money for 
 different charities. On average 2000  
 people come each year. If you want to 
 go round the gardens you buy a ticket 
 costing 80p. Afterwards you can buy   
 tea and cakes in the old coach house. 
 Different people serve the teas each  
 week. The school children do it       
 sometimes.                            </content>
