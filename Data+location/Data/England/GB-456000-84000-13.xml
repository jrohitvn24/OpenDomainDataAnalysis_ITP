		<title>13ALL SAINTS CHURCH-Newchurch1</title>
		<content> This lovely old church was originally 
 built by William Fitz Osborne in the  
 11th Century.  The name "New Church"  
 tells of days when the small          
 pre-conquest church was rebuilt in    
{NORMAN times.} The church has been    
 enlarged twice, once in the 12th      
 century and once in the 13th century. 
 The All Saints Church is different    
 from most of the other churches on the
 Isle of Wight.  It's{TOWER}is on the  
 south side.  It should be on the west 
 side.  It is on the south side because
 on the west side there is a very, very
 steep shute and by now thetower would 
 have crumbled away.  The church is    
 even more strange because the top part
 of the tower is weather boarded.  Just
 inside the door are a few ropes which 
 are used to ring{ BELLS}at the top of 
 the tower.
