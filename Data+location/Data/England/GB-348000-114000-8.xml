		<title>08The Odcombe Over 60's Club.</title>
		<content> The{club}was started on the first     
 Thursday in June 1964. It was first   
 held in the old{Village Hall}which was
 situated on the site where the        
 Bungalows at{Coryate close}now stand. 
 When it first started Mrs Annie       
 Brooks was in charge,now Mrs Dorothy  
 Axe is in charge. The members play    
{Bingo,Whist and Nap.}Sometimes they   
 have a film show, or an interesting   
 talk. They get three{outings}a year,  
 and go to at least one show. The club 
 is held  once a week on Thursday      
 afternoons from 2.30 to 4.30 and runs 
 a Whist Drive fortnightly on Thursdays
 starting at 8.00pm. The club is       
 fortunate to still have two founder   
 members, both well over{eighty years  
{old.                                  
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
