		<title>18The landscape of Greenwich</title>
		<content> he one kilometre square that we are   
looking at doesn,t have much grass in  
it apart from the obvieus people,s     
back gardens, that is if  they have    
any.The landscape of our square        
is mainly full of houses shop and      
a couple of in dustinal places.        
In my view the main part of our square 
is probably the hospital The main part 
of the area is on the side of a hill.  
The roads where all the shops are      
trafalgar road and woolwich road,are   
fairly grotty and grimy with the fumes 
from the power station and other near  
by places with chimneys i think this   
area could be improved as it is not    
the nicest place in the world to go    
shoping. the area on the whole through 
is a fairly pleasant area live in.
