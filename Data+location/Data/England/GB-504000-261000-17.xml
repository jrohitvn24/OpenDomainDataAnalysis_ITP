		<title>17RISELEY PLAYGROUP</title>
		<content>      Riseley Playgroup celebrated 18  
 years this year.  It was one of the   
 first to be registared with the       
 Playgroup Association.  It takes      
 children from the age of 2.5 years to 
 5 years although most manage to get   
 into nursery school which is attached 
 to the lower school,by the age of 4   
 years.  There is also a mother's  and 
 toddlers' group which is aimed at     
 mothers and babies.  They meet once   
 a week in the village hall for coffee 
 and a quick chat.                     
      The playgroup meets twice a week 
 from 9.30 a.m. to 11.30 a.m. There are
 two supervisors and these are mums who
 help out on the rota system.  The     
 children play games,paint,have stories
 and learn to share and get on with one
 another.
