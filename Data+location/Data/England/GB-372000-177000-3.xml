  Close to the M4 are the Avon County  
 Council Highways Department           
 buildings,dominated by a large pile of
 salted grit.A public weighbridge site 
 is used to check the weight of heavy  
 goods vehicles to ensure that they are
 within the Ministry of Transport      
 weight regulations.                   
  This is a popular place for rest     
 stops and the two large lay-bys are   
 always full, often with commuters'    
 cars parked for the day by car sharing
 drivers.  A mobile snack bar at       
 present                               
 supplies their needs. An attractive   
 picnic site is near completion,with   
 parking spaces,picnic  tables and     
 benches and WCs.                      
  The Water Board also has a service   
 reservoir at this location.
