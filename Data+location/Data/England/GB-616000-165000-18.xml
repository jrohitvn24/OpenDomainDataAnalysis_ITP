          {NEW ESTATE}                 
  LIFE IN HERNE BAY IS A FAMILIAR      
 ROUTINE. I GET UP AT 7.3OA.M. ON      
 SCHOOL DAYS AND HAVE BREAKFAST. I     
 START WALKING TO SCHOOL AT 8.3O P.M.  
 AND ARRIVE AT 8.45 P.M. THE NEXT 6    
 HOURS IS THEN SPENT AT SCHOOL. AT HOME
 MY LEISURE TIME IS SPENT WATCHING     
 T.V.,READING BOOKS OR PLAYING TENNIS  
 WITH MY SISTER. I GO TO BED AT 9 P.M. 
 OR 9.3O P.M.                          
    I WATCH TELEVISION OR READ         
 AT THE WEEKENDS OR PLAY STOOLBALL WITH
 MY SISTER. OUR HOUSE IS IN A NICE     
 PLACE FACING THE COUNTRYSIDE. THE     
 GARDEN IS QUITE BIG TO PLAY IN.       
  I GET 25P. A WEEK AND SPEND IT ON    
 SWEETS.
