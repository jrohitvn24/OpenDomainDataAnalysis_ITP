		<title>18Families - Naomi</title>
		<content>My name is Naomi Warren and I am 8     
years old and I have a grown up sister 
called Mandy who is 23 and has a baby  
called Jodie. I ahave a brother called 
Vince who is 19. I have a dog and a    
fish as pets. The dog is called Jake.  
I like eating, especially chicken and  
turkey, but I don't like cabbage or    
carrot, but I have to eat some - Mum   
says.                                  
My favourite books are written by Enid 
Blyton. I like ghost stories.          
We have two cars and go in the back of 
the red one with my dog.               
We have lots of relations in           
Hertfordshire and London. My Mum and   
Dad come from London. My Dad is a      
builder who works in Stowmarket.       
My best friend is Carla, who lives on  
Blackheath.
