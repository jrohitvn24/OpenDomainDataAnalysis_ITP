		<title>17THE LEE MOOR AREA-HOUSING.</title>
		<content> Perhaps the most significant aspect of
 housing in the the area is the lack of
 housing development presently taking  
 place.In fact,few houses have been    
 built in the last twenty years.Apart  
 from several farms and cottages all   
 the residential housing is in Lee Moor
 village.All of these houses are owned 
 by the company of English China Clays.
 Some terraces are over one hundred and
 twenty years old.They were originally 
 built for the china clay workers.Even 
 today all of these houses are         
 occupied by present,or retired workers
 in the china clay industry.The older  
 houses were built of stone,most of    
 which have been rendered.The roofs are
 covered with slates.Many people in the
 village use 'open' fires for heating. 
 The thick walls of the cottages,      
 sometimes over a metre thick,help to  
 retain heat in the winter.            </content>
