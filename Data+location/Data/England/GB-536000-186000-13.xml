		<title>13LEYTON FIRE STATION E.10.</title>
		<content> LEYTON FIRE STATION is on the bend of 
 Church road just before Oliver Rd.It  
 only has one Fire Engine.The station  
 was built at the start of the First   
 World War in 1914.                    
 In April 1985 there were 100 emergency
 calls made to Leyton Fire Brigade.Only
 50 calls were actual fires and 25 were
 special visits e.g. to get cats down  
 from trees ,rescue people trapped in  
 lifts etc.The other 25 were either    
 false calls or goodwill calls. A      
 goodwill call is when the caller      
 thinks they are doing the right thing 
 but when the fire brigade arrives they
 find that it is only a bonfire etc.   
 In Leyton fire station they have a    
 teleprinter which tells them exactly  
 where the emergency call was made.This
 helps them trace the "false           
 callers"and tell them not to do it    
 again or fine them.                   </content>
