		<title>12HOUSING IN BARLBY</title>
		<content>  We have a few estates round Barlby:  
 Barratt's (which is our newest),the   
 Third Estate and Northfield.          
 There are many streets with terraced  
 houses near the Toll Bridge.          
 In the new estate there are mostly    
 semi_detached and detached houses with
 gardens.                              
 A lot of new houses have been built in
 the last few years because people have
 moved in to work at the new coalmine .
 A  Mine Rescue Station was built      
 throughout this year and all the      
 people that work there live in a new  
 estate together. Nobody is allowed in 
 unless they work there.               
 There are also some old buildings in  
 the village e.g. Old School, Barlby   
 House and Barlby Hall.                
 Leaving Barlby on the Hull Road you   
 come to Osgodby where the houses are  
 mostly semi_detached and bungalows.   </content>
