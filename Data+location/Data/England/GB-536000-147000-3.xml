 chosen for their hardy character.

 family for 60 years. It is now run by 
 Mr.John Collard and his wife. Mr.     
 Collard's father lives in retirement  
 in a bungalow adjacent to the farm    
 house. The farm is one of four in the 
 area which at one time formed the{    
{Lagham Manor Estate.}It is family run 
 with outside labour used during the
