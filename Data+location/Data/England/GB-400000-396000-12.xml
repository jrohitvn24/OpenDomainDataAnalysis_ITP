		<title>12HOLLINGWORTH AND ENVIRONS</title>
		<content> Hollingworth is in the Longdendale    
 Valley. The River Etherow flows from  
 east to west past the side of an old  
 cotton mill called John Walton's.     
 There used to be a lot of cotton mills
 which were always near water so that  
 they could make steam to work the     
 machines in the mills. The mills are  
 now derelict or being used for small  
 businesses.                           
   The older houses were built on      
 either side of the busy main road.    
 Round about are hills and grazing land
 and pasture land for sheep and cows.  
 There are farms and fields where hay  
 is made for cattle to eat in the      
 winter. There are dry stone walls to  
 separate the fields.                  
   There is a big farm called Meadow   
 Bank Farm where they sell milk to the 
 people. A tanker also collects milk   
 from the farm.                        </content>
