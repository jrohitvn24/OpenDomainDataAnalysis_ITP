		<title>09Housing in Exbourne area.</title>
		<content> Most of the village is very old.The   
 houses are made of cob or stone.Quite 
 a few are thatched,most are slated.   
 There are a few Council houses and old
 peoples bungalows.What was the Manor  
 garden is now a new estate of         
 Executive type houses,too expensive   
 for the locals to buy.There are also a
 few individual plots for private house
 building.There are 3 farms in the     
 village,2 are Saxon in origin,and cob.
      4 are red brick Victorian        
 buildings,1 of these is the Post      
 Office.                               
 In Honeychuch there are three farms.  
 One is cob.One is stone. One is       
 Georgian.We think this is cob and     
 stone,the outside is smooth rendered. 
 Other farms in the area are cob if    
 mediaeval;stone if later and brick if 
 recently built.
