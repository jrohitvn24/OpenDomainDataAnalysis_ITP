		<title>13Leigh Bakery</title>
		<content> Number 17, Broadway West is a bakery. 
 It sells cakes and bread and has a    
 picnic bar. The first owner was Mr    
 Offord. The story goes that the shop  
 used to be a drapers. One day Mr      
 Offord's daughter brought some cakes  
 to the shop. They sold so well that Mr
 Offord turned it into a baker's shop. 
 The manager, Mr Flanagan, showed us   
 round. He has owned it since 1971. He 
 has 4 other bakeries and a butcher's  
 shop. He employs 50 people and 14 work
 in the bakery. Opening hours are      
 8am-5pm. It is closed half day        
 Wednesday, all day Sunday and Saturday
 is the busiest day of the week. There 
 is a silo which holds 12\ tons of     
 flour. The tanker that fills the silo 
 can hold 20 tons. It takes about 20   
 minutes to fill the silo. When it is  
 full a warning bell rings and the     
 driver removes the pipes.  (cont'd)   </content>
