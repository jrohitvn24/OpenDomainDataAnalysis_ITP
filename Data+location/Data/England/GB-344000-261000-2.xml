		<content>   The population of Kingsland is 650  
 and that of Eyton is 80.  Over half   
 the households belong to families who 
 have lived here  for over 50 years,   
 some for 100 to 200 years and at least
 two families who have lived here since
 the 15th and 16th centuries.  These,  
 and many others, come from            
 Herefordshire or Wales.  Since 1969   
 there has been much new building in   
 the area which has attracted people   
 from other parts of the country,      
 including several retired people.     
 These have integrated well, thanks to 
 the churches, school, Women's         
 Institute and other groups.           
   There is a Kingsland Conservative   
 Association.  Liberal Alliance and    
 Labour supporters belong to           
 wider-based associations.
