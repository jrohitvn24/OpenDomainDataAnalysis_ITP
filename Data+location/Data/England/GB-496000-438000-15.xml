		<title>15HOUSING IN BISHOP BURTON</title>
		<content> Bishop Burton is a small picturesque  
 village with a total of 96 dwellings  
 (the population being 370, 73 of which
 are old age pensioners).  In the past 
 a large proportion of houses were     
 rented but now many have been sold    
 because of the high prices they can   
 command from outsiders willing to     
 commute to the nearby towns to work.  
 There are approximately 30 council    
 houses, originally built for          
 farmworkers, but which are now  mainly
 occupied by old age pensioners who    
 have lived all their lives in the     
 village; only three farmworkers       
 remain.                               
 Many council houses have been bought  
 by their tenants.  There are          
 4 to 6 special pensioners houses      
 called Alms houses run by The Hamsby  
 Committee.                            
                                       </content>
