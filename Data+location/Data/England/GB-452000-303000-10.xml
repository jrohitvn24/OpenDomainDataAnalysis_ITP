		<content> I am going to tell you about the      
 school that I go to,it is called      
 Alderman Newtons School after the man 
 who started it.The school is 201 years
 old but the buildings we now use are  
 only about 9 years old.There are about
 1000 pupils attending the school aged 
 from 11 to 18 years old.Most of the   
 pupils live in Glenfield,New Parks or 
 Park Rise.                            
 There is another school next door     
 which is bigger than ours called New  
 Parks School.The rest of the area     
 consists of mostly houses but there   
 are three churches and a swimming     
 pool.The churches are (1)Church of    
 England (2)Catholic (3)Methodist      
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
