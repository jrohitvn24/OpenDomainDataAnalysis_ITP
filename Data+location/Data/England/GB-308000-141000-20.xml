 been collected and entered by{First   
{Year pupils at Danesfield C.E Middle

     They have been helped by the warm 
 cooperation of many people in the     
 area.    Mr Gibbons at Staple Farm    
 entertained children on two separate  
 occasions.   Mr Toogood the Blacksmith
 broke off his mornings work to talk to
 children about his work.   Mrs        
 Walmsely at the Hospital and Mrs      
 Pooley at the Library were equally    
 generous with their time.             
   {Mums and Dads}helped with          
{transporting children}around to far   
 corners of the block.   And in the    
 case of Mrs Snell did a lot of        
 homework writing notes about the      
 Doniford Holiday Village.
