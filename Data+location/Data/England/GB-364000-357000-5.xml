		<content> The{population}is very stable with    
 a large number of adults having always
 lived in the area,often in the same   
 farm or cottage. Few families come    
 from counties other than Cheshire.Of  
 the families with{children}living at  
 home the no. of offspring varies from 
 1 to 4,with 2 the most common. Adult  
{employment}includes farming (the major
 occupation) building contracting,     
 teaching, driving and policework. A   
 blacksmith also lives in and works    
 from the area. There is some          
 unemployment and also a number of     
 women who choose to stay at home,     
 either to look after young children,  
 to run the home, or to work from home.
 There are also a few people who have  
 retired from work and remain in the   
 area.
