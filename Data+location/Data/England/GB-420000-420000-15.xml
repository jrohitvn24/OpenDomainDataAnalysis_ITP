		<title>15RAG MERCHANTS - RAVENSTHORPE</title>
		<content> The Dewsbury district has always been 
 famous for the{rag trade,}that is, the
 sorting, tearing up and grinding of   
{waste woollen rags}which are re-worked
 into a coarse but serviceable cloth.  
 Of several rag merchants in the       
 locality{Plaistere and Hangers}are the
 only ones in Ravensthorpe. Their      
 factory consists of two buildings: one
 where the rags are stored; the other  
 where the rags are sorted, cut and    
 pressed into bales.(This firm does not
 actually re-work the rags into        
 cloth).Bales are then taken by wagon  
 to various buyers and many are        
 exported overseas to places like      
{Pakistan.                             
 The work, although physical and dirty,
 is enjoyable and workers are left     
 alone. Wages are based on{piece-rate}_
 so much per work done. There is no    
 union and few disputes with employers.</content>
