		<content> This is what happens to the vehicles  
 when they come into the Central       
 Vehicle Depot at Ashchurch.They are   
 taken first to the kit stores;this is 
 where they see if the vehicles have   
 the right kit.For example, each       
 vehicle must have an adjustable       
 spanner, screw driver, pair of pliers,
 and a wheel bracket.Then they go to be
 inspected to see if they are          
 roadworthy.If they are not,then they  
 go into the camp's own workshop to    
 be repaired .If the vehicles are new  
 and are not roadworthy then the       
 manufacturer has to come to do        
 the repairs under warranty.If they    
 are roadworthy, they are put into     
 storage,either inside or outside, or  
 sent to other bases. Some of the      
 vehicles are moved by train especially
 the cranes.There are 11000 vehicles in
 the camp at the present time.         </content>
