		<title>14The Rover Works &amp; others</title>
		<content> The biggest single factory in Solihull
 is The Rover Works. It is there that  
 the famous Rover cars and Land Rovers 
 are built. The Rover Company came to  
 the area during World War II.         
    As well as a massive factory the   
 company has a test track and sporting 
 and social facilities. The works      
 covered nearly the whole of one of the
 kilometre squares.                    
   Close by the Rover Works is a small 
 industrial estate with a large number 
 of small manufacturing firms. Although
 these are the only industrial areas in
 our block, Solihull itself has an     
 increasing number of industrial sites 
 and more and more people are finding  
 jobs in Solihull and not merely living
 there. Future plans incude a new      
 industrial park and a high tech area  
 close to the National Exhibition      
 Centre.                               </content>
