		<title>15THE COLLEGE SITE</title>
		<content> The present grounds which the college 
 occupies has performed four functions 
 and it is only since 1843 that there  
 has been the famous{Public School}in  
 Marlborough.                          
                                       
 A{castle}of wood was the first        
 buiding on the mound later            
 replaced by a more permanent structure
 of stone.  The private college pool is
 found in what is left of the moat and 
 the mound proved ideal for the keeps. 
                                       
 Once this had been demolished a       
{private house}was built, which remains
 standing today as a boarding house.   
 Records show that King Charles II and 
 William Pitt the elder have stayed in 
 the house, either when it was private 
 or when it was transformed into a     
{coaching house}- a pleasant stop for  
 travellers to and from Bath and London</content>
