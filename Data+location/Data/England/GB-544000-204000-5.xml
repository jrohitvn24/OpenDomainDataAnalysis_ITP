		<title>05LATTON PRIORY FARM</title>
		<content> Near Junction 7 of the M11,off the    
 B1393 Harlow-Thornwood road,we find   
 Latton Priory Farm.                   
 In the farm we saw the remains of an  
 old Priory.This building is now used  
 to store farm machinery.              
 The farm owner keeps over a hundred   
 bullocks in large sheds with a paddock
 next to them.The farm is arable,with  
 oilseed rape,peas,beans and barley    
 growing in the fields.Two small fields
 of linseed were grown,hoping for good 
 weather to give a good yield.         
 The Priory was originally the work of 
 the Augustinian monks.The Priory still
 has its original architecture,with    
 tiles on the original wood beams.The  
 walls are of flint stones and the     
 floor is still cobbled.               
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
