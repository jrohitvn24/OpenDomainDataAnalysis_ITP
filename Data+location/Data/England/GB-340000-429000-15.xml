		<content>I interviewed Mr.John Nelson who works 
at BAe in Warton, in the aerodynamics  
department. He works on the study of   
the airflow around an aircraft. He     
helps to design the shape of the E.F.A.
His work involves analysis of wind     
tunnel results to decide on the best   
shape and using the wind tunnel data to
predict the aircraft's performance.    
This involves very complicated         
mathematical problems which can only be
solved by using powerful               
computers.There are one hundred and ten
people working in aerodynamics and most
of them have a university degree in    
either aeronautical engineering or     
science. The working conditions in the 
aerodynamics department are good with a
modern air-conditioned office block.
