		<title>11Old Treworgey Farm.</title>
		<content>      Mr.Crabb and his son farm Old    
 Treworgey which is about 115 years old
 and they have lived on the farm for 29
 years. On the land there are 17 acres 
 of fodder beet, 15 acres of barley and
 the rest is grass. The barley and beet
 are grown to feed the stock in winter.
 When we visited the farm there were 22
 ewes and 20 calves. In the autumn Mr. 
 Crabbe buys in 700 store lambs. There 
 are only 2 tractors on the farm and   
 most of the work is contracted out. On
 a marshy piece of ground three ponds  
 had been dug out. The deepest is 9'   
 and the stream through the farm runs  
 through the ponds and keeps the water 
 very clean. 200 trout had been put in 
 the pond but the herons and cormorants
 had eaten most of them. Also on the   
 farm there are 2,500 chickens in an   
 intensive unit. The lane by the side  
 of the farm is called Butterfly Lane. </content>
