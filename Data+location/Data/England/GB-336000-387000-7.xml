		<content> In school we play {rounders, two balls
 and{1,2,3,}and out  of  school we play
{hide and seek.                        
 To play {rounders }you need about nine
 people,  one bowls,  one bats  and the
 rest are fielders.  The  bowler throws
 the ball, the batter bats the ball and
 if a fielder catches the ball they are
 out. Then the next person goes to bat.
 To  play {1,2,3 }you can  have as many
 people  as  you  want  as long as it's
 more than one.  You need one ball. One
 person  throws  the  ball up and if it
 bounces more than three times they are
 out, or if the other person catches it
 they are out.                         
 To  play {hide and seek }you  need  at
 least two  people. One  counts and the
 others hide and if the one  who counts
 sees the one who hides they run to the
 den and say  "Denny 1,2,3,"  and  then
 they will be "on".                    </content>
