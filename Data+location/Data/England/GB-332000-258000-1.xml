		<content> This block is mostly up land and sheep
 farming, most of the high land was    
 re-claimed during 1939 war.   Bradnor 
 Hill has a golf course and hundreds of
 players come to play.   A bus service 
 runs near by once a week.  Offas Dyke 
 runs through and attracts walkers from
 all over the country.   Knill Church  
 is open but has few worshipers.   A   
 flower festival is held some years,   
 when the local flower arrangers dress 
 the church windows to a choosen theme.
 This has proved successfull.
