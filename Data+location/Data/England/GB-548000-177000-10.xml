		<title>10RELIGION IN ERITH 1985</title>
		<content>  There are lots of different religions
 in the Erith area, non-Christian and  
 Christian, which are for both the long
 established and more recently arrived 
 peoples.                              
  Of the five Anglican churches, the   
 oldest, which was the parish church,  
 is St.John the Baptist, in West Street
 ,and has links with the first Domesday
 book. The original Catholic church was
 St.Fidelis, also in West Street. Both 
 parish churches are further south     
 today among the centres of housing.   
 The other Christian churches scattered
 in the area are the Pentecostal,      
 United Reform, Baptist and Christadel-
 phian churches.                       
  The non-Christian chuches are the    
 Sikh temple in the West Street area   
 among the Asians; the Jehovah's       
 Witness hall near Erith station; and  
 the Spiritualist church in Belvedere. </content>
