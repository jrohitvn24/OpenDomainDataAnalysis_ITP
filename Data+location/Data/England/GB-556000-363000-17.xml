		<title>17Busy Road in Skegness</title>
		<content> The busiest road in this area is Roman
 Bank. It starts at Skegness and ends  
 at Ingoldmells. It is busy because    
 people want to go to the beach. It    
 leads to other places as well like    
 Chapel and Boston.                    
 We did a traffic count along Roman    
 Bank. In five minutes there were 110  
 cars, 10 lorries and vans and 3 buses.
 It is busier in the summer because of 
 the visitors to the coast.            
 The road runs parallel to the coast   
 and has to be crossed to get to the   
 beach. We have a pelican crossing and 
 two zebra crossings in Winthorpe. We  
 also have a subway just outside.
