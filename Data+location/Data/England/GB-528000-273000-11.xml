		<content> On a typical school day I get up at   
 quarter to eight.I have a wash and    
 get dressed ,then I have my breakfast.
 After that I clean my teeth and set   
 off for school.                       
 The school that I go to is called     
 Thorndown Junior .It takes eleven     
 minutes for me to get to school.      
 In the school play ground I           
 meet my best friend Tracy Mckie .The  
 first thing we have is register.      
  It then depends on what day it is but
 it usually is maths from 9.15 until   
 10.10.Then we go in to the hall for   
 assembly .We then go out on to the    
 play ground for 15 minutes.           
 We then do language. It is then lunch 
 time.Then we go out on to the play    
 ground for one hour.After that we read
 silently for quarter of an hour.At the
 end of the day Mr Summerell reads us a
 story and I walk home.                </content>
