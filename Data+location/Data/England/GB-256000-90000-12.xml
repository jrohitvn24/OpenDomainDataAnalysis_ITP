		<content> Meldon Dam and Reservoir are found in 
 the valley of the West Okement River  
 3km to the west of Okehampton. The    
 site is on the northern edge of a     
 granite mass. Trail borings for the   
 foundations were started in 1963. By  
 1970 the river had been diverted      
 through a channel cut on the eastern  
 side of the valley. When the builders 
 started putting concrete in the       
 foundations construction materials    
 were brought from the nearby Meldon   
 Quarry. British Rail (owners of the   
 quarry) converted a stretch of old    
 railway line, including Meldon        
 Viaduct, between the quarry and       
 the dam site, into a road for this    
 traffic. In 1971 the river was        
 diverted through the new dam while the
 other half was built. The dam was     
 completed in 1972 and impounding of   
 water started. CONTINUED ON NEXT PAGE </content>
