		<title>05ST.PETERS CHURCH FRESHFORD</title>
		<content>     The church was built around 1250  
 in the centre of Freshford or         
 "Firfordia" as it was called then.    
     It was enlarged in 1450 when a new
 tower was built.The tower still       
 remains today and is decorated with   
 angels and other creatures.The church 
 was enlarged in 1630 with a north     
 aisle because an increase in cloth    
 manufacturing also meant an increase  
 in the population.In about 1730 this  
 aisle was fitted with a gallery.In    
 about 1800 the north aisle was made   
 larger because the population was     
 still increasing.There were many      
 changes during the 2nd half of the    
 19th century.The chancel was enlarged 
 in 1859,an organ was installed in 1868
 and the bells were recast in          
 1885.Today the church shares a rector 
 with Limpley Stoke and Hinton         
 Charterhouse.It can seat 220 people.  </content>
