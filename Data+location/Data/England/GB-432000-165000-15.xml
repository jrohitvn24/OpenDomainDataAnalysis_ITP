		<content> Public footpaths do not attract many  
 walkers, but one useful right of      
 way(as often, with no actual path) is 
 from the Common south-east to         
 Templeton. The map shows various      
 footpaths on the Common itself, though
 dog-walkers and others walk there     
 freely, a boon to townsfolk.          
 Hungerford seems to avoid extremes of 
 weather and is often clear of the snow
 seen lying on the downs to the south. 
 In recent years there has been a      
 general tendency to avoid the harsher 
 sprays on the land, and this area is  
 not noticeably troubled with          
 pollution. The presence of many       
 lichens testify to the purity of the  
 atmosphere.                           
 There is no nature reserve in the area
 and wildlife is normally found in the 
 hedgerows,trees fields and pastures   
 nearby.                               </content>
