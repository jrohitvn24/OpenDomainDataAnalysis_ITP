Quernmore School organises races for   
all the children in the school and     
parish. You can have pony rides or play
on the inflatable castle and there's   
always a queue for the swingboats.     
Mothers take their babies to the       
marquee for the Baby Show while older  
children  are spending their prize     
money on ice  cream and crisps.        
      Later on in the afternoon there  
is a Punch and Judy show for the       
younger children. Quernmore school     
girls enjoy a skittleball match and    
the boys a game of football. Sandwiches
and hot dogs are on sale and the young 
people get ready for one of their      
favourite sports, pillow fighting. The 
ones who have any energy left enter for
the Field races.
