   Marcham is in the District of the   
Vale of White Horse. Its nearest town  
is Abingdon. It is part of the valley  
of the River Thames, and most of the   
land is used for agriculture. Our      
picture (A) shows a typical view of the
country to the south of the village.   
This looks over the ground around the  
River Ock which joins the Thames at    
Abingdon.                              
   One of the main problems in Marcham 
is the road which runs through the     
narrowest part of the village. This is 
on a double bend and there have been a 
lot of accidents there. There is a     
picture of the bend(B). Because of the 
importance of this, we did a transport 
survey to find out about the cars      
people have in Marcham, and what       
journeys they did. This is at page 17.
