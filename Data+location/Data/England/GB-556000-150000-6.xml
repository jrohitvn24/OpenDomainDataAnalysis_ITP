		<title>06The Shelton Trencher.</title>
		<content> Mr Shelton,who lives at Underriver    
 Farm,has invented the Slit-trench     
 Digger,it is necessary on his farm    
 because his soil is clay, which is    
 difficult to drain properly.This      
 machine helps  with drainage          
 problems by making small trenches     
 which let the water run freely to     
 streams.                              
 He invented it in 1979 and he was     
 awarded a silver medal by the Royal   
 Agricultural Society of England.      
 The machines cost between             
 Â£2600-Â£8600.As it uses plastic piping 
 it keeps the fields looking smart.New 
 drainage ware has been brought out    
 recently which keeps out small stones 
 allowing the water to run freely.This 
 resembles an egg box with a filter.It 
 is the only place in the world where  
 this machine is made,making it unique.
