<title>21Sandall Beat Wood</title>
<content>The 1986 article is wrong. Sandall Beat Wood was planted in the early years of the last century on open land, and a patchwork of heath, fen, and rough pasture. This afforestation was part of a national campaign during the Napoleonic Wars, to provide timber for ship building. In 1809 Doncaster Town Council ordered 'Slater the Woodman' to buy many thousands of tree seedlings - a mixture of Larch, Oak, Ash, Beech, Sweet Chestnut, Scots Pine, Lime and Elm. To prepare the land for planting, drainage channels were dug in criss-cross fashion - 365 in all. Planting began in 1810 and continued during 1811 and 1812.&#xd;

The young trees flourished, and by the end of the century both fen and heath were gradually disappearing. Now only a small area of fen still remains on the eastern edge of the wood, and the open heath has more or less vanished - Source Doncaster Council Online
