		<title>01HOLLINGBOURNE TO HARRIETSHAM</title>
		<content>     The area covered by this D-block  
 is dominated by the North Downs which 
 traverse it from the north-west corner
 to the south-east corner.The North    
 Downs have their steep slope on the   
 southern side and at the foot of this 
 slope lies the old medieval centre of 
 Hollingbourne Village,mentioned in the
 original Domesday Survey,with its     
 church and impressive manor house.    
     In the south-east corner of the   
 block lie the outskirts of the        
 village of Harrietsham,its parish     
 church,St. John the Baptist,and the   
 imposing Stede Hill House which has   
 occupied its elevated position on the 
 chalk hills for at least the last     
 three and a half centuries.Between the
 two run the ancient trackways of the  
 Pilgrim's Way and the North Downs Way 
 and on either side hamlets dotted     
 around beautiful farmhouses.          </content>
