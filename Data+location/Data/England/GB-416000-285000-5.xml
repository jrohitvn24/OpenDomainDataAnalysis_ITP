		<title>05Housing in Chelmsley Wood</title>
		<content> There are four different types of     
 housing in Chelmsley Wood. Houses 43%,
 bungalows and other buildings 12%. The
 average rent is Â£16.79 and the average
 price of houses in the area is        
 Â£18,000-Â£19,000. Two thirds of all    
 tenants receive help of some form.    
 Unemployment is high in the area and  
 problems occur when paying rent.      
 However, old age pensioners are said  
 to be the best payers! Caretakers are 
 employed to manage some of the council
 flats and maisonettes and the council 
 also provides a warden service for the
 elderly living in flats and bungalows.
 Between 1982 and 1987 the council will
 have demolished 350 flats and         
 maisonettes of around 25 years old. At
 present flats and maisonettes account 
 for 45% of the total housing of       
 Chelmsley Wood.
