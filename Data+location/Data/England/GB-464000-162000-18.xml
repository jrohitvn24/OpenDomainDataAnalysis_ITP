 station was converted into a copse    
 with 19{balsam poplars;}there are     
 also six{ash}and six{maple}along the  
 new road fencing planted 1977-78.     
 Since then determined efforts have    
 been made to establish trees in the   
 fairground area, and around the two   
 ponds. In spite of vandalism, drought 
 and poor soil, 70 trees now flourish, 
 including{chestnut, willow, maple,    
{ash}with some thirty trees planted in 
 the early seventies.{Tree "clippings"
