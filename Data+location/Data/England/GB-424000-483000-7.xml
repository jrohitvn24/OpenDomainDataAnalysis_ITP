		<title>07Houses in Snape, Yorkshire</title>
		<content>   The village of Snape developed on   
 either side of the village green with 
 the beck running through the middle.It
 is a long village nearly one kilometre
 from the Castle to the last house.    
   Houses in Snape are of different    
 design but are mostly of sandstone.The
 old houses have very thick walls and  
 most have roofs of red tiles.Many     
 cottages have been renovated, but if  
 you look carefully, you can see a few 
 old,horizontally-sliding sash windows.
   Old photographs show some cottages  
 with thatched roofs.                  
   Of 120 houses in the village,18 were
 built in the last 10 years.
