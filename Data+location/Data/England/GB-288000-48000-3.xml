		<title>03Beacon Lane,Kingswear.</title>
		<content> Beacon Lane is about half a mile long.
 It follows the River Dart and         
 overlooks the estuary on the Kingswear
 side.It is a very old road,dating back
 to Saxon times,and was part of the    
 main road to Brixham. In 1765 the     
 inland road to Brixham was improved   
 and Beacon Lane became quiet and      
 overgrown. The road takes its name    
 from the beacon which guides ships    
 into Dartmouth harbour. A new         
 automatic beacon was built in 1980 to 
 replace an old stone tower which had  
 stood for a hundred years. Beacon Lane
 today is a very wealthy road. The     
 first three houses near the church are
 small stone cottages,but the rest are 
 large and expensive and all face the  
 river. Many of these have been made   
 into flats and some gardens have been 
 used for modern houses.
