		<content> Winmarleigh,with its scattered 250    
 or so people,is like many another     
 small community ,highly organised.    
 If one wishes one can make committees 
 one's hobby there being some 10 such  
 bodies at least in the parish.        
 As covered above the Parish Council is
 the local body for matters temporal.  
 The 'spiritual' equivalent is the     
{Parochial Church Council}of S.Luke's  
 Parish Church.The church is in{the}   
{Garstang Deanery}and the{Diocese of   
{Blackburn.}                           
 The P.C.C. meets about once a month in
 the school and attempts to keep the   
 church in Winmarleigh solvent by      
 organising fund raising and by vetting
 the accounts,and, at the same time in 
 helping the Vicar,Roger Hamblin,in the
 running of this part of the combined  
 benefice.The possible further merger  
 with Glasson is viewed with concern.  </content>
