		<title>02An Interview with P.C. Brake</title>
		<content> On May 1st we interviewed one of our  
 local policemen.He said "In Twyford   
 last year about 426 crimes were       
 committed and this year 140.In our    
 area the most frequent crime is car   
 stealing and the least frequent is    
 rape.The most dangerous crime you     
 could deal with is when your life is  
 at risk,but the only thing that has   
 happened to me is being trapped       
 between two cars.You can also have    
 very embarrassing moments.Mine was    
 when I first started and everyone     
 stared at me.Even though I have not   
 dealt with any murders I have seen a  
 lot of corpses.When I was a boy my    
 ambition was to become a policeman    
 because on the walls were posters     
 saying"Join the police force".On a    
 typical day we first go to the office,
 book up on a shift, lock up the       
 station and set off on our duties."   </content>
