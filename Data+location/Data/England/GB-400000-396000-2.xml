		<title>02FAMILY LIFE SURVEY 1</title>
		<content> A survey was carried out amongst      
 pupils at Longdendale Community School
 who live in Hollingworth, Cheshire.   
 The survey revealed the following     
 facts:                                
    Most families had lived in the     
 village for over five years and most  
 of them lived in terraced houses which
 were owner occupied. The average size 
 of each family was 4-5 people.        
                                       
    Most families have a car which is  
 used for travelling to work or just   
 for pleasure.                         
                                       
    Almost every family has a washing  
 machine, television and record player.
 Video recorders and microwave ovens   
 are quite popular too. Of those who   
 have a video recorder the majority do 
 not belong to a Vidoe Club.
