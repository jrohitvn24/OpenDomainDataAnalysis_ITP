		<content> THE VILLAGES OF HORSFORD AND FELTHORPE
 ARE ANCIENT SETTLEMENTS. THEY REMAINED
 SMALL VILLAGES FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS. 
 HORSFORD WAS A CROSSING POINT ON THE  
 ROUTE TO NORWICH. THE DEVELOPMENT OF  
 THE MOTOR CAR CHANGED ITS FUNCTION AND
 THE SIZE OF THE VILLAGE . MOST PEOPLE 
 WORK IN NORWICH AND USE CARS FOR      
 TRANSPORT,THE VILLAGES HAVE BECOME    
 DORMITORIES. ACCESS TO THE MAIN ROAD  
 HAS BEEN IMPORTANT SO DEVELOPMENT HAS 
 TAKEN PLACE ALONG IT, (RIBBON         
 DEVELOPMENT). THE COMMUNITES ARE      
 MODERATELY WELL SERVED BY LOCAL SHOPS 
 AND THERE ARE LARGE STORES IN NORWICH.
 THERE ARE PLAYING FIELDS, VILLAGE     
 HALLS, CHURCHES AND PUBS IN BOTH      
 VILLAGES. IN THESE, MANY COMMUNITY    
 EVENTS TAKE PLACE. ALTHOUGH THERE ARE 
 A FEW OLDER BUILDINGS, THE GREATER    
 MAJORITY ARE LESS THAN 20 YEARS OLD.
