		<content>  Our survey area in{Washington,Tyne   
{and Wear}includes 4 or 5 villages and 
 two industrial estates.The block is   
 split by the{A1 Motorway}and other    
 highways which are surrounded by      
 several{new housing estates.}Some     
 houses are private and are in a       
 varying price range,others are owned  
 by the Council.Housing development is 
 increasing.There are large wooded     
 areas on the banks of the{River Wear. 
  As this was once a{mining area}there 
 are the remains of pits and old       
 colliery railway lines.               
  Policy has been to provide all       
 villages with their own facilities for
{leisure,education and shopping,}while 
 transport to the town centre is also  
 provided.                             
  In the southern section is{Lambton   
{Park and Castle.
