		<title>07FAMILY LIFE IN DURHAM</title>
		<content>  The average family owns a modern well
 equipped home with an average of two  
 or three children,so that nursery     
 education is in great demand.         
  Often both parents work and children 
 will be taken to school by car,most   
 families owning one,after breakfast.  
 The traditional bacon and eggs meal is
 now often a weekend treat,making way  
 for the quicker one of cereal &amp; toast 
 with tea or coffee. Mothers at home   
 have a busy day with young children &amp; 
 pets,especially a dog which needs     
 exercise,housework,cooking &amp; shopping.
 Working parents eat out at lunchtime  
 and children have a meal at school.   
  Families gather again for an evening 
 meal,often eaten viewing TV.At week-  
 ends main shopping is done together   
 and leisure pursuits such as sport,   
 gardening,visiting and entertaining   
 are enjoyed.                          </content>
