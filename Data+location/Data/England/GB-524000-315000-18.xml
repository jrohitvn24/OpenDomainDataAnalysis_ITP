		<title>18FARM VISIT</title>
		<content>        On 22nd May 1985 we went to Mr 
 Cookes farm on Deeping High Bank. Mr  
 Cooke has 7 SHIRE HORSES. The first   
 thing we did was to look at his       
 prize-winning horse CHARM and her foal
 who is about 8 weeks old. CHARM is    
 about 10 years old  and has won the   
 Lincolnshire show, the Royal Show and 
 Wembly three years running. CHARM has 
 a sister who has a foal 12 weeks      
 old.Horses are sold to America and    
 Canada and people come across the     
 world to see them. When horses are    
 entered for shows his daughter plaits 
 their mains and tails.                
      As well as horses, the farm has  
 cattle and sheep and a donkey. He has 
 300 acres of land and 7 tractors and 6
 ploughs to work this.                 
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
