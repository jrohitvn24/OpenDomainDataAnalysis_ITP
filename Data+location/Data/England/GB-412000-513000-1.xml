		<title>01OVINGTON AND NEIGHBOURHOOD</title>
		<content> Ovington is a small quiet village     
 having a population of about 130. Many
 of the old stone built houses are     
 clustered around or near to the       
 village green, although a small numger
 of modern dwelling have been provided 
 on the edge of the village. The inn   
 and the village hall provide the      
 centres for the community's relaxation
 and social activities; the post office
 provides basic village shop           
 commodities. The parish church is     
 about 2 miles away. Ovington is       
 situated in delightfully unspoilt open
 countryside in which the River Tees is
 a particularly attractive feature. The
 land is almost entirely devoted to    
 farming. Most of the land is arable   
 providing grain, oil seed and root    
 crops. However, some grassland caters 
 for sheep and cattle. Many of the     
 population are employed on the land,  </content>
