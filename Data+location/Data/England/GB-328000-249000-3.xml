		<title>03EARDISLEY HOUSING &amp; TRAFFIC</title>
		<content> Many of the{houses}in Eardisley are   
 black and white .By the pump is a     
 14th.century house called Cruck house 
 because the{cruck beams}can be seen.  
 Another 14th. century building is     
 Upper House Farm,it has a Monk's room,
 as it may have been built as a        
 religious foundation.There are a few  
{modern}houses,24{Council houses}and 18
{old peoples bungalows}. Recently two  
 long barns have been converted into   
 rows of black and white terraced      
 houses.                               
 We did a{traffic survey}of the road   
 outside school.We sat outside for 1hr.
 in the morning and 1hr.in the         
 afternoon.We found there was more     
 traffic in the afternoon than in the  
 morning.Over 65% of the traffic on    
 both occasions were cars.Most of the  
 other vehicles were local lorries or  
 vans or from Wales and the Midlands.  </content>
