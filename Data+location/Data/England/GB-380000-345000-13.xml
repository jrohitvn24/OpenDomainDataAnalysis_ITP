		<title>13Good Health in Silverdale</title>
		<content>Silverdale Health Centre is close to   
the shops.It is open every weekday     
morning and every evening except       
Thursday.At weekends it is closed,but  
there is a relief doctor if you are    
desperate for attention.               
The five doctors cope with common      
ailments such as coughs and colds.If   
the illness is more serious the patient
is sent to a specialist doctor at the  
North Staffs Royal Infirmary.          
The Health visitor has her office at   
the centre.She attends to mothers      
with young babies or she might visit   
old people to give them baths or help  
them to fill in forms.                 
There is a chiropodist who attends to  
corns and bunions on one day a week.An 
antenatal clinic is open every Tuesday.
The babies are examined and            
weighed.Mums can buy cheap baby food   
and vitamins.                          </content>
