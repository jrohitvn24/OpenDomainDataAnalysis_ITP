		<title>17ARTS IN SOUTHSEA</title>
		<content>   Craftwork has become increasingly   
 popular as the rate of unemployment   
 has risen, especially traditionally   
 male crafts such as{fretwork,         
{marquetry and carving.}Other local    
 crafts people produce{quilted clothes,
{lacework,corn idols,jewellery,spinning
 and{smocking.}One problem is that     
 materials can be expensive.The work is
 of a high standard. One man has carved
 for the Royal Family and Princess     
 Anne's daughter wears dresses smocked 
 by a local needlewoman.               
   Most{local artwork}is done by       
 retired people, who like to paint     
 landscapes,traditional seascapes and  
 harbour scenes.                       
   Unfortunately there seems to be     
 little interest in art in Southsea    
 despite the nearby art college.Local  
 galleries such as Hiscocks are closing
 down.                                 </content>
