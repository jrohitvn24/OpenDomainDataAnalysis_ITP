		<content>      Fish Market by Steven Pickin     
 In the morning the trawlers come      
 around the stone built breakwater, the
 sea gulls argue over everything.      
 Once in the market the fish are       
 weighed and packed ready for sale.    
 The price differs according to the    
 kind of fish.The trawlers come in at  
 any time at all during the day.       
 My uncle owns two trawlers and one    
 crabber. I have been out on the       
 crabber twice, it is "ace"!One of the 
 crab pots had six crabs in it , two   
 spider crabs and four edible ones.In  
 Britain the edible crabs are the most 
 popular , but in France it is the     
 spider crabs that they like to eat    
 best.                                 
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
