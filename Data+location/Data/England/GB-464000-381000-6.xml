		<title>06CONSERVATION, RANBY AREA</title>
		<content>   In an area such as this, where soils
 are light and arid, and where wind    
 erosion is a problem, conservation is 
 particularly important. In addition,  
 the pressure to make farming          
 profitable, leads to a tendency to    
 create larger fields by removing      
 hedgerows, to plough wherever         
 possible, and to use large quantities 
 of chemical sprays.                   
   One farmer's opinion is that to farm
 successfully here, top priority had to
 be given to schemes of irrigation and 
 wind-break. This farmer also has an   
 interest in wild life, and to protect 
 it has left the heads of several      
 fields unsprayed. This will reduce the
 yield by as much as one third but he  
 considers the sacrifice worthwhile. He
 recently observed some baby partridges
 which had hatched on one of the       
 unsprayed areas.                      </content>
