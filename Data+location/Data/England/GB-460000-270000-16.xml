Two years ago the Cricket Club felt    
they had to involve the village in     
their activities if they were to       
survive.                               
A six-a-side competition was announced 
for groups within the village. The     
Church, individual streets, the local  
ladies hockey team and even one family 
entered. The weather was wonderful and 
was a great success.                   
This year the event was repeated. More 
teams entered making it another        
successful day.                        
This year too, the Club won a similar  
competition for local Cricket Clubs.   
The cloud hanging over the future of   
the Club is the possible loss of the   
use of the rented playing field. So the
next priority is the enormous task of  
trying to raise the money to buy the   
playing field.                         </content>
