		<title>10HIGH HURSTWOOD C.E. SCHOOL</title>
		<content> In the last 10 years the roll of the  
 village primary school has dropped    
 from 104 to 35 with 2 full-time and   
 one part-time teacher instead of 4.   
 The drop in numbers is mainly due to  
 lack of children in a village where   
 there is little population movement.  
 The school is well equipped with      
 audio-visual aids, its own swimming   
 pool and a kitchen on site which means
 dinners are cooked on the premises.   
 Annual events include a Sports Day,   
 Concert and plays at Christmas. There 
 are educational visits and the local  
 environment is studied. Links with the
 Church are maintained by special      
 services for the children at          
 Festivals. The school's happy family  
 atmosphere enhances the life of pupils
 and the community. It would be sad if 
 it had to close.
