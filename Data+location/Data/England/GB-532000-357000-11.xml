		<content> There are lots of different kinds of  
 games we play when we are at home.I   
 enjoy Monopoly because you get Â£1,500 
 in paper money.To play the game you   
 use two dice.If you land on a square  
 you can buy the property.If you buy   
 four of the houses you can take them  
 off and buy a hotel.The hotels are    
 red and the houses are green.If       
 another person lands on the property  
 they have to pay a fee of money.      
      Some games we invent             
 ourselves.You can make up good games  
 with toy cars.You can make ramps which
 cars will jump over.You can pretend   
 that they are on fire and you can get 
 a fire engine and make pretend fire   
 out of cardboard and colour it in red 
 and yellow.You can play stuntmen and  
 pretend they jump the Grand Canyon by 
 putting a ramp up on a cardboard      
 box.                                  </content>
