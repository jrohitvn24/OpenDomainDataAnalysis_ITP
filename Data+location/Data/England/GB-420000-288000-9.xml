		<title>09Coleshill church tower.</title>
		<content> The tower door was open,through it was
 the long steep climb up to the spire. 
 The steep steps spiralled upwards.    
 Thefront of the steps were worn       
 slightly away where many feet had     
 trodden.{Ninety seven steps!}Near to  
 the top it was cold,dark and scary.   
 In some places there were no lights or
 handrail.The spiralling and darkness  
 caused dizziness.At the top.Miles     
 around Coleshill could be seen,new and
 old Coleshill,{Hams Hall power station
 ,the motorway and countryside.Many    
 noises could be heard,industrial      
 machinery,bangs,crashes and motor     
 vehicles.Engraved in the stone was    
 1865,CHC 1903 and Woldfield 1880. Most
 of the sandstone is black and decayed 
 were two pillars were restored .The   
 counter balance for the{cockerel}could
 be seen inside the spire.Coleshill had
 changed but the church had not.       </content>
