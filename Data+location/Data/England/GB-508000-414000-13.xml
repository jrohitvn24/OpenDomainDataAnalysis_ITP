		<content> My favourite subject is athletics. I  
 belong to Cleethorpes Athletics Club  
 but I can't remember how long I have  
 been going there. In all the clubs    
 there are different age groups and    
 boys and girls don't run together. The
 lowest groups are the minor boys and  
 the minor girls. When you get older   
 the boys go into the "Colts" and the  
 girls to the "Girls". I'm in the minor
 group but I train with the "Girls"    
 because most of the minors are 5, 6, 7
 or 8 and I am lO. We start training   
 just after six o'clock and we finish  
 at about quarter past seven. We train 
 every Tuesday and Thursday. After we  
 have done our training we can buy a   
 drink. Cups of orange are 5p, coffee  
 and tea are 5p and lOp. In the Summer 
 we race against other clubs on a track
 but in Winter we do cross-country. I  
 have won  medals track racing.        </content>
