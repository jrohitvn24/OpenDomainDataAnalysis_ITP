		<title>05A Home In Congresbury</title>
		<content> My home is quite small. It has three  
 bedrooms, a dining room, a small room,
 a bathroom and a kitchen. It has a    
 back garden with an old shed in it. It
 has a front garden with a drive       
 running up the side of it. It has nine
 windows. We have been living here ever
 since I started school. Out of the    
 window in the dining room you can see 
 the motorway (M5), hedges, trees,     
 fields and the odd house. Out of the  
 kitchen window you can see hedges,    
 trees and the river bank. Sometimes   
 you can see boats going along the     
 Bristol Channel. I have got two       
 rabbits, a dog and a horse. I like    
 living here. There is more room to    
 play than in the town and space to    
 walk the dog.
