		<title>17Boston Stump's Caretaker</title>
		<content> On an interview of the caretaker of   
{Boston Stump}I asked him what he      
 actually did he replied that he was   
 the Guardian of the Tower.That means  
 he lets people up the tower.Even      
 though he is the caretaker he visits  
 the church everyday.The oldest thing  
 in the Stump is the Sancutary Knocker.
 It's more than 900yrs old.The         
 caretaker enjoys his job because its  
 interesting and he meets interesting  
 people.Americans visit mostly this is 
 because their Boston is named after   
 ours.It takes Â£400,000 to maintain the
 stump.Masons of different Guilds built
 it.The Cotton Chapel got its name     
 after the priest John Cotton.The stump
 can hold 2000 people.It was built in  
 1309. The ghost of the Grey Lady is   
 only a myth.There is no danger of the 
 stump falling down.                   
                                       </content>
