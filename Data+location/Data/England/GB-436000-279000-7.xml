		<title>07STOKE HOUSE</title>
		<content>  Stoke House is a 200 year old        
 building.Before it became an          
 observation and assessment centre a   
 man called Harvey who was a leather   
 merchant and then a solicitor by the  
 name of John Brown Twist (1809-1885)  
 owned the house.He was an important   
 man and was the director of the Gas   
 Company and Coventry Canal and he was 
 a respected churchman.                
 The old house had a stable and a      
 cobbled courtyard and is original     
 apart from the fire doors.In 1939-1945
 it was used as a balloon barrage unit.
 After the war it became a children's  
 home but in 1977 Patrick Jenkin opened
 a new block for children who are      
 disruptive or have problems.Now there 
 are five teachers and 30 carestaff.The
 age range of the children is from     
 about 11 to 19.
