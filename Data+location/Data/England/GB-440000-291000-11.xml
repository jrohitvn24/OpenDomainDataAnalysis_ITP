		<content> BROWNIES                              
  The fourth Burbage Brownies are a    
 very friendly pack we meet every      
 Monday at Sketchley Hill School.At    
 Brownie meetings we come in,take off  
 ourcoats and go to our corners. The   
 pack is divided into four groups      
 called sixes lead by a sixer.         
  Our sixes are called the Gnomes,the  
 Elves, the Sprites and the Imps.Each  
 six tries to win points by dressing   
 and behaving correctly and working    
 hard.The six with the most points over
 six weeks wins the shield for next six
 weeks.                                
  Our leaders give us the points, then 
 we play a game.This is followed by    
 Brownie ring  where we pay twenty     
 pence subs,then often this is followed
 by craft with felt.Sometimes we go for
 walks or go swimming.
