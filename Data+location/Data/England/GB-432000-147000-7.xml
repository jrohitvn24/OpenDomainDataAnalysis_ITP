		<title>07MOTHER MAY I</title>
		<content> The game "Mother May I" needs eight   
 people, seven will be the days of the 
 week and the last one is a caller.    
 The caller tells the players what     
 movements to make.  The movements are:
 Giant Steps which are the biggest     
 steps possibly managed, Fairy Steps   
 which makes the heel touch the toe.   
 Ladder is when one person lies on the 
 floor.  Another is called Umbrella    
 when a player twirls around and heads 
 towards the caller until 'stop' is    
 called.  Trip to London and Back Again
 is when a weekday runs or walks       
 depending on whether the caller says  
 fast or slow, then a weekday runs from
 a place round the caller and keeps    
 running until the caller says stop.   
 The object of the game is to reach the
 caller before anybody else in order to
 become caller in the next game.
