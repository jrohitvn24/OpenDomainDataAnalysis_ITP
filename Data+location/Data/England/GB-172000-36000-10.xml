		<title>10Housing in Stithians.</title>
		<content> Stithians is almost entirely          
 residential with a large variety of   
 properties. Some of the houses are    
 over a hundred years old. There are   
 bungalows, terraced, detached and     
 semi-detached houses, usually lived in
 by owner occupiers. There are two     
 council estates as well as a new      
 private estate which is still being   
 built.Some tenants from the council   
 estate near the church have started   
 buying their houses.There is also some
 property which is let privately all   
 the year round and some which is      
 rented out to holiday makers.All the  
 houses have gardens, though some,     
 especially on the council estates, are
 quite small. There are no factories or
 blocks of flats, though there are a   
 few flats where a large property has  
 been converted. The shops are         
 converted houses.                     </content>
