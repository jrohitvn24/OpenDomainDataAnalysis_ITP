{Railway                               
{By Paul Griffiths and Joanna Hoare    
 The railway behind Jedburgh drive has 
 been closed down for twenty years.It  
 opened in the eighteen fifties and    
 closed in the nineteen sixties.It was 
 used to carry passengers to Barnard   
 Castle and goods to the chemical      
 works.Now no one cares about it any   
 more they just throw old rags and     
 furniture away.There are lots of bolts
 and the wooden sleepers.There are lots
 of chairs which are things that hold  
 the track together.At West Auckland   
 Road the old bridge has been knocked  
 down because it would fall down and   
 some people could have an             
 accident.At the other side of West    
 Auckland Road where all the works are 
 there is still some railway track.
