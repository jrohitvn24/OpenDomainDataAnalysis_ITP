		<title>15A Five Year Old's Life.</title>
		<content>   I live in Fair Hill.  I am just     
 five.  It was a big field before the  
 houss and bungalows were made and we  
 used to have fairs twice a year here. 
 They were held the last Wednesday in  
 April and 17th November.  The last one
 was in November 1939.  The field was  
 called Home Field. There are 19 homes 
 here. A few days it rains and quite a 
 lot of days it is sunny. There are    
 only a few cars going up and down this
 way.  We go out quite a lot.  We go   
 each Sunday to see Daddy at work on   
 the Mendips. We like it very much up  
 here.  I have got a lot of toys.  I   
 like my toys very much.  Each day I   
 come home from school, I play with my 
 toys until tea time.  The teas I like 
 are fish and chips or lamb chops.  I  
 have got so many toys that I have not 
 enough time to play with them all.
