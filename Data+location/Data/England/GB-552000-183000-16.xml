		<title>16WOODLANDS</title>
		<content> Immediately behind our school we have 
 a small wood.  There are different    
 kinds of trees like Oak, Rowan,       
 Sycamore and  Elderberry.  We went to 
 measure the height of the trees with a
 clinometer.  The Sycamore is l2       
 metres, Rowan 18metres and the Oak    
 tree is l3 metres.  The smallest is   
 the Elderberry at 7 metres.  Some of  
 the Oak trees in our woods are l00    
 years old.  We have got some wild     
 flowers like Cow Parsley.  Cow Parsley
 can be called Lady's Lace.  It has got
 thin stems and white flowers.  There  
 are lots of minibeasts.  When we went 
 down in the Woods we found Wood Lice, 
 Slugs, beetles and Frog Hoppers.      
 There are also different fungi in the 
 wood, one is called Birch Bracket     
 which grows on dead trees - it is     
 brown and white.
