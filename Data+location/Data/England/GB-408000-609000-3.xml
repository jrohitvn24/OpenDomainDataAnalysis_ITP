		<content> This small corner of Northumberland is
 a most attractive piece of country.   
 The land here consists of rolling     
 country with a large wood of mixed    
 trees and part of a larger forest of  
 conifers. The land is grassland used  
 for grazing cattle and sheep, very    
 little of it is flat. The area is     
 traversed in a roughly north - south  
 direction by two streams (known in    
 this county as burns), the Coe Burn   
 and the Edlingham Burn; both of which 
 join the River Aln about 1 km to      
 the north of the area. There are just 
 two roads, again north - south in     
 direction. One of these in the west of
 the area, is the main road from       
 Newcastle via Morpeth and Wooler to   
 Coldstream and Edinburgh (A697). The  
 other is a tiny country road from     
 Edlingham to the village of Bolton.
