		<title>12Ecology: Wray, Roeburndale</title>
		<content> Wray has temperate weather. But       
 sometimes in winter, families on the  
 fells are snowed in for days, and most
 of the year there is plenty of rain.  
 This unspoilt area of rolling hills,  
 nurtured by the Rivers Hindburn and   
 Roeburn, is a haven for wildlife.     
 There are roe deer, hares, rabbits,   
 hedgehogs, moles and shrews; rats and 
 mice in the barns; grey squirrels in  
 abundance among the deciduous woods   
 and red squirrels are sometimes seen; 
 foxes are prolific and considered a   
 pest by gamekeepers; there are        
 weasels, stoats, mink, some badgers,  
 and the occasional otter. Among the   
 many species of birds, there are      
 owls, dippers, grouse, pheasant.      
 Footpaths weave across the fields     
 and by the riverside, winding through 
 beautiful countryside to picturesque  
 places, often linking isolated houses.</content>
