		<title>15Farming in the area.</title>
		<content>  Our area is a very rural one.Most of 
 the land is farm land except for the  
 village of Grampound-with-Creed.Most  
 of the farms have been in the same    
 family for generations.There is one   
 farm that belongs to the council and  
 different tenants farm it.            
  At Garlenick farm there is a pheasant
 breeding programme as well as the more
 normal type of mixed farming.Cows are 
 bred and there is a small herd of     
 bulls.The game keeper is kept very    
 busy rearing stock for shooting       
 parties.                              
  Ventonwyn farm has just been sold    
 after belonging to  the same family   
 for generations.It had a reputation   
 for its prize cow herd.               
  All the farms in the area do mixed   
 farming.At Bartilever farm they grow  
 one unusual crop-corn on the cob.This 
 farm has the biggest farm house.      </content>
