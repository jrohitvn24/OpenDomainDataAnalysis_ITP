		<title>10ARKWRIGHT HOUSE,PRESTON</title>
		<content>     Arkwright House was built in 1728 
 in Stoneygate, Preston. It is the     
 oldest house in Preston and it        
 belonged to the headmaster of the old 
 Grammar School. In 1768 Richard       
 Arkwright rented a room there and     
 invented and built the Water Frame. In
 1840 it became a public house called  
 the Arkwright Arms. In 1890 it was    
 bought by the Temperance movement and 
 became a lodging house for homeless   
 people. From 1950 to 1978 it was      
 derelict. Restored by 1980, it was    
 opened by H.R.H. Princess Alexandra.  
 It is now used by W.R. Tuson College  
 as an adult education centre. They do 
 English as a second language, Art and 
 Design courses, and 'A' and 'O' level 
 exams.
