		<title>07BOLSOVER COMMUNITY HOSPITAL.</title>
		<content>      The idea of a community hospital 
 to serve the Bolsover area was first  
 suggested in 1982. Work on the actual 
 site was begun in 1985 and the        
 hospital is due to open in 1987. The  
 hospital is the responsibility of the 
 Trent Regional Health Authority and   
 will cost three and a half million    
 pounds to build while running costs   
 are calculated at a further million   
 pounds per year.                      
      The Marlpit Lane site was        
 selected because it was the only      
 available area of flat land close     
 enough to the town centre to ensure   
 easy access for the elderly and       
 infirm.                               
      It is expected that the hospital 
 will be used by people from           
 Bolsover,Shirebrook, Creswell, Clowne 
 and the surrounding small villages.
