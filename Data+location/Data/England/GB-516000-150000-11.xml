		<title>11Old Peoples Home-Dorking NE</title>
		<content>   Because{medical care}is improving   
 all the time,people live to be much   
 older now and there is more need for  
 homes for the old people ,who can't be
 looked after by their families.       
   We visited an old people's home.It  
 had beautiful surroundings and the    
 house was large and airy.             
   The home's oldest resident is 93.The
 home can cater for{21 people}living   
 there.                                
   There is a{special chair}for the    
 residents who can't walk up the       
 stairs.                               
   In the day residents read,knit,talk 
 and go to visit relations.At the      
 weekend they get most visitors.       
   Most of the old people are fit and  
 heathly.There is a large cat as the   
 home's pet.                           
   The old peoples home employ{7 staff 
 altogether.                           </content>
