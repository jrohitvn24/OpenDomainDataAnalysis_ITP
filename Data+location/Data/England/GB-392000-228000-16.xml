		<title>16Hardy Rd. area. Our survey.</title>
		<content>      The Hardy road area is made up   
 mostly of small bungalows. The people 
 we interviewed liked living in the    
 area because "it is a nice quiet and  
 pleasant environment". One elderly    
 lady said "I like the area because it 
 doesn't have any{'Punk Rockers'}or    
 vandals". Punk Rockers are young      
 people who wear very bright clothes   
 and often dye their hair different    
 colours. They are sometimes very      
 shocking to look at and old people are
 a little frightened by them.          
        The old people have to walk    
 about a quarter of a mile to get to   
 the shops which are in the centre of  
 Bishops Cleeve. This causes a problem 
 for some of the people we interviwed  
 because it meant having to cross the  
 increasingly busy and dangerous       
 Station road.
