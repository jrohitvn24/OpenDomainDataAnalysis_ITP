		<content>   Two brooks converge in the centre of
 Blakeney and they are under constant  
 threat from industrial pollution. In  
 1984 all fish and subsequently a heron
 died as a result of extensive caustic 
 acid poisoning.                       
   Nuclear power stations, just across 
 the R. Severn, routinely discharge    
 radioactive particles into the        
 atmosphere but the main discharge is  
 into the river. A cluster of childhood
 leukaemias was found in a nearby area 
 this side of the river in 1978-82 and 
 families involved had close ties with 
 the river. It is difficult to tell    
 what the true hazards of radioactive  
 pollution are as the effects of       
 contamination can take up to 2 decades
 to emerge but as these leukaemias were
 found some 20 years after the stations
 were built, concern in the minds of   
 some inhabitants is understandable.   </content>
