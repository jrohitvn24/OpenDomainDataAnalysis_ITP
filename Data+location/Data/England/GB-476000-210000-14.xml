In Stone there is very little crime.   
There is one Policeman who looks after 
the village,it is his special          
responsibility. He comes into school   
sometimes to talk about the police     
force and the job they do in           
Buckinghamshire.                       
Although he is the village policeman he
is based at Aylesbury Police Station   
and has other tasks to do aswell.      
 The road through Stone is straight    
and the speed limit is 40m.p.h. this   
seems to cause alot of accidents which 
take up his time.                      
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
