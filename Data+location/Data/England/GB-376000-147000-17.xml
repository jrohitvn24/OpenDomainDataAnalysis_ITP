		<content> I get up at 8.00, get dressed &amp; have  
 my breakfast. I go upstairs, tidy my  
 bedroom, brush my teeth &amp; wash. I go  
 downstairs &amp; put my lunch in my bag.  
 I go to school at 9.00.  My class is  
 class 1. First we go to assembly.     
 Mr. Giles, our headmaste usually      
 reads a story about Jesus.  On        
 Fridays a class usually does assembly.
 After that we do maths or spellings   
 until breaktime. I have a packet of   
 crisps. Then we do our project until  
 dinner time.  For dinner I have       
 sandwiches.  Dinner starts at l2.15   
 until l.30 and within that time we    
 have 2 sittings.  The 1st. is dinner  
 but sandwiches for the infants, the   
 2nd. is for the older sandwiches.     
 After dinner we sometimes have a      
 mental test.  After that we do corr-  
 ections, or handwriting.  After play  
 we have a story until 3.30. (St.Johns)</content>
