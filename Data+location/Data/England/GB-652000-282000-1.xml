		<title>01BANACRE BROAD AND MARSHES</title>
		<content> This coastal strip of land is bounded 
 to the north by grazing marshes now   
 no longer used as such and slowly     
 reverting to nature. To the south in  
 Benacre Broad, a small open stretch of
 water surrounded by reeds. This forms 
 a sanctury for wildlife of all kinds. 
 The area is flat and bounded on the   
 east by a pebbly beach which suffers  
 erosion by the sea to the south, but  
 seems to hold its own at the northern 
 end where the Hundred River enters the
 sea through a sluice.
