		<title>02Farming on Todmorden Moor</title>
		<content> The area is rough moorland grass which
 has been enclosed in parts for pasture
 land.                                 
 My name is{Robert Sutcliffe}and my dad
 owns about 1000 acres in the area and 
 rents another 150 acres.Until this    
 year we kept{sheep}and a few{Hereford}
{cattle}but now we have only the       
 sheep.Our flock is around 350 made up 
 of a variety of sheep which can       
 survive on the poor land.We also have 
 some shearlings (one year old sheep)  
 which will be added to the flock and  
 about 300 lamb crosses which we have  
 bred this year.Most of these lambs    
 will be sold but we will keep about   
 60 for ourselves.                     
 The sheep are kept for the{wool}and   
 usually graze freely on the moorland. 
 We farm about 15 acres for hay which  
 is used as winter feed and bedding.
