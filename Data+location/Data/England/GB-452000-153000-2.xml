		<title>02Ecology in Hannington</title>
		<content> Hannington is situated in chalk       
 downland, being itself on the claycap 
 of the hilltops. This clay/flint soil 
 was traditionally better farmland. It 
 is at 650 Ft with little tree shelter 
 resulting in lower temperatures &amp; in- 
 creased rainfall. The water is sup-   
 plied by main pipeline from a borehole
 in Kingsclere. There is no main sewer-
 age service, each dwelling having its 
 own cesspit or septic tank. The vil-  
 lage is sited around a central green, 
 (old water supply ponds) from which   
 single tracks,footpaths &amp; bridleways  
 radiate to neighbouring villages &amp;    
 farms intersecting others on the way. 
 The land is mainly arable, there re-  
 mains some paddocks around village    
 houses for horses. Pature land for    
 cattle &amp; sheep. Many of the houses    
 have large productive vegetable plots.
 The annual average rainfall is 80 cm. </content>
