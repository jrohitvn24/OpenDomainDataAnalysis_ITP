		<content> Mr and Mrs Keele have to cut down the 
 coarse grass and plants annually so   
 that the other rare plants can grow.  
 They do this work in the autumn and   
 winter with the help of local         
 conservationists.                     
 Mrs Keele thinks that the reserve is  
 called Lolly Moor because it is       
 low-lying moorland (low-lie = lolly). 
 Lolly Moor Nature Reserve is open to  
 the public and it is one of several   
 sites controlled by the Norfolk       
 Naturalists Trust who are fighting to 
 maintain the natural fauna and        
 wildlife of the region.               
 To encourage young people to take an  
 interest in conservation the          
 mid-Norfolk branch of the Naturalists 
 Trust has formed a local branch of    
 Watch which also helps to look after  
 the reserve.
