		<content> The agriculture in this area is mainly
 arable . The crops that are grown are 
 sugarbeet,wheat,barley,peas,beans,and 
 potatoes.There is some grazing land   
 around Reepham,where cows are kept for
 milk and for beef.Modern farming is   
 used for some crops.Special harvesters
 ,drills,elevators and riddlers are    
 used for potatoes and sugarbeet. Big  
 Tractors up to 345 horsepower are used
 with ten furrow ploughs.Most of the   
 fields which are used for arable      
 farming are very large and the hedges 
 have been taken out.The fields which  
 are used for grazing are much smaller 
 and still have hedges.There is a fish 
 farm,next to the river,where you can  
 go fishing or go and buy fish. There  
 is some wasteland near Whitwell Hall. 
 There is a grain store and a place    
 where farm machinery is sold and      
 repaired.                             </content>
