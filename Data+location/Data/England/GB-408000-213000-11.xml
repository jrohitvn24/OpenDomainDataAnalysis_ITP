		<content> Compared to other small towns and     
 villages, Northleach receives very    
 little publicity. Just recently it has
 featured more because of the proposed 
 closing of the excellent school. There
 were three reports and one death in a 
 week's papers  in july 1985 of the    
 Gloucestershire echo.                 
 1. There was a complaint about the    
 plan to close Westwoods Grammar       
 School, written by a concerned parent.
 2. Traction engines, Road Rollers and 
 motor cars eg. Triumph Southern Tourer
 were among the collection gathered for
 the 11th Northleach Steam Fair held   
 for charity.                          
 3. The Cotswold Countryside Collection
 set up in 1981 in Northleach received 
 one of 16 certificates of distinction 
 for being one of the best national    
 tourist attractions of 1984.
