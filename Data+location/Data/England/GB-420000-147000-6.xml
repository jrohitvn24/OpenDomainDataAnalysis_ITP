		<title>06HOUSING IN TIDWORTH</title>
		<content>  The majority of housing in Tidworth  
 is brick built and Ministry of Defence
 property. There is a large council    
 estate at Pennings Road and a small   
 estate between Ludgershall Road and   
 Kennet Road,mainly occupied by retired
 people. The oldest Tidworth property  
 is a 400 year old detached,flintstone 
 built,thatched cottage. The first Army
 houses were built in 1903 but the     
 majority were built in the 1960's.    
 Married soldiers live mainly on the   
 Matthew or Zouch Estates in the North 
 of the village. The Officers' houses  
 are in South Tidworth. Gardens tend to
 be small but there are large areas of 
 open public space. Single soldiers    
 live in the Barracks which were built 
 at the beginning of the century. These
 are very overcrowded and are in the   
 process of being replaced during a    
 rebuilding programme.                 </content>
