		<content> There are no shops in the village     
 although some of the inhabitants do   
 offer fresh garden produce for sale   
 from the "garden gate" and mobile     
 grocery, butcher, baker, fish and     
 fruit and vegetable vans visit each   
 week. Likewise, there is a normal     
 delivery and collection of mail, a    
 morning delivery of newspapers and the
 milkman calls five days a week.       
                                       
 The major employer of the area exclud-
 ing farm and agricultural workers is  
 that of Nelson Green and Son who      
 specialize in agricultural machinery  
 and operate from a large complex in   
 the centre of the village.
