		<title>19PEOPLE &amp; FARMING-W.WRATTING</title>
		<content>     The major land use in the whole of
 the survey area is arable farming, but
 modern methods mean that very few     
 people are employed in farming. Old   
 tied cottages have been sold or let in
 many cases. Not much activity can be  
 seen in the fields except at harvest  
 time.                                 
     The farming has an important      
 influence on the environment in which 
 the local people live. There is very  
 little common land or accessible wood-
 land and many footpaths are ploughed  
 over particularly where hedges have   
 been removed to increase field size.  
 This means that there is not much     
 access for adults or children to      
 the land that lies around their homes.
 Spraying of herbicides and fertilisers
 and stubble burning are all acticities
 which can have unpleasant effects on  
 the village population.               </content>
