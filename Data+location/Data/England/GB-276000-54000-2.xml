 There are a number of small streams as
 well as the{River Harbourne}in the    
 area.  These all contribute to the    
 waters of the{River Dart,}which has   
 its main source on Dartmoor.  There is
 now a bridge over the Harbourne but   
 the village grew up around the fording
 place, hence the name,{Harbertonford.}
 The ford is maintained as a pleasant  
 feature of the village, though it is  
 no longer used.                       
                                       
 The only major road through the area  
 is the Totnes to Kingsbridge road.    
 All the other roads are single track  
{lanes.} There are quite a few places  
 where the roads are wide enough for   
 two vehicles to pass comfortably.
