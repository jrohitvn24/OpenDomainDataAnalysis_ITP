<title>21Pagham Harbour Snail</title>
<content>

In 2007 a rare Defolins Lagoon snail was discovered at Pagham Harbour.  It has only been found at 3 places in Britain.  It is only 2mm long. 40 snails were discovered, but only 3 or 4 were alive. It likes to live in brackish water, gently percolating through shingle, and does not like much disturbance. Rigid environmental legislation from Europe puts the welfare of the snail above the welfare of local residents whose homes, businesses and local infrastructure at Pagham, are at risk of flooding, and people are worried that necessary sea defences may be stopped, or made too expensive by the requirements to protect it within a 1 km buffer zone.  &lt;br />&lt;br />Strangely the snail was not found near the lagoon, but somewhere on the shingle bank above the high water mark on Church Norton Spit though the experts cannot agree on exactly where it was found.  It has been the talk of the village throughout 2011.   &lt;br />
