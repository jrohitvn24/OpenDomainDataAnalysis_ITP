		<title>14CHANGES IN GOLANT &amp; LERRYN</title>
		<content>      The greatest change in{Golant    
 happened in 1965 when the station     
 was closed.  Now only  goods trains   
 use the line which goes to{Fowey.     
      An elderly resident of{Golant    
 recalled how when the railway line was
 open, a favourite day out was to go on
 the train to{Lostwithiel,}then to{Par,
 then to{Fowey}and then return to{     
{Golant.                               
      The school in{Golant}closed soon 
 after the{Second World War. }The few  
 children in the village are taken by  
 bus each day to schools in{Tywardreath
 and{Fowey.                            
     Twenty years ago there were       
 several{shops}in{Lerryn,}now there is 
 only one{Post Office and general      
{store. }Many of the houses in{Lerryn  
 have become{holiday homes.
