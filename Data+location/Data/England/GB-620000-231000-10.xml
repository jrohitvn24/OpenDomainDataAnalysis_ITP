		<title>10LOCAL HEROES</title>
		<content> Most of our heroes are connected with 
 the sea, and in{All Saint's}Churchyard
 are 2 examples worthy of{biography.   
 The first are the graves of two men   
 who gave their lives when the S.S.    
 Berlin sank in 1907. The chief steward
{William Moor}was asked to take care of
 a boy of 5, and rather than save      
 himself he gave his life, and was     
 still holding the boy in his arms when
 his body was recovered. At the rear of
 the churchyard is the memorial to     
{Capt.Fryatt}who was arrested by the   
 Germans after trying to ram a U-boat. 
 Although not a member of the armed    
 forces he was shot in 1916. After the 
 war his body was returned, and        
{Mayflower School}log book tells how   
 the children of the town lined the    
 streets as his coffin was taken to the
 church for burial, having firstly been
 taken to{St.Paul's in London.         </content>
