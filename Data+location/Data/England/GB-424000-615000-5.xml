		<content>    The educational needs of the       
 school-aged children in our block are 
 served by Longhoughton Church of      
 England(Controlled)School.The school  
 accomodates children up to and        
 including the age of nine,and has a   
 roll of approximately 200.Most of the 
 children are from R.A.F.families,often
 remaining for only one year.The large 
 number of these children,however,     
 enables the Educuation Authority to   
 keep the school open.The small number 
 of local children from outlying farms 
 and villages are transported to       
 Longhoughton by taxi.                 
    Older children attend Lindisfarne  
 Middle School, and The Duchess High   
 School,situated in Alnwick,seven miles
 away.                                 
   A playgroup and a nursery are       
 financed by the R.A.F.There is a small
 fee charged per child per day.        </content>
