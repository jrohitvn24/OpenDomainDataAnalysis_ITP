		<content>      Himbleton C.E. First School is   
 set in a small village  and is the    
 provided school for a number of       
 hamlets. Few modern houses have been  
 built and the village retains its     
 rural quality.                        
      The school was built by the      
 church in 1873. The original building 
 is still in use but has been modified 
 over the years. A temporary classroom 
 has been added on a site adjacent to  
 the main building.                    
      Provision is made for between 40 
 and 50 pupils and the school is       
 generally well-attended. Although the 
 school was originally intended for    
 children of agricultural workers,     
 today these pupils are in a minority, 
 since a large proportion of to-day's  
 villagers work outside the area.      
      Parents are supportive and show  
 keen interest in their childrens' work</content>
