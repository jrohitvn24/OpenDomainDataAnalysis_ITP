		<content> 1853 saw the building of Ditton Church
 School with an enlargement in 1887 by 
 the Brassey family for Queen          
 Victoria's Jubilee. In 1983 the       
 building was handed over to Rochester 
 Diocese. (Due to a fall in the birth  
 rate the new school buildings could   
 accommodate all pupils). The Diocese  
 let the building to Ditton P.C.C. at a
 peppercorn rent for an unstated period
 and planning permission was obtained  
 for its conversion to a Church Centre 
 to replace that in Bell Lane. Under   
 the supervision of Alan Hall and the  
 Youth Training Scheme the conversion  
 resulted in a lounge, kitchen and     
 hall. The official opening by Maureen 
 and Alan Hall was on 1st July 1984 and
 since that time the Centre has been   
 used by various Youth and Church      
 organisations.
