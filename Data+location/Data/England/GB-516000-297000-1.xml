		<content>  Peterborough is one of the few places
 in Britain which has been occupied by 
 man throughout human history.         
                                       
  In 1985, as this section is written, 
 the city is just coming to the end of 
 a period of expansion which has       
 changed it from a quiet city on the   
 edge of the Fens into a thriving New  
 Town with a youthful population       
 enjoying beautiful surroundings.      
                                       
  The heart of the city has been       
 transformed from a declining market   
 town into a paved, traffic-free       
 shopping area with a distinctly       
 continental flavour and with the      
 modern Queensgate shopping precinct at
 its centre. Yet at its heart stands   
 the timeless Norman Cathedral watching
 over the changing fortunes of man's   
 brief lives.                          </content>
