		<content> The River Test meanders in a labyrinth
 of waterways - many man-made - in the 
 E of this block, while to the W the   
 downs rise sharply, in some places    
 showing the underlying chalk, quarried
 mainly for land-fill; there is a good 
 proportion of deciduous trees; the    
 chalk turns to clay further E where   
 it is used for brick-making at        
 Michelmersh.  There are approx. 18.25 
 km of public footpaths, none of which 
 now have any practical uses for       
 communication, but their recreational 
 value should not be underestimated.   
 Responsibility for maintenance lies   
 with the Hampshire County Council;    
 most landowners are sympathetic to the
 preservation of footpaths.  Constant  
 pressure by interested bodies is      
 necessary to ensure the continued     
 existence of the footpath network.
