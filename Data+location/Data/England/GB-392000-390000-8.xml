		<content> "Life to me at Harrytown High School  
 is an adaptation of life at home.It   
 has all the joy,sorrow and chaos of   
 any home but among this lies the      
 ambiguous,logarithmically accelerating
 life that we all have to cope with.The
 speed is just incredible.The staff    
 expect the pupil to be able to change 
 from German to English in just five   
 minutes and also to recall all of the 
 relevant information as soon as the   
 classroom door opens.When the final   
 bell sounds at the end of the day a   
 feeling of relief is felt knowing that
 from now on the day can be spent doing
 what I like most-nothing!"            
   Bredbury Comprehensive(1600 pupils)

 each other across Harrytown           
 Lane,Bredbury.
