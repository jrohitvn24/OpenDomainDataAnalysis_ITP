 Mrs. Weir is the owner of the         
 nurseriesand has had the business now 
 for 9 years.  She does most of the    
 work herself, but occasionally has    
 someone help her with a spot of       
 digging.  Her sales are local and she 
 advertises in local shops. The most   
 popular items are bedding plants which
 are bought in.                        
{THE ANVIL GALLERY                     
 This shop has been in Cartmel for 25  
 years.  The name comes from the       
 adjacent shop which used to be a      
 smithy.  Landscape watercolours are   
 the best selling items.
