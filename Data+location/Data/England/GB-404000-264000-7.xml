		<content>{St. Peter's Church Ipsley}is on a hill
 to the east of Arrow valley in        
 Redditch. St. Peters church is an     
 ancient church. We believe there was a
 church in Anglo-Saxon times because   
{Domesday Book}mentions a priest .The  
 present church was built in the{14th  
{Century in the Decorated style.}It is 
 made of red sandstone.It has a western
 tower with small turrets.The entrance 
 is on the southern side. The double   
 doors are made of oak studded with    
 iron.Inside there is a nave and       
 chancel.The side aisles have been     
 blocked up.To the north of the altar  
 are alabaster slabs with effigies of  
 the{Hubaud family of Ipsley Court}Near
 the chancel arch is a rare septagonal 
 14th Century font. Other features     
 include a lectern with a brass eagle  
 and a Jacobean pulpit. Contact the    
 Rector at nearby Ipsley Rectory.      </content>
