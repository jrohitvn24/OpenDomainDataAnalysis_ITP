		<title>07OCCUPATIONS IN EGERTON</title>
		<content>   Egerton was primarily a rural       
 community until the 1800's, when it   
 became a cotton centre with several   
 mills. The mills have closed, their   
 buildings are used for diverse small  
 industries, which provide a few local 
 jobs. The farms are mostly family     
 concerns, with few employees.         
   The majority of residents, 80%, work
 outside the area, with 42% working in 
 Bolton, 38% further afield. The       
 majority are employed in professional,
 managerial or non-manual occupations. 
 Unemployment is considerably below the
 area and national levels. In 60% of   
 families both husband and wife work.  
 17% of the adult population are       
 retired.                              
   14% of adults have worked at some   
 time in the local textile industry.
