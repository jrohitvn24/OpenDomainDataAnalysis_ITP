		<title>07Blandford - School Sports</title>
		<content> Yesterday was Wednesday an exciting   
 day in Blandford because at Archbishop
 Wake First School it was Sports Day.  
 My friend &amp; I saw a man put up the    
 flags for the start &amp; finish. We race 
 lots of children &amp; most of the little 
 ones either fall over or lose plim-   
 soles all over the track.I ran in bare
 feet and I came first.I got a ticket.I
 had never ever won.I was surprised and
 puffed out.There were a lot of parents
 cheering us on.In the monkey race you 
 run on your hands &amp; feet.My best bit  
 was when the'bang'of the gun didn't go
 off &amp; Mrs Darke had to use the whistle
 instead! At last it was time for our  
 inter-class relay.We started with 3   
 Eastenders &amp; 4 Westenders &amp; finished  
 up all the opposite places.Shanena's  
 Mum fell over in the Mums race.There  
 were hot &amp; tired people everywhere but
 it was very exciting.{Class 5L.       </content>
