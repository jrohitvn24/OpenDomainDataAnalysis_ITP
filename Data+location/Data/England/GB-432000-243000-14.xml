		<title>14HOUSING IN TYSOE</title>
		<content> There are 351 residential buildings   
 in the area under review, of which 27 
 belong to 3 local landowners and are  
 either rented out or occupied by      
 present or retired staff. There are   
 104 properties belonging to Stratford 
 on Avon District Council, and 1 owned 
 by a charitable trust; the majority   
 are owner occupied. Building materials
 used are Hornton stone and brick, in  
 almost equal proportions, with no more
 than 4% reconstituted stone. In the   
 Structure Plan for Warwickshire, Tysoe
 is not scheduled for further          
 residential development except in     
 exceptional circumstances to meet     
 local needs, e.g. the conversion of a 
 listed barn or housing for            
 agricultural workers or the clergy.
