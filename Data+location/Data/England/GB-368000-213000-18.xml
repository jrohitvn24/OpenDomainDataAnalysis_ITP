		<content> My Mum has been given the Domesday    
 Project to do by our acting Head-     
 mistress. One night after school, Mum 
 came to collect the computer because  
 we did not have one of our own. With  
 it we got the tape recorder and the   
 screen. We took it home that week     
 because it was half term and nobody   
 was using it. On Sunday Mum realised  
 that she had forgotten to ask for an  
 Ordnance Survey map. I was allowed to 
 help my Mum a bit but I was not       
 allowed to interfere. Mum had to put  
 the information in about our school   
 like: telephone number, address and   
 post code. After that she stopped     
 because it kept saying stop the tape  
 recorder when it was on. So we waited 
 till my Dad came home and we told him.
 But he didn't know any more than I did
 so we switched it off and left it till
 Monday when everybody had a day off.  </content>
