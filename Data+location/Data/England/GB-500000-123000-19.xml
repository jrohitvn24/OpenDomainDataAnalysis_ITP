		<title>19SOCIAL CONCERNS, PETWORTH NE</title>
		<content> It is hardly surprising that in this  
 fresh-air, pollution-free atmosphere, 
 with outdoor occupations, the people  
 are very healthy. If anyone does need 
 the health services, where they go    
 depends on which part of the area they
 live in. Some go to Petworth for a    
 doctor, and at Kirdford a visiting    
 doctor is available every Wednesday.  
 All casualties go to St. Richards     
 Hospital, Chichester. Medical         
 treatment is given as part of the     
 National Health Service, either       
 free or at charges laid dowm by       
 Statute, in the National Health Act.  
 Dentists are at Midhurst or Petworth.
