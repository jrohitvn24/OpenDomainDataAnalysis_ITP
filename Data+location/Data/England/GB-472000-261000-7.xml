		<content>ALONG THE HARBOROUGH ROAD IS A THRIVING
COMMERCIAL SECTION WITH MANY OF THE    
SHOPS NEWLY RENOVATED. THERE IS A WIDE 
VARIETY OF BUSINESS GIVING LOCAL       
RESIDENTS A VERY GOOD SERVICE.THE ROAD 
IS EXTREMELY BUSY WITH BOTH LOCAL AND  
THROUGH TRAFFIC.ACROSS THE ROAD AT THE 
JUNCTION WITH WELFORD RD.IS A NEWLY    
LAID OUT COMPLEX OF SHOPS AND CAR PARK 
MAKING A VERY CONVENIENT PLACE TO SHOP 
FOR THE WEEKS GROCERIES. BEHIND THIS   
DEVELOPMENT LIES THE END OF HIGH STREET
WHERE THE VILLAGE ATMOSPHERE IS MAIN-  
TAINED ALTHOUGH THE NEW BUILDINGS IN   
THE CLOSE RATHER SPOIL THIS DESPITE THE
FACT THAT THEY ARE NICE HOUSES IN THEM-
SELVES. TO THE WEST OF HARBOROUGH ROAD 
LIES KINGSTHORPE RECREATION GROUND MUCH
USED FOR SPORTING ACTIVITIES. A PRIVATE
INDOOR BOWLING CLUB IS BEING BUILT IN  
THE  S.E.CORNER BUT MANY RESIDENTS FEAR
THE MEMBERSHIP FEES WILL BE TOO HIGH.  </content>
