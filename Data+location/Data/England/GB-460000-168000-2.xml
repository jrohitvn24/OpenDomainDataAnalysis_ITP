		<title>02TRAFFIC SURVEY INTRODUCTION</title>
		<content> The most significant feature within   
 this sector is the road network.      
 Between 09:15 and 10:00 on Thursday   
 28th June 1985 30 13 year old pupils  
 from Theale Green School conducted a  
 traffic survey of the roundabout just 
 west of Theale. The technique used was
 to write down the numbers on the      
 number plate of every vehicle entering
 and leaving the roundabout on each of 
 the five roads. Work in the classroom 
 afterwards allowed the pupils to      
 calculate the traffic flow. Despite   
 the fact that the morning rush hour   
 was over, 1,589 vehicles used the     
 roundabout in the 45 minutes during   
 which the survey was being conducted. 
 As will be seen from the following    
 five pages, the traffic flow was      
 largely predictable with the great    
 majority of vehicles using the main   
 east-west routes.                     </content>
