		<title>03HONEY,FENSTANTON</title>
		<content>    {Honey}Hill,the oldest part of     
 Fenstanton was believed once to have  
 a{honey}market on the green.Today in  
 the post office they sell{fresh honey.
    {Mr Hobbs}owns 18 hives.In 1984    
 he got{1/4 ton of honey from 12 hives.
 Most of Mr Hobbs honey is made from  }
 rape.Bees can fill a frame in one day 
 Some work faster than others but they 
 work faster if smoked .The machine is 
 filled with cardboad which creates    
 smoke.In the old days nearly everyone 
 produced their own honey. In winter   
 bees stay in the brude chamber to keep
 warm.The{brude}is the bottom half of  
 the bee hive and the{super}is at the  
 top.All the{workers}are female and in 
 a hive the average amount is 4,0000 to
 6,0000.The{queen bee}lays her own     
 weight of eggs.Sometimes she leaves   
 and she does the workers follow.This  
 is called a{swarm.                    </content>
