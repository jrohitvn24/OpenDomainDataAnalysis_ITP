		<title>13OUR HOLIDAYS</title>
		<content> I like holidays where there are lots  
 of things to do.Last year we went to  
 the Lake District.We stayed in chalets
 in the woods by Lake Windermere.There 
 was a wide choice of activities which 
 included rock climbing and            
 absailing,topper sailing,dinghy       
 sailing and canoeing in Kayaks and    
 Canadians.In the evenings there were  
 talks and crafts to try.I went to a   
 talk about owls.The man who came to   
 talk to us brought a barn owl,a tawny 
 owl,an eagle owl and some others. One 
 evening there was an overnight        
 bivouak. We enjoyed this holiday the  
 most.It is good to get away from home 
 on holiday.                           
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
