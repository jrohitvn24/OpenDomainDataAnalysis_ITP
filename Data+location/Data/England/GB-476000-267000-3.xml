		<title>03The Church in Holcot Village</title>
		<content>   The churchyard is{neglected}since   
 no-one wants to be resposible for its 
 upkeep. The grass has not been cut    
 this year, the gutters are blocked    
 with dead leaves and the stonework is 
{decaying.                             
                                       
   The interior of the church is better
 kept. Local ladies have a rota for    
 cleaning and flower arranging.        
                                       
   The pews are polished and fresh     
 flowers are arranged in vases but the 
 carpets are becoming very{faded.}     
                                       
   The ancient{wall paintings}on the   
 north wall are no longer recognisable.
 On the west wall a few heads are still
 visible as is a small pattern on the  
 window splay at the west end.
