tone is in Sandgate Road and Guildhall

the town centre, while Presto is on the
outskirts of Folkestone. Other shops   
include clothing, shoes, toy and gift  
shops. The Old High Street is a steep  
cobbled road and is popular with       
tourists as it has plenty of souvenir  
shops. One of the main attractions is  
the rock shop where people can watch   
the rock being made. The people who    
shop in Folkestone are mainly local, or
people from the surrounding rural areas
who come to buy clothes and food.      
Tourists are also important customers, 
especially in Summer. Visitors from
