		<title>01OUR SURVEY AREA</title>
		<content> Our block is in North_east Essex      
 sometimes called the Tendring         
 Peninsula about 3 miles from the      
 coast. The nearest town is Clacton_   
 on_Sea.                               
 Half of Little Clacton village and a  
 little of Thorpe_le_Soken come into   
 our area,otherwise it is mainly farm_ 
 land with one or two small woods.     
 A large part of the housing is mainly 
 two bedroomed bungalows and being     
 close to the sea, more than 32% of it 
 is occupied by retired people.        
 At Thorpe Cross we have some large    
 gravel workings but apart from        
 farming, the only industry is the     
 Maltings by Thorpe Station employing  
 five people. Because of this, people  
 have to travel either to Clacton or   
 Colchester to work. Quite a large     
 number also commute to London each    
 day.                                  </content>
