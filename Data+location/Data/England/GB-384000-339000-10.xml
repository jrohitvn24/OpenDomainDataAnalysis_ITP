		<title>10Trentham Garden's Future</title>
		<content>The swimming pool will probably never  
be used again.This is because the old  
swimming pool would cost 1/4 of a      
million pounds to be renewed.Also it is
now not in the Trentham Gardens plan.  
But they are thinking of building      
another one nearer.Today Trentham      
Gardens operates 500 acres.Part of the 
estate is covered by a mile long lake. 
The pleasure and leisure part of       
Trentham Gardens,(including the Italian
Gardens) has been opened since about   
1911.The fair has been opened for at   
least 15 years.Concerts are held about 
3 or 4 times a year.The water skiing is
for Stoke Water skiing club.
