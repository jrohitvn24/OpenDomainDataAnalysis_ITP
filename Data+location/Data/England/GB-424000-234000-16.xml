		<title>16Farming in the Wolfords</title>
		<content> This block is nearly all farmland on  
 good but heavy soil. There are several
 milking herds, beef cattle a flock of 
 sheep and two pig units. Poultry are  
 only kept on a domestic scale. The    
 main arable crops are barley and wheat
 with a small acreage this year of oil 
 seed rape and oats. Two farmers grow  
 potatoes. A small amount of Maize was 
 grown as a 'pick your own' crop. Kale 
 was grown as a fodder crop for cattle 
 and also a few acres of feed peas.    
 Grass is fairly intensively cultivated
 both for grazing and for winter keep -
 the cattle live on silage and hay when
 they are in for the winter. The sheep 
 are kept out but given extra hay and  
 concentrates. They are lambed inside  
 in March and April. There is one large
 farm employing 9 men, the other farms 
 are mainly run by the families.
