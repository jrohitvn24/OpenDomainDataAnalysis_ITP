		<content> The centre of population is           
 Longborough village mentioned in the  
 original Domesday as Longborge.There  
 are approx. 200 properties built      
 mainly of local Cotswold stone;       
 disused quarries litter the locality.A
 small percentage of homes-5% are built
 of brick &amp; 20% of Bradstone,          
 artificial Cotswold stone blocks.In   
 Donnington &amp; outlying areas Cotswold  
 stone is almost entirely used for     
 building.                             
 Of the 200 proprties in Longborough 24
 are originally Council houses, 10 are 
 owned by Manor Farm, Upper Town Farm, 
 Donnington's Brewery &amp; the Church.The 
 majority are owner-occupier.          
 Several properties are second homes &amp; 
 are used only at weekends &amp; holiday   
 periods.
