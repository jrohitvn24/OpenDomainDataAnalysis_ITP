		<title>05VILLAGE OF MARSTON MEYSEY</title>
		<content>  A{Wiltshire}village either side of a 
 through road, "The Street", surrounded
 by cereal producing farmland, pasture 
 for cattle and horses, and an         
 airfield. The sixty houses range from 
 large country houses ("The Manor" and 
 "The Grange") to {Cotswold}style      
 cottages, and include twelve council  
 houses, four old people's bungalows,  
 some infilling houses of reconstituted
{Cotswold}stone, and, increasingly,    
 conversions of barns/stables to       
 dwelling houses.                      
  There is a church, a former school   
 used as a village hall, an inn ("The  
 Spotted Cow and Calf") and a garage   
 doing repair work, but there is no    
 shop - the Post Office/General store  
 having shut down upon the death of the
 owner. Private transport is essential 
 as there is limited public transport.
