		<content>Peter Wheldons orchard started up about
50 years ago in 1930.It has grown up   
over the years and now has 360 acres of
land.It is run by Peter Wheldon and his
two sons.Up to 100 people are          
permanently employed there.People age  
10-15 are employed part time to pick   
left over blackcurrants.They get paid  
according to how much they             
collect.There are a large variety of   
fruit trees which grow 47 kinds of     
apples.They also have bush-fruits such 
as rasberries,goosberries and          
currants.People can pick their own     
fruit if they prefer or buy it ready   
packed.The ground is irrigated by a    
series of underground pipes which get  
water from bore-holes approximately    
260 feet deep.There is also a manmade  
reservoir for when water demand is     
high.
