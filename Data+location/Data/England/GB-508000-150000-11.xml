		<title>11E.Horsley S. College.</title>
		<content> Horsley Towers is now an Electricity  
 Staff College, but reference to the   
 manor occurred in the Domesday Book.  
 (It would have been well-known to     
 travellers to Canterbury, owing to its
 proximity to the Pilgrims Way, immed- 
 iately to the South of this area).    
 The impressive flint gatehouse is now 
 a privately-owned residence.  The     
 present house was built in the 1820s  
 and has had a number of owners,       
 inluding the Earls of Lovelace, Mr    
 Tommy Sopwith the aircraft designer   
 and a girls' school.  It was bought by
 the Central Electricity Generating    
 Board in 1939, huts were built in the 
 grounds and used as a staff           
 headquarters during the 1939/45 war.  
 In 1949, the first course began in    
 what is now an enlarged 90-bedroomed  
 training and Conference Centre.
