		<title>14Farming around Oakley</title>
		<content>Oakley has mostly Jacob sheep they have
black faces.The sheep are kept for     
their meat (mutton or lamb )and        
wool.Dairy farming is important in     
Oakley.The cows are milked by machine  
and it is done indoors.While being     
milked the cows have some extra food so
that they give more milk.Milkis some   
times made into butter,cream and       
cheese.The cows are milked twice a day 
in the morning, and in the             
afternoon.Our local farms grow wheat   
barley,rape and  corn. Britain's       
biggest grain crop is barley.Best      
quality barley is used for making beer 
but the bulk of the crop is made into  
animal food,especially for young beef  
cattle.The wheat goes to make flour for
humans.Britain grows just over half of 
the wheat that the country needs.
