		<title>19Mrs. Smalley</title>
		<content> Mrs.Smalley became blind 26 years     
 ago.An inflammation at the back of the
 eyes damaged the optic nerves.        
 Adjusting to blindness was very       
 difficult at first. She spent nearly a
 year in hospital; at first she        
 wouldn't eat because she couldn't see 
 her food; she disliked going out in   
 case she hadn't dressed properly.     
 After a 3 month housewifery           
 course at Bridgenorth, where she met  
 others who were similarly handicapped,
 she was able to return home and resume
 her domestic activities. She rejected 
 outside offers of help and insisted on
 coping herself. Her husband, daughter 
 and son had also to work hard to      
 adjust to the changes. She received   
 her first guide dog, Nesta, 14 years  
 ago. Nesta and Worthy have given her  
 almost as much mobility as a sighted  
 person.                               </content>
