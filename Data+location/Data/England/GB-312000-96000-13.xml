		<content> Gittisham 1985                        
 The last few years have seen many     
 newcomers to the village. People who  
 want to live in the lovely            
 surroundings but who do not appear to 
 accept the villagers way of life.     
   Change is inevitable, but does it   
 have to be so sudden and so drastic ? 
 I cannot help wondering why Gittisham 
 is being made to lose its quiet way of
 life for a more 'modern' image. Why   
 newcomers must have their way         
 immediately and why they can't        
 integrate gradually, and indeed why   
 some want to take over and others show
 no interest at all? Why the Village   
 shop and Post office aren't patronised
  -both these facilities could be      
 forced to close if not supported.     
                                       
 No, for me Gittisham 1985 has lost its
 magic.                                </content>
