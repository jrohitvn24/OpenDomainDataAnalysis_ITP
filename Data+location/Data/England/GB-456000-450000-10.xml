		<content>{ West Park Nusery}was built 20 years  
 ago to provide plants for parks and   
 gardens in York.Altogether there are  
 98 workers,about 5 are gardeners,4    
 work in the offices and the rest are  
 sent on outdoor jobs away from the    
 Nursery.                              
  In Micklegate the{shops}employ people
 and get lots of customers;many of the 
 people go to see Micklegate Bar and   
 buy souvenirs and presents.Many of the
 people who live in our block depend   
 upon the tourist trade in some way for
 their jobs.                           
  A{taxi}is a car that takes people    
 from place to place for money:a car is
 a vehicle with 5 wheels including the 
 spare wheel.Some cars can do 60 miles 
 on a gallon of petrol but others use a
 lot more.We found that a lot of people
 in our area have jobs that involve    
 driving-like taxi drivers for example.</content>
