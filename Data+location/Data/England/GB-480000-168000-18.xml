		<title>18WOKINGHAM - FARMING</title>
		<content>    The land in the study area is      
 gently undulating and the height      
 ranges from 46_76m. The main soil type
 of the area is London clay.           
    There are 13 farms in the area     
 mainly concentrating on arable crops  
 such as wheat and barley.Some of the  
 land is also used for hay or as ley   
 pasture which is sometimes grazed by  
 horses. However there are one or two  
 farms specialising in poultry _ mainly
 factory farming, and dairying _ with  
 a small amount of farm gate sales _   
 free range eggs, for example. Other   
 crops grown in smaller quantities are 
 peas and potatoes. The average field  
 size is 11 hectares.                  
    Some of the farms have been        
 fragmented by motorways and land on   
 the rural_urban fringe is being lost  
 to residential expansion.
