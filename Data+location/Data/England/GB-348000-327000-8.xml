		<title>08The Wem Brewery  2</title>
		<content>  The water used to come from a well on
 the site but this is only used in an  
 emergency. At present the beer is all 
 real ale and only in the 200 tied pubs
 but a new venture will be to brew     
 and sell a new keg beer to sell in the
 free trade. The old chimney has been  
 knocked down to give space for new keg
 beer equipment. Over 60.000 barrels   
 are brewed per year and each barrell. 
 holds 36 gallons. There are the three 
 kinds of draught beers brewed at Wem. 
 XXX is the cheapest. It is a dark     
 mild. Pale ale is a bit more expensive
 and a bit stronger. Wem Best Bitter is
 the dearest, strongest,and  most      
 popular. All of the pubs are within a 
 radius of 60 miles.The main trading   
 areas  are north into Staffordshire,  
 east into Wolvehamton, south into     
 Herefordshire and west to Newtown. The
 most beer is sold in the Telford area.</content>
