		<content> On a{sunny}summer day, there can be   
 few more{pleasant}places to live in   
 than Hexhamshire. However, it is not  
 always like that.According to our     
 local weather expert, the{average     
{annual rainfall}for the area is       
{829.1mm}. In recent years, the lowest 
 annual rainfall was in 1982 -744mm-and
 the highest in 1984 - 892.4mm.In      
 November 1984, 64.1mm fell in 2 days! 
 The{prevailing wind}is from the west, 
 and it can be very strong indeed. You 
 can tell this from the shape of the   
 trees! In winter it can cause huge    
{snowdrifts}, which even with modern   
 snow clearing machines, can take      
 several days to clear. Some people    
 come to school by tractor then! If we 
 look in the school log book, we find  
 that most years some people are cut   
 off. In 1985, however,there was some  
 snow but no drifting.                 </content>
