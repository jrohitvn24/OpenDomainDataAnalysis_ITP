		<title>07MOAT HOUSE FARM</title>
		<content> The old moat{farm,Stapleton}stands    
 raised on a plinth of stone some      
 fifteen to twenty feet above the level
 of the surrounding fields.The moat    
 which no doubt at one time was filled 
 with water to a level half way up the 
 plinth,has long since dried up and an 
 untended orchard has taken its place  
 on two sides.The ground is boggy and  
 spongy to the N.W except where an old 
 brick bridge has fallen in and become 
 part of the cart way leading under the
 square opening of the ancient gateway.
 A few years ago a tudor gate-house    
 stood above the masive timbers of the 
 opening.In Domesday times,the lord of 
 the manor lived here,vasals of the    
 Earl Roger de Montgomery,cousin and   
 tenant in capite of King William.There
 is little doubt that the moat farm    
 stands on the original site of a moat 
 the meeting place of saxon elders.    </content>
