		<content> Mr.Vicars owns a corner shop. He has  
 been living in Hemsworth for 48 years,
 although he has only worked in        
 Hemsworth for 2 years.                
 There have been quite a lot of changes
 sinse Mr.Vicars has been living here  
 as a lot of new estates have been     
 built, such as the Scotch Estate and  
 Lowfield Road which used to be Crow   
 Lane.                                 
 Mr. Tolson,the cobbler, started shoe  
 repairing 65 years ago. He has        
 always lived in Hemsworth. On Cross   
 Hills there used to be a school and   
 where G T News is now there used to be
 a water trough.  Mr Tolson agrees with
 Mr. Vicars that there ought to be a   
 Community Centre for elderly people.  
 He also thinks that people should set 
 up their own businesses.
