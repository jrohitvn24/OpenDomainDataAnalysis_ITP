		<title>14BRISTOL WHITELADIES ROAD</title>
		<content>  {Whiteladies Road}is the busy main   
 road leading north from the city to   
 the {Downs}. There is usually a lot of
 traffic,with queues at rush hour and  
 many pedestrians . It starts by the { 
{Victoria Rooms }, which used to be    
 Bristol's main concert hall and goes  
 by lots of offices including the BBC .
 The nearby streets are mainly         
 residential . Then you start to see   
 mainly shops . There is a really good 
 variety and you can buy almost any    
 thing . Near the station is a brand   
 new shopping precinct with a big super
 market . We found most people did much
 of their shopping there but also used 
 smaller shops for things like bread   
 and vegetables . There are several    
 restaurants including Indian , Chinese
 and Greek , and plenty of take away   
 food places .
