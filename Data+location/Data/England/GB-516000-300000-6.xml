		<title>06LOCAL WATCH SCHEME</title>
		<content>   A few weeks ago a policeman came    
 to our house giving us a form asking  
 if we wanted to be part of the Local  
 Watch Scheme. 440 houses were asked   
 and l45 said they were interested.    
 The survey included Crown St. Burmer  
 Rd.Thistlemoor Road &amp; Scotney St.They 
 also asked if we wanted free advice on
 locks and alarms. My "Nan" who lives  
 in Scotney St. said that she did. I   
 was present when they came.           
   They showed us many different locks 
 and alarms.My Nan chose an alarm      
 which you put on the bottom of the    
 door.When you go out you press a lever
 and lock the door as normal. When a   
 burglar comes, if he pushes on the    
 door, then a soft alarm goes off to   
 warn the burglar. Then if he keeps    
 pushing on the door, the alarm gets   
 louder and wakes you up.
