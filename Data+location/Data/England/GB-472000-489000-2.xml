		<title>02Lastingham Village</title>
		<content> All three villages were mentioned in  
 the{Domesday Survey}of 1086. The 3    
 wells in Lastingham are dedicated to  
 St. Cedd,who built the Monastery in   
 654 AD,St. Chad,his brother who became
 Abbot on Cedd's death,&amp; St.Ovin who   
 helped Chad to spread christianity.   
 The unique Norman crypt was built on  
 the old Monastery site by Stephen of  
 Whitby in 1078 to house the remains of
 St.Cedd. This is today the foundation 
 of the present church of St.Marys.    
 Jackson bridge commemorates John      
 Jackson,an 18th Century portrait      
 painter who was born here. Over the   
 past 20 years much renovation of the  
 18th &amp; 19th Century cottages has been 
 done,mostly by people retiring to the 
 village. There is a general store with
 post office,an inn,a licensed         
 restaurant,a small guest house &amp; an   
 hotel.                                </content>
