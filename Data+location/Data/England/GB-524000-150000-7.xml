		<content>   In May, the local newspaper gave    
 coverage to the fortieth anniversary  
 of{V.E.Day}with{reminiscences}of a    
 lady who was eleven in 1945 &amp; also    
 the memories of a former Japanese     
 prisoner of war.                      
   There was unfavourable comment about
 the sudden closure of roads in Reigate
 in order to check the safety of the   
{caves }beneath the town's centre.     
   In the advertising section many     
 pages were devoted to the sale of     
{properties. Prices}asked for 4

 excess of Â£130,000; whereas a 2

 Â£40,000.

 opinions about Donyngs-the{new leisure
{centre}at Redhill. Both the cost-Â£4   
 million-&amp; the architecture were       
 severely criticised.                  </content>
