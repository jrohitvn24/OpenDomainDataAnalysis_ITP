{REDGATES} is situated in the{Exe      
{Valley}and here all aspects of        
 spinning,knitting and weaving are     
 taught. The wool is taken from the    
 fleece, carded and hand spun on the   
 traditional spinning wheels, washed   
 and knitted into jumpers, cardigans   
 and shawls. After spinning, the wool  
 can be woven into material for making 
 skirts, jackets and blankets. If      
 desired the wool can be dyed using    
 natural products - lichen, onion skins
 etc. The craft is taught at the       
 Further Education College, week-end   
 schools are held, demonstrations at   
 shows and as far away as Japan have   
 been given and Redgates hold the world
 record for the completion of a sweater
 - shearing, spinning and knitting to  
 the final product - 1 hour 55 minutes.
