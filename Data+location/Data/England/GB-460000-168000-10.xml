		<title>10THE FISHERY</title>
		<content> During 1985 a possibly unique site    
 was destroyed by gravel extraction.   
 The Fishery lay on the northern bank  
 of the river Kennet and was probably  
 built when work took place on the     
 Kennet Navigation in the 1720's. It   
 consisted of two buildings surrounded 
 by a rectangular ditch which enclosed 
 about 1 acre. The southern ditch      
 formed part of another larger ditch   
 which enclosed about three acres      
 including the 1 acre site. This was   
 not a medieval moated site, but was   
 part of a network of withy beds. The  
 smaller of the buildings was probably 
 a boiler house which was needed in the
 production of withies for commercial  
 purposes. The larger building was     
 where the site worker lived. In the   
 1850's he described himself as a      
 fisherman. Until the 1939-45 war there
 were eel-traps in the ditches.        </content>
