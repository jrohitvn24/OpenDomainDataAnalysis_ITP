		<content> Coming into town on the A149,S&amp;M is   
 the next firm after Marricks and      
 Cranes.they started up in             
 1976,supplying firms in norfolk with  
 timber building materials-9 people    
 work there. (It is near the junction  
 of the A149 and the B1145(Greens      
 Road)).This is the residential part   
 now,including Suffield close,         
 Kingsway, and if you go on towards the
 town under a railway bridge Bradfield 
 road is off to your left.Most of the  
 houses were built in the 1930's-the   
 bungalows were built in the 1960's.   
 Bradfield Road has an OfLicense/shop. 
 The road goes to the edge of town then
 Antingham,Bradfield and Lyngate.You go
 over the railway line and on the left 
 is the back of Crane Fruehauf,in front
 you can see an enormous scrap yard.The
 next right will get you to the        
 Industrial Estate North on the bypass.</content>
