		<title>05A JOB SURVEY</title>
		<content> I have found out the jobs that the    
 mums and dads from the families in our
 school do. More people have jobs in   
 the town than in the country. Only a  
 few work locally. The local jobs are  
 fruit farming. They are seasonal jobs 
 that mums do such as strawberry, hop &amp;
 apple picking &amp; potato collecting. For
 the rest of the year they are         
 unemployed. Most people's dads work   
 away from the village- in the nearest 
 large town on light  industry such as 
 steel packing or gas delivering. Some 
 have professional jobs as a college   
 teacher, librarian, youth trainer &amp;   
 two teachers. A few work for large    
 firms as carpenter, caretaker &amp;       
 groundsman. Our most  famous father is
 an entertainer who works an emu puppet
 and is known all over the world. It   
 seems funny seeing someone on T.V.    
 wandering across the playground.      </content>
