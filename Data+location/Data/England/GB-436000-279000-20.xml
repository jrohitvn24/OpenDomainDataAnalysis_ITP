		<title>20CARNIVAL DAY</title>
		<content> Each year in Coventry we have a       
 carnival in June.It is a time of fun.A
 procession of decorated lorries leaves
 the Memorial Park and makes its way   
 through the city centre.Big crowds    
 line the route.On the backs of the    
 lorries are men and women dressed in  
 funny clothes-I saw a man dressed up  
 as a baby.Often a band on a lorry will
 play throughout the afternoon.Other   
 people taking part will walk alongside
 the lorries collecting money from the 
 spectators,the proceeds going to      
 various charitable organisations.
