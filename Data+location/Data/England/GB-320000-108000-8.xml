		<content> 1  A glance at the O.S.map shows that 
 the area is thinly populated,though   
 some of the farms may be a cluster of 
 dwellings,sheltering more than one    
 household.About half the inhabitants  
 are local people,whose families have  
 been in this district for several     
 generations,though not necessarily at 
 the same farm.During the last twenty  
 years there has been a steady influx  
 of middle-class people from the towns.
 Many of these are retired couples;    
 but luckily the village still boasts  
 its school,so that young families do  
 still settle in the valley.Good road  
 connections with the neighbouring     
 towns make it possible for a young    
 professional to live in rural peace   
 and commute to work by car.
