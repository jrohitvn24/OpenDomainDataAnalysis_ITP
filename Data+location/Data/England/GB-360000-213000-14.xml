		<content> Lydbrook-changes in employment.       
 Although a rural area few people are  
 employed on farms or by the Forestry  
 Commission.Many local people were     
 employed by Rank Xerox at Mitcheldean 
 but there have been drastic           
 redundancies.There are four main      
 employers in the Lydbrook valley.     
 "Lydwood",a small factory employing 18
 people,mostly local,making sports     
 shields,trophies and furniture.       
 "Rothdean"a haulage company with 24   
 employees-all local except one.       
 "Reeds"-a paper making factory        
 employing 450 people,a third of whom  
 are from Lydbrook area.Several fathers
 of Joys Green School children work at

 annual Christmas parties.A new haulage
 company,Lyndsley Morgan"has just      
 opened in Lydbrook.High percentage
