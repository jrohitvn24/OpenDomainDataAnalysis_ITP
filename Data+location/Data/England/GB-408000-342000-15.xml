		<title>15Survey on the village shop 2</title>
		<content>We continued to question the customers 
as they entered the village shop.      
 The next question asked was:          
"Do you think a village shop is        
important?"                            
 Everybody said "Yes" and five people  
said "Very important"                  
 When asked "Why?" people answered that
they thought the shop was important    
for:                                   
 a)Old people                          
 b)Handy when you had run out of       
anything                               
 c)Meeting other people                
 The next question was if people       
thought the prices in the shop were    
right:                                 
 Most people thought they were perhaps 
a little on the high side.             
 It seems difficult for a small village
shop to compete with the big town      
supermarkets,but people still need them</content>
