		<title>12Medical Care Around Chard</title>
		<content> There is a Doctor's Practice in{BLOCK 
{12}where three male partners provide  
 medical cover for an area of over{100 
{sq.km.}around the Chard district.     
 Health Visitors specialise in nursing 
 and pre_school child care and well    
 baby clinics are held weekly at the   
 surgery.                              
 Patients requiring specialist         
 attention are usually referred to     
 consultants in {Taunton}and from      
 there,possibly to{Bristol.}           
 The  Chard Clinic is quite distinct   
 from the Surgery and is provided by   
{Somerset Health Authority}primarily to
 house the{School Dental Service.}A    
 dentist shares his time between       
 clinics in Chard and Crewkerne and is 
 responsible for children from}3 to the
 end of full_time education who choose 
 not to have free treatment from a     
 private dental surgeon.               </content>
