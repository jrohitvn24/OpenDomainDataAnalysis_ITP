		<content> Sessay is a village facing{changes    
 likely to alter both its physical     
 appearance and its inhabitants.  Until
 recently people both lived and worked 
 in the village.  Now probably half the
{working occupants}work elsewhere,their
 children are likely to move completely
 to find work, and nowadays both boys  
 and girls may want a{career.} Indeed, 
 the whole village and its way of life 
 has been forced to look outwards. Once
 farmers bought &amp; sold in the county,  
 now they deal with large companies.   
{Grants and subsidies}influence their  
 choice of crop. In a farming community
 there were and are many shared experi-
