 doing most of their weekly shopping   
 there. 63% said the shops did cater   
 for most basic needs bar clothes. 52% 
 stated costs, usually higher than in  
 larger shopping areas were offset by  
 saved time and travel costs.  60%     
 thought perishable goods were less    
 than fresh; choice was limited.  All  
 felt shops needed renovation.

 bare minimum; young mothers avoiding  
 public transport and others purchasing
