		<title>03Troutbeck village</title>
		<content>  Troutbeck village is peculiar in     
 several ways. It has no obvious       
 centre and the church is well away    
 from the main settlement. It is strung
 out along the valley side, the main   
 road by-passing it at the bottom of   
 the valley. In fact, it is not really 
 a village, more a succession of       
 hamlets, with rough grazing and open  
 fell above, and richer meadow below.  
 The oldest, and finest building in the
 village is Townend, the former home of
 the Browne family. Dating from the    
 late 16th century, it is now owned by 
 the National Trust and open to the    
 public. There are many 17th and 18th  
 century buildings which were once     
 farms and of which many have been     
 converted to private use. A recent    
 trend has been the conversion of      
 disused barns in to homes.
