   Mr Simpson's farm buildings are over
 100 years old. They have been handed  
 down through his family since 1879.   
 He has lived there all his life.      
   It is a mixed farm of 300 acres.In  
 the fields he grows potatoes, barley  
 and wheat. All these are sold as cash 
 crops. He also keeps 100 Friesian     
 cows, 70 calves and one Hereford bull.
 He milks his cows twice a day and each
 time it takes two  hours. The yield is
 1500 litres of milk. Every year one   
 cow gives  5000 litres. He has a      
 herring_bone milking parlour. The     
 animals he does not want to keep go to
 Chelford auction.                     
   Mr Simpson gets up at 6am and works 
 a long day.He has three men,a dog,four
 tractors and lots of machinery to help
 him. He enjoys being a farmer.        </content>
