		<title>15Real Ale,The 3 Horseshoes</title>
		<content> The Campaign for Real Ale (C.A.M.R.A.)
 was formed in 1971 to preserve and    
 promote real ale-brewed from malt and 
 hops and served without high pressure 
 gas as fewer than half of Britain's   
 pubs served real ale.                 
 The 3 Horseshoes pub at Kempston West 
 End has been listed in CAMRA's "Good  
 Beer Guide" for the last 12 years and 
 many of its regulars swear it serves  
 the best pint in Bedfordshire! A small
 country pub,only a handful of         
 customers come from the immediate     
 farming area,most come from Bromham,  
 Wootton, Kempston, Cranfield and      
 Bedford.There has been a pub here for 
 over 100 years, originally there were 
 4 buildings and pigs were kept  but   
 today there is only the one building  
 which was stuck by lightning in 1983  
 and the pub was closed for 9 weeks.
