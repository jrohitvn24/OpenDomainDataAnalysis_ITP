		<content> The aea is characterised by gently    
 rolling,rich arable farmland, a       
 patchwork of large irregular shaped   
 fields, bounded by wire fences and    
 occasional hedges.  Now in wintertime,
 most cultivated fields are ploughed   
 earth, with winter wheat newly        
 sprouting here and there. A few cattle
 still graze the pastureland, but most 
 animals are under cover in the farms. 
 The main Leeds to York road cuts      
 across the North west corner, but all 
 other roads, some ancient travel ways,
 are surfaced with rubble and now      
 interconnect scattered farmhouses     
 solidly built from local limestone.   
 About 15 percent of the area in two   
 main patches is mixed, deciduous      
 woodland, and scattered groups of     
 trees occur everywhere. The most      
 notable building, Hazelhurst castle   
 once the home of the Vavaseur family  </content>
