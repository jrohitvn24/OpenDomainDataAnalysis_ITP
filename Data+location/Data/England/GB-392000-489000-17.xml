		<content> During the past few years, tourism has
 increased dramatically, due, to a     
 large extent, to the popularity of the
 James Herriot 'Vet' books and the     
 subsequent television series.         
 Tourists, known locally as 'visitors',
 are catered for by several small,     
 private hotels and public houses, bed 
 and breakfast accommodation and       
 camping and caravan sites. The main   
 attraction is the scenery and the open
 countryside which provides good       
 walking and hiking. Visitors are also 
 interested in aspects of local life   
 and history, including the site of the
 Roman fort above Bainbridge, the      
 stocks on the Green and the renovated 
 water-mill. Most visitors come by     
 private car (including many from      
 Europe, especially the Netherlands),  
 but the number of coaches has         
 increased recently.                   </content>
