		<title>01OVER VIEW OF MATHON.</title>
		<content>   If you look at our area from the    
 Malvern Hills _which are beside our   
 area_,you will see mostly woods and   
 fields.                               
   In Mathon there are no buses,no     
 trains,nosurgery,no district nurse,no 
 policeman,no church hall,not even a   
 Young Farmers Club.But there is a {   
{parish hall}and there was a {post     
{office}until May 1984.                
   Mathon is mostly an arable farming  
 area and has a small population of    
 between 300 and 350 people.           
   The main employments in the area are
{farming,forestry and sand and gravel  
{extraction.}                          
   The population is mainly elderly due
 to it being such a nice quiet area to 
 retire to.                            
   There are two camp sites that       
 temporarily swell the population in   
 the summer months.                    </content>
