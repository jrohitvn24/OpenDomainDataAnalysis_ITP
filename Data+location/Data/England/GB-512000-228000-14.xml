		<title>14PHEASANTS-LITTLE OFFLEY</title>
		<content> The enclosure is enlarged as the      
 chicks get bigger.Pheasants in        
 captivity will badly peck each        
 other,so,when only a few days old the 
 tip of the beak is clipped.At 3 weeks 
 a white 'beak piece'is placed in the  
 nostril of the beak and into the      
 mouth,preventing them from attacking  
 each other.At about 6 weeks they are  
 put into 'release pens',about six to  
 eight feet high,out in the local      
 woods,and it is hoped they will remain
 in that area during the shooting      
 season.                               
 This year's chicks will probably not  
 breed for two years.The loss of chicks
 raised this year is around three      
 percent.                              
 'Fine weather for Ascot,good year for 
 partridge rearing'                    
 Ascot in 1985 was very wet!
