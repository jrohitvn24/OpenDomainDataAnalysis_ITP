		<title>17A popular game at school</title>
		<content> A popular form of recreation at       
 Greatworth School is "Donkey".        
 You need the following equipment to   
 play this game:                       
 A tennis ball and a wall - a friend   
 would be nice                         
 You take the tennis ball in your hand 
 and face the wall,about 2 metres away.
 You throw the ball at the wall and    
 try to jump over the ball as it lands 
 on the playground.Your friend has to  
 catch the ball as it bouncies from the
 playground.                           
 It is then their turn to throw the    
 ball at the wall and you stand behind 
 them waiting to catch it.             
 If you fail to jump the ball you are  
 given a letter from the word Donkey.  
 The person who spells the word Donkey 
 first has lost the game.
