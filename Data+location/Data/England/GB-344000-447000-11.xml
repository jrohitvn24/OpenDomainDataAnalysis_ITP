		<title>11Winmarleigh Village School</title>
		<content> Winmarleigh C.E.School was built at   
 the time of 1870 Education Act.It rep-
 laced a 'Master's School' which eludes
 all attempts to trace it.             
 For the first 80 years the village    
 children received all their education 
 here save for the few who gained free 
 place scholarships at Lancaster Royal 
 or Girl's Grammar Schools.            
 The school is currently in a trough   
 with but 19 pupils on roll (49 twelve 
 years ago).The national declining roll
 is exagerated here as the population  
 is cyclic in nature and a generation  
 ago the same problem was present.     
 There are but 36 or so children under 
 11 in the village and discounting 2 in
 private education,2 in R.C. school and
 the 19 on roll the problem is great.  
 This year saw the staving off of clos-
 ure at the 11th  hour for the 2nd time
 in recent years.                      </content>
