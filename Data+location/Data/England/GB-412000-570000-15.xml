		<content>{"The Railway Line"     }              
          Early this century,when the  
{Darras Hall Estate}was established, a 
 railway line was planned to cater for 
 the new estate. The line opened for   
 passenger traffic to{Darras Hall }    
 station in{1913}with provision for an 
 extension to the western edge of the  
 estate. A line was built to a small   
 coal mine at{Kirkheaton}but when      
 operations there ceased the track was 
 removed.                              
          In 1921{Newcastle}Corporation
 provided a motor bus service to the   
 estate and by 1929 the railway line   
 ceased to operate for passenger       
 traffic.The station building,a wooden 
 construction, is still to be seen in  
 Darras Hall.From 1963-1973 it was used
 as a church until a new United        
 Reformed Church was built nearby.It is
 still in use by playgroups,Brownies.  </content>
