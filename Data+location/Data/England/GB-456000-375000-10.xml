		<title>10Welbeck Estate Lodges</title>
		<content>     On the Welbeck Estate part of the 
 block there are some old stone        
 buildings, all of which are listed.   
 There are three lodges on the estate. 
  The Lion Gate is the 'back entrance' 
 to Welbeck Abbey. The drive was built 
 specifically for the Duke of Portland 
 and Royalty. It was covered in red    
 gravel and every time a carriage went 
 over it the tracks would have to be   
 swept over by workers who were        
 employed to keep it free from leaves. 
    The Lion Gate lodge was built in   
 1884 to house the gate keeper who     
 could be called out night or day to   
 open the gates wearing a top hat and  
 tails.The White Gates lodge was built 
 by another set of gates further up the
 drive. This formed part of a relay    
 system starting with a ringing bell   
 which would be passed to Lion Gates.  
 Also there is Tunnel End Lodge(p.9)   </content>
