		<title>13THE LANCASTER CANAL-USES</title>
		<content>  The canal brings benefit to Lancaster
in many different ways. It is very     
popular for pleasure cruisers, in fact 
there are more boats per mile than on  
any other canal. The canal can also be 
used by dinghies and canoes. There are 
many types of fish in the water, so    
fishing is a very popular activity.    
  The canal supports a lot of wildlife,
with many water birds, and other types 
in the hedgrows. There is always a wide
range of wild flowers along the canal  
bank. There are many interesting items 
along the canal. Just North of the city
is the Lune Aqueduct, built in 1797.   
There are many bridges, built of stone,
some of them with grooves where the    
ropes from horseboats wore them away.  
There are old wharves with iron rings  
to tie up the boats. However there are 
no locks on the main part of the canal,
it was cleverly built to avoid them.   </content>
