{Hamworthy Sub Aqua Club}have been     
 diving to investigate a wreck south of
 the Hook sands.  A shift of sand in   
 January 1984 uncovered timbers which  
 caught on a fisherman's net. He had to
 leave his net and ask divers to cut it
 free.  Divers from the Hamworthy club 
 were asked to uncover the wreck and   
 the{Studland Bay Wreck Trust}was      
 formed by {Poole Maritime Museum}and  
{Hamworthy Sub Aqua Club.              
 The divers have found almost the whole
 side of a ship and her load of Spanish
 pottery called{Isabella Polychrome.   
 It is thought that the ship was built 
 in the{Mediterranean between 1475     
{and 1525. }We do not know if the ship 
 was bound for{Poole}or if it was      
 driven off course by bad weather or if
 it was attacked by the{Studland Bay   
{Pirates.                              </content>
