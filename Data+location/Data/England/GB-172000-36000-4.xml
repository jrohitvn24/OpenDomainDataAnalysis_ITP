		<title>04Local History of Stithians.</title>
		<content> Stithians local history society has   
 been meeting every six weeks for ten  
 years.It has four working members,    
 who aim to publish a booklet every two
 years. The next one  will be on       
 Tregonning Mill. In the 19C there were
 forty mills, powder, corn and paper,  
 along the river Kennall, but only     
 Tregonning mill, a listed building    
 maintained  by the  National Trust    
 remains. Quarrying and mining were    
 important industries now the area is  
 mainly farming. An old Cornish saying 
 claims that wherever there is a hole  
 in the ground you will find a         
 Cornishman at the bottom. Miners from 
 Stithians emigrated all over the      
 world; few people emigrate today. The 
 old Stithians family names are,       
 Dunstan, Gluyas, Knuckey, Martin,     
 Moyle, Odgers, Opie and Thomas.
