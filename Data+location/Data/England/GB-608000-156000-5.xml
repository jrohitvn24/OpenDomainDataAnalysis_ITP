		<content>The ladies of the village hall         
committee were trying to put           
together a history of the village      
hall.There were quite a few houses in  
the area with their own swimming       
pools. A playgroup and a ladies keep   
fit group were held in the village     
hall. A patchwork quilt was being made 
by all the ladies of the village hall  
committee.This would be raffled for    
the fund to maintain and improve the   
hall.There had been a Michaelmas Fair  
in the hall to raise money for the     
disabled.On Easter Monday there was a  
pram race organised by the villagers.  
Pilgrims still used the Pilgrims Way or
North Downs Way.A few years back an    
old lady on horseback had ridden       
through the village following the      
ancient track.There were a lot of      
tourists and hikers still using the    
path.                                  </content>
