		<title>19Unemployment in Wigan</title>
		<content>Unemployment in our block is high. In a
survey we carried out in our school    
results showed that unemployment was as
high as 30%.                           
My dad hasn't got a job but my mum has.
She goes to work at 11 o'clock until   
l o'clock. She works as a dinner lady  
at St. Edward's School. When she comes 
home she washes and hoovers and dusts. 
My dad goes to the shop and makes our  
tea and butters some bread. After our  
tea we go for a game of snooker. Some- 
times I beat him and sometimes he beats
me. Sometimes my dad takes me to my    
Grandad's and Grandma's to see them.
