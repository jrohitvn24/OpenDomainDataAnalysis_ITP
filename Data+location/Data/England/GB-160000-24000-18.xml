		<content> In Porthleven there are two schools,  
 an infant and a junior school on the  
 same site. The junior school opened in
 September 1975 and the infants school 
 in March 1980.                        
    Before this there were two separate
 schools called the Church School and  
 the Board School. The Church School   
 stood next to St Bartholomews, the    
 Parish Church, and is now the         
 Christadelphian Meeting Room.         
    The Board School was used by the   
 infants until their new building was  
 ready. It is now used as a store for  
 nets, boats and crab pots.            
    In 1967 when the Torrey Canyon was 
 wrecked off the Seven Stones Reef the 
 Board school was used by the Royal    
 Hampshire Regiment who came to clear  
 away the oil. The army gave the school
 a shield which we still have.
