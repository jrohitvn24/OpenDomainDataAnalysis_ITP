		<title>10Mrs Neal's Pigeons in School</title>
		<content>  Mrs Neal's hobby is breeding,racing  
 and keeping pigeons. She feeds her    
 pigeons on dried peas,sweet corn and  
 beans. They have water to drink.      
  One of her pigeons is called Sidney. 
 Sidney has won races. Mrs Neal has    
 forty-eight pigeons altogether and    
 keeps them in a pigeon loft. They lay 
 their eggs in February or March. They 
 lay two eggs - the second one the day 
 after the first. Mrs Neal brought some
 of her pigeons for Class 3 of All     
 Saints School Dovercourt to see.      
 Class 3 were told that pigeons can see
 twenty miles in the daytime but only  
 two inches at night. She showed the   
 children how to ring a pigeon's foot  
 and explained how to time a pigeon in 
 a race. This was an exciting lesson as
 part of a project on birds.
