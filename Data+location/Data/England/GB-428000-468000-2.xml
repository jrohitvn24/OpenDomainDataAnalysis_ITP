		<content>  {Quarry Moor}is a piece of derelict  
 land to the south of{Ripon.}It was    
 once a quarry for{Magnesian Limestone.
   The late{Alderman T.F. Spence       
 bequeathed the land to the city with  
 the instruction that it was "to be    
 kept as a children's playground for   
 all time"The city council was not able
 to fulfil this wish and a group of    
 local people set up{the"Quarry Moor   
{Development Association"}with the sole
 purpose of developing the moor in     
 accordance with T.F.Spence's wishes.  
   The ownership of the land has been  
 uncertain for sometime. In 1974,      
 Harrogate Borough Council took over   
 the lease due to local government     
 reorganisation. But the Charity       
 Commissioners, who have been          
 investigating who the rightful owner  
 of the land is, have come out in      
 favour of{Ripon City Council.         </content>
