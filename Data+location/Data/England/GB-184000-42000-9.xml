		<title>09St.Michael Penkevil Church</title>
		<content> The churh was built in 1261 in honour 
 of St. Michael.The first priest was   
 Dominus Willelmus. It has never been a
 wealthy church.At one time the inside 
 of the church was divided up into     
 panels with plaster mouldings and     
 rosettes which made it look as if it  
 was the inside of a house.By 1862 the 
 church needed restoring and this was  
 done by George Edmund Street.It is    
 built of three different kinds of     
 stone,Pentuan, Portland and a local   
 type called Killas which is like slate
 and can be easily split.              
   There are several brasses in the    
 church and the oldest is from 1497.It 
 shows John Trenowyth who died 13.3    
 1497.Admiral Edward Boscawen is buried
 here.
