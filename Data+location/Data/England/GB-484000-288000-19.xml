		<title>19CORBY T.V. VIEWING SURVEY.</title>
		<content>This was Men's Singles Final Day at    
Wimbledon, so it was to be expected    
that world-wide audience would include 
a large proportion of our school       
population. The following day we       
surveyed over half the school and found
that 87% had viewed on Sunday, 45% for 
more than three hours! A symptom of the
age! Pundits, parents and teachers     
frequently bemoan the excessive amount 
of time "glued to the box". It can be  
argued that the increasing selfishness 
and passivity of the young is caused by
habitual viewing; and certainly the    
high juvenile crime rate can be linked 
to T.V. Anti-social behaviour might    
stem from bad examples and unsatisfied 
craving stimulated by advertising and  
fictional lifestyles beyond our reach.
