		<content> In our survey we asked people how     
 often they visit the cinema or go to  
 the theatre to see a live show.Most   
 people had not been to either in the  
 last year.Around 20% said that they   
 occasionally go,often taking a child, 
 but only 4% go regularly.             
 When asked what they did at night when
 they went out,almost 35% said they    
 visit friends,30% go to a public      
 house,15% go out for a meal,10% do    
 other things,while 10% don't go out.  
 On Sunday,they visit friends or       
 relatives,go for a walk or a car ride,
 watch T.V.or simply relax;in that     
 order of preference.                  
    We noted some changes in how people
 enjoy themselves today compared with  
 fifty years ago;but many similarities.
 Dancing,visiting local parks and going
 to the cinema have declined.Eating out
 and sporting activies have increased. </content>
