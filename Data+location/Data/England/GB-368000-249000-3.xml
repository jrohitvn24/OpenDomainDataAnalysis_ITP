		<content> What is of interest here is people's  
 attitudes to living in this part of   
 the country. Some older residents who 
 have spent their lives here regret    
 the changes which they see as caused  
 mainly by the motor car. They look    
 back 50 - 60 years when communities   
 were more self-contained with their   
 own shops, schools, adequate public   
 transport, blacksmiths who would do   
 many repairs, and when social life    
 revolved round the church with its    
 large choirs. Newcomers chose this    
 area  because they want peace and     
 quiet in beautiful surroundings, a    
 large garden, and space to bring up   
 a family. Many families have two cars 
 so those who can drive are mobile and 
 not worried by lack of public         
 transport. Lack of  entertainment is  
 compensated for by television and the 
 numerous societies that exist nearby. </content>
