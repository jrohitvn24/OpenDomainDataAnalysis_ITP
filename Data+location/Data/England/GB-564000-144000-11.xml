		<title>11Cardboard Factory P.Wood.</title>
		<content>Before Fairmile Cardboard Containers   
Ltd. became a factory,the building used
to be a blacksmith's. Horses and carts 
would have entered through what is now 
the factory and would have left through
what is now the Saddle Room Restaurant.
The cardboard is brought by lorry and  
unloaded by a fork lift truck.It is    
then placed on smaller pallets and put 
on the pallet track which then carries 
the cardboard to the guillotine where  
it is cut to size. The cardboard is    
then taken to the cutting and creasing 
machine,and from there to the glueing  
machine which glues the sides of the   
containers.The containers are then     
ready for use. Waste cardboard is put  
into a bailer where it is compressed.  
The firm employs local labour.
