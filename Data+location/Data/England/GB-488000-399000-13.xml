 school day written by a girl whose    
 parents both work.                    
          *****************            
 I usually get up at 7 a.m. and then   
 wake my mam and dad.Then I get washed 
 and dressed.After I have made and     
 eaten my breakfast I pack my school   
 bag, not forgetting my lunchtime      
 sandwiches.At about 8.20 I start      
 walking to school.My mam and dad leave
 for work at 8.30.School starts at 9   
 a.m. and ends at 4 pm.I get home from 
 school about 4.10 and my dad usually  
 comes in 5 minutes after me.I spend my
 time watching T.V. or playing in the  
 garden until my mam gets home at about
 5.45.Then I usually talk to her as she
 fills in forms connected with work.   </content>
