		<content> Mrs Coe has lived in Uffington for the
 past 52 years. When she arrived at    
 Stamford a pony bus met her. The      
 village shop, along the main road, had
 the only telephone in Uffington.      
 Sometimes it took 30 minutes to get a 
 connection. The shop had a great range
 of goods and bread was delivered      
 daily. Villagers got water from a pump
 or stand pipe in the road. The present
 village hall, The Bertie Arms and one 
 house have the only remaining thatched
 roofs.                                
 During the first world war the village
 hall was a tin hut near the Bertie    
 Arms. It was also used for billeting  
 soldiers. Then there were three church
 services a day. Uffington House       
 was accidently burnt down in 1903 but 
 the ballroom still stood and was used 
 as a meeting place. Entertainment was 
 gained through quizzes and concerts.  </content>
