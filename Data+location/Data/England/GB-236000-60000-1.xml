		<title>01LANDSCAPE &amp; REVIEW OF BLOCK</title>
		<content>   The area is cut in half by the River
 Lynher,a tributary of the River Tamar.
 In the locality of Notter Bridge,which
 is the highest point where the tide   
 reaches,the sides of the river valley 
 are very steep.                       
 Most of the block,apart from the two  
 residential areas of Landrake and Hatt
 are farmed.                           
 It is an area of rolling hills which  
 has seen relatively little change over
 the centuries.Many of the farmsteads  
 are small in area,family run dairy    
 farms,with old buildings and linked to
 the road network by narrow lanes,but  
 being close to the main A38 Trunk road
 this area is no longer isolated.      
 This survey looks at certain people in
 the village,a farm,events,the         
 churches,trade and the community in   
 general in order that the user will   
 understand  what life is like.        </content>
