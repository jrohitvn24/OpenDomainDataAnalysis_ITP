 Bagnall and its surrounding area is   
very popular with tourists and         
particularly with the local town people
who use the area as a "break" from the 
hustle of town life.                   
  The main attractions to the village  
are the old styled village and its     
stone houses and the local country     
public house-"Stafford Arms" which     
during the summer months attracts large
numbers of people particularly evenings
and weekends which themselves create a 
problem for local residents with their 
parking.                               
  Another attraction is the annual fete
which is held during August.           
  The main attraction seems to be that 
its close proximity to the industrial  
towns of North Staffordshire provides a
welcome change with little travelling. </content>
