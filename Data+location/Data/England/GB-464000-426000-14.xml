 Interview with the Chairman of the    
 Parish Council.                       
 We asked Mr Jackson what being        
 chairman meant. He answered "Being    
 Chairman means conducting all the     
 Council meetings and advising fellow  
 Councillors on matters, also having   
 the casting vote on all decisions. The
 Council exists by Act of Parliament   
 and is a body of people representing  
 the Parish to administer its affairs. 
 Councillors are not paid. They are    
 elected every three years by the      
 residents of the village. A lot of    
 work is involved, e.g. plans have to  
 be discussed and the sites visited for
 observation. The local environment has
 to be protected and improved for the  
 benefit of everyone. Since 1962 the   
 population has risen from 200 to 1300 
 and this has caused problems.         </content>
