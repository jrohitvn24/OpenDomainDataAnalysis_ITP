		<title>12WISBOROUGH GREEN TAPESTRY</title>
		<content> In 1977, some people decided to       
 commemorate the Silver Jubilee of     
 Queen Elizabeth by embroidering a     
 tapestry depicting the history and    
 life of the village. Pat Gierth, a    
 local artist, made the design. It took
 eight years to complete and was       
 displayed in the church for the first 
 time in 1985.                         
    The border ,framing three panels,  
 shows the wildlife of the area. On    
 background designs of honeysuckle,    
 bindweed and ivy are cameo pictures of
 buildings, historical events and      
 activities to be seen in and around   
 the village.                          
    The middle panel centres on the    
 Green and the old and new school      
 buildings. The coloured wools used    
 reproduce colours that are to be found
 in the stained glass windows of the   
 church.                               </content>
