		<content> Manor farm dairy has cows, sheep and  
 horses. They have 350 cows and 100    
 sheep also two pet horses. A cow eats 
 potatoes, carrots and pancakes. A cow 
 does not give 12 months milk after    
 having a calf it only gives 2 months  
 milk.Then when the calf is about 12   
 days old they put them on the market  
 to be sold.The cow gives between 15   
 and 45 litres of milk a day. To keep  
 crops and animals they have 300 acres 
 of land. The sort of things they grow 
 are carrots , potatoes and they give  
 it to the shops and the cows.Silage   
 is made by cutting the grass and then 
 they bring it into a shed and cover   
 the grass up.They then put a chemical 
 on and leave it for 6 weeks.Their     
 guard dog's name is Jacob and         
 sometimes the dog rounds the sheep up.
