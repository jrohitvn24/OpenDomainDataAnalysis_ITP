		<content> We left school about9.30 I went       
 in Mr Friend's car to the Lydford     
 Forestry. Mr Friend is a Forestry     
 Commission Ranger. When we got there  
 we went to see some trees first. Then 
 we came back to get Spruce Karen's    
 dog, then we went for our walk through
 the Forestry. Most of the trees       
 are coniferous like Douglas Fir,      
 Norway Spruce, Sikta Spruce Japanese  
 Spruce and Southern Beech. When they  
 are fully grown they are about 100    
 feet.This takes about 100 years so    
 they are fast growers. The soft wood  
 is used for Paper and Fencing. There  
 is an Iron Age Fort in the Lydford    
 Forestry. It has recently been        
 discovered because the trees blocked  
 the view. It is about 2000 years old. 
 There are some red Deer in  the       
 Lydford Forestry but we did not see   
 any there.                            </content>
