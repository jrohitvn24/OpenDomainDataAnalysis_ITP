		<content>  The Norman Cathedral is a religious  
 and tourist centre. Three services are
 held daily. Approximately 300 000     
 people visit the Cathedral every year.
 Tourists are attracted by the         
 architecture, atmosphere and organ.   
 28% of the tourists are foreign       
 (mostly American).                    
  There are 4 vergers and one cleaner  
 working full time, one part time      
 cleaner, 5  masons, 4 office staff, an
 organist, 3 canons and the Dean.      
  It costs Â£4000 a week to run the     
 Cathedral and Â£100 000 a year to      
 maintain the 10 year restoration      
 programme.                            
  The Cathedral Bookshop was started by
 the head verger and sells souveniers, 
 books, postcards etc.                 
   The Cathedral is also used for      
 concerts, meetings and lectures.
