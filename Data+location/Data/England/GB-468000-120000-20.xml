		<title>20LIVING IN THE AREA</title>
		<content> The main problem of living in this    
 area is the isolation,since public    
 transport is so poor.As a result most 
 households have at least 1 car &amp; many 
 have 2 or more.Consequently those who 
 cannot afford or do not have their own
 transport(such as schoolchildren)often
 find it difficult to go shopping,visit
 friends etc.Many of the people who    
 live in this area have retired to it, 
 drawn by its attractive countryside   
 &amp; rural charm combined with nearness  
 to London.Many of the inhabitants of  
 the area have connections with the    
 Navy as a result of its nearness both 
 to Portsmouth &amp; to inland             
 establishments like H.M.S.Mercury.The 
 presence of so many incomers has      
 caused house prices to rise to high   
 levels so that many locals &amp; young    
 married couples cannot now afford to  
 buy their own property.               </content>
