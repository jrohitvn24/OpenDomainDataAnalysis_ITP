		<title>07Little Oakley</title>
		<content> The Oakleys derive their names from   
 once having been large{Oak woods}     
 although it is difficult to imagine   
 this now.Little Oakley is full of     
 interesting people and history,such as
 the{Oakley}family,who farm Burnthouse 
 farm.Their family name shows just how 
 long they have lived here,and old Mrs 
 Oakley didn't know how long the family
 had lived there,always she thought!   
 The{Old Rectory}was built in the      
 1700's with a wooden frame,but in 1770
 was red brick faced;it is now a       
 private residence.                    
{Little Oakley Hall}is Grade II listed 
 and has beautiful views over Hamford  
 waters.The family farm 600            
 acres,growing wheat,barley,duran      
 wheat,borage,apples,peas,and soft     
 fruit(pick your own).The farm is now  
 highly mechanized since labour costs  
 are high in the area,especially docks.</content>
