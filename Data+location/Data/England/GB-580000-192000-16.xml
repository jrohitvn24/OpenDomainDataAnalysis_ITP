		<title>16SOME KINDS OF MAMMALS</title>
		<content>                                       
                                       
      Some kinds of small mammals make 
 good pets.Rats mice gerbils and       
 hamsters are best kept indoors or at  
 least in an out building.The first    
 golden hamster to reach Britain were  
 brought here in 1931.You can get all  
 different breds of hamster.New breds  
 are being bred some hamsters now have 
 pale cream fur.The   body of a hamster
 is short and sturdy and a broad head  
 with a blunt nose and a set of fine   
 whiskers.If you are hoping for your   
 hamster to grow tame you should never 
 frighten him.Dont poke your fingers   
 into the cage because hamsters are    
 short sighted and they will think your
 finger is food and they bite.Do not   
 pick your hamster up when he is sleepy
 or make loud noises by his cage.
