		<title>02GEOGRAPHY-HISTORY OF HORBURY</title>
		<content> Horbury and South Osset are located on
 Millstone Grit hills overlooking      
 the River Calder four miles South West
 of Wakefield.The Pennine Hills which  
 dominate the north,are not as evident 
 as further west and so present no     
 problem to settlement or agriculture. 
  The area was settled in the sixth and
 seventh centuries by people moving    
 away from Waca's clearing             
 (Wakefield)after local tribal         
 arguments.Osla's camp (Osset) and the 
 Marsh stockade settlement (Horbury)   
 developed as a result.The site was    
 chosen as it was protected by         
 hills,had a spring and dominated a    
 ford (Addingford)and bridging point   
 (Horbury Bridge) across the Keld      
 Dubra or Calder.The textile revolution
 led to Horbury and Ossett becoming    
 towns in the nineteenth century and   
 having their own civic buildings.     </content>
