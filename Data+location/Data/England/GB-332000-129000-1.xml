 The land in our block is mostly       
 wetland.It is part of the Somerset    
 Levels and lies mainly between the    
 rivers{Parrett}and{Tone.}The river    
{Tone}joins the river{Parrett}near the 
 village of{Burrowbridge}which is in   
 the South East corner of our          
 block.Apart from this village and the 
 outskirts of the villages of Moorland 
 and Lyng there are very few dwellings.
 The land is divided into small        
 rectangular fields by drainage ditches
 or rhynes.There are several cattle    
 droves by which the farmers gain      
 access to their fields.The main road  
 A361 from{Taunton}passes through      
 Burrowbridge.The road from            
 Burrowbridge to Moorland is a narrow  
 country road with passing places at   
 intervals to enable cars to pass.The  
 only high ground is Burrow Mump.      </content>
