		<title>16WALKER PARK, PRENTON</title>
		<content>   This is named after a benefactor who
 gave the piece of land to the local   
 council, to be used exclusively as a  
 park. With an area of{15 acres,}it is 
 the smallest park in{Birkenhead.      
   There is an open grassed area on    
 which you can play games, a small wood
 of broadleaf trees, and several young 
 trees. There's a horse paddock with   
 jumps which the horses from a local   
 stables use for practice for shows.{  
   Clubs are not allowed to play       
 organized games such as cricket or    
 football, nor can golfers use it.     
   Over{80%}of the children in our     
 school use Walker Park, mostly for    
 playing ball games, but chase, cycling
 and walking are popular activities.   
{19%}of the children use it{most days  
 of the week and{20%}at the{weekend.   
   Cubs and Brownies sometimes hold    
 pack meetings in the park.            </content>
