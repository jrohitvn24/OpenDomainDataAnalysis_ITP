		<title>16CHURCH BELLS, POTT SHRIGLEY.</title>
		<content> A Bell-fund project has been          
 established at St. Christopher's      
 Church in order to increase the three 
 existing bells to six, producing the  
 acceptable sound of method ringing    
 which makes British churches unique in
 Europe. Two old bells were cast in    
 1437 and the third in 1607, any new   
 bells will have to be tuned to fit in 
 with them. After two years Â£8,000 has 
 been raised by dry-stone wall repairs,
 endowments, sponsored walks, bell     
 metal bought for melting and bank     
 interest. Around Â£11,000 will be      
 needed, a Herculean task for a village
 of some 230 inhabitants.
