		<title>14FOXRUSH AND MANOR FARM</title>
		<content> There are 2 farms to the southwest of 
 our square set under I.C.I works,     
 Foxrush and Manor farms.Foxrush is not
 a farm in its own right but part of a 
 unit based at Stokesley,the land being
 rented from Langbaugh council.Foxrush 
 has 110 acres:20 acres of winter wheat
 ,53 acres of winter barley,8 acres of 
 sprig barley,15 acres of oilseed rape.
 Which is used as a rotator.7 of his   
 acres are left fallow.                
 Mr.Barker,who owns Manor farm,has 300 
 acres which is divided as follows:100 
 acres of oilseed rape,100 acres winter
 wheat,100 acres of winter barley.     
 The farmers are more concerned about  
 children from the local housing estate
 ruining the crops,than polution from  
 I.C.I.                                
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
