		<title>03CHEDDAR STRAWBERRIES</title>
		<content>  Strawberries have been grown in the  
 Cheddar Valley for very many years.   
 The season starts in August when the  
 growers plant new runners taken from  
 the old plants.During the winter the  
 plants grow slowly and most are       
 protected from the cold winds by a    
 covering of polythene tunnels or glass
 cloches.Little white flowers appear in
 spring and it is then that straw is   
 put round the plants to keep the fruit
 clean when it forms a few weeks later.
 The first strawberries ripen in May   
 and cost about Â£2 for a pound.The     
 strawberries are packed in plastic    
 punnets and are sent by lorry to      
 markets in Birmingham,Cardiff,London, 
 Manchester and Bristol.Some of them   
 are sold from little stalls at the    
 side of the road together with early  
 potatoes,lettuces,beans and other     
 things the growers produce.           </content>
