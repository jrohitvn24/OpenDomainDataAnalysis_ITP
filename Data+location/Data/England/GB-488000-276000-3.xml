		<title>03Shopping Locally.</title>
		<content> There are several local shops which   
serve the needs of the people in the   
area.Civils super market is one.       
  We decided to do a quick survey to   
find out about shopping trends.        
Most popular purchases:Bread,Butter,   
                        Eggs.          
Busiest day:Saturday.                  
Many items are stocked and the store   
provides a cycle delivery service.     
 12 people work in the store which is  
one of a chain of local stores which   
are located in similar areas.People who
were asked said that they found the    
store very handy for things they had   
forgotten.                             
 {1000 people visit the store daily.}
