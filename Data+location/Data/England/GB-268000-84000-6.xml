		<content> Following a hearing the previous      
 year,the Commons Comissioner gave a   
 decision in Feb.1985 that Chagford    
 Parish Council should hold rights  on 
 behalf of all parishioners over       
 certain "open fields" for three       
 months of the year. The decision was  
 not welcomed by the fields' owners,   
 though they accept that some          
 unspecified rights may be involved.The
 Parish Council is trying to resolve   
 the position which is currently sub   
 judice.                               
{Swaling}_controlled burning of bracken
 _is a local custom to increase grass  
 growth and kill parasites such as     
 ticks.It must be over before 31 March.
{Other new events}which may become     
 annual include a Stallion show at     
 Collihole,Pony Club Camp at Buda and a
 Gymkhana at Waye Barton.
