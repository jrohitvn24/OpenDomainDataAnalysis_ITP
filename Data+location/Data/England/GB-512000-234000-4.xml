		<content> There are three thriving non-         
 conformist churches, Methodist,       
 Primitive Methodist and               
 Congregational. Ecumenical            
 relationships are healthy and         
 fruitful. Cubs, Scouts, Guides,       
 Brownies, Youth Groups, Playgroups,   
 Parents Groups, Womens Groups, groups 
 to enhance ones skills and sporting   
 aspirations or groups to discuss      
 mutual interests: they all thrive     
 here. Politics are varied and lively  
 and if anything needs to be done,     
 people don't sit around talking about 
 it, they set to and do it. At the     
 moment, a group of young mothers are  
 raising money to buy new equipment for
 the childrens playing field.          
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
