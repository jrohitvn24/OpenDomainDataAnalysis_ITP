		<title>15Health Clinic for Parbold?</title>
		<content>{       }The Committee are considering 
 the case for a Health Clinic in       
 Parbold, to serve about 5,000 people  
 from Parbold, Newburgh, and Dalton.   
 The local doctors have said that they 
 do not want a Health Centre, so it is 
 hoped that a clinic could provide help
 for young mothers, welfare food       
 distribution, dental services,        
 chiropody, etc. A single_storey       
 building measuring about 25 sq. metres
 would be needed, together with parking
 space. The siting of the Centre would 
 be in the area of the old Home Office 
 Store. If the scheme was fully        
 approved, then a period of about 8_10 
 years would be required before it was 
 complete.                             
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
