		<title>06EASINGTON TYTHE BARN</title>
		<content>{TYTHE BARN }Perhaps the oldest        
 Building in Easington after the church
 is the tythe barn.This barn has no    
 recorded history although its position
 only a few yards from the parish      
 church suggests that it was buit as   
 the church  barn late in the middle   
 ages sometime during the 14th Century.
{STRUCTURE}The barn is four and a half 
 bays long,with storage bays flanking a
 central bay in which threshing (by    
 hand flail) was done.The aisle and    
 gable walls are of brick;not original.
{ROOF}The roof is thatched with Norfolk
 reeds.It is hipped at both ends with  
 collars and ties of good scantlings   
 supported on a plate.The barn is the  
 last example of the Holderness        
 traditional timber and thatch         
 building.Behind the barn is an        
 Octagonal Horse Walk in brick.
