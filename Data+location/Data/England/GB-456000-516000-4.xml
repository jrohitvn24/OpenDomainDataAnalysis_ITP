		<content>    This area consists of a{steep      
{wooded hillside}which levels out at   
 the top to give an area of fields.Most
 of these fields are used for{grazing  
 either{sheep}or{cattle.}Two lines of  
 electricity{pylons}cross the square.  
  There is one building in this area   
 and that is an old{wheel house        
 belonging to the{mines.}It is along a 
 track which used to be a railway line 
 and is now very overgrown.It is known 
 as the{S.S Castle}because of the large
 iron S shaped metal strengtheners on  
 the walls.If you go inside there is a 
 long dark tunnel stretching hundreds  
 of feet deep.It had a wheel which     
 pulled trucks full of{iron ore}from   
 the mine.You can see the large round  
 hole where the big wheel used to be.
