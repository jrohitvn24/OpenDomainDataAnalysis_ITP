		<title>09EAST LODGE LITTLE OFFLEY</title>
		<content> We visited the family in East         
 Lodge,to discover all we could about  
 their employment and life style.Years 
 ago the cottage would have been the   
 lodge for Little Offley Manor House.We
 found there was a family of five      
 living there,who are self employed in 
 a family business.The business started
 in 1977,and the father now employs    
 both his sons.It is a haulage business
 and the bulk of the work is carriage  
 of agricultural food stuffs,within the
 local area,though occasionally trips  
 are made to Derbyshire.The business is
 run from home and the wife helps with 
 the book_keeping.                     
 At the rear of the house is a large   
 workshop where the owner repairs      
 commercial vehicles, for use in the   
 haulage business.There is a large     
 garden,part of which is cultivated to 
 produce vegetables.                   </content>
