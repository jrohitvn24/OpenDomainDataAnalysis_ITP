		<title>16MARSKE AREA - RELIGION</title>
		<content> The area is well catered for when it  
 come to Churches. There are two at    
 Marske and one at Downholme. Anglicans
 worship weekly at St Edmunds, Marske  
 and fortnightly at St Michaels,       
 Downholme. At present there is not a  
 resident Vicar in the area but it is  
 expected that soon these two Churches 
 will join with Richmond and           
 Hudswell.The Methodist Church is      
 situated at Clints. It is part of the 
 Reeth circuit and services are held   
 weekly by the Minister or a local     
 preacher. At least twice a year       
 Jehovahs Witnesses come into the area 
 to talk to the local people.
