		<title>19Ghost Stories of Rosehill.</title>
		<content>  These tales are part of the          
 "folklore" that has built up around   
 the old cinema at Rosehill.           
  When the cinema was being constructed
 in the 1930's one of the builders was 
 seen to fall from the scaffolding. He 
 is supposed to reappear and haunt the 
 building from time to time.           
  When cinema audiences were           
 entertained by the Organist, Rosehill 
 cinema audiences did not miss out.The 
 second tale concerns an organist who  
 collapsed and died while playing in   
 front of an audience.He also is       
 supposed to walk around what is now a 
 Bingo Hall and frighten the customers.
  He makes his presence felt by opening
 and shutting doors,  playing at an    
 organ which no longer exists and      
 causing cold air to rush past people  
 when no doors or windows are open.    
 A strange tale indeed!                </content>
