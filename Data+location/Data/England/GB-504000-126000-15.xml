 farmhouse. The animals kept are pigs, 
 cows, two horses and some chickens.   
 Whites Farm has some seventy acres of 
 land. The fields are used for grazing 
 and silage. The lane is rough and has 
 some beehives on the verge. There are 
 many buildings. The house has an      
 upstairs and an oak kitchen. The      
 kitchen floor is made of brick.       
      Whites Farm has a big garden with
 lots of roses and other plants. At the
 end of the garden is a pond which is  
 about fifteen feet deep. There are two
 geese there, one of which is called   
 Harry.                                
      The cattle are used as beef but  
 there used to be a dairy herd.There   
 are also some woods with a mixture of 
 trees.
