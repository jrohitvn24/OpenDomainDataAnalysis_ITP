		<title>20Village hall</title>
		<content> THe original school is now used as the
 village hall. It was built in 1845 and
 extended in 1884 to accomodate about  
 100 children (and a resident          
 mistress), although average attendance
 was about 60.                         
                                       
 The hall is used by some local clubs  
 and the playschool but it is not very 
 popular as it is cold and dark and has
 few facilities. There has been talk of
 building a new village hall.          
                                       
                                       
 The{parish magazine}keeps villagers   
 informed about local events.
