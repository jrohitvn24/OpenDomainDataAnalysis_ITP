		<title>15FARMING IN THE NEW FOREST</title>
		<content>   Last summer we went strawberry      
 picking for our first time .You can go
 picking from July till the end of the 
 summer.When we got there we had these 
 small plastic baskets and then we     
 started picking.Most of the time we   
 were eating them not picking them .   
   You can either keep them and pay for
 how much you picked or you can get    
 payed for how much you picked but you 
 dont get the strawberries .           
   When we had enough  we went home    
 and had strawberries with sugar on top
{YUM YUM YUM.}                         
   In the New Forest there are lots of 
 strawberry picking areas where you can
 go .Other than srawberries you can    
 pick potatoes, sweetcorn as well and  
 maybe other things.
