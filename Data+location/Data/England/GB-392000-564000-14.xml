		<content>{     THE RAILWAY STATION              
 Quite  alot as trains run  through    
 Hexham every day from Newcastle to    
 Carlisle Â£1.00.A bell rings when      
 a train is going to leave also        
 when the train is here so the people  
 know when the train is here so they   
 dont miss it . Hexham is the middle   
 station. There are signals on the     
 railway to warn of approaching trains.
 The signals are red with white stripes
 and are quite tall.The station has a  
 shop which sells sweets and newspapers
 to read on the train.It has a big blue
 bridge which goes from one side to the
 other side of the station.The trains  
 are blue with yellow front for        
 carrying people .But there are other  
 trains called freight trains which    
 carry coal,heaiy goods ect.they are   
 diesel trains.                        
                                       </content>
