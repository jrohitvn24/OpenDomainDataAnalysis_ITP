		<title>11FARMING</title>
		<content>      As stated in the review this is  
 mainly an agricultural area with      
 almost 100% of the available farmland 
 being grassland for dairy cattle.     
      The area is ideally suited for   
 this type of farming.It is not only   
 flat but receives relatively high     
 rainfall throughout the year.Also soil
 conditions combined with the use of   
 chemical fertilisers help to produce  
 high quality grass for pasture,silage 
 or hay.                               
      Therefore in this area it is     
 fairly obvious the farmer's main      
 preoccupation is with the continued   
 maintenance of his dairy herd.This,of 
 course,is his main source of income.  
 His year is geared to milking,        
 improving pasture land,cutting and    
 storing grass for silage and the      
 growing of winter cereals for fodder.
