		<content>{Erlams Beach}consists of shallow      
 mudflats with a shingle beach made up 
 of clay ridges, with some inlets of   
 sand and shingle. Small rock pools    
 weave in and out of the clay, and make
 for exciting finds of crabs, small sea
 creatures, shells, stones and seaweed.
                                       
 After this wide belt of clay there is 
 a ridge of small shell particles,     
 followed by pebbles and larger shells.
 At the top of the beach there is fine 
 sand with tufts of grass : beyond     
 that, salt marshes extend for some    
 distance (the marshes are drained by  
 natural outlets). In the marshes are  
 many interesting birds and sea plants.
                                       
 At the north end is a sea wall made of
 earth. Behind it lies an area once    
 used as a landfill, now grassed over  
 as a playing field.                   </content>
