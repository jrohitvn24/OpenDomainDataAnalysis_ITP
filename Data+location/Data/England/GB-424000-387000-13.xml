		<title>13LAND RECLAMATION</title>
		<content> The area of Rod Moor that was used by 
 the clay industry is marked with      
 shallow pits,which present no         
 eye-sore, but the north west corner   
 has a large disused quarry which is a 
 region of depressions surrounded by   
 banks of spoil,mainly shale, upon     
 which no vegetation grows. It is a    
 wet,desolate place,and only within a  
 few years been abandoned.             
 The father of the present owner of    
 Rod Moor planted a coniferous wood    
 along the edge of the moor above      
 Loadbrook and also around Platts.     
 The southernmost border of the area is
 the edge of the  Yorkshire Water      
 Authority plantation{Wyming Brook},   
 above Rivelin Reservoir.              
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
