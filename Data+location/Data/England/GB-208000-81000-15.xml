		<content>  Camelford needs more public toilets  
 because of coaches that stop in the   
 town local councillors heard last     
 week.                                 
  Mayor Michael Gee said that since a  
 seven foot high traffic barrier was   
 placed at the entrance to the         
 Churchfield Car Park coaches were     
 unable to stop to allow passengers to 
 use the toilets in Enfield Park .     
 They now parked up the other end of   
 town where toilets were needed.       
 The town council decided to take the  
 matters up with North Cornwall        
 District Council.                     
   A former Mayor told this week how   
 his peaceful stroll by a river was    
 rudely interrupted.                   
 Mr. Bill Perry was out walking his dog
 when he turned to find a bull behind  
 him.                          P.T.O.
