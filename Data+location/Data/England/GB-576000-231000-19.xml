		<title>19SOUTHEY GRN FARM,S.HED.</title>
		<content>    We went to{Southey Green Farm}     
 on the 20th June. They had 1200{sheep,
 200{lambs,}a total of 400{bulls}and   
{cows,}32{shire horses}and 5{standard }
{horses,}5{dogs}and lots of{cats.}     
    They own  270 acres of{land,}which 
 is mainly grazing.                    
    We saw some of the{bulls}in the    
 fields.They were sharing the pasture  
 with the{sheep}because sheep and      
 cattle get along well together.{Dogs }
 on farms have to be well trained so   
 that they do not worry the animals.   
 Two of the{dogs}were trained to round 
 up the sheep.                         
    The farmer does not own much{farm  
{machinery}but other farmers help him  
 out by loaning him some. We saw 3     
 tractors and trailers and were given a
 ride on one.                          
                                       
                                       </content>
