		<content>  There are two village committees in  
 Blennerhasset which organize trips and
 treats for the groups of people at the
 two ends of the age range. The        
 Children's Committee and The Old Folks
 Committee hold functions such as sales
 and flower shows to raise money for   
 these groups.                         
  In the summer there are free outings 
 to such places as Morecambe, and at   
 Christmas there are parties.          
  Plans are in hand for a sponsored    
 walk around the area to raise funds.  
 In August there is to be a village    
 show.
