		<title>02ARTS AND CRAFTS - SULLINGTON</title>
		<content> Examples of Art and Craft in          
 Sullington are to be found in the     
 Parish Church. One tapestry worked by 
 local people commemorates the marriage
 of the Prince and Princess of Wales.  
 Another, in memory of a former verger 
 who was a carpenter, was embroidered  
 by his daughter.                      
 Washington Church houses a memorial in
 the form of a carved table in memory  
 of those killed in the Second World   
 War 1939-1945.                        
 There are also some remarkable        
 hand-embroidered curtains of uncertain
 origin hanging in the Abbey in        
 Greyfriars Lane, and carvings in what 
 is now the Chapel include a bust of   
 Elizabeth I.
