		<title>13A MODERN PIG FARM.</title>
		<content> A modern pig farm, though smelly, is  
 super clean and germ free.   The      
 highly bred pigs have little          
 immunity and can collect germs easily.
 Everyone and all vehicles have to be  
 disinfectd.   The pigs are housed in  
 enormous brick sheds, hot and dark,   
 and never go outside.   Each pig is in
 a small pen, he can't turn around but 
 can back out into a larger straw      
 filled chamber.   Part of the pen     
 floor is a grid, underneath is a pit  
 to collect all the slurry which is    
 pumped into storage tanks and finally 
 used as fertilizer.   Some pig farms  
 produce meat, others mainly breeding  
 stock.   A typical breeding farm has  
 80 boars to serve 1050 sows, 6050     
 animals per company.   Each gilt      
 produces 5 litters in 2 years,        
 averaging 9 live births.   The piglets
 are weaned at three to six weeks.     </content>
