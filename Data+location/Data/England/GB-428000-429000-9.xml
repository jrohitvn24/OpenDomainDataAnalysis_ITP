		<title>09HOUSING IN SOUTH LEEDS</title>
		<content>  The area grew in size as Leeds became
 an important industrial city. As a    
 result of this the whole area is      
 mainly Victorian, Edwardian and Pre_  
 war housing.                          
  There is a lot of back to back       
 housing and terraced through housing  
 in the area, quite a lot of which has 
 been, or is in the process of being   
 modernised. There is also a lot of    
 council housing in the Belle Isle area
 which is mainly semi-detatched. These 
 houses were built in the 1930's as a  
 result of the Rt. Rev.Jenkinson,leader
 of the ruling Labour Council, who     
 wanted to rehouse families from the   
 inner city slums.                     
  Before Beeston, Cross Flatts and     
 Hunslet were swallowed up by Leeds    
 they were small villages and in fact  
 Beeston was mentioned in the Domesday 
 Book of 1086.                         </content>
