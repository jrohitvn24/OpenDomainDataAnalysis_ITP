		<title>02AN INTRODUCTION TO HEMINGBY.</title>
		<content> Hemingby has about 300 residents.     
 During the last fifteen years a lot of
 new buildings, mainly bungalows have  
 been erected.The village will not be  
 allowed to extend its boundaries      
 further; new houses may only be       
 erected in existing gaps.Most of the  
 houses are red brick.About fifty of   
 the inhabitants are involved in       
 agricultural work.The village has     
 had a church since at least the       
 fifteenth century.The present church  
 was erected in 1896. It is made of    
 stone. The methodist church is now    
 derelict. The village has a public    
 house,(one of the oldest buildings    
 in the village) called the 'Coach and 
 Horses'.There is a post office and    
 village store with plant nursery.The  
 village school, which closed in 1970  
 has been converted into a well used   
 village hall. {                       </content>
