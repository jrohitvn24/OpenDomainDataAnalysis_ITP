		<title>17Stop Digging in Jersey</title>
		<content>      The States of Jersey are telling 
 the farmers to stop digging potatoes. 
 Why? Because the potatoes we ship     
 abroad go to the English markets to   
 sell; but if we export too many       
 potatoes in one go, the English       
 markets will not be able to sell them 
 all and they will have to sell them   
 cheaply to get rid of them. The       
 farmers will lose money. So it is     
 better to export a steady flow of     
 potatoes. Although it may seem silly  
 to stop the farmers digging with lots 
 of potatoes in the fields, it is      
 better for the farmers later on       
 because it is better to have a steady 
 price throughout the season than a    
 couple of good weeks followed by a    
 disaster.                             
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
