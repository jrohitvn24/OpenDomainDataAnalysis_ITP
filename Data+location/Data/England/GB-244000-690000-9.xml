		<content> Mallard duck. This bird is found in   
 the fields,woodland,marshes and even  
 in low trees. The mallard eats fish,  
 insects,frogs,grain,snails and        
 berries. During the summer the mallard
 stays near fresh water (Mar burn). In 
 winter it goes along the seashore.    
 Red and Grey squirrel.The red squirrel
 is found mainly in the pine woods     
 around here.The grey squirrel,which   
 was brought to Britain from N.America 
 is more common. We see more grey      
 squirrels here. A squirrel's nest is  
 called a drey.                        
 Roe deer. These live on moorland or in
 the woods. The male has antlers but   
 the doe does not. They eat twigs and  
 young shoots and do a lot of damage to
 the trees.                            
 Fox.The fox goes hunting at night for 
 birds,rabbits and poultry. He is a    
 nuisance on the farms here.           </content>
