		<title>06SHAKESPEARE'S HOME</title>
		<content> Mary Ardens house is at Wilmcote. It  
 was the home of William Shakespeare's 
 mother and was built in 1410. It was a
 typical farm house of the time and    
 still has the original furniture      
 outside that is a museum housing      
 historic farm implements.             
 The property is owned by the          
 Shakespeare birthplace Trust and is   
 visited each year by one hundred      
 thousand people of all nationalities. 
 The house is open every day in the    
 spring, summer and autumn but is      
 closed on Sunday in the winter. An old
 barn                                  
 has just been restored at the back of 
 the property to form a new museum.
