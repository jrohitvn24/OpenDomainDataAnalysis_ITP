		<content>  History reveals that a Manor House   
 existed at Epperstone at the time of  
 the Norman Conquest and certainly     
 mention is made of it in the Domesday 
 Book in 1086.                         
  Over the years many alterations and  
 additions have been taken to preserve 
 the character and style of this       
 beautiful house.The panelled hall and 
 Jacobean style staircase, the elegant 
 plasterwork ceiling in the Garden Room
 are worthy of note.Occupancy of the   
 Manor has changed hands on numerous   
 occasions over the years, and was once
 believed to be the residence of Lord  
 Howe, Governor of Barbados.           
  The Manor became the former County   
 Police H.Q. in 1954 until the         
 amalgamation with the Nottingham City 
 Police in 1968 when it was developed  
 as the Police Training School.
