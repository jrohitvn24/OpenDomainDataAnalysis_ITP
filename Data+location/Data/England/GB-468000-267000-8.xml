		<content> VARIOUS FASHIONABLE PURSUITS MAY BE   
 SEEN IN THIS RURAL AREA, AT ALL LEVELS
 OF SOCIETY.                           
 THE RICH LANDOWNERS ARE PREOCCUPIED   
 WITH SHOOTING GAME - PARTICULARLY     
 PHEASANTS WHICH THEY REAR SPECIFICALLY
 FOR THIS PURPOSE, CONSEQUENTLY THESE  
 BIRDS REPRESENT A FAIRLY COMMON SIGHT.
 A FEW SELECT RESTAURANTS ARE SITUATED 
 IN THE AREA AND APPEAR TO THRIVE ON   
 THE CUSTOM ATTRACTED FROM NORTHAMPTON 
 OR VIA THE ADJACENT MOTORWAY FROM THE 
 GENERAL MIDLANDS AREA.                
 BECAUSE SPRATTON IS A RATHER LARGE    
 VILLAGE IT HAS A GREATER DIVERSITY OF 
 PROVISION AND BOASTS A YOUTH CLUB     
 WHERE LOCAL YOUNGSTERS MAY MEET TO    
 LISTEN TO POP MUSIC AND DISCUSS ITS   
 RELATIVE MERITS OR OTHERWISE.         
 THERE IS ALSO A CONSERVATIVE CLUB     
 WHICH IS SOCIALLY ORIENTATED AS MUCH  
 AS POLITICAL.                         </content>
