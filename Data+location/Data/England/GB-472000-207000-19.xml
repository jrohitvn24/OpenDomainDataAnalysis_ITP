{1981}and is very different from the   
 old school. The new school has 4      
 classrooms. It has an office for the  
 Head Teacher and another office for   
 Mrs Brown who is the secretary and    
 welfare assistant.                    
 There are lots of pictures on the     
 walls and the children have nice books
 to read and nice paper to write on.   
 There is a{large hall}with PE         
 equipment and a kitchen where the     
 cooks make dinner.                    
 The children do different subjects    
 each month and lots of other things as
 well, like{Sports Day}and{Domesday    
{surveys.                              
 Our Mums and Dads went to the old     
 school, but we are much luckier.
