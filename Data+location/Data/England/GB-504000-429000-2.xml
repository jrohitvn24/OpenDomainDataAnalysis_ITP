		<title>02NATIONAL AVENUE AREA.</title>
		<content> This area (06.30) is mainly houses,   
 particularly a large housing estate to
 the north. This is a particularly     
 attractive area with plenty of grassed
 areas and a very quiet neighbourhood. 
 Approximately half of the remaining   
 area is sports grounds and play areas,
 some public and some owned by firms in
 the vicinity.                         
  The remaining land is occupied by    
 industrial estates. The size and type 
 of factory unit varies greatly. The   
 largest estate is of fairly recent    
 construction, one factory being only  
 two months old. The various firms     
 comprise of television distributors,  
 radiator manufacturers, pump makers,  
 vehicle repair shops and haulage      
 firms.
