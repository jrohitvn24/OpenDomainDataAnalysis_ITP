		<content>  This area is mainly intensively      
 managed grassland. It is mainly dairy 
 farming with a few sheep.             
  A main road dissects this section,   
 also a very minor road which at one   
 time was the original carriageway to  
 Stone and Leek.                       
  The hedgerows are thick with saplings
 of oak and beech and many others.     
  There are several pools around which 
 are used by Angling Clubs one of which
 was the British Legion Fenton Angling 
 Club                                  
  At the northern part of the section a
 short bridle path crossed the main    
 road and joins the two Hamlets of     
 Hobbergate and Knenhall.              
  Including the farms there are only   
 about ten dwellings in this area.     
 There are no shops, but there is a Bus
 service which runs for twelve routes  
 daily at intervals of thirty minutes. </content>
