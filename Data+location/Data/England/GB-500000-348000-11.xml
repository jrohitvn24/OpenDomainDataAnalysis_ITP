		<title>11A LOCAL FARM</title>
		<content> My grandad works on a farm near       
 Cranwell village. My gran feeds the   
 calves, and the cows are milked and   
 washed. Grandad uses tractors to fetch
 hay and straw for the cows and leaves 
 it in the barn. There is a pump house 
 to keep the water going to the cow    
 shed. In the dairy there is a tank    
 where the milk is collected, a lorry  
 comes once a week to fetch the milk.  
 When it is time for milking a hooter  
 sounds, this is about four o'clock in 
 the afternoon. The cows are led into  
 the dairy by someone on a tractor. In 
 a little room near to the dairy there 
 are two boards which contain the      
 number of each cow, and show how much 
 milk is given. When milking is over   
 the cows go down the steps and back to
 the field.
