		<content> This area is rural and has a very     
 small population. Even its one        
 settlement, Wennington, has only about
 20 people. The main living of the     
 population is from farming. The land  
 is good pasture land for grazing dairy
 cattle and sheep. Several of the farms
 are quite large and have been         
 established for many generations.     
 Apart from farming there is little    
 employment, so that non-farmers tend  
 to be professional people, generally  
 working in Lancaster, about 10 miles  
 away.                                 
 The area is bereft of amenities -     
 indeed there is not even a shop within
 it. Much shopping is done therefore in
 High Bentham, about 4 miles east of   
 Wennington, but the majority of       
 shopping is done in Lancaster, which  
 is also the major centre of           
 entertainment in the area.            </content>
