		<content> The area is typical of Shropshire     
 Plain farming country.  Although some 
 hedgerows have been destroyed because 
 of financial inentives offered, many  
 remain to contribute to the insect,   
 animal and bird life, which is richly 
 varied.  The compromise between       
 financial expediency and conservation 
 also applies to the retention of      
 coppice, woodlands and standard -     
 usually deciduous - trees.            
 Crop-spraying does cause some         
 pollution.  The river has also been   
 polluted by a discharge of pig slurry 
 but it is now recovering. The climate 
 generally is moderate but very low    
 temperatures are sometimes recorded   
 during Winter and heavy snowfalls are 
 not uncommon.
