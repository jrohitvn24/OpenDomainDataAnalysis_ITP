		<title>04THEALE COMMERCIAL ESTATE</title>
		<content> This is a small development of light  
 industrial warehouse units which was  
 built in 1983 and 1984 on a site      
 adjacent to the Prestcold works in    
 Station Road Theale. The site is owned
 by Norwich Union, an insurance company
 and was built as twelve units each    
 including a limited amount of office  
 accomodation. Most of the units are   
 occupied and include a variety of     
 different industries (Chemicals,      
 Metals, Printing etc.).  Some of the  
 units have been combined to form      
 larger units. The largest unit of some
 60,000 sq.ft. remains unoccupied.     
 Theale Commercial Estate is well      
 located being close to Junction 12 of 
 the M4 Motorway which provides        
 first-class links to most parts of the
 country including London and its      
 Heathrow airport.  Theale railway     
 station is also nearby.               </content>
