		<content>    The owners name is Mr.Gunnell,and  
 he has two sons,both in their twenties
 and one tractor driver. They have 50  
 bullocks,and 1 cow for milking. They  
 used to have 2000 litres of milk a day
 -two tanks full.One cow would give ten
 gallons a day, if it felt good. 100   
 cows were milked. The oldest cow is 13
 years old.                            
    The farmers put oats in little     
 lofts above the feeding troughs for   
 animals. Rats bother Mr.Gunnell,but he
 has to get rid of them. They used to  
 buy 2000 bails of hay, but now only   
 1000.                                 
    They have 7 tractors of several    
 different makes. The 525 Massey       
 Fergusson,is the Combine Harvester.The
 knives cut the corn. Altogether,they  
 own 300 acres. They get up at 6.00,and
 milk cows at 6.30 in the morning and  
 night.                                </content>
