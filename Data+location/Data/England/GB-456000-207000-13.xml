		<title>13Holton wood</title>
		<content>Holton wood is owned by Shotover       
Estate.There are a variety of trees at 
holton wood such as oak,ash,silver     
birch,sycamore,elder berry.Lots of     
bushes grow round the trees like       
bracken and hawrthorn.The wood is an   
area of scientific intrest so owners   
are not allowed to do things to the    
forest like cut down any more          
trees.There are many wild flowers      
growing in Holton wood. We saw         
buttercups,forget me nots,white        
nettels,white campion,blue bells and   
cow parsly.We saw ivy attached to tree 
trunks. It strangles the trees.We saw  
a weed called sterile broom.It grows   
around the edge of the fields. If the  
farmer deos not kill it with  weed     
killer it will take over the crops.    
We saw fallow deer and munt deer. They 
keep pheasants in a pen and shoot them 
for sport in the autumn.               </content>
