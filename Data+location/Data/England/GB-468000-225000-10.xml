		<content> Compulsory education in               
 Buckinghamshire begins the term after 
 a child reaches his 5th birthday.Prior
 to that Toddlers Group,Playschool and 
 Rising Fives Group (all{voluntary     
 groups charging fees) provide early   
 education from the age of 3.          
 From 5 to 12 the child is taught at   
 the{Allan Shaw Combined}School.This is
 housed in a modern,open-plan building 
 with a swimming pool and large playing
 fields.In 1986 further new facilities 
 will be opened and the old building   
 will finally become redundant.        
 In their final year in the Combined   
 School children take three{45 minutes 
{tests,}which coupled with the school's
 recommendations,decide whether they go
 to{Grammar School}(Royal              
 Latin,Buckingham) or{Secondary Modern 
 (Buckingham Secondary) where they     
 remain until 16.                      </content>
