		<content> The village of Brockenhurst and the   
 surrounding area offers a wide variety
 of people, housing, entertainments,   
 facilities and events. In a village   
 whose population can triple in a      
 weekend, where London executives live 
 alongside water bailiffs and          
 gamekeepers, it is expected that      
 difficulties and conflicts of interest
 will arise. The village tries to      
 retain its individual identity but    
 finds the pressure of tourism very    
 demanding. Educationally the village  
 supports a huge student population of 
 1200 children between 3 and 18 some of
 whom travel up to 20 miles to attend  
 college yet the children aged 11-16   
 must travel out of Brockenhurst into  
 Dorset for their education. An unusual
 area but a very nice place to live.
