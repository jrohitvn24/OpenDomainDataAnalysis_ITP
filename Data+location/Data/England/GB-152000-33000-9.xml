		<content>           The Church                  
      Nothing is known of the first    
 Church of St.Erth, or of others which 
 may have succeeded it until the       
 present Church was originally built in
 the l4th or l5th centuries.   The     
 present Nave has some early           
 Perpendicular work, with the Chancel a
 little earlier in the Transitional    
 period.   The Tower, which is without 
 buttresses, is l4th century.          
      The difficulty of dating the     
 Church with accuracy arises from the  
 extensive restoration and rebuilding  
 carried out.   Vicar Collins, in l747,
 showing great zeal in his removals and
 repairs, and even more extensive      
 re-building was instigated by Vicar   
 Mills in l873.
