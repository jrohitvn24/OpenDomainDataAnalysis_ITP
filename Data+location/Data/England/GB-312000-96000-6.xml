		<content> Some Events of the Village Year       
                                       
 Many events centre around             
 fund-raising, either for the          
 Church,Hall or W.I. But the custom of 
 Tip-Tip-Toe, which may have stemmed   
 from beating of the bounds, is carried
 out by the school children on Shrove  
 Tuesday.                              
 The Fete in June, Flower Show in      
 August and, this year, a Barn Dance in
 May, are great events in which all can
 take part. Refreshments are provided  
 by the ladies of the village and      
 drinks by a local pub or bought in for
 the occasion.                         
 This year Morris-men came and danced  
 in the village centre.                
 Bonfire night is celebrated with an   
 enormous fire in a nearby field,      
 fireworks and food.
