		<title>06POPULATION OF ARNCLIFFE</title>
		<content>   In 1985 there were 69 people living 
 in Arncliffe, 51 adults and 18        
 children.  Of the adults 25 were males
 and 26 females.  Nine of the children 
 attended Arncliffe School, and two    
 older children attended secondary     
 school in Grassington.   Seven        
 children were under school age.  In   
 the under-five group were one-year-old
 boy triplets.                         
   Of the 28 households three are      
 engaged in tourism, and eight are     
 farming families, a further three     
 being involved in farming in some way,
 whilst there is one gamekeeper.  Three
 people are employed in part-time jobs 
 at the school.  There are several     
 households where at least one member  
 is of retirement age.  Two men commute
 considerable distances daily to work  
 in Leeds and Manchester.  Several     
 people find seasonal work in tourism. </content>
