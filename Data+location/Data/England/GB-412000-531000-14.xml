		<content>{Written by Miss Ramshaw,who has lived 
{in the village for over seventy years.
 The Vicar at that time,1914,was the   
 Rev.James Hodgson,who was responsible 
 for the present church building.      
 Although almost 90 years old,his      
 hearing was good and he did not need  
 spectacles.The Vicarage (on the same  
 site as the present one) was a low    
 whitewashed building.A flight of steps
 led down to the front door, and I     
 remember a pump in the middle of the  
 kitchen floor from which water was    
 drawn.There were also two pumps in the
 village,one on the green and one near 
 the Sunday School.this building had   
 been the Day School in the early part 
 of the 19th century.                  
 The Sunday School was supervised by   
 Miss Mary Jopling for many years,Mr   
 Hodgson refusing to have anything to  
 do with it.                           </content>
