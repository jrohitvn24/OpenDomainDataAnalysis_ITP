		<title>15CROPS GROWN IN KENT</title>
		<content>Bockingfold farm has 171 acres of      
cereals. Under this category comes     
wheat and barley. When we were looking 
at the barley we noticed the outside   
was lighter than the inside of the     
field. This was because they had       
sprayed the outer edge to protect the  
barley from a disease called septoria  
(like mildew). They didn't spray the   
middle because they didn't want tracks 
going through the barley. They used a  
machine with an arm which extended 40  
feet from the edge of the field.       
 The winter wheat is used for making   
bread. The longbow variety is used as  
animal feed. The spring barley is used 
for making whisky and beer.            
 Rape is also grown. Many Kent farms   
have started growing it in the last 2  
years because it is more profitable at 
the moment than hops. It is used to    
make cooking oil and margarine.        </content>
