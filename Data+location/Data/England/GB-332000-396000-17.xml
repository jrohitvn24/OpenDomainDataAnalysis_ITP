		<title>17Our Local Newspaper....Part1</title>
		<content> Our local,weekly newspaper is the     
 Bootle Times.It tells us about the    
 things that are happening in our area.
 Some of the news is a pleasure to read
 such as how a group of school children
 raised Â£165 from a concert to help the
 Leukaemia Research Fund and how       
 firemen rescued an 88 year old        
 disabled man who was trapped in a     
 house fire. Unfortunately,most news is
 bad news,like that about the 80 year  
 old woman who was killed after being  
 hit over the head with an iron bar,by 
 a youth who had broken into her home. 
 Another news item was about drug      
 pushers and there was an item about a 
 38 year old man who was charged with  
 possession of firearms and ammunition.
 This week there was a report about a  
 burst water main which wrecked a new  
 road surface,flooding the road and    
 bringing traffic to a standstill.     </content>
