A police beat officer's house and      
office are situated in Shenstone Wood  
End to the east of the area, this comes
under the Divisional H.Q. at Lichfield.
The beat policeman is responsible for  
constantly patrolling throughout the   
area, of which he has a very extensive 
knowledge and he is well acquainted    
with the inhabitants.                  
The village Community Association is   
represented on the Police Consultative 
Committee which meets three times a    
year as a means of communication       
between the Committee and Police.  It  
is hoped in the near future to         
investigate the desirability of a      
Community Watch to combat crime.
