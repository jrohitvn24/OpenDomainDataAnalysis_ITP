		<content> I live in Norfolk Drive in the        
{Tilekiln Estate,}near the Castleham   
 Industrial Estate.It is a new estate, 
 and is planned in an interesting way. 
 There are terraced, semi-detatched,   
 detatched,houses and bungalows.My     
 house is semi-detatched.It has three  
 storeys. It's a nice area to live in  
 because it has quite a lot of{play    
{parks,}and not many roads just foot   
 paths. The only local shop is Tesco   
 Superstore, which everyone uses.      
 The bunglows are made of bricks and   
 cement, they have a balcony.The       
 houses are made from the same material
 but they have a garden. Some houses   
 are painted attractive colours; trees 
 and shrubs are planted in many places.
 We nickname one playpark the 'Sandpit'
 because it was a sandpit about two    
 years ago, and another the 'Rocket'   
 because it has 2 slides like rockets. </content>
