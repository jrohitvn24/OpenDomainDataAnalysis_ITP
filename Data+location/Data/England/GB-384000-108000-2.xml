		<title>02Shrove Tuesday in Durweston</title>
		<content>       We be come a-shroven,           
       For a piece of pancake,         
       Or a piece of bacon,            
       Or a little truckle cheese      
       Of your own maken.              
       So blow the fire, heat the pan, 
       For we be come a-shroven.       
  The children of Durweston First      
 School go Shroving around the village 
 on Shrove Tuesday singing this song.  
 We go in two groups to all the houses,
 and people give us money which is     
 shared out amongst the children.      
  Mr Valentine Rickman is a man who    
 died in 1925 and he wanted the        
 children to keep up the tradition.    
  My Dad went Shroving when he was at  
 Durweston School. My Grandma gave all 
 the children an orange each when they 
 called at the village shop. It reminds
 the older people of when they were    
 young and went Shroving themselves.   </content>
