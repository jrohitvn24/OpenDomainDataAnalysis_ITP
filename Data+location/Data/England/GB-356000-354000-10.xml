		<title>10MONTHLY MEETING HAUGHTON W.I</title>
		<content> _______________________________       
 The meeting opened with the hymn      
 'Jerusalem', written by William Blake 
 and sung to the tune of Sir C.H.H.    
 Parry. After the minutes, several     
 topics were discussed; a course of    
 upholstery and lampshade making are to
 be run during the winter, theatre     
 visits are planned - the Christmas    
 pantomime especially seems very       
 popular with two coaches already      
 booked, the Domesday project was      
 discussed together with the Christmas 
 party and a shopping trip to          
 Liverpool. It was also decided that   
 the hand made blanket made recently by
 some of the ladies should be given to 
 an elderly member. Tea and homemade   
 bisuits were followed by a very       
 enjoyable talk by Mr.Ellis on the     
 Castles of Edward 1, illustrated by a 
 slide show of his own photographs.    </content>
