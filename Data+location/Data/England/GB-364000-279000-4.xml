 Much of the land is held in areas of  
 less than 10 acres. calves are reared,
 land grazed by sheep or the grass mown
 for hay, but these enterprises do not 
 provide the main income of the        
 household. On the small farms (less   
 than 100 acres) farming is combined   
 with other business e.g. building.    
 Three properties of small area are    
 cultivated as nurseries, but although 
 very many other properties have an    
 acre or so of land they rarely use it 
 for profit. Arable crops are confined 
 to the few larger farms, one of which 
 is almost entirely arable.
