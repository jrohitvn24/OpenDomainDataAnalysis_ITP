		<title>02The Toll Cottage in Williton</title>
		<content> We went to look at an{old cottage}that
 was being repaired.   When we were    
 there we saw an{old window that went  
{down to the ground.}  In the olden    
 days the cottage was a{Toll Cottage. }
 The{toll keeper}used to  sit by the   
 window and watch for people to come   
 by.   When some one came along he     
 would come out of the cottage and put 
 the barrier down.   Then he would ask 
 them for the toll and the toll keeper 
 let them by.   It was a small cottage 
 and the window that the toll keeper   
 sat by had an iron bar down the middle
 of it to stop burglars coming in.     
 The cottage was made of{stone. }      
{Builders uncovered the window}when    
 they were taking the plaster off.     
 There was another{small window}that   
 the toll keeper used. He let down a   
 bucket when he was in bed so that     
 people put their toll in it.          </content>
