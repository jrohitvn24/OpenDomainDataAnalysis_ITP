		<content> The{estate agent}told us that in this 
 area women were more interested in the
 bathroom and the kitchen and these two
 features would usually sell a house,  
 although a large garden was also a big
 selling feature. Certain people would 
 only ever buy a new house but a common
 complaint was that gardens of new     
 houses were often thought to be too   
 small. The reason for this was that   
 land was so expensive that builders   
 often had to make gardens smaller so  
 that they could fit more houses ,on   
 to a plot.                            
 Brickwork and double cavities made    
 houses more heat efficient nowadays,  
 though it probably made them carry    
 more noise through party walls. Wood  
 was no longer seasoned for a long time
 in the open but dried artificially and
 this made wood go rotten very quickly.
