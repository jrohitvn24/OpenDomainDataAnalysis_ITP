		<content>    We have got three Churches in our  
 village.One is an Independent         
 Church.One is a Methodist Church and  
 one is a Parish Church.  I go to the  
 Parish Church because I think it is   
 more beautiful, I am in the Choir.    
 The Methodist Church is more modern   
 but not as beautiful.I have never been
 to the other Church so I don't know   
 what it is like inside, all I know is 
 that it is small.I like the service in
 the Parish Church very much.          
{ } There are Sunday Schools at most of
 these Churches.  There is one at the  
 Parish Church organised during church 
 services.The young children go to     
 another room just before the Sermon   
 and come back at the end of the       
 service.
