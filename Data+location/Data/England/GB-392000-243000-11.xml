		<content>{FAMILY LIFE}                          
 Mrs Shaw has two children and used to 
 live in the centre of Pershore before 
 she moved to Drakes Broughton, just   
 outside Pershore.  The Shaw family    
 moved house because they wanted to    
 live in a bigger house but were sad to
 leave Pershore.  During the week she  
 teaches but in her spare time she does
 art and music.  Sometimes the family  
 go out at the weekend but only        
 locally.  If they don't she does work 
 for her job or reads.                 
 Mrs Shaw noticed that there were a lot
 of people moving in and out of the    
 area, probably because they are middle
 class, upwardly mobile type of young  
 executive.                            
 On Sunday Mrs Shaw and family go to   
 church and sometimes they have        
 visitors afterwards.
