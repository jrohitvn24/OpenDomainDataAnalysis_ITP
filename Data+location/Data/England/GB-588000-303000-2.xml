		<title>02POPULATION OF ASHILL VILLAGE</title>
		<content> The present population of{Ashill}is   
 approx 1450, including approx 250     
 under the age of 18.                  
 The village has grown to its present  
 size from a population of 500 in the  
 mid 1960's, the "newcomers" live on a 
 number of new estates which consist   
 largely of bungalows,{(Fairholme,     
{Millfield, Lewis Cl., Acacia Av.,     
{Woodlands, Orchard Cl. and The Limes) 
 and some of houses,{(The Oaks, Fir    
{Park and The Meres).}The bungalows are
 largely inhabited by "retired"        
 pensioners, a high proportion from the
 London area, whilst the houses are    
 mainly inhabited by families. The high
 proportion of bungalows reflect the   
 number of retired people in the       
 village, approx 50%, these are partly 
 balanced by the younger families so a 
 reasonable mix of ages is achieved.   
 New and old villagers usually mix well</content>
