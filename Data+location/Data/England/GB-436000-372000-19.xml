		<title>19Travelling Fair</title>
		<content>  A travelling fair comes to Stand Road
 Park three or four times every year.  
 The local children help the fairground
 people to build it up when it arrives 
 and to take it down before they move  
 on. All the children like the fair    
 with its bright lights and very loud  
 music. They don't seem to mind the mud
 or dust which they have to walk in to 
 get to the various stalls where small 
 prizes such as a goldfish can be won, 
 for example, at darts or rolling small
 balls into numbered holes. There are  
 little merry-go-rounds for the small  
 children to ride on and, for the older
 ones, there are more exciting rides   
 like the Waltzer which goes round and 
 round at a fast speed, the Big Wheel  
 which takes you high into the air, and
 Dodgems which test your skills as a   
 driver. Also, you will find toffee    
 apple, hot-dog &amp; candy-floss stalls.  </content>
