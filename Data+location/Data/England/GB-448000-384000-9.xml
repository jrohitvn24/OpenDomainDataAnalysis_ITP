		<content> In 1968{Todwick School}was completed. 
 In school we have six full time       
 teachers, ten other staff, six ladies 
 in the kitchen and three dining room  
 ladies. We have a 'lollipop lady' that
 helps us over the road, two cleaning  
 ladies and one caretaker. In school   
 we have 169 children altogether with  
 the largest class having 32 children  
 and the smallest 24. The youngest     
 children are four years old and       
 we leave the primary school at the age
 of eleven. In class we do Maths which 
 seems to be harder as you get older   
 and older . We do English and topic   
 work about animals,people and         
 mechanical things. I think art is the 
 best thing of all  when you can       
 paint a picture or make a model out   
 of clay, plaster, wood or card.
