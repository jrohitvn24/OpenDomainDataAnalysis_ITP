		<title>01Overall view of Hanley Swan</title>
		<content> This rural area is mainly agricultural
 but includes two Hanley villages,     
 Hanley Swan and Hanley Castle. It lies
 at the foot of the Malvern Hills, and 
 the hills are visible forming an      
 attractive backcloth to this very     
 beautiful district. Small to average  
 sized farms dominate the area.There   
 are caravan parks nearby so tourists  
 are encouraged to discover and enjoy  
 what the countryside has to offer,by  
 following well marked footpaths.      
 However this is not an area which     
 encourages large numbers of visitors  
 as it has few facilities and enjoys   
 its quietness and privacy.            
         Hanley Swan is well known     
 locally for its pond and village      
 green, on which stands an old and     
 huge oak tree. This affords local     
 and visiting artists much interest.
