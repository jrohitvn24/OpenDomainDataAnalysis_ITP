		<title>18HOMES IN LERRYN &amp; BOCONNOC</title>
		<content>      Most of the houses in the area   
 are over 100 years old.{Lerryn}is a   
{conservation area}so it is very       
 difficult to get planning permission  
 to build new houses.                  
      The homes are mainly{cottages}or 
{bungalows.}Many of the old buildings  
 such as the{granary, the mill, old    
{warehouses, lime kilns}and{barns}have 
 been converted into residences.       
      There are some{council properties
 in{Lerryn,}which are either owned or  
 rented by their occupants.            
      The relatively{high cost}of      
 property in Lerryn and Couch's Mill   
 means that few young people can       
 afford to buy it, so many of the      
 houses have been sold off to people   
 from other parts of the country, as   
{holiday homes.                        
                                       
                                       </content>
