		<title>15FEERING SCHOOL</title>
		<content>{Feering school }is an old school, it  
 is smaller than {St.Marys in Kelvedon.
 The{school}is much taller than        
 ours.They have lots of problems like  
 they haven't got a sports hall. They  
 have got two plaques on the walls of  
 two rooms they are; {DRUMOND ROOM IN  
{MEMORY OF REV. R. DRUMOND. VICAR OF   
{FEERING 1830-1880 }the other plaque   
 says;{PACKE ROOM IN MEMORY OF REV.    
{W.J. PACKE VICAR OF FEERING           
{1881-1909.}There are only 25 children 
 in each junior class, and in the      
 infants they like to keep the number  
 of children below 20 so altogether    
 there are 70_80 children. There is    
 going to be a new school built about  
 Chistmas because the old one is       
 falling apart. It is going to  be     
 built on part of Rye Mill Lane playing
 field.
