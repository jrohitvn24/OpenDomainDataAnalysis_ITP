		<title>15A Small Farm Near Redditch.</title>
		<content>{'Laurel Farm',}owned by Mr. and Mrs.  
 Dickenson in{Beoley}has been handed   
 down through{several generations.}They
 find farming both interesting and     
 important. They own{36 acres}of land, 
 10 of which they use for{crops,}and   
 the remainder for{grazing}their 250   
 sheep. They also keep poultry. The    
 Dickensons start work at{7.30am.}and  
 feed the animals on bought grain. When
 the weather is bad in winter, the day 
 starts at{6.00am.}to enable hay and   
 grain to be transported to the        
 animals.{Silage}is not grown. The     
 animals must be checked for illness,  
 then eggs are collected to be sold    
 from the farmhouse. Laurel Farm is not
 very large and has not invested in{   
{mechanical aids}beyond the usual      
 tractors. The Dickensons do not employ
 any farm hands to help with the work.
