		<title>19BIRD WATCHING.</title>
		<content>  When I was out with my group doing   
 the land cover survey on our square   
 I was very excited to see a curlew.   
 It flew over head for over ten        
 minutes and was still there when we   
 moved on.My hobbies are bird watching 
 and belonging to Cubs.The curlew was  
 the first I had seen.We think it must 
 have had a nest close by.We moved away
 so that we wouldn't disturb it.Last   
 year in a neighbouring field Ifound a 
 lapwing's nest.Both these birds like  
 to nest near water and there is a     
 stream at the bottom of the fields.   
 Most of the birds I have seen are very
 common, but last winter we did have a 
 redshank in our garden.We also see a  
 little owl quite often in the garden. 
 At school we have a bird table and we 
 feed the birds in winter, but we      
 haven't had any rare visitors.
