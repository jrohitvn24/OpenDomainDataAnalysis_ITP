		<content> This is a rural landscape and the     
 buildings are mainly related to the   
 needs of the farming community. Farm  
 buildings are built of local stone,   
 Millstone Grit and the farm houses    
 are built in the traditional Dales    
 style i.e. with stone mullions in the 
 windows and decorated doorheads (see  
 slide C). Another feature is the      
 Venetian window. The fields are all   
 surrounded by dry stone walls. The    
 area has a few typical stone-built    
 barns scattered around the fields away
 from the farmsteads, for cattle and   
 fodder during the winter. There is a  
 Millstone Grit outcrop of rock known  
 as Black Bank (see slide A).
