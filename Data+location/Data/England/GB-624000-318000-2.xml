		<content> We wrote a Questionnaire for the      
 children in the local school to answer
 about their daily lives. We found that
 quite a lot of what they thought and  
 felt was very similar to our thoughts.
 For instance most of them enjoyed     
 playing computer and video games at   
 home. They thought that their village 
 didn't have enough entertainment, they
 wanted a sports centre and a swimming 
 pool. Several children wanted a       
 cinema. They all said there was not   
 enough to do at night time. Their     
 attitude to the airbase was           
 surprising. We thought that they would
 not like the noise but most of them   
 said that they hardly ever thought    
 about it. They had mixed feelings     
 about their ambitions, some said they 
 would like to live in a big city,     
 others that they would like to live   
 abroad. (cont next page)              </content>
