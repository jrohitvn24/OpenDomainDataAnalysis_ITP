		<title>12MIDDLEWOOD WAY, ADLINGTON.</title>
		<content> David Bellamy opened the Middlewood   
 Way in May 1985. This old Macclesfield
 to Marple railway line derelict since 
 its closure in 1970, was transformed  
 by Macclesfield Borough Council using 
 professional contractors, into a      
 recreational way. The track is divided
 for use by horse-riders on one side &amp; 
 cyclists &amp; walkers on the other.A path
 at the top of the embankments enables 
 visitors to take advantage of the     
 views to east &amp; west.Cheshire         
 Conservation Trust helped plan the    
 regeneration of habitats weakened     
 during the fallow years. The limestone
 bed was lost but 18,165 shrubs, 9558  
 trees &amp; many flowers were planted to  
 join the native flora in the area.The 
 banking provides cover for warblers &amp; 
 other bird species.Small ponds and wet
 land are now the habitat of frogs,    
 newts, insects &amp; water plants.        </content>
