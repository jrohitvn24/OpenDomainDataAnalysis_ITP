		<title>04The School at St.Cleer.</title>
		<content>    The land for the school was bought 
 from the Liskeard and Caradon Railway 
 Company and the school built in 1877. 
 There were three classrooms for 160   
 children. The school cost Â£971 to     
 build, and the two houses next door   
 were bought for the master for Â£71.   
    The children paid between 1d and 3d
 a week. Every year an inspector came. 
 If the children passed his tests, they
 would go up to the next standard: if  
 they did not pass, they would stay in 
 the same class for another year.      
   The master was George Noble, and he 
 was paid Â£78 p.a. The infants teacher 
 was paid Â£40 p.a. The playground was  
 divided into two parts -the north half
 for the boys, and the south side for  
 the girls and infants.                
    The school was all-age until 1957, 
 when the older children went a new    
 secondary school at Liskeard.         </content>
