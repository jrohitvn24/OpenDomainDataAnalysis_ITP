		<content>{Hestair Dennis}is the largest single  
 employer in the area, manufacturing   
 fire engines, refuse carts, lorries   
 &amp; bus chassis.{Fire engines,}its main 
 product, take 12 weeks to complete.   
 They are sold all over the UK and the 
 Middle and Far East. Raw materials are
 British and West German. The Dennis   
 brothers began their bicycle company  
 in 1895, soon progressing to motorised
 tricycles and cars, later specialising
 in commercial vehicles. The publicity 
 surrounding Raymond's Â£1 fine for     
 speeding at 16 mph in a company car   
 launched the firm and in 1905 they    
 moved to the present 37 acre site. The
 current work force of 790, comprises  
 425 engineers, 127 shop floor workers 
 and 238 office staff. Great reductions
 in space and workers will take place  
 in 1986, when a property company      
 builds DIY hypermarkets on the site.  </content>
