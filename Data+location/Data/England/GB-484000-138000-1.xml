 The area is a quiet undulating country
 area,much of it covered by woodland.  
 Pine trees,silver birch,oak trees are 
 predominant,but holly,rhododendrun and
 beech are also found.The soil is sandy
 especially near the Devil's Jumps and 
 Frensham Pond;fern and bracken cover  
 the ground under the trees and over   
 the common,there is a wide variety of 
 wild flowers growing undisturbed.At   
 one time in June as many as 250       
 different varieties of wild flower    
 were counted. Butterflies and moths   
 also abound in great variety,while    
 birds such as yellow hammer,redwing   
 chiff-chaff,heron can be seen as well 
 as the more common ones.Foxes and deer
 are also often seen. Farmland covers  
 the second largest area of land,while 
 housing accounts for only a small     
 percentage.                           </content>
