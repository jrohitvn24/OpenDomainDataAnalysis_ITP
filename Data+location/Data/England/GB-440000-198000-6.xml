		<content>  The area has changed little because  
in 1555 Sir Thomas White, who lived in 
the manor, as the founder of St. John's
College Oxford, left his whole estate  
to them.  They have only recently      
allowed a few properties to be sold,   
because of the recent legislation on   
security of tenure.                    
  On one side of Fyfield Manor is Manor
Farm house, from where the third       
generation of the Lay family is farming
the area.  It was built in 1665 as a   
place of refuge for fellows during the 
plague.                                
  On the other side is St. Nicholas    
Church dating from pre 1086.  The      
woodwork was replaced after a bad fire 
in 1893.                               
  There is a unique memento mori in the
Golafre Chapel (1442). Beyond the organ
is the tomb (1537) of Lady Catherine   
Gordon, wife of Perkin Warbeck.        </content>
