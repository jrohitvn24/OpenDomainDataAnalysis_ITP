 Little Staughton has a{Second World   
{War Airfield}built for the            
 R.A.F.Pathfinders.The R.A.F vacated   
 it in 1957. From 1957 -1970 Brooklands
 Aviation rebuilt aeroplanes for the   
 R.A.F. Later they let the buildings to
 various small companies. The first    
 was Race Engine Services Ltd. Soon    
 many other companies came to the      
 airfield and it took on a second role 
 as an industrial estate. The Airfield 
 now has one runway. The second runway 
 and perimeter tracks have been removed
 so that a larger area of ground can be
 used for arable farming.Approximately 
 30 companies occupy the{Industrial    
{Estate.}These companies include       
 commercial vehicle                    
 bodybuilders,printers and bookbinders 
 and an aeroplane restoration company.
