		<content>  The Plumstead Library has 16,583     
 books. The library has a section of   
 adults books , a children's area, and 
 there is also a section for young     
 adults. The library is financed by the
 County Council. Pensioners do not have
 to pay fines for overdue books.       
  The library is open 30 hours a week. 
 Some of the library's rules are that  
 you must not spit and lay on the      
 floor.                                
  Two people work in the library       
 at the same time, one is Mr. Wallis.  
  The books are mainly hardbacks as    
 they last longer. The most popular    
 adult's books are written by Catherine
 Cookson. Some of the children's       
 favourite authors are Roald Dahl and  
 Enid Blyton. Children can take out    
 three books and adults four.          
  In the daytime it is often pensioners
 and mothers who use the library.      </content>
