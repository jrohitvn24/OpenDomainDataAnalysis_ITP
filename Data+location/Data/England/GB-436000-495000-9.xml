		<title>09HOUSING IN BROMPTON</title>
		<content> Brompton is built around a crossroads,
 a green and water meadow.95% of the   
 houses are built of brick &amp; 5%        
 stone.20% of the housing is modern    
 with central heating,but the rest     
 still use solid fuel;about 45% are    
 council owned.Nearly half the houses  
 are terraced,these are the oldest in  
 Brompton.They are built in the centre 
 of the village &amp; along the water      
 meadow;most are built of stone and the
 rooves are slate.The terraced houses  
 do not have front gardens.As you      
 travel away from the centre of the    
 village the housing styles            
 change.About a third of the houses are
 semi_detached,these are built of      
 brick.There are also detached houses, 
 bungalows and maisonettes.The gardens 
 are generally quite small.
