		<title>12THE VILLAGE DOCTOR</title>
		<content>   "In St.Margaret's" said Dr.Thomson  
 "people are very healthy and I seldom 
 have to send people to hospital with  
 serious illnesses." He then told us   
 that the most serious illnesses were  
 heart attacks and strokes but he only 
 had to deal with 2 to 3 cases a week. 
                                       
   "To become a doctor," said Dr.      
 Thomsom,"took 6 years of training." He
 told us that before he came to the    
 village he had worked in Dover and    
 before that he had been a medical     
 officer in the Sudan.                 
                                       
   He owns the surgery and said that   
 if he stopped being a doctor he would 
 make the surgery into a house.        
 .                                     
   Dr.Thomson said that he loved his   
 work in spite of the long hours and   
 that he would never like to change.   </content>
