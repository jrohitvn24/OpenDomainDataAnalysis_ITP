		<content> A red stone coffin lid in the Porch   
 suggests a Saxon origin for St.James' 
 Church.Until the purchase of the manor
 by Bath Priory an itinerant monk may  
 have looked after the congregation.   
 Later a resident priest was instituted
 by the Prior and Chapter of Bath.     
 From the Dissolution until the present
 Rectors have been presented by the    
 Lord of the Manor.                    
 In 1924 services were transferred to  
 St.Barnabas,Temple Cloud.
