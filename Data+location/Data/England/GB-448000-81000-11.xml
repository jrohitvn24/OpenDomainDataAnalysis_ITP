		<title>11HOME LIFE: R.S.P.C.A.HOME</title>
		<content>      The R.S.P.C.A. home in Rookley is
 at Bohemia Corner. It takes in any    
 stray animals. The warden, who runs   
 it, lives in the grounds and has 3    
 people to help him. The kennels are   
 quite spacious so that the animals    
 have room to run around. The helpers  
 have not got time to walk the dogs;   
 that is why spacious kennels are      
 important.                            
     At the home there is an orchard   
 which is used as a sound barrier      
 because people used to complain that  
 the animals were making too much      
 noise.                                
     Some of the animals are boarders  
 which means their owners are away     
 from home. If you want to buy an      
 animal a dog would cost Â£12 and a cat 
 would cost Â£5.                        
                                       
                                       </content>
