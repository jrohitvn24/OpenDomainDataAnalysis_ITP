   The area of the survey is only part 
of the large parish of Polstead,at one 
time one of the largest in Suffolk,    
covering about 4,000 acres,but,with    
the growth of nearby Boxford,the       
boundaries have been altered.          
   The broad valley of the shallow     
river Box runs from north-west to      
south-east across the survey area.     
The land around is undulating with     
small rounded hills.Good hedges        
around the small fields,strips of      
woodland and small copses give the     
impression that the area is more       
wooded than it is.The narrow sunken    
winding  lanes hide  all but  the      
immediate scene  to the  traveller .   
   Polstead is composed of several     
hamlets,such as Whitestreet green      
and Mill street .The main centre of    
population is near the village green.  </content>
