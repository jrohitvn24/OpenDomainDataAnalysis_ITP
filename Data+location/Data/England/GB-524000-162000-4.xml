 down the streets.Guides and Brownies  
 often do some country dancing so do   
 Morris Men. Fancy dress competitions  
 are held too and the Mayoress presents
 the prizes.                           
   In the school hall are verse        
 speaking and music, craft, flower     
 arranging and cake making             
 competitions.In the evening the       
 winners give a concert.Other events   
 such as drama productions and recitals
 in church form part of the festival.
