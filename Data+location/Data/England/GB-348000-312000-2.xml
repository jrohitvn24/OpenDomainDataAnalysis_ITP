		<title>02SHREWSBURY'S POLITICAL SCENE</title>
		<content> Shrewsbury's political scene,in 1985, 
 is interesting but confusing.Mr.Derek 
 Conway, the Conservative Member of    
 Parliament,was elected with a majority
 of over{8,000 votes}in 1983 but had   
 fewer votes than the total cast for   
 his two opponents,the Liberal Alliance
 candidate,who came second,and the     
 Labour candidate who was bottom of the
 poll.This brings claims from          
 supporters of the other parties that  
 Mr.Conway is not the choice of the    
 majority of the people he represents. 
 But this is our electoral system-and  
 it does work in reverse elsewhere.    
 Locally the scene is equally          
 confusing.Although the{Conservatives  
 have most members on Shrewsbury and   
 Atcham Borough Council,their number is
 equalled by{Labour}and{Liberal        
 councillors.Shrewsbury's most famous  
 Member of Parliament was{Disraeli.    </content>
