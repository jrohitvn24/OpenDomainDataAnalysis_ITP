		<title>06SARAH'S DAY IN SCHOOL</title>
		<content>  When everyone is in school the bell  
 rings at 9 o'clock. We have register  
 and assembly. We get out our reading  
 books and read, then we do Maths.     
  Now it is playtime, we get our tuck  
 and go out into the playground.I like 
 to play crossroads and chase. Next    
 it's bell.We come in and sit down. Now
 we sometimes write a story.           
  It is lunch time.We go up to the     
 toilets and wash our hands.Now we     
 come back into the classroom and eat  
 our lunch. I have sandwiches. We have 
 our playtime.                         
  Now we have a story and do a project 
 until it is playtime. After play we   
 have Mrs Stout (another teacher) and  
 Mrs Hayes teaches the infants. We have
 music.School finishes at three        
 o'clock.Then I go home and play.
