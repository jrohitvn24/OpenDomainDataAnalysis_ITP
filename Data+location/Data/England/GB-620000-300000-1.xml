 In a landscape of undulating arable   
 farmland, dotted with small areas of  
 woodland and isolated trees,lie the   
 three main settlements of Swardeston, 
 Swainsthorpe, Stoke Holy Cross,       
 where development is still taking     
 place and the small hamlet of Dunston.
                                       
 A few people only work in the villages
 on the farms or in the shops. The vast
 majority find employment in the nearby
 city of Norwich, which is five to     
 eight miles distant.                  
                                       
 Life is quiet, and social problems are
 few, most of the population being     
 employed and in reasonably comfortable
 situations.                           
                                       
 Facilities and amenities are adequate.</content>
