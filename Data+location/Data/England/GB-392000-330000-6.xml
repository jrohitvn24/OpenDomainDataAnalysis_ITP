There is very little scope for leisure 
activities in this area. Hunting,      
shooting and fishing are available     
during the season.                     
                                       
The Trent and Mersey Canal provides    
fishing and canal cruising. This       
creates a small amount of tourist      
trade at the Greyhound Public House.   
Fishing is confined to a pool, which   
is leased to a factory Angling Club,   
and to the towpath of the canal under  
licence.                               
                                       
The North Staffs. Hunt meet and ride   
over some of the fields, and as most   
of the land belongs to one landlord,   
the pheasant shoot is leased out       
privately.
