		<title>13GAMES AT FAIR OAK SCHOOL</title>
		<content>    As well as netball, football and   
 rounders we have some special games{  
{   Instant Cricket}is played with a   
 small wooden bat, a waste paper bin   
 and a rounders post. The basket is the
 wicket and you have to run to the post
 and back to score a run. The bowler   
 throws the ball and tries to get the  
 ball in the basket. If he hits the    
 basket you are out; if he gets the    
 ball in the basket three times the    
 whole side is out and you change      
 round. Only the bowler can hit the    
 wicket.                               
    {Padder Tennis.}This is like       
 ordinary tennis except that the court 
 is smaller, the net is lower and the  
 bats are like big table tennis bats.  
   { Potted Sports.}We have all kinds  
 of activities set up-running,jumping, 
 balancing,throwing etc. Everyone does 
 as many as they can in a set time.    </content>
