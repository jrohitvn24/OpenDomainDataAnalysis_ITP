		<title>18THE RIVER DOUGLAS</title>
		<content>  The{River Douglas}rises on{Rivington 
{Moor}to the east of Wigan and flows   
 roughly westwards, through the town   
 centre, to enter the{Irish Sea}north  
 of Southport. It was a clean river    
 providing salmon fishing up to 150    
 years ago. Since the{Industrial       
{Revolution}it has become very{polluted
 from chemicals discharged by paper and
 textile works along its course. Until 
 recently it might have been a         
 different colour each day from dye.   
  The NW Water Authority finished      
 building a large new sewer in the late
 1970's and the river's condition has  
{improved}since. Fish now live in it   
 again and it is no longer a dangerous 
 eyesore. Wiganers are proud of it once
 more and numerous{conservation}schemes
 are active. These involve landscaping 
 of the valley sides and planting trees
 especially in the Bottling Wood area. </content>
