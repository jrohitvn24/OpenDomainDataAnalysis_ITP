		<content> This block covers previous farming    
 land which is being swallowed up by   
 the need for space on which to build  
 residential and industrial estates.   
 It is an example of urban extension,  
 in thiscase,south from Middlesbrough/ 
 Thornaby.Also included is the junction
 of the new roadways acting as bypasses
 to connect the traffic flowing E/W and
 N/S.The area still retains some farm  
 land,villages and settlements in the  
 south.This would appear to be         
 temporary as the rate of building is  
 accelerating in the residential       
 section.The new housing caters,mainly 
 for private homes,the council owned   
 houses being nearer the town centre.  
 The central part has been allocated as
 land for industrial use but is,       
 apparently, failing to attract much   
 new industry.This block is a mix of   
 farms,housing,industry and villages.  </content>
