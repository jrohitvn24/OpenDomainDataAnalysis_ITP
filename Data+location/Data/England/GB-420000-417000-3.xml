		<content> Mirfield lies in the valley floor and 
 lower valley side of the River Calder.
 The valley floor is about 1/2 km wide.
 It is followed by the railway between 
 Huddersfield and Leeds and the A644 to
 Dewsbury. Much of the older industry  
 has been developed along the river and
 canal so that it is now polluted (to  
 some extent).The main shopping area   
 has a linear form along the A644 road 
 to the north of the river.The housing 
 on the north side is largely brick    
 built semi-detached and detached.There
 are some small older terrace houses in
 the valley floor, built for the       
 factory workers in the past. South of 
 the river the steep valley sides have 
 much woodland.There are also some     
 farms and a golf course. Some larger  
 houses lie in their own grounds and   
 there are two small village           
 settlements,Whitley and Briestfield.  </content>
