		<title>11Geography of Southam Area</title>
		<content>  There are two major settlement areas;
 the market town of Southam and the    
 village of Stockton. Two rivers, the  
 Stowe and the Itchen drain the land   
 towards Leamington Spa, eventually    
 flowing into the River Avon.          
  Most of the land is used for arable  
 farming. The main crops are wheat and 
 barley. Potatoes, onions, carrots and 
 oil seed rape are also grown. Some    
 fields bordering rivers or streams are
 used as pasture.                      
  Tractors are used to pull the farm   
 machinery including muck spreaders,   
 ploughs, harrows and seed drills.     
 Combine harvesters are used to collect
 the cereal crops.                     
  A typical farm on the edge of Southam
 had 226 acres: ley grass 114 acres,   
 wheat 59 acres, barley 43 acres and   
 potatoes 10 acres.
