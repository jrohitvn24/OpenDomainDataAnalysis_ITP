		<title>16    MOTOR TRANSPORT</title>
		<content>  In 1985 the motor car was the most   
important mode of transport for the    
population.In undertaking a traffic    
flow survey,the results obtained not   
only showed the volume of cars in usage
but gave an insight into the affluence 
of today's society.                    
  The dependance upon the car is       
reflected in the fact that the majority
of vehicles were recent models.In 1985,
cars are dated by the registration     
plate which is unique to each vehicle  
and from this it is possible to obtain 
data.The survey revealed that between  
13.00 and 14.45 hrs,18% of cars were   
1984/85 registered.This compared with  
9% which were 1978/79 registered and   
only 7% were registered as being older 
than 1974/75.                          
  The most popular car was the         
hatchback.
