		<title>15WILDLIFE IN REDDISH VALE</title>
		<content> When you arrive at{Reddish Vale}you   
 can have a look in the{Reddish Vale   
{visitor centre.}There you can see some
 skulls from real{badgers}that have    
 died but you are not likely to find   
 any badgers in{Reddish Vale}because   
 they are very rare. You can ask{Dave  
{Cannon}the{warden}some questions on   
{wildlife.                             
{ Dave}will tell you about all the     
 rabbits that burrow under the twigs   
 that the wardens have cut from the    
 trees. In the future there will be    
 some changes in{Reddish Vale}because  
 in the farm there is a family of      
 hamsters breeding rapidly and they are
 all escaping and running off into the 
 woods.These pet hampsters will become 
 wild in the future and live and breed 
 in the{Vale.}
