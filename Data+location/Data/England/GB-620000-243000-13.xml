I  live  in  Penshurst  Road,  Ipswich.
In my  area  there is a local  shopping
centre and  an  estate  of  about  2000
houses.   There  are about 100 trees in
my road, 3 bus stops and mostly one car
per house.  There  is a  primary school
nearby, (Broke Hall).  Most houses have
bay windows and porch doors.  There are
no houses with  coal  fires.  They  all
have  central  heating  and electric or
gas  fires   because  they  are  modern
houses, less  than  20  years old.  The
shops  in  my  area  are  a  newsagent,
baker, dry  cleaner,  hairdresser, fish
and chips,  garden  centre  and  a food
supermarket.    It is a nice  place  to
live  because  the  people are friendly
and the  facilities are good.   The bus
stops  are  close  to  the  houses  and
provide  regular transport into and out
of Ipswich.                            </content>
