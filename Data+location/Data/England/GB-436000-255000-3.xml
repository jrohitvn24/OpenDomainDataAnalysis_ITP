		<content> Bishops Itchington is a very old      
 village.  It was included in the first
{Domesday Book}which was put together  
 in 1O86.  When the first Domesday Book
 was made, our village was called{     
{Icetone}but the name has changed over 
 the years to{Uchenton Episcopi}then to
{Bisshopesychengton.}It changed to{    
{Fishers Itchington}and finally to{    
{Bishops Itchington.}(The village was  
 called other names as well.)  We don't
 know exactly how old the village is   
 but we do know that the population of 
 the village increased dramatically    
 when the{Blue Circle Cement Works}at  
 Harbury opened.  Nowadays the works   
 are at the point of closing down.  At 
 present they are only used for        
 processing the cement mined elsewhere.
 At the beginning of the century a lot 
 of people moved to the village. Now   
 the population is around two thousand.</content>
