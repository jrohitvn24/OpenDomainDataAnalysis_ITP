		<content> Within the area, public Services      
 really are poor.  There art only two  
 telephone boxes for general use and   
 there is therefore a dependence upon  
 personal telephones.  Harley is served
 by a daily bus service connecting Much
 Wenlock and Shrewsbury.               
   There are no railways in the area,  
 the nearest station being Shrewsbury, 
 a fair distance away.  Milk is not    
 delivered until 2.00 p.m..  The roads 
 are all old ones and are narrow with  
 room for only one way traffic except  
 in the villages.  Except in village   
 areas, road surfaces are poor but this
 is a feature generally associated with
 Shropshire at this time.  It is a     
 quiet area with just a few lorries    
 serving farms.  Peaple have to be self
 sufficient with private cars and      
 telephones.                           
                                       </content>
