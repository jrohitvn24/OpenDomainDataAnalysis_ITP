		<title>06 HEANOR MARKET</title>
		<content> Heanor market place is an open space  
 in the centre of the town, overlooked 
 by the Church with its clock and      
 surrounded by shops and bus stops.    
 From Mondays to Thursdays this area is
 used for car parking, a service which 
 is not appreciated by pedestrians. On 
 the Fridays and Saturdays the area is 
 filled with stalls which include      
 grocery, clothing, fancy goods and the
 most popular, the greengrocery. Prices
 are cheaper than the shops and the    
 stall holder's profits are better on  
 Fridays. Throughout the year the      
 Market Place has other uses which     
 include being the Fairground          
 twice-a-year, housing the Victorian   
 Market every May Day, the profits from
 this going to the Church Rebuilding   
 Fund and the Town's Christmas tree is 
 placed in the centre in December ready
 for the Carol singing services.       </content>
