		<title>09A 10 Year Old Boy's Day</title>
		<content>     A typical day in my life is a     
 school day. I get up at 7.30am, have a
 wash, brush my teeth and have my      
 breakfast.                            
     I go to school at 8.40am and play 
 football with my class on our field.  
 When the bell rings we go into the    
 classroom.On Wednesdays we            
 have an assembly to show work from    
 other classes. After assembly we have 
 play time for twenty minutes and then 
 we work again until lunch.            
     Sometimes I do language until our 
 assembly and after play I do the rest 
 of my language work until lunch time. 
 After lunch I start on my maths until 
 we tidy up at about 2.40pm for our    
 story. We finish at 3.00pm.           
     I have my tea at about 5.40pm. I  
 have a bath and watch TV and go to bed
 at about 9.30pm.
