		<content>   There is no school or playgroup     
 within the area under examination,    
 all school children being bussed into 
 nearby schools since the village      
 school became too small to be         
 economically viable. Of the 50 plus   
 children of school age, the pupils of 
 primary school age are collected by   
 bus to{Great Witley Church of England 
{Primary School}, which is a           
 well-established church school five   
 miles distant, with 5 teachers and    
 about 120 pupils under 11 in a country
 setting. The other primary option     
 offered is at{Clifton Primary School},
 but if this smaller school is         
 chosen (60 pupils) the County does    
 not provide free transport. About 15  
 local children attend{independent     
{schools}mainly in Worcester and       
 Kidderminster, while 7 of this number 
 board.                                </content>
