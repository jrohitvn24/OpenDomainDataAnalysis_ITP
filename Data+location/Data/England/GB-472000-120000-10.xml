		<title>10THE VILLAGE OF BURITON</title>
		<content>{Landscape and Buildings:}The village  
 is basically the same as it was in the
 17th Century with ribbon development  
 along the roads radiating from the    
 Church, Manor House and Pond.  Many of
 the old buildings remain and are built
 of white malmstone with brick         
 dressing.  A large number of buildings
 are on the Statutory and Supplementary
 lists of Special Architectural        
 Historic Interest.  The oldest        
 building is St Mary's Church which has
 a 12th Century nave and 13th Century  
 chancel.  Parts of the old Rectory are
 14th Century but the building has been
 altered.  The Manor House, adjacent to
 the church, has parts dating from the 
 16th Century. These buildings plus the
 houses along the High Street, Bones   
 Lane and North Lane form a            
 'Conservation' Area.
