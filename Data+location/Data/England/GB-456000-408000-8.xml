		<content>  The saddle they use mostly is the    
 general purpose one.The general       
 purpose saddle is for the every day   
 use.They use{Numners}which are a type 
 of saddle blanket in the shape of a   
 saddle.They stop the back of the horse
 getting sore from the saddle.If you   
 haven't got a{numner}you should have a
 blanket.They also use the jumping     
 saddle.The jumping saddle is a saddle 
 with a deep seat.This saddle is       
 designed to keep the rider in a       
 forward position for jumping.One horse
 has a{kimblewick}bit because it is    
 frisky.The{kimblewick}bit is strong   
 on the mouth.The rest have snaffle    
 bits because these are soft on the    
 mouth.They have three feeds a day.They
 feed on pony nuts,flake maze,broad    
 bran,oats and vitamin oats.Oats make  
 the pony or horse silly.
