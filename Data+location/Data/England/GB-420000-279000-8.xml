		<content> On the 25th December it was{Christmas}
 Day. I got up at 2.30 in the morning  
 because my brother woke me up because 
 he was excited. We both went into my  
 mum's room and my mum said, "It's only
 2:30 in the morning!" Anyway we all   
 got up and opened them.I got the most 
 of course, I always do. We got a      
 computer and a TV and more. All day   
 we played with the computer and ate   
 all of our sweets and Turkey etc.     
 After dinner we all had a game of     
 Downfall and mum had a go on the      
 computer and didn't do very well at   
 all. Then we all had a rest and       
 watched TV. There were some good      
 programmes on and some not so good.   
 Then we went to bed.                  
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
