		<content> Every two years a carnival is held in 
 Cawthorne.First,all the parents meet  
 and decide on the theme.It is         
 television programmes this year.Each  
 street dresses the children in        
 costumes to match the float.Wood,wire 
 and paint is bought and building      
 begins.The Friday before the          
 carnival,the lorries arrive in the    
 village.Everyone is busy hammering the
 scenes on the float and finishing the 
 painting.The children start getting   
 excited.At 1.30p.m. on Saturday,all   
 the floats line up.The bands play and 
 the floats,carrying the children,drive
 to the Village Green,where the judging
 takes place,then on to the field      
 behind the Village Hall.There we have 
 games and side shows.Cristopher
