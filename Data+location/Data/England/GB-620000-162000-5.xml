		<content> The house was  built in 1580.Since    
 1908 the farm has belonged to the     
 Fuller family.Mr Peter Fuller + his   
 brother James now run the farm and    
 employ Mr Hopkins (cowman) and Mr     
 Apps.                                 
 The farm has 440 acres of land.They   
 grow wheat(500 tons a year),peas,beans
 + grass seed.There are 15 fields for  
 grazing.These are for the dairy herd  
 of 103 British Friesian cows.         
 In a year 118 calves are born and 38  
 of these are sold.The cows eat 390    
 tons of cattle food a year.           
 Milking starts at 5.30 am and 3pm and 
 takes 2 1\  hours.In winter when      
 the cows are kept under cover a       
 computer controls their food ration.  
 Mr Fuller has 6 tractors and a New    
 Holland combine.At harvest time he    
 uses 115 gallons of diesel per week.
