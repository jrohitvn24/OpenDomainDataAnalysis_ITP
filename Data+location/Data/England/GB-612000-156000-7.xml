		<title>07Education in Canterbury (2)</title>
		<content>   As it takes many pupils from outside
 Canterbury, the Catholic Church       
 implemented their comprehensive plans.
   Every child of{school}age is to be  
 examined at intervals by a school     
 doctor, including dental inspections. 
   A mid-day{meal}is provided at       
 school costing 60p. Many children,    
 however, bring their own packed lunch.
   Children with special needs are     
 catered for and, where possible,      
 educated in normal schools with the   
 help of a{welfare}assistant.          
   There are opportunities for further 
 education at the{College}of           
 Technology, College of Art, and Christ
 Church Training College.              
   The King's School, the oldest school
 in England, was established c.598. It 
 is a public school taking some 700    
 pupils.
