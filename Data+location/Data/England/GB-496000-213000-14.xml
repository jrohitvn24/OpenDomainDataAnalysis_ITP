		<title>14LITTLE GADDESDEN C.E.CHURCH</title>
		<content>   The Church of St. Peter and St. Paul
 stands on the outskirts of our present
 village, at the end of a long lane    
 where the centre of the village used  
 to be up until the Black Death, when  
 only the church was left standing.    
   The 13th Century tower is the oldest
 part of the church and the bellringers
 practise there every Tuesday evening  
 (there are 7 bells).                  
   The activities of the church are St.
 Peter and St. Pauls People who meet   
 every Friday to help raise money for  
 church funds.  The Sunday School meet 
 in the School Hall or the Vestry at   
 9.30 am to sing and pray.             
   Services are held every Holy Day and
 Sunday at 8 am, 9.30 am and 6.30 pm.  
 The church is very well looked after  
 and decorated with pretty flowers     
 which are nicely arranged.  The Church
 yards are also maintained beautifully.</content>
