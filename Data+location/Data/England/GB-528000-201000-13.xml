		<title>13A WALK IN CUFFLEY.</title>
		<content> We left school and walked along to the
 public footpath. the path was quite   
 muddy so we wore boots. Beside the    
 stream stinging nettles thrive so we  
 had to be careful. Walking on we saw  
 the hawthorn bush with its tiny white 
 flowers. Now we came to an iron gate  
 with a gap at the side for people to  
 walk through.By the gap was a young   
 hazel tree with new leaves.Through the
 gap by the gate we saw fields of      
 winter wheat. There was a grass strip 
 ahead of us to walk on.As well as the 
 crop,many small flowers or weeds grow 
 dead nettles with their small pink    
 flowers,yellow dandelions,and cat's   
 eyes-small blue flowers really known  
 as speedwell.We saw a muntjac deer and
 the yellow celandine. By the stream is
 a pussy willow,here we stood to view  
 the viaduct(a local landmark) and the 
 neighbouring village of Northaw.      </content>
