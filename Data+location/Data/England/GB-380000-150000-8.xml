		<content>  Beckington  affords  many fine listed
 buildings  some  dating  back  to  the
 twelfth  century  connected  with  the
 church and  others  connected with the
 wool trade.                           
  Bechington Abbey was built in 1169 as
 a  Hospice and is now divided into two
 residences. One part called The Grange
 is now a cookery school.              
  Abbey  House in Goose St. was used by
 pilgrims  and  there is  a row of alms
 houses nearby.                        
  Beckington  has   associations   with
 Henry  VIII and  his wives.  Seymour's
 Court is   where  Jane  Seymour lived.
  The   Wool  Hall is  now  used  as  a
 recording studio for  Tears  for Fears
 and other pop groups.                 
  Many  of  the  weavers cottages still
 remain. There are two small  privately
 owned estates, two council estates and
 old peoples flats and bungalows.      </content>
