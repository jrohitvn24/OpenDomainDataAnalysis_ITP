		<title>13Woolley Service Station</title>
		<content> Woolley Edge Service Station is on the
 M1 near Wakefield.There are really two
 service stations, one at each side of 
 the motorway.We arrived at the        
 southbound station and waited in the  
 hall for the shift manager, whose name
 was Katherine Watson.We started to ask
 her questions.The service station has 
 been open for 16 years.Each day it    
 opens from 7.00 a.m.to 10.30 p.m. They
 have about 400 customers a day.I was  
 suprised and looked around.There      
 certainly were quite a few people     
 there.Sometimes famous people call in 
 like Geoff Boycott and Freddie Starr. 
 Some were business men, some lorry    
 drivers, and some holiday makers.There
 are 81 people working in the service  
 station.
