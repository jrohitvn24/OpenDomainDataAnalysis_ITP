		<title>18SEESWOOD POOL</title>
		<content>  If you went to Seeswood Pool you     
 would be sure to see birds upon the   
 water,plus geese coming and going.If  
 you walked along the banks you would  
 see the anglers fishing.You would see 
 the farm and the cows too.If you went 
 at about 6 o'clock you would see the  
 fish jumping to catch flies and water 
 spiders too.I wouldn't go when it's   
 raining heavily because the pool rises
 quickly.If you walk in the fields     
 around the pool then take care not to 
 step into a cow pat.There are stiles  
 to take you,from one field to         
 another,but it would take you a while 
 to get over them because at each side 
 of the stile there is a lot of mud.If 
 you put your foot in the mud your shoe
 could possibly come off.Seeswood Pool 
 is an interesting place to go for a   
 walk,or for fishing, bird watching,or 
 simply for a picnic.                  </content>
