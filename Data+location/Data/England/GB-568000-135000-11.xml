		<content>   Finchcocks was built for Edward     
Bathurst, whose family lived there for 
most of the 18th century, in 1725 and  
is noted for its outstanding brickwork.
It is in parkland surrounded by        
hopgardens.                            
   When the Legat School of Ballet     
moved to Mark Cross, in 1970, Richard  
Burnett, a pianist, specialising in    
Fortepiano playing, bought it.         
   It now houses his remarkable        
collection of historical keyboard      
instruments most of which are in       
playing condition.                     
   Finchcocks is now a musical centre  
of international repute and many       
activities take place there like       
concerts, open days, musical tours and 
other events. The gardens are being    
restored and will also be opened to the
public.
