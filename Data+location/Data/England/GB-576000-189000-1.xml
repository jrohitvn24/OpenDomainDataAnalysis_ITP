 The area is situated to the north of  
 Thundersley, and the west of Rayleigh.
 It is a little over 50% mixed arable  
{farming.}Its southern 1km * 4km strip 
 is a mixture of farmland,{housing,    
{industrial estate,}and{open spaces.}  
 The north east corner comprises       
 housing development along the A129 to 
 the east of Rayleigh railway station. 
                                       
 We have decided to call the area New  
 Thundersley as this is the largest    
 urban development in the area.        
                                       
 The area is crossed  north - south by 
 the A130, and from east - west by the 
 A127. These roads intersect in the    
 centre of the area. In the north of   
 the area lies the Liverpool St. rail  
 line and the National Grid Electrical 
 Distribution Station.                 </content>
