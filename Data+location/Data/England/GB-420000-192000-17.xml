		<title>17Highworth Family Life.</title>
		<content> The population of Highworth is around 
 10,000. We questionned 30 adults in   
 the High Street and many children in  
 our school. The answers we got told us
 of peoples' lives in Highworth. Most  
 people get up between 7am and 8am and 
 do not have a cooked breakfast. Many  
 sporting activities occur at weekends;
 most people who play sport enjoy      
 swimming especially. The average      
 person watches between 4 and 5 hours  
 of television a day at the weekend.   
 Children watch the most by far. Most  
 adults go to bed at around 11.30pm,   
 but children end their day at 9.30pm.
