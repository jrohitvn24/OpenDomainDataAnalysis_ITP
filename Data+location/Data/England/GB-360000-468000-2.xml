		<title>02RURAL FARMING - GENERAL</title>
		<content> Farming in this area is a mixture of  
 hill farming involving mainly sheep   
 and "hill" or suckler cows which can  
 live on the poor grazing land of      
 higher ground, and lowland farming by 
 dairy farmers. Depending on the       
 quality of the land, the average cost 
 per acre is approximately Â£1800-Â£2000 
 and the average farmer, possesses 80  
 cows per 100 acres of lowland. The    
 main problem which farmers encounter  
 daily is illness in stock, but the    
 weather also hampers haytime and      
 affects crops and milk yield. A health
 inspector visits the farm regularly.  
 Farmers like to administer their own  
 drugs and only call the vet in severe 
 cases. Every ten years a safety       
 inspector makes extensive checks.     
 There is no restriction upon the use  
 of fertilisers and lime and slag are  
 widely used.                          </content>
