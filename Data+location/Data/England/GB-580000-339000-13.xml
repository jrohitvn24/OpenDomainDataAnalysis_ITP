		<title>13HOUSING IN BURNHAM MARKET 2</title>
		<content>   {Private Housing}                   
                                       
    Burnham market is a very popular   
 holiday village, and twelve of the    
 privately owned houses and cottages in
 this survey area are holiday homes.   
 Many of the other private dwellings   
 are owned by people who have moved to 
 this area to retire.                  
    Although few of the houses in this 
 survey area date from before the last 
 war, the use of traditional building  
 materials is encouraged. Several small
 housing estates have been built in the
 vilage in the past decade, and it is  
 in the part of Burnham Market covered 
 by this survey that most new building 
 is taking place. Kestrel Close, the   
 most recent development, consists of  
 24 bungalows constructed in a mixture 
 of traditional flint and brick.
