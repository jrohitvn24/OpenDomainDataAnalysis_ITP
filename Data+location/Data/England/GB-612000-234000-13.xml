		<title>13One Saturday in Stutton</title>
		<content> When I got up I went downstairs and   
 had my breakfast and then I got       
 dressed. Later on in the morning I    
 telephoned Dan to see if I could play 
 with him and I could. When I got to   
 Dan's garden. Dan, Robert, John and   
 Andreas had disappeared. I looked     
 behind a hedge and saw them eating    
 blackberries so I ran round and joined
 them. Then we decided to play 'Army'  
 so we each had a toy gun. We had teams
 of three and two people. John's team  
 went and hid. We counted to 500 and   
 then went to look for them. We found  
 them alright, well, they found us and 
 shot us! Then I had to go home for    
 dinner. In the afternoon we went      
 shopping in Ipswich and then went     
 swimming at Crown Pools. In the       
 evening I watched television until I  
 went to bed at 9pm.
