		<title>10HOUSING IN CURY/GUNWALLOE</title>
		<content>      There is a low density of housing
 in the Gunwallow/Cury area. It        
 consists mainly of scattered farm     
 houses,cottages, bungalows,estates    
 and small local council estates. The  
 latter including some individual      
 terraced bungalows for old people.    
 There is a rich mixture of old        
 thatched attractive cottages full of  
 character, some of which have been    
 fully modernised and well designed    
 modern bungalows, which are cleverly  
 intermingled with the former.The      
 villages are mainly of linear         
 development with some infilling in the
 village of Cury. There are no real    
 village centres with such linear      
 development,though the shops in       
 Berepper act as a central point in    
 that area.
