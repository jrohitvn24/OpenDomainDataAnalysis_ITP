		<content> to talk about Christian Faith         
 and issues affecting them as they get 
 ready to leave school. There are      
 Guides and Brownies, Scouts and Cubs. 
 There is Mustard Seed, a singing      
 Group, and for adults 'Man to Man'.   
 There are House groups and three      
 different groups for women. On        
 Saturday, the church invites people to
 drop in for coffee, and chat about    
 faith and any problems they have. The 
 Whit Walks originally started to get  
 people to come out of the church, into
 the street, and share their faith with
 otjers. It is a very long tradition in
 Lancashire. From this basis a sort of 
 Carnival attitude developed, with a   
 big fair in the afternoon. Everyone   
 used to buy new clothes, and even now,
 coins are often given to those taking 
 part in the Walks.Originally to pay   
 for clothes now for Church or charity)</content>
