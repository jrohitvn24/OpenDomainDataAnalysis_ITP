		<content> SHEEP                                 
 On our farm we have Cheviot and Hamp  
shire Down sheep.The mother sheep are  
called ewes.The father sheep are called
rams or tups.Sheep are dipped once a   
year to prevent illness.In summer the  
sheep are sheared. The sheep have      
lambs in early Spring.The man who      
looks after the sheep is called a      
shepherd.He carries a kind of stick    
shaped with a hook at one end, it is   
called a crook.The shepherd uses his   
crook to catch the sheep and the       
lambs.The shepherd uses dogs to help   
him,they work to whistles.Sheep live   
in sheds in the winter and the fields  
in the summer.
