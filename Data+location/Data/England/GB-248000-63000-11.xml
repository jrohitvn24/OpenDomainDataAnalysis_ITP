		<title>11Roborough Down (1).</title>
		<content>  Roborough Down is a small part of the
 365 sq.miles that is the Dartmoor     
 National Park.A Dartmoor ranger,an    
 R.S.P.C.A. inspector and 'Roborough   
 Commoners' meet once amonth to dicuss 
 the use of the Down. It is an enclosed
 common of some 2000 acres covered with
 gorse, bracken, heather and grass. It 
 is grazed by ponies and sheep but by  
 very few cattle. They all help to     
 maintain the land, providing natural  
 fertiliser and keeping herbage down.  
 During the winter farmers provide     
 fodder for cattle from which the other
 animals will also benefit. Due to the 
 decline in the number of cattle the   
 ponies have also declined. All animals
 are owned by six farmers whose farms  
 border the common and who thus have   
 'Commoners Rights' to graze animals on
 the common that is Roborough Down.
