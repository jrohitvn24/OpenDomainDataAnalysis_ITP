		<title>07Farms North East of Ogbourne</title>
		<content> There are five farms in the area north
 east of the village of Ogbourne St    
 George. They are big farms, the       
 biggest one is at Snap and it has 1500
 acres of corn and barley as well as   
 some more acres of grass.             
 Farming is the main industry in our   
 area, the main crops are barley, corn 
 and some wheat. The farms also have   
 dairy and beef cattle and some sheep. 
 Our dads work on the farm. Their work 
 is tractor driving milking and all the
 odd jobs that have got to be done.    
 Today one dad's chasing rats out of   
 the corn shed to get it ready for the 
 harvest, another is fixing the fences 
 that keep the cattle in.              
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
