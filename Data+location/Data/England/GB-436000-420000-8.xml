		<title>08SHARLSTON VILLAGE</title>
		<content> Sharlston is about 120 years old,it   
 has a methodist chapel dated 1868.The 
 village outskirts are fields          
 containing crops. The houses there are
 mainly terraced, one terrace called   
 Long Row has 46 houses joined together
 continuously. It is the longest row   
 ofterraced houses in  britain. In 120 
 years the village has changed very    
 little, although the roads are now    
 tarmac instead of dirt.The houses now 
 have toilets inside them instead of   
 them being outside.They also have     
 bathrooms, in the past they bathed in 
 a tin bath in front of the fire.Old   
 cooking-ranges have been removed and  
 replaced by coalfires and electric    
 cookers.Sharlston has a friendly      
 atmosphere.Many people meet socially  
 in the "kibble"or working mens club.  
 It's residents think it's the best pit
 village in Yorkshire.                 </content>
