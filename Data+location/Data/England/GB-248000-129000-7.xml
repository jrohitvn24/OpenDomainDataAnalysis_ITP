 I wake up as my brother is leaving for
 his paper round. Then I go back to    
 sleep. My father wakes me up at seven 
 thirty with a cup of tea. I get up and
 let the cat out! I have breakfast, get
 my bag ready for school, and let the  
 cat in again! I walk to school with my
 friend. School begins at 9 o'clock.   
 After school finishes at three thirty 
 we walk home. We have a biscuit then  
 watch television while we have our    
 tea. If the weather is nice I play on 
 the beach with my friends. If it's bad
 I like to play board games. At 8.30 we
 have supper, I watch television for a 
 while then go to bed and read before I
 go to sleep.                          
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
