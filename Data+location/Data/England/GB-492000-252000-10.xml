		<title>10Buildings, Turvey</title>
		<content> Much of the village between the       
 bridgeand Turvey Abbeyhas been        
 designated a conservation areaand     
 contains many listed buildings        
 (protected from demolition or         
 alteration which would spoil their    
 character). The limestone buildings   
 were built in 18th and 19th           
 centurieswhen the Higgins family      
 rebuilt run down cottages on the      
 public way. Many have interesting     
 gable ends and barge boards and tall  
 brick chimney stacks. One of the      
 finest buildings is the Church of All 
 Saints, dating back to AD 981. Last   
 enlarged in 1856 with the addition of 
 the chancel, sanctuary and choir      
 stalls. Turvey Abbey is Jacobean and a
 listed building. A statue of Jonah and
 his wife stand on an island in front  
 of the Mill. There was a railway      
 station up until 1962.                </content>
