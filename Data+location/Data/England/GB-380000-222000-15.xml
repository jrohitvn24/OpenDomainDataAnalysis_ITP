		<content>CROFT FARM                             
 Mr Morris has 42 acres of fruit trees 
and also keeps pigs on 12 fields of    
grassland near Hartpury. He grows plums
for sale locally and apples for a cider
company and for a mincemeat factory.   
OVERTON FARM                           
 This is a mixed arable and beef farm  
owned by Mr Bubb. It covers 220 acres  
of sloping land next to the A417. His  
cattle are Herefords, worth 150 pounds 
when 1 week old and 500 pounds at 12   
months. Last year's wheat crop was sold
to the EEC and stored in a hangar at   
Staverton Airport because of a surplus.
CHARGY HILL FARM                       
 The owner, Mrs Williams, leases most  
of her 95 acre farm to tenants who put 
beef cattle on it because it is high   
and dry land. It is mostly rough graz- 
ing, with one small orchard.
