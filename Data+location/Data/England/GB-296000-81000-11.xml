		<title>11NEWS IN EXMOUTH</title>
		<content>   The {local}news paper report on all 
 the current events in the area such as
 fetes,carnivals,weddings,council      
 meetings and emergencies.             
   The major news topics at the moment 
 are the new swimming pool and the 325 
 people that have died in the aeroplane
 crash off the coast of Ireland.       
   A new holiday brochure is out and   
 they are looking for a pretty girl to 
 go on the front cover.                
   The newspaper make most of their    
 money by selling advertisng space.    
 A whole page of advertsements would   
 cost Â£2.50. If someone wanted to sell 
 something they would have to pay 10p  
 per word. That is why people don't put
 very big{advertisements}in the papers.
 The publishers sell the papers to the 
 news agents for 9p but the news agents
 sell them for 12p so they make 3p     
 profit.                               </content>
