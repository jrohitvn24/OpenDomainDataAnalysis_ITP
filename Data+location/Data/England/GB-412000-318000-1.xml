		<title>01YOXALL VILLAGE</title>
		<content> The centre of our area of study is the
 village of Yoxall. The name having    
 been derived from Llaceshall. Facing  
 the wooded height of Cannock Chase    
 across the Vale of Trent,it lies on   
 the diminutive River Swarbourn near   
 its junction with the Trent. A large  
 village,it sits astride the main road 
 from Lichfield to Ashbourne,busy with 
 visitors to the Peak District on      
 Summer week-ends.{See acknowledgements
{below.}The main building material is  
 locally made bricks. Isolated timbered
 buildings survive eg _ Thimble Hall   
 and a cottage opposite Moat House. The
 main street twists and turns gently   
 uphill giving many changing vistas. At
 an acute dog leg turning is the centre
 of the village with ancient cottages, 
 Parish Church and pub. Narrow streets 
 and lanes lead off into open country.
