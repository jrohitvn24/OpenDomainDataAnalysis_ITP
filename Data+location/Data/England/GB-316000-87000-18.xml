		<title>18MR LAYZELL'S LIFE. PART 1.</title>
		<content> I was born in Branscombe in 1897 at   
 Cotte Cottages which have now been    
 knocked down.                         
 I went to school at Branscombe, and   
 was 14 years old when I left. The     
 school has altered a great deal since 
 I went there, when I was there,there  
 was 120 children in the school.       
 I enjoyed working in the forge, there 
 was mainly farm horses to shoe, and a 
 few donkeys.I could shoe about six    
 Heavy Cart Horses a day this is taking
 into account that all horse shoes were
 then hand made, the amount of iron    
 used for each shoe on a Cart Horse was
 43cm by 3cm wide and 1cm thick, on the
 back they were about 1 and a half     
 thick.The cost for a set of horse     
 shoes was 2/6d or twelve and a half   
 pence, and five pence for a set of    
 Donkey shoes.
