		<title>18ANNUAL EVENTS</title>
		<content>  There are several annual events that 
 take place in the area. In Catforth,  
 the{Field Day}is usually held in June.
 A Rose Queen or Rosebud is selected   
 for the year and is crowned at a      
 ceremony that takes place on Catforth 
 school field. The ceremony is preceded
 by a procession that goes from the    
 school to the Running Pump. Stalls and
 sports are a regular feature of the   
 Field Day. The Field Day is run by a  
 Field Day Committee.                  
  Events in Inskip are organised by a  
 social committee. Each year there is a
{Fun Day,}usually in July, and a       
{Village Show.}Both make use of the    
 facilities at H.M.S. Inskip, although 
 the Fun Day also makes use of other   
 facilities in the village.
