		<title>05HUTTON HENRY</title>
		<content> Our village is a very old village,    
 which goes back to the 9th century    
 when it was called Hotun. In old      
 English hoh-tun meant a hill spur     
 settlement.For a time the village     
 belonged to Henry-de-Esh and so it    
 became Hutton Henry.Walhouse and the  
 Old Hall are two of the oldest houses 
 in the village, but like all the      
 old houses are now modernised.On the  
 village green there is the old water  
 pump which is kept in good working    
 order by Mr.A.Johnson.This year       
 everyone in our school put their names
 and addresses on a piece of paper     
 which is now in a container in the    
 pump casing.Another interesting place 
 is Bushy Lane (sometimes called       
 Hangman's Lane)where a hanging is     
 supposed to have taken place. Records 
 show a man was executed in this       
 village in 1569.                      </content>
