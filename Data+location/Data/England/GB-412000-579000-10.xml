		<title>10WHALTON'S SHOPS AND PUB.</title>
		<content> Whalton villagers are lucky to still  
 be served by two shops:               
{The Post Office/General Store}has been
 run by Mary and Sid Law for 32 years. 
 As well as providing the post office  
 service the shop also sells groceries,
 newspapers in fact a vast range of    
 goods from paraffin to birthday cards.
 The shop acts as a centre of contact  
 for the villagers.                    
{The Butchers Shop is}run by Barras    
 Robson who spends most of his time out
 with his mobile butchers van. The shop
 itself is normally open on Thurs. and 
 Sat.and manned by 71 year old Marcus  
 Chisholm who has worked there for 34  
 years.                                
{The Beresford Arms}is now not so much 
 a village pub as a smart eating house 
 catering for visitors rather than     
 locals. They serve bar and restaurant 
 meals.                                </content>
