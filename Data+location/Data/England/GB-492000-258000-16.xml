		<title>16Staploe, Shopping</title>
		<content> There is no retail outlet in Staploe  
 parish. Of the original 6 public      
 houses, the last 3 have closed since  
 the war. The Three Horseshoes in      
 Staploe survived longest by selling   
 confectionary and cigarettes. The     
 nearest shop is in Eaton Socon. There 
 is one bus from Duloe and Staploe to  
 St. Neots, on Thursday (market day)   
 and none from Honeydon. Everyone,     
 therefore depends on deliveries, a car
 or neighbours. Milk is delivered on   
 alternate days. A baker calls 3 times 
 a week carrying some groceries, a     
 mobile shop once a week. Duloe and    
 staploe now have a wet fish delivery  
 which has not so far reached          
 Honeydon.Newspapers are delivered     
 daily from Sharnbrook and there is one
 postal delivery. An ice cream van with
 sweets  and cigarettes calls twice a  
 week. The library calls fortnightly.  </content>
