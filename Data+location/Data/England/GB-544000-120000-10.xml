		<title>10FARMING IN THE DISTRICT.</title>
		<content>    There are{6 owner occupied farms}on
 our patch,ranging in size from 330 to 
 26 acres,the average field size being 
 11 acres. The owners run their farms  
 with contract help at peak workload   
 times.In general they are{livestock}  
 farms with a little arable.It is      
 interesting that 2 of the farms were  
 dairy until 1981.The rearing of{cattle
 on grass is predominant,with the      
 animals wintering indoors on home     
 grown silage for 5 months.The smallest
 farm fattens between 40 and 100{sheep 
 a year.                               
    Some arable crops are grown,129    
 acres of{barley}and 150 acres of      
{wheat}.A little fruit and vegetable   
 growing takes place.Tractors are owned
 by all the farms but only 1 has a     
 combined harvester.                   
    The Uckfield by-pass has affected  
 Copwood Farm as you will read.        </content>
