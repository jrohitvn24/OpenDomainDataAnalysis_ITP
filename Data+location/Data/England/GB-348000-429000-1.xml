 Blind mans Bluff is an old game and is
 part of the recreation of many        
 children in this area. The rules are  
 that somebody is on and they tie a    
 handkerchief round their eyes so that 
 they can't see where they are going.  
  Somebody else spins them round so    
 they don't know which direction they  
 are facing.                           
 The blindfolded person counts to five 
 aloud and the others run and hide in  
 the room.After five seconds the       
 blindfolded person tries to find them.
 When he finds them he feels their face
 and if he gets his or her name wrong  
 you shout bluff and run off. When he  
 finds you again and gets your name    
 right you are on with him.
