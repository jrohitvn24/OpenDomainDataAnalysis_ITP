 GLOUCESTER SPA WAS OFFICIALLY OPENED  
 ON MAY 1ST,1815  IT WAS OWNED BY      
 WEALTHY SIR JAMES JELF.  THE NEW SPA  
 SUFFERED FROM THE COMPETITION OF      
 CHELTENHAM AND JELFS BUSINESS FELL    
 APART IN 1815 AND HE WAS MADE TO      
 RETIRE AS THE MAYOR.                  
 BUILDINGS ARE AN IMPORTANT EXAMPLE OF 
 THE CITY'S ARCHITECTURE.  GLOUCESTER  
 HAS FEW REGENCY BUILDINGS SO IT IS    
 IMPORTANT THAT THEY ARE SAVED.  THAT  
 IS WHY THE SPA WAS CALLED A           
 CONSERVATION AREA.  3-11A SPA RD. IS  
 A COLLEGE OF TECHNOLOGY BUILT IN 1829 
 BY JOHN PHILLPOTS AS A SPA HOTEL.     
 THERE IS A PARK IN THE SPA WHICH      
 CONTAINS A WAR MEMORIAL AND AN AVIARY 
 IN THE SUMMER ENTERTAINMENT OFTEN     
 COMES TO THE PARK INCLUDING A FAIR.
