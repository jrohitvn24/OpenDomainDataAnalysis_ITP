		<title>03May Fair</title>
		<content> The month of May is here and the      
 caravans and trailers are arriving in 
 Wool:the fair is here.                
 We can hear the continuous thrumming  
 of the generator,the shouts of people 
 enjoying the rides and the music      
 blaring.                              
 We enjoy eating candy floss and toffee
 apples.We have a go at the coconut shy
 The round-a-bouts go up and down.     
 We feel as though we are flying.      
 "Pick a lucky number",says the notice.
 We do,and win a gold fish.            
 The coloured lights blaze.            
 People bring their savings to spend.  
 A dodgem ride costs 50p.              
 Whatever will it cost in a few years  
 time?                                 
 Mr.Hyde (see page 2,Biography) said   
 that when he was a boy a ride on the  
 swing boats cost one old penny.
