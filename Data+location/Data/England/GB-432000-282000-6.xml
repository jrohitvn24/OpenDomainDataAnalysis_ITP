		<title>06THE CANAL NEAR OUR SCHOOL</title>
		<content>  The bridge just outside{Little Heath 
{Primary School}is bridge no 7 on the  
{Coventry Canal.}We know it as Old     
 Church Road Bridge. On the earliest   
 maps it was known as Little Heath     
 Bridge. It was then a traditional hump
 backed bridge. Just through the bridge
 on the towpath side is the Royal Hotel
 Public House. Stuart, John and I went 
 to the{canal repair crew.}People had  
 complained that water from the{canal  
 had been coming into their gardens so 
 a repair service from{British         
{Waterways}came. They started on Monday
 20th May. They used dredgers to plug  
 the leak with clay.Children from our  
 middle school went on the{Coventry    
{Canal}in a barge for their school trip
 this month.
