		<content> This area is almost entirely          
 intensively cultivated arable         
 farmland. Crops grown are potatoes,   
 wheat, sugar beet, onions and         
 horticulural crops such as            
 cauliflowers, lettuce, greens, also   
 some flower bulbs (daffodils and      
 tulips). The land is very flat and    
 extensively drained. Most of the farms
 are quite small, 50 to 100 acres. To  
 the West is part of the village of    
 Gosberton, near the road junction is  
 the Primary School, five to eleven    
 year old attend this school, roll 140,
 there is also a small park which is   
 used as a recreational area for the   
 school and village. There has been a  
 considerable number of new houses     
 built in Gosberton during the past 10 
 years. There is a home for the        
 elderly, Bank House, which has about  
 forty residents.                      </content>
