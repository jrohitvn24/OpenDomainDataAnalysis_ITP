		<title>07LANDSCAPE OF THE HARVEL AREA</title>
		<content> This is an area of outstanding natural
 beauty and also part of the Green     
 Belt.  This means that there are      
 restrictions to prevent the develop-  
 ment of housing and alteration of land
 use.  The scenery of these North Downs
 is beautiful with deep meandering     
 villages, wooded hills, magnificient  
 views and the steep escarpment of the 
 hills to the south.   The underlying  
 rocks are of chalk, resulting in good 
 land drainage with no rivers. There is
 clay overlying the chalk in some      
 places making crop growing possible.  
 Harvel has a picturesque pond with    
 ducks.  There are also ponds at Ham   
 and Great Buckland Farms.  Other ponds
 have been lost in the last 50 years   
 because the installation of tapped    
 water has precluded their use for     
 watering livestock.
