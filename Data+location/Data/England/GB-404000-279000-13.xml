		<title>13Siege (2) in Kings Heath</title>
		<content>Terror came to the heart of the suburb 
at 1.55 am., when a policewoman and a  
policeman were called to{Drayton Road} 
to investigate a resident's complaint  
that a man and a woman were shouting at
each other in the street. When the     
officers arrived there was no sign of  
trouble, then{someone fired a shotgun} 
and the policewoman was hit. She       
suffered two or three pellet wounds.   
The gunman then fired four or five     
shots at police officers. The police   
{evacuated some residents}from the     
street, but they believed it was safer 
for people living near the siege to    
stay where they were. Parents of       
children at the nearby{St. Dunstans    
Primary School}were told in an         
{emergency police message on radio}to  
keep youngsters at home. The siege     
ended at 3.45 when the police persuaded
the gunman to give himself up.         </content>
