		<title>13BADGERS ON THE LONG MYND</title>
		<content>                                       
                                       
 One of the main{badger woods}on the   
{Longmynd}is about one and a half miles
 outside Ratlinghope on the road to    
 Church Stretton over the Longmynd.It  
 is a{conifer wood}and most of the     
 setts are at the top of the wood near 
 the road.The best time to go badger   
 watching is about nine in the evening 
 just before it gets dark.You must be  
 careful to get in a good postion      
 downwind of the badgers because       
 although they have poor eyesight their
 sense of smell is excellent.By taking 
 up such a position it is easily       
 possible to get within a few feet     
 of them and watch completely          
 unobserved.                           
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
