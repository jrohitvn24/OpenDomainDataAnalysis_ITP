		<title>04NORMAN CHURCH GILLING WEST</title>
		<content>    There is evidence that a{monastery}
 was built in {Gilling} in the {7th   }
{century}on the site of the  present   
 church.This was destroyed by invading 
{Danes}in the{9th century}yet fragments
 of{Anglo _ Saxon}stones displayed in  
 the church porch would indicate that  
{Christian}worship took place in the   
{9th}and{10th centuries.}              
    The church was rebuilt following   
 the{Norman Conquest}and is mentioned  
 in the{Domesday Book.}In the{14th     
{century,}the North aisle was built,and
 about 100 years later the South aisle 
 was added,and the chancel built.      
    The tower was raised in the{15th } 
{century}and clear storey windows put  
 in to allow more light to enter the   
 church.Internal galleries,to seat land
 owners workers, were built in{1740.}In
{1845}these were demolished and a new  
 chancel and north aisle were built.   </content>
