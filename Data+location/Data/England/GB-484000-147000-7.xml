 users of the new village hall. We use 
 it every Monday evening at 6.00 p.m to
 7.45p.m.Our pack has about 25-30      
 guides split into 4 patrols called    
 Robin, Chaffinch,Bluetits and         
 Kingfishers. At the end of a guide    
 meeting we march into horseshoe       
 formation and sing "Taps".We do       
 different things such as chariot      
 racing,cooking on fires playing games,
 having treasure hunts and work for    
 badges.
