		<title>15SALISBURY'S COMMUNITY POLICE</title>
		<content>  A local community police officer     
 says that school children in Salisbury
 are generally well-behaved and few    
 complaints are made to the police. The
 main job of the police is for the     
 protection of life and property and   
 prosecution of people for comitting   
 offences.                             
 The days have gone when children run  
 away from policeman.The community     
 policing is really to build up a      
 relationship with the people in the   
 area.Children should speak to the     
 local policeman, saying "hello" or    
 "goodbye". More friendly contact with 
 the police is likely to mean fewer    
 crimes. The average crime rate for    
 children in this area is 3%; smoking  
 and shoplifting are the main offences.
 Police depend on teachers and parents 
 to help in their work. Community      
 policing is considered very important.</content>
