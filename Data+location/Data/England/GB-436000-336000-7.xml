		<title>07A DAY AT THE CARNIVAL</title>
		<content>{CHADDESDEN CARNIVAL}                  
                                       
 I woke up at seven and had my         
 breakfast, then made my way to Roe    
 Farm Club. I helped to make our float 
 because I was to be on it as a 'jail  
 house rock' girl. This was ready by   
 ten o'clock. Then I got ready and put 
 on a flared skirt and a neckerchief.  
 Then it was time to get on the float. 
 I wasn't nervous but on the way it    
 started to rain and I was absolutely  
 freezing. When we got to{Chaddesden   
{Park}the judges decided on the best   
 float. We didn't win despite all the  
 hard work. After half an hour on      
 the float we got changed for our      
 gymnastics display which took place   
 after lunch. I was nervous about the  
 display, I had to do hoola-hooping.   
 What a tiring day !
