		<title>15Children in Horton.</title>
		<content> The life-style of children in the     
 Horton area is like that of children  
 in many other country areas of Britain
 They have to get up early to catch    
 the minibus to take them to the junior
 school,which starts at 9.00 am,and    
 finishes at 3.30 pm.There are only 25 
 children at the school now and it is  
 likely to close next year.If a child  
 is over seven years old he or she will
 be in the primary part of the school. 
 If the child is under seven he or she 
 will be in the infants.There are two  
 mixed-age classes.After school some of
 the boys may play football at the     
 playing fields and some of the girls  
 may go horse-riding.Some girls attend 
 brownies once a week in Horton but    
 there is no cub pack for boys.Because 
 the population is very scattered there
 are not many organised activities.
