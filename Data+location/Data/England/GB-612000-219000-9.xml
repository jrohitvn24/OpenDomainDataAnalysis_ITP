		<title>09FOOTBALL CLUBS</title>
		<content>  The football club is not used very   
 often but it is kept in good condition
 and the grass is cut regularly. Next  
 to the football club there is{Weeley  
{Village Hall}wheremothers can take    
 their children to play. Also the      
 village hall gives tutorship in{music 
{and dancing}.                         
  Though in the area outside Weeley    
 Heath, sports are more popular. These 
 percentages only refer to the village 
 and not the outlying farms. So in     
 Weeley the village hall is the main   
 place for people to gather and as it  
 offers a wide range of facilities such
 as the{music, dancing and drama}or    
 just a place to take one's children to
 play, it is considered a great place  
 of interest in Weeley.
