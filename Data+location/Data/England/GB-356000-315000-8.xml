 My alarm bleeps at 6:10am. I get up to
 switch the television on for Breakfast
 T.V before washing and dressing for   
 school. After that I make my breakfast
 which consists of "Shredded Wheat" and
 a slice of toast. I watch Breakfast   
 T.V for a few minutes before packing  
 my bags for school. After I have      
 cleaned my teeth I set off for school 
 at 9:10am. School starts at 9:15am. In
 the morning we work at Maths or       
 English. At 10:45am we have a break   
 which lasts for 15 minutes,then after 
 break we work at a different          
 subject. Lunch is at 12:15pm. During  
 the afternoon we do Topic Work and    
 Physical Education or Games. School   
 ends at 3:30pm. At 7:00pm we travel to
 Shrewsbury for an organ lesson which  
 lasts for 60 minutes.
