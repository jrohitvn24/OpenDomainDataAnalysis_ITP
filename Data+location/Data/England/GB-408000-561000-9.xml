		<content> The new library in Front Street was   
 opened to the public on December 14th,
 1984. The cost was Â£248,000.          
   The head librarian organises        
 competitions, and sees that all of the
 books are in the correct order, helped
 by 2 full time and 3 part time        
 assistants. The library is also used  
 by the Citizens Advice Bureau, The    
 Local History Society and a slimming  
 club. The library now lends out       
 records and the more popular          
 cassettes. A micro-computer is also   
 available for library use only.       
   Last year 425565 adult books were   
 borrowed and  53002 childrens books   
 were borrowed. Each year 5640 are     
 removed from the shelves in order to  
 make room for new ones.
