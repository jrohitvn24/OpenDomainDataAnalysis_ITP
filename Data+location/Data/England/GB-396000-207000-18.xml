		<title>18FARM STUDY DUNTISBOURNE LEER</title>
		<content> The farm is small for the area , 100  
 acres,and has been worked by the      
 farmer alone since 1948.Most of the   
 buildings ,including the pigsty (now  
 used for ducks),are listed.The farm-  
 house ,dating from 1517,has pigeon    
 holes,a reminder of a cheap source of 
 meat for the Lord long ago.In 1985 the
 farmer is concentrating on wheat,     
 barley and peas ,hoping this will     
 bring greatest profit.Peas replaced   
 sheep this year for profit reasons and
 because sheep took up more of the     
 farmer's time.Next year might be      
 different.Hay is grown to feed his    
 horses and to sell locally as an      
 animal feed.It is only grown on land  
 too steep or too poor to grow more    
 profitable crops.A small experimental 
 plot of Christmas trees is being tried
 and elsewhere trees have been planted 
 to hide farm buildings.               </content>
