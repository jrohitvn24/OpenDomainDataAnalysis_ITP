		<content> Since 1834, the priests have always   
 been{Benedictine}fathers. In recent   
 years, the inside of the church has   
 started to crumble, so it has been{   
{restored}and now looks more modern.   
 The{Ecumenical Centre}is next to the  
 Job Centre in the Kingfisher Shopping 
 Centre. It is 10 years old and is used
 not only as a church but also for play
 groups and Brownies. It also has a    
 cafe. The{Redditch Mosque}in Easemore 
 Road used to be a house. It is a      
 building for Muslims to pray in. Some 
 of the children from St. Stephen's    
 First School go to the Mosque to pray 
 and to learn the Koran. There is also 
 a{Baptist}church and a{Salvation Army 
 building in our 12km block. In 1985 a 
 new{Methodist}church, St. Andrew's,   
 was built in Church Hill. A much older
 Methodist church remains in Alcester  
 Street.                               </content>
