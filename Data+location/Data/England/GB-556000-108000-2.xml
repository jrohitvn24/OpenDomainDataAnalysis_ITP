		<title>02ST. MARY'S CHURCH, HAILSHAM</title>
		<content>   The present church probably dates   
 from the middle of the{15th century,  
 although there is evidence of it's    
 existence in{1229.}It is built in the 
 perpendicular style. The tower is     
 square and built of sandstone blocks  
 alternating with squares of{knapped   
 flints.                               
   Up until{1939}they used to ring the 
 curfew at 8pm in Hailsham using the   
 tenor bell in the church tower. A     
 clock has also been installed to      
 celebrate Queen Victoria's Diamond    
 Jubilee.There are eight bells dating  
 from{1663,}five have been recast.     
   There is only one original window   
 because all the windows were destroyed
 when a bomb fell nearby in{1943.      
 An extension is now being added to the
 church which will provide a meeting   
 place with a kitchen and toilets.
