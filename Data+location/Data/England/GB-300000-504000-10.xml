		<title>10A day on a farm in Beckermet</title>
		<content>  I live at Low Godderthwaite Farm with
my parents and two older brothers.I get
up at 7.20a.m. when my brothers come   
downstairs.I eat my breakfast of cereal
while still in my nightdress.After     
clearing the breakfast things I brush  
the chairs.I change into my jeans,     
shirt,socks and shoes, then mum and I  
go picking potatoes.We have a special  
machine called a Potato Harvester.We   
sort the potatoes from the soil before 
they are bagged.At 10a.m. we have a    
break during which we eat cheese       
sandwiches and cake followed by coffee.
Then we continue picking potatoes.We go
home to make dinner about noon.After   
dinner we go Combine Harvesting.I help 
by leading bales, sometimes I have to  
drive the tractor.After leading bales  
all afternoon mum and I make the tea.  
Then we start milking our herd of cows.
I go to bed about 10.30p.m.            </content>
