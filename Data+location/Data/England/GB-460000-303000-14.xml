		<title>14Languages in East Leicester.</title>
		<content> My name is Vilash Patel &amp; I live near 
 Spinney Hill Park. In this area many  
 people speak different languages.     
 Muslims speak Urdu,Hindus speak       
 Gujerati,Sikhs speak Punjabi &amp; British
 people speak English. We can find out 
 about other people's languages at     
 libraries,community centres,mosques   
 etc. Muslim children are taught how to
 read &amp; write Urdu at their mosques. At
 my school &amp; local library I can find  
 books written in different languages. 
 Community centres &amp; voluntary groups  
 help people to read,write &amp; speak     
 English by holding English classes.   
 Nearly all the children in my class   
 speak English as a second language. At
 home my friends &amp; I like to speak     
 English rather than our mother tongue,
 Gujerati.I don't know how to read &amp;   
 write Gujerati,but there are places   
 where I can go to learn.              </content>
