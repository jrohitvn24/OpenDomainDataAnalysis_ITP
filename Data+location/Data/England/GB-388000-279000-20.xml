		<title>20THE COBHAM FAMILY IN 1985</title>
		<content>   The Cobham title came to the family 
 in 1889,and the present incumbent is  
 John,11th Viscount.His wife,{Penelope,
 was interviewed by pupils on 9th July.
   The present-day estate covers about 
 2000 acres and there are{no plans to  
{change the Hall}or its grounds in the 
 near future.  Lady Cobham has lived at
 the Hall for 11 years and loves the   
 landscape, but sometimes regrets      
 having to have the Hall open to the   
 public.  She said that they have to   
 hold events at the Hall to enable them
 to{maintain the house.                
   Lady Cobham was non-commital on     
 important local issues, such as the   
 by-pass or leisure provision.  She    
{likes Hagley village}enormously, for  
 its fascinating atmosphere, good shops
 and convenience.  She considers       
 herself very lucky to live in such a  
 beautiful area.                       </content>
