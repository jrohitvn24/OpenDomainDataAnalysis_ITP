		<content> The Fortune Centre, which seeks to    
 train and rehabilitate handicapped and
 disturbed young people through riding 
 and allied activities has part of its 
 impressive facilities at Wootton Hall 
 on the edge of the New Forest. The    
 idea for the centre was conceived by  
 the Hon. Mrs P.C. Baillie and Mrs Y.  
 Nelson and opened in 1981. Each week  
 more than 100 children and young      
 people whose handicaps range from     
 severe mental and physical to social  
 deprivation visit the centre free of  
 charge. Training courses for R.D.A.   
 voluntary helpers are also run.       
 Residential rehabilitation courses are
 available for lesser handicapped      
 students or those suffering from      
 temporary emotional disorders who wish
 to train as assistants in equestrian  
 fields. The centre also runs a 3 year 
 course for the training of therapists.</content>
