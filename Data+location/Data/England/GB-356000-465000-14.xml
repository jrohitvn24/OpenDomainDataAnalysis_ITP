		<content>The computer was installed in summer   
1985.The main frame is at head office  
in Preston.Each depot has its own ter- 
minal linked by British Telecom.It con-
trols stock-taking,order forms,delivery
tickets and cash and carry sales re-   
ceipts.Each day all orders are passed  
to Preston and processed there. The    
system has cut down the paperwork and  
human error and provides rapid response
to customer queries.Business is season-
al following the needs of the farmer.It
normally depends on farmers doing well 
but in 1985 the wet weather caused far-
mers to buy in more feedstuffs than    
usual as their own fodder crops are    
poor.                                  
LUWKA is one of a network of long term 
government storage depots containing   
food to be available in time of nation-
al crisis including nuclear war.It is  
situated by the Preston Farmers depot. </content>
