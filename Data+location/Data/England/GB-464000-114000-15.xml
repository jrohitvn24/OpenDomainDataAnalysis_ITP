		<content> Although cricket was played earlier in
 other parts of England,{Hambledon}has 
 become known around the world as "the 
 cradle of cricket" because of the     
 success of its village club.Between   
 the years 1772 and 1781,it won 29 of  
 the 51 matches it played against      
 England teams.The cricket was played  
 on{Broad Halfpenny Down.}The players  
 wore sky-blue coats,white shirts and  
 breeches and gold laced tricorne hats.
 A curved bat was used and there were  
 only two stumps at each end.Opposite  
 the cricket ground stood the{Bat and  
{Ball Inn.}Its landlord was captain of 
 the club and his decisions on the     
 rules of cricket were accepted by the 
 leading players of the day.Mementoes  
 of the club are preserved at the{Bat  
{and Ball Inn.}Immediately opposite    
 there is a granite obelisk inscribed  
 with two bats,a ball and stumps.      </content>
