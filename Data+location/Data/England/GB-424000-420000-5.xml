 open on Mondays, Wednesdays and       
 Fridays from 6.30 to 9.00pm.The       
 entrance fee is 15p.We play rounders  
 and netball,and play and dance to     
 records.                              
 I also read in my leisure time and I  
 enjoy adventure books by Enid Blyton.I
 also enjoy writing my own stories.I go
 swimming with my friends at Dewsbury  
 Sports Centre. Apart from netball and 
 rounders I enjoy a game of 'pegs' with
 my friends and we go cycling.I like   
 listening to records and Paul Young is
 my favourite pop singer.As a hobby I  
 like collecting old coins.            
 On a Saturday we pay a visit to       
 Dewsbury and I spend all my money on  
 the market there.In the afternoon I   
 go to Chickenley Cricket Club and     
 watch the men play cricket.
