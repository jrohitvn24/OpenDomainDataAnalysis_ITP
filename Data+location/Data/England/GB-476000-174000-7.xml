 when I grow up. My Mum's hobbies are  
 gardening and eating Helman's         
 mayonnaise. My dad's hobbies are      
 making money, business and playing    
 hockey.                               
{Simon:}I go to Youth Club from 6.30 to
 8.30 on Thursday. There is a sweet    
 shop,a pot black table, table tennis  
 and a dart board. My favourite thing  
 is the pot black table.

 a Youth Club. My hobby is finding out
