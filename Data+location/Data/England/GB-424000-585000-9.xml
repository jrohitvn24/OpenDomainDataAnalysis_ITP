		<title>09Housing Types.</title>
		<content>  Ashignton has many types of housing  
 ,some of which were built for the     
 colliery workers.The colliery houses  
 consisted of 9 rows.These houses were 
 very well built and some of the rows  
 have been knocked down to make way for
 new estate houses to accomadate modern
 needs.The new estate houses were meant
 to look modern but they are cold and  
 damp unlike the pit houses which were 
 warm,dry and cosy.Many of the upper   
 class houses are in Wansbeck Road and 
 Green Lane,some of which were owned by
 pit managers and bosses.Middle class  
 houses are found all over Ashington   
 some terraced,some semi detached and  
 some detached.New estates are being   
 built around Ashington.
