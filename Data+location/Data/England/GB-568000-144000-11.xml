		<title>11WATER SUPPLY ON A FARM</title>
		<content> We visited a farm in our area. It     
has approximately 400 acres of         
farmland .This requires a constant     
supply of water,which is extracted     
from the River Teise.The water is      
extracted along a system of            
pipes,which is powered by 2,  100      
horse power engines.These are manually 
operated.The level of water is         
controlled by an automatically         
operated sluice gate.Any rubbish such  
as leaves,crisp packets etc. are       
filtered from the water by a wire      
gauze film.The water is then pumped    
through another system of pipes        
leading to a standpipe,from where      
the water can be used.There are also   
other pipes leading to an apple        
orchard within the farm.The water is   
then pumped up a vertical pipe which   
sprays the orchard.Some farms in the   
area received grants for reservoirs.   </content>
