		<title>11BOATING</title>
		<content>   We counted the boats on a half mile 
 stretch of the river.There were 208   
 boats altogether of many shapes and   
 sizes.Many of them were small rowing  
 boats beached on the mud which are    
 probably used either for pleasure or  
 for people to row out to larger yachts
 and cabin cruisers.There were fifteen 
 barges,some fishing boats and the rest
 were yachts and pleasure craft.       
   There is a yacht club at the bottom 
 end of the promenade from which lots  
 of races take place.People use some of
 the barges as their home.They provide 
 quite spacious living accomodation.   
   Many of the boats are marked with a 
 number such as MN180 and MN89 to show 
 they were registered in Maldon.
