		<content> When the comprehensive was created new
 buildings were added which now form   
 the site of the Upper School. The     
 first Headmaster of the new           
 comprehensive is {Mr A.S. Worrall}who 
 was created an O.B.E. in 1984 for     
 services to education and the         
 community in general.                 
      During 1985 a new indoor swimming
 pool and squash courts are being added
 for use by all the local schools and  
 the community.                        
      As the Royal Naval Air Station at
 Culdrose expanded it was necessary to 
 build two new junior schools,Parc     
 Eglos and Nansloe, and in 1983, the   
 two St Michael's schools were joined  
 together to make one school. The      
 school today has about 320 pupils and 
 11 teachers.
