		<title>151st Holy Communion</title>
		<content>   On the day the{first year juniors}  
 made their{first Holy Communion}we    
 were above them in the choir loft of{ 
{St. Clare's Church.}There were lots of
 people. The boys and girls who were   
 making their communion looked very    
 nice. Fr. Barry{celebrated}the{Mass.} 
 Mrs Graham played the{organ}and       
 everyone said afterwards how good the{
{singing}was. We all got a lift back to
 school. To celebrate, we had a{       
{breakfast}of cakes and crisps and all 
 sorts. I had a very good time.        
   Inside the church there were cobwebs
 hanging from the ceiling. The{windows}
 are very{colourful.}When you are at   
 the back of the church you can't hear 
 very well. There are beautiful{statues
 in the church and beautiful pictures  
 too. St. Clare's Church is our{parish 
{church. }
