		<content> The weather varies considerably       
 throughout the year but not to any    
 great extreme.  Any snowfall tends to 
 drift blocking roads because the land 
 is flat and open.  In warm dry summer 
 seasons sand storms occur due to the  
 flatness of land and the sandy soil.  
 This has been aggrevated by farmers   
 cutting down and removing trees and   
 hedgerows to make larger easier to    
 work fields.                          
 The country roads are in a resonable  
 condition but some are very narrow    
 particularly in view of the large farm
 machinery in use today.  Many verges  
 are damaged by cars trying to pass    
 each other.                           
 The buildings in the villages are     
 generally pleasant but improvements   
 could be made to pavements, there     
 being only three in Marston but more  
 are planned.                          </content>
