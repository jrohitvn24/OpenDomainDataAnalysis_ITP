		<content> The major industry in the area is     
 agriculture and many other industries 
 are connected with this. Palethorpes  
 manufacture pies, cooked meats and    
 pizzas at their Maer Lane factory.    
 SKH manufacture farm machinery at     
 their Adderley Road premises which    
 were originally used for the          
 manufacture of prefabricated          
 buildings. Vantec assemble electrical 
 components in a factory adjacent to   
 the Tern at Walkmill. This factory,   
 built on a council rubbish tip, was   
 originally concerned with the shaping 
 of nylon stockings.                   
 The largest employer of labour is     
 Kitty Little, manufacturers of spice  
 ropes for the home and export market. 
 However most of these workers are     
 homeworkers and the company has a     
 small headquarters on the new         
 industrial estate in Maer Lane.       </content>
