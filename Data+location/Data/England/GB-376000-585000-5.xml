		<content> There is a bus service from Bellingham
 to Kielder but very few buses. People 
 without cars are worried that this    
 service may disappear altogether as   
 very few use it, most families have   
 cars. The water supply for Greenhaugh 
 and Lanehead comes from Catcleugh. The
 mains pipe continues up the north side
 of the river. On the south side and in
 more remote parts people rely on      
 springs which sometimes dry up in     
 summer. A mobile library travels the  
 area visiting the villages fortnightly
 &amp; more remote parts monthly. Children 
 are able to borrow books from school  
 where there is a large selection from 
 the County Library which is changed   
 each term. There is a library in      
 Bellingham. The NE Electricity Board  
 supplies all but the most remote      
 cottages. These use calor gas, coal,  
 wood and oil for fuel.                </content>
