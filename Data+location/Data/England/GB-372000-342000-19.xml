		<title>19TALKING TO OLDER PEOPLE</title>
		<content> This village has changed so much over 
 the past ten years.                   
 It is interesting to listen to people 
 like Mrs. Chidlow, who was the school 
 caretaker until last year.            
 She remembers the{horse-race meeting, 
 which was held every year, when the   
 school was closed for a holiday; and  
 when the only water for the school was
 a{pump}in the playground.             
 Mr. Simister, Mr. Baker, Mrs. Chidlow 
 and others have told us how strict    
 school was.  They told us how people  
 used to go to the Village Hall for    
{filmshows,}and when a day out for     
 the school was going on a cart to     
 someone's field to have games and a   
 tea. A special day was the Cricket    
 Club Knock-out Competition.           
 The children who went to the grammar  
 school at Stoke or Market Drayton went
 by train from Pipe Gate.              </content>
