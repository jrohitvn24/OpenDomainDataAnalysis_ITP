		<title>08Housing In Bawdeswell</title>
		<content> Bawdeswell was named in the Domesday  
 Book as Baldersuella and was mentioned
 in Chaucer's Canterbury Tales, hence  
 the carving of the Reeve on the       
 village sign ( the last one made by   
 Harry Carter of Swaffham before his   
 death in 1983 ). The half-timbered    
 Chaucer House, said to have been the  
 home of the poet's uncle, is the      
 oldest dwelling. Some 19'th century   
 houses, built when B'well was part of 
 the Holkham estate, are of sandstone  
 from Holkham and brick from a local   
 kiln. 235 homes include modern estate 
 types, many of them bungalows, costing
 between Â£25000 &amp; Â£30000, 61 are       
 council houses, Folland Court is a    
 complex of council group homes for the
 elderly. The remains of a smithy still
 survive. The largest residence is     
 Bawdeswell Hall, dating from 1633,    
 home of the Gurney Family.            </content>
