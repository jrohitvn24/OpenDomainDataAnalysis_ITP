      THE LONDON TO BRIGHTON           
                                       
  In 1985 Balcombe School performed a  
 play called "The Day that the Train   
 Came by".The play was about when the  
 first train came to Balcombe on the   
 London to Brighton line that is just  
 behind Balcombe School.the railway    
 line was finished in 1841.Nowadays    
 many of the trains pass through       
 Balcombe without stopping,although at 
 rush hour the platform is filled with 
 commuters.Many adults from Balcombe   
 work in London.There have recently    
 been two accidents one of which was   
 very serious.A train that was going   
 too fast hit the edge of the platform 
 near Balcombe station.Some of the     
 wheels jumped onto the platform.This  
 all happened at night.In the morning  
 a crane on wheels came to clear away. </content>
