		<content>{Claire Lawton}(age 9) lives in Shaw.  
 "I like it in some ways but not in    
 others. When the new houses come near 
 us there will be more people to play  
 with but I liked going into the field 
 next to us where there is a stream,   
 soon I won't be able to go in. But it 
 will be a while before the builder    
 reaches us so I might as well make the
 most of the time I've got !".         
{Mrs. M.U. Leatherland}has lived in    
 Shaw for 20 years.                    
 "To those of us who preferred the     
 peace and quiet of the country, free  
 from diesel fumes it is a nightmare.  
 Now they have cut the village into 3  
 pieces, most of us in this area feel  
 nothing but contempt for the council  
 who cares nothing for the people      
 living here. I'm sure we are the only 
 town in the world with so many        
 roundabouts ".                        </content>
