		<content> There is very  little industry in  the
 major part of the block,as most of the
 land is devoted to agriculture .      
 That which exists is mainly confined  
 to the edge of Chard included in just 
 one of the sub sections.              
  In 1985 the oldest factory buildings 
 are occupied  by{a company            
 who repair{Ministry of Defence        
 equipment, primarily for the RAF.     
 Their buildings date from 1842 when   
 the firm of Robert Dening made iron   
 castings for a wide variety of farm   
 equipment which can still be seen on  
 farms in Southern England .The site   
 is soon to be developed as part of the
 North Glynswood housing estate and the
 business will then close.             
{Eagle Plant}hire heavy machinery for  
 road construction including fork lift 
 trucks and road-rollers and           
 compressors.                          </content>
