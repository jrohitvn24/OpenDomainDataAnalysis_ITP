		<title>18EASTNOR VILLAGE</title>
		<content>  As Eastnor is only a small village,  
 and not many vehicles come though the 
 actual village, the pollution level   
 is very low.In a traffic survey, on   
 the road that goes past the famous    
 post office we saw 1 push bike,52     
 cars, 12 vans and 3 landrovers.       
  There is a military air base nearby, 
 so we very often get Hercules carrier 
 planes and Tornado fighters passing   
 overhead and flying very low at about 
 30 metres.                            
  The weather in Eastnor isn't very    
 good most of the time because we get  
 clouds up from the Bristol channel,   
 which arrive on the Malvern hills!    
  There are many well kept footpaths   
 around the Deer park and Obelisk,     
 used by the many tourists.
