		<content>Honington could be quiet but there is  
a main road and lots of aeroplanes.    
You can hear the birds and there are   
lots of trees around.                  
Half of the houses in Honington are    
thatched and the rest have slate or    
tiled roofs. Many of the walls are of  
flint and some are plaster. The modern 
houses are mostly made of brick.       
 The village is about a mile and a     
half from the air-base, and is quite   
separate, apart from the noise!        
 East of Honington is the small linked 
village of Sapiston, whilst South is   
Ixworth Thorpe, the northern part of   
which contains the local public House, 
The Royal Oak. In Honington the local  
pub is The Fox.
