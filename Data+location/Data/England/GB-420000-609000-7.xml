		<title>07CONDITION OF FOOTPATHS.</title>
		<content> The footpaths in the 12 km.sq. are all
 signposted with clear writing to      
 indicate exactly where they are. But  
 unfortunately this does not mean that 
 they are{easy}to walk on. In most     
 cases it is completely the opposite.  
 The farmers have often{ploughed over} 
 the footpaths which went straight     
 across the field, so we had to walk   
 around the outside. This is often very
 difficult now, mainly because the     
 fields were ploughed right up to the  
 fences, so we had to walk in the      
 furrows along the edge of the fields.
