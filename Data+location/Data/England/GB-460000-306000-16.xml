		<title>16BELGRAVE OR BEL'S GRAVE ?</title>
		<content> This is the old legend of how{Belgrave
 got its name.Many years ago when      
 giants roamed the land a boastful     
 giant called Bel said he could get to 
 Leicester in three mighty leaps.To    
 prove this he mounted his sorrel mare 
 at a place called{Mountsorrel}and took
 his first mighty leap.He rode by      
{Rothley }and landed in{Wanlip}(one    
 leap).He then jumped a second time and
 landed in{Birstall},so called because 
 his horse "burst its all" and couldn't
 go on.His third and final leap landed 
 one and a half miles short of         
 Leicester and there he was buried in a
 place called{Belgrave}(Bel's grave).  
                                       
 Of course this is only a legend.In the
 Domesday Book Belgrave was known as   
 Merdegrave but the Normans soon       
 renamed it Belgrave (beautiful grove) 
 This translated better into French!   </content>
