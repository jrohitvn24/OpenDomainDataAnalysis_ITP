		<content>{FLORA, BIRDS NEAR DUNSMORE            
 Apart from the more common birds such 
 as the Tit family, Green and Lesser   
 Spotted Wood Peckers, Owls and other  
 passerines, the Meadow Pipit, Redstart
 and Wood Warbler all breed in this    
 area. Some less usual flowers which   
 can be seen on the higher land are    
 Giant Bellflower, Felwort, Broad,     
 leaved Helleborine, Common Spotted    
 Orchid, Pyramidal Orchid and Gentiana 
 Ciliata; a rare, tiny, blue_fringed   
 flower, first recorded c.1850.        
 Blackberries abound in the hedgerows  
 and on the open hilltop where also is 
 found a delicately flavoured wild     
 Raspberry. The hedgerows bordering the
 old, sunken lanes are high and mixed  
 with Hazel, Bramble, Hawthorn, Briar  
 and Elder. Holly and Beech trees      
 sometimes protrude from them, higher  
 than the line of the hedge.           </content>
