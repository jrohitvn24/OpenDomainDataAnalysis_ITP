		<title>02FECKENHAM VILLAGE</title>
		<content> The village of Feckenham is extremly  
 picturesque. It is built around a     
 village green or square. The church is
 on one side of the green with a pub on
 the other. All around the green are   
 small pretty cottages.                
  The village is quite densly          
 populated, with many houses and       
 cottages fronting straight onto the   
 road. The village has an active social
 life, revolving around the church,    
 village hall and First School.        
   The First School is situated some   
 distance from the village, not        
 adjacent to the church as you would   
 expect for a Church School.           
  The houses vary in age from before   
 the last Domesday survey to brand new.
 Many houses and cottages have been    
 recently renovated and modernised.    
  There is also the site of KING JOHN'S
 royal Hunting lodge.                  </content>
