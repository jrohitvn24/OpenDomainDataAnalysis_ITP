		<content>      Hornchurch and Upminster are     
 pleasant residential areas on the     
 outskirts of London.   They have tube 
 and mainline stations which are       
 convenient for people who commute to  
 work.                                 
      Many streets are lined with      
 trees.   Housing areas are separated  
 by parks and open spaces.   Dwellings 
 are detached, semi-detached, terraced 
 or bungalows.   There are small blocks
 of flats which are two, three or more 
 stories high.   Some have been        
 built during the 1930's and some quite
 recently.   The houses are quite      
 expensive especially if they are near 
 a station.   Nearly all the houses are
 owner-occupied.                       
      Hornchurch was once the larger   
 town with a cattle market and         
 agricultural functions.   Today both  
 are part of the London conurbation.   </content>
