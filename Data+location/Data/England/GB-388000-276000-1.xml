		<title>01Blakedown and Broome</title>
		<content> Our area lies 20 miles west of        
 Birmingham, the nearest towns are     
 Kidderminster (3 miles S.W.) and      
 Worcester (15 miles S).Blakedown and  
 Broome are the two villages in our    
 largely rural area. Despite its       
 position, it is still a typical       
 area of Worcestershire being          
 mainly agricultural. There are no     
 factories and few signs of the        
 industrial sprawl that has spoiled    
 other areas on the fringe of          
 Birmingham.                           
 The green lush farmland dominates the 
 area, broken only by the higher land  
 of Barnett Hill in the S.W. Rainfall  
 is high and many streams cross the    
 area with lakes, springs and wells in 
 abundance. Centuries ago the area was 
 forested - being part of the ancient  
 Forest of Wyre and many trees remain  
 today in copses and hedgerows.        </content>
