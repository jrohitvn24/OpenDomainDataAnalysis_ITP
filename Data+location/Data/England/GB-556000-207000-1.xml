 agriculture- mainly cereals.   Some   
 animals are kept - sheep and          
 pigs.There are a very few minor       
 industrial  concerns.                 
 It is sparsely populated;  the        
 majority of residents are commuters or
 retired people.    It is within the   
 Green Belt area and within easy access
 of London.   There is one main road   
 which runs through it (B 184)  from   
 Fyfield to Dunmow.  The               
 scenery is rolling and  slightly      
 undulating with  typically pleasing   
 Essex views.   The Dutch Elm disease  
 of a few years ago virtually wiped out

 The area  is the habitat of many      
 common birds as well as the Red-      
 backed Shrike which is nesting in the
