		<content> In addition to the regular church     
 services Cotton End Baptist Church is 
 actively engaged in encouraging       
 community spirit.  There is a mid-week
 club for games and Bible reading which
 has an attendance of between 25 and 30
 five to ten year olds.  During the    
 summer holidays the childrens club has
 a four day holiday programme.         
 Occasionally, after Church on Sunday, 
 a "frugal meal" is enjoyed.           
 Participants eat soup, bread and      
 cheese and contribute a sum of money  
 to the "tear fund".  For the teenagers
 there is a musical workshop and a     
 variety of evening functions, like the
 Italian  evening soon to be enjoyed.  
 At Christmas members of the Church    
 carol sing, not specifically to raise 
 money, but as a celebration of this   
 festival. The Church Hall is used by  
 playgoup and mothers and toddlers.    </content>
