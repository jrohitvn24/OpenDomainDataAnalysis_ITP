		<title>20PARISH COUNCIL</title>
		<content>{The Parish Council}consists of 6      
 members, elected for four years and a 
 part-time clerk. It nominates 2       
 primary school governors, is the      
 trustee of Tackley Heath and provides 
 allotments. It provides and maintains 
 the street lighting and safeguards the
 field footpaths by walking them once a
 year. It obtained a loan to give a    
 grant towards the{village hall.} The  
 latest project was the purchase,      
 drainage and seeding of land to add to
 the{playing fields}and{children's play
{area}which the council controls.      
 Observations on planning applications 
 to the {District Council}are seen as a
 major part of its duty. It presses the
{County Council}for road repairs and   
 improvements. Its main aim, though, is
 to encourage self-help in the village.
