		<title>01OVERVIEW OF EASTERN COVENTRY</title>
		<content> 55% of the area is suburban ;45% is   
 the rural fringe beyond the city      
 boundary including intensively farmed 
 pasture,drained by the Sowe,and the   
 woodland and pool of Coombe Park.Much 
 of this open land will disappear from 
 1986 under the Eastern By-Pass and    
 expected new development.             
 The suburban area was formerly two    
 villages,Wyken,an old mining          
 community,and Walsgrave,a former wool 
 producing centre.Evidence of former   
 times includes Caludon Castle.Inter-  
 war ribbon development along the      
 A46,was followed by large scale,      
 post-war infilling.                   
 The area today contains mainly middle-
 class housing,12 Primary and 2        
 Comprehensive schools,a college,large 
 hospital,2 hypermarkets,small shopping
 centres and a modern industrial       
 estate.                               </content>
