		<content>   There is very little industry in the
 area, most of it is in the north east 
 corner on the{Curtis Road Estate}near 
 Dorking Town Station.                 
   The largest firm is{Johnston        
{Engineering}which has been established
 for 65 years and makes{road sweepers  
 and{dustcarts}for councils all over   
 the country. Other light engineering  
 firms make{equipment for the railway  
 and{wire winding machinery.}There is  
 also a mill which produces{animal     
{compounds}for local farmers.          
   In all just over 600 people are     
 employed on the estate, the majority  
 of whom are men who live in the       
 Dorking area.                         
   Outside the Curtis Road Estate there
 is the{National Employers Life        
{Insurance Company}which employs 400   
 people. The company is situated in a  
 54 acre estate on the A25.            </content>
