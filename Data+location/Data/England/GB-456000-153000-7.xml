		<content> We interviewed the head keeper        
 of Manydown Park. He has been a keeper
 for thirty_six years and head keeper  
 with a tied house for the last        
 nine.His work involves both raising   
 pheasant,partridge and deer for sport 
 and generally managing the wildlife   
 of the area.Manydown Park is very     
 conservation oriented and all the     
 hedges are retained.In addition six   
 metre square of ground has been left  
 comeletely natural for several        
 years.Thirty_five species of butterfly
 (as opposed to nine before) and the   
 increasing number of beetles has      
 caused the English partridge          
 population to triple.Although poaching
 is not a big problem,the keeper has   
 seen and been upset by animals caught 
 and maimed in snares.He is also       
 angered by people setting loose       
 animals like mink.                    </content>
