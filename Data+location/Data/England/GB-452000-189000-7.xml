		<content>The Royal Berkshire Court is a private 
Home, unlike Ladygrove, a Council Home,
which is mentioned on Page 5.  There   
are 60 rooms, 50 women and 10 men.     
There are 4 staff and there is a 3 year
waiting list for admission.  Mrs Scott,
the Warden is in charge.  Mrs Swanzy   
has a broken leg.  She enjoys it at The
Royal Berkshire Court.  They have a big
garden to share.  They each have a room
of their own and all the furniture is  
their own.  Ladygrove, previously      
mentioned , is one stage lower than    
Berkshire Court: some people might go  
on from Ladygrove to The Royal         
Berkshire Court.  They have lots of    
activities in the home, like bingo,    
whist and bridge.  A doctor is on hand 
if a resident is ill.  Most of the     
people who go to the R.B.C. do so      
because they like the company and      
meeting lots of their friends.         </content>
