		<title>20NETHERTON VALLEY - UPTON</title>
		<content> The{Netherton Valley }is reached by an
 unclassified road to the north of{    
{Hurstbourne Tarrant.}It's wide grass  
 verges are favourite picnicing        
 places.There were two entrances to    
 Doiley Manor from this road, but one,a
 stone arch, now forms the entrance to 
 Prosperous Farm. The iron gate in this
 arch came from Newgate Prison. A local
 ghost story happens in this area. A   
 dancing light is seen to cross the    
 A343 on the hill to the north of      
 Prosperous Farm. It travels into the  
 fields before disappearing.A local    
 sheepdog refused to walk past the     
 place, and had to be taken home       
 another way. The bridge in the field  
 on the right of the valley, carries   
 the Manor drive across an old cattle  
 droving route. There is a teasel bed  
 still growing in{Upton}a remnant from 
 the days when the wool trade thrived. </content>
