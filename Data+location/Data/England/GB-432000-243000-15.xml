 Tysoe nestles at the foot of the      
 escarpment between Tysoe Hill and     
 Sunrising Hill. The landscape is a    
 patchwork of fields with neatly       
 trimmed hedges and a lot of trees,    
 particularly in and around Upper      
 Tysoe. Ridge and furrow can still be  
 seen along the base of the escarpment 
 which is wooded for 2/3 of its length 
 with softwoods planted in the early   
 1960s. The proportion of arable fields
 to grassland is about 50/50. The trees
 are mainly oak, ash, and sycamore,    
 with willows along the two main       
 watercourses - Tysoe brook and Foxes  
 brook.
