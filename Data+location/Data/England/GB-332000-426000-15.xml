		<content>     Along the front is a 100 year old 
 lake,now extended to Fairhaven        
 lake.Seasonal but only profitable in  
 summer.Cost of boat trips are 'motor  
 boats_95p, Rowing boats_60p, Yachts_  
 Â£2.00'.In high season there are       
 perhaps 2,000 visitors weekly.        
 Improvements include new boats and a  
 nearby pitch and putt.About 30 people 
 work here.The two Bowling greens may  
 take 200 and 300 people each week.The 
 greens were built in 1924 and have    
 seen few changes.Suprisingly,rain does
 not affect the greens.Due to a sandy  
 base they dry quickly.The whole area  
 is roughly 12 acres.
