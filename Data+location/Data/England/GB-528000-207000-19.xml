		<title>19Bayford/L'B'std _ Houses</title>
		<content>  In both villages the houses are      
 concentrated on one main road, and    
 although there is a mixture of styles,
 the main materials used have been{red 
{brick and tiles,}old or new.Slate     
 roofs are uncommon.There is a good    
 deal of relatively modern built       
 housing,built in traditional style.   
   Of particular interest in L'B'sted  
 is a row of clap-board and brick built
 cottages,with tiled roofs,{over 300   
{years old.}We were shown the low oak  
 beams inside, and told that remains of
 earlier thatching had been found.     
   In Bayford, next to the pub, can be 
 seen a{late 16C pair of cottages,}one 
 in need of renovation. The low door   
 ways and the tall 17C chimney are     
 distinctive.Near the church are six,  
 originally thatched and one storey,   
 cottages, over 200 years old.
