		<content> Uffington School was built in 1848 by 
 The Earl of Lindsey. Recently an      
 extension of cloakroom and toilets was
 built and two mobile classrooms were  
 sited in the play ground. The school  
 uses an adjacent playing field. There 
 are 43 pupils aged 4-11 years with two
 full time and one part time teacher. A
 secretary comes in for 7 hours each   
 week and she shares lunch times super-
 vision with the caretaker.All children
 bring packed lunches as no hot meals  
 are provided.Twelve children are trans
 ported from Tallington.The adjoining  
 school house used to be occupied by   
 the Headmistress but it is now rented 
 by a Stamford teacher.Parents are en- 
 couraged to help out and close contact
 is kept with the church.The Rector    
 regularly visits school and the child-
 ren take part in church services and  
 perform a concert there each Christmas</content>
