  I came because I was left a small    
  cottage which I decided to use as    
  a 2nd home. My father and I enjoyed  
  living here so much that we decided  
  to stay here permanently. Being near 
  to the hills and the beauty of the   
  country_side and the ease of supply- 
  ing our homely needs all helped us   
  in our decision to stay here.        
                                       
                                       
          {Mother.                     
            {                          
  I was born here then I left to go to 
  college and get married and set up a 
  home. I came back here about five    
  years ago because my parents were    
  getting old. We like the area because
  of the country-side and having grown 
  up here I know lots of people.       </content>
