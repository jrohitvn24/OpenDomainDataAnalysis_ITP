		<title>17WATH BY-PASS</title>
		<content> Wath{by-pass}is being built to cut    
 down the traffic in the town centre,  
 especially around the Montgomery      
 roundabout. It is being built at the  
 north of the town on the site of an   
 old disused canal. The cost will be   
 around 1.2 million pounds. The road is
 approx. 1.2 km. long and is 7.3 metres
 wide. The actual depth of the road is 
 850 cm., this is made up of 550m.m. of
 limestone and 300m.m. of bitumen.     
 Because it was built on the old canal,
 some of the ground was very boggy - so
 a rock blanket foundation had to be   
 laid. Several properties had to be    
 knocked down for the new road, and an 
 old bridge over the canal, which is   
 now the sight of a new roundabout.
