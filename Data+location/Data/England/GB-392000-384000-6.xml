		<content>    The farm buildings, which date back
 to the 17th century, are near the site
 of the old{Norbury Hall manor house.  
 The farm itself goes back to the 13th 
 century. Mr.Cartwright,the present    
 owner, has farmed there for forty     
 years. There is a 30ft deep well      
 behind the farmhouse and the beams in 
 one of the barns are timbers from an  
 old galleon. He has 25 acres and grows
 market garden produce. One of his     
 specialities is rhubarb. He sells     
 direct to the public from the farm and
 does not market his produce.  He      
 keeps 2 horses and uses good animal   
 manure to grow his crops. Seedlings   
 are grown in sterilized soil, sand and
 grit. He spends most of his time      
 pricking out in the greenhouse. Plants
 are then put in the fields. 40cms     
 apart,190 per row. There are 3 farm   
 cottages,but the family do the farming</content>
