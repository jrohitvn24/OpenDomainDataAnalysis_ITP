		<content> Mrs Roadnight has lived at the Priory 
 which is the headquarters of the six  
 farms on the 2000 acre estat, for 49  
 years.  The estate has a 1000 acres of
 cereal which are mainly heat and      
 baley.  They grow 4603 tons of grain a
 year.  They also grow 4603 tons of    
 grain a year.  They also grow oil seed
 rape and rye grass.  Mrs Roadnight has
 550 breding sows and 120 sheep.  Each 
 sow produces a litter of about eight  
 piglets twice a year.  The pigs eat   
 grass cereal an sow biscuits.  About  
 Â£1/4 million is spent on pig food a   
 year.  Eihteen people are employed    
 fall time on the farm. At harvest time
 six extra students are employed       
 because it is the busiest time of the 
 year.
