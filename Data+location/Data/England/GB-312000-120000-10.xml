		<content> Rockwell Green is on the westerly     
 outskirts of Wellington.It is situated
 on ground under which there is reputed
 to be much water.Certainly a few years
 ago the local water came from the Bore
 Holes.There are 3 Nurseries in this   
 area which get their supply of water  
 from the Bore Holes.These are flower  
 nurseries,mainly Chrysanthemums.Large 
 greenhouses are very evident on the   
 local landscape.                      
  The village has its own Church,Church
 Hall,Village Hall &amp; Primary School V.C
  It also has a Post Office,Launderette
 ,2 Village Stores,a Hairdressers,an   
 Antiques Shop,2 Butchers and a        
 Fish'n'Chip Take-away.
