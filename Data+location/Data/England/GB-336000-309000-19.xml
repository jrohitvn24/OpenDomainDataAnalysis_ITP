		<title>19A Wildlife Area.</title>
		<content>  Our school had a grant from{Shell}to 
 make a wildlife area,which we called  
{Little Brook Furlong.}Mr.Hooper,who   
 owns the Grange old people's home,lent
 us some of his garden and we have used
 it to make a large pond.Mr.Fowles borr
 -owed a J.C.B. and dug the hole for us
 one wet Saturday morning.On Monday all
 the children carried newspapers and   
 old carpets down to line it.Then we   
 rolled the lining down and Mr.Phillips
 helped us spread it out.The pond was  
 filled by the firemen.They pumped in  
 about{17,800}litres of water.We left  
 it to settle over the holiday,as crea-
 tures don't like chlorine in water.   
 Then we put in water plants and frog- 
 spawn.So far,we have found{nine diff- 
{erent species}in our pond,including a 
 fierce looking horse leech.We have al-
 so put in lots of plants to attract   
 butterflies and other creatures.      </content>
