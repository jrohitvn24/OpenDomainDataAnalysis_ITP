		<content>   The nearest shops to our house are  
 either in Appledore or Hamstreet      
 villages. I usually shop at the VG    
 stores in Hanstreet during the week(VG
 means Village Grocers). However, my   
 big shopping once a week is done at   
 Sainsburys Supermarket in Ashford. I  
 am very lucky as my husband does this 
 for me as he is in Ashford and it     
 saves me time and petrol.             
   We usually purchase fresh meat each 
 week from Supermarket which I then put
 into the freezer to be used as        
 required. Most of our food is         
 purchased from the Supermarket except 
 for fresh vegetables, eggs and milk.  
 The milk is delivered to the door by  
 our milkman who calls every day. The  
 eggs and vegetables are usually       
 purchased from the VG or from a lady  
 who runs a smallholding just down the 
 road.These are stored in my fridge.   </content>
