		<content>     There are approximately 10 acres  
of field surrounded by woodland. There 
is a football pitch.                   
     There is a small park which has a 
climbing frame, spinning top, three    
swings a slide and a see-saw.          
     Next to the park is a bowling     
green.                                 
     There is quite a large car park.  
     There are two large buildings used
for discos or other entertainment. One 
is the Kinver Community Association    
Hall and the other is the British      
Legion. There is also the Senior       
Citizens Club.                         
     Along the edge run the River Stour
and the Staffordshire and              
Worcestershire Canal where you can     
fish.
