		<title>01CUCKFIELD RURAL</title>
		<content> This area, situated between the Forest
 Ridge and the South Downs comprises   
 mostly farmland.It is crossed by      
 several lanes and minor roads,and by  
 two B class roads,Staplefield to Cuck-
 field and Balcombe to Cuckfield. The  
 river Ouse,about three metres wide    
 here,crosses this part of Sussex and  
 eventually reaches the sea at         
 Newhaven.This is a pleasant and popul-
 ar residential district,being mid-way 
 between London and the South Coast,and
 six miles from Crawley New Town,with  
 its modern shops and industrial sites.
 There is one small village called     
 Brook Street where there is a large   
 workshop for the repair and           
 maintainace of cars and farm machinery
 As well as cultivated fields and graz-
 ing land,trees are quite numerous,    
 mostly oak,beech,ash and conifers.
