		<content> The hobbies and pastimes of an 11 year
 old girl in 1985.                     
     I think the thing I enjoy most is 
 playing "Rounders" with my friends. I 
 like collecting different rubbers and 
 soaps.I enjoy reading, and read quite 
 alot at night, but do not read much   
 during the daytime.                   
      I quite like playing the piano, I
 play at home and a teacher comes to my
 house to teach me each Tuesday for    
 half an hour. I enjoy going on bike   
 rides and having picnics with my      
 friends. I look after our family pets,
 we have 2 guinea pigs, a dog and a    
 cat.I love animals.                   
      I enjoy watching some television,
 I don't watch very much but every week
 on a Wednesday I make sure I watch    
 "Dallas." Also I like listening to pop
 music on the radio.
