   The main buildings at Moor Farm are 
 the{house,}the{poultry sheds,}the     
{Dutch barn}(where the straw is        
 stored),the{garage/workshop}and the   
 old{original barns and stables.       
   As the farmer cares for             
{conservation,the original hedges and  
{ponds are still there,}which is fairly
 unusual in Lincolnshire.Mr.Johnson is 
 also going to plant out some trees    
 behind his house.                     
   This year's sugar beet was planted  
 on April 15th.It is the{old tradition 
 that,by the day of the Lincolnshire   
 Show,all the sugar beet in the rows   
 should have their leaves touching.This
 has not happened in 1985.It has been  
 cold and wet and the crops are 3 to 4 
 weeks behind.
