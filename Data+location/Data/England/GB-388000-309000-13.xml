		<content> TRANSPORT                             
   The availability of public transport
 in this area is very limited.Because  
 of this most people have a car.The    
 nearest railway station is at         
 Penkridge,so not many people travel by
 train.                                
   Bus services do run through our     
 area.Service 5 runs from Cannock to   
 Telford stopping at 12 stops.Two of   
 them are Brewood and Gailey.These run 
 on Thursday only,one bus each         
 way.Services 877/878 both run through 
 our area,3 buses each way from Monday 
 to Saturday.This service is called the
 Green Bus Service.                    
   People travel for many reasons.Some 
 are shopping,work and lesiure.But     
 strangely there are not many petrol   
 stations in the area.There are only 2.
 Both are on the A5.One at Gailey and  
 one at the top of Horsebrook Lane.    </content>
