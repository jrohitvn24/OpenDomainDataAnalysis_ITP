		<title>08LUDLOW MAY FAIR</title>
		<content> There has been a May fair in Ludlow   
 since it was granted as a right in the
 Charter of Incorporation in 1461.It   
 became a Funfair in the middle of the 
 19th century and has always been held 
 in the streets of the town.           
   There are such rides as the         
 Waltzers,Dodgem cars,Octopus and Big  
 Wheel costing about 30p to 50p for a 3
 minute ride.Various side-shows and    
 foodstalls add to the whole           
 atmosphere.                           
   The fair stays for 3 days,including 
 May 1st. causing much confusion and   
 upheaval in the town. Local           
 tradespeople have tried repeatedly to 
 remove it from the streets without    
 success.The May fair is here to stay  
 and enjoyed by many ..... young and   
 old.
