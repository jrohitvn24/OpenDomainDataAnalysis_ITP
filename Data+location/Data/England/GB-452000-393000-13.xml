		<title>13Braithwell Parish Council</title>
		<content> The first meeting of Braithwell Parish
 Council was held on the 14th December,
 1894. The Parish includes the villages
 of Braithwell and Micklebring. Untill 
 1st April, 1974 it came under the     
 jurisdiction of Doncaster Rural       
 District Council, but since has been  
 responsible to Doncaster Metropolitan 
 Borough Council. There are five Parish
 Councillors and a Clerk. Meetings are 
 normally held on the last Wednesday of
 each month and must be advertised in  
 a prominent place in the Parish at    
 least three days before a meeting.    
 Minutes of proceedings are kept and   
 signed by the chairman after the      
 Council are satisfied as to their     
 accuracy. Parish funds are obtained in
 the form of a Parish precept by       
 agreeing a Parish rate. Braithwell    
 Parish Council tries to evoke public  
 interest in Parish &amp; Local Government.</content>
