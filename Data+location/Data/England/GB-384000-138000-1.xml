		<title>01Introduction: the Deverills</title>
		<content> This area is part of what is known  as
{the Deverill Valley.}It includes three
 of five villages bearing the name     
 Deverill,{Longbridge, Hill and Brixton
{Deverill.}At the time of the{Domesday 
{Book}there were nine 'Devral 'villages
 They took their name from the Deverill
 stream which feeds the head-waters of 
 the{River Wylye.}They lie along its   
 lovely valley as the river meanders   
 through a landscape of rounded chalk  
 hills. The chalk upland reaches 845   
 feet at{Cold Kitchen Hill}and the land
 is nowhere below 400 feet.It is still 
 an almost purely agricultural area of 
 cereal crops and grass, sheep and     
 cattle.Though the old sluice-gates are
 no longer opened to flood the water   
 meadows in the Spring, the Trout Farm 
 and Cress Farm still reflect the      
 importance of water in a valley whose 
 name derives from a Celtic stream name</content>
