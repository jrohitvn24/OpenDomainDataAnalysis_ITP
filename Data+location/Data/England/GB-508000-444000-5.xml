		<content> Our Doctors'  surgery is very         
 interesting. until 1977 it was the    
 village police station. In past years 
 there had been a Petty Session court  
 held there. There were 3 cells a      
 magistrates' room, a witness room     
 and a small ante-room. There were also
 rooms for the police inspector and    
 constables and a prisoners' exercise  
 yard.                                 
  In 1979 it was converted into our    
 surgery. It is unusual, as the old    
 court room is now our waiting room    
 and if you need treatment or          
 injections these are given in rooms   
 which were once the cells. The        
 tretment rooms have small barred      
 windows and the ceilings are low &amp;    
 rounded. As we are a country practice 
 we do not have to go to a chemist for 
 our medicines but get them at the     
 surgery dispensary.                   </content>
