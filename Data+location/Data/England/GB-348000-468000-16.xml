 The people in the village own the     
 village hall. There is no special     
 owner. The village hall is situated on
 Show Lane, straight across from the   
 village green. There are many weekly  
 activities such as brownies,          
 playgroups, youth clubs, cubs and     
 scouts and the Women's Institute meet 
 once a month.  All this is{recreation.
 The occasional activities that occur  
 are family nights, parties, discos and
 barbecues.  The village green sees    
 many activities. Lots of exciting     
 events take place there including     
 Field Day, pancake races, sports day, 
 rounders rallies and lots more.  On   
 Field Day most of the children dress  
 up and the Nether Kellet Queen rides  
 on a float with two attendants and a  
 page boy.  She is crowned on the      
 village green.                        </content>
