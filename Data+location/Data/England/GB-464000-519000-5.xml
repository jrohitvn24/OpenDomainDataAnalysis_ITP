		<title>05SALTBURN:LEISURE FACILITIES.</title>
		<content> Saltburn and Skelton are well equipped
 with leisure facilities with Saltburn 
 having most of them. Excluding the    
 leisure centre there is a golf course,
 BMX track, Cricket Club, Youth Hostel,
 Football pitches, Tennis Club, Riding 
 Stables, Bowls and recreational parks.
 We interviewed 43 people of both sexes
 whose ages ranged from 10 to over 60. 
 Most people using the centre came from
 nearby places such as Marske, Skelton,
 Redcar and Guisborough. The rest lived
 in Saltburn. The most used facility at
 the centre is the swimming pool       
 followed by badminton. Other sports   
 include weight training, gymnastics,  
 squash, indoor bowls, scuba diving and
 canoeing. Saltburn &amp; Marske Swimming  
 Club are also based at the centre.    
 Improvements could include all day    
 opening, a bigger pool, diving boards,
 wave machines and an indoor BMX track.</content>
