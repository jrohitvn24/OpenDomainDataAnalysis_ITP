		<title>19St.Luke's Church,Endon.</title>
		<content>       The parish of Endon with Stanley
is in the diocese of Lichfield.Prior to
1730,when St.Luke's Church was founded,
deceased people from Endon had to be   
taken to Leek for burial.Five years ago
the parishioners of the village were   
able to celebrate the 250th anniversary
of the church.To commemorate this event
a Chapter House was built adjoining the
church. It is used as a meeting place  
and as a venue for the Sunday School.  
       Most of the delightful hassocks 
in the church have been hand stitched  
by ladies in local organisations.      
       The church still contains four  
very large brass paraffin lamps and    
their shades, left in their original   
positions attached to brackets on the  
sides of the pillars. Today the church 
is lit by electricity.
