		<title>18TRAFFIC SURVEY RESULTS</title>
		<content> THE RESULTS OF THE SURVEY SHOWED THAT:
 1.THERE WERE 140 COMMERCIAL VEHICLES  
 USING DORCHESTER ROAD EVERY HOUR.     
 2.THERE WERE 44 PUBLIC TRANSPORT      
 VEHICLES EVERY HOUR.                  
 3.THERE WERE 700 PRIVATE VEHICLES     
 EVERY HOUR.                           
 4.IN ALL CASES LOCAL VEHICLES WERE    
 OUTNUMBERED BY VEHICLES REGISTERED OUT
 SIDE THE LOCAL AREA - IT WAS ASSUMED  
 THAT THE MAJORITY OF THESE WERE       
 CARRYING HOLIDAYMAKERS.               
 THE ORIGINAL NOTION THAT THE          
 DORCHESTER ROAD WAS THE BUSIEST       
 ROADWAY IN THE AREA IS BORNE OUT BY   
 THESE RESULTS.                        
 AS THE WHOLE REGION IS A VERY POPULAR 
 TOURIST AREA IT IS NOT SURPRISING THAT
 VISITORS TRANSPORT SHOULD OUTNUMBER   
 THAT OF THE LOCALS IN THE SUMMER      
 SEASON.                               
                                       </content>
