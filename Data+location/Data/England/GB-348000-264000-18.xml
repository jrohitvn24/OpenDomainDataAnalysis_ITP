		<title>18   THE VILLAGE OF EYE</title>
		<content>{Eye,}as its name suggests, is on an   
 island of land formed by two streams. 
 The word Eye or Ey was the{Saxon}word 
 for water and is frequently used      
 either alone or as a prefix to        
 designate places located in low       
{situations.Eye Manor}was built in 1680
 for Ferdinado Gorges, a Barbados slave
 trader. It is not very special from   
 the outside but inside it is          
 beautiful. Its ceilings have some of  
 the richest decoration in the country.
 One mile away is{Berrington Hall,     
 built for{Thomas Harley.}It was built 
 by Henry Holland in 1778-81 and the   
 park laid out by{Capability Brown.    
 Harley had been Lord Mayor of London. 
 He is buried in the little church at  
 Eye. This is dark with many arches and
 small windows. It also has many tombs 
 and memorials making it rather a      
 dismal place.                         </content>
