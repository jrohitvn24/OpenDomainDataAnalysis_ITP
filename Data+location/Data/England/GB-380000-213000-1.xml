		<content>  Being part of the Vale of Gloucester,
 on the east bank of the River Severn, 
 much of the area is flat, but 4km from
 the river is Robinswood Hill, which   
 rises sharply to 630ft.               
  Tuffley forms the southern extremity 
 of Gloucester, and much of it was     
 developed between the late 1950's and 
 the 1970's.                           
  It has a popular residential area,   
 well served with shops, schools,      
 churches, medical services,           
 recreational facilities and bus       
 services.                             
  Until the 1970's Quedgeley was a     
 quiet Severn-side village. Rapid      
 development has transformed it into a 
 vast residential area, but still      
 outside the city.                     
  Tiny Whaddon, however, has remained  
 unaffected by such changes so far.
