  Welsh Mountain ponies have been on   
 the hills of Wales since the beginning
 of time and are now becoming more     
 popular in other parts of the country.
 Most Welsh Mountain ponies are grey,  
 but some of them are white.Arabs      
 brought their ponies to Wales and bred
 them,with their ponies,and so the     
 colour of the Welsh Mountain pony     
 changed its coat from dark to light.  
  These ponies do not have to be shod  
 because they are not ridden,but they  
 need to have their hooves clipped.    
 They must not be more than 12 hands   
 high.They are fed on grass in winter. 
 Summer grazing is limited to prevent  
 Laminitis.                            </content>
