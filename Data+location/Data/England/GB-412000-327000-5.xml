		<content> The small amount of employment within 
 the block is mainly from farming, road
 haulage, domestic and social work.    
 There is an industrial estate which   
 contains warehouses and workshops.    
                                       
 There are 2 road haulage firms, one of
 them (Bucks Transport) employs about  
 160 people.  The other is named after 
 the village _ just think, next time   
 you see a lorry  with{DRAYCOTT}written
 on it, it comes from our village.     
                                       
 Most people commute into Burton upon  
 Trent or one of the other nearby      
 towns. The main sources of employment 
 are the breweries, the food industry  
 and the Gypsum mine.                  
                                       
 Unemployment is probably lower than   
 in the local towns.
