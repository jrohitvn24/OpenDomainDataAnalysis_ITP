		<content> On the western side of Mounts Bay     
 between Newlyn and Mousehole is a     
 well -known anchoring place called    
 Gwavas Lake.                          
 Where the sea is now there used to    
 be a forest. In the middle of the     
 forest was a lake.                    
 A hermit lived beside the lake and    
 many people visited his oratory       
 because they felt that his prayers    
 and the waters of the lake would      
 cure their ills.                      
 But at some point the forest was      
 flooded and everything submerged.     
 Those who survived built another      
 church and dedicated it to the        
 saint of the lake,St.Pol or St.       
 Paul.                                 
 This flood separated the Isles of     
 Scilly from the mainland. .
