 Mr. Girling has lived in the same     
 house for nearly 50 years. He         
 remembers the houses on the main road 
 being the only ones to have mains     
 water, electricity and sewers.        
 In 1936 there were very few cars but a
 good bus service and the road was     
 covered in asphalt. Today there are   
 few buses but very heavy car and lorry
 traffic which means the tarmac road is
 always being repaired.                
 Behind the main road very little has  
 changed. The same families farm the   
 land, but the labourers were Irish,   
 then Breton, now Portuguese. No       
 tomatoes now, but more cereal is grown
 on the cotils. The few cows are now   
 milked by machine.                    
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
