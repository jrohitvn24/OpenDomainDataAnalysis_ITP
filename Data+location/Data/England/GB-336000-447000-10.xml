		<title>10Industry-Salt</title>
		<content> Rock salt was first discovered at map 
 ref 03610472 in 1872 by engineers from
 Barrow looking for haematite.It       
 occupies a large lens 800' to 1200'   
 below surface within Keuper Marl.At   
 first brine from the surface of the   
 deposit was pumped up and piped across
 the bed of the Wyre to the Fleetwood  
 Salt Co. at Burn Naze.This was stopped
 in 1891 due to the land subsidence    
 when the unsupported Keuper Marl      
 collapsed.These water filled Flashes  
 are numerous,some are dangerously     
 deep.For a short time brine was pumped
 from the bottom of the deposit but    
 this was not economic.In 1893 deep    
 mining began (map ref.036204779).     
 There were 2 levels, each mining 22'  
 of salt from passages at right angles 
 to each other, with large square      
 pillars left for roof support.
