		<title>12BADMINTON IN RISELEY</title>

      When Riseley Village Hall was    
 built it was designed to incorporate a
 badminton court.  No sooner had       
 building been completed than at least 
 4 clubs were formed.  To date there   
 are 7 clubs, of varying standards,    
 which include Ladies Doubles and Mixed
 Doubles Clubs.  Three of the clubs    
 have teams competing in the Rushden   
 and District League with varying      
 degrees of success. Playing members   
 come mainly from Riseley and a few    
 from neighbouring villages.  Each club
 consists of roughly 20 members and    
 several people play for more than one 
 club. Badminton is played on 4 days of
 the week during both mornings and     
 evenings.  It is felt that without the
 fees from the clubs the Village Hall  
 would not be able to run as           
 efficiently as it does.               </content>
