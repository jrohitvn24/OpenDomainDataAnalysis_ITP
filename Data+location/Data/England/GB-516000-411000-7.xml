		<title>07Changes in Stallingborough</title>
		<content> Stallingborough used to have a mill.  
 It ground corn for flour for the      
 villagers but now it is a house.The   
 station has also changed.Steam trains 
 would take people or goods to market. 
 Diesels have replaced these trains    
 because they are faster and cleaner if
 not so frequent.Springs provided the  
 villager's water supply but new       
 factories have taken all the water and
 the springs have dried up.These       
 factories created work for people.    
 There used to be work on the farms    
 round Sallingborough.Mechanization is 
 the force behind all these changes.The
 evidence for this is the village      
 traffic.Over the years the roads have 
 got busier people owning their own    
 cars.There are also lorries travelling
 to and from the factories. This has   
 spoilt the quiet rural atmosphere of  
 the village.                          </content>
