		<title>19SHOPS IN THE COMMUNITY</title>
		<content>   We have approximately 8400 people in
 our area. To serve our community we   
 have{5 general-food stores}and 2 are  
{sub-post offices}as well,{2           
{hairdressers, 1 fish and chips shop,  
 and{1 bakery.}The general stores found
 that their busiest times were 9.00    
 a.m and 4.00 p.m when  children are   
 going to and from school.             
   Local shops are very necessary for  
{all ages}of the community especially  
{old people}who need sub-post offices  
 for their state pensions. The shops   
 are very handy for a person to buy    
 their weekly shopping or for something
 they have forgotten or run out of.    
 They are very popular with{children,  
 as the selection of sweets is far     
 greater than in supermarkets. The     
 majority of the community feel that   
 more shops are not needed as they are 
 well catered for.                     </content>
