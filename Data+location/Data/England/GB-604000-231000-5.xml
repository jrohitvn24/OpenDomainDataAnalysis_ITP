 Much of Dedham is a Conservation Area.
 This means that the area is protected 
 from development as much as possible. 
 You have to ask the council for       
 permission to cut-down,uproot or lop a
 tree.You give them six weeks notice of
 your intentions and if they object    
 then you cannot proceed.If a tree is  
 dead,dying or dangerous then you can  
 cut them down but replace them.       
 Buildings are protected, Grade 3      
 listed buildings are mostly built     
 between 1700 and 1840. Grade 2 are    
 historical buildings built before 1700
 provided they havent changed too much.
 Grade 1 are the most important        
 buildings of great historical         
 interest. To change them you must ask 
 the Minister of the Environment.
