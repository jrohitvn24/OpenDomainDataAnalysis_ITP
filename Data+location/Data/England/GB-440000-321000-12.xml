		<title>12Breedon Community Council</title>
		<content>    The Community Council has a major  
 role in the life of Breedon and its'  
 people. The council is made up of     
 various people who want to help       
 Breedon. The council was formed when  
 the new school was built in 1963. The 
 people wanted somewhere to meet and   
 for recreational purposes as well as a
 new school. So a meeting resulted in  
 the village and the County Council    
 combining monies to build the school  
 and a community centre.               
    The Community Council fosters good 
 relationships with all affilliated    
 bodies who use the community centre.  
 These affilliated groups all have     
 representatives on the committee.     
    The Community Council meet once a  
 month. They arrange interesting events
 like dances, whist drives and other   
 social activities for the local       
 people.                               </content>
