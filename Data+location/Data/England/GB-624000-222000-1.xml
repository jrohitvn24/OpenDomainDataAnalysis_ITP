		<content> Walton is a small seaside resort that 
 with its neighbour Frinton became well
 known in the early part of the        
 century,attracting many Londoners to  
 the fine beaches.This particular area 
 of Walton is better known for the     
 Naze,an outcrop of the Red Crag which 
 contains many unusual fossils and for 
 its fine walks and views over rolling 
 moorload.The backwaters are a haven   
 for birds and sailors alike and also a
 wide range of plants and flowers can  
 be found.The members of classes 5 and 
 6 of Walton County Primary School have
 enjoyed taking part in the survey and 
 hope that you will visit our small    
 corner of the country and find it as  
 interesting as we have.
