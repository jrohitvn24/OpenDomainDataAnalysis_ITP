		<content> THIS IS A{CONSERVATION}AREA AND SOME  
 OF THE LAND IS INCLUDED IN THE        
 NATIONAL PARK.  TREES ARE IMPORTANT   
 AND WELL SCATTERED OVER THE AREA      
 ALTHOUGH ELM TREE DISEASE HAS TAKEN   
 ITS TOLL.  SEVERAL PLANTATIONS IN THE 
 AREA ARE MAINLY CONIFERS BUT FRINGED  
 BY A VARIETY OF DECIDUOUS TREES ABOVE 
 BLACK CARTS SOME 300 HARDWOOD TREES   
 HAVE BEEN PLANTED TO ENCOURAGE WILD   
 LIFE.  THE MAIN ROADS HAVE WIDE GRASS 
 VERGES WHICH CONTAIN A GOOD VARIETY OF
 FLOWERS AND ALTHOUGH THE QUARRY AT    
 HEATHERIDGE IS DRY, IT IS RAPIDLY     
 BECOMING COLONISED BY SMALL TREES AND 
 SHRUBS.  SOME{FOOTPATHS}TEND TO BE    
 OVERGROWN WITH A LARGE VARIETY OF     
 GRASSES AND PLENTY OF WILD FLOWERS.   
 NOT SO MANY{BIRDS}ABOUT; PIGEONS IN   
 THE PLANTATION, ROOKS ON THE FIELDS   
 AND A FLUTTERING OF SMALL BIRDS IN THE
 HEDGES.                               </content>
