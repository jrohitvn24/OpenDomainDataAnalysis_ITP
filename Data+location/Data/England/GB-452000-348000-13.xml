		<title>13A DAY IN THE LIFE OF...</title>
		<content> The day starts at 4.30, I wash and eat
 breakfast. 5.15-I leave for work on my
 Honda C90.5.25-clock-on and put my    
 works motly on the board . This tells 
 the manager who is available for work.
 As a colliery winder I have to check  
 that the engine is in working order   
 and any problems have been rectified  
 with the night shift. I check all the 
 safety devices and have a cup of tea  
 with the banksman. The electric winder
 has a 500hp GEC engine able to lift 6 
 tonnes 68 times an hour. The onsetter 
 in the pit bottom loads the coal. The 
 banksman empties it, the process being
 fully automated. Coal winding takes   
 place from 7.30 to the 10.40 break.   
 The next shift takes over at 13.30.   
 Today we have lifted 2640 tonnes,1300 
 tonnes of saleable coal. An uneventful
 day except for the slight overheating 
 of a bearing.                         </content>
