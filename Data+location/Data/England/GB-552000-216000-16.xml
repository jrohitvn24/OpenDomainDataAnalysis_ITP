		<content>{    Life in the village as seen       
{      by an eleven year girl.         
   One advantage of living in the      
 country is that there is much less    
 traffic and therefore it is much      
 quieter; but there are lots of        
 disadvantages as well. I think the    
 main one is that because it is such a 
 small village there are not many      
 shops.                                
   My usual day goes like this: get up 
 at 8 am, get dressed into my school   
 uniform which consists of blue jumper,
 blue skirt, blue or white shirt, white
 socks and black lace-up shoes (they're
 in fashion!) and go down to breakfast 
 at about 8.15 am. I always have       
 branflakes, never cornflakes, which I 
 would prefer sometimes for a change!  
 At 8.55 am approximately I leave home 
 to go to school.{Continued on page 17.
