		<title>02Farming Facts, Horse-Eye</title>
		<content> Although Horse-Eye Level is used      
 mainly for grazing, a few drained     
 fields grow cereals. Hay and Straw    
 Bales used for animal feed &amp; bedding  
 are a small feature of the area. The  
 changing shape of the bale is of a    
 little interest. The early small round
 bale was changed to a small rectangle.
 This, however, became a fire hazard &amp; 
 also soaked up the rain water. So now 
 they have reverted to a round shape   
 once more, though larger &amp; the rain   
 just rolls off. Another changing face 
 of farming is the increased use of    
 black plastic &amp; old tyres as clamps   
 for storage of hay, straw, silage etc.
 The 4 privately owned freehold farms  
 are worked by owner or tenant farmers.
 There are 3 silage towers in this     
 area. A serious pollution problem     
 growing in this area is the discarded 
 plastic fertilizer bags in the hedges.</content>
