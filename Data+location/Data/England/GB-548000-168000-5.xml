		<content> Within approximatly two kilometres    
radius of Swanley centre are five      
primary schools,four infant schools and
four junior schools.There is a very    
happy working association amongst them.
There are regular meetings of head     
 teachers,music teachers and sports    
teachers.Teams of                      
footballers,netballers and rounders    
players have regular inter-school      
matches.There is an annual swimming gal
,and athletics meeting and a music     
festival. The theme is always          
co-oparation. No scores are added to   
find a winning school,then there are no
losers.                                
  Most children transfer to either of  
the two comprehensive schools in the   
area,Swanley and Hextable.             
  The friendly association amongst     
Swanley area schools is often          
complemented by visitors.              </content>
