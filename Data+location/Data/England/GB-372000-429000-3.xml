  The area is quite well catered for by
its 21 public houses and other licensed
premises such as hotels and working    
men's clubs. There are many interesting
names of pubs. The Volunteers Arms     
relates to the old use of pubs as      
enlistment centres, whilst the Albion  
was the old Roman and Greek name for   
England. The Hare and Hounds and The   
Greyhound are linked with the once     
popular 'sport' of coursing. The       
Walmesley Arms pays deference to the   
Dunkenhalgh family whilst the Forts    
Arms is linked with a local family of  
calico printers. The Oddfellows Arms   
recalls the friendly society of that   
name - an organisation which met in    
this and many other pubs in the area.
