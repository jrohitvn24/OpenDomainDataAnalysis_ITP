		<title>13       OSEA ISLAND</title>
		<content> Osea island is situated in the Black- 
 water estuary. It is connected to the 
 mainland by a causeway which is under 
 water at high tide.                   
   The island used to belong to the    
 brewers,Charringtons,but now it       
 belongs to Cambridge University.The   
 University employs a Farm Manager to  
 look after the island                 
   Out of 320 acres 200 acres are under
 cultivation - mostly cereal crops.The 
 remaining 120 acres are mainly salt-  
 marsh.                                
   Holidaymakers can rent some of the  
 houses on the island and it was partly
 to make it more interesting for them  
 that animals began to be kept. There  
 is now a flock of about 90 sheep as   
 well as some pigs.                    
   There are also pheasants,partridges,
 guinea fowl and peacocks on Osea.
