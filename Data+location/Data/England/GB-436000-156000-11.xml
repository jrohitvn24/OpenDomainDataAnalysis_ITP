		<title>11FARMING IN THE AREA</title>
		<content> The gently undulating terrain lends   
 itself to succesful farming.          
 Crops are oats, barley and wheat for  
 harvest in July to August, followed by
 a catch crop of stubble turnips to    
 feed sheep                            
 in early Spring when the large flocks 
 from both estates are lambing. Some   
 lambs are fattened and sent to        
 slaughter. Others are sold as store   
 lambs to be fattened elsewhere. Ewes  
 are at the end of their commercial    
 viability after 6 or 7 years. Shearing
 is done by contractors (often         
 Australians or New Zealanders who     
 travel around the country) during May 
 and June.                             
 Dipping against sheep scab and maggots
 is compulsory in summer and autumn. A 
 Ministry of Agriculture inspector     
 should be present to verify the       
 dipping is done correctly.            </content>
