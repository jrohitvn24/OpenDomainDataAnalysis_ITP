		<title>17LOWER FORGE</title>
		<content>{ Lower Forge}is a small hamlet of     
 about{10 stone cottages.}It lies on   
 the western bank of the{River Severn, 
 at the end of a steep mud track. As   
 the name implies the hamlet was once  
 the site of old iron workings. The    
 remains of the forge can now be seen  
 together with the 10 metre high       
 chimney. The forge is now{overgrown   
 with follage, which makes it hard to  
 see from the river.                   
  Life at the hamlet is{very quiet,    
 where the population do their own     
 thing. Most people have lived at the  
 forge for about 40 years and are now  
 getting on in age. The houses are{not 
 generaly{in good condition}as it is   
 felt apperances do not matter, like in
 a housing estate. For the{young life  
 in the forge is considered as         
{"boring".                             
                                       </content>
