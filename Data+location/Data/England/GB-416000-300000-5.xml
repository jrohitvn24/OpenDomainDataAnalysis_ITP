		<content>Mile Oak is a village on the A5        
consisting of a farm,some isolated     
houses, a few small firms and an       
estate. The remaining land is mostly   
farmland. The industry comprises of a  
transport business (coaches, minibuses 
and taxis), a road haulage business    
and firm dealing in glues and gums.    
To the traveller on the A5, Mile Oak is
a busy set of traffic lights with a    
garage on one corner and the Mile Oak  
pub on the opposite corner. This       
intersection between the A453          
(Tamworth-Birmingham) and the A5 is an 
accident black spot. Big changes are in
store for Mile Oak. A proposed A5      
diversion to by-pass Fazeley, Two Gates
and Wilnecote will leave the present   
course of the A5 here. A new hospital  
is also planned.
