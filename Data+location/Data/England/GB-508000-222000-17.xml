		<title>17A STOPSLEY SENIOR CITIZEN</title>
		<content> The gentleman I interviewed lives in  
 Stopsley and has done so for all his  
 life. He is seventy years old, is not 
 married and has no children, but he   
 does have a golden labrador dog which 
 he takes for a walk twice daily. He   
 does his shopping locally in the      
 'village'. He is now retired, but     
 until eight years ago, worked as a    
 newspaper printer. He says the village
 has changed a lot during his lifetime.
 A lot more shops have been built and  
 the roads widened. He says that       
 although a great deal of progress has 
 been made, he preferred the village as
 it used to be. There was a farm on the
 site of the present Jansell House and 
 a village pond across the road where  
 a garage now stands.                  
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
