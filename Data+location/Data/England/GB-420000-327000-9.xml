		<content>An 11 year old Rolleston boy           
On Sunday I get up at about 8.30am.    
and get ready to go to fellowship which
is like church yet different.When we   
get there we talk to people until      
someone starts to play a guitar and    
then the service begins.At 11.00a.m all
the young people go to the various     
groups like Sunday School creche.I have
a lot of fun at fellowship because we  
go on outings.                         
At 12.00.p.m.fellowship finishes and we
play on the swings outside until       
half-past,then we go home and have     
lunch.At1.45p.m.I call for my friend   
Gareth and play down the Brook or in my
garden until 5.00p.m then Gareth has to
go.Sometimes I play up my tree with my 
brother.Most Sunday evenings I watch   
television until 9.30p.m.then I go to  
bed.I read for half an hour then fall  
asleep.                                </content>
