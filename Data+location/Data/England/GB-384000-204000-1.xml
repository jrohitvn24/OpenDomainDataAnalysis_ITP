		<title>01DESCRIPTION OF STROUD</title>
		<content>  STROUD is a small town built on a    
 hillside and situated at the          
 confluence of five valleys.Its roads  
 climb steeply,and the surrounding     
 hills are used to feed the sheep that 
 brought Stroud its main industries,   
 first wool processing and later the   
 manufacture of textiles.The abundant  
 supply of water in the valleys was    
 suitable for treating the broadcloth  
 that became famous throughout Europe  
 particulary the "Stroud Scarlet" used 
 for uniforms,which is still produced  
 in a local mill.At one time there were
 many factories,mills and dyeworks     
 along the course of the River         
 Frome,but the cloth industry has      
 declined,but not ceased over the      
 years.Some mills have been demolished,
 but others have been taken over by    
 light industry,including engineering  
 and woodworking.                      </content>
