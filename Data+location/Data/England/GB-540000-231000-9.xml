		<title>09A Day in the Life of Peter.</title>
		<content> I usually get up at about 7 o'clock.I 
 have a breakfast of Bran Flakes and   
 clean my teeth with S.R.toothpaste.   
 I have asthma so then I take my       
 medicines.When I am ready for school I
 go in my dad's Nissan Silvia car.     
 School usually begins with maths or   
 english.We have assembly and playtime 
 and then perhaps recorders or P.E.    
 I have school dinner and then play    
 spot_ball with my friends until in    
 time.In the afternoon we do art,      
 games, topic work and have a story.   
 At 3.20 we go home, I switch on the   
 television until tea_time.After tea I 
 may play outside.I usually play       
 policemen with Rosanna and my         
 brothers.I help my dad with the       
 donkeys and then have a bath ready for
 bed.Dad reads me a story.I like the   
 one called 'He's Not Human'.I go to   
 sleep at about 7.30 as I am only 8.   </content>
