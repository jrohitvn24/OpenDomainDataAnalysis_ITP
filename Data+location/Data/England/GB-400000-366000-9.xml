		<title>09St.Paul's Church at Flash</title>
		<content> On the outside it says that it was    
 built in 1744 and it was rebuilt in   
 1901. A man called E.Y Ash built the  
 pulpit. He carved apples  and leaves  
 on it and, hidden among the apples,   
 there is a mouse. On a normal service 
 there are only 10 people. However, if 
 the church was full it would hold 200 
 people. The Beswick family gave the   
 stained glass windows to Flash church.
 The church asks for money for a boy   
 who is a spastic. He lives in Israel. 
                                       
                                       
 At the church they bury people and    
 sometimes people get married  and you 
 go to the church to think about God   
 and if you look at the windows there  
 are pictures of God.                  
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
