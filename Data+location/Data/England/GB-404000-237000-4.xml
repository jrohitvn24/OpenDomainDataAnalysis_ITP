		<title>04MONDAY IS MARKET DAY - 2</title>
		<content> Lunchtime already. After a morning    
 checking the animals I settle down to 
 lunch again to be disturbed. This time
 it's a rep. "Sorry my husband is at   
 market. I don't know what time he will
 be home, goodbye." Thank goodness for 
 the automatic washing machine. I hang 
 the washing on the line, start the    
 housework and prepare dinner. My      
 husband returns with a smile of       
 content, the stock sold well. After   
 dinner I take the tractor and trailer 
 to collect bales from the hayfield and
 return to the rickyard. I water the   
 plants in the greenhouse and pick the 
 raspberries. The dogs are waiting to  
 be fed, how pleased they are to see   
 me. After a busy and enjoyable day    
 it's 11.30pm and I am ready for my    
 bed.                                  
                                       
                                       </content>
