 On the morning of Tuesday,July 2nd    
 1985 I got ready for school.I         
 collected my swimming gear, my coat,  
 my lunch and then I set off.When I    
 arrived at school I hung up my coat   
 and bags in the cloakroom and walked  
 into the classroom.After a while it   
 was time to sit down so I did!        
 Mrs.Robertson who is my teacher called
 the register,we got out our hymn books
 and went into assembly in Classroom 2 
 where all the tables and chairs had   
 been moved out of the way as usual.It 
 was hymn practice so we sang a few of 
 our favourite hymns and then went back
 to our rooms. We did maths until break
 at 10.30 and afterwards carried on    
 with our Domesday project. At 11.50 we
 went for lunch in the New school hall 
 then we went out to play.             </content>
