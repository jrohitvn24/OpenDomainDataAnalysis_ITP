		<title>14 SHALDON - A TIDY VILLAGE?</title>
		<content>   While travelling around the area we 
took special note of the state of roads
and pavements. Most of the roads in the
Ringmore area were tarmaced as were the
pavements. As a result these surfaces  
were uneven and the pavements were     
difficult to walk on.                  
   We noticed that there were very few 
litter bins in Shaldon. In spite of    
this the village was virtually litter  
free. Many of the tourists in the area 
commented on this fact.                
   The only real litter in the area was
provided by the dog population who left
plenty of evidence of their prescence  
on the pavements and roads.            
   We came to the conclusion that the  
human populaton of Shaldon were on the 
whole a tidy group and if only the dog 
population could be likewise then      
Shaldon would be in the running for the
title of tidiest village in England.   </content>
