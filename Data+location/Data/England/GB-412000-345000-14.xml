		<title>14A Day in the Life of.....(4)</title>
		<content>.....MOTHER (Continued)                
We arrived home just in time for me to 
help load the car for another delivery.
It was now time to relax,welcome the   
eldest two boys home from school,and we
all reflected on the day we'd all had. 
Now it was time to prepare tea and keep
the peace between the various          
antagonists.After tea the boys helped  
by cleaning up and washing up whilst I 
read stories to the younger boys.By 8p.
m the three youngest were in bed and by
10p.m. the two older boys as well.It   
was now time to have a cup of coffee   
with my husband who had just finished  
his day's work.We might watch something
interesting on television or discuss   
any problems that may have surfaced    
during the day....And so to bed,before 
starting off on our daytime activities 
again.
