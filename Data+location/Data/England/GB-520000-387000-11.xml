		<content> Whilst only 20 % of Ludford is in this
 Grid area it contains several features
 vital to the Community _ Parish Church
 Primary School, a Public House, the   
 White Hart &amp; a Fish &amp; Chip Shop. The  
 village nestles in a dip on the top of
 the Wolds and despite an illusion of  
 trees, has few and is always open to  
 the winds. Within this part of the    
 village are 49 adults &amp; 13 children in
 25 households of which 17 are on the  
 telephone &amp; 20 have cars. No public   
 housing (Council Houses), all housing 
 being privately owned, some rented but
 the majority owner_occupied _ mixture 
 of old Farmhouses, Victorian and pre_ 
 W.W.I houses and cottages and about   
 30% modern post W.W.2. bungalows and  
 houses.
