		<title>19THE NURSERY PLAYGROUND</title>
		<content>  Near the Northend Road there is a    
 small nursery playground. This        
 playground is for children aged about 
 four to ten years. It has no          
 rubbish-bins and no caretaker. There  
 are not many things to play on, which 
 is not very interesting for children  
 of that age. There is a lot of rubbish
 lying on the ground such as glass,    
 crisp packets etc.. There are not many
 flowers so it is unattractive to      
 people passing by. We wrote to the    
 Council to desribe the state of the   
 playground and in two weeks time they 
 had swept it and planted flowers _ but
 there are still no litter-bins !
