		<content> Dunhampton and Gt Horton farms were   
 both old but Dunhampton had been      
 completely renovated and looked like a
 new house.The Gt Horton farm          
 house,however,was exactly the same as 
 it would have been 100 years ago.It   
 was also very comfortable and homely, 
 it had an open fire and the rooms were
 large and spacious.Both farms were    
 owned by companys,Gt Horton was owned 
 by Scottish Amiccable,an insurance    
 company which invests some of its     
 money in land and Dunhampton was owned
 by W.A.Sylvesters Ltd.a company       
 controlled by the farmers family.
