		<content> 1.My hobby is reading. I like reading 
 poetry the best. I have 50 books of   
 poems. I also like reading ghost      
 stories. I read a ghost story every   
 night. I read in my spare time when we
 are off school. The most I have read  
 in a day is 6 books.

{whenever I can. My mum has just bought
{me a new racket and a really good

{book the courts.

 3.I collect Key Rings and Rubbers. I  
 have 114 key rings. I have fur ones, a
 money one, a skate boot and lots more.
 I have 43 rubbers. I have a coca-cola,
 a flag, a hot-dog and many more which 
 I keep in a tin for safety. I have not
 used any of them.
