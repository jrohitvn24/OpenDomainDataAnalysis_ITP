 The Ecumenical Centre was opened in   
 June 1985. It was designed to bring   
 people together from different        
 religions and social backgrounds      
 through its function as a             
 neighbourhood centre. Playgoups,      
 community organisations, clubs, and   
 socials are held here. It is also used
 for prayer and worship. In this       
 capacity it is multi-denominational,  
 embracing C of E,                     
 Baptists,Congregationalists, United   
 Reformers, Methodists, and Free Church
 Christians. One part of the centre is 
 always open for public prayer. Built  
 at a cost of Â£320,000 and with a      
 capacity of 250 people this is a very 
 interesting fusion of religious and   
 social life.
