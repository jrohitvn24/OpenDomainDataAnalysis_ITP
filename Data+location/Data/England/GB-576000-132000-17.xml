		<title>17BENENDEN WEALD, FOUR WENTS.</title>
		<content> The timber framed house at Four Wents 
 is a prominent local landmark,        
 standing opposite the grass triangle  
 at the cross roads, and is the home of
 one of the sons of Forest Farm and his
 family. It was at one time a pub and  
 shows the typical wealden jetting of  
 the upstairs. The porch proudly       
 proclaims  1681 in a pattern of black 
 and white triangles in the plaster,   
 but this  probably only tells of one  
 of the many phases of modernisation.  
 Parts of the structure are local      
 sandstone blocks, but the main        
 infilling between the closely spaced  
 timbers is wattle and daub. Some has  
 recently been renewed and is a sunny  
 warm ochre. Inside it is the details  
 such as the wooden latches with their 
 leather thongs and the combed pattern 
 in the attic plaster that linger in   
 ones mind.                            </content>
