		<content> MY FAMILY AND I ALL WEAR DIFFERENT    
 TYPES OF CLOTHING.MY SISTER MAINLY    
 WEARS SCHOOL UNIFORM FOR KING EDMUND'S
 SCHOOL WHICH IS GREEN, GREY OR BLACK  
 SKIRT, WHITE BLOUSE AND  GREEN JUMPER.
 FOR WORK MY DAD WEARS A WHITE         
  SHIRT AND GREY JUMPER, TROUSERS AND  
 JACKET AS HE IS A CHAUFFEUR. AT HOME  
 HE WEARS OLD CLOTHES FOR WORKING IN   
 THE GARAGE AND A SUIT FOR GOING OUT ON
 SPECIAL OCCASIONS. MY MUM WEARS SKIRTS
 AND T-SHIRTS AND FOR SPECIAL OCCASIONS
 SHE WEARS SUITS OR DRESSES. THE LATEST
 FASHION IN 1985 IS  BAGGY JEANS,      
 LEATHER TIES, STRING VESTS AND        
 SWEAT BANDS. MY CLOTHES ARE ALRIGHT I 
 SUPPOSE BUT I AM VERY FUSSY ABOUT WHAT
 I WEAR AND IF I ASK MY MUM ITS        
 HOPELESS BECAUSE EVERYTHING SHE       
 CHOOSES I DON'T LIKE. I GET MY CLOTHES
 FROM SOUTHEND.
