		<title>05THE MANOR (RUARDEAN,GLOS)</title>
		<content>  The old Manor is now just a pile of  
 stone. It is old, hard stone. Many of 
 the people think that it was a castle 
 but it's not. I can see it from our   
 garden  wall. it used to be inherited 
 by rich people. It is probably older  
 than the church we have. The church   
 was built in 1111. When it was new it 
 was probably guarded by cannon each   
 way. It's been wrecked for years now  
 and when my Dad was a boy he used to  
 ride up and down on his bike. The     
 county Council want to get together   
 and build it up to its proper state.  
 It's very convenient having it over   
 our wall because I can sit and sketch 
 on the wall. All I draw is a pile of  
 rubble. Cromwell stood on Pettycroft  
 and fired with his cannon so he broke 
 it down.
