		<title>15Housing In Bishop Monkton</title>
		<content> The great majority of houses in the   
 area are those in or near the village 
 of Bishop Monkton,where the total     
 number within the village boundaries  
 is about 300.About two-thirds of these
 are brick or stone-built houses of    
 various sizes mostly built before the 
 1939-45 war,many of which have now    
 been extended or modernised.At the    
 south-west extremity of the village   
 there is a public housing estate of   
 forty houses,most of which were built 
 in 1965,and there are two estates of  
 modern houses and bungalows,totalling 
 about ninety in all,which were all    
 built during the period 1975/6 by     
 large firms of estate developers.No   
 other large scale development has     
 taken place or is expected,and the    
 area is officially designated as a    
 Conservation Area.
