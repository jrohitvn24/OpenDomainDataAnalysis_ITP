		<content> We have to catch a bus to go to school
 in Blagdon, because we live in        
{Butcombe.}Butcombe is a tiny village  
 about two kilometres to the north of  
 Blagdon, just off the edge of the     
 D-Block. We cross over{Blagdon Lake}by
 the road over the dam at its west end,
 then we climb steeply to reach        
 Blagdon. Sometimes we are late for    
 school if we meet the cows in the     
 lanes. In winter the roads are often  
 very slippery with ice or snow. Two   
 years ago we were snowed in on the    
 farm and I missed a week at school!   
 In{1972}the{Mendips}were made an Area 
 of{Outstanding Natural Beauty}by the  
 Countryside Commission. This means    
 that it is so special that we must    
 take care to{protect}it, especially   
 the animals and plants we have        
 here.There can be no camping here and 
 only good home extensions are allowed.</content>
