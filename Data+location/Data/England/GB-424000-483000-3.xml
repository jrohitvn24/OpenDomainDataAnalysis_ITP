		<title>03Snape Castle, North Yorks.</title>
		<content> As you approach Snape from the main   
 road, you come down an imposing avenue
 of lime trees, and at the end of the  
 trees is a castle. The present        
 building dates from the fifteenth     
 century and occupies the site of an   
 older Manor House. Under the castle   
 there are no foundations, only huge   
 oaken piles 12 feet long and 8 feet in
 diameter which are about 700 years    
 old. The Neville family owned Snape   
 and the castle until 1798.Catherine   
 Parr, the last wife of Henry          
 VIII,lived here when she was married  
 to her second husband,the 3rd Lord    
 Latimer of Snape.Most of the castle is
 in ruins,but the South Wing forms two 
 private residences.The chapel in the  
 castle is used for Sunday Services and
 is the only part open to the public.
