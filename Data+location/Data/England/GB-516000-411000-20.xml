		<title>20Changing Schools</title>
		<content> At the end of this year I will be     
 going to Healing school.It is very big
 comprared to this school.I am quite   
 nervous about going up.It will seem   
 strange being the youngest instead of 
 the oldest.We have been to look round 
 the school for a morning.Some of the  
 kids looked massive compared to us.The
 school is quite nice.It has a lot of  
 rooms for different subjects like     
 maths,English,science etc.I have been 
 to a fairly big schhol before but for 
 the people that haven't it wiil be    
 quite a big shock.On our morning      
 looking round we saw all the          
 classrooms.We did a bit of music and  
 had a go on the computers.We also ate 
 lunch.I am quite looking forward to   
 going.
