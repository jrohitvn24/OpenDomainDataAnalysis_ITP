		<title>13Clay Pigeon Shoots</title>
		<content> Shoot.                                
 On Sunday June 16th, the monthly clay 
 pigeon shoot was held at Lowe's Farm. 
 I went to watch Dad shoot.  Dad was   
 picked up by his friend Eric.  I had  
 to go on my bike so dad and his       
 friends could go to the Three         
 Greyhounds afterwards.  When we       
 arrived we signed in.  In our group   
 were Mr Radcliffe, Eric, Neil, Brian  
 and Dad.  It was a 50 bird shoot.  We 
 went in the wood where the first stand
 was a fur and feathers.  There were 5 
 pairs on it.  The next was a 5 pairs  
 and it was a bolting rabbit.  On      
 number 4 the clays went between two   
 trees and was worth 5 points.  The    
 last stand was a sitting duck.  Dad   
 came first.
