		<content>The young birds can get gapes, a       
disease in which worms develop in the  
trachia making breathing difficult.    
This is avoided by completely cleaning 
out their sheds and disinfecting every 
ten weeks.                             
When the pheasants are released some go
to areas where there are no pheasants. 
This is good because in the wild the   
birds do not breed successfully. They  
are disturbed mostly by people or dogs.
Also modern farming has removed the    
insects that would be the food for the 
young. The Keeper is always asking     
walkers to be quiet and explaining why.
During the season they hope to shoot   
50% of the birds. Each time they hold  
a shoot ten guns are used, mostly by   
members of the London-based group.     
The price for last season's birds, if  
sold, was three pounds a brace. The    
cost of producing them was ten pounds. </content>
