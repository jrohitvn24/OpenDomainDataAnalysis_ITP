		<content>Hollinsclough School is a Polling      
Station. A few days before the Election
two polling booths arrived, both were  
wooden 185m high by 65 cms wide. Inside
a little shelf on which you rest your  
paper when you vote, a pencil is       
provided. You mark your vote on a      
ballot paper.                          
On May 2nd the children had a holiday  
but four of us volunteered to come and 
interview people, these included the   
candidates - Eileen Critchlow and      
Malcolm Ward, the Policeman-P.C. Potts 
and the voters.                        
Mrs. Bowers, the Polling Clerk,ticked  
the voters name off the register of    
electors, Mr. Bowers, Polling Officer, 
gave the voters their ballot paper.The 
votes are placed in a wooden black box.
It is sealed with sealing wax and then 
taken to Leek for the votes to be      
counted.Michelle Grindy Age 10         </content>
