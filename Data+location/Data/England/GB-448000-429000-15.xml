 As soon as I woke up in the morning I 
 knew I had to get ready for a         
{difficult morning at Selby music      
{centre.}After I had got dressed I had 
 to have some{breakfast}for my hard    
{cornet playing.}At band we warmed up  
 and got our music to play.Most of the 
 people there were from last term.We   
 always{have fun.}When I got home I    
 went on the computer.My Grandma and   
 Grandad came for the rest of the      
 afternoon. Then after tea they went   
 home.
