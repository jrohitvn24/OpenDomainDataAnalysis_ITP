		<content> The day starts early between 5 and 6  
 when my husband and two sons leave for
 their jobs,farm work,local factory    
 and one agricultural haulage.This is a
 farming area,a lot of local people are
 involved one way or another.I work two
 days a week in a shop, the rest caring
 for my family. I wash in a twin tub   
 machine and I cook with bottled gas.  
 Most houses are farms or cottages,some
 new houses and bungalows.We live in a 
 3 bedroomed cottage with a big garden.
 We grow a lot of vegetables which we  
 freeze in season,also fruit.My eldest 
 son keeps a pig for the freezer.We    
 live in beautiful country and like    
 walking.We watch more television in   
 winter. We have a cat but most of our 
 neighbours keep dogs.Both boys are    
 Venture Scouts and Young Farmers. I   
 attend W.I. and Keep Fit classes.
