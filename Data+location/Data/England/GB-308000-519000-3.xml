		<title>03FELL RUNNING IN LAMPLUGH</title>
		<content> There are two fell races in Lamplugh, 
 The Copeland Chase and The Blake Fell 
 Race. They both start at the Pack of  
 Hounds, Lamplugh. The Blake Fell Race 
 is seven and a half miles with 2300   
 feet of climbing.                     
 Fell running is a race over steep     
 hilly country. For a short race you   
 would go straight up and down a fell. 
 For a long race you would go up a few 
 fells. Fells are what you call hills  
 or mountains. Fell running started in 
 Lakeland, at first they were          
 professional races and you won money. 
 Younger people started coming and     
 trophies and medals were awarded. The 
 amateur races started in the 1960's.  
 More runners came and fell running    
 became very popular. It can get very  
 lonely up on the fells. To enter a    
 long distance fell race in Cumbria in 
 1985 you have to be over eighteen.    </content>
