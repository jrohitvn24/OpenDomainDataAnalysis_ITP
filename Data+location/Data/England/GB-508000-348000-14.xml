		<title>14SHOPS IN OUR VILLAGE</title>
		<content> Many of the shops in my village are   
 not normally found in what most people
 would call a village. this may be     
 because of it's size.(4000 people)    
 there are as you would expect many    
 typical corner shops,but hereare some 
 of the unusual ones:                  
        1)furniture shop               
        2)d.i.y. store                 
        3)fish and chip restaurant(as  
 well as an ordinary separate chip     
 shop)                                 
        4)insurance broker             
        5)specialist shoe shop         
        6)microwave shop               
        7)c.b. radio shop              
       As you can see above we think   
 some of the shops are fairly unique   
 for a village.                        
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
