		<content>{WHAT ABOUT ENTERTAINMENT? }Well in a  
 little place like{Coltishall}we       
 haven't got much to do. In the old    
 days I used to go into the city to the
 theatre, my wife still likes to watch 
 a play.                               
 These days we make do with the pub. I 
 bowl and play darts, but mostly we    
 watch the telly.                      
{WHAT ABOUT YOUNGER PEOPLE? }I         
 sometimes feel sorry for them, but of 
 course the city isn't that far away,  
 and most of them have motorbikes or   
 cars now anyway. The very young ones  
 are the worst off unless their parents
 ferry them about.                     
{DO YOU LIKE THE AREA? }I've lived here
 all my life and I wouldn't go anywhere
 else. The people are friendly and they
 know everybody, even the new people.
