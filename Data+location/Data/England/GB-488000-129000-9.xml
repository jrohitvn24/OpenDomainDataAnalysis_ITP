		<title>09THE CHANGING LANDSCAPE</title>
		<content>    Mrs Rene Cook has lived in the     
 Kingsley Green area for 22 years. She 
 has seen some changes in her time. A  
 General shop along the main road is   
 now a restaurant. There used to be a  
 Bakers and a Post Office. They have   
 now been turned into private houses.  
 There are two interesting sites in    
 Bell Vale - Lowder Mill, the first of 
 a chain of watermills, and Kingsley   
 Green Pottery. There were houses      
 called 'Bell Cottages' on the main    
 road, which was a Dames School. There 
 used to be a Public house called the  
 'Blue Bell'. There also used to be a  
 Brewery at Bell Vale Lane. Bell Vale  
 redeived its name from the Public     
 house 'The Blue Bell'.                
  The stream which runs along Bell     
 Vale Lane rises on Blackdown near     
 Cotchet Farm and is the main source of
 the river Wey.                        </content>
