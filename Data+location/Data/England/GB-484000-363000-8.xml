		<content> The earlist church was connected with 
 the Priory at Eagle.The first building
 was probably a small oblong           
 construction with a Chantry at the    
 north east corner.The early Saxon     
 archway and the south wall are the    
 oldest parts of the church.The        
 earliest Norman architecture points to
 the archway and the narrow north      
 aisle.The tower and the pointed arch  
 in the chancel point to later Norman  
 construction.It was not until the     
 17th.century that any significant     
 changes took place.At this time the   
 seating was changed and singing       
 galleries were added near the tower.  
 One curious custom was that           
 freeholders were held responsible for 
 the repair of sections of the church  
 fence.This,it is reported led to much 
 misunderstanding.The church once had a
 fine library and an Elizabethan cup.  </content>
