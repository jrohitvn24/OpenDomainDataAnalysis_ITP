		<title>11My Home _ by Michelle.</title>
		<content>    I live in a semi-detached bungalow 
 at 1, Rectory Close, with my parents, 
 two brothers and my pets. The bungalow
 has three bedrooms, a big kitchen, a  
 lounge and Daddy has built an         
 extension.                            
    When I get home from school I      
 change into a dress but if its cold I 
 wear a jumper and trousers. On cold   
 days I like coming home to a cosy fire
 to read my books. On hot days I sit in
 the garden and draw. I like coming    
 home to see my two parents, my        
 brothers and saying "Hello" to my     
 pets.                                 
    I like watching television but I   
 also like to play with my friend,     
 another Michelle. Sometimes I cook my 
 own tea.                              
    I like to go for walks over the    
 woods and I look forward to the       
 weekends when I visit my relations.   </content>
