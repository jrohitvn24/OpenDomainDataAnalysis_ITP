		<content>    Dad gets up first and fetches the  
 cows. He brings them into the yard and
 then through the entrance door of the 
 milking parlour.   When they have been
 milked, they go out of another door.  
    The milk goes through some pipes   
 into the storage tank, from which the 
 milk tanker will collect it.   The    
 milk collected in the morning goes to 
 the Milk Marketing Board.             
    We deliver the evening milk the    
 following morning.   When we get back 
 from the milk round, we wash the      
 bottles so that they will be clean for
 the bottling.   Dad does the milking  
 in the evening and Mum bottles it.    
 The milk comes from the cow, through  
 pipes and tanks, down to the bottles. 
 Five bottles are filled at once, and a
 crate holds twenty bottles.   The     
 crates are put in the fridge overnight
 ready for the milkround in the morning</content>
