		<title>07A TEENAGER IN KEMBERTON</title>
		<content> Louise McGrath is a 15 year old girl  
 who lives in Kemberton. On weekdays   
 she has to travel to school on a      
 special bus and the journey takes half
 an hour. She does not often go out in 
 the evenings because there is not much
 to do in Kemberton. There used to be a
 youth club in the village hall but it 
 closed down recently. One night a week
 she plays squash at the Tennis and    
 Racket club in Shifnal and another    
 night she goes to Judo in the school  
 gym. Louise plays the guitar and is a 
 member of a folk group which has      
 performed in a number of concerts. On 
 Saturdays she either plays tennis or  
 goes shopping, often to Bridgnorth. On
 Sundays she usually stays at home.
