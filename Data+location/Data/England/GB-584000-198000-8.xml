		<title>08Cold Norton School May Fair.</title>
		<content>  On the morning of May 11th 1985 at   
 11 o'clock 81 cross country runners   
 set off on a 2 mile run across the    
 golf course.Most of the runners took  
 about 20-25 minutes to complete the   
 course.Just after the runners had set 
 off the Infants started their         
 obstacle course,and were given a      
 lolly or a medal if they successfully 
 completed the course.                 
     At 2 o'clock the May Fair         
 started. This year because of         
 the rain most of the events had       
 to be held inside the new hall.       
 However outside there was a bouncy    
 clown and various other stalls.The    
 Country Dancers started at 2:30pm     
 followed by the fancy dress,after that
 the prizes were presented for the     
 collages,the puppets and the book     
 covers.                               
                                       </content>
