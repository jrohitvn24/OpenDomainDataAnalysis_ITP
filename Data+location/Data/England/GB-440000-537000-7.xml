		<content> I get up at half seven and go down to 
 get my breakfast.When I have finished 
 I get dressed and pack my school      
 books.I have my hair brushed and wait 
 for Paula.At half past eight we set   
 off for school and when the bell has  
 gone we go in. Mr.Bartle calls the    
 register.We have maths first. Mrs     
 Carter takes us for one hour.Then we  
 have a break.When the bell goes at    
 10.45 we go to P.E. After this it is  
 dinner.I go home for dinner but you   
 can stay for school dinner or packed  
 lunch.The register is called again at 
 1.05. We go to sewing next where I am 
 making an apron.Mrs Casson takes us   
 for Humanities after this, and then   
 comes hometime.When I get home I get  
 dressed, do my homework and help my   
 mum.I go out for an hour until my dad 
 comes in.After tea I go to Karate.At 9
 o'clock I go to bed.                  </content>
