		<content> MURCH BROS UMBERLEIGH-ENGINEERS       
 Murch Bros sell and repair farm       
 machinery and lawnmowers. Murch Bros  
 was rebuilt 40 years in 1945 but the  
 business was started in 1880 by       
 William and Thomas Murch. William was 
 a blacksmith and Thomas a carpenter.  
 They have never had a fire. The       
 biggest thing they have ever fixed is 
 a reed comber that weighs 2 tons. 15  
 people work there. They've never had a
 strike and when the River Taw has     
 flooded its reached them lots of      
 times.  They've been robbed once of   
 lawnmowers and several little things. 
 They open at 8am and shut at 5pm      
 weekdays and 8am-12pm on Saturdays.
