 is from the north to south. The stream
 from Sculpins Farm runs through Duck  
 End into the centre of Finchingfied   
 where it is widened into a duck pond. 
 It is known as Finchingfield Brook    
 and runs south to meet the River Pant 
 just north of Bardfield.Another stream
 in the centre of the area is widened  
 into an artifical lake near Petches   
 Farm before meeting the Pant which    
 flows away south-west to Braintree.   
       The road that runs from the     
 Sampfords to Braintree is the B1053.  
 The road that runs from Haverhill to  
 Great Dunmow is called the B1057.These
 roads meet in Finchingfield and form a
 crossroads. The B1053 road goes down  
 in the direction of South east.The    
 B1057 runs in the direction of the    
 South west.
