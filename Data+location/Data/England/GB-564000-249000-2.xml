		<title>02Thurlow village school</title>
		<content> Thurlow voluntary controlled primary  
 school caters for 53 children aged    
 between 5 and 9 years, in 2 classes   
 with 1 part time and 2 full time      
 capable caring teachers and 4         
 ancillary staff. Recent national      
 teachers' union action seems to have  
 had little relevance or impact here.  
 The pleasant airy semi-open plan      
 building is 18 years old and the      
 continuity of this village is such    
 that many parents and grandparents    
 were themselves taught at the original
 Little Thurlow school or the Great    
 Thurlow school which is now the Estate
 office. Children travel from Cowlinge,
 Great and Little Bradley, Wratting and
 Withersfield as well as Thurlow. A few
 walk, some come on the school bus,    
 parents share lifts. The atmosphere is
 happy and relaxed with the colourful  
 results of the childrens' work.       </content>
