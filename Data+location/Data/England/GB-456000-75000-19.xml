 The church was opened in 1875 in Mill 
 Street, now called Pier Street. The   
 cafe next door was the Manse. The     
 church seats approx. 300 and in the   
 summer there is a congregation of     
 about 155 people. The Pastor is the   
 Revd. Raymond Eveleigh and there are  
 35 active members of the church who   
 come mainly from Ventnor, Wroxall,    
 Bonchurch and St. Lawrence. The       
 organist is Mr. Hollis. There are two 
 services on a Sunday and Communion    
 twice a month. The collection is about
 Â£130 a week. The church supports the  
 Baptist Missionary Society, Leprosy   
 Mission and Christian Radio work. The 
 Sunday School meets on Sunday at 11   
 am. and has about 12 children. The    
 church is heated by gas and has a hall
 and a number of other rooms attached  
 to it.                                </content>
