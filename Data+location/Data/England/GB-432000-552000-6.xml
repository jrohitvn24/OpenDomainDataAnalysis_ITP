		<title>06Shiney Row - My Village</title>
		<content>   My community is called Shiney Row,  
 it is a small{village}and the people  
 are friendly.It has lots of shops and 
 everything we want is here. If not we 
 either get the bus or travel in our   
 cars to the Galleries in Washington   
   In Shiney Row we have Starks DIY and
 a YMCA club where they hold{Galas}and 
 famous people come like Ken Dodd and  
 Rod Hull and Emu. A main road runs    
 through our village and in the middle 
 is a big roundabout, so lots of people
 pass through here in their{cars.      
   Shiney Row is supposed to have been 
 given its name from the visit of a    
 member of the Royal Family in the 19th
 centuary who as they passed through   
 was overheard to say "What a shiney   
 row of houses".At that time Shiney Row
 was just a few houses around a pit.   
 Today there are hundreds of houses but
 the only pit left is in Herrington.   </content>
