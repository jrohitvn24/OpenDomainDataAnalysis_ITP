		<content> An important feature of the area is   
 the railway line which passes through.
 It links Middlesbrough to Whitby, and 
 serves rural and some urban areas     
 between. Two rail halts are in the    
 Nunthorpe and Marton area. Gypsy Lane 
 Halt to the north has been built      
 within the last 10 years to accomodate
 the increasing commuter demand into   
 Middlesbrough. Some controversy       
 existed two years ago when the        
 manually operated gates, which had    
 protected road traffic on the rail    
 crossing, were removed. The replacing 
 traffic lights and ungated crossing   
 was thought to be dangerous. Nunthorpe
 itself has a station with a manned    
 signal box. From here the signalman   
 controls this section of track. He    
 also operates the crossing barriers.  
 Trains run about once an hour in each 
 direction and are well used.          </content>
