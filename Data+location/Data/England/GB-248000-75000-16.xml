		<title>16Recreation:Peter Tavy Area</title>
		<content> There are no facilities in the Peter  
 Tavy area for sports so people have to
 travel to Launceston or Plymouth to   
 find swimming pools and to Tavistock  
 for other sporting facilities.There   
 are three theatres and several cinemas
 in Plymouth which people in this area 
 use for entertainment.The most popular
 family sport in Peter Tavy and around 
 that area is swimming and many        
 individuals enjoy this sport as well. 
 Besides swimming many individuals like
 horse-riding.One unusual family hobby 
 is writing and quite a few people like
 playing musical instruments;gardening 
 and reading were also popular hobbies.
 Most people were satisfied living in  
 the area but one person interviewed   
 was dissatisfied as he thought there  
 was not enough to do.                 
                                       
                                       </content>
