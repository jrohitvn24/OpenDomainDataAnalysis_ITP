		<title>19Improving King's Sutton</title>
		<content>    We talked to the retired           
 head-master of the village Primary    
 School.   We asked him what changes he
 would like to see in King's Sutton.   
 He said that there are lovely walks   
 along the River Cherwell and the canal
 but the villagers cannot get there    
 because the access is privately owned.
 He wants the farmers to stop planting 
 the footpaths and for all the paths   
 and bridle-tracks to be opened.       
    He would like a Health Clinic, a   
 library (not a mobile one) and a      
 bowling green.                        
    When he was head-master he noticed 
 that many of the mothers brought their
 children to school by car; this caused
 traffic jams and made the roads       
 dangerous.   He would like all the    
 mothers nearby to walk their children 
 to school.                            
                                       </content>
