		<content> The non-arable areas are the banks of 
 Bottisham and Swaffham lodes, the bank
 and wash of the River Cam, ditches,   
 droveways, verges and a few hedges. In
 addition there is a stretch of        
 pasture along the west bank of        
 Swaffham lode, and a stand of trees   
 with mixed scrub known as Swaffham    
 Poor's Fen. This latter area is       
 heavily shot over by people from      
 Swaffham Bulbeck.                     
 Of the two lodes, Swaffham is the     
 deeper and wider, supports more plant 
 life, and, unlike Bottisham lode, is  
 habitually closed off from the River  
 by lock gates, so the water level,    
 whilst no more that two or three feet 
 in depth, is consistent. Bottisham    
 Lode has a gate, but this is usually  
 open and the water level fluctuates   
 between a few feet and a few inches.
