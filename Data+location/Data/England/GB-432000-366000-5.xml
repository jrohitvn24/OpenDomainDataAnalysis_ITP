   The chickens are kept in 6 large    
 sheds each with a floor area of       
 approximately 10,000 square feet. Each
 shed houses 40,000 birds which arrive 
 from the hatchery in Lincolnshire at  
 one day old.Each batch is either male 
 or female, never mixed.               
 Initially the chicks are confined to  
 the area near food,water and warmth   
 provieded by gas heaters.After two    
 days, when they know the location of  
 these things, they are given the run  
 of the entire shed. The shed is kept  
 at 83 degrees Fahrenheit until the    
 18th day when it is reduced to 63     
 degrees Fahrenheit.                   
 After 49 days when male birds weigh   
 approximately 4 3/4 pounds and female 
 birds 4 1/4 pounds they are sent to   
 Great Longstone to be killed and      
 processed.                            </content>
