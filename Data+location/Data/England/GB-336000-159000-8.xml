		<content>   The earliest record of a school is  
 1765 when the Bishop of Bath and Wells
 headed a subscription list with ten   
 guineas for the upkeep of two rooms in
 West Street.                          
   The school must not have functioned 
 very well as Hannah More opened a     
 parochial school in 1791. After a     
 promising start the school was closed 
 down in 1799.                         
    A National School existed between  
 1800 and 1820. In 1824 a New National 
 School was built on the land given by 
 the Bishop.                           
    In 1862 the old building was       
 exchanged for Temperance Hall in High 
 Street. This building was officially  
 abandoned in 1926 when the present    
 school was opened, although it was    
 used again between 1950 and 1960 for  
 additional classes and school meals.
