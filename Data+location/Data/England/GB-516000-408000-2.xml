		<title>02MY HOUSE IN KEELBY</title>
		<content> I am an eleven year old girl living in
 Keelby.I am a pupil at Keelby County  
 Primary School.My name is Natalie     
 Hollowday.I enjoy tennis,netball and  
 rambling in woods and fields in the   
 area.I like animals and enjoy looking 
 after dogs.There is a dancing school  
 which is very exciting, but hard      
 work.Also I go to Guides and I am in a
 choir at Keelby Parish Church.        
   I live in a semi-detached council   
 house which is about 30 years old.My  
 mum and dad live with me,but I have no
 brothers or sisters.I have many       
 animals like dogs,guinea-pigs and     
 goldfish.We have quite a big garden in
 which my dad grows vegetables like    
 carrots,onions and potatoes.I grow    
 flowers with my dad and mum, as we all
 enjoy gardening.My dad is on the dole 
 so he spends much time in the garden.
