		<title>06CHILWELL. Local History.</title>
		<content>  In{July 1918}there was a large       
 explosion at the Chilwell shell       
 filling factory on the west side of   
 the village. Many were killed.        
  "A huge pall of smoke appeared before
 anyone realised what had happened. I  
 remember sitting up most of the night 
 watching the lorries passing laden    
 with injured and many workers         
 struggling home, suffering badly from 
 shock. The next day I accompanied my  
 grandmother in a landau, perched on   
 the box beside the driver searching   
 the hospitals for an uncle, who we    
 found had died on admission to the    
 General Hospital."
