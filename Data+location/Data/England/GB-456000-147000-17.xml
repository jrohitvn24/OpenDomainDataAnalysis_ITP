		<title>17Children in Oakley 1</title>
		<content> Many of the children living in Oakley 
 follow a wide range of pursuits out   
 of school time. Activities include    
{Brownies, Guides, Cubs and Scouts.}   
 They attend classes for ballet, tap   
 and acrobatic{dancing.}They learn to  
 play brass, woodwind and stringed     
{instruments}as well as the piano.     
 Popular{sporting activities}are:      
 football organised by Oakley Boys     
 Football Club, swimming at Westfield  
 Lido, tennis at Andover Road tennis   
 courts, cricket at the club between   
 Oakley Park and the railway line,     
 badminton at Andover Road Village Hall
 and Basingstoke and majorette groups  
 in Basingstoke.  Some children also   
 enjoy horse riding, cycling and judo. 
 Much of this is only possible because 
 parents are willing to take their     
 children by car to the venues and can 
 afford pay for the activities.        </content>
