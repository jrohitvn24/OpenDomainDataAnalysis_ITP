		<title>04TRADE_SHOPPING IN TIPTREE</title>
		<content> Tiptree caters well for the needs of  
 the local people.There are several    
 supermarkets along the main street    
 which is called Church Road.The Post  
 Office has moved up and down Church   
 Road several times over the last 15   
 years but has been at its present site
 since 1981.Because of the population  
 explosion of recent times there has   
 been a campaign for a Crown Post      
 Office which has been unsuccessful.   
 The only shopping facility that       
 Tiptree really lacks in 1985 is a     
 furniture store.These items can be    
 bought in Witham,7 miles away,        
 Colchester, 12 miles,Maldon 10 miles  
 and Chelmsford, (The county town of   
 Essex),17 miles distant.
