		<content> Oxstalls Stud is situated between the 
 Warwick Road and the River Avon.      
 Farming here concentrates upon the    
 breeding,rearing,and training of race 
 horses.The Stud was started in 1975   
 and there are now about 40 acres of   
 pasture.In July 1985 there were about 
 100 mares,50 foals,and 4 stallions on 
 the farm.The number is constantly     
 changing as mares are brought to the  
 Stud and foals purchased.A foal can   
 cost between Â£500 and Â£10000.Most     
 buyers come from within a 250 mile    
 radius but some come from further     
 afield.A normal day for the owner and 
 his helper would start at 7am and     
 finish at about 7pm.It takes 2 hours  
 just to mix the feeds,then the rest of
 the day is spent in grooming,mucking  
 out,and schooling.The horses are fed  
 on oats,bran,and chaff.Veterinary     
 fees are one of the major expenses.   </content>
