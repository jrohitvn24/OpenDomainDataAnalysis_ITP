		<content> Three farms in the area are dairy     
 farms as well as keeping beef cattle  
 and sheep.The average size of dairy   
 herd is 95 milking cows.They are      
 milked twice a day, at 6.30 in the    
 morning and again at 5.45 in the      
 evening.The dairy farms are the ones  
 with better pasture, generally the    
 lower land in the valleys and they    
 tend to have been improved by draining
 and re-seeding.As with beef cattle,   
 the cows are kept in shelter in Winter
 and fed on silage gathered in late    
 June and July .Each of the farms has a
 milking parlour, again quite recently 
 installed.The milk produced is        
 collected each day by a tanker lorry  
 from the refrigerated tanks on the    
 farms and taken to the dairy in       
 Carlisle.The main cow breeds are      
 Friesian and Ayrshire.
