		<title>12THE FORT: TILBURY</title>
		<content>{The Fort}was built in 1539 to stop    
 invaders getting to London. The fort  
 was based on a strategic pentagon     
 shape. The fort has a chapel and a    
 haord of cannons and cannonballs.     
 There was a hospital but it was       
 knocked down in the 1960s. The fort   
 has an open courtyard and three water 
 pumps (not in use). You have to cross 
 two drawbridges to get to the         
 landgate. Across the courtyard there  
 is a watergate. Under the fort there  
 are a series of underground passages  
 to feed shells to the cannons in war. 
 There are also two magazines and a    
 gatehouse. People can go and visit the
 fort and walk around.
