		<content>   The sport of BMX originated way back
 in 1969 when a group of children, who 
 liked the sport of motocross but      
 couldn't afford to take part, started 
 racing their pedal bikes on dirt.The  
 first ever organised race was held in 
 Palms Park,Santa Monica,USA.In 1973   
 the first BMX Championship was held by
 Scott Breithaupt at Long Beach        
 California.The sport continued to grow
 rapidly.In 1973 the first real BMX    
 bike was manufactured.More tracks     
 appeared and a body was set up to     
 organise race meetings throughout the 
 USA, eventually coming to Britain in  
 the spring of1980.One of the first    
 meetings in the U.K.was held at       
 Cleethorpes.The track consisted of    
 wooden jumps in a field. More tracks  
 were built and more products appeared 
 on the market.
