		<title>13SHOPPING IN WINGERWORTH</title>
		<content>   Wingerworth has one parade of shops 
 at Edinburgh Court consisting of these
 types of shops:                       
                                       
  {Supermarket    Post Office/Newsagent
  {Bakers         Butchers             
{  Greengrocers   Hairdressers}        
                                       
 When we went to the shops we          
 questionned the customers and the shop
 keepers.                              
  We found that people only used these 
 'local' shops if they found it        
 difficult to get into Chesterfield    
 to the larger and cheaper shops, eg.  
 if they had a small baby, or if they  
 didn't have  a car.                   
   Some people did all their main food 
 and household shopping in bulk once a 
 month, so they just came to Edinburgh 
 Court twice a week for perishable     
 goods.                                </content>
