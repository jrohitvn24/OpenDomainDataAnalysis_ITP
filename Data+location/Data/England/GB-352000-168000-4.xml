		<title>04KATIE'S MONDAY MORNING</title>
		<content> I usually wake at 6.30 a.m. in order  
 to dress at 7.oo. By the time I am    
 dressed it is about 7.15. No-one is   
 awake when I rise, so I have to be    
 quiet. Mondays are always busy because
 of swimming in the morning and        
 gymnastics in the evening. A quick    
 breakfast is followed by 'Popeye' on  
 TVAM, but then I switch channels. My  
 breakfast consists of a yoghurt and a 
 piece of fruit. My mother awakes and  
 comes down at about 8.00 a.m., and we 
 leave before 8.40 to go to school. At 
 school, the register and swimming     
 numbers are called, then we do either 
 Maths or English before Swimming. At  
 the Baths we sometimes have to swim   
 fourteen lengths, but usually it is   
 only six. Sometimes we do diving      
 practice or grades. Then it is back to
 school for a nice salad.
