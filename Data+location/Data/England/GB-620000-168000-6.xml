		<title>06Home Life-A Child's Day.</title>
		<content>Every Saturday morning I wake up early 
and I go downstairs to see Mum,who is  
downstairs before me every morning. I  
go to the lounge and let Melba, our    
cat,out if Mum hasn't let her out      
already.Then I read a book in bed and  
Mum brings me up a cup of tea.Next I   
get up and go downstairs to watch T.V. 
Then at nine o'clock or earlier I get  
dressed, have breakfast, then I play   
with Melba until my cousin Louise      
comes to spend the day with us.We ask  
Mum if we can go up to the fields at   
the end of my road and we have to come 
back at a certain time.We always go    
there on a Saturday.It was a lovely    
field with flowers and trees but it is 
wasteland, some vegetation has grown   
up over the barren land. There is pile 
of mud that has hardened.We call it    
the ant hill and we play around it.We  
always go to a hide out in the bushes. </content>
