		<content> The second time we visited Arkley we  
 wanted to know if the piggery was     
 still there. Mr. Brettingham saw a    
 lady doing her garden and she came to 
 the fence and told us that the piggery
 had gone. She then went in and brought
 out some biscuits and we shared them  
 out equally. While we were eating the 
 biscuits the lady said we were        
 "splendid chaps". Her name was Miss   
 Rowley and she lives at Rose Cottage. 
 We asked her if her name had anything 
 to do with Rowley Lane in Arkley. She 
 said, no but her father used to say it
 was very useful when he wanted credit!
 We wrote to Miss Rowley and said thank
 you.                                  
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
