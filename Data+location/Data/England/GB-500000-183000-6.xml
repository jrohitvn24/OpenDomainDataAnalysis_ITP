 As the days of talkie movies dawned,a 
 MR Charles Boot joined with two other 
 men and bought a large Victorian      
 estate,and large gardens,which they   
 turned into film studios called       
 PINEWOOD.Boot later employed J.Arthur 
 Rank,who began the Rank Organisation. 
 PINEWOOD has a sixteenth century door 
 and at least 100 tree lined acres for 
 filming,sixteen stages and twenty-five
 departments for film making,from      
 lighting to dubbing,and producing.    
 PINEWOOD also has a bar for the       
 workers and a sophisticated one for   
 the stars.Bond films have been        
 privileged to have a studio built     
 especially for them to be filmed in.  
 Carry-on films were made at PINEWOOD  
 and Superman films.
