		<title>01GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF AREA</title>
		<content>   The area is very rural being seven  
 miles from the nearest small town,    
 Bourne and twenty miles from the      
 nearest city, Peterborough.           
   The west of the area is part of the 
 Kesteven Plateau, the land is gently  
 sloping and is drained by two streams 
 which flow down to the South Forty    
 Foot drain, the main drain of this    
 part of the fens. The Eastern part is 
 fen margin. Most of the area was      
 originally wooded but now all but the 
 heaviest of land is cleared and used  
 for arable farming.                   
   The two main villages in the area   
 are Aslackby (pronounced Aselby) and  
 Pointon.                              
   Farming is very mechanised and large
 quantities of artificial fertilisers  
 and chemical sprays for pest and      
 fungicides are used. Population in the
 area is slowly declining all the time.</content>
