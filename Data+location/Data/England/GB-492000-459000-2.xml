		<title>02Wetwang,Farming.</title>
		<content>      Most of the farming in this area 
 is arable farming with a few beef     
 cattle.When you look in the fields in 
 the summer you can see lots of colours
 where the crops make a patchwork      
 pattern of the view.                  
      The whole of Wetwang is          
 surrounded by fields.The crops grown  
 are wheat,barley,oil seed rape,sugar  
 beet,potatoes,peas,turnips and swedes.
     The main part of the farmer's year
 is harvest.Sometimes they work  from  
 8am.to 11pm.They have to eat          
 sandwiches most of the time.          
      Once the harvest is over the     
 fields are baled or burned and then   
 ploughed.Depending on the weather the 
 field might be rolled,dragged,harrowed
 or riffled.Then the field is          
 drilled,that puts the seed in,and     
 after it has slug pellets planted and 
 then is sprayed against diseases.     </content>
