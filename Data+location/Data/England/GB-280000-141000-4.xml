		<title>04Reclamation of Exmoor</title>
		<content>   Exmoor before 1820 was barren.It    
 was bought by John Knight and taken   
 over by his son Frederick in 1825.    
   In the early 19th century Sir       
 Frederick Knight tried to cultivate   
 Exmoor for farming purposes.He had    
 mixed success but some of his projects
 such as Larkbarrow were abandoned.Sir 
 Frederick went bankrupt and the land  
 had to be split in 2 and eventually   
 to the fortesques.                    
   Two examples of his projects,one    
 success,one failiure:                 
   Red Deer Farm (once an Inn called   
 Gallon House)was a successful farm on 
 the main road from Simonsbath to      
 Exford.                               
   Larkbarrow farm was probably started
 in the 1850's and abandoned in the    
 1870's,it was owned by Farmer Hays and
 then Farmer Meadows.
