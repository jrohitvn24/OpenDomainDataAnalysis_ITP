		<content> The garden centre is about 4yrs old.Mr
 Addington has owned it for 6 months.  
 Before that it was called Garsdon Mill
 Nursery and was owned by the Honorable
 Patrick Howard.Before that it was farm
 land.{The Centre is about 10 acres}but
 a lot of it is undeveloped.They sell  
 trees, tools,house plants,garden      
 chemicals, peat,sheds,garden plants   
 and shrubs. Of these the best selling 
 items are vegetable plants and shrubs.
 Their customers are local and they    
 sell directly to them from the Garden 
 Centre.{Mr Addington}advertises on the
 radio,in local newspapers and by      
 delivering leaflets.He employs 5      
 people.Mr Addington hopes to develop  
 the rest of the 10 acres,to improve   
 existing facilities and to have a pick
 your own farm.His only problems have  
 been getting planning permission for  
 signs,buildings and new roads.        </content>
