		<title>07NEWTOWN PRIMARY SCHOOL</title>
		<content> Newtown School was built in 1851 at a 
 cost of Â£120, the school house was    
 added in 1853 (Â£170), and a second    
 classroom was added in 1871. Two      
 temporary classrooms have recently    
 been added, only one class is still   
 taught in the old building.The house, 
 not used by the present Headteacher,  
 is used for a variety of activities.  
 As a village school its pupils ages   
 ranged from 4 to 13 years. It was used
 for meetings,concerts and as a Polling
 Station. After the 1944 Education Act 
 it became a Primary School and since  
 1958 has pupils up to age 8 only. 100 
 years ago parents were in farming     
 occupations or providing services, now
 the vast majority of parents are      
 professional or naval personnel.      
 Five families are connected with      
 farming including a vine grower.
