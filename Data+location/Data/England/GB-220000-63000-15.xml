		<title>15LIFE STYLES OF THE 1980's</title>
		<content> LIFE STYLES ARE CHANGING. ATTITUDES TO
 MARRIAGE, PARENTHOOD, FAMILY MEALS ARE
 VERY DIFFERENT BETWEEN THOSE IN THEIR 
 30'S AND 60'S.                        
  THE OLD CORNISH PATTERN OF MEALTIMES 
 WAS COOKED BREAKFAST,CRIB(ELEVENSES), 
 A COOKED MIDDAY MEAL, TEA AND SUPPER, 
 ALL, EXCEPT CRIB, EATEN COMMUNALLY.   
 NOW EVEN THE CORNISH EAT LESS OFTEN,  
 AND ARE MORE FLEXIBLE IN THEIR MEAL   
 TIMES. THOSE FROM UP COUNTRY (THE     
 ENGLISH) TEND TO LESS COMMUNAL EATING 
 ALTHOUGH MANY STILL HAVE AN EVENING   
 MEAL TOGETHER.                        
 DIET HAS ALSO CHANGED. THE LOCAL      
 BUTCHER REPORTS A SHIFT EITHER TO     
 FASTER FOOD OR TO A LESS MEAT ORIENTED
 DIET. THE OLDER INHABITANTS CLAIM TO  
 MORE CONSERVATIVE IN FOOD THAN THE    
 YOUNGER. BAKING IS STILL A SKILL      
 VALUED HIGHLY.                        
                                       </content>
