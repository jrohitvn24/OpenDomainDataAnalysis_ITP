		<content>Basil Prior was Mayor in 1984.  He is  
now retired and Manager of Prior's     
Taxis.  He is Didcot born and bred.  He
thinks that Didcot is a fantastic place
with a great future.  He relates that  
his father used to boast that he could 
name every man, woman and child in     
Didcot.  He is pleased that the town is
expanding.                             
                                       
Barbara Horne became Mayoress after    
Basil Prior.  Her main preoccupation is
with shops and light industry.  She is 
concerned that not all the shop        
premises are occupied.  Some light     
industry has already been attracted to 
the area and Mrs Horne hopes that a lot
more will follow.  In her time in      
Didcot there have been many changes.   
It has grown in population and is      
continuing to grow.
