		<content> Every day my Mum goes off to work she 
 usually goes early in the morning. I  
 hardly ever see my Dad because he goes
 abroad to lots of different countries.
 We live in a big house and my Nan and 
 Grampa live in a bungalow joined to   
 our house. Just recently I have been  
 sleeping in the bungalow because my   
 Dad's in the USA and my Mum has been  
 working late nights at the restaurant 
 in Swindon.                           
                                       
                                       
   At home I play with our cats or     
 watch television. Sometimes I go      
 skating. I am going to boarding school
 in September.
