		<content> I like to go to the park where the    
 river flows.I like to go for walks    
 round the school. My dad takes me for 
 walks around the county side.I like   
 going on bike rides round the         
 park.Every time I go to the park      
 my friends are there.There is a       
 difference between the two parks.The  
 river park has just a swing and a     
 slide.But the other park is bigger and
 it has more things to play on.Some    
 times I like to go up to Hairy        
 Mountains because there are trees and 
 bushes.Once I found a piece of metal  
 there. It was sharp at the corners.I  
 tripped on it and fell down. I hurt my
 self.Sometimes, I go to the shop for  
 my nan.Sometimes, I like going out    
 shopping for my mum;there is          
 a butcher and a VG grocers shop.
