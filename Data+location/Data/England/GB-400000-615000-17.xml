		<content> The only shop in the area is at Ingram
 village and that is solely for the    
 tourists who are visiting the         
 information centre.No foods are       
 kept.The valley is well served by     
 travelling shops from various larger  
 centres of population such as Alnwick 
 and Rothbury.The coal merchants come  
 to the area from Shilbottle and       
 Amble.Milk and papers are delivered   
 six times a week (Sunday being the    
 exception).The post is usually        
 delivered during the afternoon with a 
 single collection -also during the    
 afternoon.Many of the locals travel to
 the shops in Alnwick and the post     
 office in Powburn.Pensions are        
 collected by the postman for elderly  
 residents of the valley.
