		<content>{At my school we usually have ten      
 people playing blocky.Someone is it   
 and has to count to one hundred then  
 the rest have to hide.Then the        
 counter has to look for them.If the   
 counter is away from the blocky       
 post one of the hiders can run out of 
 his hiding place and touch the post   
 and shout out blocky 1,2,3,and their  
 name.                                 
   We also play hopscotch in the school
 yard.A line of boxes numbered one to  
 ten is painted on the ground. To play 
 we have to throw a stone on each      
 number in turn.We have to jump into   
 the boxes, one foot in each box, and  
 pick the stone up on the way.If you   
 step on a line you are out.Any number 
 can play this game.
