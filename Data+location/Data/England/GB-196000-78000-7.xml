		<title>07The Fishermen</title>
		<content>    My dad is a fisherman,and has been 
 one for about 15 years.When he has to 
 go fishing his friend Jim May,who is  
 the skipper,gives him a ring the night
 before to tell him what time he has to
 leave in the morning.Whatever time    
 he has to go its usually quite        
 early.Sometimes he has to help make   
 the nets and then go fishing.Jim's and
 dad's boat is called{The Orcades }and 
 they catch lobsters,crabs and fish    
 for a seafood shop run by Jim's wife  
 and my mum.{The Orcades}can go 25     
 knots altogether.There are not any    
 main fish actually in the harbour so  
 they have to go further,to places such
 as Bude and Hartland Bay.Dad and Jim  
 leave{hand made}lobster pots in the   
 rock_pools by the break_water to catch
 them.They sell most of the lobsters   
 and crabs in the shop,they have a tank
 with lobsters in.                     </content>
