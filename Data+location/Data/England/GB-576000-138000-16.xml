  With reference to the square in the  
middle row second from the right:      
                                       
  This area is mainly covered by       
intensive farmers.Farming is the most  
common way of life around it. This     
farming includes hop farming and       
 arden vegetables. Woods also live in  
this area.   Trade and Tourism do not  
appear to have affected this area      
which seems a little cut off from the  
noise nearby.      The area is quite   
old with houses well looked after.Life 
styles are also slow and dreamy. Most  
people look as if they money in their  
pockets so I wouldn't class the area   
as being poor at all. The area is      
surrounded with many small villages    
with the first major town being        
Maidstone some 11 miles away.
