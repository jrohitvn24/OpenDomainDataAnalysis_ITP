		<title>09STEWARTBY: CHILDRENS VIEWS</title>
		<content> "They should open the swimming pool   
 earlier" "Tennis courts and equipment 
 should be bookable in advance" "There 
 should be a Youth Club".              
 I then went on to ask whether they    
 liked Stewartby on the whole. The     
 answers were:                         
 "It is pleasant most of the time but  
 there have been some burglaries and   
 trouble with some teenagers."         
 "It is generally quite friendly       
 because it is so small and you know   
 all the people there."                
 My last question was to ask whether   
 they liked the new management at the  
 brick works.  One child said :        
 "They sacked my dad, and so I couldn't
 care less about them."                
{Conclusion                            
 Obviously, many people dislike living 
 in Stewartby but are tied there by    
 their jobs.                           </content>
