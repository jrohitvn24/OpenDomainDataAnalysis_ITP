		<content>  One house is a tennant farm, which   
 concentrates mainly upon a dairy herd.
 Another was until recently also a     
 tennant farm, but the house has been  
 modernised and most of the land kept  
 by Staffordshire County Council.      
  The two remaining houses were        
 originally mill cottages, but both are
 now modernised and enlarged as private
 dwellings. In one the two inhabitants 
 pursue their home industries, the one 
 being Ochre Mill Home Crafts and the  
 other Ochre Mill Technical Services   
 Ltd. These are cottage industries in  
 the real sense of the word, and are   
 run entirely by the two inhabitants of
 Ochre Mill.                           
  Mosty Lea Mill _ re_built with help  
 of young people from courses at Stoke 
 Technical College. Open to public in  
 future.
