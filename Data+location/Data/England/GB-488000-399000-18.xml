		<title>18The People of Scotton</title>
		<content> Scotton is a friendly,lively village, 
 where everyone knows almost everyone  
 else,at least by sight.Despite the    
 influx of{newcomers}in the 1960's and 
 70's there is no feeling of division  
 between the older Scotton families and
 the newcomers.This is partly because  
 the policy allowing{"infilling"}only  
 has meant that just a few people at a 
 time came into the village.Once here, 
 people tend to stay,often adapting    
 their house or moving to a different  
 one in Scotton as their family needs  
 change.There is a wide range of       
 occupations as well as of ages;class  
 is irrelevant.Village events for{     
{church,village hall,playgroup or      
{Friendship Club}are well supported,   
 though inevitably some give more in   
 time and effort than others.
