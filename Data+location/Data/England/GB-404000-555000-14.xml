		<title>14RIVER TYNE EXCURSION</title>
		<content>{BY ROBERT TAYLOR AGED 9 YEARS         
 ON FRIDAY 12 JULY WE WENT ON THE RIVER
 TYNE.  WE GOT ON THE BOAT AND SAT DOWN
 AND WE WENT TOWARDS THE BRIDGES AT    
 NEWCASTLE.  WE SAW A LOT OF CRANES AT 
 THE DOCKS WHERE ALL THE SHIPS ARE     
 BUILT AND MENDED.  WE ALSO SAW SOME   
 DRY DOCKS AND A LOT OF SMALL BOATS    
 ANCHORED TO THEIR SIDES AND SOME LARGE
 SHIPS.  THERE WAS A BIG WHITE FERRY   
 SHIP WHICH WAS TAKING PEOPLE, CARS AND
 TRUCKS OVER TO DENMARK AND THEN TO    
 SWEDEN, AND WE SAW A RUSSIAN SHIP.  WE
 HAD OUR DINNER ON THE BOAT.  WHEN WE  
 HAD FINISHED OUR DINNER WE SAW THE    
 BRIDGES AT NEWCASTLE  BUT WE COULDN'T 
 GO THROUGH, SO WE TURNED AROUND AND   
 WENT BACK.  ON THE WAY BACK WE SAW A  
 SHIP BEING LOADED WITH COAL AND WE SAW
 THREE TUGS.  THE LAST BIG SHIP THAT   
 WE SAW WAS A NAVY SHIP.  THEN WE WENT 
 TO THE MOUTH OF THE RIVER.            </content>
