I remember the children from Mr Stemp's class coming to see me while i was on the kidney machine,some were fine with it some were not! My friend Jenny started the fund rolling and the people of Chilton held a jumble sale to raise funds for my machine and it was the most they had raised ever,the local garage charged for the use of their private loo to raise money,dances in the village hall and friends even canoed the Thames to Windsor. Happy Days! I'm still living in Chilton and i'm in my 26th year of my original transplant, there have been ups and downs but with help of family ,friends and wonderfull doctors and nurses i'm aiming for the big 30th!   &lt;br />
