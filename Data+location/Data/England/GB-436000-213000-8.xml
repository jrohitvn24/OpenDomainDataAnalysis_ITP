		<title>08A Family Sunday</title>
		<content>I am writing about what my family does 
on Sunday.In the morning my mum puts   
the meat into the oven,and then she    
goes back to bed.We get up and have our
cornflakes and toast.Then we get washed
and dressed.After that we go out and   
play,we sometimes play tig or we play  
40,40.Sometimes we play on the computer
for an hour or two.At 2.00 we have     
dinner.We have pork,roast potatoes,    
peas,yorkshire pudding and gravy.At    
about 3.30 we have pudding.After that  
we either watch television or go for a 
walk.My favourite t.v. programme on a  
Sunday is Murder She Wrote.Because it  
is a Sunday my brothers go to bed at   
7.30 and my sister and I go at 8.45.
