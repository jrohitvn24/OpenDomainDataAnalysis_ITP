		<content>  At Brownies you do all sorts of      
 things. First you pay 20 pence for    
 subscription. This helps to hire the  
 village hall. If you are early you    
 play till 5.30. First we get into     
 groups called sixes and check we have 
 all our uniform and equipment like    
 mini first-aid kit. Then we get into a
 circle to sing the welecome song.     
 Brown Owl is what we call our leader. 
  Sometimes we cook or make cards. One 
 of the helpers teaches us how to use a
 telephone box. When you do things like
 first aid you get a badge if you pass 
 the test. The badge is sewed on the   
 right sleeve of your tunic. Our       
 uniforms are brown.We have a yellow   
 tie a brown belt and a brown hat. We  
 have pack holidays. Last year we went 
 to Penzance and stayed in a school.I  
 was sick on the last day.Brownies     
 finishes at 6.45.                     </content>
