		<title>13LOCAL HISTORY: STATION</title>
		<content>{Potton Railway Station}is{128}years   
 old. At first the train went from     
{Potton to Sandy}and the first engine  
 was called the{Shannon}which can be   
 seen in a museum in Didcot. In 1862   
 the line became part of the{Bedford to
{Cambridge}railway. The line closed in 
 1967.                                 
 The old station has been made into a  
 house, but the old{ticket office}is   
 still there and the{waiting room}is   
 now used as a store room. On the wall 
 behind the platform hangs a sign      
 advertising mustard. The canopy over  
 the platform is in good condition and 
 the iron work is worth seeing. In the 
 pattern the letters{BC}can be seen. BC
 stands for{Bedford/Cambridge.}Where   
 the footbridge used to cross the line 
 potatoes are now growing. Both        
 platforms, however, are still there as
 well as the sign saying{Potton.       </content>
