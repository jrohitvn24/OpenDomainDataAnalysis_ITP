		<content>Greenholm postal sorting office was    
opened in October 1962 and provides    
extra facilities for the distribution  
of mail in the area.Up to this time    
the local church halls were used       
during the Christmas period where      
students were employed temporarily to  
deliver mail. With the rise in postal  
charges the hiring of large numbers of 
students has stopped.                  
 The traffic control room,West Midlands
Police based at Thornbridge Ave.has 21 
closed-circuit cameras focused on the  
motorway system,stretching from Bentley
junction to Coleshill and from Frankley
services to Gravelly Hill interchange. 
2x4 screens are continually monitored. 
The 3 computers are concerned with     
signals;the Police National Computer,  
which deals with stolen cars etc. and  
the West Midlands Police Computer are  
controlled from here.                  </content>
