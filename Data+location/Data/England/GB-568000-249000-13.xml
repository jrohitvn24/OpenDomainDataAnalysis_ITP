		<content>   H.M.Prison,Highpoint,a category'C'  
 prison,was built between 1972 and 1977
 on the site of the former R.A.F.      
 station at Stradishall.It was extended
 in 1983.The site consists of          
 155acres,one-third of which is built  
 on.                                   
   Cells are occupied by 1,2, or 4     
 prisoners.There are several different 
 buildings within the prison complex,  
 including a gym,chapel,education      
 dept.hospital,library,T.V. room and   
 dining-room.Prisoners can learn       
 tailoring,building and plumbing in    
 special workshops.                    
   As this is a category 'C' prison,the
 offences committed by the prisoners   
 are usually burglary or drug abuse.The
 average sentence is two years.        
   The building is to be extended next 
 year,to hold 810 men instead of 600 at
 present.                              </content>
