		<content>   The farms in this area with the     
 exception of a nearby mushroom grower,
{employ}relatively{little labour,}and  
 most local residents commute to nearby
 towns, or to London, for work.        
  {Rural trade,}the sale of eggs, goats
 milk, or farm produce is carried on at
 many farm gates.                      
   There is a{kennels}specialising in  
 the training of greyhounds, which     
 attracts owners from all over Sussex  
 and the Home Counties.                
   There is a limited amount of{tourist
{related trade}such as bed and break-  
 fast, a farm providing cream teas, and
 a few farm-based caravans providing   
 self-catering holiday facilities.     
   There are two well-patronised{public
{houses,}The Bull and The Wheatsheaf,  
 in the area, the latter of which      
 provides meals.
