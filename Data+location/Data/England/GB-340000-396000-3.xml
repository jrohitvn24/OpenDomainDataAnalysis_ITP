		<content> In 1975 Kirkby industrial estate      
 employed 4,000 fewer than its peak of 
 1959 and by September 1981 the figure 
 had dropped to 14,500 employed in 262 
 firms.                                
 The Merseyside County Council         
 persuaded the government to make it an
 Industrial Improvement Area and some  
 firms were attracted but the overall  
 pattern has been one of decline.      
 The site was sold to Knowsley Council 
 in May 1982 and now in June 1985 the  
 workforce has dropped to 9000, a third
 of what it was just over ten years ago
 and with 144 of the original 380      
 hectares either derelict or vacant.   
 International and well_known firms    
 which have left the estate include    
 Fisher Bendix, Connolly (Blakeley)    
 subsidiary of BICC, Hygena,           
 Commonwealth Curtain Company and      
 Massey Ferguson.                      </content>
