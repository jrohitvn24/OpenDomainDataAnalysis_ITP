		<content> Kineton has a number of cottages,     
 many modernised, from the seventeenth 
 century and larger properties from the
 nineteenth and early twentieth century
 which formed the 'old' market town. In
 the 1930's the council houses of Mill 
 Crescent and King John's Road were    
 built, followed, after World War 2 by 
 those in Park Piece and Dene Close.   
  During the major{council}development 
 of Kineton Farm in 1962, known as St. 
 Peter's Road, Kineton's first flats   
 and old peoples' bungalows appeared.  
 The{private}development by Stubbings  
 on the site of Green Farm followed.   
 The Green Farm End and Shortacres     
 names retain a link with the past, as 
 do Castle Road and Fighting Close.    
 Privately owned houses number about   
 435 but the number increases as       
 tenants buy their council properties.
