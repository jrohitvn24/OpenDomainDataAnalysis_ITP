 SOME PEOPLE IN REDRUTH SPEND THEIR    
 SPARE TIME AT CADETS. THE CADET HUT   
 STANDS IN DRUMP ROAD.THERE ARE TWENTY 
 CADETS IN THE PLATOON.THEY ARE AGED 12
 TO 18.THEY GO ON MONDAYS AND          
 THURSDAYS. THEY HOLD PARADES AND ARE  
 TAUGHT TO MARCH, SHOOT, AND SURVIVE IN
 THE COUNTRYSIDE. THEY GO AWAY CAMPING,
 AND ARE TAUGHT CANOEING, CLIMBING,    
 AND TO PLAY SPORTS. THEY GO TO CAMP   
 FOR TWO WEEKS AND IT TAKES TWENTY     
 TENTS TO HOUSE THEM. SOMETIMES THEY   
 CAMP IN GERMANY. THEY HAVE A BAND WITH
 TEN DRUMMERS AND SIX BUGLERS. ONLY ONE
 OF THE BAND IS A GIRL. ALL THE CADETS 
 CARRY PENKNIVES, AND SOMETIMES GUNS,  
 BUT THEY ONLY USE THEM FOR TRAINING.  
 UP UNTIL NOW ALL CADETS WERE BOYS, BUT
 THEY HAVE JUST STARTED ALLOWING GIRLS 
 TO JOIN. THEY ENJOY IT AS MUCH AS THE 
 BOYS DO.                              </content>
