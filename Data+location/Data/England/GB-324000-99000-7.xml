		<title>07MAYDAY IN DALWOOD</title>
		<content>   On a day in May each year, children 
 from Dalwood School dance around the  
 maypole as part of Dalwood Fair       
 celebrations. The pole is decorated   
 with red, green and yellow ribbons.   
 When the children dance around the    
 pole, special patterns are made. The  
 junior dances are the Gypsies         
 Tent,Plaiting, the Barber's Pole and  
 the Spider's Web. The Infants make up 
 a dance of their own. The dancing     
 takes place outside the village inn,  
 the Tuckers' Arms. The children are   
 led in by Jack o'the Green, a local   
 man dressed in green leaves. The music
 is played by Mr Tony Drew on his      
 accordian. After the dancing there are
 stalls and amusements, and teas are   
 served by the W.I in the village Hall.
 The money raised goes towards the Fair
 Week in August.
