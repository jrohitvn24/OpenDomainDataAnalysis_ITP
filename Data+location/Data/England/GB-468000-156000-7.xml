		<content> There is only one vicar between three 
 Church of England Parishes in this    
 area.One of the parishes is           
 Rotherwick. It has an old church      
 which is made of stone. It was built  
 in the{13th. century}but modernised in
 the{16th. century.}The bell tower was 
 added in the{17th. century}out of red 
 brick, but the porch and the aisle are
 quite modern. Two of the windows date 
 from the first half of the{14th.      
{century}and the rest of them are      
 modern ones carved out of stone. It   
 has an organ and an old font. There   
 are 6 books containing information    
 about weddings,funerals,and baptisms. 
 The font is a plain cylindrical bowl  
 and is probably as old as the{        
{12th.century.}
