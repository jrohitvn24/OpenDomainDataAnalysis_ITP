		<title>15CHANGES IN FARMING</title>
		<content> On the farms over the past 20 years   
 there have been many changes, like new
 chemicals &amp; high technology, new      
 machinery, new crops &amp; new types of   
 fruit trees. Workers used to hoe the  
 crops by hand but weed killer sprays  
 are perhaps the main change. The work 
 force is only one third of the 1960   
 number. Oil seed rape is a fairly new 
 crop grown for oil (cooking oil &amp;     
 margarine). There are not so many     
 cherry orchards as there were, as it  
 costs too much to harvest them. The   
 farmers are now planting smaller trees
 which are easier to pick. The straw-  
 berries are picked in 12 pound trays &amp;
 are taken for freezing to be used     
 later for fruit yoghurt. Contractors  
 from New Zealand help shear the       
 thousands of sheep, some shearing 150 
 a day. Rabbits are becoming a great   
 pest again. These are times of change.</content>
