		<title>12BRAFFORD'S WOODS.</title>
		<content>  The farmer owns a large wood of      
 thirty seven acres. This wood is split
 into two. This is where a lot of      
 wildlife lives. They have partridges  
 and pheasants which are fed on a      
 nutritious grain and a compound with  
 protein in it. In the wood the        
 pheasants are kept in a run. When the 
 pheasants are fed crows and robins    
 come and feed on the grain as well.   
 Rabbits have become immune to disease.
 There used to be very few rabbits     
 because of myxomotosis but it does not
 bother them as much as it used to do. 
 They also have foxes but these are not
 as much trouble as the rabbits. The   
 Wold's Way also goes through the wood.
