		<title>15Local History, Scoutmoor.</title>
		<content> The part of the Rossendale Way beyond 
{Lime Leach House}(although now a      
 green, and often wet, track) was      
 originally an important road for      
 transporting coal in the early part of
 the 19th century from the collieries. 
 When Turn Village was built Scoutmoor 
 Colliery (on the moors to the left)   
 was started about 1800 and finally    
 closed in the 1960's. Much of the     
 abandoned machinery and winding gear  
 scattered on the moors serves as a    
 reminder of former times.
