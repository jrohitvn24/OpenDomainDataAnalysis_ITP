		<content>    In 1909, a man called Mr. Brierley 
planned out the land for the Haworth   
family.  The Haworth home looks like a 
17th Century home.  The house is now   
used as an Art Gallery which displays  
Tiffany glass, paintings, sculptures,  
art from schools, local artists work   
and paintings which once belonged to   
the Haworth family.                    
    Joseph Briggs from Accrington      
worked for Louis Comfort Tiffany in    
America and brought back some of the   
famous glass in 1938.  The gallery     
houses the biggest collection of       
Tiffany glass in Europe and must be    
seen by tourists. JKohn Ditchfield is a
Modern glass worker and makes similar  
glass which can be seen and bo in the  
gallery.  Enfield Training Centre which
looks after people suffering from      
Downes Syndrome had a exhibition       
recently.                              </content>
