		<title>14Transport In Mayfield.</title>
		<content>  Mayfield has only one bus service &amp;  
 no railway so public transport is very
 limit.The bus runs from Heathfield to 
 Tunbridge Wells passing through       
 Mayfield in each direction once an    
 hour.Unfortunately the service        
 finishes at about 7pm.so villagers    
 cannot use buses for any evening      
 activities.The nearest railway        
 stations are at Wadhurst &amp; Jarvis     
 Brooke about 5 miles away.Every       
 fortnight a coach service to          
 Eastbourne passes through Mayfield    
 collecting passengers at 10am. &amp;      
 returning them at 3pm.Mayfield also   
 has a Post Bus service;a mini_bus     
 which can carry abou 12 passengers. It
 runs twice a day from Tunbridge Wells 
 to Mayfield and return.Because public 
 transport is so limited most families 
 in Mayfield have a car &amp; many have    
 two.                                  </content>
