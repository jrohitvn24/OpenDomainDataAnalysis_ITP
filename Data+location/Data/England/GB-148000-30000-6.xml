		<title>06MARAZION MARSH</title>
		<content> The marsh is well known to            
 ornithologists. It is the first and   
 last stop for birds crossing the sea  
 on their Spring and Autumn migrations.
 Like many other British marshes,      
 parts have been drained for building  
 land. The marsh has a typical wetland 
 flora with many reeds and willowscrub.
 It formed because sand dunes block the
 river off from the sea. Herons, coot, 
 swans and gulls are some of the       
 resident bird population. Many waders 
 such as dunlin, greenshanks and       
 redshanks visit the marsh. Ducks      
 include shoveler, mallard and teal.   
 There can be large numbers of snipe at
 times. Migrants such as sedge warblers
 and reed buntings come to breed. Rare 
 visitors include Cetti's warblers and 
 bluethroats.
