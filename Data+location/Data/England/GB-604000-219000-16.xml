		<title>16Attitudes in Alresford</title>
		<content> In 1984, Alresford residents fought to
 save a favourite beauty spot in the   
 village. Cockaynes Wood,part of an an-
 cient Domesday Book Manor, was under  
 threat of being dug up for mineral ex-
 traction.Several residents were anx-  
 ious to preserve ancient trees and    
 woodland and popular picturesque foot-
 paths.Consequently letters of object- 
 tion were sent to the Parish Coucil   
 and Essex County Council calling for  
 the original planning consent, granted
 in 1953, to be revoked.               
  Some older Alresford residents tend  
 to  take a rather conservative att-   
 itude towards newcomers.Since the ex- 
 pansion of the village about sixteen  
 years ago, when several new estates   
 were built, many people have been     
 moving in from London.A few establish-
 ed residents feel that the Cockneys   
 are taking over Alresford.            </content>
