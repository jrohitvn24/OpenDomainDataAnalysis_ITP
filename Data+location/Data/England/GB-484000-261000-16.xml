		<title>16EARLS BARTON - SOCIETY</title>
		<content>Until 1970,Earls Barton appeared a very
fragmented community.New-comers and old
families made an "us and Them"         
situation.The Vicar saw 1970 as the    
anniversary of the building of the     
church tower (1000 years) and organised
with his parishioners the "Millenium"  
Festival which united the village and  
led to the development of many clubs   
and societies:Local History,Amateur    
Theatre,Music,Luncheon Clubs(which     
provide meals for those who normally   
eat alone),Youth clubs,Chess club,and  
other Sporting Clubs.There are groups  
linked to the various churches and     
several uniformed groups for children. 
The village tradition of eating Leek   
Pies is continued in annual Leek Pie   
Suppers.                               
The fragmented society of the sixties  
has grown into a well organised        
community.                             </content>
