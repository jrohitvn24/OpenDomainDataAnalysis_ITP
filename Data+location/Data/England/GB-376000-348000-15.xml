		<title>15COOPERS GREEN FARM</title>
		<content>Mr and Mrs Brassington have lived at   
Coopers Green Farm for exactly 50 years
this year.Parts of the house were built
in 1750,but the main parts of the house
between 150 and 200 years old.         
The farm is a small farm consisting of 
only 16 acres and therefore only two   
people work on the farm.The buildings  
and land of the farm have changed very 
little over the years,but one change   
has been to change production from milk
to beef.Both Mr and Mrs Brassington    
find it easy to run the farm and enjoy 
the work.                              
The farm has 15 beef cows,1 dog,3 cats,
25 ducks,4 peacocks,3male and 1 female,
25 guinea fowl and 15 hens.The peacocks
are the most valuable of the birds.
