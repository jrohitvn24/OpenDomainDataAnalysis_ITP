		<title>11FERGUSON PRINTERS</title>
		<content> Opened in 1824 by Joseph Ferguoen the 
 firm was at  first only a small       
 concern specialising in dyeing and    
 finishing cotton. However it was to   
 expand by the 1940's to be a major    
 employer with a work force of over    
 1200 men an  women.However today after
 numerous changes and cutbacks the firm
 employs just over 300 men and women   
 and concentrates its activities on    
 weaving dyeing and printing.          
 The firm today is owned by Vantona    
 Viyella which is one of the largest   
 textile groups in the country.However 
 the company still trades under the    
 name of Ferguson Printers specialising
 in the production of high quality     
 house hold textiles.                  
 Since 1983 significant capital        
 investment has been made at the Holme 
 Head works in new equipment.
