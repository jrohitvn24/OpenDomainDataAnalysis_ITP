		<content>{Romanies                              
{    }Our area has verges 6,8,10 metres
 wide,these make excellent stopping    
 places for travellingfolk.We often    
 have true Romanies(whose ancesters    
 orginated in the Himalayas in India)  
 passing through.They are often        
 travelling to or from a horse sale at 
 Stow on the Wold.They are a shy,      
 retiring people but we were able      
 to talk to the husband of the family  
 as he boiled water over a wood fire.  
 His caravans were wooden with         
 tarpaulin covers and wooden wheels    
 apart from the permeter which had a   
 covering of rubber.A daughter had     
 painted all the wood with intricate   
 pattern.The gipsy man used a catapult 
 for shooting rabbits and pheasants for
 food.Peg making time was near,the     
 willow was nearly ready but we saw as 
 they left on there two month journey. </content>
