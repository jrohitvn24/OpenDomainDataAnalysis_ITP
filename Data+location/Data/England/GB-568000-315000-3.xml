		<content> Rev Paul Bell has recently arrived in 
 the parish of East Winch and we       
 thought it would be interesting to    
 find out his thoughts on his new job  
 and the area.                         
 Rev Bell grew up in                   
 Newcastle_upon_Tyne. Then he went into
 the army. After some time he left the 
 army and decided to go to Africa to   
 teach french. He taught there for     
 twenty years in a place called Brande.
 He had decided to become a minister in
 the Church of England and returned to 
 a church in North London where he was 
 the curate.                           
 Then he came to Middleton and East    
 Winch in June 1985 to become the      
 vicar.
