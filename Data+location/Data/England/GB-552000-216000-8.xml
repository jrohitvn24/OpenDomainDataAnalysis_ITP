		<content>   There are currently six shops in the
 village: the Post Office and general  
 stores, the butcher's, the newsagent, 
 an electrical shop and an antique     
 shop; a further small shop building   
 housing a craft and gift business is  
 at present featuring a closing down   
 sale. In addition to the shops there  
 is a small nursery run from a bungalow
 near the bottom of Feathers Hill and  
 an apple orchard in the grounds of the
 house called 'Great Chalks' (the      
 former vicarage) from which apples are
 sold during the autumn.               
   In former years there were a number 
 of other shops in the village and     
 several buildings now occupied        
 solely as homes were once business    
 premises as well. House names such as 
 'The Old Forge' and 'Old Post House'  
 are everyday reminders of this.
