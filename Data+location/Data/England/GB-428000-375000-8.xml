		<content> A{village},{primary school}with 2     
 teachers and a headmaster serves our  
 area.Fifty pupils aged between 5 and  
 11 attend the school.The number of    
 pupils is decreasing due to an{ageing 
{population}and the advent of the{     
{smaller family}.Many of the children  
 live more than a mile away and so are 
 allowed a{free taxi}to school.The     
 school was built in 1894 and had its  
 first pupils in 1895.Recently  the    
 school has been modernised.Most of the
 children consume school dinners which 
 are cooked on the premises.The school 
 is named after an ancient trust set up
 from proceeds of local produce to pay 
 for a teacher.                        
  {Older children}are{bused}to the     
 local secondary schools in Dronfield.
