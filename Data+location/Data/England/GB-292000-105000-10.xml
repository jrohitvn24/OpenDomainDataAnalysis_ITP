		<title>10A WEEKDAY FOR JULIA</title>
		<content>                                       
 I'm Julia, aged 9. I get up at 7.30   
 and have cornflakes and orange juice. 
 I catch the school bus at 8.20. Today,
 after prayers at 9.00 we had a lady   
 teacher for science. After play and   
 tuckshop we returned to the hut to    
 write up our experiment. At noon there
 is dinner in the main school. Then    
 some of the oldest children have music
 lessons. Afternoon school (1.30-3.30) 
 ends with a story. I'm on the bus for 
 half an hour. Changed into play       
 clothes, I enjoy crisps, especially   
 pickled onion flavour. We have tea and
 watch T.V., then at 6.00 I get in and 
 shut the cows into their yard. I visit
 the neighbours to ride their Shetland 
 pony. From 7.30 till 8.30 I watch T.V.
 and then it's bedtime.
