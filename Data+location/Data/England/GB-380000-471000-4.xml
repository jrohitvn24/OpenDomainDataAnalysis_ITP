		<content> None of the farms are self-sufficient 
 and have to buy all their feed except 
 grass which is cut for hay in July.   
 Recently more grass has been made into
 silage, and this year baled in large  
 black plastic bags for the first time.
 Beef cows have superseded the milkers 
 and continental breeds are to be seen 
 among the traditional ones.  They are 
 kept loose in the new sheds all year  
 round or wintered in barns. The main  
 source of income is sheep farming.    
 Swaledale sheep are crossed with other
 types to prduce females for breeding  
 on the lowland farms and males for    
 meat in the autumn.  The sheep are    
 clipped in June.  The increased use of
 fertilizers has upset the balance of  
 nutrients in grass and more minerals  
 in supplementary feeds as well as     
 vaccines are necessary to keep        
 livestock healthy.                    </content>
