		<title>07Farming - Land Ownership</title>
		<content> The land in this area is mainly owner 
 occupied but there is one area which  
 contains parts of two small estates.  
 These estates still let parts to      
 tenant farmers but should a tenant    
 vacate his smallholding, the landlord 
 will takeover the land and farm it    
 himself with the rest of his estate.  
 The reason for this trend has come    
 about as a result of the Security of  
 Tenure Act.                           
                                       
 It has been seen that when the        
 landlord farms the land himself he    
 roots out some of the ancient hedges  
 to make the fields larger. At the same
 time the houses and buildings are     
 allowed to fall into ruin or the      
 properties are sold without the       
 associtated land to people from       
 outside the area as retirement or     
 holiday homes.                        </content>
