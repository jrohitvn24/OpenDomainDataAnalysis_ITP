		<title>13AGRICULTURE, WYKE AREA</title>
		<content>   Most of the agriculture carried out 
 in this area is that of dairy farming.
 The most common cattle are Friesian   
 The females are taken from their      
 mothers after birth and are fed       
 artificially, they will be kept for   
 the dairy herd.  The males are taken  
 for fattening into beef.  Most of the 
 fields are manured for Summer grazing.
   The main crops grown are for feed   
 for the cattle.  A lot of the grass is
 grown to be cut for silage for winter 
 feed.                                 
   Several small stables are to be     
 found in the area which are used by   
 local people for recreational         
 purposes.                             
   On smaller farms and small-holdings,
 some crops are grown for the markets  
 of Leeds, Bradford, Halifax and       
 Huddersfield.
