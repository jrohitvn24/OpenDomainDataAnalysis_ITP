		<title>081st.AUDLEY GIRL GUIDES</title>
		<content>In Audley Guides we have three patrols 
called Chaffinch,Swallow and White     
Heather.We meet every Monday night at  
7.3Opm till 9.00pm in Audley Church Hal
Our Guide leader is Mrs.Turner who     
organises games or quizzes or treasure 
hunts around the village.Our patrol    
leader is Samantha Lewis and at every  
meeting,she collects in our subs and   
any money for our patrol fund.She also 
gives us any information about trips   
and camps.                             
This year the Guides are celebrating   
their 75th anniversary and we had a    
special day to remember it. The        
celebration started at 6.30pm.When we  
arrived at the camp we gave the money  
in for our hamburgers which were going 
to be cooked on a barbeque.When we all 
had our candles lit we sang a song     
called "Join Hands".We then blew our   
canles out and moved nearer the fire.  </content>
