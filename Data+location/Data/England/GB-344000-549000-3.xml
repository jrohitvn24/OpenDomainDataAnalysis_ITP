		<title>03BRICKYARDS POND,COTEHILL</title>
		<content> Near the brickyards there is a place  
 where you can fish.The brickyards is a
 place where they used to make bricks  
 for houses.You are not allowed to walk
 round.You are only allowed to go in if
 you are going to fish.There is a sign 
 that says "Tresspassers will be       
 prosecuted".People used to be able to 
 walk round.It used to be a little     
 pond.I used to get tadpoles there.They
 dug up the sides to make the pond     
 deeper.It had lots of trees round it  
 but all the trees have cut down.Then  
 they pumped more water into the pond  
 then they breed some fish then put    
 them into the pond.You have to pay to 
 get in.It costs Â£4 to catch two fish  
 per day and Â£8 to catch four fish.
