		<title>05Bakewell Fair</title>
		<content>   Bakewell fair comes once a year in  
 July.  It stays for one week, during  
 carnival week.  The  fair is held on  
 Bakewell market place and takes up a  
 lot  of  space.  Many people come to  
 the fair  and parking  becomes a bit  
 of a problem.                         
   The travelling fair people stay in  
 caravans on the Showground while the  
 fair is in Bakewell.   It takes them  
 about  a  week  to  put  up  all the  
 roundabouts and  sideshows.  Some of  
 the rides  include  the Waltzer, the  
 Skid,  Big  Wheel,  Helter  Skelter,  
 Cyclone,  and  Haunted House.  Among  
 the  sideshows  are  stalls  selling  
 Candy Floss and  Toffee Apples,  and  
 many  different  games  of skill and  
 chance.                               
   It's great fun!
