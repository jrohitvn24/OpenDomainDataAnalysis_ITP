		<content> The area surrounding Barton Broad is  
 mainly wetland. Alder carr and dense  
 reed beds provide homes for a variety 
 of wildlife. By the side of the       
 footpaths ragged robin, yellow flag   
 and orchids mingle with hogweed.      
 Milkweed also grows attracting the    
 rare and colourful Swallowtail        
 butterfly. Along the banks of the     
 dykes there can be found stacks of    
 freshly cut reeds and sedge for       
 thatching. In and around the dykes are
 small frogs, water spiders and damsel 
 fly larvae. In the water are roach,   
 bream and minnows. The broad is also a
 haven for birdlife. Terns perch on the
 navigation posts. On the water itself 
 are grebes, geese, moorhens, coots,   
 swans and ducks. In the shallower     
 water herons stalk. Occasionally pairs
 of marsh harriers can be seen flying  
 over the reeds.                       </content>
