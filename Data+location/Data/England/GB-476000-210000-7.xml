		<content>Dinton church was built in the 11th    
century. Some of the outside walls are 
crumbly and there are lots of fossils  
on the top bit of the wall.            
There are six windows round the church 
w you can look into.                   
The church yard has alot of gravestones
and there is a cobbled path up to the  
big wooden church door. The church is  
quite big and has twelve rows of seats 
inside.                                
The church has a tower which you can   
see Dinton village from.
