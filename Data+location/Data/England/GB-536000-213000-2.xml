		<content> The centre in {Marsh Lane,Ware}has    
 been established for 12 years.At first
 it was run by the Herts. Association  
 for the Disabled,as a workshop.It was 
 taken over three years ago by         
{Hertfordshire Social Services.}The    
 centre is for people aged from 17     
 years to retirement and its aim is    
 to live as independently as possible  
 and learn various skills including    
 printing,painting,wrought iron work   
 and gardening.They sell the things    
 they make to raise money for the      
 centre.                               
     Outings to pubs,parks,the seaside 
 and other day centres are             
 organised.Throughout the week the     
 centre holds different activities such
 as yoga,tapestry and art classes.Some 
 people stay for longer than others so 
 they have more time to learn how to do
 things.                               </content>
