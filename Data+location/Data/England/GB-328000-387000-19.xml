		<content>{ Parents Against Drug Abuse}have rooms
 on  top  of a shop  where  parents  of
 children  who have a drugs problem can
 go to get help and advice. They have a
 24 hour phone_in service where  people
 can  ring  for information or help  in
 trying to combat,and get off drugs.   
                                       
 "We  hope  we  will soon get a special
 Rehbilitation  Centre where people can
 get more help. We  have  been  putting
 pressure on the local  Council to show
 where there is a drugs problem, and to
 try  and get the penalties for selling
 drugs increased."                     
                                       
 When  referring  to  the  difficulties
 that face a drug addict it can be said
{                                      
{"You can only say you are an ex_addict
{ on your deathbed."
