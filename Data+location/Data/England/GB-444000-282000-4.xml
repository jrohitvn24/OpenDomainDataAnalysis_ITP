		<content> In the grounds of Brockhurst Middle   
 School there is a piece of land of    
 about two acres which has been set    
 aside as a nature reserve.It has been 
 worked on for about two years but was 
 officially opened on 12th.July 1985 by
 Colin Potter a local conservation     
 enthusiast.                           
  The idea to conserve this area for   
 the school came from a parent,        
 Mrs. Sarah Haine who has been the     
 driving force in the development of   
 the area.We have had help from many   
 organisations the main ones being     
{W.A.R.N.A.C.T.}and{WATCH.}The ground  
 was naturaly wet and therefore        
 provided a good opportunity to create 
 areas which  would be habitable by    
 many small creatures which would in   
 turn attract birds as well as larger  
 animals.
