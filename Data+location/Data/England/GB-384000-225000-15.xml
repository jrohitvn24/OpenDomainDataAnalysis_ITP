		<content>   The houses in Lower Apperley  are   
 spread out with large gardens or      
 fields in between. This is called     
 dispersed settlement. Most of the     
 buildings seemed to be made of bricks 
 with tile roofs, though some were of  
 black and white half timber           
 construction. Electricity did not     
 arrive until the 1940's. The largest  
 house lying in wooded grounds is      
 Apperley Court. The farms lie on the  
 edge of the spur of land close to the 
 secondary road. In this way they have 
 a mixture of drier arable fields and  
 improved pasture on the slopes above  
 the 10 metre contour and some water   
 meadows below it. TO the north and    
 below Apperley Court there is a wide  
 drainage channel called Handkerchief  
 Pool.
