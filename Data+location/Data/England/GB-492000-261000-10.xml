		<title>10The People</title>
		<content>   Many of the inhabitants are retired.
 Quite a lot work on the land or have  
 work associated with agriculture such 
 as repairing farm machinery,making and
 selling machinery.  The rest of the   
 people follow a wide variety of       
 occupations including employment in   
 the boot &amp; shoe trade, insurance, the 
 professions, shops and offices. These 
 people commute to Northampton,        
 Bedford,Rushden and Wellingborough.   
 Some travel to other parts of Britain 
 and Europe.  A few women are employed 
 locally at the garden centre in       
 Podington and at Hinwick Hall.  There 
 appears to be little unemployment.    
   Nearly all the people said they     
 liked living in the area because of   
 the peace and quiet away from hustle  
 and bustle, the rural atmosphere, the 
 friendliness and the community spirit.
