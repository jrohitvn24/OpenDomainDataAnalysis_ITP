		<title>16PLAYGROYND AT ASHTON ROAD</title>
		<content> The playground on Ashton Road was     
 created about four years ago on the   
 site of a disused factory. The lower  
 walls of the factory were retained to 
 surround the playspace and the inside 
 surfaces of the walls have been       
 brightly painted.  The outer surfaces 
 are very unsightly and resemble a     
 ruined industrial building. Inside the
 playground there are facilities for   
 children of all ages - a slide,       
 swings and areas for games such as    
 football and cricket.  Unfortunately, 
 the area is not very well maintained, 
 and the whole of the ground is        
 littered with loose stones and broken 
 glass. The high surrounding walls do  
 provide cover for the badly behaved,  
 especially on dark evenings, and this 
 has caused friction with local people 
 who live close by.
