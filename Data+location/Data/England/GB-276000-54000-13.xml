		<title>13Life on a Dairy Farm 1</title>
		<content> My Dad has got a farm in our study    
 area.  The farm is about 100 acres,   
 and we have got a herd of pedigree    
{Friesian cows.                        
                                       
 My Dad has to get up very early in the
 morning to milk the cows.  We have a  
 'Herring-bone'{milking parlour}which  
 takes eight cows at a time.  The cows 
 are milked by electris milking machine
 but it still takes over two hours to  
 milk all sixty cows.                  
                                       
 The milk is cooled and collected in a 
 large{refridgerated tank.} I think we 
 produce about a thousand litres.  The 
 milk is collected by the{milk lorry   
 and taken to the{Unigate Dairy}in     
{Totnes,}which is about three miles    
 away.                                 
                                       
                                       </content>
