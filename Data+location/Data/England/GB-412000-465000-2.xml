		<title>02A day in the life of Ellen</title>
		<content>  I get up at about 7.15 am and have my
 breakfast of toast with peanut butter.
 At 8.30am Granny takes me to the top  
 of our lane to catch the school bus.  
 We arrive at school at 9.00am. We play
 in the playground until the bell goes 
 at 9.15am. After registration, we do  
 maths and english. We then have a     
 fifteen minute playtime. After that we
 do more maths, english or topic work. 
 For lunch, we go across the road to   
 the Memorial Hall. I have a packed    
 lunch of sandwiches, crisps, a drink  
 and fruit. We play games in the       
 playground until 1.15 pm. In the      
 afternoon, we do art and craft.We have
 another playtime at 2.25pm. School    
 ends at 3.45pm. I usually go home on  
 the school bus. On Mondays I go to    
 chess club and the Headmaster takes me
 home. I get to bed about 10.00 pm.
