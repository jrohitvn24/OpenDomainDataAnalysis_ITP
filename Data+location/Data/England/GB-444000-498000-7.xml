		<title>07MOUNT GRACE PRIORY</title>
		<content> Mount Grace Priory G.R.448985 was     
 built in 1398 and belonged to the     
 Carthusian Order of monks.It is now in
 ruins,some of the stone having been   
 used in local buildings.Each monk had 
 his own cell rather like a house and  
 they lead solitary lives.Food was     
 given through a hatch by a lay brother
 and they attended just 2 services a   
 day.Every monk wore a sack cloth shirt
 to remind them of the discomforts of  
 life.For the past 30 years the priory 
 has been open to the public,part of   
 the National Trust.Mr.Haines has been 
 curator for 18 years.On average 18000 
 people visit Mount Grace each year but
 1985 has been a bad year with only    
 about 13000 visitors. Many come from  
 abroad as this is a fine example of a 
 Carthusian priory.Digs are still      
 taking place and relics found can be  
 seen in the museum at the priory.     </content>
