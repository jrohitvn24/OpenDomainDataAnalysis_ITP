		<content> The firm was founded 3\ years ago in a
 lounge in Warrington. Six months later
 they moved to Frodsham, recently      
 opening two showrooms in Chester and  
 Manchester. With a turnover of 3.5    
 million pounds they employ 45. Only   
 10% of their business is retail with  
 45% dealing with schools and 45%      
 industry. They have sole rights to    
 sell the new Amstrad CPC 664 to       
 schools. They have a large service    
 department, hoping to finish repairs  
 in under 2 weeks, mobile engineers    
 will visit firms to effect on the spot
 repairs. A design section develops new
 products, these being assembled in a  
 part of the service department. Disc  
 drives are also assembled here, the   
 parts being manufactured elsewhere.   
 The bulk of their business is mail    
 order and Prestel has just been       
 installed to improve efficiency.      </content>
