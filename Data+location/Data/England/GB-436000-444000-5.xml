		<content> Three quarters of these were the      
 Evening Post and the second most      
 popular was the Yorkshire Post with 5%
 of total sales.Others are Daily       
 Express and Daily Telegraph with 4%   
 the Daiy Mail 3%,Wetherby News and    
 Sun,Sporting Life,The Times,The       
 Financial Times,Daily Star all at 1%. 
 The least popular was the New Journal 
 of which he only sold 1 copy per      
 week.Its quite surprising that there  
 is such a large percentage of evening 
 papers sold as opposed to papers      
 delivered early in the day.           
 On the whole,Collingham is quite a    
 quiet village with the main news being
 car crashes which is not suprising as 
 there is a main road (A58) running    
 through the centre of the village.
