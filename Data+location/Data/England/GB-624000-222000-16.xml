		<content> We went to the naze to see how many   
 different kinds of birds we could     
 find.We found 11 different birds and  
 they were,a Swallow,Skylark,Black     
 Headed Seagull,Meadow Pipit,Mistle    
 Thrush,Kestrel,Wood Pigeon,Magpie,    
 Swift,Male Linnet,Male Blackbird,Snow 
 Bunting and a Common Gull.A lot of the
 time we were looking out for a        
 Sparrowhawk which are quite common    
  in this area but we did not see      
 one.The most common bird we saw was   
 the Wood Pigeon it is the largest     
 Pigeon in the region and the most     
 common Pigeon in Britain.
