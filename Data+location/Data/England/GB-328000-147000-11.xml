 Apex ponds were originally big clay   
 pits that were very important to the  
 brick works.A railway once came to the
 ponds to collect the tiles and bricks 
 which once came from the important    
 local brick works.The trains came to  
 export the brick around the           
 country.The works fired the brick in  
 kilns which had shelves to lay the    
 brick on.After the bricks had been    
 fired they were taken out of the and  
 stored ready for transporting.        
 Later on,the brick works were         
 demolished,and the rubble was used to 
 surface Apex Ponds car park.          
 Apex is now a recreation              
 area,fishermen and Sea Scouts use the 
 ponds.A big{adventure playground}is   
 being built nearby.
