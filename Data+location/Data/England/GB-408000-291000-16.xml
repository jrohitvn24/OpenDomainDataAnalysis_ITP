		<title>16FAMILY LIFE ERDINGTON</title>
		<content> For the majority of families the day  
 begins around 7 a.m. when everyone    
 gets ready for work or school.  Very  
 few families sit down for a meal in   
 the morning and many - approximately a
 third - do not eat breakfast at all.  
 For those who do, this is invariably  
 taken in the form of cereal and/or    
 toast.  Most family activities take   
 place in the evening and at week-ends.
 All families have a television and    
 many possess a video recorder.  On    
 fine evenings many of the children    
 play outside with friends, while      
 adults tend to have hobbies such as   
 reading, knitting and sewing.  Many   
 families keep pets; popular ones being
 fish, cats, dogs and caged birds.     
 Dispite the loss of contact which this
 generation often has with the extended
 family, most people retain a sense of 
 family life in a small unit.          </content>
