		<title>06Sunnyside House</title>
		<content>Sunnyside is a huge house in Mayfield  
which was built for the Simpson        
family in 1872, at that time they owned
the local mill. It was sold in the     
1930s.for $1,000 and was turned into   
flats and a guest house. Most of the   
landscaped grounds were sold in the    
1950s but it was not until the 1970s   
that building permission was granted   
for private housing to be erected on   
this land. So far 26 houses and        
bungalows have been built in a variety 
of architect designed styles. They sell
at the moment for between $60,000 and  
$70,000. The original trees still      
remain. There is a Weeping Beech, a    
Redwood Cedar ,of Lebanon, several     
Chestnuts and Holm Oaks.
