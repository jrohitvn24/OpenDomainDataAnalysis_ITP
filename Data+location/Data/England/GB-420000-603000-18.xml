		<content> There are no schools within the survey
 area which means that all children    
 have to travel to school from the age 
 of five.State education is based on   
 a three tier comprehensive system.The 
 youngest children are collected by bus
 and taken to school in Acklington,a   
 small village school with a falling   
 roll.If this school closed the        
 children would have further to        
 travel.At 9 years children transfer to
 a middle school in Amble and at 13    
 years to a high school also in        
 Amble.The school bus is the only bus  
 serving the scattered community.      
 Children leave home as early as 8.00am
 and arrive home after 4.00pm.Lack of  
 transport makes it difficult for      
 children to participate in extra      
 curricular activities at school or    
 youth clubs.
