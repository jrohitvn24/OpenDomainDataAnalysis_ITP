		<title>06The School Day</title>
		<content> We begin each school day with assembly
 when the whole school meets in the    
 hall.We have some hymns and prayers   
 and sometimes a story. First thing    
 Monday morning after assembly we have 
 spellings. Then we have Maths up till 
 break. After break,during summer we   
 have swimming. The rest of the lessons
 we have during the week               
 are;english,history,science,reading,se
 wing,using the                        
 computer,P.E.,games,writing,art and   
 craft. We sometimes use television and
 do some work about the programme. We  
 do projects as well. We all do some   
 research about things. We have a      
 sports day when everybody takes part  
 in games and races. Sometimes in maths
 we use calculators but usually we     
 calculate with our brains. We listen  
 to a radio programme called In the    
 News which is about the weeekly news. </content>
