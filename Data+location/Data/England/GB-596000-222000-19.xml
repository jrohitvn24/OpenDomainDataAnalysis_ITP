		<title>19Colchester's Mercury Statue.</title>
		<content>{  "The Mercury Statue"}was found in a 
 shed at Gosbecks farm Stanway, having 
 been dug up earlier, in 1948.         
   It turned up whilst a ploughman was 
 ploughing  the field. It was one of   
 the most important works of art ever  
 found in Britain. It had proved that  
 the {"Gallo Roman Temple"}was in      
 Chestnut field, only a few 100 yards  
 from where it was found.              
   The figure is 22 inches high while  
 some other statues are up to 10 inches
 high. It represented a God to the     
 Romans. The arms are missing below    
 the elbows, but we are fairly certain 
 that it could be  Mercury because     
 the hands originally held the Caduceus
 and a purse which he used as his      
 symbols. The right leg is damaged at  
 the knee because it was struck by the 
 plough when it was found. The position
 of the  God was standing on a Globe.  </content>
