		<content>{Changes in everyday life in Blyth.}   
 The television was a big change.The   
 women go to work now but before they  
 stopped to do the housework.Today most
 people have cars and telephones.      
{                                      
{Street Scenes 20 years ago.}          
 The village is tidier now and there   
 are more trees.60 years ago all the   
 cottages had flower gardens in the    
 front and hanging plants in the       
 window.The pavements were cobblestone.
{                                      
{Use of the motor car.}                
 The motor car made many changes to    
 Blyth because on Sundays it is very   
 busy because of the market and the    
 people go out in their cars.People    
 that live in Blyth who have cars can  
 travel very far to work.People cannot 
 join in with the village things       
 because they work too far away.       </content>
