		<content>     The Dependents                    
  There is a brown gate down on the    
 west side of London Road near the     
 Antique Shop in Northchapel which     
 leads to a chapel with a brown door.  
 That chapel belongs to the small      
 religious group called the Dependents.
 There are only eight people in this   
 group and they have a nickname of the 
 'Cokelers' because they always offer  
 their guests a cup of cocoa.          
  There was once hundreds of Cokelers  
 but they became fewer over the years  
 because members were asked not to     
 marry or have children.They believed  
 that large families bred poverty.They 
 also disliked alcohol and served cocoa
 to entice outsiders to their meetings.
  The Dependents give sorrow at birth  
 and rejoice in death.                 
  They were,and still are,a much       
 respected sect in the village.        </content>
