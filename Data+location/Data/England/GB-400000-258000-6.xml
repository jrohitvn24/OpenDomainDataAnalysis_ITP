		<content> There are 107 dwellings in the area   
 and 229 people on the Electoral       
 Register. Those with children average 
 2 per family and the estimated        
 population is in the region of 350.   
                                       
 Middle class families moved to the    
 area from other parts of the county to
 live in the country and yet be in easy
 reach of facilities. Friends and      
 families tend to live out of the      
 district and therefore these people   
 feel no strong sense of community.    
                                       
 Older inhabitants of the area tend to 
 be the farming families who have lived
 in the region for many years, sons    
 taking over the family concern and    
 older parents still living close by.  
 There is an indication that the       
 present generation is not inclined    
 towards this trend.                   </content>
