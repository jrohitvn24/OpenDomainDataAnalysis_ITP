		<title>15Wormleighton the boundaries</title>
		<content> There are of course boundaries made by
 roads running through the area and the
 hedgerows are usually interspersed    
 with trees. A feature found here is   
 the double hedgerow between fields    
 also interplanted with hardwood trees.
 In many places this was the recognised
 method of marking county boundaries   
 but around Wormleighton the purpose of
 these was to provide timber. In a     
 letter to Cardinal Wolsey's Commission
 of Enguiry of 1517 John Spencer wrote 
 "There was no wood nor timber growing 
 within twelve or fourteen miles and   
 the poor folk had to burn the straw   
 that their cattle should live by".    
 John Spencer was therefor the         
 originator of the double boundaries   
 still in existence today.             
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
