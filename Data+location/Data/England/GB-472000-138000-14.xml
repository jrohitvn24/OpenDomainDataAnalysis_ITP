		<title>14Our School In Holybourne</title>
		<content>    Our school is a primary school.    
 It was founded by Thomas Andrews in   
 1719, and we think it's the{oldest}   
 free primary school for{girls and boys
 in England.  It has always been a     
 school ever since it was built in     
 Georgian times.                       
                                       
    The name of our school is{Andrew's 
{Endowed Primary School.} Our school is
 a church school and the vicar of      
 Holybourne  comes once a week to talk 
 to us.                                
                                       
    Our school has got five classrooms,
 but one has been changed into a       
{Resources Room}as there are now only  
 four classes of children.             
                                       
    We have got a headmaster and three 
 teachers.
