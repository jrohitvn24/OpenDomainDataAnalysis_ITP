		<title>18TRAFFIC SURVEY 1/7/85</title>
		<content>On July 1st we went out to take another
traffic survey to see whether the      
traffic had increased because of the   
Royal Show. There were lots of light   
goods vehicles on Gibbet Hill, but     
there were more(32) on the bypass. The 
most common vehicles on the bypass were
the heavy goods vehicles.We found that 
the traffic on the bypass had increased
as it had at Gibbet Hill. Most of the  
cars had Royal Show stickers on their  
windscreens.One coach load of people   
going into Coventry had come from the  
show. The number of motor-bikes had    
increased-4 on Gibbet Hill,6 on the    
bypass. There were no bicycles on the  
bypass,4 at Gibbet Hill(it was a hot   
sunny day). On the bypass we counted   
571 cars compared with 244 on Gibbet   
Hill.
