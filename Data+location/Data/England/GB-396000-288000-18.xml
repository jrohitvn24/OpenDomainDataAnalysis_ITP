		<title>18TURNERS'S HILL QUARRIES</title>
		<content>  There are several quarries around    
 Turner's Hill, which have been or     
 are still in use.                     
  Turner's Hill is a very prominant    
 landmark in the local area, dominating
 the southern section of the block. It 
 is part of the main watershed of      
 England.                              
  The rock quarried from the ground is 
 volcanic -dolerite- and is known      
 locally as 'Rowley Rag'. It is used   
 mainly for road making and is         
 transported long distances to be used.
 Once the quarries have ceased to be   
 used, they are filled with waste      
 materials and finally landscaped.     
  It is proposed by the local authority
 that one of the large quarries will   
 still be used for the next 20 years   
 and then it will take another 20 years
 for the reclaimation to be completed.
