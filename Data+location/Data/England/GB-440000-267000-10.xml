		<title>10Marton Museum</title>
		<content> Marton Museum contains a lot of       
 country tools and items from the      
 Victorian and Edwardian times. It is  
 a privately owned museum which has    
 been opened to the public for 20 years
 Everything within its walls has been  
 collected from a ten mile radius.     
     Inside,one is conducted through   
 different sections.They cover law en- 
 forcement,household equipment and lace
 and hat making.There are examples of  
 Edwardian costume.                    
     In the agricultural section we saw
 many pieces of farm machinery         
 eg.ploughs and animal traps.We saw the
 cruel teeth and learned that catching 
 poachers with man traps only became   
 illegal in the 19th century.In the    
 dairy was an interesting collection to
 do with butter making.                
     The museum is of immense interest 
 to anyone concerned with our heritage.</content>
