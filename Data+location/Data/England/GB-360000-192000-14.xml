		<content> river from Lydney on the old Matilda. 
 The coal was taken to a yard at the   
 back of an old cottage which has now  
 been knocked down, it cost 9d. per    
 bag,people collected it in old prams  
 and such like.  A shop was next to the
 Methodist Chapel, behind it was a     
 place for stray cattle.               
   A special date he remembers is the  
 Oldbury Fair, then it was a very big  
 occasion, held in front of the two    
 pubs. They had Oldbury Tart, cockles, 
 brandy snaps and a coconut shy.       
   He did a lot of salmon fishing, with
 putchers, a special basket for        
 catching salmon, but now the Power    
 Station is built on top of four of    
 those places.  When he was older he   
 worked there for 10 years helping to  
 build the reservoir.  When he was     
 young he was very religious but now he
 hardly ever goes to Church.           </content>
