		<content>   There is a village Post Office which
 is open 6 days a week.  It sells      
 sweets and stationery as well as      
 stamps.  There is a morning and       
 afternoon collection of mail from the 
 6 post boxes in the village.  There   
 are 2 Post Ladies who ride bicycles   
 who deliver the morning post to       
 houses.  The afternoon delivery is    
 made by a Postman in a van.           
                                       
   The majority of the population have 
 their own private telephone.  For     
 those who are without a phone there   
 are 3 public telephone boxes for      
 anyone to use although they are not in
 very good repair.
