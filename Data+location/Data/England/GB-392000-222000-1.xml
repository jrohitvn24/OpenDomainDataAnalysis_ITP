 well-known stores. Of particular note 
 is the recently constructed Regent

 Theatre and is linked to the          
 Promenade,a beautiful tree-lined      
 avenue,originally built as an elegant 
 residential parade,now affording      
 exclusive{shopping.}Typical of        
 Cheltenham's{leisure}areas is the     
 Imperial Gardens overlooked by the    
 Town Hall and Queen's Hotel. Nearby is
 the exclusive Montpellier area with   
 its famous caryatids. Close by is the 
 Cheltenham Ladies College, one of the 
 town's several higher{educational}
