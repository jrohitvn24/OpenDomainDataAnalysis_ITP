		<content> Emily's family have lived in Long Mar-
 ton for seven and a half years.Her    
 father paints and her mother runs an  
 antique shop in Carlisle and sometimes
 works with the National Opera Company 
 which she once did full time.         
    Her father paints with oil.He works
 whenever he can and paints many diff- 
 erent things,including a picture of   
 Emily and a self-portrait.He has      
 painted abroad as well as in England  
 but has only been painting full time. 
    Her mother bought the materials and
 supervised the making of costumes for 
 the Opera and still helps them part   
 time.She says it is nerve wracking and
 tiring but great fun.She was working  
 full time with the Opera for eight    
 years but never worked abroad.        
    She has a collection of costumes   
 which we borrow and alter for school  
 plays.                                </content>
