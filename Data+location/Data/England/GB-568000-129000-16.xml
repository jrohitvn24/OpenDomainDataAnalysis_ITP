		<content>  Bewl Bridge Reservoir, the largest   
 piece of truly inland water between   
 London and the South Coast, falls     
 partly within this block and Ticehurst
 is one of the nearest residential     
 areas to it. With a perimeter of 15   
 miles it provides facilities for      
 walking and riding as well as many    
 water sports and a wildlife reserve.  
  Out of a survey of 25 ten and eleven 
 year olds, only three made children   
 use it frequently and twenty use less 
 often than once a month. The main     
 reasons for not going more often were 
 because they are not allowed and have 
 difficulty in getting there. When they
 do go there it is mainly to walk      
 although 8 go fishing, 4 bird         
 watching, 3 sail and 1 goes horse     
 riding. When we asked what use their  
 parents made of the resevoir this was 
 very similar.                         </content>
