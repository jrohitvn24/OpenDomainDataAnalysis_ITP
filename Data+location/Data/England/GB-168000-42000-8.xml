		<content> In conclusion it might be generalised 
 that the average business on the {    
{CARDREW INDUSTRIAL ESTATE, REDRUTH,   
{CORNWALL,}is the main branch, with 18 
 employees, 12 of whom are men and 6   
 women, 1 in management, 4 clerical, 6 
 skilled and 7 unskilled jobs. Most of 
 these would have been recruited from  
 the Redruth area, a school leaver     
 would have been employed during the   
 past 2 years, training would have been
 offered within the business but not   
 outside. The raw material will be     
 obtained from parts of Britain outside
 Cornwall and the product would be     
 marketed within Cornwall, being       
 delivered through the firm's own      
 transport system.
