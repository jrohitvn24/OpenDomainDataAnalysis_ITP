		<content>  The 19th century brought rapid change
 to Ripley.Local coal and iron mines   
 led to the openinmg of many new       
 factories in the area.This meant that 
 many{new houses}had to be built to    
 house the new population.             
  In 1793 the{Cromford canal}was opened
 and connected to the network of canals
 running to Birmingham and London.This 
 allowed the carrying of iron from the 
 Butterley Ironworks and coal,limestone
 corn and timber.                      
  New{turnpike roads}entered Ripley    
 from several directions with a toll   
 gate at each entrance to Ripley.With  
 the heavy increase in modern traffic a
 by-pass was opened in 1977 and a      
 further by-pass was opened in 1985.   
  In 1974{local government}was         
 re-organised and absorbed into the    
 Amber Valley District Council.
