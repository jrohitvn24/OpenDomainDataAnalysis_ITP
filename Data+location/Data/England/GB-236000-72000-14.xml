		<title>14CORNISH HEDGEROWS</title>
		<content> THROUGHOUT THE SEASONS OF THE YEAR,   
 ONE OF THE MOST STRIKING ASPECTS OF   
 THE AREA IS THE HEDGEROWS. THIS IS DUE
 TO THE COUNCIL POLICY OF CUTTING THE  
 HEDGES ONLY ONCE DURING THE YEAR AND  
 THE LIMITED USE OF CHEMICAL SPRAYS. IN
{SPRING,}PRIMROSES AND DAFFODILS ARE   
 FOUND IN ABUNDANCE ALONG WITH         
 STITCHWORT AND CELANDINES. BLUEBELLS, 
 VIOLETS AND RED CAMPION FOLLOW IN     
 PROFUSION.{SUMMER}SEES FOXGLOVES,     
 SCABIOUS, ROSE-BAY WILLOW-HERB, VETCH 
 AND NUMEROUS OTHER WILD FLOWERS       
 COLOURING THE HEDGEROWS.{AUTUMN}BRINGS
 DIFFERENT COLOURS TO THE HEDGES WITH  
 THE CHANGING LEAVES AND THE BLACK-    
 BERRIES, ELDERBERRIES, SLOES, HIPS AND
 HAWS WHICH PROVIDE ADEQUATE FOOD FOR  
 THE BIRDS, INSECTS AND SMALL MAMMALS. 
 IN{WINTER}THE HEDGES ARE BARE EXCEPT  
 FOR THE EVERGREEN IVY AND HOLLY AND   
 THEIR GRANITE STRUCTURE CAN BE SEEN.  </content>
