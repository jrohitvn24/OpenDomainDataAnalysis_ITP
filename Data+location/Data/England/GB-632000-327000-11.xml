		<title>11THE INTERIOR OF HONING HALL</title>
		<content> On March 5th.,1985,we visited Honing  
 Hall the home of Mr.and Mrs. Cubitt.  
 It is not open to the public. On      
 entering the Hall we firstly descended
 some stone steps to the cellars. Some 
 wine is kept down there, but the      
 cellars are mainly used for the       
 storing of old furniture, like a      
 'slipper' bath, and garden furniture  
 and sporting equipment. On the ground 
 floor is the kitchen, entrance hall,  
 dining room, living room and study,   
 and housekeeper's quarters.We saw the 
 bell system once used to summon       
 servants to all manner of rooms. On   
 the first floor was a splendid library
 and bedrooms, with bedrooms on the    
 second floor and servants quarters on 
 the very top floor.We saw items       
 connected with the mailing of letters 
 from the hall, portraits of the       
 family's ancestors and militaria.     </content>
