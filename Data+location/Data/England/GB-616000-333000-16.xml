		<content> Richard writes that in his spare time 
 his main interest is swimming.He      
 trains three or four times a week and 
 most weekends he goes to swimming     
 galas.These are big get-togethers     
 where various teams e.g Norwich swans,
 Norwich penguins,Kings Lynn gladiators
 and his own team Aylsham Vikings      
 complete against each other.By        
 belonging to the swimming Club he has 
 made many friends from other parts of 
 Norfolk .His dad,Douglas Poyuton,is   
 the chief coach.                      
 Besides swimming he enjoyes Bicycle   
 Motor Cross _B.M.X.This is a very     
 thrilling sport with two sections-    
 racing and freestyle.The racing means 
 the riders ride their bikes as fast as
 they can round a specially made track 
 with bumps and jumps.Freestyle is a   
 contest of tricks where the rider uses
 bike to jump or ride on his back wheel</content>
