		<title>05EAST BURNHAM COTTAGE</title>
		<content>East Burnham Cottage does not now stand
but is part of another building known  
as East Burnham House.It is situated to
the south of Stag Hill.In 1838 it was  
owned by George Grote.He was the author
of "Standard history of Greece" written
in the cottage.Mrs.Grote his wife,is   
said to have complained about the state
of the roads and the footpaths,and the 
beer sold in "The Stag and Crown".She  
was a musical person and invited many  
famous friends to the cottage like     
Frederic Chopin(1810,1849) and Felix   
Mendelssohn(1809,1847).Mendelssohn,the 
great composer often visited the       
Beeches.Once while staying at East     
Burnham Cottage he got lost in the     
Beeches and had to be found by a search
party.His favourite spot(which is now  
named after him)is called              
"Mendelssohn's slope".
