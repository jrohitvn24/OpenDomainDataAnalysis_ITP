		<title>16Population Spread</title>
		<content>  The population of the area is quite  
 sparce with the majority of people    
 living, naturally, in the village of  
 Bridgerule.                           
  The approximate number of residents  
 in the village is 350 of whom about 60
 are under eighteen years of age.      
  There are many farms in the area     
 although several of the farmhouses    
 have been split to accommodate more   
 than one family.                      
  In the area of Borough there are     
 seventeen residents, at Borough Cross 
 nine but at Shernick the farm is half 
 a mile from any neighbours. This      
 dispersal of population is typical of 
 a mainly farming community and the    
 village acts as a focal meeting place 
 as does the nearby market town of     
 Holsworthy where local residents and  
 farmers meet on market day each       
 Wednesday.                            </content>
