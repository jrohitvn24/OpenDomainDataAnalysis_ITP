		<content> The only school in our area is the    
 Empingham C of E Primary which takes  
 children from 5 to 11 years old. The  
 present modern school was open by Lord
 Sandford in 1973, deputising for Mrs. 
 Margaret Thatcher.  This replaced the 
 former school given to the village    
 last century by the Ancasters.        
 Numbers on roll have dropped from 120 
 to 38  with only two teachers.        
 Children are taught in groups allowing
 each child to develop at their own    
 rate.  School meals are prepared on   
 the premises.                         
 At 11+ children are transferred to    
 Casterton Community College and at 16+
 to Rutland Sixth Form College.        
 A few children in the area go to      
 public schools at Oakham and Stamford.
 One classroom is used by a preschool  
 playgroup, privately run.
