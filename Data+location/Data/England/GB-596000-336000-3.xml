		<title>03FARMING.</title>
		<content>  The bulk of the land is used for{    
 arable farming, particularly growing{ 
 malting barley. It is a rich greensand
 loam and produces heavy crops.The     
 winter crop is sugar beet harvested   
 between September and November, and   
 driven by lorry to King's Lynn to be  
 processed. Some small fields grow     
 blackcurrants and strawberries as a   
 contract crop for freezer firms.      
  Most of the small farms have been    
 merged into the larger businesses and 
 where formerly thirty men might be    
 employed now there may only be three. 
 There are no cattle in the village and
 only occasionally sheep are found.    
 Most of the former farm labourers are 
 now employed in the nearby town of    
 Fakenham.
