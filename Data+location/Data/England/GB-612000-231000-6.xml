		<title>06    A Typical School Day</title>
		<content>    On a{school day}I get up at 8.00.  
 My alarm wakes me up and I get washed,
 clean my teeth and get dressed. I go  
 downstairs and I have cereals for     
 breakfast and a cup of tea. Then I go 
 outside and feed the fish with special
 fish food and I go to school for my   
{education.}                           
    We line up in the playground when  
 the bell goes. We come in at 9.15 and 
 we have assembly. We have break time  
 at 10.30 and we have 20 minutes to    
 play and to eat crisps then we come   
 in. We have quiet reading at 12.00 and
 we go in to dinner at 12.15. At 1.15  
 we come in and have afternoon lessons.
    At 3.15 I go home and I have some  
 sweets and watch the television or I  
 go out to play with my friends.       
    When my dad comes home from work I 
 go in for tea and go to bed at 9.00.
