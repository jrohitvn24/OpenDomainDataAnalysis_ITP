		<content>  The county of Buckinghamshire is in  
the south-east of England.The 12 square
kilometres we are covering are in the  
south-east corner of Buckinghamshire.  
Through Buckinghamshire runs a range of
hills called the Chilterns which have  
gentle slopes.This range of hills is   
divided by the Chess Valley.Through the
Chess Valley runs the River Chess,     
which flows into the Bury Pond and     
carries  on through Chesham.   Chesham 
is at the head of the five valleys.The 
height ranges from 105 to 175 metres.  
  There is woodland throughout         
the area and the north and west is     
mainly used for agricultural purposes. 
In the east there is the town of       
Chesham and Lowndes Park,with Scottowes
Pond.St.Mary's church is the oldest    
building in Chesham and sticks out on  
the skyline.Chartridge is a quiet      
village surrounded by countryside.     </content>
