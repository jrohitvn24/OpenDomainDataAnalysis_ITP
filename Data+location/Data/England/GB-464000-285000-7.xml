 There are 164 people on the electoral 
 role and a further 35 under the age of
 18, of whom 14 are under the age of 5.
 There are 39 couples between the ages 
 of l8 and 60 and 32 single people in  
 this age group. There are 19 couples  
 over the age of 60 and 18 single      
 people in this age group.  22 adults  
 were born in the village and still    
 live here including 2 who are over 80.
 Less than 12 people have lived here   
 for more than 40 years and less than  
 12 came here during the last year. So 
 it seems that the majority of people  
 living in the village now came here   
 since the end of the Second World War.
