 I start to walk to school at{20 past  
{8.}It's not far to walk but we have to
 get there at half past 8. I say bye to
 my mum and unlock the big wooden door 
 with a key. That door is quite heavy  
 because it's an old one.Well the whole
 house is{very}old.There was a house on
 the site 800 years ago. Anyway I scuff
 down the gravel and I walk past the   
 front of the house -{it's only a 3    
{minute walk!}When I get to school I   
 take my books inside. I have my own   
 drawer so I put them in it. Then we   
 go out to play till quarter to nine.  
 We play with small cars sometimes or  
 play running games. After we've  been 
 out one of the teachers clap their    
 hands and we all line up to go into   
 school.
