		<title>14A DAY IN THE LIFE OF.....</title>
		<content> JUNE 1985                             
 I got up at 7.30am. I had a shower,   
 got dressed and made my bed. I went   
 downstairs to have breakfast with my  
 sister and baby brother. At 8.45am my 
 Grandpa took me and my sister to      
 school in the car. The school bell    
 rang at 9am and my day at school      
 began. We all went into the big hall  
 for assembly. We joined in with a     
 radio programme to sing and listen to 
 a story. My first lesson was Maths. At
 10.40am there was break and then a    
 lesson of English before lunch. At 12 
 midday we all went into the dinner    
 hall and had a hot dinner prepared by 
 the school cooks. After dinner I went 
 out and practised for the district    
 sports day. The next lesson was       
 swimming in the school open air pool  
 then we had another break.
