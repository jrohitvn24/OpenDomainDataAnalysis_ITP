		<title>14Nazeing Glass Works</title>
		<content> We had a very interesting trip around 
 Nazeing Glass Works. Mr. Madsen took  
 us all around the factory and we saw  
 stemmed glasses, ash trays and signal 
 light covers being made.              
                                       
 Some of the men were moulding glass   
 and others were blowing glass. Glass  
 blowing is a technique that has stayed
 the same for hundreds of years. It is 
 very skilful. We watched the men      
 taking the lumps of molten glass and  
 blowing into it. They blew and twirled
 until they got the shape they wanted. 
                                       
 About 130 people are employed at the  
 works and most of them live in the    
 surrounding area. About 75 people are 
 employed making glass and the rest    
 work in the offices.
