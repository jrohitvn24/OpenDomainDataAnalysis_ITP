		<title>13SCARBOROUGH CREMATORIUM</title>
		<content>    Woodlands cemetery,Scarborough     
 opened in January 1941.There are      
 10,944 bodies buried there.Woodlands  
 crematorium opened twenty years later 
 in 1961.Nowadays the average number of
 people cremated is 68%.Between April  
 1984 and March 1985 there were 1,736  
 cremations.This works out at          
 approximately 32 cremations per       
 week.It takes about 1hour and 20      
 minutes for a cremation, but it       
 depends on the body size.When the     
 coffin is brought to the chapel it    
 is placed on a catafalque,the         
 curtains can be requested to be       
 drawn or left open by the             
 family.After the service the coffin   
 is lifted into the cremator.The       
 remains are put through a machine to  
 reduce the bones to ashes.Usually     
 the ashes are strewn in the garden    
 of remembrance.                       </content>
