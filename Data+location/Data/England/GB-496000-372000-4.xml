		<content> In 1908 the Ornamental Pond was well  
 laid out.  There was clear water for  
 the swans to swim in, and the pond was
 surrounded by young elm trees, rock   
 and pathways.  With a number of seats 
 for visitors to sit on while the      
 children played, and also were well   
 tended shrubberies.                   
 But now sadly the pond is overgrown   
 and untidy, and receives very little  
 attention.  There are rotting tree    
 stumps where huge elms once stood but 
 have now been felled due to the Dutch 
 Elm disease.  Some of the remaining   
 elms are good, specimens reaching to a
 height of sixty feet, but a few appear
 to be in trouble.  There is no trace  
 of the shrubberies today, nor the     
 pathways, and swans no longer use it. 
 Various branches, weeds and rubbish   
 have been thrown in the pond by       
 careless youths.       Janine Scott.  </content>
