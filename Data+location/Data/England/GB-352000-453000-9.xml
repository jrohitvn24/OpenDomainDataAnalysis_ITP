		<title>09OVER WYRESDALE: WOODLAND</title>
		<content>         The woodland here lies largely
 in the valleys  of the R.Wyre and its 
 tributary streams, though there are   
 some isolated stands. It is mixed     
 woodland - conifers and deciduous     
 trees, (mainly oak, sycamore and      
 beech). To the east 300 acres are     
 owned by the Grosvenor Estates. This  
 is well maintained, primarily for the 
 purpose of breeding and rearing game  
 birds (predominantly pheasants) rather
 than for commercial timber. The       
 pheasants are incubated from eggs in  
 large numbers and are released into   
 the woods at the age of 8 weeks. They 
 then grow to maturity in the wild.    
 Game poaching, mainly for pheasants,  
 is one of the main offences committed 
 in the area, another being that of    
 illegally disturbing and attempting to
 steal birds of prey - Schedule 1      
 specially protected birds.            </content>
