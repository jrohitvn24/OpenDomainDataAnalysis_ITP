		<title>03WINTER HILL TRANSMITTER</title>
		<content> From Winter Hill{television}programmes
 for BBC and ITV are transmitted. This 
 is an example of the{science and      
{technology}of our time. 19 people work
 at the{transmitter}. They work from   
 9.00.a.m. until 5.00.p.m. During the  
 winter months  access to the site is  
 often difficult because of heavy      
 snowfalls on this elevated and exposed
 site.                                 
                                       
 The{mast}, which is 1015 feet high,   
 has been standing since 1964. It was  
 built on Winter Hill because it is the
 highest point in the transmitting     
 area. On the site there are several   
 smaller masts which serve the police, 
 British Telecom and Norweb.           
                                       
 In 1958 there was a plane crash on    
 Winter Hill, resulting in the deaths  
 of 34 people.                         </content>
