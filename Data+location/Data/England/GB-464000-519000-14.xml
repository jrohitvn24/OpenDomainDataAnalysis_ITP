		<content> Mum woke me up at 8.00am. I got       
 dressed, had my breakfast of Corn     
 Flakes before leaving for school. I   
 called for my friend Stephen and we   
 walked there together. We arrived at  
 school about 8.55am. and entered at   
 9.00am. After registration we had a   
 radio assembly that finished at       
 9.30am. Then we had maths till first  
 playtime at 10.30am. I played soccer. 
 When we came in we started on the     
 Domesday Project which you are reading
 now. While doing that we played       
 "Flowers of Crystal" on the computer. 
 At 12.00pm we had lunch and playtime. 
 I eat a packed meal made at home.     
 After lunch I played Bulldog. Later we
 watched Animals in Action which was   
 about running. At 2.30pm we had       
 playtime until 2.45pm. Then we had a  
 reading session and at 3.30pm we went 
 home.(My name is Tim Thacker.)        </content>
