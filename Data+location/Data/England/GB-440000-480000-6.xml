		<content>{Shopping Counts:}We recorded numbers  
 of people going through entrances of  
 two supermarkets, during l5 minutes,  
 on a weekday.                         
 Shop A: 6O women, 2O men, 7 children. 
 Shop B: 2O women, 9 men, 3 children.  
 We thought we would find a lot more   
 women than men doing shopping on a    
 weekday, but we were surprised that   
 there were not more children with     
 them.                                 
{Carpark Counts:}There is plenty of    
 space for parking and it is free. The 
 market square is used and there are 2 
 parks in Millgate.{Market Square:}2lO 
 cars, 3 lorries, 3 buses, l bicycle   
{Millgate:}66 cars, 2 lorries          
 Our results show that people like to  
 park as near to the centre as possible
{Use of buildings:}Most buildings in   
 the centre are to do with trade.      
 Although we did not manage to count   </content>
