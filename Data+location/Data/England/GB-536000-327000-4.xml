		<content> Thompsons have farmed at Grove Farm   
 for over 200 yrs.The present owner is 
 Michael Thompson.Until about 1950 the 
 main crop was potatoes. then they     
 suffered badly as the land became poor
 and disease widespread.So sheep were  
 introduced to put goodness back into  
 the soil naturally.In 1965 a dairy    
 herd of Friesans was introduced. This 
 is based in Norfolk but the cows come 
 to Grove Farm to be inseminated.There 
 are now 200 dairy cows plus followers 
 on,and about 5000 sheep.The sheep are 
 a cross between a Wensleydale ewe and 
 a Blue Leicester ram,known as         
 "mules".They sell the wool-3kg.per    
 sheep-and the lambs for meat.The sheep
 are dipped twice yearly and cannot be 
 killed for 2 wks.The vegetables are   
 grown on a 9 yr.rotation.This is      
 it-peas,carrots,potatoes,beet,wheat,wh
 eat,onions then 2 yrs.of animals.     </content>
