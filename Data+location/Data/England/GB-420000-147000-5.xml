		<title>05POPULATION IN TIDWORTH</title>
		<content>  The population of Tidworth is approx-
 imately 12000. Roughly 10000 of these 
 are military personnel and their      
 families. As the area is a major Army 
 garrison the population level remains 
 fairly constant. However within a     
 period of five years the majority of  
 the military personnel will move away 
 to be replaced by an equal number of  
 new units or individuals. There are in
 the region of 1500 children upto the  
 age of 11 years. The civilian         
 population remains fairly static and  
 tends to be more middle aged. A small 
 proportion are native to the village  
 but the majority have settled in      
 Tidworth after leaving the Armed      
 Forces.
