		<content>{ Battyeford}is a small part of the    
 area of{Mirfield(POP:1981 18,687).}Now
 it is really a{dormitory town}serving 
 a much larger area.The proximity of   
 the{M1 &amp; M62}enable many people to    
 travel to work daily in such towns as 
{Leeds,Manchester,Sheffield}and with   
 the{"Yorkshire Pullman"}train{London. 
  The area is mainly modern estates    
 with some older properties down by    
 the{Calder}near{Half-penny Bridge,}and
 up at{Clifton,}although there are     
 some very fine big houses which once  
 belonged to the mill owners.          
  Industry has declined,although there 
 are still textile firms along the     
 floor of the valley,some of the mills 
 have been converted to a variety of   
 light industries.One is now a{Pig Farm
 PATTERSONS much to the annoyance of   
 most of the population,especially on  
 warm,breezy days,{IN FACT MOST DAYS.  </content>
