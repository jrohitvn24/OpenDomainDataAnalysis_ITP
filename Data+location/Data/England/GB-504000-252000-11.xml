 most families did a big weekly shop in
 the town supermarkets and only bought 
 small amounts locally.                
    The pattern of family meals varied 
 considerably except that nearly every 
 child (5-9yr) had lunch at school. The
 family meals at home varied from the  
 whole family having an evening meal at
 approximately 6.30 p.m. to each person
 having a snack or meal as they arrived
 back in the evening.                  
    The number of family members       
 preferring traditional English        
 fare, convenience foods or foreign    
 dishes were nearly the same and most  
 families preferred a mixture of all   
 types of cooking.                     
    Family holidays also varied in type
 and their frequency was:-
