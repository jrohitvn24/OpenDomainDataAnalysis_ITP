		<content> Medical Services, Surgeries both      
 medical &amp; dental  are available in    
 several places all are situated up to 
 5 miles away from most houses.  There 
 is a choice of several General        
 Practitioners with modern facilities. 
 People may need to travel 20 miles or 
 more to visit hospitals and may go to 
 one in any of the several surrounding 
 Towns though there is a Cottage       
 Hospital within 6 miles. A casualty   
 service is available here except at   
 night.
