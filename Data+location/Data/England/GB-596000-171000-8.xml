		<title>08Horse Riding at Eastchurch</title>
		<content>   Riding is a very popular{recreation 
 on Sheppey because there is not much  
 for young people to do, particularly  
 on Saturdays and Sundays.             
   One girl has two ponies of her own  
 and they provide her with a great deal
 of enjoyment. She is luckier than some
 children as she lives by a big field  
 called the Glen with swings, a slide  
 and a seesaw to play on.              
   She says riding also gives her a    
 chance to see the countryside and wild
 animals and birds.                    
   There are two riding{schools}in     
 Minster which anyone can go to either 
 taking your own{pony}or riding one of 
 theirs.                               
   She says that she enjoys{horse      
{riding}because she sees more of the   
 island and its life.
