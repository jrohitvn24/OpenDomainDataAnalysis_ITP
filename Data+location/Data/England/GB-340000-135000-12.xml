		<title>12Ashcott - Past (continued)</title>
		<content> The only reason to have a new school  
 is the large number of children       
 arriving from nearby villages where   
{schools}are closing rapidly.The 1st   
 council houses were built 80 years    
 ago.There has been a lot of building  
{development}during the last decade.   
 Yet the old buildings remain and the  
 new homes are well designed.          
{World War II:}The main disturbance in 
 Ashcott was all the men having to     
 fight.The area received very large    
 numbers of{evacuees,}mostly from the  
 cities.These evacuees found rural life
 very strange,one did not know what an 
 egg was.One woman is still contacting 
 her evacuees who live in Canada.A 500 
 lb bomb fell but sank into the soft   
 ground.It has never been recovered.   
 There was a fire control and spotlight
 unit in Ashcott.
