		<content> Area 0428 0357 surveyed and recorded  
 by the children and staff of Holy     
 Trinty School, Clifton Road, Matlock  
 Bath, Derbyshire, helped by numerous  
 parents.                              
 Work carried out in June and July     
 1985.                                 
 The work involved walking to each part
 of the area in very hot weather and   
 each journey involved steep uphill    
 climbs.                               
 The children benefitted most, I feel, 
 from the various interviews they      
 carried out.
