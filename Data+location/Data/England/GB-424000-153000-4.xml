 The Marquess of Ailesbury supplied the
 money for the school to be built in   
 1862.When the school originally opened
 it was built for 110 pupils,though not
 that many attended.The first          
 headmaster had to leave in 1869       
 because he didn't play the organ on   
 Sundays.The children left school      
 permanently at the age of 12.Some     
 children left temporarily to help on  
 the farm or at home.Some of the older 
 children stayed after school to learn 
 the lessons for the next day,so that  
 they could help teach.They were called
 pupil teachers.The children started   
 school at the age of 5 years old.When 
 the school opened there was only one  
 teacher.
