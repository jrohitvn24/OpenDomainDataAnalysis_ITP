		<content> Finally,we thought it would be helpful
 to try and sum up what we think about 
 our village and the surrounding       
 countryside.As you can see it is      
 growing at the moment and may become  
 a bit too big for some people in the  
 next few years. The people who live   
 here do a variety of jobs from        
 engineering in precision hydraulics to
 electronics,from banking and insurance
 and chemical research at the nearby   
 Coal Board establishment to a wide    
 range of work for the Government      
 Communications Headquarters a few     
 miles away.                           
      The community would seem to be   
 reasonably prosperous and content     
 having time to show its humour:- there
 is a notice outside one large house   
 stating"Blind dog and deaf cat--      
 please drive carefully."              
                                       </content>
