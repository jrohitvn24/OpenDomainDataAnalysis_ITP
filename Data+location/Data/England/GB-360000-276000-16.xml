		<content> In the morning I have cereal, egg and 
 toast for breakfast. In the bathroom  
 I clean my teeth with a tooth brush   
 and paste. We wait in the bus         
 shelter for the school bus. When we   
 reach school we get out our books and 
 prepare for assembly .After           
 assembly we do morning work, which    
 usually is maths and writing until    
 dinner time when we have school       
 dinners which are brought from        
 Cleobury. In the afternoon we do some 
 good work and at a quarter past three 
 we go home. We have tea which has been
 prepared on an electric cooker. I     
 watch a bit of television. Then I go  
 to bed not before saying my prayers   
 then I settle down under my duvet and 
 that's the end of my day.             
                                       
                                       
                                      .</content>
