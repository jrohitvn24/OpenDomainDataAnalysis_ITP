		<title>16Public Services in Beckermet</title>
		<content>  There is an infrequent public        
transport service through the village  
provided by Cumberland Motor Services. 
The number of buses routed through the 
village has diminished in the last few 
years as a result of a decreasing      
number of passengers related to rising 
fares.                                 
  The Railway Station in the village   
closed in 1964 but there is a request  
stop station at Braystones which is on 
the Carlisle to Barrow line.           
  The County Council provide a Refuse  
Collection Service to the area once a  
week and also a Road Cleaner.          
  The local policeman lives 3 miles    
from Beckermet but he is a frequent and
respected visitor to the area. Crime is
generally in the form of burglaries or 
motoring offences.Drug related offences
are increasing. He drives a Panda car. 
He teaches the children Cycling.       </content>
