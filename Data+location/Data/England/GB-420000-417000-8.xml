 On a school day I get up at 8-00am.At 
 8-15am I have my breakfast of cereal  
 and milk. At 8-25am I go to school.   
 When I arrive I go straight inside. We
 start lessons at 9-00am. On a Monday  
 we have music followed by topic work. 
 At 10-15am we have prayers and then it
 is playtime.We have maths until noon. 
 I have sandwiches,but could have a    
 lunch.In the afternoon we have a      
 spelling and tables test and then do  
 our reference work. After the break we
 have games.At 3-30pm I go home.For tea
 I have meat and chips. I get ready for
 Brownies. At 6-00pm I set off. There  
 is a "Bring and Buy Sale" tonight at  
 7-00pm. At 8-00pm I go home. When I   
 reach home I have a bath and get      
 changed ready for bed. I have my      
 supper and then go upstairs to bed.
