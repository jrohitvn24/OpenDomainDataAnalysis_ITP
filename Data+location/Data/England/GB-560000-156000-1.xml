		<title>01SUMMARY OF OUR AREA</title>
		<content>Our study area lies within the Vale of 
Holmesdale, a broad,wide clay valley   
which runs east to west through Kent.  
To the north and south are parallel    
ridges of more resistant rock. The     
North Downs have their scarp slope to  
the north while the dip slope of the   
Ragstone Ridge is to the south.        
   On a clay soil it is suprising to   
find such a variety of farming with    
orchards and fruit being grown         
together with cereals as well as       
pasture.                               
   One of the characteristics of our   
area is the way the lines of           
communication run east-west along the  
vale. These include the M20,M26 and A25
and the railway.                       
   The main settlements are Borough    
Green, St.Mary's Platt and Wrotham     
Heath. Borough Green is the largest but
it only really a large village.        </content>
