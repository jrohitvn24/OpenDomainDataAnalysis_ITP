		<content> We asked a number of people how they  
 spent their{leisure}time. The most    
 popular{leisure}time activity was     
 going out places. In second place was 
 going to pubs. In third was           
 gardening. Fourth was swimming. Fifth 
 was knitting. In sixth place was      
 fishing, biking, playing computers,   
 playing games, going to the library   
 and reading. Also there was one person
 who played golf, went birdwatching or 
 shooting. We did about 60 interviews  
 23 people answered, 37 refused. Some  
 people spent money on what they did,  
 others did not. Some people had lots  
 of things to do, others just the one.
