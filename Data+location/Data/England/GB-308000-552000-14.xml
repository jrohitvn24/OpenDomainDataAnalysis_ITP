		<title>14Religion - Silloth</title>
		<content> There are five churches in Silloth,and
 one in West Silloth, the {Pentecostal,
 whose building used to belong  to  the
 Church of England. In 1870, the Church
 of England built {Christ Church,}half-
 way along Criffel St., overlooking the
 Green. The Vicar is  Rev. P. Tompkins.
 About 70 attend Sunday morning service
 and  about 20 in the afternoon, unless
 there is a special service. The number
 increases in summer with the influence
 of tourists. ( This applies to all the
 churches.)  It is built in a Victorian
 "Gothic"  style of sandstone,  granite
 and brick. Recently a lot of money had
 to be raised for  repairs to the bell-
 tower and walls. {St. Andrew's }is the
{Presbyterian }church built in 1886, of
 brick, in Solway St. Mr. Warren is the
 minister,  and the  church elders help
 him to run it.  About 30 people attend
 the service at 10.30 each week.{Cont'd</content>
