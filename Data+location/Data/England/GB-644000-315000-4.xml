 the Broads.The Broads are on each side
 of the A149.On the Northen side of the
 road you can rent a rowing boat and go
 fishing on Ormesby Broad.On the       
 southern side there is a yacht        
 club.Rollesby Broad is also very      
 beautiful and has some ducks living   
 there.One Broad also bigger than the  
 other.You can fish from a good spot by
 the Broad.There is also a large area  
 of deciduous and coniferous trees     
 surrounding the Broad.                
 The farmland in Rollesby is mostly    
 covered with Peas and Barley.         
 The Water company is hidden behind    
 some trees facing the road.There is a 
 road going up to the water but you    
 can't go up there because it is       
 private.
