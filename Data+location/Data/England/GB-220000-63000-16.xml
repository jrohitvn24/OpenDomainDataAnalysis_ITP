		<content>   THE ROLE OF THE FATHER HAS ALSO     
 CHANGED. IT IS STILL QUITE RARE TO SEE
 A MAN PUSH A PUSHCHAIR BUT IS GETTING 
 MORE COMMON. MORE MEN ARE PRESENT AT  
 THE BIRTH OF THEIR OFFSPRING, ALTHOUGH
 THERE ARE NO ANTE-NATAL CLASSES FOR   
 MEN.                                  
    THE ROLE OF WOMEN IS ALSO CHANGING 
 AND WIDENING. MORE WOMEN ARE WORKING  
 IN PAID EMPLOYMENT OR ARE TAKING A    
 PART IN THE BUISNESS SIDE OF THEIR    
 FARMS. THERE IS EVEN TALK OF DAUGHTERS
 INHERITING A FARM. WOMEN AND MEN STILL
 TEND TO HAVE SEPERATE INTERESTS. IN   
 THE CHAPELS FOR EXAMPLE, RAISING MONEY
 FOR OVERSEAS MISSIONS IS THE WORK OF  
 THE WOMENS FELLOWSHIP. SOME STILL FEEL
 UNCOMFORTABLE WITH WOMEN TAKING OFFICE
 IN THE CHURCH. THE FIRST WOMAN        
 MINISTER HAS JUST BEEN APPOINTED TO   
 THE CIRCUIT.                          
                                       </content>
