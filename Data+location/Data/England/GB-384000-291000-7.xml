		<title>07Fire Station Fireworks</title>
		<content> In early November, close to Guy Fawkes
Night on the  5th, the  firemen at  the
fire station in Wombourne arrange a big
bonfire and fireworks display.  We used
to have our own bonfire  at the side of
our house but my dad  won't let us have
it anymore.  Last year some sparks went
into his  garden shed and  a lot  of it
was burned. The fire engine had to come
and the firemen  put it  out with water
from their hoses.                      
 We  will go  to see  the fireworks and
the bonfire  at  the fire station  this
year. They have whistling rockets,roman
candles,  catherine  wheels,  fountains
and  lots of  other noisy and colourful
ones. The spectators are not allowed to
go too near the bonfire.               
 It is much safer than ours was but I  
can't throw anything on the fire now!
