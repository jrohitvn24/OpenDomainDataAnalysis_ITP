		<title>17THE DAY OF A SCHOOLCHILD.</title>
		<content> Pupils at Chilton Cantelo School have 
 a hard life compared with our own     
 school.The day begins at 7.15 a.m.    
 when a bell wakes everyone. The first 
 task is to tidy their rooms ready for 
 inspection. At 7.40 a.m. they have a  
 roll call followed by breakfast.      
 The morning lessons last until 1.00   
 p.m. with only a half an hour break.  
 After lunch they work until 5.00 p.m. 
 and then they have tea. Homework is   
 done for about one and a half hours.  
 They are then free until lights out at
 8.30 for juniors and for seniors at   
 10.30. Lessons are also given on      
 Saturday mornings. For the rest of the
 weekend they can follow their own     
 interests.Their lessons include such  
 subjects as Maths, English, French,   
 Science,Art and all sorts of sports.  
 They wear green or blue jumpers with  
 black or grey trousers or skirts.     </content>
