		<title>02VILLAGE TWINNING</title>
		<content>     Wingrave is different from many   
other villages because it is twinned   
with a village in France called La     
Bouexiere.  This twinning started with 
a visit to France in 1984, since then  
many other events have been held both  
there and in Wingrave.                 
     The offical twinning of Wingrave  
and La Bouexiere was held in Wingrave  
on the 26th May 1985 at 19.30.  For    
this occasion a tree was planted with a
plaque below it and signs saying       
"Twinned with La Bouexiere" were added 
to the bottom of Wingrave signs.       
     The purpose of the twinning was   
that children and adults from different
countries can meet up and stay with    
each other and discover what it is     
like in a foreign country.
