		<title>05MY FAVOURITE KEELBY PLACES</title>
		<content> My name is Emma Gresswell I am 10     
 years old. My favourite places in     
 Keelby are Trolls Bridge and the Dead 
 End. I like Trolls Bridge because when
 the fields surrounding it are nice and
 golden with corn you can go on        
 picnics. There is quite a small stream
 running under Trolls Bridge but it is 
 enjoyable to watch . My brother and I 
 sometimes go fishing with a fishing   
 net but we don't catch much. We did go
 down there once though and I managed  
 to catch an extremeley big toad . We  
 also got some water insects . The     
 stream has got lots of vegetation     
 growing in it but people like putting 
 litter in it . It is fairly deep and  
 if you walk in it you get stuck in the
 mud.The Dead End is also an enjoyable 
 place to be because you can have      
 secret dens down there .My friends and
 I often play action packed games there</content>
