		<content>At playtime we always play many games  
but we always play {football}.We have  
the top class versus everybody else.   
People who do not like football play   
{Chainy}.One person is "on" and if they
catch someone else they hold hands and 
they run and try and catch other people
to make the chain longer.When everyone 
is in the chain we start again.        
Sometimes we play {Bulldog}.You have to
across the playground without getting  
caught by the other side.If you get    
caught and you can't get away within   
ten seconds you are on with the other  
side.                                  
Girls usually join in the same games as
the boys though they also play {Skittle
Ball}.Some girls play football.
