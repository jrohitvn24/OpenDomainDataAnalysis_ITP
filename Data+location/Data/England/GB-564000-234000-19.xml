		<title>19EMPLOYMENT IN THE SAMPFORDS</title>
		<content> In the Sampfords,from our survey the  
 people are employed in many different 
 kinds of work.One of the most popular 
 types of work is farming.Some people  
 are farmers while others do other     
 farming jobs.Teaching is another      
 popular type of work with the Sampford
 people.Salesmen and engineers come    
 high on the list of employees.We      
 noticed that we also have a cook and a
 chef in the village.In most families  
 only one person works.From the        
 survey,it was noticeable that many    
 people who live in the Sampfords have 
 to travel to go to their work.The     
 farmers were the people who lived     
 within 5 miles of their work.Teachers 
 often travel between 10+20 miles to   
 reach their schools.Other people      
 travelled even further.However there  
 are several who work at home.
