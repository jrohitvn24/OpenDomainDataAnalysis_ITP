"We went on a school trip to the       
Nature Reserve  on the 18th June.      
The man who made  it  told  us         
everything about nature.               
The girls found about 10 different     
sorts of grass and wild flowers like   
"eggs and bacon". These were all       
common plants   - he had some rare     
flowers too, like   spotted orchids,   
but we couldn't pick those.            
The man who owned it saw a heron       
standing in one of the ponds looking   
for fish to eat but the  heron flew    
away. He saw another heron in the      
winter-time standing on the ice looking
for food. It was very thin but it      
didn't fly away - it was too weak.     
Then we   went near the railway line   
and we saw some baby rabbits playing   
in the field. Before we went home we   
each had an Aylesbury duck egg."       </content>
