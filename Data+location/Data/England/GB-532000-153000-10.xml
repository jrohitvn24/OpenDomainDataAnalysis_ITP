   St. Lawrences church was built in   
 1095. It is made of flint, Godstone   
 stone, bricks and tiles. There was a  
 wooden church there in{SAXON TIMES.}In
 1230 the north aisle was added. It has
 two bells made in 1664 by John Hodson.
 There is one Norman Window. There is  
 said to be a plague pit in the        
 churchyard.                           
   More people came to live in Caterham
 when the railway was built in 1856.   
 St. Lawrences church was too small and
 so a new church was built.            
{                                      
{ST. MARY'S CHURCH}                    
   St. Mary's Church was built in 1866 
 opposite St. Lawrences Church. In 1883
 the spire was built and so was the    
 south aisle.
