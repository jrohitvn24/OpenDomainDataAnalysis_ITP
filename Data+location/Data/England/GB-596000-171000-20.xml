		<title>20Cliff Erosion - Eastchurch</title>
		<content>   The{cliffs}along the north coast of 
 Sheppey are constantly being eroded.  
 The Royal Oak Public House went over  
 the cliffs in the late 1960s.         
   After this it was decided to try and
 make the cliffs safe so in part they  
 were{landscaped}and huge stones were  
 put at the bottom and pebble{drainage 
 channels were laid. However this cost 
 a great deal of money so the council  
 will probably concentrate on the      
 highly populated areas.               
   The reason for the cliff{erosion}is 
 the rain and wind which beats against 
 them and the vast number of           
 underground streams. The cliffs are of
 clay which soaks up the water in      
 winter but this means that in summer  
 they crack and fall down as they dry  
 out.
