 A DAY IN THE LIFE OF A HOUSEWIFE      
 A typical day in Mrs Dillons life is  
 getting up at 7.00am. She gets        
 every_body ready for school then      
 gets the childrens breakfast ready and
 washes up and tidies up by 8.15am.    
 Then she gets the bike out of the     
 garage walks down to school drops all 
 the children off at school. Then she  
 cycles up to the university she works 
 in the library until 12.15pm and goes 
 home for a quick coffee and cycles    
 back to school to see if Gerard goes  
 back into class. Then she goes        
 shopping or visiting she might watch a
 bit of tennis and goes to collect     
 Gerard from school.Then she gets the  
 tea ready. If anyone wants dropping   
 off any where like Brownies or tennis 
 she takes them in the car.She might go
 to a meeting,or watch T.V.if lucky.   </content>
