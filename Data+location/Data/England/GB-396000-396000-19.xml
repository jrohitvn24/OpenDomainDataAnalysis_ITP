		<content> Stalyhill.- Housing. Old Houses in the
 area were called 'folds', and were    
 built as farms in the form of a square
 to protect animals. Luke's fold and   
 Tong's fold are now very expensive,   
 converted houses. Nailor's, Higher and
 Lower Arpley are still working farms. 
 Nailors has been farmed by the        
 Thompson family for almost 100 years. 
 The Farm is dated 1738, but the back  
 of the house is very old, and has     
 beams from ships.                     
 Mamy of the modern houses have two    
 bathrooms and nearly all are two car  
 families. The houses are brick built. 
 Many are detached, but there are also 
 semis, and town houses, and bungalows.
