 As in every village, Winestead has its
 "characters", two of whom are brothers
 in their 60th year, living in a       
 cottage which in 1985 does not have   
 electricity, water, sewerage, no      
 modern amenities and they wash at a   
 pump out in the yard.  They both do   
 their own cooking etc. and do not     
 speak to each other.                  
 Although living in such conditions,   
 they each always buy new cars, one    
 having a Reliant three wheeler car and
 the other having a large car,         
 currently being a Vauxhall (part of   
 General Motors, America )
