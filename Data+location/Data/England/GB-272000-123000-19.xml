		<content>{ ROSE ASH GYMKANA AND REVEL-By MATTHEW
    I woke up at about 8:30 the gymkana
 started about 1:00 but I went up about
 10:00. I helped set up most ofthe     
 stalls. First of all I helped set all 
 the stuff. I will write the sequence: 
     {10.00 set up all the stuff       
      {1.00 horse racing started       
      {5.30 clay pigeon shoot          
      {8.30 barbecue and disco         
    I have been going to the gymkana   
 for about 5 years now . The first one 
 was only a get-together. This year it 
 was a big thing, over two hundred     
 people came.                          
    When I got there they got me       
 working straight away. I brought cream
 cakes from people's cars.I took them  
 in the main tent which was at the top 
 of the field.The cars and pedestrians 
 were in one field and the horses were 
 in another field.                     </content>
