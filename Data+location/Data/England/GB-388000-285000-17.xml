		<title>17FAMILY LIFE, WORDSLEY 1980'S</title>
		<content>   {Life in Wordsley}is typical of many
 other areas in the{West Midlands.     
 Nuclear families live in semi-detached
 and detached homes, most of them      
 privately owned. In many instances,the
 extended family also lives in the     
 district. Most families care for their
 homes and gardens and are frequently  
 seen painting and decorating,         
 gardening or cleaning the family car. 
    There are very few homes without at
 least one television, usually colour, 
 and sometimes the children may have a 
 second television in their bedrooms.It
 is not uncommon to find such items as 
 video recorders,hi-fi systems and home
 computers in many homes, as well as   
 the usual time-saving devices such as 
 vacuum cleaners and automatic washing 
 machines. Children are frequently seen
 riding their bicycles, roller skating 
 and skateboarding.                    </content>
