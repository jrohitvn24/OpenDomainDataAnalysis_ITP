		<content>{DRAYTON PARSLOW.}HERE THIRTY FIVE     
 PEOPLE WERE INTERVIEWED.FOURTEEN      
 PEOPLE HAVED LIVED HERE FOR LESS THAN 
 FIVE YEARS AND SEVEN HAVE LIVED FOR   
 LESS THAN ONE YEAR.ONLY FIVE PEOPLE   
 LIVED HERE ALL THEIR LIVES.DOGS WERE  
 AGAIN THE HIGHEST(SIXTEEN),CATS       
 (FOURTEEN),FISH WERE QUITE HIGH(FIVE).
 AGAIN THERE IS NO GAS SO FOOD IS      
 COOKED BY ELECTRICITY.MOST PEOPLE USED
 THE VILLAGE SHOPS.                    
 IN BOTH VILLAGES CARS WERE OWNDED BY  
 THE MAJORITY OF HOUSEHOLDS.TWO OR     
 THREE BEING QUITE COMMON.THIS IS      
 PROBABLY DUE TO THE POOR BUS SERVICE  
 AND THE NEAREST TRAIN STATIONS BEING  
 MILTON KEYNES AND BLETCHLEY.          
 ALL HOUSES ARE CONNECTED TO MAINS     
 WATER AND EXCEPT FOR SOME OUTLYING    
 FARMS MAINS SEWERAGE.
