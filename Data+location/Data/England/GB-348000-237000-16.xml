		<content>   Hereford is a very nice place. There
 is a lot to do and there are plenty of
 sports shops where you can buy gear.  
 There is a park called{Bishop's Meadow
 and we have the{King George V Playing 
{Fields.}At the back of the fields     
 there's a Bandstand where Breakdancers
 go sometimes.{Breakdancing}is a kind  
 of dance which was invented in America
 to stop fighting.                     
   I like{jogging}and I go{swimming.}My
 friend goes to{Kung Fu,}a martial art,
 and{Karate.}There are some{Discos,    
 like the Vortex, where you can dance  
 and listen to pop music. We even have 
 a{Snooker Centre.                     
   My friend Daniel is a{Scout.}There  
 are 12 troops in the city for boys    
 from 11 to 16 years. Dan goes on      
 Thursdays from 7.30 p.m. to 9 p.m. and
