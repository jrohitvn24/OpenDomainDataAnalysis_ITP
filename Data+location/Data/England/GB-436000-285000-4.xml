		<content> Industry in this area consists of     
 small industrial units.Most are       
 situated on a large industrial estate 
 at Bayton road,they make items that   
 include nuts and bolts,metal          
 mouldings,plumbing and heating        
 equipment and chromed items.As well as
 two small engineering firms and a     
 chemical cleaning plant,there is a    
 quite large petrol storage depot.Away 
 from the industrial estate,situated in
 the middle of a housing estate are    
 more small units.One specialises in   
 customising cars.There they produce   
 about 24cars a year and it takes about
 200men hours to build a new car.The   
 cars range in cost from               
 Â£16:000_Â£30:000 each.The only colours 
 used for spraying the cars are        
 red,black,white and silver.Twenty     
 staff are employed there who on       
 average work 39 hours a week.         </content>
