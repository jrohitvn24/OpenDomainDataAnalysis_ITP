		<title>10Trees</title>
		<content>   In 1965 according to the records of 
 Much Hadham's Women's Institute, there
 were probably more elm trees than any 
 other tree in Much Hadham. The elms   
 were found in large numbers round the 
 Playing Fields, at The Hill and       
 Spindle Bridge.Then disaster struck in
 the late 1970's in the form of a      
 little beetle and the Dutch Elm       
 disease struck Britain. In a very     
 short space of time all the elms      
 disappeared from our countryside.David
 Bellamy, a famous conservationist,    
 organised a scheme to replace our lost
 elm trees with disease resistant      
 trees. Our school has purchased two of
 these trees for about Â£5.             
   Although the elms have gone there is
 still The Lordship's Ash,which        
 perpetuates the weather forecast for  
 summer "ash before oak a regular soak,
 oak before ash,just a little splash". </content>
