		<title>09Housing in rural Sowerby</title>
		<content>    Housing in this block is all       
 related to agriculture, with most of  
 the farm houses being occupied by     
 farmers. One farm house, however, is  
 unoccupied, and has been for some 5   
 years, as the farm is managed as part 
 of a large estate, and presumably no  
 farm worker requires housing. Another 
 farm house has been turned into flats 
 for similar reasons and the flats are 
 occupied by farm workers.             
    The large poultry units have their 
 own "tied" accommodation, attractive  
 modern bungalows right on the job.
