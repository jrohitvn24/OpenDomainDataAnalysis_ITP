 area for tourists and our area is     
 surrounded by centres such as         
 Castleton and Buxton where there are  
 both  long and short stay visitors.   
  In this area the main holiday        
 activity is{hiking.}One very well used
 route brings walkers in from Castleton
 and then down the dales to Miller's   
 Dale. There are Youth Hostels at both 
 these places. Other activities nearby

 history and general sightseeing.      
  Traffic of many nationalities passes 
 along the main A 623.{Accomodation}is 
 to be found in the Devonshire Arms, in
 several houses offering Bed and       
 Breakfast and in a number of rented   
 cottages used for holidays. There are
