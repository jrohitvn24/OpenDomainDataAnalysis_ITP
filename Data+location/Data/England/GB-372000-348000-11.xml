		<content>  Pam Jones is the main script-writer  
for the BATS (Betley Amateur Theatrical
Society).She has been in the BATS for  
14 years.There are approx.30 members   
and they do 2 or 3 shows a year which  
are performed mostly in Betley village 
hall but they sometimes perform in     
Balterly and Whitmore.The largest      
audience was for Â£Scrooge' which was   
performed at Betley Village Hall and   
written by Pam herself.Some of the     
other plays  that the BATS perform are 
produced by Judy Hudson, Bill Andrews  
and Phillip Bailey.The lighting is     
controlled by Adrian Bailey and Ron    
Jones in charge of the props.There is  
also Sara Martin who does the make-up  
and Sue Bailey who does the hair.Also  
Jean Maybe who makes the costumes.     
There was no other society before the  
BATS.
