		<title>02CHADWELL ST. MARY</title>
		<content>{  Chadwell}is a town just up the hill 
 north of Tilbury.                     
   It has a bit of everything.It has  a
 wood,two chapels,and a church,two     
 schools, and a library.               
   The origin of the town's name is a  
 very strange sort of story:           
   A man by the name of Chad built a   
 water well.Gradually a town grew up   
 around this well,and the town         
 inherited the name of "Chad's well".  
 The site of the well can be seen      
 at the foot of the hill to this       
 day.Chad was later called "St.        
 Chad";perhaps he baptised converts    
 in this well.                         
   The "St. Mary" was added            
 because that is the name of the parish
 church,which is an attractive,        
 flint-faced building with a Norman    
 tower.It stands at the crest of the   
 hill, next to the crossroads.         </content>
