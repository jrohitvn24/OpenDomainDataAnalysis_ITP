		<title>10BROUGH CASTLE</title>
		<content> THE CASTLE WAS BUILT BY THE NORMANS   
 AND IT IS 900 YEARS OLD. THE KEEP HAD 
 A PITCHED ROOF. THE TOP WAS A         
 SLEEPING ROOM AND THERE USED TO BE    
 A DUNGEON BUT NOW IT HAS BEEN TURNED  
 IN TO A PLACE LIKE A MUSEUM.          
                                       
 THIS CASTLE WAS BUILT IN A CORNER OF  
 THE ROMAN FORT AND 600 MEN LIVED      
 THERE.THE MIDDLE PART WAS A COURT     
 YARD. A LONG TIME AGO THERE USED TO BE
 STABLES. WHEN YOU GO UP THE CASTLE    
 STEPS YOU WILL FIND THEM VERY STEEP   
 AND WHEN IT RAINS IT WILL BECOME VERY 
 SLIPPY.                               
                                       
 WE SAW THE KITCHEN AND WE THINK WE SAW
 THE REMAINS OF THE OVEN. WE WENT INTO 
 THE DUNGEON AND WE SAW A ROMAN        
 SOLDIERS HEAD WHICH HAD BEEN CARVED ON
 A STONE.WE SAW SOME ROMAN SOLDIERS    
 BONES.                                </content>
