		<title>14300 Acre Farm, Prickwillow</title>
		<content>{Mr Stanley Rice}runs the farm which is
 on the North side of Prickwillow along
 its whole length up to the River.     
 'My family have had this farm since my
 Grandfather was alive. We are a{Peat  
{Farm} and it varies in depth from     
 18 inches to 4 feet. We suffer from { 
{Fen Blows}so we have to put down long 
 straw between Crops such as Onions to 
 prevent loss of soil and crops. Due to
 the Peat and the shell layer, brought 
 in by the Sea once, we need to add {  
{Manganese.                            
 As the Peat is used and dried out the{
{land drops at about an inch a year.}We
 are lucky, we have Marine Clay        
 underneath the Peat which is quite    
 fertile.                              
 For 1985 we are growing 50 acres of   
 potatoes, 60 of Sugar Beet, 40 of     
 Onions, 20 of Peas, 10 of Barley and  
 115 acres is Wheat.                   </content>
