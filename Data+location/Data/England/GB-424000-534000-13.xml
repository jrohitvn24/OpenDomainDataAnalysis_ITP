		<content>   As a child Mrs Andrews saw some     
 unusual sights at Croxdale, like the  
 Northern Lights and the air-ship R101.
 Once there was a total eclipse of the 
 sun. It was a dull, cloudy day and    
 everything went black.                
   In Croxdale there was no electricity
 so they used gas lamps. Mr Stark lit  
 the gas lights every evening. He also 
 'knocked-up' the miners to go to work 
 for their shift. On a slate next to   
 their front doors they would write the
 time at which they wanted him to      
 knock on their bedroom windows with a 
 pole.                                 
   Mrs Andrews went to Croxdale School.
 She liked it and worked hard to win a 
 scholarship to become a pupil-teacher 
 at the school. When she was older she 
 went to college and became fully      
 qualified. She taught in the area     
 until she retired.                    </content>
