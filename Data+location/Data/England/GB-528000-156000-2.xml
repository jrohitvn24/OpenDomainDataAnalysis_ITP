		<content>  Although the area is well catered for
one or two improvements could be made. 
For example, the kerb from Taunton     
Manor School along the common could be 
raised to stop people parking on the   
grass and making it too muddy for      
others to walk on. A few seats could be
strategically placed so that the old   
people could sit down and rest when    
they go for a walk. A small park with  
swings for young children could be     
placed by Stites Hill Road. Although   
Happy Valley is a large and peaceful   
common, horses tend to churn up the    
ground and after a rainfall it is      
knee-deep in mud. Perhaps some more    
picnic benches could be placed around  
the valley and some sturdier paths     
built as most paths are just mud       
tracks. Also a small tea room could be 
put by the car park near "The Fox".
