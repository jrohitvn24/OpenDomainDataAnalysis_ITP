		<title>02BEER BEACH.</title>
		<content> On Beer beach there are lots of fun   
 things to do.You can go on the fish-  
 ing boats and see if you can catch    
 anything.You can go on the rocks which
 are on either side of the beach and   
 catch some crabs and pick some winkles
 .Beer beach is curved and has a good  
 strong cliff surrounding it.The cliff 
 is made of chalk and has many small   
 caves in it.In the cliff there are    
 flints that slope to the west.It is a 
 pebble beach but it turns to sand near
 the rocks and the sea gets warmer.You 
 can swim in the sea or just sunbathe  
 on the pebbles.Beer  beach faces south
 with Beer Head to the west.If you do  
 come there will always be a warm      
 welcome waiting for you.
