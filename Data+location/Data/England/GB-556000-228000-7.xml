		<content> The Anglican church of st Mary,       
 Chickney dates from 12th century; now 
 redundant but occasionally used for   
 pilgrimages. In 1972 Chickney was     
 incorporated into the new parish of   
 Broxted with Chickney so the vicar is 
 now responsible for 5 parishes. This  
 has greatly altered the relationship  
 between the vicar and gis parishioners
 as, however hard working , he can not 
 know them all. This is concomitant    
 with the changing attitudes and values
 of society whereby the ethos of the   
 village as a united community is no   
 longer germane. Other denominations   
 are; free churches at Thaxted &amp;       
 Broxted, Roman Catholic church at     
 Henham. Population includes a large   
 proportion of Roman Catholics as      
 groups of Belgian refugees came during
 and after the 1914/18 war. They took  
 up horticulture &amp; chicken farming.    </content>
