		<title>11RYTON TOWN FARM.</title>
		<content>    Town Farm is on Ryton village      
 green. The farm has been there for    
 hundreds of years. The present        
 buildings date back to{1792}as seen on
 a weather vane. In the 18th century   
 you were charged for having windows,  
 so the farm blocked up six windows for
 tax reasons.                          
    They used to have pigs, working    
 horses, dairy cows, sheep and poultry.
 The{stables}and{pig sties}are still   
 there. There seems to have been no    
 fields connected to the farm. The     
 fields are near the{Willows}and the   
 old pit. The vegetable garden is now a
 very small hay field. Recently they   
 have grown only crops, barley, hay and
 potatoes.{The Granary,}where they     
 stored the grain has been sold for    
 conversion into a private house. Some 
 of the fields have been sold and the  
 future of the farm is unsure.         </content>
