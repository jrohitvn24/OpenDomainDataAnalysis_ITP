		<title>17B.M.X. TRACK, IPSWICH</title>
		<content>One of the most popular crazes enjoyed 
by young people in the 1980's is the   
art of B.M.X. riding.Specially built   
cycles allow fit young riders to       
perform stunts and take part in races. 
  To cope with the overwhelming demand 
from youngsters in Ipswich, the local  
council built a B.M.X. track in        
Landseer Park (see page 18). This      
allows racing around steeply banked    
bends, jumps and special stunts to be  
performed. The track is so popular that
it is well sign-posted on all major    
roads leading to the area.             
  The expensive but necessary equipment
that riders need to buy must have used 
up many birthdays,the hats, gloves,    
knee-pads, all go a long way to making 
the sport safe and spectacular.Will the
craze last beyond the 1980's ?
