 Isles of Scilly.It has the most shops,
 hotels,guest houses and most of the   
 industry.Hugh Town is the highest     
 populated area,the whole Island has   
 a population of one thousand five     
 hundred local people.                 
 The main industries of the Island are 
 flowers,potatoes and tourists. The    
 Island has an aquable climate. Spring 
 comes early and the winter months     
 experience much milder conditions than
 that of the Mainland.                 
 the Island can be reached by both sea 
 and air. The Scillonian, a ferry      
 service from Penzance,comes daily in  
 the summer and a regular helicopter   
 service also goes between penzance and
 St Mary's several times a day.
