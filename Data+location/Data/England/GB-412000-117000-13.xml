		<title>13A Saxon church in Breamore 2</title>
		<content> as can the monograms{IHS}and{ABM.}    
 Three mass clocks remain, the one on  
 the porch being minute. Seven double  
 splayed Saxon windows remain, the     
 actual apertures being in the middle  
 thickness of the wall with splays at  
 either side to maximise light while   
 minimising the weakening of the wall. 
 Succeeding centuries added other      
 windows.                              
 The external face of the tower is     
 probably original Saxon built of flint
 with{quorns}and{pilasters }of green   
 sandstone and ironstone. The inside,  
 however is much modified including the
 chancel and nave arches. There was a  
 floor 15ft from the ground from which 
 the bells were rung.This connected by 
 a now blocked door to a rood over the 
 nave. Both have vanished and the four 
 bells (recast 1922) are now rung from 
 the ground.                           </content>
