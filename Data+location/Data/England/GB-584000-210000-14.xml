		<content>      This company was founded by Mr.  
 Bourne in 1975, after the firm where  
 he worked at that time had gone out of
 business. Mr. Bourne employs 14 male  
 workers with an average age of 35.    
 They work between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m.   
      The firm manufactures expensive  
 drawing equipment made from steel,    
 some of which is obtained locally,    
 some from Yorkshire.                  
      The steelwork is painted with    
 high charged epoxy resin which costs  
 Â£3.00 per kilogram. The resin is      
 sprayed on to the frame which attracts
 it. It is then baked in an oven for   
 half an hour until the paint hardens, 
 then left to cool.                    
      The finished product is sold     
 mainly in London.                     
      The rates bill for the company is
 Â£1500 a year and the phone and the    
 electricity bills Â£1000 each.         </content>
