		<content>   This block is situated five miles to
 the south of Plymouth. The main town  
 in the block is called Plympton.      
 Although it used to be an important   
 town, (It is a Stannary Town) it has  
 reduced in importance with the silting
 of the River Plym                     
   The majority of the block is        
 farmland. The main urban part consists
 of both new housing and the historic  
 part of the town, which dates back to 
 the original Domesday book.  Most of  
 the people work outside of the town,  
 though a few work in the two          
 industrial estates.                   
   The majority of the farming carried 
 out is dairy, though there is some    
 arable farming.                       
   There are several primary and       
 secondary schools, but rather little  
 leisure possibilities for the         
 children.                             </content>
