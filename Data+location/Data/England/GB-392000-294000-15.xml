		<title>15Bradley and its Library</title>
		<content>In the library they receive about 200  
people per day. There are 500 child    
members and 860 adults. On average they
have around 17000 books 12000 for      
adults and the rest for children. More 
staff need to be appointed and people  
need to use the library more often.    
There are many vandals in the area and 
as a result the library is to move to  
Daisy Bank. The library has been on its
present site for twenty years.         
 Bradley has enough Primary schools but
there should be a Secondary School     
closer than Hall Green.                
 The area is pleasant but it is a shame
that it is so often illtreated.        
 The Industrial waste land has been    
grassed over and there are plans to    
build houses on it. At the moment the  
land is used for recreation purposes.  
 The Southern part of Bradley has      
plenty of shops but no petrol station. </content>
