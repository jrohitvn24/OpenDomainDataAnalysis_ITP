		<content> The area was originally known as the  
 Ancient Chapelry of Escomb, which     
 dates back to the 7th. century, and   
 was not covered by Domesday records.  
    Two Churches, the Saxon Church in  
 Escomb and St. Paul's in Witton Park  
 serve the area.  By tradition, more   
 servicess are held at St. Pauls and   
 the vicar has served as Chaplain to   
 the Bishop of Durham.                 
    Community life in the area is      
 slowly being rebuilt having centered  
 in the past on the Coalmines and      
 Brickworks.  These are now closed and 
 the Church serves a largely unemployed
 but vigorous, independent population. 
    Since 1981 Church attendance has   
 risen by about 10% and about 190      
 attend the Saxon Church, and 288 St.  
 Paul's each month.  This is about 5%  
 of the population.  About 80 children 
 attend the Sunday School each month.  </content>
