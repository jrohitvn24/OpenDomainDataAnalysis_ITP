		<content>           Local History.              
   The village of Newport was developed
 as the Market Weighton Canal  was cut.
 The canal drained an area of marshy   
 pasture land,known as Waling Fen.The  
 village grew along the sides of the   
 canal and the road,and the village    
 became a new port on the canal,hence  
 the name,Newport.                     
  When the canal was completed in 1780,
 clay, suitable for bricks was found   
 and a brickworks was established at   
 the side of the canal.The hollows     
 where the clay was taken from soon    
 filled with water.There are now many  
 large ponds,which are a feature of    
 Newport.                              
  Newport is in the process of change  
 as the brickworks closed in 1974.     
 There are two new housing estates in  
 the village,housing a population who  
 commute to gain employment.           </content>
