		<title>19RELIGION IN RADSTOCK.</title>
		<content> In our D Block there are eight        
 churches altogether.In Radstock there 
 are a Methodist,a Catholic,a Baptist  
 and a Church of England.In Haydon     
 there is a Pentacostal Church.Clandown
 has a Methodist Church.               
  The Church of England in Radstock was
 built in the early 19th.Century.But   
 the history of the church goes back a 
 long way.It has a Saxon cross proving 
 that Radstock was a village before the
 original Domesday Book was            
 written.Most of the other churches    
 were built in the late 19th.Century.  
  Besides the Sunday services the      
 meetings held during the week are     
 mostly to do with children because    
 there are youth clubs,playgroups and  
 Sunday Schools.The weekly meetings    
 held for adults are mostly for        
 religous purposes.
