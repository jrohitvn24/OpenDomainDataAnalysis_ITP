Our house is made of gritstone.It has  
fourteen windows,two doors and a       
stone slate roof.There are three       
bedrooms and one bathroom upstairs.My  
brother and I have our own bedrooms    
with our own things in and posters all 
over the walls.For a time we had old   
stirs that went straight down.Mr       
Fletcher the joiner in Longnor came and
made us some new stairs.They turned at 
a right angle half way down.Mum and    
Anne stained and varnished             
them.Downstairs we have a living room  
and a kitchen,there is also another    
bathroom.The kitchen contains a table  
tht is nearly 90 years old.
