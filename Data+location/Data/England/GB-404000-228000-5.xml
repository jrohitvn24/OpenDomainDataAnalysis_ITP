		<content> Much of the Norman church still       
 survives.In the 13th century some     
 magnificent wall paintings were added 
 to the church.They include pictures of
 Saints Catherine,Margaret and         
 Christopher;mythical beasts such as   
 the griffon and the unicorn;and       
 herldic panels.At the Reformation the 
 paintings were covered over,and the   
 Altar was replaced by a Communion     
 Table placed in the centre of the     
 church.Under Chrles 1 it was moved to 
 the East end.The wall paintings were  
 uncovered and restored in 1970.
