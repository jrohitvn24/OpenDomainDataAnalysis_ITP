		<title>02FARMING IN CAMBER</title>
		<content> At one time the whole Marsh  was sheep
 farming, but over the last 20 years   
 cereal crops have been introduced.    
 However the Romney Marsh sheep remain 
 supreme in this area. The permanent   
 pastures will carry two to three sheep
 to the acre even in the hardest       
 winter, and in the summer 7 ewes and  
 theirlambs. One of the first things   
 people notice when coming to this part
 of the country is the number and the  
 density of the sheep.People stayig at 
 the holiday camps are delighted to see
 and hear the lambs. The rams cover the
 ewes in November, lambing starts at   
 the beginning of April, nearly all    
 ewes being lambed outside in the      
 fields. Shearing starts at the        
 beginning of June and often continues 
 till the end of July. The Romny       
 Fleeceis a high quality long wool a   
 good ram will shear up to 20lbs.      </content>
