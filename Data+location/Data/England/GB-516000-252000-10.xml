		<title>10Traveller's Fare.</title>
		<content> Today as in the past all the          
 travellers which use the road through 
 Tempsford require food drink and      
 shelter.One advantage to the village  
 of the A1 is the amount of trade it   
 brings to the village inns. Tempsford 
 once had 4 inns today only 3 survive  
 the {Wheatsheaf }and the {White Hart} 
 which cater for the local trade and   
 the rather impressive {Anchor Inn }   
 which captures the tourist trade.     
 On the site of the Anchor was a much  
 earlier inn named the Oar &amp; Boy . The 
 boy was supposed to row people over   
 the river at the rear of the inn      
 grounds.The Anchor was a great        
 coaching inn built some time in the   
 17thC.Its prime position on the       
 fording point of the Great North Road 
 ensured healthy  trade,today excellent
 food and five real ales on offer      
 maintains this trade.                 </content>
