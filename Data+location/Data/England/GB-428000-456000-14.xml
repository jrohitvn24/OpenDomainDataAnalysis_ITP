		<title>14NEW SCHOOLS</title>
		<content>   The last twenty years have seen     
 great housing developments in         
 Harrogate.  These have fortunately    
 been matched in this area with the    
 building of several new primary       
 schools.                              
   Only three pre-war buildings are now
 in use,{Grove Road, New Park}and      
{Bilton Grange.}                       
   In the early 1960's{St. Robert's    
{School}replaced a much older building 
 in the town centre, and{Woodfield     
{Infant and Primary Schools}were built 
 to serve a new estate.                
   The 1970's saw the building of{St.  
{Joseph's R.C. Primary School}and {    
{Coppice Valley}whilst the old{Bilton  
{Endowed}was replaced by{Richard Taylor
{School.}The last to be built came in  
 the early 1980's with{Saltergate      
{School} built to serve the estate of  
 that name.                            </content>
