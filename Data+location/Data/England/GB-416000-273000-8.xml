		<content>  Communications are excellent.        
 There is a{railway}station on the main
 Birmingham-London line,and it is used 
 extensively by commuters.There is     
 close access to the{M42}which is being
 extended to the{M5}with exits at      
 Shirley and in the other direction the
 National Exhibition Centre.           
  We are only ten minutes drive from   
 Birmingham International{Airport}with 
 flights all over Europe and a few to  
 America.                              
 A regular{bus service}(182,159,152 and
 149) runs through the area and links  
 up with rail services. They usually   
 run from Solihull Station to Dorridge 
 Station via Knowle.                   
 Dorridge is situated between the main 
 Birmingham - Warwick and Birmingham - 
 Stratford{roads.}This makes road      
 travel to Birmingham and The South    
 of England easy.                      </content>
