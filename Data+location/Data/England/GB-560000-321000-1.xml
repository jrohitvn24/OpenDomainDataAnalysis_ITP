		<content>  Our block covers part of North Lynn, 
 which is a housing and industrial     
 estate and this is linked by the North
 Lynn bypass to South Wootton village. 
 This used to be totally separate from 
 King's Lynn, as the railway line      
 separated the two. When the bypass was
 built, eleven years ago, the two have 
 gradually grown together.             
 This is an arable farming area and    
 many of the industries are related to 
 farming e.g. food processing .King's  
 Lynn also has a thriving dock and     
 therefore many factories are related  
 to goods imported and exported from   
 the docks e.g.cars and fuel.          
 The population of North Lynn is mainly
 Norfolk born and bred,whereas the     
 population of South Wootton come from 
 many areas of the country.
