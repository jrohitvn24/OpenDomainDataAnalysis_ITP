		<title>15A SCHOOL HISTORY ERDINGTON</title>
		<content> Wylde Green School was founded in 1838
 and in 1840 it was converted into a   
 Boys' School. 2 teachers, Mr. &amp; Mrs.  
 James Cramp, took up residence in the 
 school house. In 1842 a uniform was   
 adopted and in 1948 it was added to   
 with a blue two-piece suit.  Plans    
 drawn up in 1905 show that 2          
 classrooms were added. The total of   
 boys in the school was 52, their ages 
 ranging from 6 to 13. In 1928 the     
 library was added to the school       
 building and the school progressed    
 steadily through the years. In 1894   
 the boys in Standard 1 form, formed 3 
 groups. 7 boys that could not make    
 figures had to be taught addition.    
 The numbers of Wylde Green swellled   
 and 2 more teachers were called in to 
 help with the education of 130 boys.  
 Girls were now attending. In 1985 the 
 school held a Victorian day.          </content>
