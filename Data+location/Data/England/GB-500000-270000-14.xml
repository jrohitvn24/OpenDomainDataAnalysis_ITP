The church in Hargrave is Norman but   
there was a wooden Saxon church before 
the present church was built. The      
church, which is Church of England, has
a tall spire. An old rector gave the   
church an organ as a goodbye gift. In  
the church there are some very old wall
paintings of a man in a red cloak. The 
church also has a stained-glass window 
over  the altar and some old Roman     
bones in a stone coffin. The present   
rector is The Reverend Eagle, who is   
also rector of Stanwick. On the first  
Sunday in every month, a children's    
service is held. Special services are  
held at Easter, Whitsun and Christmas. 
Some time during the Summer a flower   
festival is staged and in the Autumn   
there is a harvest festival.
