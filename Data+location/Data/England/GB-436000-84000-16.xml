 We interviewed a family from London   
 who are staying for a week in{Brook.  
 They said that they had come to the   
{Isle of Wight}for a peaceful country  
 holiday. They chose{Brook}for its     
 lovely walks and countryside as well  
 as its delightful beach.              
   The children aged fourteen and      
 sixteen said that they were enjoying  
 the serenity although they find that  
 there is nothing to do in the evening 
 due to the poor television reception  
 and the lack of night-life.           
   The father,a business man,is finding
 the break a much welcomed one as he is
 able to relax and get away from the   
 dusty,noisy city of London.           
   His wife is enjoying the country    
 walks although she misses the shops!
