		<title>04Life in the Camp area</title>
		<content> Miss Hall has lived in the Camp area  
 since March 4th 1910. She has always  
 lived in the same house. There were 9 
 children in her family. Her father    
 worked at Hill End Brickfields, he dug
 up clay. Miss Hall said it was very   
 lonely when she first came here and   
 that there were country lanes and few 
 houses. She and her brothers and      
 sisters came to Camp School. Where Mrs
 Soud's shop is now there was a small  
 sweet shop and Mrs White lived there. 
 She had 18 children. Opposite the     
 school there was a baker's, called    
 Parsons. They made their own cakes and
 bread and sold sweets. A milk cart    
 came round with 2 big urns. The milk  
 was ladled into your jug; it cost 3d a
 pint. After her mother died Miss Hall 
 did all the housework and looked after
 her baby sister who was 6 months old. 
 The children made up their own games. </content>
