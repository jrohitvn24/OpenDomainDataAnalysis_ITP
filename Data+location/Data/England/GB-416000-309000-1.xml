    Elford is a village of about 550   
inhabitants lying in the valley of the 
Tame, 4 miles north of Tamworth and 10 
miles south of Burton-upon-Trent. The  
A -class road between these towns      
skirts the village of Elford to the    
east and, as the nearest river crossing
is Elford Bridge, half a mile to the   
south, the village itself provides no  
thorough fare for traffic. In this     
probably lies an important reason for  
its attractiveness. There are four     
areas of woodland, the remainder of the
block is mainly arable and dairy       
farming, with transport and gravel     
industries.
