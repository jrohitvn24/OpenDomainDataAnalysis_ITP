		<title>01An Introduction to the Area.</title>
		<content>  ur area is one of outstanding natural
beauty,situated in the Chilterns and   
close to the River Thames.The nearest  
towns are Henley and Marlow.The area is
sparsely populated and is protected by 
the National Trust.Most of the         
buildings are at least 80 years old    
with the exception of a large house    
which was built in 1981.Hamble Brook   
runs through the centre of the block.  
Its source is at Skirmett and it flows 
into the River Thames at Mill End.The  
brook dried up in 1984 but it is       
flowing strongly now.In Hambleden      
village there is an inn,post-office,   
general store,a butcher,a garage and   
2 churches.Most of the block is owned  
by Lord Hambleden who resides at the   
Manor.                                 
   It is an agricultural area and there
are 7 farmers in the block.
