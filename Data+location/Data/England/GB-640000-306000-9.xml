		<content> In the 1981 census there were 47      
 housholds out of a total of 174 who   
 did not own cars. There is no public  
 service by Eastern Counties Buses, but
 Caroline Coaches, a local private     
 firm, run a school bus every day      
 during term time, and a bus service to
 and from Yarmouth twice a day on      
 Wednesday and Saturday. There is also 
 a service to Norwich on a Friday.     
 There is no train service but         
 different Norwich to Yarmouth lines   
 run through Acle and Reedham. There is
 no taxi service operating from the    
 village. Private transport            
 predominates.                         
 There is an airport in Norwich.
