		<content> In Ilfracombe there are 3 full-time   
 Doctors and one part-time Doctor.     
 They all work in the Health Centre.   
 A Trainee Doctor comes every 12       
 months.There are 5 Dentists here but  
 only 1 works by himself.The Health    
 Centre has an Ambulance Station.There 
 is a Hospital called the Tyrell.      
                                       
 People jog in the area.Most people go 
 to the Dentist regularly,but some     
 people only went every 2 years.At     
 school there is a nurse.              
 The mild climate makes it a fairly    
 healthy place to live.However,in the  
 winter, colds are frequent.Doctors see
 young children and old people more    
 than anyone-else.                     
 The nearest large hospital is at      
 Barnstaple.                           
                                       
                                       </content>
