		<title>12PRISTON CHURCH</title>
		<content> The church, St Luke and St Andrew,    
 dates from the early twelfth century. 
 A Norman lion statue can be seen on   
 the west face.                        
  The clock on the east face and a     
 golden weathercock on top of the tower
 were added in 1813 by the Lord of the 
 Manor. On either side of the porch    
 entrance are two scratch dials.       
  There is a fine peal of six bells,   
 the oldest of which is circa 1500.    
 Twelve bell ringers (6 from the       
 village) practise weekly. Six services
 are held each month, about 30 people  
 attend the 3 morning services and 10  
 the three evening services.           
  There are two large old trees in the 
 churchyard, one a yew the other a     
 horsechestnut. The latter needs six   
 people with arms outstretched to      
 measure its girth.
