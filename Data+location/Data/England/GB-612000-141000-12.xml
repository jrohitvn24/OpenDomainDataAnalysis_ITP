		<title>12A child's  typical day</title>
		<content> Normally I get up at 7.42am and go    
 downstairs for breakfast. I have      
 Frosties and some orange juice. At    
 8.15 I go upstairs and get washed and 
 dressed. Then I make my bed. At 8.40 I
 combe my hair and set off for school. 
 I get to school at 8.55 and play until
 the whistle goes at 9. When I get to  
 into the school, if it is Monday or   
 Thursday we go down to the Church Hall
 for PE. After we have come back we do 
 some work until play. At 12 we have   
 dinner. At 3.20 we go home. When I get
 home if it is a nice day I go outside 
 and play tennis or football. Sometimes
 I go into the garden and help Mum with
 some gardening. At about 5.15 I go    
 indoors and have tea. At 6 I go       
 upstairs for a bath or shower. At     
 night I go to bed at 8.30 or 9.
