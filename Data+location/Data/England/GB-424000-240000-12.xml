		<title>12SHIPSTON 40 YEARS AGO</title>
		<content>  The main change in the past 40 years 
 has been to the size of Shipston-on-  
 Stour.It has nearly doubled in size   
 during that time.                     
  Many of the{houses}in 1945 had no    
 inside toilets or taps.We know of none
 like this today.                      
  Few people owned{cars}in 1945,but    
 gradually more people have bought     
 them.                                 
  Shipston-on-Stour had a{railway      
 staion, but it was open for goods     
 traffic only.It closed in 1960.       
  There was also a cinema, but this    
 closed in the 1950s and is now a motor
 showroom.                             
  When people went{shopping,}there was 
 not such a variety of food or so much 
 imported food as today.They could have
 cigarettes rolled for them and snuff  
 was put into a cone-shaped bag.
