		<content>{MANOR HOUSE__} Standing much as it did
 in 1574 when Thomas Metcalfe died     
 there but with some windows altered   
 and a porch added. The oldest         
 documented house in the village and   
 the frequent resort of Sister Dora    
 Pattison  whose sister Rachel lived   
 there as Mrs. Robert Stirk, 1858-1877.
{THE MILL HOUSE__}This has been        
 converted into a residence but there  
 is much evidence of its former use,   
 notably the huge grinding stones. Old 
 postcards of the mill with its        
 waterwheel in place are still in      
 existence. Water from the beck was    
 used to drive the wheel and it is     
 possible to find the site of the mill 
 pond. An extensive study of the mill  
 was done recently by a local          
 schoolgirl.
