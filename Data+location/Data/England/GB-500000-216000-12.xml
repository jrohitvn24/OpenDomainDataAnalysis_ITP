 600 acres of farmland &amp; houses about  
 2000 animals which include elephants, 
 dolphins,giraffes,hippos,big cats,    
 bears,camels,chimpanzees,birds and    
 many other species.They are cared for 
 by about 40 keepers together with over
 60 technical,adminstrative &amp; ancillary
 workers of which about a quarter live 
 locally.The park,which is visited by  
 an average of 380,000 people each year
 is divided into large enclosures      
 giving plenty of space for herds of   
 antelope,deer &amp; rhinos.There is a     
 Children's Zoo containing ponies,     
 goats,rabbits &amp; other small animals.  
 The Society's aims are the            
 introduction of new &amp; curious species,
 conservation,and improvement of animal
 husbandry.                            </content>
