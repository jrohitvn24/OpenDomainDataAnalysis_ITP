		<content>    {The copse south of Roslin Farm}has
 a cross-shaped series of paths and is 
 surrounded by barbed wire. We noticed 
 that the two main types of trees      
 growing there are sycamore and sweet  
 chestnut. We found a few scots pine.  
 The only oak tree we saw seemed to be 
 diseased. Sloe and elder formed the   
 undergrowth at the edge of the copse. 
    {Along the East Yar River,}upstream
 and downstream from Beacon Alley      
 bridge, we found willow, sycamore,    
 oak, ash, silver birch, pine and elder
 trees.                                
     By the roads and fields there are 
 oak, willow, pine, sweet chestnut and 
 horse chestnut.                       
   { ALLENDALE COPSE}near Rookley has  
 one tree which is about 200 years old 
 and the rest are about 70 years. The  
 owner, Mr. G. P. Allen, cares alot    
 about nature.                         </content>
