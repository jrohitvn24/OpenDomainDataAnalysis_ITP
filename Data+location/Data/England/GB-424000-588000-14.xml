		<title>14OLD MOOR FARM</title>
		<content> In 1920 Old Moor was a mixed farm with
 sheep and  cattle but very few crops. 
 The farm grows turnips for feeding    
 sheep and cattle.                     
  In 1933 the farm changed to dairy    
 production, land was changed to grass,
 cabbages, kale and turnips for animal 
 feed. To help the farm, concentrated  
 food was bought in from abroad. In    
 1939, grain crops were very important 
 because of war shortages. Production  
 was controlled by the government      
 requirements. In 1962 milk production 
 ceased as dairy cattle (short horns)  
 were not popular. Buying and rearing  
 young calves for market followed      
 until 1968. This was followed by pig  
 production which also failed to be    
 viable. This was followed by cereal   
 production and now is producing rape  
 ,winter wheat and barley.
