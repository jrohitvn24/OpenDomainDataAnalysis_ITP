		<title>12Country Landscape</title>
		<content>    An undulating countryside, mainly  
 agricultural, with scattered copses of
 deciduous trees. The grid contains    
 three vilages and also a collection of
 houses and a primary school known as  
 Lingerfield.                          
    There are the remains of small     
 limestone quarries and the more recent
 scars of sand and gravel works, and   
 flooded gravel pits. Between Farnham  
 and Lingerfield is an area of wetland,
 Farnham Mires Nature Reserve. A line  
 of electricity pylons marches across  
 the country.                          
    The roads run in long shallow      
 curves, a legacy of the times of oxen 
 ploughing, when a wide turn, or       
 selion, was needed at the end of the  
 field.                                
    There are two fords, one at Occaney
 Beck, and another at Farnham.
