		<title>10THE DUDDON INSHORE RESCUE</title>
		<content>    This marine service of support,care
 and, when necessary, succor and rescue
 of sea going personel, professional   
 and sporting, is completely privately 
 funded from the local residents and   
 surrounding community. Founded soon   
 after the last World War by a group of
 local enthusiasts it has evolved into 
 an up-to-date rescue service with     
 modern equipment in the form of rescue
 craft and ancillary support equipment.
    Although not under the control of  
 the R.N.L.I., in a direct sense, the  
 Inshore Rescue Service works with full
 cooperation and liason with the local 
 National Lifeboat Service branch and  
 is now highly respected by all who are
 connected with the sea. The Roll of   
 Honour on display in the boathouse    
 clearly illustrates the valuable      
 service given by this organisation.
