		<content> We interviewed people of different    
 ages to find out their thoughts about 
 Laindon.                              
 Most people enjoy the country parks,  
 the open spaces and nature trails in  
{Langdon Hills.}Nearly everyone said   
 that the main{shopping centre}was     
 fairly good as it is possible to buy  
 all the basic things that a family    
 might need. However there were a      
 complaints about the{litter}that      
 always seems to mess up the centre and
 the long queues at the{Post Office.   
 We when we asked about the{health     
{centre,}most people said that it was  
 adequate but coould be improved with  
 more staff and opening longer. There  
 is no{police station in}Laindon and   
 some people think our area should have
 these services. When they are needed  
 the{police and fire service }have to  
 be contacted at Basildon.             </content>
