		<title>10Kemsing Church</title>
		<content>The Parish Church of St. Mary the      
Virgin, Kemsing is of {Saxon/Norman}   
origin (circa 1030A.D.) with           
substantial 14th and 19th century      
additions, and is constructed of local 
Sandstone and Flints.  The roof is of  
red clay tiles.  At the western end of 
the roof there is a square wooden      
turret which houses 3 bells.  This is  
crowned by an octagonal spire and the  
whole structure is clad with Canadian  
cedar shingles.  The church organ by   
R. Arnold of Orpington dates from 1973.
The memorials in the churchyard are    
varied, some dating from 1665.  In the 
attached burial ground, managed by the 
Parochial Church Council and the Parish
Council, the use of red, black, or dark
grey granite or marble, synthetic      
stones or plastic flowers are          
forbidden.  There are two {19th        
Century Lych Gates.}                   </content>
