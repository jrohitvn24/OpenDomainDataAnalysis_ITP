		<title>01  INTRODUCING LAUNCESTON</title>
		<content> Approaching Launceston you see the    
{Norman Castle}and the parish church.  
 Many buildings are clustered around   
 them with new estates extending       
 outwards. It was the capital of       
 Cornwall but now it is thought of as  
 the Gateway to Cornwall. The town is  
 in three parts; St. Stephen's, Newport
 and Dunheved. It is a{Royal Borough}so
 it has its own standard. In the town  
 centre is a War Memorial around which 
 are shops, banks, offices,            
 restaurants, hotels and a car park.   
 Launceston is a small{market town}with
 a population of 6210. It is busiest on
 Tuesdays because that is market day,  
 also on Fridays and Saturdays for     
 week-end shopping. From here you can  
 get to the Cornish coasts, Bodmin Moor
 and Dartmoor fairly easily. Around the
 town are scattered farms, woodlands   
 and parkland.                         </content>
