see out of the windows because they are
too high up.The bricks have patterns   
like stairs.There is a{bell tower.}In  
the hall a place where the bell rope   
used to hang down.                     
 On the front of the school the writing
says {Council School.}On the drain pipe
says {1906.}There are 3 new bits-the   
kitchen,toilets and 3 classrooms.The   
Hall is high and long.Some classrooms  
have doors going into the Hall.In the  
classrooms children sit at tables on   
chairs in groups.We've a {Wendy House} 
sand,water,toys,maths things,books and 
jigsaws.We are quiet on the carpet.    
There is a messy corner with           
{paints,brushes and a sink.}We all     
have trays to keep our things in.      
 All the people who work in the school

caring place.                          </content>
