		<title>12THE RUGBY CLUB DISCO</title>
		<content> On Saturday I went to Laura's because 
 that night there was a disco and Laura
 and I were going together.First we got
 dressed and then we got all dolled up.
 When we came back downstairs Laura's  
 mum said Laura looked dishy! Then we  
 went to the disco.                    
 We went in and danced for a bit.Donna,
 Lyndsey,Dawn,Helen and Laura were     
 trying to make me kiss Scott so I     
 tried to get some one to go with Laura
 but I had no luck so I chased Scott   
 and Nigel round the tent. When I got  
 back I had a packet of crisps and sat 
 down.Then we had the Pink Panther song
 and you had to have a partner,so I had
 Laura.Helen and I shared a bitter and 
 then it was time to go home.          
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
