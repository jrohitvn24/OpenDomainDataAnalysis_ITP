 Babies" spent his childhood in        
 Clovelly as his father was rector     
 until 1836.{Christine Hamlyn}was the  
 best remembered Lord of the Manor for 
 52 years until 1936 and her initials

 buildings.  The{village school}dates  
 from 1872 and was an all age school.  
 It was full during the last World War 
 with evacuees.  It now has a roll of  
  30 children. In the 19th century     
 Clovelly was a thriving port and      
{fishing village.} Many craft were     
 built locally.  At least 34 Clovelly  
 men had ships masters certificates.   
 They were mostly deep water men.

 trade in limestone,culm and           
 building stone as well as fishing.

 industry.                             </content>
