		<title>06THE PARKS IN KILNHURST</title>
		<content>   There are two parks in Kilnhurst    
 village.  The first park is near a bus
 stop.  It has some swings and some    
 climbing frames made from logs of     
 wood.  There is also a garden park in 
 which children cannot play.  On the   
 fence there is a sign saying "NO BALL 
 GAMES".  Opposite the garden park is  
 the second park in Kilnhurst.  There  
 is a slide, a roundabout and six      
 swings.  At the second park there is  
 also a sportsfield, a cricket pitch   
 and football pitch, tennis courts and 
 a bowling green.  The bowling green is
 an exact square.  The Athletic Club   
 own this area and provide a car park  
 and changing facilities inside the    
 pavilion.                             
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
