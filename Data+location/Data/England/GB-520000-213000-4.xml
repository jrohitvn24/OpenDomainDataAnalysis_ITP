		<title>04BROCKET HALL - PART THREE</title>
		<content> When Lord Melbourne died in 1848 the  
 Brocket Estate which Queen Victoria   
 had so admired was neglected and run  
 down.  However William's sister,      
 Emily, who had married Earl Cowper and
 lived nearby at Panshanger, had always
 liked Brocket Hall and was deeply     
 attached to it.  In 1837 Emily's first
 husband had died and in 1839 she was  
 married again, to Henry John Temple,  
 Lord Palmerston, Foreign Secretary and
 later Prime Minster.  Lord and Lady   
 Palmerston stayed often at Brocket    
 Hall where it is reported he liked    
 playing billiards and shooting        
 pheasants, even after he became Prime 
 Minister.  This occurred first in 1855
 then on the 30th June, 1859, Lord     
 Palmerston became Prime Minister for  
 the second time, and remained so until
 he was over eighty years of age.
