		<title>12INDUSTRIES IN BEXLEYHEATH</title>
		<content> Our area is mainly residential, but in
 the last five years there has been    
 much new  industrial development,     
 especially in Crayford.  This is      
 because we are near to London and the 
 Channel Ports, and have good road and 
 rail links with both.  We have many   
 different types of industry situated  
 in two industrial estates.  There are 
 silk screen printers, light           
 engineering works, electrical and     
 electronic industries, scientific and 
 professional instrument makers,       
 building and construction works,      
 printing, publishing and commercial   
 stationery to name but a few.  In     
 Crayford there is also a training     
 workshop where young people are given 
 instruction in catering, carpentry and
 furniture repair.  This is part of the
 Youth Training Scheme.
