		<title>07WELBECK ESTATES COMPANY</title>
		<content> The Welbeck Estates Company owns most 
 of the land in this area. The Estates 
 Office is the headquarters of the     
 organisation and runs the Farms       
 Department, the Woodyard and other    
 associated activities.                
 The Estates Company farms much of     
 their own land, but due to the large  
 areas involved, they also lease their 
 land to tenant farmers who work the   
 land in their own right.              
 Other land and buildings are rented by
 a variety of firms. For example, a    
 publishing firm use one building as a 
 book warehouse while other sites are  
 used by organ makers, surf-board      
 manufacturers, an archery firm and a  
 garden centre.                        
 Much of the rest of the land is used  
 by Welbeck College as playing fields, 
 accomodation and classrooms. Welbeck  
 Abbey houses the college itself.      </content>
