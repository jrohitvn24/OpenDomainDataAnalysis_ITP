    We went to look at home farm       
 because it is the only{thatched       
{cottage}in Mistley.                   
    Home Farm is an example of{housing 
 which is over 250 years old. The      
{cottage}has four rooms, two on the    
 ground and two in the roof. It also   
 has an extension which was built      
 recently.                             
    The roof is thatched using Norfolk 
 reed and straw. The straw is used     
 because it bends to make the top part 
 of the roof. The straw needs to be    
 replaced every twenty five years and  
 the reeds every seventy five.         
    At the top of the roof is a pattern
 in the thatch which is the thatchers  
 trade mark. Also there is a pheasant  
 made of straw on the roof which is    
 there because the owner likes to have 
 something to distinguish her cottage. </content>
