		<title>02NORTON AREA - BACKGROUND.</title>
		<content>   There is no mention of the village  
 of Norton in the original Domesday    
 Book in either text or map form       
 although by this time the Normans had 
 certainly begun construction of the   
 church here.                          
   On a roadless map of Worcestershire 
 which John Speede published in 1601,  
 Norton appears halfway between        
 Battenhall Park and Wadborough Park.  
   Norton-juxta-Kempsey (as it is      
 called), is due north of Kempsey      
 Common where people believe an early  
 settlement of Anglo-Saxons was. This  
 could be true as the Anglo 'north tun'
 derives the word Norton over time.    
   Apart from the years when the       
 Barracks artificially boosted the     
 population, Norton has always been a  
 small village with a large interest in
 agriculture although this itself is   
 now changing.                         </content>
