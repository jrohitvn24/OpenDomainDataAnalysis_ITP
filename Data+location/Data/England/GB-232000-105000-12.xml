		<content>{A DAY IN THE LIFE OF A FARMER         
                                       
{Simon Enderle }lives at Hog's Park    
 Cottage,Chilsworthy, Holsworthy,Devon.
 He is one of the few farmers who live 
 in our D_block.He is 30 years old and 
 he has a son called{Charles }and a    
 daughter called{Merie}.His hair is    
 greyish brown and his eyes are dark   
 brown.                                
       At 7.30 Mr.Enderle gets up and  
 gets dressed,he has a busy day ahead  
 of him.At 7.50 Mr Enderle goes down-  
 stairs to have his breakfast. At 8.00 
 Mr.Enderle gets his wellies on and    
 walks to the fields to check his      
 bullocks.Mr.Enderle normally gets back
 to the farm at 11.30,just in time to  
 refuel the tractors. He usually takes 
 an hour to refuel the tractors because
 it is rather hard going.
