		<title>17Celebrations - Christmas</title>
		<content> At Christmas our family celebrats by  
 putting up a Christmas tree which has 
 tinsel, Christmas lights etc. We also 
 have a roast dinner and give presents 
 to friends, relatives and among       
 ourselves. Occasionally we go to an   
 Xmas party at my uncles pub, but not  
 every year. Each year our old next    
 door neighbours come and visit us or  
 we go and visit them. Our presents    
 from my Mum and Dad are left outside  
 my sisters and my bedrooms. The       
 presents from relatives and friends   
 are left under the tree, and we open  
 them after breakfast on Christmas     
 morning. I often go and call for my   
 friend and we look at each others     
 presents. My Dad hires a video film   
 and we watch it in the afternoon. Also
 friends and relatives send cards to   
 us. Christmas is the only time Mum and
 Dad get a cup of tea made by me!      </content>
