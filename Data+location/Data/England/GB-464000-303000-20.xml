		<content> There is a police station on Scraptoft
 Lane,but the main station is on       
 Uppingham Road.There is a local bobby 
 who has a beat in the area,and he or  
 she visits our school.Once we had a   
 police fortnight and a team came every
 day.They brought a Panda car and told 
 us all about it.A police frogman      
 showed us his kit, and warned of the  
 dangers of playing near water.The dog 
 handler showed us his alsation dog.It 
 can help the police to control fans at
 the football match. A police woman    
 showed us a film called 'Never Go with
 Strangers'.Sometimes the police are   
 called out to our school because the  
 lights go on if anyone tries to break 
 in. They often go to the Boys Club if 
 there is trouble.
