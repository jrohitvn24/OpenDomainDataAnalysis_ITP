		<title>06FLEET AIR ARM FIELD GUN CREW</title>
		<content>    The men of{H.M.S.Daedalus}Field Gun
 Crew look strong and mean.They have to
 pull a field gun over a specified     
 course to represent the relief of     
 Ladysmith,during the Boer War,by a    
 crew of sailors from H.M.S.Powerful   
 who had to march their guns from      
 Durban,South Africa,a distance of 189 
 miles.                                
    The men have to pull the gun up a  
 ramp where they erect a special       
 harness and swing the gun,and         
 themselves,over a "chasm" onto another
 ramp.They dismantle the gun,push all  
 the pieces through a gap in the wall, 
 put the gun back together again and   
 then fire it three times.When the men 
 are pulling the gun you can tell that 
 it is heavy because they go red in the
 face and grit their teeth.They all    
 look well-muscled and powerful.
