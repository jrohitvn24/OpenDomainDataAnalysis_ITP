 On Sunday September 15th 1985 the     
{National Society for the Prevention of
{Cruelty to Children}held a County Fun 
 Day at Dalton Cricket Ground,Ashurst  
 Beacon. Lots of people attended and   
 many seemed to go to the fair.The fair
 had a bouncing castle.There were lots 
 of side stalls and games including    
 Roll-a-Penny,Lucky-Dip and Treasure   
 Hunt. There was a{Car Boot Sale}in the
 morning and acrobatics later on. The  
 main events were the 5km and 10km{Fun 
{Runs.}Lots of people enjoy{jogging}at 
 the moment so there were lots of      
 entries. Everybody who finished  the  
 race was awarded a medal but the real 
 idea was for each runner to get       
 sponsored by lots of people and to    
 give this money to charity.
