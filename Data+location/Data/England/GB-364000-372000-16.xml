		<content> THERE IS VERY LITTLE HOUSING OF ANY   
 GREAT AGE IN THE NORTHWICH AREA DUE TO
 THE SIDE EFFECTS FROM THE SALT        
 INDUSTRY. THIS INDUSTRY HAS CAUSED    
 SUBSIDENCE IN MANY AREAS AROUND THE   
 TOWN DUE TO BRINE PUMPING OF THE SALT-
 ROCK BENEATH THE GROUND. THIS HAS NOW 
 BEEN STOPPED ALTHOUGH A SUBSIDENCE    
 BOARD HAS BEEN SET UP TO PAY          
 COMPENSATION. THE HOUSING WHICH IS    
 BUILT NOW IN AREAS SUBJECT TO         
 SUBSIDENCE ARE BUILT ON GIRDERS.THESE 
 CAN BE JACKED UP IF IT OCCURS.        
 MANY AREAS ARE UNAFFECTED BY          
 SUBSIDENCE AND OLDER AS WELL AS NEW   
 HOUSING IS BUILT ON SOLID FOUNDATIONS.
 A RECENT NEW HOUSING DEVELOPMENT CAN  
 BE SEEN AT THE PIPPINS IN WINNINGTON. 
 THIS PROVIDES A MIXTURE OF FLATS,ONE, 
 TWO,THREE AND FOUR BEDROOMED PROPERTY 
 IN A VERY WELL LAID OUT AREA IN WHICH 
 USE OF LEISURE FACILITIES IS INCLUDED.</content>
