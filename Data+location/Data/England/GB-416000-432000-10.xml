		<title>10TOURISM &amp; THE BRADFORD AREA</title>
		<content>  Being situated about 5 miles north of
 the {M62,}directly  linked to this  by
 the{M606,}and  about 12 miles from the
{M1, }Bradford  is  'central'  to   the
 tourist trade. Over 150 tour operators
 use the City as a base.               
  A  recent  survey  of   accommodation
 found that at times hotel space in the
 City was  over-stretched and  more  is
 required.                             
  The villages  of  Esholt, Haworth and
 Saltaire  are  attracting  a   growing
 number  of  visitors  owing  to  their
 links with{YTV's "Emmerdale Farm",}the
{Bronte Family,}and industrialist {Sir.
{Titus Salt.                           
                                       
  There is often a conflict between the
 needs of the local community and the  
 demands of tourism - for car and coach
 parks, toilets and extra shops and    
 cafes.                                </content>
