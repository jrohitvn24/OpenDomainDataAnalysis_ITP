		<title>16Holiday with my parents.</title>
		<content> A few years ago I went for a holiday  
 with my parents to Rhyl,in Wales. We  
 travelled by car from Cumbria and it  
 took us about six hours to get there. 
 We stayed in a Guest House and the    
 owner of the house was called Jenny.  
 She had to get up early because she   
 had to make everyone's breakfast.At   
 nine o'clock she would ring a bell to 
 tell everyone that breakfast was      
 served. We had cereals followed by    
 bacon and egg and toast to finish.We  
 also drank tea or coffee. We went     
 shopping for presents while we were on
 holiday and spent a lot of time on the
 beach,sun_bathing.We also visited     
 Chester Zoo while we were at Rhyl,as  
 it is not very far to travel.While I  
 was on holiday I made friends with    
 some other children and we played     
 games together. I would like to spend 
 another holiday there.                </content>
