		<title>08THE LOWER SCHOOL, HOCKLIFFE</title>
		<content> The first school was built in the mid 
{1800s}when the population was about   
{400. }At that time approximately{50   
 children of all ages attended the     
 school.  In the early{1900s}one local 
 resident recalls how the children were
 punished, infants received sharp      
 smacks on the wrists, juniors were hit
 on the wrists with a ruler and seniors
 caned on the hand.  Nowadays the old  
 school-house is situated within a     
 housing estate near the{10 year old   
 present school, which is funded by the
{West Charity. }The school has only{28 
 pupils but room for more.  There are{2
 full time staff and some clerical     
 assistants. Advantages are each child 
 has more help. The atmosphere is cosy.
 The friendly atmosphere means pupils  
 dislike competition. Staff and parents
 believe the school is still open      
 because of its obvious community need.</content>
