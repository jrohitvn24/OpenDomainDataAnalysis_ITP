		<content> Philip Summers,aged 10,also in the 3rd
 year at Belmont Junior School,writes: 
 On Saturday I get up at 7.30,have     
 breakfast &amp; watch TV.At 10.30 I go    
 horse-riding at Eston &amp; come home at  
 1.I always go to Mark's house,make    
 dens,play on bikes,&amp; play football in 
 the park. I also play a lot on my     
 computer &amp; my favourite game is Air-  
 wolf.We go to our grandmas &amp; there we 
 play on the soil base over the fence  
 from her house. Also we play football 
 using the full-size goals on the field
 For dinner at grandmas we always have 
 meat, mint jelly, peas,Yorkshire      
 pud,etc. On Sundays we go to our      
 Nannas &amp; then take the dog for a walk 
 on the fields.In the evening I watch  
 football &amp; Dallas,etc. In bed I go to 
 sleep quickly but I always wake up    
 about 1,switch my light on &amp; read for 
 an hour or so.                        </content>
