		<title>11ANTIQUE SHOP, FAIRWARP</title>
		<content> Three of us went to the Antique Shop  
 by the Fairwarp village green. When   
 we went in we saw some pewter mugs    
 which people used for drinking. Then  
 we saw a concertina and a bull ring   
 spring which they used to lead the    
 bull if it was not ringed. Then she   
 took us into her house where we saw a 
 game cupboard. In this sportsmen put  
 their bullets. We saw a victorian high
 chair which had had its legs cut off  
 and an old bucket in which they used  
 to collect milk. We saw a bridle for a
 carthorse with blinkers. Outside the  
 shop there was a mangle. It was very  
 old and made of wood. In the shop     
 there was a big black pot which they  
 put water in and a head which had been
 sculpted in clay                      
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
