		<content>{THE RAILWAY STATION BRIDGE.}L.Ashman. 
    I love to stand on top of the      
 railway station bridge especially when
 a train is approaching.If you stand in
 a certain spot,it feels as if the     
 train will run over you.I get scared  
 and run screaming down the stairs.    
{VIEWS WOOD.}D.Nicholls,H.Knight.      
    I hope that in a hundred years from
 now,Views Wood will be just as I      
 remember.I love to hear the crunch of 
 the leaves and the birds singing.I    
 like to see the blossom on the trees  
 and the blackberries on the bushes.I  
 hope it won't disappear.              
{THE RIVER UCK.}I.Chappell.            
    The luxury of the river I enjoy.   
 Fishing in the peace and quiet with   
 the gurgling of the river and the     
 swishing trees.The river is a murky   
 brown but there are many fish.
