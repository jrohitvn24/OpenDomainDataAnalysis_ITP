		<title>18CHURCH FETE</title>
		<content> .                                     
 The church fete is held in the Rectory
 garden on the first Saturday in       
 September.This year the fete was      
 opened by a member of the staff of    
 Wiltshire radio.Stalls were placed    
 around the garden, and these included 
 cakes,bottles,produce,toys,crafts and 
 sweets.There was a draw as well.In the
 middle of the garden there was a merry
 go round,which some men had to push to
 make it go.A lot of children had turns
 on it.                                
 In one corner there was a coconut shy 
 and in another corner there was       
 bowling. At one time the prize for the
 bowling was a pig, but for a long time
 now it has been money.                
 At the end of the fete the prizes for 
 the draw are made. This year there    
 were over thirty prizes. The profit   
 was Â£1600.                            </content>
