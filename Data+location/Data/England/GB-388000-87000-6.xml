		<content> My School - Lady St. Mary W'ham.      
 The name of my school is Lady Saint   
 Mary First School.  It is next to     
 Wareham Middle School.  The Purbeck   
 Upper School is a bit further away but
 close enough to walk to.  We've got a 
 common by our school, so we often use 
 it for Science.  The shape of our     
 school is a sort of square.  All the  
 buildings are connected together and  
 are fairly new.  We've a hall which is
 quite big.  We use it for a lot of    
 things like assemblies, P.E., Drama   
 and lunch.  We've a playground as     
 well.  It's quite big and contains a  
 boat, bars, logs and  paintings for us
 to play on.  We have a playing field  
 where we play when it is dry.  We're  
 going to have a natural garden soon.  
 We are planting plants and collecting 
 insects at the moment for it.  There  
 are also flower beds around school.   </content>
