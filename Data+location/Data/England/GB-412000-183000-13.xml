		<title>13Old people's homes, Swindon.</title>
		<content> There are 5 old people's Homes in Old 
 Town. One of these is a nursing home  
 and the others are residential. These 
 are called Pickton, Lindum, Quarry    
 Mount, and Sunnymead. There are many  
 old people living in the area. They   
 prefer to live in their own home if   
 they feel able to look after          
 themselves. Many organisations care   
 for them, such as 'meals on wheels',  
 Community home help. Young people do  
 community service and become involved 
 with old-age pensioners as part of    
 their Duke of Edinburgh award.Many    
 people live longer today, but they    
 become a problem when they cannot look
 after themselves. Family ties are     
 loose today,as many families are      
 spread over the country, going where  
 the jobs are, leaving the grandparents
 behind.
