		<content>  THE SUN INN is on the northerly      
 outskirts of Arlecdon.It is about 150 
 years old and is built of stone       
 roughcast over.Inside the building is 
 fairly traditional.It has not been    
 fully modernised but during           
 redecorating the plaster has been     
 found to contain horse hair.          
 It is owned by a local brewery        
 "Matthew Brown" and the present tenant
 has been in residence for only the    
 past three months.                    
                                       
 THE PACK OF HOUNDS is on the main road
 near to Lamplugh.It too is a          
 traditionally built structure and     
 close to the site of the old iron ore 
 mines.It also provided the focal point
 for the local Lamplugh Sports during  
 the summer.
