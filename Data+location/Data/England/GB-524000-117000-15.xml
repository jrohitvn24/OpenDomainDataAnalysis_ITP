		<title>15SCHOOL MEALS SERVICE</title>
		<content> The School Meals Service is provided  
 by the County and subsidised by the   
 rate payers. The meal costs 65 pence  
 but a meal is provided free, to       
 children of families of low income.   
  As there are no kitchens at Twineham 
 School the meals are brought by taxis 
 at County expense.                    
  2 Servery Assistants are employed by 
 the School Meals Service, to serve the
 meals and 1 Midday Supervisor by the  
 County, to watch over pupils remaining
 on the premises during the lunch hour.
  Teachers do not perform a supervisory
 role during this period, unless they  
 wish. They receive a meal in payment, 
 which is eaten with the children. It  
 is understood that Head Teachers and  
 their Deputies remain on duty during  
 this time, but this is not contractual
 At Twineham there are no Graded Posts 
 and no Deputy Headteacher.            </content>
