		<title>01INTRODUCTION TO THE AREA</title>
		<content> The area of our 3km x 4km block of    
 land that we had to study for the     
 Domesday Project lies about 6/8 miles 
 east of the city of Kingston-upon-Hull
 The main land cover of the area is    
 cultivated farmland with a variety of 
 different sized farms located around  
 the area.                             
 There are two main villages in our    
 block, Bilton and Sproatley, and two  
 smaller villages, Wyton and Thirtleby.
 Bilton is situated on the eastern edge
 of the city and is almost in danger of
 being swallowed up by the rapid growth
 of housing from the city.             
 Sproatley is a quickly growing village
 with a big estate having been built in
 the last ten years.It has a few shops,
 a school and is almost equally placed,
 6 miles from the City and 6 miles from
 the coast.                            
                                       </content>
