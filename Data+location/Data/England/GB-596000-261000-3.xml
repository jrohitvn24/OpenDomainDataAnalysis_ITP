		<title>03ELMSWELL RAILWAY STATION</title>
		<content> This station was built in the mid-19th
 Century.  There is a glass shelter,   
 railway buildings (ticket office,     
 waiting room etc.), a signal box, a   
 level crossing, and a hut for the     
 crossing keeper.                      
 Three men work at the station.  The   
 signal box is manually operated, so   
 are the crossing gates.  The men work 
 in 8-jour shifts.                     
 We visited that station on a week-day,
 20th. June 1985.  There was a 24 hour 
 time-table.  Altogether 28 trains went
 towards Stowmarket - 10 goods trains  
 and 18 passenger trains.  One the same
 day 30 trains went towards Bury St.   
 Edmunds - 10 goods trains and 20      
 passenge trains.  11 trains stopped at
 Elmswell.The signal box will be taken 
 out in August 1985.  The station will 
 be run from Stowmarket using closed   
 circuit television.                   </content>
