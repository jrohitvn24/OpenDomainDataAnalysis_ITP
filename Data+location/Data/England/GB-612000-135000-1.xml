		<title>01GENERAL BLOCK REVIEW</title>
		<content>                                       
 The block is,in the main,gently       
 undulating.It is effectively bordered 
 to the north by the M.20.motorway,to  
 the west by the Ashford Industrial    
 Estate,to the south by the scarp slope
 of the downs and to the east by       
 Saltwood Village.There are five main  
 housing areas,Saltwood,Lympne,Pedlinge
 Newingreen and Westenhanger.The great 
 majority of employed people work      
 outside the area.                     
               It is an area of mixed  
 farming and parkland with a large area
 of mixed woodland in the south-east   
 corner.There is no industrial         
 development and the main feature of   
 the area is the Folkestone Racecourse.
               There is evidence of    
 occupation of the area from pre-roman 
 times to the present day.
