		<title>09  DAVID'S WEDNESDAY</title>
		<content> I get up out of my bunk bed at 08:30.I
 have the top bed.It takes me about 7  
 minutes to get dressed and washed.I   
 have to get my own swimming stuff     
 ready because my mum goes to work     
 about 06:45. I have no breakfast      
 because I have to lock up and zoom off
 to school. At school I have to be in  
 and working at 09:00. We do English on
 wednesday morning from 09:00 to 10:50.
 Now it is time for a 10 minutes play. 
 When we get in we get our swimming    
 stuff and coats. When we arrive at the
 swimming baths we have to wait at the 
 entrance until a teacher comes.When we
 have got changed I go and have a      
 shower.I am in Mrs Harker's group. We 
 go down the deep end.At the end of the
 lesson we go down the slide and swim  
 down to the other end.When we get back
 to school it is dinner time.We do     
 basic work in the afternoon.          </content>
