		<title>18TOWN CENTRE CHANGES</title>
		<content> There are many changes taking place to
 the landscape around Telford Town     
 Centre. Telford railway station is    
 being built near to the Hollinsood    
 Interchange. It will be quite big.    
 Fast trains will run to London. There 
 will be a walk-way to the Town-Centre 
 for passengers.                       
                                       
 The Inland Revenue has square shaped  
 offices here. Another office building 
 is Darby House which is made from     
 mirror glass. It is used by the Brown 
 Bovery Corporation. We can see it from
 our School, Queenswood County Primary.
                                       
 A new hotel is being built on Rampart 
 Way called the Moat House Hotel. It is
 close to the new railway station. It  
 will be useful for tourists. It is not
 shown on maps yet and it only seems to
 have two floors at the moment.        </content>
