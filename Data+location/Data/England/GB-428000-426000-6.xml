		<title>06A Day In My Life-D.Walshaw.</title>
		<content> Saturday morning 6.00am and the alarm 
 is going none stop.We have had this   
 new alarm for nearly four months now  
 and it never shuts up.Well,not until  
 it has been fed anyway.Charlotte is   
 my baby daughter, she's a beautiful   
 baby.Because I am breastfeeding I can 
 feed her while I'm comfartable in     
 bed.                                  
  It's seven thirty and I've finished  
 telling the children off for raiding  
 the cupboards and the fridge.While I  
 change the baby my husband makes a    
 welcome cup of tea.Tracy helps Sarah  
 and Alan to get dressed and           
 washed,then we all have breakfast.    
  On Saturday we usually have a morning
 watching television so after cleaning 
 the nappies and putting them in the   
 washing machine I sit down to feed the
 baby again watching,No 73 and Captain 
 Scarlet which is my husbands favourite</content>
