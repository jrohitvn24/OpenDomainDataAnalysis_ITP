		<title>14FARMING AROUND NEW ROMNEY</title>
		<content> I THINK ROMNEY MARSH IS A GREAT PLACE 
 TO FARM IN  BECAUSE IT HAS A RICH     
 FERTILE SOIL.CROPS GROW WELL AND WE   
 HAVE OUR OWN BREED OF SHEEP CALLED    
 ROMNEYS AND THEY CAN STAND UP TO      
 STRONG WINDS.THE REASON THAT THE SOIL 
 IS RICH IS BECAUSE LONG AGO THE SEA   
 BROUGHT IN SEDIMENT.ROMNEY MARSH WAS  
 COVERED BY SEA BUT ISLANDS WERE       
 FORMED,THEY ALL JOINED UP AND MADE THE
 RICH LAND WE HAVE.TURNIPS WERE GROWN  
 FOR THEIR SEED.SEED STOMPING BOYS     
 HELPED TO PLANT AND HARVEST THE SEED  
 WHICH WAS BOUGHT BY ESTATES ON THE    
 MARSH AND ASHFORD.THE BOYS STOMPED THE
 SEED OFF THE STALKS.IT WAS WORTH A LOT
 OF MONEY.THE ROMNEY SHEEP ARE THE MOST
 IMPORTANT.THEY ARE LARGE WHITE        
 SHEEP.THE SHEPHERDS WERE CALLED       
 LOOKERS THEY HAD HUTS BY THE FIELDS.
