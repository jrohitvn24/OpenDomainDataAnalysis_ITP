		<title>14ORIENTEERING AT BEDGEBURY</title>
		<content>   Orienteering, "The Thought Sport" or
 "Cunning Running", is of Scandinavian 
 origin and has become popular in      
 Britain with families as well as      
 serious competitors at club, national 
 and international levels.             
   Participants navigate a prescribed  
 course in (usually) wooded terrain    
 using compass and map reading skills. 
 The competitive aspect calls for      
 fitness and the ability to select     
 optimum routes, relating map to ground
 features while running at speed.      
   Bedgebury Forest, ideal for         
 orienteering, has been used often by  
 local clubs, with special orienteering
 maps based on the Ordnance Survey but 
 showing particular relevant details.  
   Saxons Orienteering Club have mapped
 parts of the Forest (Frith Wood and   
 Starvegoose Bank) and have held club, 
 regional and championship events here.</content>
