		<title>01North Frodingham with Foston</title>
		<content> A flat lowland area averaging only 25 
 feet above sea level.  It is          
 intensively farmed mainly with cereal 
 and oilseed rape crops.  A few beef   
 and dairy cattle and sheep are kept.  
 Farms are predominantly 100-200 acres 
 in extent and are owner-occupied.  The
 area is noted for intensive pig and   
 turkey rearing in enclosed factory    
 units.  North Frodingham is an ancient
 rural linear settlement with a lively 
 community enjoying a good standard of 
 social amenities.  There is a         
 significant proportion of young       
 families, many living in modern       
 private housing.  The employment level
 is high although many people travel by
 car to neighbouring centres to work.  
 Foston is a small rural settlement    
 with few amenities.
