		<title>10LOCAL ROADS</title>
		<content> Most other roads in this area are     
 small, little more than country lanes 
 with passing places.  They carry local
 transport often taking them as a short
 cut.  One such road linking the A5 and
 A6 carries heavier local traffic since
 not only is it a link road but it also
 serves the Golf Club and riding       
 stables.                              
 A traffic count on this road for half 
 an hour during the afternoon of the   
 Spring Bank holiday showed that a     
 total of 39 vehicles used this road   
 and all but 10 of them were going to  
 or from the golf course or riding     
 stables.                              
 In the south_west corner of our area  
 is the beginning of the Redbourn      
 bypass.  This was opened in 1984 to   
 ease traffic flow on the A5 through   
 Redbourn.
