		<content>{  Brickworks, Builders and Blacksmith 
  For hundreds of years the village has
 had a thriving industrial life ranging
 from iron and glass to constructional 
 crafts and textles.   Since 1899 the  
{Freshfield Lane Brickworks}have made  
 Sussex Stock Bricks nearby on the site
 of a pre-Roman pottery. Nowadays they 
 produce nearly eleven million of their
 specialist coloured, clamp- burned    
 facing bricks each year. Some of these
 are used by two local building firms, 
{Dean Edwards }and {A.R.Smith and Sons.
 Both of these businesses undertake new
 building and repair and restoration   
 work in the area. A number of other   
 self-employed builders and craftsmen  
 live locally. A {black-smith }has     
 operated by the village green since   
 the mid-seventies in a smithy first   
 set up 150 years previously.  His     
 skilled work is mainly craft ironwork.</content>
