		<title>17HOME LIFE</title>
		<content>  Home life to us means a secure,safe, 
 warm place to live.We asked young     
 people what the word home means to    
 them.The most popular answer was a bed
 to sleep on.Other answers included    
 playing on bikes and going home from  
 school.                               
  The main foods that we like to eat   
 are chips,fish,pizzas and             
 ice-cream.Not many of us eat          
 salad,cornflakes or bacon and eggs.   
  We asked our classes what pet they   
 like best. Most people chose          
 dogs,gerbils and cats.Not many people 
 chose hamsters and spiders.           
  At home the thing that we like best  
 is watching television.We also enjoy  
 playing games,collecting              
 rubbers,postcards and stamps.Some of  
 us enjoy flower pressing.
