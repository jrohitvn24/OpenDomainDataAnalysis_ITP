		<title>05OLD BUCKENHAM HIGH SCHOOL</title>
		<content> Old Buckenham High School was built in
 1935.  The Headmaster is Mr.          
 Wainwright and his deputy is Mr. Bebb.
 There are 33 teachers and about 550   
 pupils on average.  The 1st and 2nd   
 years are registered in the Junior    
 Block, the 3rd years in the New Block 
 and the 4th and 5th around the main   
 verandah. The ages are from eleven to 
 sixteen and all teachers can teach    
 more than one subject.  The pupils are
 split into four houses named after    
 famous Norfolk people, with their own 
 house colour: Crome, which is red,    
 Townshend, which is green, Borrow,    
 which is blue and Coke, which is      
 yellow.  All the houses are family    
 based which means that if a pupil has 
 had a relative attend the school they 
 will belong to the same house.  There 
 is a small swimming pool, five tennis 
 courts and three football pitches.    </content>
