		<content> Driving into the Garrison one does not
 have the impression of being in a very
 Military area.The 5,000 acre camp area
 has been imaginatively landscaped open
 plan green areas giving the atmosphere
 of pleasant rural scenery.Trees are   
 everywhere woods,copse and small      
 groups.It is good to see many small   
 groups of young Oaks.There is a well  
 planned Woodland Walk.                
 We have a great range of moorland.    
 Several streams, springs and a pond   
 are in our area.                      
 Wildlife abounds,many of the creatures
 are not so timid of man.A great       
 variety of birds can be seen Magpies, 
 Heron,Hawks, seabirds, and the        
 usual garden country -side dwellers.  
 Grey squirrels,rabbits and deer often 
 give one a second look before moving  
 off.
