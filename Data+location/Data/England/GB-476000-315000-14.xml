		<content> In conversation with residents of     
 Burton Lazars the overall impression  
 gained is one of gradual change       
 sometimes for the better and sometimes
 not.Physical changes include the      
 building of new houses,the renovation 
 of old ones and the deterioration of  
 some of the roads.                    
  It seems that although Burton is     
 still surrounded by farmland most of  
 the working residents travel to nearby
 Melton or further afield to work.There
 is little employment in the village.  
  The village was described as         
 "friendly" and "alive" thanks to both 
 villagers of short and long standing. 
 For many residents the Church plays a 
 large part.                           
   Activities include gardening, flower
 arranging and table tennis clubs but  
 there was a feeling that there could  
 be more for young adults.             </content>
