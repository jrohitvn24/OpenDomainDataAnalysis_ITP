<title>23Housing estate</title>
<content>Over the past 25 years housing has increased largely and changed massively: for example Deer Park Drive. In 1986 Deer Park Drive was nothing but grassland with horses, ponies and a small rubble path to walk along. The Deer Park Drive we know today was first Developed in 1996: 10 years later...Walking to school was a different story when you were walking through grassland with hardly any cars around.  Nowadays walking to school is a different side of the story with modern houses as far as the eye can see.&lt;br />Diary entry from 2011:&lt;br /> Walked to school as usual today, noisy, loud traffic zoomed by me I couldn't wait to get to school. The traffic was doing my head in. Especially, with the electronic speed signs. It's almost unbelievable how much one place can change in 25 years, life was much more peaceful then.    &lt;br />
