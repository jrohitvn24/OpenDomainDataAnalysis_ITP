		<title>19SUTTON STAITHE</title>
		<content> A wide channel leads from Barton Broad
 across what was once Sutton Broad to  
 Sutton Staithe. Sutton Broad is now an
 area of reed bed. The staithe provides
 mooring for holiday craft visiting    
 Sutton. This area of the staithe is   
 village green. It has recently        
 undergone extensive improvement. The  
 channel has been dredged and the quay 
 headings made good with timbers. The  
 Sutton Staithe Hotel and Restaurant   
 stands next to the village green. It  
 is popular with people on the boats.  
 This year a traction engine rally and 
 summer fete was held on the staithe.  
 The restaurant at the rear of the     
 hotel can be hired for a variety of   
 functions. The small bar at the hotel 
 serves real ale and can be very cosy  
 when the open fires are lit in the    
 winter.                               
                                       </content>
