		<title>12  The lifeboat station</title>
		<content>   The first lifeboat came to          
 Weston-super-Mare{lifeboat station}in 
 1881. There has been a lifeboat       
 station at Birnbeck pier for a long   
 time.                                 
   When it first started they had small
 wooden boats with a big crew to row on
 the oars.Years later they had a       
 bigger,stronger wooden boat with a    
 powerful engine. Later on the pier    
 changed hands and the rents went up so
 high the lifeboats moved to another   
 place.                                
   Now they use a big inflatable craft 
 made of tough rubber.It also has an   
 outboard motor to get it to the people
 who need help quickly.                
   There is a{lifeboat shop}at Anchor  
 Head where people can buy things and  
 the money goes to the lifeboat        
 institution.                          
                                       </content>
