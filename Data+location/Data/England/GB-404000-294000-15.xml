		<content> Mr Jeff Rooker has been our local     
 Member of Parliament since February   
 1974. He was then 33 years old. His   
 majority was 2023 but in the election 
 of 1983 he had increased this to 7402.
 He is a member of the Labour Party.   
   Local people consider him to be a   
 very good constituency M.P. and feel  
 confident that he will help them in   
 any way he can. He told us in a letter
 that many enquiries are made about    
 housing applications, transfers and   
 repairs. Numerous requests for help   
 with Social Security problems such as 
 pensions and housing benefit are also 
 received. Frequent enquiries are made 
 about planning and environmental      
 matters such as improvement grants and
 refuse collection. Mr Rooker also     
 deals with many immigration problems  
 for his constituents.
