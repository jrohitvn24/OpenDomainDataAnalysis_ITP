 30-150 students. It teaches how to run
 a farm and use farm machinery. Some   
 students board and others just come on
 day courses.                          
    It grows food crops but mainly     
 fodder.{Animals}are kept for meat and 
 breeding. These include 180 dairy cows
 and 2 bulls, 150 ewes, 1000 deep      
 litter hens, 80 sows and 5 boars.     
    It uses modern methods and machines
 such as the{combine harvester}and     
 tractors. It has more machinery than  
 other farms to give practice to the   
 students. Every year the farm has an  
 open weekend when the public can      
 wander round while work goes on. Ten  
 year old children at Northmead Middle 
 School visit the farm 3 times a year. </content>
