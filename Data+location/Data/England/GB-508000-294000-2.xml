		<content> The bottom left-hand square of our    
 block covers part of the village of   
 Elton.   The village is an old        
 stone-built development on the A650.  
 There are some old houses, but there  
 have also been several developments of
 new housing, and we thought it would  
 be interesting to find out a little   
 about the people who have chosen to   
 make Elton their home.                
                                       
 We called at every household in River 
 Lane, Duck Street, Hayes Walk, Brown  
 Way, Faber Close and Wansford Road at 
 various times of the day during late  
 August and early September and got 27 
 answer sheets.   The results of our   
 questions are shown on the following  
 pages.
