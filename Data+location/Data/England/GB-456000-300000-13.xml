		<content>{** MRS.ROSS INTERVIEWED BY CHILDREN **
      Mrs.Ross (80) has lived in Ayle- 
 -stone for the last 50 years. She     
 remembers when it was a village with  
 open fields between it and Leicester. 
 It was a small village with only 2    
 shops and they sold everything from   
 food to bathplugs, but if you wanted  
 clothes you had to go to Leicester.   
      She remembers that 2 old ladies  
 lived in a huge house and owned the   
 fields around. They would not let     
 anyone build there, because they liked
 to see cows,sheep and horses. When    
 they died people started to build.    
      Children played cricket and foot-
 -ball in the fields and collected     
 train and tram numbers. They also used
 marbles and whips &amp; tops. They had    
 dances &amp; concerts in the Church Hall, 
 but had to go into Leicester for a    
 cinema or swimming baths.             </content>
