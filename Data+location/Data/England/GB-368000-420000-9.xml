		<content> Between  Priory Drive and Pole Lane   
 there is about 4 acres of spare land. 
 Last year the diggers came and turned 
 all the land over.Pathways were made  
 and all the land was seeded with      
 grass.Rows and rows of young trees    
 were planted ,some are willows,some   
 are birch and a lot of other kinds.   
 When they were planted they were about
 50 cms tall and in 12 months they have
 grown to about 1metre.                
  Part of the land at one side is just 
 grass and has been levelled out to be 
 used as a football pitch.On the       
 pathways there are benches for people 
 to sit in and rest.There is a litte   
 pond in the middle.At the bottom end  
 of the area is St.Peter's school.     
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
