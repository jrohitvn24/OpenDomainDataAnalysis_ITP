		<content>      There are many old farmhouses in 
 the area. Most of the farms are       
 tenanted farms, and used to be owned  
 by the owners of Barleycombe Lodge in 
 Christon. The owner has recently died 
 and now no-one really knows what is   
 going to happen to the farms in the   
 village.                              
      Although the motorway has divided
 the Dibble's farm in half, Mr. Dibble,
 Senior divided the farm into two.  One
 son farms pigs, dairy cattle and grows
 feed for them. This is at Yarberry    
 Farm. The other son farms beef cattle,
 corn and sheep. This is at Manor Farm,
 Christon.}                            
       The farms are divided into two  
 types of farming. The land on the     
 upper parts of the hills are used for 
 rough grazing, and some cereal crops, 
 where the land is flat enough.
