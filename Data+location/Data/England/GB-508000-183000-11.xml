 uses the bus and train.               
  If she is excited about the book that
 she's writing she will write  all day.
 Otherwise she  types about  5000 words

 or writes  for another three hours. At
 4.00 pm she stops for coffee. When she
 is writing a book she does not do much
 housework.

 has  done.  She usually goes to bed at
 midnight. {'A Nurse In Time'}her first
