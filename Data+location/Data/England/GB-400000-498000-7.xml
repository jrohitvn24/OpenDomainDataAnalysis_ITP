		<title>07REETH FOLK MUSEUM</title>
		<content> Mr &amp;Mrs Donald Law created the folk   
 museum in 1974.The building had       
 previously been the Methodist Sunday  
 School,and had originally been the    
 Methodist day school founded in       
 1834.It took Mr&amp;Mrs Law three years to
 collect items fo the museum and they  
 have been adding to their collection  
 ever since.The museum has a good      
 collection of{Lead mining}equipment as
 well as{antique farming}implements.Mr 
 Law's favourite item is{a Bible in a} 
{Bible box.}It is the oldest thing in  
 the musuem, dated 1634.They estimate  
 that about 15,000 people visit the    
 museum every year, with up to 150     
 people a day in the summer season.    
        We think that the museum       
 provides a very good reflection of    
 what it must have been like to live in
 Swaledale before the turn of the      
 century.                              </content>
