		<content>      Doing the{Domesday Project}in the
 Summer Term of 1985 has brought a lot 
 of pleasure to many School children in
 this area of{West Somerset.  }All six 
 of the local 5 to 9{First Schools}have
 been closely involved as too have     
 several sections of the larger        
{Danesfield Middle School.  }Many      
 parents and residents of the area have
 also contributed.   The Project has   
 given the{teachers}at the various     
 Schools the opportunity to practice   
 the close{cooperation and liaison}that
 has been discused for a long time.    
     Apart from completing the disks   
 for the BBC children mounted a major  
{exhibition}of their work.   This was  
 staged at Danesfield School, lasted   
 for a week, and drew a large and      
 appreciative audience.   Thus         
 inspired teachers are already         
 preparing a sequel for next summer.   </content>
