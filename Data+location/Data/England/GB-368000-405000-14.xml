		<title>14Law &amp; Order - Great Lever</title>
		<content> Locally, as in most places, burglaries
 and vandalism are increasing and the  
 policeman can be seen on the beat.    
 Many elderly people are afraid to go  
 out in the evenings for fear of being 
 mugged. Some are scared even in their 
 own houses by the noise of youths     
 messing about outside, often meaning  
 no harm, but not always.              
 Glue sniffers are seen quite often    
 around Paulhan St. and under the      
 railway bridges on Settle St.&amp; Lever  
 Edge Lane.

 More and more old people live in      
{sheltered housing}like St. Vincent's  
 Court. This is a complex of buildings 
 where old people can rent their own   
 flats which are warden-controlled.    
 This gives them privacy, but help is  
 at hand if needed.                    </content>
