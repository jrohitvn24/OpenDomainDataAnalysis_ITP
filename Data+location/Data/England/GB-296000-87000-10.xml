		<title>10TOPSHAM BOWLING GREEN</title>
		<content> In the summer you can hear the soft   
 crack of wooden bowling balls from our
 classroom. This is because we are     
 right next to Topsham's bowling green.
 On most  days, especially when the sun
 is shining, we can see the white      
 uniforms of the players walking up and
 down the green. Some people even play 
 when the weather is not so good; they 
 wear white waterproof coats if it     
 starts to rain. Most of the players   
 must be retired from work to be able  
 to play during the day, but some      
 younger people play too. If you look  
 closely at the grass it is really fine
 and looks like a soft green carpet. It
 is well looked after, we see the      
 sprinklers working in the mornings. At
 four o'clock a bell rings for the     
 players to have their tea - but we are
 on our way home by that time for our  
 tea too.                              </content>
