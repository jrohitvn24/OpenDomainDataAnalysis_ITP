		<content> Charolais bull which was in a tube    
 like a straw.This was kept in a       
 container full of liquid nitrogen     
 which kept the semen frozen.Mr Tudge  
 had to use gloves when he took the    
 tube out.It would take about 9 months 
 before the calf would be born.The cows
 were milked for a second time later in
 the afternoon.Some of the milk that   
 could not be used for bottling or sent
 to Cadbury's was used to feed the     
 calves.We helped to give the calves   
 their milk out of buckets.Mr Tudge has
 a bottling machine that he uses to    
 bottle enough milk for his small milk 
 delivery round.The bottles have a     
 green top to show that it is          
 unpasturised milk.Ashford Farm is a   
 dairy farm but Mr Tudge grows some    
 crops like hay,silage and wheat to    
 feed to his dairy herd.
