		<title>02Local History-Acton/Gt.Wald.</title>
		<content>  The earliest historical evidence in  
the survey area is a Roman road to the 
west of Gt.Waldingfield.Both villages  
are believed to have been settled by   
the Anglo-Saxons.During the Middle Ages
the parish churches were built and it  
is likely that Little Waldingfield     
separated to become an independent     
village.There are many cottages in the 
area that were built during the Tudor  
and Stuart periods.                    
  At the time of the first census in   
1801.Acton had a population of 460 and 
Gt.Waldingfield 560.Both villages grew 
little until new housing estates  were 
built from the late 1960's onwards.In  
1981 their populations had increased to
1972 for Acton and 1219 for            
Gt.Waldingfield.Both are still growing.
During the last war Acton had a        
prisoner of war camp and Great         
Waldingfield was a bomber aerodrome.   </content>
