		<content>  In 1962 Mrs Watkins became           
 headmistress.When she took over the   
 school there were only 72 pupils but  
 since we moved to Hazeldon in 1983    
 there have been 120 pupils.We do not  
 know the exact date that Hazeldon was 
 built but above the side door is a    
 bell dated 1836.We know that in 1842  
 the tenants, Christopher Bridgeman and
 Mrs Ann Downs, had their tithes       
 changed to rent of Â£1.19s.9d.which    
 they paid to the Duke of Bedford.In   
 1911 Mr.Francis Southby purchased the 
 house and grounds from the Duke for   
 Â£2,100.Mr.Southby had a boys          
 preparatory school in the house from  
 about 1900.In 1949 Hazeldon was bought
 by Kelly College in memory of Kelly   
 boys killed in the war.It was used as 
 a boys' boarding house and later a    
 girls' boarding house.In 1983 St.     
 Michael's School moved into Hazeldon. </content>
