		<title>04FARMING AROUND BAUMBER.</title>
		<content> The main crops in this area are wheat,
 barley, sugar beat, oil seed rape, and
 grass for hay.Other small crops are   
 peas and potatoes. Some farmers intend
 to introduce lupins shortly. Although 
 this is only an arable area, farmers  
 keep cattle also. Popular breeds are  
 Lincoln Reds, Hereford x Cherolais,   
 Fresians used for beef rather than    
 milk. Many farmers keep sheep such as 
 Suffolk cross by texal, Scottish      
 Halfbreeds, and mules. They are bred  
 for slaughter not for wool. They are  
 slaughtered from 4 months to 1 year   
 old. In recent years machinery has    
 become bigger and easier to use. A    
 farmer will own or share combine      
 harvesters, tractors, drills, fork    
 lift, trucks and corn dryers and      
 cultivation instuments. More chemicals
 and fertilizers are used. Fields are  
 bigger with more drainage.            </content>
