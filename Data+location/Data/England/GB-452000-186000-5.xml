		<title>05East Hagbourne - Attitudes</title>
		<content>The overriding reason why people like  
East Hagbourne is that it is quiet and 
also friendly. Many also like the fact 
that it is within the countryside and  
houses are attractive. On the subject  
of future improvements E. Hagbourne    
divides into two distinct sections-the 
council bungalows and maisonettes to   
the north, housing mainly elderly      
people, and the more affluent          
inhabitants of the period and          
detached homes that predominate the    
remainder. The former group would like 
to see a bus stop nearer than the      
Blewbury road and improved shopping    
facilities while the rest are more     
concerned with village appearance -    
grass cutting, vandalism, litter etc.  
Issues that link both sections are the 
provision of a lollipop lady for the   
primary school and the wish to remain  
distinct from Didcot.                  </content>
