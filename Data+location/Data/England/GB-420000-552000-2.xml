		<content>  The most common type of house in our 
 survey was a privately owned terraced 
 house but semi detached,link villas   
 and council housing also appeared in  
 significant quantities.The ratio      
 between privately owned and council   
 housing was approximately 60:40.      
  We found that the majority of houses 
 were heated by gas fired central      
 heating although several still had    
 coal fires.                           
  Most houses had garages attached and 
 a high proportion had both front and  
 rear gardens.                         
  Within the home we found that most   
 people owned a colour t.v.and fridge  
 but less common luxuries were videos  
 ,computers and microwave ovens.       
  We found the average number of people
 in each home was four.
