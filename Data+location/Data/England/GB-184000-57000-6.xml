		<content>{Quintrell Downs Garden Centre}is owned
 by Mr Curgenven who has owned it since
 1946. He bought the seven acres of    
 land when he came back from World War 
 2. Before he bought it his father used
 it to keep mixed animals on. Mr       
 Curgenven is in charge of the main    
 greenhouse where the plants are sold. 
 He said the main bulk of customers    
 come from a three to four mile radius 
 but they get customers from all over  
 Europe.                               
  The garden centre grows nearly all   
 the plants they sell. The most popular
 plants are{roses}and{fuchias}.When    
 they get insects on plants they throw 
 the plants away before the insects can
 spread to other plants.               
  The busiest time of the year is      
 Spring and early Summer although the  
 planting and growing continues all    
 year.                                 </content>
