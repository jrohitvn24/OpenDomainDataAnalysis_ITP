		<content> When the bomb exploded on{Beacon Downe
 Sir Richard's wife and two daughters, 
 his mother,two sisters and their      
 children,nanny,the gardener and his   
 wife were in the house,an old mainly  
 Georgian dwelling with Victorian      
 additions.Sir Richard's wife was found
 in the cellar with her back and both  
 legs broken.His two year old daughter 
 also fell to the cellar from the top  
 of the house but was saved by a box   
 spring mattress which had blown off a 
 double bed in the same room and       
 landed like a tent over her cot.The   
 main stairway had disappeared bringing
 down a lot of the house.There was no  
 fire though and much of the reusable  
 material was taken away to repair     
 houses damaged in the Exeter blitz of 
 May 1942. By 1963 a new house was     
 finally built and we photographed it  
 for the Domesday survey.Neil &amp; Susan  </content>
