		<title>01SNAITH PRIMARY SCHOOL</title>
		<content> Snaith County Primary School has its  
 origins as a Methodist Day School. It 
 can be traced back to 1849 through the
 Log Books still retained in the       
 School. The first Headteacher was one 
 John Graham.                          
 The school remained in its original   
 buildings until 1976 when the present 
 school was opened.
