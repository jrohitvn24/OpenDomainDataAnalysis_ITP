		<title>06Birds of Chalfont St.Peter.</title>
		<content>  In our study of {ecology} is Chalfont
St.Peter I found the following facts   
about birds area.The {bird} life       
is large and varied. It ranges from    
the robin to magpie.The most common    
birds are the starlings and blackbirds.
In the garden behind ours lives a      
family of magpies in their spherical   
shaped {nest}.The most colourful bird  
is the bright red chested bullfinch.   
Birds in this area seem very bold.I've 
stood one foot from a {bird} without   
it flying away.Maybe this is a bad     
thing because of cars and cats.I       
questioned twenty families about birds 
in their gardens. 40% said they fed    
the birds. Bread and left overs were   
the most common foods. 40% said they   
had bird tables.25% said they had      
nesting boxes,the average eggs were    
eight and the common bird to nest was  
the blue tit.                          </content>
