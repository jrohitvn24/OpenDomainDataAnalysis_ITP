		<title>10Recreation 1 - Yardley</title>
		<content>One of the favourite recreation        
activities of the people we questioned 
was watching the television.Most of    
them preferred to watch Central as a   
channel,although almost as many people 
did not have a preference as to which  
channel they watched.No-one specified  
that they preferred BBC1,BBC2 or       
Channel 4.Quite a lot of people liked  
to watch soap operas like Dallas,      
especially women,although films were   
also popular with adults.A small       
minority of adults liked the News and  
documentaries.Sports programmes were   
only popular with men.                 
Another popular recreation was         
listening to music.The most listened to
type of music was Pop Music especially 
on Radio One,but Country and Western   
Music was popular as was Classical.    
Minority music tastes included Rock and
Roll,Motown and Irish Country music.   </content>
