		<title>06THE RIVER FROME</title>
		<content> The{River Frome}is a tributary of the 
{River Avon}and starts near Old        
 Sodbury.On the day we checked the     
 speed of flow,after heavy rain,our    
 marker took between 25 and 35         
 seconds to travel 20 metres giving a  
 speed of about 2km to the hour.We     
 looked at the trees and plants along  
 the bank and saw                      
 willows,alders,reeds,and teasels.There
 was quite a lot of polution along the 
 banks and we found five shopping      
 trolleys as well as lots of cans and  
 other rubbish in the river.If people  
 took care of the{River Frome}it could 
 be a nice place to walk by and visit.{
