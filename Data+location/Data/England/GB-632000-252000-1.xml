		<content> The area extends from light sandy soil
 in the east to marshy ground by the R.
 Deben in the west. Modern irrigation  
 methods on the former have made       
 agriculture viable. (eg. carrots,     
 potatoes and commercial freezing crops
 of peas and beans, P.Y.O. soft fruits 
 and apples, some corn). Small         
 stretches of conifers reduce erosion  
 of top soil by high winds. A large    
 American Air Base occupies much of    
 this section, and is self-contained   
 apart from housing, making approaching
 roads very busy. The marshes have been
 and are under cultivation, mainly     
 sugar-beet and corn. Apart from the   
 housing on the Air Base, local        
 habitations are sparse. Local work is 
 provided on the Air Base, and in      
 farming and horticulture, much of the 
 latter being seasonal work. Other     
 workers travel to local towns for work</content>
