		<title>12Queen Margaret's School.</title>
		<content> Queen Margaret's School was opened in 
 1901-originally in Scarborough.It is  
 governed by the Northern Chapter of   
 the Woodard Corporation and is run on 
 a Christian foundation.The school     
 buildings were damaged by enemy action
 in the war,so during the 1940's the   
 school was evacuated to Castle Howard.
 The present school transferred to     
 Escrick Park in 1949.There are 250    
 girls,with a house for younger girls,4
 houses for those aged 12-16 years and 
 a 6th form house where each girl has  
 her own study/bedroom facilities.There
 is a sanatorium with a resident nurse.
 The school educates girls to          
 university level and offers many      
 varied courses.Recent additions to the
 many facilities include a new swimming
 pool,music and riding schools,6th form
 house and an Art and Design studio.The
 junior dept.carried out this project. </content>
