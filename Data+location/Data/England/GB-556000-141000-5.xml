		<content> Many things arouse the public's       
attention in this area, such as the    
gypsies on the North Farm Industrial   
Estate. These live in caravans and move
from place to place. On 26th June 1985 
a man was seriously injured in a fight 
which took place on the Estate. This   
involved more than 30 gypsies. Another 
problem is dogs fouling the parks in   
Tunbridge Wells; a group of volunteers 
has offered to clear up the parks on a 
regular basis. Vandals are also a      
problem in this area, causing great    
damage to property.                    
 1985 was V.E.Day -40 years on- and    
many parties and events took place in  
celebration. Other reports that appear 
in the papers are of fund-raising      
efforts for charity. For example a man 
from High Brooms leapt from an         
aeroplane; he raised #170 for Mencap.  
There are many such events.            </content>
