		<title>15FARMING.</title>
		<content>    This area is hilly, almost         
 mountainous at Craswall,and this      
 affects the{type of farming.}Most     
 people in this area are employed as   
 farmers dealing in{sheep}as fatstock. 
{Lambing}takes place around February   
 and{shearing}during June.{Dipping}has 
 to be carried out before August 10th  
 as laid down by the Ministry of       
 Agriculture.                          
    Quite a few farmers describe       
 themselves as having mixed farms,some 
 keeping{beef herds.}Like most farms   
 anywhere they all keep horses,chickens
 and geese.                            
     The average size farm around here 
 is about{100 acres}with quite small   
 fields, mainly hedged.A lot of these  
 fields are kept as rough pasture      
 though some grass is sown for silage  
 and hay.                              
                                       </content>
