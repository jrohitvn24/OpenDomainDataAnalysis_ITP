		<content> The present church was re_built in    
 1773 and is only a short distance from
 Chapelthorpe Hall. The church is a    
 square, plain stone building with     
 round_headed plain windows. There is  
 one bell which is contained in a round
 bell turret. In the East end of the   
 church a beautiful coloured window has
 been placed above the alter. A ledgend
 states that it was dedicated to the   
 memory of John Mackie by his wife Mary
 Elizabeth. Inside the church there is 
 a benefaction board which shows       
 amounts of money left by the wealthier
 people of Chapelthorpe to various     
 charities when they died. The Sunday  
 school was the most popular charity.  
 The register books for the baptisims  
 kept at the Church date back to 1829. 
 The old baptismal books are kept at   
 Sandal. There is no cemetary at       
 Chapelthorpe .                        </content>
