		<content> There is no shop, Post Office or      
 village hall in this hamlet, only a   
 handful of houses, some 15 in all. Of 
 these, four have been built in the    
 last 2 to 8 years. All are of stone or
 stone-faced; 6 are farm cottages of   
 Victorian vintage. There is a large   
 old vicarage now in private hands, 1  
 farmhouse, a detached farm cottage, an
 old blacksmiths cottage and forge, now
 turned into a retirement cottage and  
 down the hill by the stream, a        
 converted old mill cottage, modernised
 for present day living. The outlying  
 farmhouses are all traditional stone  
 with slate roofs. Public transport    
 consists of 1 daily Post Bus from     
 Whittingham to Alnwick. There is 1    
 C.E. church. There are travelling     
 grocery, greengrocery and fish shops, 
 also a mobile library.
