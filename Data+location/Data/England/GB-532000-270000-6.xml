		<content> Friday.I wake up at 7.30am,get washed,
 have sugar puffs and a cup of tea for 
 breakfast,then I get dressed.I put my 
 lunch in my bag and ride to school on 
 my bicycle.After registration we have 
 spellings and english work.At 10.10am 
 we assemble in the hall for religious 
 stories and sing hymns.At 10.30am we  
 have a break,I usually kick a ball    
 about.Then it's mathematics until     
 12.00pm,when we have our lunch.After  
 eating I might play football or read. 
 In the afternoon we go swimming at St 
 Ivo pool,we either train or play water
 polo.Returning to school we read until
 we go home at 3.15pm.At home,I change 
 my clothes,have a drink and then call 
 for my friends.We might go to the     
 river and lark about or just ramble   
 about Holywell.After a meal it's      
 either T.V.,computer,or read until    
 bedtime.                              </content>
