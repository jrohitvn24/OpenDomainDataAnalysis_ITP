		<title>20Kimbolton - Conclusion</title>
		<content> It is easier to see where Kimbolton   
 has come from than where it is going  
 to.The immediate future looks         
 prosperous because of the expansion   
 already described.However,there are   
 two anxieties that gnaw.First,the     
 population is growing top-heavy with  
 mobile middle-class families:the two  
 or three generation roots of the old  
 community are being shaken by the     
 gradual disappearance of its          
 children in search of the jobs and    
 cheap houses that scarcely exist      
 here.Second,the village is very       
 dependent on the school,the future of 
 which is to some degree politically   
 vulnerable.
