		<content> As unemployment is not a major factor 
 the standard of living is good.       
 Although many people are home owners  
 there is also a small council         
 estate.Pride is taken in both home and
 garden. Some homes are centrally      
 heated, using oil, electricity or     
 solid fuel; mains gas is not          
 available. Most homes have television 
 and demand for video recorders is     
 increasing. Many houses have garage   
 facilities and one or more cars.      
 Kitchen equipment is sophisticated    
 including microwave oven, mixer etc.  
 For health reasons there is emphasis  
 on high fibre/low fat diet, therefore 
 local fruit and fresh vegetables are  
 in demand. Many people keep dogs, cats
 or cagebirds as pets, and tinned pet  
 food is available from shops.
