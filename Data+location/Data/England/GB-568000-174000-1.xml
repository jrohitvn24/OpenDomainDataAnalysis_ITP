		<title>01THAMES-SIDE MARSHLANDS</title>
		<content> A very quiet part of {South-East      
{England}which,being sparsely          
 populated,provides an ideal habitat   
 for wildlife. There is one small      
 hamlet known as Church Street situated
 north of the village of Higham in     
 Kent.  It consists of a church,a      
 public house and twenty-one           
 houses some of which are several      
 hundred years old but the majority are
 modern.  Part of the area is marshy   
 ground and farmland bisected by the   
 mighty{River Thames}used by both      
 commercial and pleasure craft         
 which,guided by a navigational beacon 
 positioned just East of{Shornemead    
{Fort},sail between{London}and the {   
{Thames Estuary}. Three forts,built    
 against possible invasion,still stand 
 at{Cliffe}and{Shornemead}in Kent and  
 at {Coalhouse Point}in Essex.
