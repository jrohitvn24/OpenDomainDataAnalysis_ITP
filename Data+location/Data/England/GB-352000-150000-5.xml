		<title>05PRIDDY FAIR</title>
		<content> For the last 600 years this fair has  
 been held on Priddy Green. At the time
 of the Black Death in 1348 the market 
 was moved from Wells. Ever since, in  
 late August, a sheep market has been  
 held.                                 
 The hurdles which are used to make    
 the sheep pens, are stored            
 permanently on the green under a      
 thatched roof. There is a placque to  
 explain why they are there because    
 many visitors stop and wonder what the
 curious building is.                  
 Today people come from all over the   
 area to either sell or buy or just to 
 visit this celebration of the past.
