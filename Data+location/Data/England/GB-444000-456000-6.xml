		<content> _Over half the families have only 2   
 children and several have only 1      
 child. More families have 1 child than
 3 children. There are approximately 14
 pre-school children 34 primary school 
 children approximately 20 secondary   
 school children. Most houses have only
 2 adults there but a few have working 
 young people at home.More people have 
 moved here than were born here.Few    
 fathers work in Green Hammerton they  
 travel to Knaresbrough,York,Harrogate 
 or Leeds.Many mothers have part time  
 jobs in the village or at Whixley.    
 Most people go to work by car. A very 
 small number travel by bus or cycle.  
 Green Hammerton has only one shop/post
 office,important for people who have  
 no car. For big supermarket shops,    
 clothes,dentists and opticians we have
 to go to York, Borobridge,            
 Knaresbrough or Harrogate or Leeds.   </content>
