		<title>13   The Flood Relief Scheme</title>
		<content> The dam is made out of clay and       
 soil.There is a tunnel made with      
 concrete pipes going under the        
 dam,and just at the beginning of the  
 pipes there is a grid which stops     
 branches and other debris going in to 
 the river.When the tunnel is full of  
 water,the level will rise up the dam. 
   Built up the side of the dam are    
 three boxes of metal that set off an  
 alarm at the Wessex Water Board,so    
 they are warned if the land is in     
 danger of flooding.                   
   The River Brue has been straightened
 out and directed through the dam.     
   The flood relief scheme should stop 
 the problem of flooding in Bruton.The 
 River Brue has often flooded in the   
 past.It is now working satisfactorily.
