 Gawsworth is a small village lying on 
 the Cheshire plain in the  east of the
 county.Its height above sea level is  
 500 feet.                             
 The village sits on a plateau between 
 two raised pieces of land, to the     
 north Gawsmoor Hill and to the south  
 the Mount. The highest land lies to   
 the east bordering on the Pennine     
 hills, while to the west flat farming 
 land stretches out on the plain.      
 There are several features which      
 should be noted, the Gawsworth block  
 is bisected by Ben brook which joins  
 Gandys brook in the south.To the east 
 a large area of marsh waste land      
 occurs, Danes Moss.                   
 The development of the village is on  
 a north/south axis.

 with minimal urban development.       </content>
