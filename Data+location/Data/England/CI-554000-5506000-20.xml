		<title>20The States of Alderney</title>
		<content>  After WWII, when the island had      
 been evacuated, a new constitution was
 drawn up to try and revive the        
 island's economy and to regulate it's 
 position with regard to Guernsey      
 within the Bailiwick.This allowed for 
 Alderney to be run independently by   
 it's own States but for certain areas 
 (such as policing) and any debts to be
 overseen by Guernsey.There is some    
 disquiet about these arrangements as  
 many would like to see more freedom to
 run their own affairs. The States are 
 made up of 12 members who sit for 3   
 years and 4 of whom stand down every  
 year.Their chairman is the President  
 who is also elected for a term of 3   
 years.The island is run through a     
 series of committees. One fault of the
 system is said to be lack of          
 continuity.One feature of the system  
 is the People's Meeting.              </content>
