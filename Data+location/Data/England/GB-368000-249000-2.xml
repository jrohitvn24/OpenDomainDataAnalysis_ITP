		<content> There is every opportunity to learn   
 and improve all sorts of crafts with  
 evening classes in: upholstery,       
 painting, dressmaking. embroidery,    
 woodwork, welding, and many others.   
 Classes are run by the Education      
 Authority in Bromyard, Malvern, and   
 Hereford, and in Stanford Bishop Vill-
 age hall. The Women's Institute       
 arranges speakers and demonstrations. 
 Many people practise crafts  like     
 cake icing and flower arranging for   
 local weddings and birthdays, and for 
 competitions. Rugs and kneelers are   
 made for the church, and curtains for 
 the village hall. Many in the area    
 enter for competitions at Bromyard    
 Gala which includes painting, photo-  
 graphy, woodwork, flower arranging,   
 cookery, country wines, patchwork, and
 handicrafts. Matches are held for
