		<content>        Mr. and  Mrs. Tancock,  of Tree
 Farm,  keep  76  cows and  60 sheep on
 their 104 acre farm  at Metherell.  In
 summer  the  animals  are  kept in the
 fields   and  the  cows   are   milked
 mornings and evenings.  Silage and hay
 are made for indoor winter feeding and
 crops are sprayed to control weeds. In
 Autumn  the  grain  is  harvested  and
 straw baled for winter bedding for the
 animals.  Potatoes are dug  and stored
 for the shops  in the winter.  Some of
 the fields  are  ploughed  and  tilled
 before Christmas and when the days get
 shorter the animals are all kept under
 cover.  Pipes  are  lagged to ensure a
 water  supply   during    the   frosty
 weather.  Sheep are kept indoors ready
 for  lambing and waiting for the grass
 to  grow  to  provide  them  with food
 outdoors.
