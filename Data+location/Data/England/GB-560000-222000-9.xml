		<content> Most of the land at Godfrey Way and   
 The Maltings was farm land and some of
 it belonged to the Dunmow Brewery.    
 Jerram,the builders started building  
 in 1976,they hope to finish in 1987.  
 The site covers 8 acres of ground     
 which is divided into 98 plots.The    
 foundations go 2metres below ground   
 and some need concrete piles which go 
 down 10metres because the ground is   
 very soft.Each house takes about 12000
 bricks,40bags of cement and 450litres 
 of water.From the time they started   
 building,the prices of houses have    
 doubled and the builders expect the   
 prices to go up dramatically when     
 Stansted Airport expands.There are    
 about 26 men on the site building     
 traditional style houses.They get     
 bricks from the London Brick Company  
 and from Kent.Pickford builders will  
 soon be building new houses in Dunmow.</content>
