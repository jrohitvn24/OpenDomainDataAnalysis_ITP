		<title>17Farming on the edge of Derby</title>
		<content> Farming patterns in the area reflect  
 the differing soils and the proximity 
 to the urban area.Much of the city is 
 built on alluvial gravels. On this    
 level land the water table is always  
 close to the surface resulting in wet 
 soils suitable for grazing. Further   
 south the undulating land is underlain
 by glacial till which is more suited  
 to arable farming although there are  
 large areas of grazing. On this       
 grassland many farmers keep{Fresian}  
 dairy cattle although cross bred beef 
 breeds are not uncommon and sheep have
 also been observed. Most of the arable
 land is devoted to barley with some   
 wheat but a relative newcomer is      
{oil-seed rape,}whose yellow flowers   
 transform the fields in May.
