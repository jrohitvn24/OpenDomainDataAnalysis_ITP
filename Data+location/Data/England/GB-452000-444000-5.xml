 Mrs.Davies aged 67 was born in the    
 village and has spent her life here.  
 She lived at the Old Manor House with 
 her mother,Mrs.Jackson.This lady      
 assisted by her family had a milk     
 round.She had her own cows and milk   
 was delivered by pony and trap.She    
 took milk to Askham Richard and Colton
 too.Now there are 2 milkmen delivering
 by milk floats.Mrs.Davies remembers   
 the army huts near the village hall.  
 These were used for agricultural      
 workers,although they had been        
 intended to house refugees.Where the  
 huts stood,there is now a pleasant    
 bungalow.The village hall was used for
 first aid classes,lectures, and the   
 Womens Institute.The W.I.has now      
 disbanded.
