		<title>20Fen Ditton Surgery</title>
		<content> The Fen Ditton surgery is held each   
 Tuesday morning in a small terraced   
 house containing two bedrooms, two    
 downstairs rooms and an extension     
 with kitchen, bathroom and toilet. The
 house is occupied by Mr. and Mrs. Tuck
 and their two teen-age daughters.     
 On surgery day the lounge becomes the 
 waiting-room and the dining-room      
 becomes the surgery, with the dining- 
 table serving as the doctor's desk. A 
 bureau serves as a medicine cabinet   
 in which some drugs are stored, so    
 that at all other times it must remain
 locked. The doctor washes his hands   
 when necessary in the kitchen sink.   
 His main surgery is at Milton.        
 Through an intercom system, some local
 elderly people can indirectly contact 
 Mrs. Tuck if they are ill. She then   
 visits them and alerts the doctor if  
 she feels it is necessary.            </content>
