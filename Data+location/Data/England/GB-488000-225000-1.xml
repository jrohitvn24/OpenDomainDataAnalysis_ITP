		<content> Soulbury/Linslade is situated on the  
 Bucks/Beds border in gently rolling   
 countryside with the canal and railway
 passing through.Being a short train   
 ride away from London it is considered
 a desirable place in which to live and
 houses are difficult to find          
 especially in Soulbury where prices   
 are high.                             
 The area avoided the brutal           
 development of the 1960's and averted 
 the siting of London's third airport  
 on its doorstep in the 60's  and 70's.
 The development of the new city Milton
 Keynes has made a great difference to 
 the lives of the local people as they 
 now have easier access to a large     
 shopping centre and leisure centres,  
 cinemas and libraries.                
 Events this year included several     
 fetes, the Harvest Supper, Bingo,     
 jumble sales and carol singing.       </content>
