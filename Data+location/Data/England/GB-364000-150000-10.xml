		<title>10VILLAGE AMENITIES</title>
		<content> Becky and myself interviewed an old   
 resident in the village.She told us   
 that the{friendliness}of the village  
 hadn't really changed in the last     
 forty years even though many new      
 people had moved into the area.She    
 felt that the newly built houses      
 improved the village because new      
{amenities}had been built.There was now
 a Catholic Church, a village hall, a  
 rifle range and a playing area for    
 children with slides, climbing frames,
 swings and other apparatus.She talked 
 about the new{Village Hall}that was   
 built in 1981 thanks to the efforts of
 the villagers in{fund raising.}It     
 consists of a main hall,two meeting   
 rooms and a kitchen.In 1984 it was    
 presented with a cup for the best kept
 village hall in Somerset.It has become
 the{centre of village life}with many  
 activities eg. playschool,discos,etc. </content>
