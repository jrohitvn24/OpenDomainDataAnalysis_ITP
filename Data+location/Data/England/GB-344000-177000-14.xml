 The man that owned the Royal Hotel    
 said that he had been working there   
 for eight years. His name is Eric     
 Johnson. He said  that he would       
 like  to move  but not  just  yet     
 He said  that he gets  hundreds       
 of people  staying  there in one      
 week. When  we  went  there  he       
 said that he had six bedrooms to      
 let. When we knocked on the door an   
 old lady answered.She said they had   
 three cleaners working there and      
 quite a  few  other staff but Eric    
 could  not  say  how many.The pub had 
 a restaurant joined on,and some       
 tables and some swings out side.
