		<title>01INDUSTRY IN A VILLAGE</title>
		<content>To the east of the village of Chedburgh
pop. 490 along the A143 is a small     
industrial estate, including among     
others, a chemical plant Chafers Ltd.  
Chafers assure us there is no hazard   
but their lorries are only allowed to  
travel through the village empty. A    
warning siren has been installed,      
sounding similiar to the 'all clear' in
the last war. The siren is tested every
1st Thursday in the month at 5.00 pm   
for approx. 2 mins. If the siren is    
sounded at any other time the you are: 
1. Go to your own home                 
2. Close all windows and doors         
3. Stay in your home until the Police  
   or the specially trained Emergency  
   Officer says it is safe to leave    
The Board Room of Chafer Ltd. is in    
what was the Officers Mess of the      
Lancaster Bomber Base in the war. A    
bomber is included in our village sign.</content>
