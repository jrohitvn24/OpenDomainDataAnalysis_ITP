		<content> NEWBIGGIN USED TO BE A DESERT. THE    
 MOST POPULAR ROCK IS THE SAND STONE.  
 IN THE FUTURE IF THE POWER STATION WAS
 TO CLOSE DOWN THE N.C.B. WOULD HAVE TO
 RESTORE THE{BEACHES}BACK TO THEIR     
 ORIGINAL WAY WHICH WOULD BE A FOREST. 
 THE NAMES OF SOME OF THE{FLOWERS}AND  
{SHRUBS}THAT WE SAW WERE CREEPING RED  
 FESTOW,CUCKOO RASS, MOUSE EARS,       
 SCURVEY GRASS,AND SOME GREENERY CALLED
 ALGAE.                                
 SOME OF THE{BIRDS}WE SAW WERE CALLED  
 BLACK HEADED GULL,LITTLE RINGED       
 PLOVER,CROW, AND A LITTLE BIRD CALLED 
 WHITE WINGED PIPPET. THE HORSES THAT  
 GRAZE THERE PREVENT THE SHRUBS GROWING
 LARGER WHEN THEY STAND ON THEM AND EAT
 THEM.THEN WE SAW SOME CONCRETE BLOCKS 
 FROM THE WORLD WAR TWO. TO STOP ENEMY 
 TANKS FROM GETTING UP THE BEACHES.
