		<content>UNTIL ABOUT 50 YEARS AGO OUR BLOCK WAS 
FARMLAND ON THE EDGE OF BIRMINGHAM WITH
A COUPLE OF SMALL VILLAGES AND A FEW   
FARM HOUSES                            
IN THE 1930'S A NEW MAIN ROAD WAS BUILT
AND A NEW HOUSING ESTATE IN PYPE HAYES.
OTHER HOUSES WERE BUILT PRIVATELY ALONG
2 OTHER MAIN ROADS.THE NEXT BIG ESTATE 
WAS BUILT IN THE 1960'S.NOW,TO GET TO  
THE COUNTRYSIDE WE HAVE TO GO SEVERAL  
MILES                                  
 ALL HOUSES NOW HAVE INSIDE BATHROOMS  
AND TOILETS AND AT LEAST 2 BEDROOMS.   
SOME OF THE COUNCIL HOUSES ARE BEING   
BOUGHT BY THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN THEM. 
MANY OF THE HOUSES LOOK ALL THE SAME   
WITH JUST A FEW LITTLE DIFFERENCES.    
IN THE HOUSES MOST PEOPLE HAVE T.V.    
FRIDGES,AND VIDEOS.THE ROADS ARE A     
BIT NARROW SO SOME PEOPLE WHO DO NOT   
HAVE GARAGES HAVE TROUBLE PARKING      
THEIR CARS.                            </content>
