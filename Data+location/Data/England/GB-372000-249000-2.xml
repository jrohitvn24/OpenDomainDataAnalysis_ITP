      The area is one of Old Red       
 Sandstone and clay and is noted for   
 its outstanding beauty.  It has had   
 the reputation of being a hop and soft
 fruit growing area, but this has      
 changed dramatically within the last  
 ten years.  There are now only two    
 farms which produce hops, Winthill and
 Stocks farms.  Many apple orchards    
 have been replaced by cereals, root   
 vegetables and soft fruit for the     
 'pick your Own' market.  The cherry   
 orchards, growing Red and White       
 Hearts, Waterloo and Wellingtons, are 
 coming to the end of a profitable life
 and will not be replaced.  Stocks Farm
 at Suckley has eleven acres of vines  
 of the Muller-Thurgan variety.  There 
 are 15,000 vines, which are bottled as
 Stocks Riesling Sylvaner.             </content>
