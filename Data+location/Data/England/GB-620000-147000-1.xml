		<title>01 Barham.General Information.</title>
		<content>   Our survey area lies south and east 
of Barham,where our school is          
situated.It is a lightly-populated     
{rural area}of natural beauty,with many
farms and areas of woodland.Barham,in  
the north-west corner of the map,is the
largest village,and the villages of    
Denton in the south and Woolage Green  
in the north-east are the main centres 
of population.The area has a central   
position in East Kent,and it is        
approximately 10 miles from the Channel
ports of Dover and Folkestone.Heavy    
traffic,including much holiday traffic 
travelling between London and          
the coast,uses the A2 trunk road,which 
passes through the area.The Kent       
coalfield is nearby,and the city of    
Canterbury is 6 miles away.Many        
historical events have taken place in  
the vicinity.
