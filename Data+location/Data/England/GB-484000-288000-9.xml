		<content>The baths were opened in 1968. The     
amount of water in the pool is 2030    
gallons. Average attendance is 300     
daily, and about 40 disabled people use
the baths. About 30 galas are held each
year. Attendance has not been affected 
by the recent opening of Kettering     
baths The manager said that 85% of     
users were children. Swimming was a fun
activity, only 15% doing it for        
fitness. It is an increasingly popular 
activity, though adults stop coming in 
the winter. Adults pay 60p for         
admission, juniors 35p, with no free   
entry for the unemployed. 2-3          
attendants are always on duty, and had 
to rescue only 6-7 per year. Video     
scanners had reduced vandalism. The    
snack bar, which used to be manned by  
staff, now offers drinks and snacks    
from vending machines. It is very      
popular.                               </content>
