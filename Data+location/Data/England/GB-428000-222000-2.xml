		<content>                                       
  Churchill as a Parish dates back to  
 early Saxon times.  The original name 
 is thought to have been Cru Wiella    
 (Cru = hill and Wiella = a spring).   
 The first written record of Churchill 
 is the Domesday survey of 1086.       
  The original Churchill was situated  
 around the old church at the          
 north-west corner of the present      
 village with the medieval manor house 
 nearby.   By 1684 the village was     
 dilapidated, and was finally abandoned
 after a fire which destroyed 20       
 houses.                               
  In 1792 the village and 6,000 acres  
 was bought by James Haughton Langston,
 whose son of the same name rebuilt    
 much of the village, higher up the    
 hill, as well as many houses in the   
 surrounding countryside.
