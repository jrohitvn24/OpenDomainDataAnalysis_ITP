		<title>15A View from "Hill Top"</title>
		<content> We stood on{Hill Top Road}looking     
 eastwards. To our right there were    
 houses with a{water tower}at the      
 highest point.{Cooling towers}and a   
 chimney on the horizon. Continuing    
 left we see{rough grassland}and a few 
 deciduous trees. The land then changes
 to{fields}used for crops and is marked
 out by{fences, hedges and trees.}The  
 land rises in front of us and on the  
 Hill Top we can see{farm buildings   }
 almost totally surrounded bytrees and 
 a{wood}of deciduous trees to its      
 right. In the distance we can see     
{Hoober Stand.}Behind us, the{Thicks, }
 known by the locals as{"The 20 Acre",}
 divides the two{new housing estates}at
 Denaby and Conisbrough. In the        
 distance we see{disused pit head gear 
 and a{derelict power station.}Looking 
 up hill we see the roof tops of some  
 new houses.                           </content>
