Houses are well spaced throughout the  
area, even in very inaccessible parts. 
In Fairoak and Croxton there are       
Council houses, in Fairoak they are    
backed by a lovely plantation of trees,
and the Croxton houses have a          
magnificent veiw.  Farm houses         
predominate the accommodation. They are
either privately owned together with   
the farm or are rented with the farm   
from an estate or the Church           
Commissioners.                         
Newcomers to the area have purchased   
and converted old houses and commute   
daily.  The conversions are pleasing   
and show that thought has been given to
the preservation of the original       
building.                              
There is one Georgian Hall, Sugnall    
Hall, but no other notable large       
houses.                                </content>
