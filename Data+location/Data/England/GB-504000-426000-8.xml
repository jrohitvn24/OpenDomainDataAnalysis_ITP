		<title>08PICKERING PARK: WEST HULL</title>
		<content>  The land for the park was the gift of
 Christopher Pickering. Mrs Pickering  
 performed the opening ceremony in     
 1911,unlocking the wrought-iron gates 
 with a gold key.                      
  The gates open onto an avenue lined  
 with varieties of maple trees. In the 
 grassy areas of the park there are    
 mature horsechestnuts,willows, oaks   
 and beeches together with small copses
 of silver birch and willow.The trees  
 and shrubs have been chosen to give   
 colour throughout the year.           
 Formal rose beds contrast with the    
 rock garden and its abundance of      
 alpine and water plants.              
 The lake is popular for fishing,      
 feeding the geese and ducks and       
 boating in summer.                    
 The aviaries house many tropical birds
 but it is the white peacocks which    
 attract the most attention.           </content>
