		<content> Bright Steels have built up a         
 world-wide reputation for the         
 precision of its finished products    
 after they have passed through the    
 various shaping and cleaning          
 processes.                            
                                       
 The firm takes delivery of hot-rolled 
 steel bars from the mills. These are  
 usually covered in scale and rust.    
                                       
 Bright Steels clean up the            
 mill-produced lengths of round, flat, 
 square or hexagonal shaped dull steel 
 before drawing and elongating them    
 into the shape and form required by   
 the firm's customers.                 
                                       
 Bright Steels can provide bars to     
 ordered sizes with tolerances to a few
 thousandths of an inch and to exact   
 shape and section.                    </content>
