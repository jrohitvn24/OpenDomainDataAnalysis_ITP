  Situated off the quiet Henwood Lane  
 is the Isolation Hospital. It was     
 built at the beginning of the century 
 to care for victims of Scarlet Fever. 
 Later it became an extension for      
 Solihull Hospital Maternity Unit in   
 the 1950's. Later it was used to have 
 refugee's from the war in Indo-China. 
  It was last used in 1981 to isolate  
 two smallpox victims, a father and    
 daughter. The daughter, a technician  
 at Birmingham University later died,  
 but her father survived. At present   
 the hospital remains empty, but is    
 looked after by a warden and his wife.
