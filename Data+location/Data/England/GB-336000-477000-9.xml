{fEARON'S FARM                         
 On Sunday the 20th of ctober 1985 I   
 went to Mr. Fearon's farm.  I asked   
 him a few questions.  Mr. Fearon's    
 family have farmed there for three    
 generations.  He keeps dairy cattle.  
 He sells off the old ones and the bull
 calves.  The rest are kept for        
 milking.  His farm is 121 acres. The  
 most important crop is silage, grown  
 for winter food for the cows. Most of 
 the farm machinery is connected with  
 silage cutting, collecting and        
 storage.                              
 The cows are Friesians.               
 The disorders Mr. Fearon has to look  
 out for most are milk fever and grass 
 staggers.
