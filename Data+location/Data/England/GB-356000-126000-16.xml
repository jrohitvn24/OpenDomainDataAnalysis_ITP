		<title>16POST OFFICE</title>
		<content>        The Post Office at Babcary is  
 very small and classified as Grade II.
 It deals with both overseas and inland
 letters, and only small packages. Like
 most Post Offices it issues Television
 stamps and postage stamps             
        It also serves as the village  
 confectionary shop, and sells sweets  
 and drinks, but it does not sell      
 actual food for meals.                
        Business is low, and due to the
 little business Babcary's only shop   
 will close down sometime during July  
 this year.                            
        Situated in the middle of      
 Babcary, the Post Office is growing   
 smaller and smaller every month, and  
 after July the people in Babcary will 
 have to go elsewhere for their stamps.
