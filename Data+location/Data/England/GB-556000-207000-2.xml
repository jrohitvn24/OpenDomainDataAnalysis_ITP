		<content> area this year.                       
 Among themany wild flowers which grow 
 are the Bee Orchid and the Fyfield Pea
 (Lathyrus tuberosus ).                
 There are no shops in this area.  The 
 only village shop at Willingale was   
 closed in l984.    There are three    
 churches (two within the same         
 churchyard).  The village school in   
 Willingale was closed in July l985.   
 The character of the area has changed 
 within the last twenty years as the   
 number of farm workers has decreased  
 owing to mechanisation.  Farm         
 labourers cottages have been sold to  
 people who work out of the area.      
 There are only a very few people who  
 live and work within the area.
