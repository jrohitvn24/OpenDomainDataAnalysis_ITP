		<title>05MY MAY DAY HOLIDAY</title>
		<content> I woke up at 8a.m. and went downstairs
 to watch T.V.I dressed at about 8.30  
 and had a breakfast of cornflakes.At  
 9.30 we all got in the car and visited
 an antique fair on the Tuxedo         
 Princess,a ship moored on the River   
 Tyne in Newcastle.I bought some coins 
 for my collection.                    
 Later in the day we visited Tanfield  
 Railway and rode on an old steam train
 then bought some mementoes.We watched 
 some rock climbers at the nearby      
 Causey Arch for a while then returned 
 home at about 5.30 p.m.               
 We had a big tea of steak and         
 vegetables. I later helped my dad in  
 the garden,then cleaned out the fish  
 tank with my sister.I read a book for 
 an hour,then had supper before going  
 to bed at 10 p.m.
