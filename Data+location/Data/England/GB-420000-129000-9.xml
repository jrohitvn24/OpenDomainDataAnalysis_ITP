		<title>09EMPLOYMENT IN FARLEY</title>
		<content> Although there is a lot of farmland   
 around Farley, most people do not work
 on the farms. Some of the jobs people 
 do are aircraft engineer manager,     
 self-employed spar maker, chef, seller
 of swimming pools, doctor, carpenter, 
 scrap man, British Telecom engineer,  
 car body builders, Airline pilot,     
 builder, farmer and farm manager.     
 Obviously most of these have to travel
 to work. The furthest anyone travels  
 is to Heathrow Airport, London and    
 that is the pilot.                    
 There are eight farms in Farley, dairy
 farms, chicken farms and mixed farms. 
 Mr. Parsons has the largest mixed farm
 with a big Freisan dairy herd. There  
 are two chicken farms which keep the  
 hens in large chicken huts. One sells 
 the eggs mainly and the other sells   
 the hens.                             
                                       </content>
