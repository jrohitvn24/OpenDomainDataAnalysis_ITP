		<title>18GLIDING_ HUSBANDS BOSWORTH</title>
		<content> It was first built as an airfield in  
 the 2nd world war,then it was derelict
 for a while before the Coventry       
 gliding club took over. Most of the   
 gliders there are towed up by small   
 aeroplanes or tractors. They are just 
 towed up until they get high enough   
 then the glider lets go of the rope.  
 It is the same process with the       
 tractors. The chairman of the Gliding 
 Club is Mr.Middleton.Lots of people   
 keep caravans on the airfield and go  
 down for a weekend. Once a year the   
 Gliding Club has an Open Day when     
 anybody can go to the airfield and    
 have a ride in the gliders if they    
 want to.Normally in September there   
 is a rally on the airfield with steam 
 engines and a fair.There is still     
 quite a bit of the original airfield  
 where sheep are grazed.There are some 
 old runways and derelict buildings.   </content>
