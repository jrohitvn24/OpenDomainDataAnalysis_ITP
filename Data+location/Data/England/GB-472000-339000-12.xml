		<title>12ASLOCKTON TRAIN STATION</title>
		<content> The Aslockton train station runs 24   
 hours a day 7 days a week. It is      
 always manned because there is        
 also a level crossing. Each           
 shift lasts 8 to 12 hours. There      
 are an average of 34 trains through a 
 day.There are more passengers trains  
 than goods trains.The busiest days are
 Thursdays and Fridays. There are two  
 tracks one leads to Grantham, which is
 a main inter-city station, and the    
 other leads to Nottingham.There are   
 three stops before Nottingham Bingham,
 Netherfield, and Radcliffe. The lines 
 future is quite secure, because the   
 passenger trains are very convenient. 
 There is a very limited bus service   
 into Nottingham, and an even poorer   
 one to Bingham; So most people who    
 work in the city use the train as it  
 is cheap and quick.
