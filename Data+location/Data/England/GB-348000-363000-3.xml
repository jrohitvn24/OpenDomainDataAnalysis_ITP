		<title>03AGRICULTURE- a smallholding.</title>
		<content>   My name is Melissa. Behind our      
 garage is a smallholding.  We have    
 pigs, calves, hens and a peafowl. We  
 keep the pigs to breed from; later on 
 we wean them and eventually sell them.
 My Dad feeds the pigs and my Mum the  
 calves and the hens. The shed that the
 animals are kept in is long and tall  
 with a loft, in which we keep all the 
 hay and straw.  My Dad feeds the pigs 
 on sour milk which comes from the     
 dairy;  fresh milk is fed to the      
 calves.                               
                                       
   I just like watching and messing    
 about!  I have a pet cockerel called  
 Maggie which sits on my head.
