		<title>04 LIFE IN BURY GREEN</title>
		<content>                                       
This is a quiet residential hamlet     
whose inhabitants once depended on     
farming &amp; seldom left the hamlet.Life  
has changed since the 1960s.           
Mechanisation of agriculture caused    
workers to seek work in towns.More     
families own cars.Cottages have been   
repaired to make homes for commuters.  
There are no amenities in Bury Green   
since the public house was burnt down  
&amp; turned into a house.There is no bus  
service,post office,shop,school or     
church. Inhabitants are therefore      
dependent on cars.
