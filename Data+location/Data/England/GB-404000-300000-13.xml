		<title>13Shopping Survey (Aldridge)</title>
		<content> We conducted a shopping survey with   
 the help of parents at our school. 178
 families replied. We found that many  
 families shopped 3 times a week. The  
 results of the question, "How do you  
 travel to the shops?" were surprising.
 10 went by bus, 64 walked and 123 went
 by car. We decided that car parks were
 good in the village and mothers       
 preferred to put their heavy groceries
 straight into the car. Only 7 people  
 travelled further than 3 miles into   
 Aldridge, 28 lived between 2 and 3    
 miles away while 143 lived 1 mile or  
 under from the shopping precinct. Over
 two thirds of the people asked shopped
 in Aldridge mainly for food. 163      
 families chose to shop in Aldridge    
 because it was convenient to get to,  
 only 1 person thought Aldridge was a  
 cheap place to shop. Most went outside
 the area to buy furniture and clothes.</content>
