		<content> St.Matthias,the parish church of      
 Ilsham in Babbacombe Road,was built as
 a chapel of ease to St.Marks Church at
 Torwood in 1858.In 1880 it became a   
 separate parish.St.Marks Church has   
 now been bought by the Torbay Operatic
 and Amatuer Dramatic Society and is   
 being changed into a theatre.Holy     
 Trinity is now a sports centre and    
 St.Matthias is now known as           
 St.Matthias,St.Marks and Holy Trinity.
 St.Matthias has never had a graveyard 
 and a new hall is being built in the  
 grounds.The windows are decorated with
 stained glass pictures including one  
 of St.Francis of Assissi in the       
 small,dark side chapel.The seats and  
 lectern are nicely carved.There are   
 three alters in the church,one big one
 and two small ones.One rector looks   
 after all three parishes.
