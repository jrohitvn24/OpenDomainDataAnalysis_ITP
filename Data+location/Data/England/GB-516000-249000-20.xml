		<content>   SANDY WAS MENTIONED IN THE ORIGINAL 
 DOMESDAY BOOK BEING SPELT SANDEIE.WHEN
 COLLECTING INFORMATION FOR THE        
 DOMESDAY PROJECT WE DISCOVERED THAT   
 MANY OF THE STREET NAMES REFLECT      
 SANDY'S HISTORY.                      
   OVER THE YEARS LIFE HAS OBVIOUSLY   
 CHANGED IN SANDY.THE SIZE OF THE TOWN 
 HAS INCREASED WITH THE MODERN HOUSING 
 ESTATES,AND THE AREA OF LIGHT         
 INDUSTIES IN SUNDERLAND ROAD.HOWEVER  
 THE FRIENDLINESS OF THE INHABITANTS OF
 SANDY REMAINS THE SAME.               
   THE CHILDREN OF ST.SWITHUN'S LOWER  
 SCHOOL WISH TO THANK THE PEOPLE OF    
 SANDY FOR THEIR PATIENCE AND HELP IN  
 OUR INVESTIGATIONS FOR THE PROJECT.
