		<title>09FARMING</title>
		<content> Although we did not pass any farms we 
 were able to find something about the 
 farmsers by looking at the fields. The
 first field we passed was an open     
 pasture which would have been used for
 cattle. The next two fields that we   
 saw were full of Barley.Although the  
 Barley fields were not very ripe the  
 Wheat fields were almost ready. Along 
 the side of the pasture fields there  
 were animal feeders although there    
 were no animals in the fields at the  
 time. Cereal crops were more common   
 than cattle.
