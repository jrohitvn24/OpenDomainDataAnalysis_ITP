		<content> A{bypass}around{Lincoln}was decided on
 and many routes were suggested. After 
 exhibitions and debates involving the 
 public who would be affected by the   
 road, it was decided the bypass should
 run from the A15 (Riseholme), via the 
 West Common and Birchwood ,to meet the
 A46, just below Thorpe_on_the_Hill.   
  Part of the bypass is already open,  
 and the road near Thorpe_on_the_Hill  
 is due to be opened in late Summer of 
 1986.{
