		<title>17COOMBE FARM NR. BRIGHSTONE</title>
		<content>  This farm has 150 acres of which 80  
 acres are ploughed.The rest is used   
 for grazing as it is either too steep 
 for the tractor or else dry and of    
 poor quality.                         
  Coombe farm is a mixed farm.Pigs are 
 the chief concern, the farmer has 750 
 altogether which he breeds and fattens
 for slaughter in Newport. He also     
 keeps some beef cattle.               
  The main crop grown here is barley.  
 This is then milled at the farm and   
 fed to the pigs. Even this is not     
 enough and more has to be bought in.  
  Two other men help on the farm and   
 the farmer's wife does office work and
 answers the telephone. The day starts 
 at 7.00am with feeding time. The      
 farmer said this was the worst job in 
 winter as he often had to break the   
 ice on their troughs and deal with    
 frozen pipes.He loves farming usually.</content>
