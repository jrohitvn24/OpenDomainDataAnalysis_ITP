		<content>      There are at present 2 churches  
 in Polperro,1 is C of E and the other 
 Methodist. There were many factions of
 the Methodist faith in the  past and  
 there are about 10 building that were 
 used for worship in the village and   
 surrounding area.Predominately a      
 Methodist community for many years    
 anything 'different' was quite        
 distinctive-hence 'THE JEWS HOUSE' in 
 Lansallos St.,Probably dating back to 
 the 18th Century. The timbers of      
 St Johns,the C of E church,were found 
 to be dangerously rotten in 1985 and  
 were completely replaced by local     
 tradesmen,financed by local donations.
