 In Autumn 1984 a{Bronze Age}body was  
 found in some peat workings on Lindow 
 Moss.He was nicknamed Lindow  Pete.   
  His elbow was damaged and his left   
 ear was bent.He was lying on his side 
 and only the upper part of his body   
 was found.                            
  His nails were manicured which shows 
 that he was not involved in heavy     
 work.He had a ginger beard and        
 moustache.They say he had fox fur     
 round his arm but otherwise he was    
 naked.When they turned him over they  
 found the garrotte.He was hit on the  
 head at least twice then garrotted,   
 after that his throat was slit with a 
 knife.He is believed to have been     
 a{human sacrifice.}They say his last  
 meal was bread.                       
  The body will be exhibited in the    
{British Museum}from 1986.             </content>
