		<content>Crops grown in 1985 in the Penkridge   
area depend a great deal on the size   
of the farm. The smaller holdings (up  
to 50 acres) are usually dairy farms   
and they therefore grow grass for      
silage for winter feed, hay and        
provide summer grazing for cattle. The 
larger units have a 4 year rotation    
of crops, this helps to prevent a      
build up of disease in the soil. The   
local crops are Oilseed Rape, Winter   
wheat (grown either for milling or     
next years seed), Barley (for cattle   
feed or malting) and Potatoes (usually 
second earlies). A few specialist      
crops are also grown such as sugarbeet 
for seed (although Penkridge is a long 
way from the factories), daffodils for 
the bulbs, strawberries for self-      
picking and sometimes Peas which are   
dried for human consumption or put     
into cattle feed.                      </content>
