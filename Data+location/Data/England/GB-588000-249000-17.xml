		<title>17A day in Gemma's life,aged 7</title>
		<content>On Monday I get up at 8 o'clock,get    
dressed and go downstairs.I just have a
drink of lemon juice for breakfast.    
Mummy makes my packed lunch and I make 
my drink ready for school.I go to      
school on a mini-bus.It takes half an  
hour and we pick up some other children
on the way.At school I put my bag on my
peg and go into class.Mrs.Lawson calls 
the register.We do our work and then go
into Assembly,where we listen to a     
story and sing a song.                 
At dinner time, hot-dinners go first   
then packed lunches go in.I have some  
sandwiches, crisps and a chocolate     
biscuit.After listening to a story,at  
half past 3,I get on the bus and go    
home with my friends.I change and go   
horse-riding. Then I have tea and go   
to bed at 8 o'clock.
