		<title>04"Bowcombe"-Cheverton Farm 2.</title>
		<content>   Like other farms in the area; a farm
 at this  place is mentioned in the    
 original{Domesday Book.}Indeed the    
 present owner has a detailed family   
 tree of the Chiverton family going    
 back to 1616 when the first farm of   
 this name was built. Interestingly; in
 1657 the then owner Richard Chiverton 
 was Lord Mayor of London, was Knighted
 by Cromwell, and later again by       
 Charles II.                           
   Unlike other farms in the area, but 
 reflecting a growing response from    
 farmers to the special problems of    
 agriculture in the late twentieth     
 century; the farm itself, now managed 
 by the owner's son, is only one of the
 enterprises of its owner.{From part of
{the farm he quarries and sells chalk  
{and shingle, and on an adjacent site  
{outside the area he operates a holiday
{camp and caravan site.                </content>
