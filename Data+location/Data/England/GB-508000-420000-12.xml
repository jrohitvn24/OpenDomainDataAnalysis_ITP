		<title>12GOXHILL YOUTH CENTRE.</title>
		<content> The Youth Centre is in the old school 
 building which was built as a Wesleyan
 Day School in 1855. The school was in 
 use until 1976 when the new school was
 opened. Since then the field and part 
 of the playground have been sold and  
 had residential properties built upon 
 them. The school and the adjoining    
 school house were empty until it was  
 decided that they should become the   
 home of the Youth Centre. The building
 was decorated by a band of volunteers.
 The Youth Club meets each Monday and  
 Wednesday from 6 to 9 p.m.; Brownies  
 on Tuesdays from 5.30 to 6.45 followed
 by Guides until 8 p.m. On Thursdays   
 the Cubs meet from 6.30 to 8 p.m. and 
 the Scouts use the premises on        
 Fridays. Discos are held on some      
 Saturday evenings. The Centre has dart
 boards, snooker and table tennis      
 tables and two electronic games.      </content>
