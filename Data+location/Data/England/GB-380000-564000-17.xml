		<title>17HIGH LIPWOOD, HAYDON BRIDGE</title>
		<content> The buildings here are interesting.   
 The largest was converted from a      
{grange}in 1973. It retains its{hemmel 
 arches as an interesting feature of   
 the dining room, &amp; on the first floor 
 old beams cross the corridor.A dovecot
 in the garden is still used by white  
 doves and the slits in its wall still 
 ventilate the building. Col. &amp; Mrs.   
 Nicholl own the house. The Col. was in
 the Rifle Brigade &amp; served in N.Africa
 &amp; Italy during the War. He was also   
{High Sherriff of Northumberland,}&amp; as 
 such was in charge of{Assize Court    
 arrangements in{Newcastle.High Lipwood
 cottage still has a flagged roof. Its 
 owner, Mrs.Eaves,has traced its       
 history back to{Queen Elizabeth's     
 reign, &amp; is pursuing it back to the   
 13th.Century. Both houses have        
 sheltered cottage gardens.
