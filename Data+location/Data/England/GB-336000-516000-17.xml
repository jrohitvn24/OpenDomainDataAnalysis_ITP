		<content> THE VILLAGE OF GLENRIDDING IS A SMALL 
 PLACE IN THE LAKE LAND. THERE IS A LOT
 OF WILD LIFE INCLUDING: FOXES,        
 RABBITS, HARES, BADGERS, DEER, MINK   
 AND WEASEL. WE HAVE A LARGE AMOUNT OF 
 BIRDS INCLUDING SWANS, BUZZARDS,GOLDEN
 EAGLES,CURLEWES,ROBINS AND CROWS.FOR  
 WILD LIFE TO SURVIVE THERE HAS TO BE  
 PLENTY OF FOOD. AS WELL THERE HAS TO  
 BE TREES TO PROUNDE COVER FOR ANIMALS 
 AND BIRDS.MOST OF THE TREES GROW CLOSE
 BY TO LAKE ULLSWATER .THE LAKE TOO IS 
 WELL STOCKED WITH FISH, MANY OF WHICH 
 ARE TROUT. MUCH OF OUR AREA IS HIGH   
 MOUNTAIN WHICH IS POPULAR WITH        
 WALKERS. MUCH OF THE NATURAL LAND     
 COVER IS GRASS OR HEATHER, WITH A HIGH
 AMOUNT OF BRACKEN WHICH GROWS IN THE  
 LATTER HALF OF THE YEAR.  THE WEATHER 
 IN OUR AREA IS EXTREMELY VARIABLE     
 BECAUSE OF THE INFLUENCE OF THE       
 MOUNTAINS.                            </content>
