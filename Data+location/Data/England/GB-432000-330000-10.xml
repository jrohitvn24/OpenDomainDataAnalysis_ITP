		<title>10A VISIT TO THE FARM</title>
		<content> The farm was built in 1954 and it only
 had 3 buildings then.Les Goodwin was  
 the owner then and still is today,when
 he is helped by Ray Allsopp.The farm  
 is poultry and arable land.They have  
 two different kinds of animals        
 chickens and pigs.There are 70,000    
 chickens and 6 pigs.The chickens and  
 pigs are sent to a factory to be      
 killed.The chickens are killed when   
 they are 7 weeks old.Aswell as the    
 livestock,they grow crops like wheat, 
 barley and rape. Les Goodwin looks    
 after the crops and Ray Allsopp the   
 animals.                              
  They have 3 new machines which are a 
 corn dryer, a tractor and a machine   
 which catches chickens.There are 5    
 sheds full of chickens and a shed full
 of pigs.Les Goodwin lives on the farm 
 and Ray Allsopp lives down the road.
