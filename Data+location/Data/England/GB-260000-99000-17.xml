		<title>17Mobile shops Exbourne &amp; S.C.</title>
		<content> Milk is delivered Mondays,Wednesdays  
 and Fridays.Any other milk required   
 has to be fetched from the village    
 shop/Post Office.                     
 The baker delivers once a week.       
 A fishmonger also delivers fresh fish 
 once a week.                          
 The Post office owners will deliver   
 groceries,in an emergency,but not     
 usually.                              
 However,in both villages,people agreed
 that a friend or neighbour going into 
 Okehampton,or Exeter,will fetch       
 things unobtainable in the village.   
 Despite the rising costs,the mobile   
 shops do provide a vital service in   
 rural communities,as do the Post      
 offices/general stores.However there  
 is no way they can be competative with
 the supermarkets in town.They must be 
 used by the local consumers to survive
 and without them-the village dies.    </content>
