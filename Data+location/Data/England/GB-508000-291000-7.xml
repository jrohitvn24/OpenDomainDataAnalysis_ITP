 school hall on Wednesdays at 6.00 and

 with six girls in each.I'm a leader or
 sixer of a group called Pixies.We have
 a badge book we can work at to gain   
 badges.Two ladies called Brown Owl and
 Tawny Owl look after the groups.One of
 the ladies comes from Elton,the other 
 from Water Newton.During the evening  
 we may go for a walk,play games,work  
 for a badge or go on a treasure-hunt. 
 We always finish with a prayer.The    
 Brownies pay 25p.for the evening.Girls
