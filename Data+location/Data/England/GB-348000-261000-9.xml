		<title>09THE BELLS APPEAL OF EYE CH.</title>
		<content> In{Eye Church}there are six bells but 
 they needed to be tuned and the beams 
 that were holding them up were        
 rotting.So in September 1984{John     
{Taylor &amp; Co}had a look and they said  
 the estimated cost of getting them    
 repaired was Â£7,000 Taylor &amp; Co. were 
{Bell Makers}from Loughborough.In Oct. 
 1984 the ceiling in the church was    
 opened so the bells could come down,  
 soon the bells were taken to the      
 foundry to be tuned.Not only were they
 tuned but complete new fittings were  
 made for them.While the bells were    
 being tuned a lot of work was being   
 put into the church,the old rotting   
 beams were replaced by metal ones.All 
 the work that was carried out on the  
 refitting was done voluntarily under  
 the guidance of{Mr.Harold Fitter}and  
{Mr.Leslie Evans}.In March 1985 the    
 bells were ready to be collected.     </content>
