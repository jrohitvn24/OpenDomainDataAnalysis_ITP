		<content> V. K. Mouldings make fibre glass      
 products. They manufacture surfboards,
 water tanks, company signs and window 
 frames. Seven people are employed     
 there altogether, three full time and 
 two part time with two partners.      
    The surfboards were the most       
 interesting products, these are sold  
 to a North Devon firm ,'Tiki', and up 
 to twelve are made each week. There   
 are ten stages in the manufacturing   
 process and these were all explained  
 to the children who visited.          
    Raw materials come from GRP        
 Bristol. The business was started     
 seven years ago in Uffculme and they  
 receive some local orders. The company
 is planning to expand next year. This 
 will involve them moving to Cullompton
 as the present premises are too small.
 They will then instal a cold press    
 moulder. Sixty different items made.  </content>
