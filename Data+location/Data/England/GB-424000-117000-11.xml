		<content>  We then drove home and dropped my    
 friend off.A car is a thing which has 
 four wheels which goes round and      
 round.The seats are called"UPHOLSTRY",
 which are usually soft. The car is    
 made from metal and the seats are made
 from plastic. My friend let me borrow 
 another computer manual. I read it    
 till teatime, at 17:45. The tea       
 contained: Rolls tea from tea bags and
 cake-sponge.                          
  I went to bed at 20:45, I washed with
 a flannel and towel. I cleaned my     
 teeth with a toothbrush made from     
 plastic. I knelt down and prayed. I   
 hummed songs until my brother said "BE
 QUIET!".I ignored him at first, but   
 the second time I didn't ignore him.  
 I eventually fell asleep at 22:00.    
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
