         ONE OF OUR FAMILIES.          
    Our family consists of myself, my  
 husband, our two daughters aged 9 and 
 6 and my Mother-in-Law. We are what I 
 think would be called a middle class  
 family. We live in a detached house in
 a small village of approximately 250  
 inhabitants called Kenardington near  
 Ashford in Kent.                      
    Our house is an old beamed house,  
 part of it dating back to the 16th.   
 century. It used to be two cottages   
 but approximately thirty years ago it 
 was converted into a single dwelling. 
 We have lived here now for eight      
 years. We have three bedrooms         
 upstairs, a lounge with an open       
 inglenook fireplace and a sitting room
 also with with an inglenook fireplace 
 downstairs.
