		<content> Most of the older houses are built    
 from coursed stone with stone flagged 
 roofs. Often they have mullion windows
 and many weavers cottages have a row  
 of mullion windows upstairs to let    
 in the maximum light. Most recent     
 houses are built of random stone and  
 they have bigger windows,and the roofs
 are slate or concrete tiles. Few      
 houses are built of other materials.  
 Terraced houses are the most common in
 the hamlets of Victoria,Jackson Bridge
 and Barnside and also on Lee Terrace  
 in Scholes. Often the houses in this  
 area have more than two storeys being 
 built into the hillside with one      
 dwelling above and one below.Hepworth 
 has many traditional older houses     
 typical of our area,but there are new 
 houses and bungalows on the outskirts.
 Nearly all the houses are private,but 
 Hepworth has a small council estate.  </content>
