		<content> Many people come to Eastbourne to     
 learn the English language.  There are
 classes throughout the year, but      
 especially in the summer.             
 Students come from many countries     
 including Europe, the Middle East,    
 China and South America. The students 
 spend their morning in school from    
 about 9:15-12:00 a.m. and they spend  
 most of their afternoons sight seeing.
  They stay as paying guests with local
 families. There are about a dozen     
 language schools in Eastbourne.  The  
 most popular are the Language Tuition 
 Centre and European Friends.  Students
 also travel on outings to learn about 
 English culture.  A two week course   
 costs about Â£100.
