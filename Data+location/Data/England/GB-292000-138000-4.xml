		<title>04Sheep at North Hawkwell Farm</title>
		<content> Mr. Schofield has 550 ewes and 700    
 lambs. He has two different kinds of  
 sheep they are a Cheviot cross sheep  
 and Suffolk sheep.                    
                                       
 Mr. Schofield can fit a hundred and   
 sixty sheep in his shed for lambing.  
 He puts the sheep in the shed six     
 weeks before lambing in March.        
                                       
 In the sheep handling shed he shears  
 the sheep and weighs the lambs and    
 drenches them. He has two shearing    
 motors and two drenches and one sheep 
 weighing machine. When they have      
 sheared a sheep they tie the wool up  
 with string. Mr Schofield does not    
 shear his lambs and he sells his sheep
 wool at South Molton.                 
                                       
 In November he sells his lambs at     
 Cutcombe Market.                      </content>
