		<content> Life in an Old People's Home is       
 different. At{Wilfred Geere House}the 
 nurses have to work very hard to      
 prevent accidents because many of the 
 35 residents(7 men &amp; 28 women) need a 
 lot of attention; 8 are in wheelchairs
 7 can only walk with a Zimmer frame, 4
 are blind and l7 are incontinent. 10  
 are over 90 years old. The oldest is a
 lady of 98 and the youngest is a man  
 of 72. There are l7 bedrooms(6 single)
 so most people have to share a room.  
 For most of the day the old people sit
 and talk or watch TV in one of the    
 lounges. In the evenings they play    
 bingo or dominoes. On Wednesdays there
 is a handicrafts class &amp; Saturday is  
 sports day on TV which the men enjoy. 
 There is a very long waiting list and 
 the only way to get a place at the    
 home is if someone dies.
