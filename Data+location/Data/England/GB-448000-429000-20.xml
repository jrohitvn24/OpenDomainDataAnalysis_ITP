		<title>20SPORTS AFTERNOON</title>
		<content>  On{sports afternoon}I was captain    
 wearing two green bands. There were   
 quite a few races,{beanbag, skipping, 
{obstacle,  sack}and{running.}I entered
 for running sack and obstacle, I came 
 first in obstacle and second in       
{running}and sack. Our team won the    
 team shield  so it will get another   
 green ribbon on it.The green team has 
 wont 2 years{running }while I have    
 been at this school.My favourate race 
 is the obstacle.First you had to run  
 with the{egg and spoon,}throw the     
 away,dribble a{ball}to a{shinty       
 stick.Use the{shinty stick}to hit the 
 ball to the next obstacle.Go through 3
 sets of hoops which get smaller each  
 time,then run to the finishing line.
