		<title>12Churches in Hollington</title>
		<content>{Hollington Church in the Wood}is one  
 of the oldest churches in this area,  
 dating back to Saxon times. It is     
 right in the middle of woodland; and  
 is a very attractive little church in 
 lovely surroundings. There is room for
 about 60 people inside. Many people   
 use the wood for walking and playing. 
 Children take their B.M.X. bikes      
 (sturdy bikes used for trick cycling) 
 onto a rough track here. Recently     
 Churchwood School, Tesco Stores and   
 housing areas were built nearby, so it
 is not so rural now.                  
{St.John's}Church is much larger and   
 in the centre of the housing. Our     
 school uses this church for its       
 Christmas Carol Concert. In           
 Hollington there is also a{Methodist  
 Chapel, and a{Roman Catholic Church.  
 Both these are well attended.
