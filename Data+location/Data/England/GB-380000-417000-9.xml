		<content> As the Rossendale Way runs through    
 Turn Village providing many           
 alternative walks, it is of major     
 interest to hikers.Along the Way there
 is a Turnpike on Walley  Road,        
 established in 1801.Bury Old Road,    
 running from Bury to Rawtenstall is an
 ancient highway, which can still be   
 traced from Bury to Rawstenstall and  
 which was in use up to the beginning  
 of the 19th century,                  
     For those who fancy a drink the   
 white "Plane Tree Inn"provides a      
 friendly service in a relaxed         
 atmosphere.It provides bar snacks and 
 meals, and in the summer months       
 afternoon teas are also available in  
 the bear garden.
