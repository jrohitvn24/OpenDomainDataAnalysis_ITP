  Ours is predominantly a {Farming}    
 parish,with most people engaged in    
 farming,foresty,horticulture,the      
 professions and service industries.The
 countryside is rolling and well       
 watered  with fields and woods.Our    
 district is famous for its {Timber    
{Framed Architecture},and there are    
 many cider apple orchards -mostly     
 grown for Bulmers or a small local    
 cider firm,just outside Pembridge.    
   Although there is a very strong     
 feeling for local traditions,the      
 people here are very                  
 enterprizing,intelligent and          
 freindly.There is a strong element of 
 help-your-neighbours,you-may-need-his-
 help-one-day,and many transactions are
 based on reciprocal services,on barter</content>
