		<content> As can be seen from the aerial        
 photograph, the landscape could be    
 termed as rolling. The slope mainly   
 running from north west to south east,
 with the hills at Orcop and at        
 Bryngwyn hill above Wormelow forming  
 another ridge. Nearly all the fields  
 are hedged, some with ditches.The     
 Poole Spring pond being the           
 largest area of water.The             
 Wrigglesbrook drains the north side of
 the block. The area is predominately  
 arable and pasture with some wooded   
 areas. Roads disect the area the main 
 ones being the A49 Hereford-Ross and  
 A466 Hereford-Monmouth roads. There   
 are a number of green lanes in the    
 area but some of these are becoming   
 overgrown due to lack of use.
