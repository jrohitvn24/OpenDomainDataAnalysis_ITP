		<title>06ST.MATTHEWS CHURCH N.WALTHAM</title>
		<content>   As{New Waltham}got bigger and more  
 people came to live here, people      
 thought that the village needed its   
 own church.The nearest churches where 
 in Waltham and Humberston.            
   The villagers and helpers built the 
 church themselves because they        
 couldn't afford to have one built.They
 made every block and carried them the 
 three miles from Waltham.They started 
 in 1933 and finished in May 1934      
 calling it the' mission hall.'        
   In September 1984 a new church,now  
 called{St.Matthews}was started because
 the old one had become dangerous.It   
 will be opened in September 1985.It   
 will hold 185 people.The old church   
 walls will be knocked down to one     
 metre in height and made into a garden
 so that noboby will forget the hard   
 work which went into building the old 
 mission hall in 1933.                 </content>
