		<title>11BROXBOURNE/BRICKENDON ROADS</title>
		<content> Opened in l973, the Al0 road was built
 to relieve the old road through the   
 Broxbourne district and is part of the
 main London/Cambridge route. It has   
 been skilfully screened by trees and  
 banks &amp; a tunnel has been provided for
 badgers - rather apt as the derivation
 of Broxbourne is "badger's stream" or 
 possibly "stream of a man named Brocc"
 Originally made of cement the north-  
 bound carriageway has now been        
 resurfaced with tarmac &amp; the south-   
 bound is due to be repaired as soon as
 finance is available. Roads to the    
 west of the Al0, across to Brickendon,
 are in reasonable condition although  
 narrow &amp; mostly kerbless. They are    
 well used during some parts of the day
 &amp; at weekends horse riders add to the 
 traffic. There is an interchange at   
 Hoddesdon for access to the town and  
 district.                             </content>
