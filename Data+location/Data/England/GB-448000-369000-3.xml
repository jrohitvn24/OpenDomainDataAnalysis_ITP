		<title>03WHALEY MOOR FARM.</title>
		<content>      Mr Brocksop began farming at     
 Whaley Moor Farm in 1949, in          
 partnership with his brother. He is a 
{tenant}of the Chatsworth Estate. After
 twelve years his bother took another  
 farm and Mr Brocksop continued at     
 Whaley Moor.                          
      The farm extends to{380 acres}and
 is used for both{stock}and arable     
 farming. Crops grown include{wheat,   
{barley}and{potatoes.}The cattle are   
{British Friesians,}bought at three    
 months old and fattened for beef.     
      A number of changes have occurred
 since Mr Brocksop came to Whaley Moor.
 The farm has become highly mechanised 
 and four men now do the work that once
 would have taken 15 to 18 men.        
 Building changes include the          
 demolition of 66% of the farm         
 buildings to be replaced by an open   
 span cattle yard and a new farmhouse. </content>
