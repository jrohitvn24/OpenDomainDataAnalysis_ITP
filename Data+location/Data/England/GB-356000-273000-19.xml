		<title>19WHITTON COURT _ WHITTON</title>
		<content>   { Whitton Court}is an attractive    
 house, which dates from around 980.   
 Today, it gives the impression of a   
 typical{Elizabethan House.}It is a    
 grade one listed building, and it can 
 not be altered or decorated without   
 permission. Inside, there are         
 beautiful oak panels and beams, which 
 are in very good condition. There are 
 also many priceless carpets and       
 antiques. Surrounding the house there 
 are lawns, gardens and a large pond   
 with a fountain. The house used to be 
 open to the public, but now, the      
 present owners want to keep it as a   
 private residence.                    
     However, they have plans to turn  
 the stables into{an Old People's Home.
 There will be 22 bedrooms, 5          
 bathrooms, a dining room, a lounge and
 a matron to look after them.
