    The area covered by our grid       
reference 06360282 and the surrounding 
area, is purely agricultural. It has   
several farms dotted around the area   
and a very few small housing           
developments.                          
    The main A144 Bungay to Halesworth 
road passes through the middle of the  
grid. It is called Stone Street and was
once a Roman road.                     
   "The Huntsman and Hounds public     
house, once known as the "Chequers", is
sited on the main A144 road and is a   
popular eating and drinking place for  
locals and travellers.                 
    Ilketshall St. Lawrence Primary    
School is also sited within the grid   
area.It has been in use since 1878 and 
presently caters for 65 children from  
5 to 9 years old.
