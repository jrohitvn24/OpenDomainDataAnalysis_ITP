		<content>  As a holiday resort amusement arcades
 are an important feature of the town, 
 especially in the area nearest the    
 sea.There are 2 main areas of outdoor 
 amusements and these largely take the 
 form of rides e.g. inflated castle,   
 ghost train swings,waltzers,kiddies   
 train.Most are small-scale,simple and 
 dated.There are also separate areas   
 for crazy golf and remote control     
 boats.                                
  The 3 indoor amusement arcades have  
 been considerably developed and       
 modernised,although many of the       
 facilities are traditional with bingo,
 fruit machines and video games the    
 most popular.One centre has tried to  
 go up-market with bar and restaurant. 
  Despite the apparently large number  
 of separate arcades the amusements,   
 both indoor and outdoor,are largely in
 the hands of 2 local businessmen.     </content>
