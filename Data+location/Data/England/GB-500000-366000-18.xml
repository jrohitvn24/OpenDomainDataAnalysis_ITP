		<title>18BRANSTON'S LANDSCAPE</title>
		<content> Branston is fairly low lying. To the  
 west the land rises to about 60m above
 sea level because most of the land    
 towards the east descends to 24m above
 sea level because most of the land    
 towards the East is very low and used 
 to marshy fen land. Drainage has made 
 it into good farmland. In Branston    
 itself there are a lot of residential 
 buildings but further out most of the 
 buildings are for farming purposes.   
 Most of the land is wide open fields  
 and used for growing crops like wheat 
 and barley. There are not many trees  
 and there are no forests, rivers or   
 big streams. The average rainfall per 
 month is 50mm. Temperatures range from
 an average of 3 degrees c. in January 
 to 20 degrees c. in June, July and    
 August. June is usually the sunniest  
 month.                                
                                       </content>
