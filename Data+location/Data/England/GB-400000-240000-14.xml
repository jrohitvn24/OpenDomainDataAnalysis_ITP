		<content> MARKET GARDENING                      
    The land in this area is classified
 as having the best soil in Britain and
 it is therefore very intensively used.
 Instead of big fields with hedgerows  
 here we have many smallholdings.      
    Instead of talking about farmers   
 and their farms we refer to growers   
 and their ground. All types of fresh  
 vegetables are grown as you can see on
 photo C.                              
    We have a lot of glasshouses and   
 polythene tunnels and most growers use
 irrigation sprays and lots of         
 fertilisers. This does spoil the      
 landscape as there are many sheds and 
 hardly any trees or hedgerows. Some of
 the orchards have been grubbed out    
 because cheaper fruit is coming from  
 Europe.
