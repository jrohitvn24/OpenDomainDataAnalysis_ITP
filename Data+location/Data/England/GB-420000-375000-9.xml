		<title>09LOCAL HISTORY.50 YEARS AGO.</title>
		<content> Fifty years ago,in 1935,there were    
 three factories which made children's 
 slippers,but today they are not       
 working.                              
 Eyam in the early days had no Village 
 Club,well-dressings or carnival.There 
 was a sheep roast and a Mechanics     
 Institute.Around 1935 there were very 
 few buses that came through the       
 village but there was a railway at    
 Grindleford.In the 1930's there was no
 television.There was the wireless     
 which needed headphones in order to   
 listen to London.                     
 From 1935 to 1985 Eyam has not changed
 a great deal.Those who have lived in  
 the area all their lives find it a    
 most interesting village.In 1935 the  
 Rose and Crown Public House was a     
 school.
