		<title>11BOLTON SAILING CLUB</title>
		<content> The Bolton Sailing Club uses the      
 northern part of the Belmont          
 Reservoir as the Waterhead section of 
 their racing circuit. Founded in 1951,
 with a current membership of 400, they
 race each Sunday from end March to    
 beginning December, and also on       
 Wednesday evenings from mid-April to  
 end August.  They sail Merlin Rockets,
 GP14s, Larks and with Cadets for the  
 under 18-year olds.  There is also a  
 Handicap fleet to cover any other     
 class of boat.  The reservoir is 90   
 feet at the deepest part, but during  
 1984, it was 22 feet below normal     
 levels, and the racing circuit was    
 severely curtailed.  This has not been
 a problem during 1985 which has been  
 an exceptionally wet summer.  The     
 average rainfall for this area is 55  
 inches, the amount required for the   
 formation of peat.                    </content>
