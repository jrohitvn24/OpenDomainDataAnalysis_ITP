		<title>06PROBLEMS : LACK OF INDUSTRY</title>
		<content> In the 1970s plans were advanced for  
 some{light industry}being developed in
 Kirkby Lonsdale but the siting in an  
 area of such beauty proved to be an   
 insurmountable problem.The{lack of    
{industrial development}has serious    
 implications for the locality as the  
{employment prospects}for many young   
 people in the immediate vicinity are  
 poor,unless they are able to work on a
 farm or in one of the many small      
 family businesses.It also means that  
 commuting by car has become a regular 
 way of life for some,and Kirkby has in
 some respects become a{dormitory town,
 serving large centres,such as Kendal  
 and Lancaster.Young people who move   
 away are completely lost to the       
 community and unless those who travel 
 outside to work can be involved in    
 their town,then the{traditional}idea  
 of a community begins to break down.  </content>
