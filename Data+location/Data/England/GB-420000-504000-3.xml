		<content> Since it is an old church,{35 vicars  
{names}are{recorded}but there have of  
 course been more vicars than that.    
                                       
 There has only been one parish church 
 in the village and the small{Methodist
{Chapel}was{closed}only very recently. 
 There used to be, in olden days, a    
 little church at{Moulton,}which is the
{neighbouring village,}and this was run
 by monks.                             
                                       
 The{present vicar}is the{Rev. Richard 
{Cooper.}He is busiest at festival     
 times such as Easter, Harvest and     
 Christmas.
