		<title>17Housing in Our Area.</title>
		<content> There are 5 areas of housing in this  
 study area; 4 are administered by     
 Rotherham and 1 by Sheffield.         
 The Shiregreen estate is part of      
 Sheffield, it is a large council      
 estate built largley in the 1930,s.   
 The houses are a mixture of types.They
 are built from greyish bricks with    
 pebbledash in some cases. Some are    
 semi_detatched, others in blocks of 3 
 or 4.Some have been modernised but    
 there appears to be very few privately
 owned. The  Blackburn estate was built
 in the postwar boom years and         
 remains largely unaltered. However    
 one street was demolished in 1968 to  
 make way for the M.1. Motorway. The   
 houses are practically all            
 semi_detached and council owned.The   
 two other areas are estates which     
 contain privately owned houses.
