		<title>01Bridgerule Today</title>
		<content> Years ago, this small village which is
 cut in two by the River Tamar, was    
 known as East and West Bridgerule -   
 the eastern half being in Devon and   
 the western half in Cornwall. Now the 
 whole village is deemed in Devonshire,
 but the Primary School keeps its old  
 title of East Bridgerule Voluntary    
 Primary School.                       
    The original site for the village  
 was at Churchtown where St.Bridget's  
 Church is situated but with the advent
 of adequate flood controls and        
 drainage,the main buildings grew up in
 the valley and now form the village.  
 The surrounding countryside is good   
 fertile farmland with fields and      
 hedges interspersed with areas of     
 copse.                                
    Bridgerule is situated in between  
 Holsworthy,Devon, and Bude,Cornwall.
