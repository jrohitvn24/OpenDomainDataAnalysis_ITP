		<content>  In{Saxon}times in Hythe was a church.
 It might have just been St. Edmunds   
 Chapel.{The Old Lympne Port}could not 
 be used because it was silting up, so 
 Hythe was formed and took over, so    
 they got a bigger church. In about    
 1289 there was a storm which flooded  
 the marsh which made the river change 
 it direction which in turn made the   
 harbour silt up. At this the town     
 suffered plague and fire so there was 
 a hold up and no more work was done on
 the church apart from making the      
 arches bigger and adding a tower and  
 porch. People often left money in     
 their wills to keep a light burning in
 front of the statues of saints. At one
 time a landslide shook the tower so   
 the bells rang, and the slide weakened
 the tower which caused it to fall, but
 soon after it was rebuilt using some  
 of the original stones.               </content>
