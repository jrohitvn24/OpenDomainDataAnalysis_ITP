		<content>   We did a survey with 30 juniors. We 
 asked them if they would like to live 
 in the country or town. 29 people said
 the country, and 1 said the town. The 
 second question was why did you choose
 that? They were: peacefulness 80%,    
 space 48%, and no traffic 36%. The    
 third question was what do you think  
 people who live in the town would like
 to do in the country? They were:      
 wildlife 62%, visiting farms 36%, and 
 picnics 36%. The fourth question was  
 what do you think you would like to do
 in the holidays in a town? The replies
 were parks 80%, shopping 70%, and     
 swimming 33%. The fifth question was  
 when and if you get married, where    
 would you like to live?  27 people    
 said the country and 3 people said the
 town.
