		<title>19A Day In My Life (2)</title>
		<content>{Saturday 15th June:}I got up at 9 a.m.
 and had some 'Start' for breakfast,   
 and then I went to{camp practice}with 
 my friend, Rebecca. We had to put up a
 tent and a toilet tent, and then we   
 had to make our bedding rack and sort 
 out the wood for other gadgets. We    
 then went home and I had a salad for  
 lunch and got ready for my            
{disco-dancing}class. At 1 p.m. I went 
 to catch the bus into town. First     
 I went to Superdrug to buy some drinks
 for school dinner next week. At 2 p.m.
 I went to the disco class for an hour 
 and then I went shopping and bought   
 some stickers at'Upstairs Downstairs'.
 Later in the afternoon I met my Mum   
 and we went to get a season ticket for
{'Waterscene'}which is a large, outdoor
 pool with lots of different           
 activities. In the evening I went to  
 my friend Jill's birthday barbeque.   </content>
