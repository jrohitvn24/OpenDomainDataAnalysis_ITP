		<content>  The cook at our school is called     
 Mrs.McCallum. She helps to prepare the
 dinners at our school. We get{a choice
{each day of different meals.}You can  
 have a main course and a sweet.There  
 are usually hot dogs or hamburgers and
 pizzas and things.I just like chips   
 but I have to take something else or I
 get wrong from the dinner lady.The    
 teacher makes sure you eat your meals 
 quietly or else you get sent out.{The 
{teachers}are not in school at dinner  
 times at the moment because they are  
 in a{dispute over pay}so we can't stay
 in school at dinner times. We get     
{packed lunches}and have to take them  
 away to eat them.I do not like the    
 sandwiches and do not care for the    
 milk shakes either.Lots of us do not  
 eat them and buy something at the     
 shops instead.{       E.Bell,aged 13
