		<title>11Montacute House.</title>
		<content>   Montacute House was built in the    
 years around 1600, at the end of Queen
 Elizabeth 1's reign, probably by      
 William Arnold, a Somerset mason from 
 near Wincanton. The work was done by  
 local masons and the stone came from  
 nearby Ham Hill.                      
   The Phelips Family who had once     
 lived in Montacute House, could no    
 longer afford to keep it in the 19th  
 century so it was let to Lord Curzon. 
   In 1931 the future of Montacute     
 looked grim and the house might have  
 been pulled down if Mr.Cook and the   
 Society for the Protection of Ancient 
 Buildings had not bought it and       
 presented it to the National Trust.   
   It is now open to the public.
