		<title>12WOODFIELD COUNTY INFANTS'.</title>
		<content> There are 225 children between five   
 and seven years old in Woodfield      
 Infants' School. It is a large        
 building with seven classrooms, a hall
 and a kitchen. The caretaker looks    
 after the building and keeps it very  
 clean. He also helps by putting up the
 P.E. apparatus, carrying the milk     
 crates and lifting furniture.         
 The cook has five helpers in the      
 kitchen. They make 200 meals a day for
 the children and there is no waste    
 because they are so good. A welfare   
 supervisor looks after each class at  
 dinner time. There are two dinner     
 sittings every day and the children   
 sit at octagonal tables. Woodfield    
 Infants' School has a Headmistress, a 
 Deputy Headmistress and 6 full time   
 teachers, 3 part time teachers and 2  
 ancillary helpers. It is a very happy 
 school.                               </content>
