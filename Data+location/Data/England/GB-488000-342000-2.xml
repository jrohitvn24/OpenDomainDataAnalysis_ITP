 When I wake up in the morning,        
 normally about 7.45 I get out of bed  
 and go downstairs for breakfast.  I   
 have a bowl of cereal and a cup of    
 tea.  I then get dressed and ready for
 school.  At 8.35 I come out and go to 
 school and we play football until     
 9.00. Then we go into school and begin
 work.                                 
                                       
 At 12.00 we wash our hands and come in
 for lunch.  I have a packed lunch of  
 sandwiches.  After lunch we have a    
 playtime until 1.00.  At 3.30 we      
 finish school for the day.  When I get
 home I go to the shop for some sweets 
 and then I watch television.          
                                       
 We have tea at 5.30 and after tea I   
 watch television until my bed time at 
 9.00.                                 </content>
