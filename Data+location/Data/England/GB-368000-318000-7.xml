		<title>07AN EDGMOND FARM WORKER</title>
		<content>  {Oswald Powell}came from North Wales 
 and moved to Edgmond because he needed
 work. At first he lived in one of 6   
 council houses in the area used by    
 farm workers. He now lives in a tied  
 house belonging to his employer. 40   
 years ago he looked after 800 sheep   
 but now he works machinery. Employment
 on the farm has dropped three-quarters
 but Ozzy thinks it is much better as  
 the jobs are done more efficiently and
 quickly. He thinks{recreation}in      
 Edgmond is good, there are lots of    
{clubs}and many activities for all     
 ages. He often goes to the pub to meet
 his friends. His wife enjoys shopping 
 in Newport every day to meet her      
 friends. Ozzy thinks that Edgmond has 
 changed for the better as it has ample
 facilities and is in easy reach of    
 larger towns but is still a pleasant  
 quiet place to live.                  </content>
