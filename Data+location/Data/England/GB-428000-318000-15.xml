		<content>{  Eureka Park}was set out in the      
 1920's. It's named after an old       
 colliery which was found here. It is  
 an early example of reclaimed derelict
 land. It provides these activities:   
{tennis courts, bowling green, gardens 
{&amp; open areas for games.}The local     
 firemen use it for their bonfire and  
 firework display on November 5th.     
   Opposite the park are{Granville Fish
{Ponds}stocked for coarse fishing with 
 roach, rudd, bream, tench, carp, perch
 &amp; pike. Conservationists are worried  
 about the lead shot, used as weights  
 by anglers which poses a threat to the
 wildfowl living on the ponds, mainly  
 the swans. The local council's draft  
 plan includes details to improve the  
 area by improving the bank to make    
 fishing safer &amp; dredging the badly    
 silted parts. Footpaths to the ponds  
 are to be improved.                   </content>
