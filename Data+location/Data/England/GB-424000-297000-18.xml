		<title>18ALLOTMENT GARDENS.</title>
		<content> Gardening is a popular pastime in the 
 area and there are several allotment  
 sites provided for use by keen        
 vegetable growers. The Baddesley Ensor
 Parish Council rents land from the    
 Dugdale Estate and relets plots on    
 three sites in the village.The Estate 
 lets allotments to individuals too.   
 Rents vary between Â£7 to Â£15 per annum
 for a plot approximately 25 metres by 
 10 metres.Most gardeners spread       
 manure,from the local farm,on the soil
 during the Autumn and then dig the    
 plot,ready for Spring planting.They   
 grow the usual vegetables and often   
 flowers,such as dahlias.              
 Several flower and vegetable shows are
 held in the area in September and     
 there is a shield awarded for the     
 'Best Allotment'each year.            
 A few allotment holders keep poultry, 
 and one man rears pigs on two plots.  </content>
