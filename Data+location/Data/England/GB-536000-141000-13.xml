		<title>13RELIGION IN LINGFIELD</title>
		<content> The imposing parish church of St.     
 Peter and St. Paul is in Lingfield Old
 Town. Although not mentioned in the   
 Domesday Book, it is thought to date  
 from the 11th century. Its unusually  
 large size, together with its fine    
 brasses and tomb sculpture, point to a
 prosperous history. Although          
 physically secluded, the church plays 
 a lively part in the Christian        
 community's activities, under the     
 guidance of the vicar, Mr Ramsay.     
    A short distance away is the       
 30-year old Catholic church of St.    
 Bernard, whose priest is Father       
 Charlton. The only other church is the
 Mormon Temple at Newchaple. Members of
 other denominations must travel to    
 Dormansland or East Grinstead to      
 worship.
