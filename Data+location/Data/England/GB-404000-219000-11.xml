		<title>11TRANSPORT IN SALPERTON AREA</title>
		<content>    The nearest railway stations are at
 Cheltenham (6 miles) and Kingham (14  
 miles).There are no bus services      
 connecting with trains.Most people    
 living in the area have to walk up to 
 a mile to reach the nearest bus route 
 in order to get to Cheltenham for work
 or shopping.The bus services are      
 privately owned but subsidised.       
 Most households own private cars.In   
 Salperton only two elderly pensioners 
 have no car and they depend on friends
 for lifts into Cheltenham.The nearest 
 petrol pump is 6 miles away.          
 There are special school buses which  
 take children to the primary school in
 Andoversford,secondary schools in     
 Cheltenham, and Westwoods Grammar     
 School in Northleach.
