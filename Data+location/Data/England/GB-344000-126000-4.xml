		<content> There has been a lot of new property  
 built during the last 20 years and    
 this has brought a large number of    
 people into the village.There are a   
 large number of 'professional' people:
 school teachers,doctors and dentists. 
      There are 10 farmers whose       
 fields surround the village.There was 
 a Post Office until about 8 years ago 
 when the post_mistress died.Now most  
 villagers go to Langport to collect   
 their pensions and allowances.Now that
 the school has closed down primary    
 aged children travel to High Ham and  
 St Gilda's Convent in Langport,while  
 the older children attend Huish       
 Episcopi Comprehensive.There are no   
 shops or bus service so that a car is 
 very neccessary to the villagers.
