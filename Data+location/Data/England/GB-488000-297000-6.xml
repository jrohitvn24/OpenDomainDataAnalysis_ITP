		<title>06Bisbrooke Village</title>
		<content>    The name of this village was       
 "Bitel's Brook" in the original       
 Domesday Survey, and this must refer  
 to the streams north and south of the 
 village which drain into the Welland. 
 There are about thirty houses in the  
 village, mostly made of local         
 limestone. There are few amenities,   
 and the camping and caravan site      
 marked on most O.S.Maps is no longer  
 operating.                            
                                       
    The inn, known as "The Gate Inn"   
 was originally built as a farmhouse,  
 but probably developed into an inn    
 when the railway came to the area.    
 Some say it used to be called "The    
 Ragged Urchin". The name was changed  
 to a more desireable one, which refers
 to the kissing gates on "Inhams", the 
 old right of way to Uppingham.
