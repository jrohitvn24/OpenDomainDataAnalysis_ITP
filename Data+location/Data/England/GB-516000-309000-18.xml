		<title>18DEEPING ST.JAMES PRIORY FARM</title>
		<content>     The farm has been in the farmer's 
 family since 1941.Since then the farm 
 has doubled in size.In 1972 the farmer
 owned 5 tractors,4 under 50 horsepower
 and 1 under 80 horsepower.Today the   
 farmer ownes 4 tractors,3 over 50 hor-
 sepower and 1 which is 135 horsepower.
 In 1972 4 workers worked full time on 
 the farm.Today the farmer and his bro-
 ther do all the work on their own with
 the help of their machinery.Even the  
 varieties of crops have changed. The  
 farmer has changed his varieties of   
 barley,wheat,peas and oil seed rape   
 for a better yield.                   
     Out of all the years he has been  
 on the farm 1984 gave him the best    
 yield because of the right weather,dry
 autumn,wet spring,and a dry harvest.  
     In 1986 the farm yard building is 
 going be converted into some houses   
 and a new grain store.                </content>
