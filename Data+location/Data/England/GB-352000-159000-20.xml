		<content> Chew Stoke Church although overall    
 dedication is to St. Andrew has a     
 unique dedication within it; the      
 South Transept recalls the legend of {
{WILGEFORTH}a daughter of a one time   
 heathen{King of Portugal.}The princess
 had been converted to Christianity and
 was very distressed when she          
 discovered that her father had plans  
 for her to marry an unbeliever:       
 wishing neither to marry him nor to   
 disobey her father she prayed to God  
 that she be disfigured and so made    
 unattractive to men. She was given a  
 beard and her suitor was so frightened
 he went away and her enraged father   
 had her beheaded, possibly because he 
 was afraid of the powers within her.  
 How part of Chew Stoke Church came to 
 be dedicated to St. Wilgeforth or the 
 "Maid Uncumber" as she is sometimes   
 known is a mystery.                   </content>
