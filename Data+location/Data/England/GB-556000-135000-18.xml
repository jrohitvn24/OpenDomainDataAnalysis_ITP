		<title>18INTERVIEW WITH OUR POLICEMAN</title>
		<content>                                       
 PC Morrison lives in Frant and he is  
 sort of a partner with PC White in    
 Eridge.He said that there aren't many 
 crimes in this area.He thinks that    
 Frant is a nice place to live in. If  
 PC White is off ill or something PC   
 Morrison might take over or the other 
 way round. He doesn't go to the police
 station he does his work at home in   
 his office and if he needs to go out  
 on pratrol he has his police car      
 parked outside his house.             
 He can wear uniform or normal clothes 
 but PC Morrison wears uniform because 
 in the daytime he can be seen if      
 somebody wants help and in the        
 nightime he can't be seen so he can   
 follow criminals without being seen.  
 Mr Morrison likes helping people in   
 his job as most policeman do.
