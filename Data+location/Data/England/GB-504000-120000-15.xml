		<title>15BOROUGH FARM AND ROMAN VILLA</title>
		<content>  Borough Farm is largely grassland    
 supporting a herd of 400 Suffolk Cross
 Mule sheep which are bred on the farm 
 and sold for meat when they are       
 between 3 and 6 months old.           
  Buildings on the farm contain        
 extensive "Pulborough" stone, probably
 quarried on the farm itself.          
  Near the farm buildings and beneath  
 grassland are the remains of a Roman  
 Villa. First discovered in 1817,this  
 was extensively excavated in 1910. The
 villa consisted of rooms and corridors
 opening off a quadrangle courtyard.   
 Remains of a hypocaust were in one    
 room; other finds included remnants of
 mosaic pavements, coins and pottery.  
  Running from N. to S. on the eastern 
 side of the farm is a bridlepath and  
 footpath which mark the line of a     
 Roman Road which linked Stane Street  
 with an E. to W. road a mile to the S.</content>
