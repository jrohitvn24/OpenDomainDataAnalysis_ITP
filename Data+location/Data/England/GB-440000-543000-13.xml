		<title>13Junction House Farm</title>
		<content> Junction House Farm is about 150 years
 old and covers 220 acres or 90        
 hectares. Mr &amp; Mrs Hutchinson and his 
 brother keep about 50 cattle to fatten
 and sell at Dartlington Mart. He has  
 Fresian, Hereford, and Aberdeen Angus 
 cattle which he buys from local       
 farmers and friends. In summer the    
 cattle feed on grass and the calves   
 have powdered milk and calf-cutlets.  
 In winter they are brought inside and 
 eat silage, hay, sugar beet and nuts. 
 A new barn is now being built for the 
 cattle in winter. In his fields he    
 grows wheat, barley, hay oil seed,    
 rape, peas and potatoes. He sells most
 of this but keeps hay, straw, and some
 barley for animal feed. There are many
 machines which Mr Hutchinson uses. To 
 prepare the land he uses a plough and 
 a power harrow. To sow seeds he has a 
 corn drill and potato planter.        </content>
