		<title>18A SATURDAY IN MAY</title>
		<content> On Saturday I wake up at 6.30am to    
 take the dog for a walk with my dad. I
 get dressed, put on the dog's collar  
 and lead and set off for a walk.      
 When I get back my mum has my         
 breakfast ready. I have Kellogs Rice  
 Crispies,toast and coffee. I have it  
 on a tray so that I can watch Popeye  
 on TVam. It finishes at 7.30am. I     
 usually play with my Lego until       
 lunchtime.                            
 After lunch I get ready to go to watch
 Leicester City play football in       
 Leicester. It finishes at about       
 5.00pm. When I get home I have my     
 dinner then I go out to play with my  
 friends until 8.30pm.                 
 When I come in I watch a video which  
 my dad gets from the video shop. At   
 10.30pm I have my supper and go to    
 bed.                                  
                                       </content>
