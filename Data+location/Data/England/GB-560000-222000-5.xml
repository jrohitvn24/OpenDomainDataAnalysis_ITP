		<title>05LOCAL HISTORY-LITTLE EASTON</title>
		<content>{Little Easton}is a small village with 
 113 houses,many of these used to      
 belong to the{Maynard}Estates.The     
 Maynards came here after the Norman   
 Conquest,the family still own alot of 
 the land.We visited Little Easton     
{Manor}which is owned by the Pedley    
 family who have a furniture business  
 in Saffron Walden.We spoke to Mr Frank
 Baker and Mr Alan Pryer who were born 
 in the village.Mr Baker used to work  
 for the Maynards at the brickworks    
 which has now closed down.The shop and
 post office have closed and Tradesmen 
 no longer call.People go outside the  
 village for shopping and entertainment
 Mr Pryer's father worked for the      
 Countess of Warrick as a carpenter,he 
 also carved the altar and choir stalls
 at the church.We visited The Stag,it  
 has been a pub for many years,it is   
 an essential community meeting place. </content>
