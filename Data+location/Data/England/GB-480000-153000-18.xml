		<title>18EMPLOYMENT IN FLEET IN 1985</title>
		<content> Although 1985 is a year of high       
{unemployment}nationally, Fleet is     
 lucky in not being over affected. In  
 June, the{Job Centre}had about 140    
 local vacancies and 805 registered    
 unemployed. The main{vacancies}were to
 be found in Nursing Care, Engineering,
 Clerical Posts and Catering.          
 Fleet's{Careers Office}opens twice a  
 week to help 16-18 year olds find     
 work. June is one of their busiest    
 months with many recent school leavers
 so their registered number of 50      
 youngsters is above yearly average.   
                                       
 The{Youth Training Scheme}offers      
 vocational paid training to this age  
 group. During 1984/85 about 59 Fleet  
 school leavers received training in   
 Clerical work Catering, Agriculture,  
 Manufacturing, Construction work or   
 the Retail Trade.                     </content>
