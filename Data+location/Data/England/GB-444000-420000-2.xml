		<title>02A Summer Weekend in 1985.</title>
		<content>  Holidays are great.Last Saturday I   
 went to my Nanna's to sleep.I went in 
 the car.Actually I sleep at Auntie    
 Maxine's and my brother Wayne sleeps  
 at Nanna's.Auntie Maxine has a little 
 girl called Nicola who is a year old. 
 We play with my Sindy and Barbie      
 dolls.I have some new clothes to put  
 on the dolls.There was a dress and a  
 skirt top with a purple blouse.When we
 had finished we had tea with Gran.    
  Next morning when I got up I watched 
 a Tom and Jerry cartoon on the T.V.   
 then I ate a Mars Bar and watched the 
 Kenny Everet Show.Little Nicola       
 started to cry so cousin Andy took her
 out of her cot.She cheered up when she
 found me in the spare bedroom with all
 of her toys.We all had scrambled eggs 
 for our breakfast.Its nice staying at 
 Auntie Maxine's.
