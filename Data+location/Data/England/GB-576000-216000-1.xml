		<content>    Our twelve square kilometres are   
 situated towards the northeast of     
 Essex, approximately halfway between  
 the towns of Braintree and Witham.    
    The area includes the small village
 of{White Notley}and parts of the      
 smaller communities of{Faukbourne}and{
{Fairstead.                            
    The countryside throughout is      
 fairly flat and the great majority of 
 the land is given over to farming with
 scattered farm buildings.             
    Only two roads of any size pass    
 through the area, the larger of these 
 (B1018) only just touching the        
 northeast corner. Other than these two
 roads all others are little more than 
 country lanes.                        
    There has been relatively little   
 housing development in recent years.
