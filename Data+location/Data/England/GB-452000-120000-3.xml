		<title>03UPHAM CHURCH ROOF</title>
		<content>    The tower roof was rebuilt in 1700 
 and again in 1881, but the beams      
 rotted and fell down this year, which 
 is 1985. The wood from the rafters    
 crumbles to dust in your hands.       
    Some workmen are rebuilding the    
 roof. They put down underfelt beneath 
 the random peg tiles. They used to use
 wooden pegs to hang the tiles on, but 
 now they use nails. They had to screw 
 the new rafters under the roof.       
    There is about Â£1000 worth of lead 
 on the new roof. Some of the old lead 
 is being replaced by zinc, because it 
 is much cheaper. The lead is used for 
 keeping the rain from getting into the
 church.The villagers had to raise     
 Â£8000 for the rebuilding of the roof. 
 Some of the old lead is being sold to 
 help with the cost.
