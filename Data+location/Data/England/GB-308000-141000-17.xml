		<content>      Many{tourists}seem to be         
 attracted to this block.   In fact on 
 a Saturday morning in July and August 
 it is often difficult to cross the    
 A.39 as it enters Williton.           
    The{tourist attractions}are        
 generally of the quiet and relaxing   
 nature.   The{coastline}is flat and   
 covered with interesting rock pools   
 and bounded by cliffs containing many 
 fossils.   The{areas of hills and     
{woods}make excellent walking or       
 picnicing country.   There is also the
 opportunity to have a ride on a steam 
 train by courtesy of the West Somerset
 Railway.                              
    There are two major{Holiday Camps }
 within this block and another large   
 permanent{Caravan Park.  }Many of the 
 farmers supplement their income by    
 either doing{Bed and Breakfast}or by  
 hiring out land for{caravans or}tents.</content>
