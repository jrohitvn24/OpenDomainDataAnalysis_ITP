		<content> He often has to attend accidents and  
 is trained in first-aid. Before coming
 to see us he had been to 2 road       
 accidents. He was annoyed by one as it
 had happened because an adult had not 
 used a patrol crossing. He felt that  
 adults should show a better example to
 children. Although he sometimes drives
 a panda car he also patrols on foot   
 and on his bike. Occasionally he has  
 to attend large events like football  
 matches for crowd control duty. During
 the miner's strike he was often away  
 from home on picket duty. When on duty
 he always carries a radio, notepad a  
 truncheon and handcuffs. We looked at 
 his truncheon and handcuffs and heard 
 messages over the radio. He told us   
 that to join the police you need 4 'A'
 levels and be 5 foot 8 tall. When he  
 joined you had to be 5 foot 11 and    
 weigh not less than 13 stone.         </content>
