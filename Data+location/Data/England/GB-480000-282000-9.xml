		<content> In {Desborough,}many years ago at the 
 back of{Loatland Street}there was a   
 railway line which used to be called  
{"Puffin' Billy".}This has all gone    
 now and the land is now covered by    
 houses. There have not been many      
 changes in Desborough but the Leisure 
 Centre has been built recently. Many  
 buildings have been knocked down and  
 a lot of old people's homes have been 
 built.                                
 14 shops have been knocked down and 4 
 have been rebuilt.Most houses are     
 built on ironstone foundations. There 
 were lots of shoe factories including 
{Cheaney's; Crampton's; Groocock's;    
{Turner's}and{Normsby's.}7 or 8 of     
 these factories have been closed. The 
 population has increased from 24,000  
 to 60,000. Lots of little shops have  
 been closed but a lot more have been  
 built.                                </content>
