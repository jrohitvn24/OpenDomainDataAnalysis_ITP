		<title>02The Geography of our Block.</title>
		<content> Thea area we surveyed is on the edge  
 of the Cotswolds in Gloucestershire.  
 The rock in our area falls into two   
 groups; one of the groups consists of 
 various sands,muds and silts. The     
 other consists of different types of  
 limestone.                            
 The area is placed in a deep wide     
 valley that shadows Uley,with mostly  
 deciduous trees growing thickly on the
 slopes of the hills.                  
 One of the well known hills is called 
 Uley Bury. One of the other well known
 hills is called Cam Long Down,which   
 looms up to the North West of Uley.   
 East of the Severn and West of the    
 Cotswolds lies Berkeley Vale which    
 is very flat and there are less trees 
 growing there than the Cotswolds.
