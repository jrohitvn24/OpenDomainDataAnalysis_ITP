		<content>{A day in the life of Mrs Stewart.     
                                       
 My friend Tracy and I intervewed      
 a local lady Mrs Stewart.She told     
 us that life is different now because 
 she has alot more responsobilities    
 and therefore feels a lot happier.    
 Mrs Stewart says there is a lot       
 more violence in the area now because 
 of poverty and unemployment.She would 
 rather live nowadays because there    
 are things that are helpful in the    
 house like washing machines and       
 vacuum cleaners.She has lived in four 
 houses altogether but prefers the one 
 she lives in now because it is a nice 
 size and has a lovely view.She likes  
 Hightown because she was born here.   
 Mrs Stewart would like to get free    
 prescription because illness is       
 expensive with three children.
