		<content> Time and place are both measured using
 the Greenwich Meridian.The Meridian   
 leaves the British Isles at Peacehaven
 and the point on the cliffs is marked 
 by an obelisk.                        
 Residents of Peacehaven raised the    
 money for the monument which was      
 originally intended to celebrate the  
 Silver Jubilee of King George V and   
 Queen Mary.It is however dedicated to 
 the memory of the king as he died     
 before its completion.                
 It is a source of pride to many of the
 older inhabitants of Peacehaven and it
 is always kept in agood state of      
 repair despite the fact that it is    
 exposed to all the gales and storms   
 that hit the coast.
