		<title>07100 Years Of Farming</title>
		<content>   The Pinguey family have farmed in   
 the village of Cumwhinton for 100     
 years. In the 1930's 3 men worked on  
 the farm, Mrs.Pinguey did the dairy   
 work and a girl delivered milk, riding
 a three-wheeled bicycle.They started  
 work at 6.30 a.m. and finished when it
 was time to go to bed. Every year the 
 stallion was brought to the farm and  
 it was kept there for one night.      
   Mrs. Pinguey worked very hard. As   
 well as doing the work in the dairy , 
 she had to wash all the clothes in a  
 dolly tub and used a poss-stick.      
   Cooking was done on an open fire ,  
 the children had to gather fire-wood  
 to keep the oven hot.Flat irons were  
 heated on the stove. At threshing     
 times a steam engine came to the farm 
 to drive the threshing machine, all   
 the men were fed, normally with large 
 helpings of"TATIE POT".               </content>
