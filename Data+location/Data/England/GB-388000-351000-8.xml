Thirty years ago the spoil tip of      
Chatterley Whitfield colliery was over 
90 metres in height. It was a conical  
shape and a train ran up the side to   
dump all the waste covering the valley.
The coal mine closed in 1976. When it  
closed the tip was grey, black, smoky, 
steep and dangerous. It was very very  
dirty. It was decided to landscape the 
tip and Whitfield valley for public    
use. To tidy up the tip they needed    
bulldozers, earthmoving equipment to   
make the tip less steep. Then they got 
grass to grow and are hoping to plant  
trees. It is now used for walking,     
playing, horse riding and fishing in   
the ponds, that were once filled with  
black water. We have been up the tip   
and found fossils and bits of coal     
that have been left over the years.
