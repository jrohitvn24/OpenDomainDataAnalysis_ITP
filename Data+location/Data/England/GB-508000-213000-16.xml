		<content>    The people who live and work in our
 area are very few and are mainly      
 farmers or farm workers.  Most people 
 commuters who work in either          
 surrounding towns or in London.  The  
 good transport links _ the M1, A5 and 
 near by railways make this an         
 attractive area.  The result has been 
 that country cottages have beenn      
 brought, modernised and extended so   
 that today they are very valuable.    
    Many of these people are wealthy,  
 the houses have land on which they    
 keep a horse and other animals an     
 example of this is Bylands which has  
 seven acres on which they keep 2 dogs,
 5 horses, guinea fowl, geese, a cow   
 and 50 ducks.
