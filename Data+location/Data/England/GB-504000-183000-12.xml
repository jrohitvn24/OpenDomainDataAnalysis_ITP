		<title>12Housing in  Uxbridge</title>
		<content> There are many types of housing in our
 area such as detatched,semi-detatched,
 terraced and council accommadation.In 
 Rockingham Parade there are houses    
 that date back to the previous        
 century,whereas in Station Road there 
 are houses that are 50 years old.There
 have also been houses built in the    
 last 5 years.Some Council houses are  
 not in very good condition,such as    
 those in Sefton Way,and they are only 
 14 years old.This is a typical        
 description of a house in our area.It 
 is semi-detatched,with a lounge,dining
 room and fitted kitchen.It has 3      
 bedrooms and bathroom with a seperate 
 W.C.There is gas central heating      
 fitted,a large garden and garage.It   
 would cost about Â£50,000.
