		<title>01Smarden West - Intro</title>
		<content> The eastern half of this block is     
 within the Smarden Parish boundary;   
 most of the remainder is in Headcorn  
 but just outside the main village     
 (excluding the railway station) and in
 the SW corner is a small part of      
 Frittenden. The western edge of       
 Smarden village is included with the  
 Parish Church, a row of council houses
 and some historic buildings. A great  
 deal of the area is farmland but      
 Marley Farm has become an industrial  
 site with a variety of light          
 industries, and near the Bell Inn is a
 small factory, once a vintage cider   
 factory but now pressing out plastic  
 parts for lawn mowers. Within the     
 Headcorn area is a large dairy depot  
 and a small airfield for private      
 planes with a flying school and       
 training and practice facilities for  
 parachute jumping.                    </content>
