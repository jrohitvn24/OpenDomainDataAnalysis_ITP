		<content> We have 37 acres of land;17 acres is  
 hay and other 20 acres is pasture.We  
 have 2 fields of hay and 5 fields of  
 pasture.This makes a total of 7 fiel- 
 ds.We have 34 milking cows,16 heifer- 
 s,1calf and 3 store cattle.We have six
 laying hens and a cockerel.We also    
 have 13 chickens for killing.         
    My Dad kills them. Mum and Grandma 
 feather them.After, we take all their 
 guts out and put them in a bucket.Then
 I have to dig a hole about 3-4 feet   
 deep and 2 foot wide and bury them.   
 In July we have about 100 day old     
 turkey chicks.We fatten them on       
 turkey grower.Before Christmas Dad    
 will gut and dress them and we will   
 sell them for Â£1 a pound.             
     We have 3 cade lambs: 2 ewes and  
 1 ram.The ram is mine and I'm going to
 sell it at the market in Oswestry.It  
 should make about Â£40.                </content>
