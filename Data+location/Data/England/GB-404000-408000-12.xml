		<title>12LISTED BUILDINGS.</title>
		<content> It is of interest to note that in such
 a small area of housing there are 18  
 listed buildings. This means that the 
 homes or remains of homes are of      
 historical interest for various       
 reasons. These buildings can only be  
 used for their original purpose and no
 external structural alterations can be
 made to them.                         
   A great number of these listed      
 buildings are now only relics, heaps  
 of stones, whose foundations only     
 remain.  But a numer of them,         
 originally farms or weavers cottages  
 built on the edge of the moorland,    
 have been renovated and brought up to 
 date inside and are of a high standard
 of accommodation.                     
   Two of the listed buildings are not 
 houses but are the overflow and       
 overflow portal of Butterley          
 Reservoir.                            </content>
