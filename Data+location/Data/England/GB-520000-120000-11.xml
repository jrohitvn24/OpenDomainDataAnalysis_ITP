		<title>11TRANSPORT.TRAFFIC IN COWFOLD</title>
		<content> Cowfold is situated at the junction of
 A272, East/West and A281,North/South. 
 Cowfold is a busy village because A272
 is one of the few cross country routes
 East/West, south of London.It is quite
 dangerous for pedestrians to cross the
 roads.It would be safer if there were 
 a pelican or zebra crossing.Massive   
 articulated lorries have trouble going
 round the roundabouts. Lorries are a  
 hazard to Cowfold.They drive over the 
 kerbs and pedestrians cannot be seen  
 from the high cabs.                   
      Many people in Cowfold think that
 some thing ought to be done about the 
 traffic:building a bypass is a popular
 suggestion.                           
      In a survey during 1 hour on one 
 Summer Friday morning, nearly 1,000   
 cars passed through Cowfold and over  
 300 lorries and vans went through the 
 village in the same period.           </content>
