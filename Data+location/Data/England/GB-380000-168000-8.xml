            The social concerns of many
 of the{Box}residents were voiced in   
 a booklet published in the mid 1970's 
 called{Box Parish:An Appraisal.}This  
 was organised by the{Parish Council   
 and 600 questionaires were sent       
 out,the majority of the residents     
 whilst having some complaints on the  
 lack of shopping facilities,felt that 
 the character of the village should be
 maintained , and that it should not   
 grow into a small town.Some concern   
 was felt , and still is, about the    
 amount of traffic that passes through 
{Box ,}making it difficult to get from 
 one side of the village to the        
 other.Unfortunatley most decisions on 
 local matters are taken at{County     
{Hall,}many miles away.
