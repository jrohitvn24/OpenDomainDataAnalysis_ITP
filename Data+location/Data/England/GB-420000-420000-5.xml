		<title>05UNEMPLOYMENT - WEST DEWSBURY</title>
		<content> There are over{4,500}unemployed people
 in the area.  This is because large   
 engineering, textile and other        
 assorted manufacturing businesses are 
 suffering from a{lack of demand}for   
 their goods, resulting in{closures and
{redundancies.} School leavers, in     
 particular, have found it difficult to
 gain employment.                      
 This situation has led to feelings of{
{frustration}and low morale especially 
 in the Ravensthorpe, Boothroyd and    
 Dewsbury Moor areas.  Unemployment    
 benefit of Â£27 per week for a single  
 person and Â£44 per week for a married 
 couple is considered pitifully low and
 many people are forced to claim{rent  
{and rate rebates.}There are more jobs 
 available in some{service industries  
 e.g. hotels, bars, cateriing, social  
 services, home helps, but most of     
 these are only temporary.             </content>
