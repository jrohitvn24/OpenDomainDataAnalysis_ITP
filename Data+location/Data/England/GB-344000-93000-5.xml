		<content> At half past ten we went out for      
 break.  I ate my Breakaway and Zoe and
 I talked.  At a quarter to eleven we  
 were called into School and Mrs Bide  
 taught us.  First we had reading until
 quarter past eleven and then we had to
 go outside and draw a tree.  I drew an
 oak.  At twelve o'clock we had dinner.
 As the weather was sunny we had our   
 dinner in the field.  I had a packet  
 of{crisps, some sandwiches and an     
{apple.}After dinner Zoe and I played  
 horses until one o'clock.             
                                       
 After break we had athletics.  Kirsty 
 came down to the field as well.  We   
 had athletics until break.  We played 
 horses again.                         
                                       
 After break we had history.           
                                       
                                       </content>
