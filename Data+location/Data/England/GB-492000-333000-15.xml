		<title>15Grantham: Parascending.</title>
		<content> Parascending is artificial parachuting
 which involves being towed by a jeep  
 and being cut loose when you have     
 reached a suitable height.The         
 parachute is open before you start and
 as you run behind the jeep the force  
 of the wind takes you up.You are then 
 pulled through the air by the rope and
 you stay in the air for up to 5       
 minutes.                              
 Parascending in Grantham is done at   
 the Prince William of Gloucester      
 Barracks. The organisations which     
 participate are the scouting movement,
 the services, the cadets,the police   
 and any others brave enough to join in
 this daring sport.                    
 The instruction is given privately and
 costs in the region of Â£30 for the    
 necessary lessons,parachute,petrol and
 jeep.The minimum age is generally 16.
