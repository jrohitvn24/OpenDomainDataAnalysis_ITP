		<title>02 Aldridge Parish Church</title>
		<content> The Parish Church at Aldridge probably
 existed in Norman times. The present  
 structure dates back to the 13th      
 Century. The building was extended in 
 1841,1853 and 1975. Aldridge and Great
 Barr became seperate parishes in 1849.
 Nowadays we have the church of{St.    
{Mary The Virgin,}two other Anglican   
 churches and a Methodist Church       
 working together. The Rector used to  
 do all the work himself. In those days
 Aldridge was a small village of 800   
 people. Today lots of people work with
 him for Aldridge has become a large   
 town of nearly 18,000 people. On      
 Sundays hundreds of them meet together
 to worship. During the week boys and  
 girls,teenaged and adults meet to     
 study the bible, help one another and 
 enjoy each others company. Some meet  
 in homes for group fellowship. The    
 young people meet in the Church rooms.</content>
