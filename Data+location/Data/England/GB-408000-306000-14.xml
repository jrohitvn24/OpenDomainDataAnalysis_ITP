		<title>14VICTORIA HOSPITAL,LICHFIELD.</title>
		<content>  Lichfield Victoria Hospital was built
in 1933 on a site known as "The        
glorious sweep of the Friary Estate".  
Still evidenced today by the pleasant  
grounds which surround the hospital.   
  Funds were originally given from the 
Queen Victoria Jubilee Celebrations in 
1887 and a small premises was opened as
a private nursing home. It was later   
extended, and was known as Lichfield   
Victoria Nursing Home and Cottage      
Hospital.                              
  Today the Vic as it is known by local
people has 36 beds - male and female - 
and children - plus 12 maternity beds. 
It also houses a casualty department,  
several clinics and a dialysis unit.   
The hospital comes under the North     
Birmingham Health Authority and is a   
community hospital run by general      
practitioners. Approximately 80 staff  
are employed.                          </content>
