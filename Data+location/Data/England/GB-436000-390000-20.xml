		<title>20Sheffield Canal</title>
		<content>  Demand from the rapidly expanding    
 Sheffield steel industry in the early 
 19th C.led to a canal being built from
 the navigable Don at Tinsley to the   
 Canal Basin in the City Centre, thus  
 creating a water link to the North    
 Sea. The canal, named the {"Sheffield 
{&amp; South Yorkshire Navigation" }was    
 8ft. deep, had eleven locks, five of  
 which were at Tinsley, and was opened 
 in 1819. The rise in importance of the
 railways in the mid 19th C. led to the
 decline of the canal which fell into  
 disrepair and became heavily polluted.
  In 1985 plans are well in advance to 
 clean and repair the canal so that it 
 may be developed for leisure          
 activities. Already pleasure craft may
 be seen using the canal and the       
 reintroduction of fish to the cleaner 
 waters has enabled fishing matches to 
 take place.                           </content>
