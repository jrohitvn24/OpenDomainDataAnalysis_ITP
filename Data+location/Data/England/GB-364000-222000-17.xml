		<content>   Of the several footpaths crossing   
 our area some have been planted over  
 by local farmers and disappeared but  
 some are still used regularly.        
   The footpath from Hask Barn to the  
 Rectory no longer exists,it is now a  
 wheat field.From Pontshill Marsh to   
 Groomstool barn(now demolished)there  
 is a partly used footpath,but the     
 hedge half way along has been taken up
 where it cuts across to the Lea road. 
   There is a good footpath from       
 Eccleswall Farm to Ryeford.It starts  
 off as a good farm track and because  
 of the number of different types of   
 trees on it,may be 300 years old.After
 1 field the track ends in a field of  
 wheat.The path then runs along the    
 hedgerow to Ryeford.This would make a 
 good short cut from Bromsash to       
 Ryeford.From Lea road to Burton Court 
 is a well used farm track.            </content>
