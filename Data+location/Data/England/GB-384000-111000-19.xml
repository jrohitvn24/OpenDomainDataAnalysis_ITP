 EVENINGS THOUGH ALWAYS OPEN BUT IT IS 
 BUSY AT WEEKENDS AND CAN BE PACKED    
 WITH 70-80 PEOPLE AT SUNDAY LUNCHTIME.
  A TUESDAY EVENING - THE CAR PARK IS  
 PARTLY FILLED BY CARS AND VANS. LIGHTS
 AND VOICES COME FROM THE DOOR MARKED  
 SALOON. INSIDE THE CHAIRS AND TABLES  
 ARE EMPTY, EVERYONE IS STANDING BY THE
 BAR OR CLUSTERED AROUND THE POOL TABLE
 WHERE A MATCH AGAINST ANOTHER PUB IS  
 IN PROGRESS. GOOD NATURED BANTER IS   
 AIMED AT PLAYERS, OTHER CONVERSATIONS 
 ON CRICKET, WEATHER, CARS AND A VISIT 
 TO FRANCE GO ON IN THE BACKGROUND. THE
 PUBLICAN IS FAIRLY BUSY REFILLING     
 PINTS OF BEER. THE RESIDENT CAT SITS  
 ON A BAR STOOL. AT 10 PM. HUNKS OF    
 BREAD, CHEESE AND PICKLED ONIONS
