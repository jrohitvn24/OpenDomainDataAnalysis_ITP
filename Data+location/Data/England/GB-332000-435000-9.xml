		<content>Interviews were held with five         
octagenarians of Staining and the      
following interesting stories were     
told. The old barn at Baines Farm used 
to be a weaving shed. The workers      
wearing clogs walked from Kirkham to   
work in the clay-built shed. Baby      
calves are now reared there.  Two      
canonballs found at Baines Farm are    
thought to be from Oliver Cromwell's   
Army. They match another one found in  
St.Chad's Church Poulton.  A character 
known as Black Kirkham rode from       
Kirkham on a black horse and wearing a 
black cloak. He used to whip offenders 
at the whipping post in Poulton, then  
riding to Fleetwood Court to record his
actions. Old remedies included bacon   
fat around the neck for sore throats,  
boiled onion in the ear for earache and
pepper and brown paper for toothache.  
Baths were taken only on Fridays.      </content>
