		<content>  The majority of people prefer fast,  
 "junk," food but an increasing number 
 are eating health foods and are       
 worried about chemical additives in   
 food. "Junk food," includes frozen    
 meals, hamburger and pizza shops as   
 well as fish and chips. People like   
 sweet sauces like tomato ketchup and  
 sweet drinks like Coke. "Junk food,"  
 excludes fresh vegetables and salads. 
 Many children are overweight. Some    
 teenagers experiment with drugs.      
 Heroin addiction is becoming a big    
 problem as is alchohol abuse. Fewer   
 people seem to be smoking cigarettes  
 because of realisation of health      
 risks. Biscuits and sweets are        
 advertised widely on television.      
 Coffee and tea are still favourite    
 drinks. Pet foods are also widely     
 advertised as this industry makes a   
 profit of millions of pounds.         </content>
