		<content> In 1945 there were no washing machines
 so people who did their own washing   
 would have to do it by hand. The other
 alternative was to send the dirty     
 washing to the laundry. A van would   
 come round once a week and pick up all
 the washing when it would be taken to 
 a big laundry on Melton Road, and     
 washed. The number of people employed 
 there was about 25. Instead of buying 
 clothes as most people do today,people
 made their own. Girls made dresses and
 were perhaps better needlewomen than  
 they are now. Boys would probably have
 had hand-me-downs from older brothers 
 or fathers. At the end of the war most
 people had radios but television was  
 only just starting.In 1945 a bus fare 
 to{Ipswich}was 3d (1.5p) whereas now  
 it is 75p.On the whole people had less
 money to spend and had to make-do-and-
 mend.                {St. Mary's.}    </content>
