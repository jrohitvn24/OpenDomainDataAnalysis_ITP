		<title>08THE CATTERY AT LOWER HARDRES</title>
		<content> Cottage Cattery in Church Lane was    
 established in 1983 by two veterinary 
 nurses with the backing of the Man-   
 power Services Commission's Small     
 Business Scheme. 30 cats can be       
 boarded for convalescence or whilst   
 owners are unable to care for them.   
 The nurses and one full time assis-   
 tant give a 24 hour care service. All 
 cats must have current enteritis and  
 influenza injections. Standards must  
 satisfy the Environmental Health      
 Inspectors who make regular checks. In
 spotless white-painted kennels each   
 cat has its own heated house,         
 blanket and favorite toy. There are   
 larger kennels for exercise. Cats are 
 fed according to owners' wishes and   
 dietary instructions hang outside each
 house. The charge is Â£2 per day which 
 includes collection and delivery      
 service and covers insurance.         </content>
