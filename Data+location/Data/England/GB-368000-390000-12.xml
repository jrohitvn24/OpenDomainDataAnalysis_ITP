		<content>   Religious observance in the area    
 does not appear to be strong. Of the  
{89}families surveyed in the school    
 questionnaire{68 families}indicated   
 that{no one attended any religious    
{meetings.9 families}sent their        
 children to{Sunday School and church  
 but the parents did not accompany     
 them.Out of all the families          
 questioned we found that{3 fathers    
 went to church.                       
   We found that all of the churches in
 our block are Christian and are       
 different in the fact that they       
 belong to different denomination      
{Church of England,Pentecostal,        
{Methodist,Jehovah's Witness,          
{Congregational and Salvation Army.    
 Those members of the Roman Catholic   
 Church in this area are catered for in
 Irlam.There are no ethnic minorities  
 in the area.                          </content>
