		<content> I get up about 0810 hrs GMT, wash     
 myself and get dressed. I don't       
 have any breakfast. At about 0835 hrs 
 GMT I get a chocolate biscuit,open    
 the door on the side of my father's   
{Fiat}car and my Dad drives me to      
 St.James School{South Bank}where  I am
 educated.                             
 For dinner I usually have saute       
 potato,a pastie and beans followed by 
 a slice of sponge cake.To drink I     
 have water.                           
   I get home from school at about 1545
 hrs and then have my tea.I have salad 
 with wholemeal crispbread. I put my   
{Sinclair Spectrum 48K}on and play     
 Ghostbusters.At 2100 hrs I go upstairs
 and watch{television}until about 2300 
 hrs and then get into my bed with 4   
 blankets and a quilt on and go to     
 sleep.
