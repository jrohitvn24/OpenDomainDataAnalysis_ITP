		<title>13Recreation - Silloth</title>
		<content> For a small town  Silloth  has quite a
 lot of recreational clubs. The{18-hole
{golf course}is said to be very testing
 and it actually  attracts  many people
 to Silloth. The{ bowling club }has two
 greens  and a  clubhouse  called  "The
 Bower".  The England player  John Bell
 often plays there. The {rugby club}has
 a clubhouse on the playing field,  but
 its pitch is some distance away. It is
 very popular on Saturday nights. A new
{squash court}has just been opened near
 the rugby club.{The football clubhouse
 and pitch are also there.  New playing
 pitches are being laid out  at present
 and then  nearly all sports, including
{ladies' hockey} and  the {cricket club
 will be  in one  area.  The exclusions
 are the two hard{tennis courts }at the
 beginning of Skinburness Road, and the
{2 outdoor pools}at the caravan parks.
