		<title>09SHEEP FARMING</title>
		<content>    Sheep give us mutton and wool.     
    They need dipping twice a year for 
 sheep scab and other diseases. Sheep  
 scab are little mites which cause     
 sheep to rub against tree trunks and  
 fences and then the wool starts to    
 come off.                             
    Sheep are sheared once a year      
 usually between May and July. It is   
 now mostly done by an electric        
 shearing machine.                     
    The ewes or female sheep lamb once 
 a year,mostly between January and May.
 If a ewe rejects a lamb or if it dies 
 it is called a kade and needs to be   
 hand reared .                         
    We keep Suffolk, Suffolk-Cross and 
 Mules. On our farm there are about    
 seventy-five sheep and lambs.         
    One acre of land supports four     
 sheep and eight lambs.
