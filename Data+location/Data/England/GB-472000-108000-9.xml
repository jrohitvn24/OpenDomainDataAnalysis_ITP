		<content> Only the portion of the farm to the   
 south of Pits copse lies within the   
 area under consideration. These two   
 fields are permanent pasture and have 
 been used for grazing since 1780.     
 Pits copse was felled in 1984 and the 
 timber was sold by tender. The trees  
 were mature oak between 120 and 150   
 years old. A resident of westbourne   
 has the contract for the underwood    
 which he sells as firewood.(Underwood 
 is timber which grows under main crop 
 and used to be cut on a 20 year cycle,
 although this area had not been cut   
 since the 2nd World War due to lack of
 demand.) The copse is due to be       
 replanted with broadleaf timber in the
 near future.
