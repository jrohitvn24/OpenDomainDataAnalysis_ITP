		<title>01MERE  HALL</title>
		<content> Mere Hall is 450 years old. It is a   
 large black and white farmhouse. Parts
 of the building are older than others 
 because the house was built in stages 
 with rooms added on as they were      
 needed. This makes the house look     
 uneven. One of the windows is slanting
 as the wall has slipped. Some of the  
 windows are mullioned and have leaded 
 lights. At the back of Mere Hall there
 is a black iron gate; behind this gate
 a few sheep are grazing.{Mere Hall has
{a fishpond or mere after which the    
{hall was named.}It now has a swimming 
 pool as well
