		<content> This{historic building}has been under 
 attack from the Shropshire County     
 council because they want each child  
 to have the same{education.}The Adams{
{Grammar School}is found in Lower Bar  
 and dates from 1656.This building is  
 an attractive focal point of central  
 Newport.The founder of the school     
 William Adams was a member of the     
 London company of Haberdashers who    
 have the majority membership on the   
 school governing body.About 400 boys  
 aged 11-19 attend the school after a  
 selection examination.(275 day pupils 
 ,125 fee-paying{boarders}).There is a 
 large sixth form of 90 boys.Senior{   
{boarders}are housed on the one side of
 the high street.Junior boys stay at   
 Longford hall. In July 1985 the       
 governors of the Adams Grammar school 
 plan to re-name the school to         
 'Haberdashers' Adams' Grammar School. </content>
