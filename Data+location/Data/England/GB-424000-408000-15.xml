		<title>15HOUSING</title>
		<content>  Clayton West housing consists mainly 
 of modern cul'de'sacs, ten to fifteen 
 years old.Most of the old housing is  
 up Victoria Street and in Scissett.   
   Pennine Way is part of a modern     
 housing estate in Scissett. The houses
 there are detached. Many are ten to   
 fifteen years old and are made from a 
 mixture of brick and stone.           
    There is a small group of detached 
 houses made from red brick on the side
 of Wheatley Hill.                     
     There are quite a few old stone   
 houses on Wakefield Road,and these    
 houses,dating from the 1900's are     
 cheaper, selling for Â£16,000 to       
 Â£25,000. A lot of these have been     
 changed into shop.
