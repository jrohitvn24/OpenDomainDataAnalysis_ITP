		<title>18Marwell Zoological Park 4.</title>
		<content> The Park is financed chiefly through  
 visitor admission charges since,in    
 contrast to most of the E.E.C.,there  
 is no government support for such     
 establishments.Other sources of       
 finance are an Animal Adoption Scheme,
 donations and grants from industry and
 Local Authorities and membership of   
 the Marwell Zoological Society.       
 The Park is advertised over a radius  
 of 30-40 miles -basically the area    
 served by the local I.T.V.transmitter.
 Visitor numbers are in the order of   
 220,000 annually,the Park being open  
 all year.                             
 A short sample survey of visitors     
 early on a Sunday morning in May 1985 
 revealed that 56% of the interviewees 
 lived in Hampshire and 22% in adjacent
 counties. Many had made more than one 
 visit to the Park.
