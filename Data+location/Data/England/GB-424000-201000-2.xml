		<title>02The Church at Langford.</title>
		<content>  St.Matthew's (C of E) Church displays
some of the best Saxon architecture in 
England. It was built over a thousand  
years ago. It has a tower which is     
entirely Anglo-Saxon. There is a figure
of Christ in Majesty which dates from  
before the Norman Conquest and is known
as the Langford Rood.                  
  Services are held every Sunday at    
18.00hrs. About twenty people come to  
the meetings.They do not have a Sunday 
School because they are unable to find 
anyone to organise it. There is no     
choir. There have been three weddings  
in the first six months of 1985.       
The school sometimes uses the church.  
  There are three volunteer ladies     
who clean the church and are unpaid.The
vicar and his wife live in the vicarage
opposite the church.There are six bells
in the tower which are only played on  
special occasions.                     </content>
