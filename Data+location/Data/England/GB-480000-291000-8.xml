		<content> There is no resident doctor in        
 Medbourne but a group practice based  
 in Kibworth, eight miles away, have a 
 surgery in a local house two mornings 
 a week.  There is also a group        
 practice at Market Harborough and     
 Corby about the same distance away.   
 Most people use Market Harborough for 
 optical services, dentists and        
 chemists.  Two members of the Women's 
 Institute fetch prescriptions for     
 anyone without transport.             
 The District Nurse, Health Visitor and
 home helps call in the area when      
 needed and transport is provided to   
 take the elderly to a chirodist in    
 Market Harborough every two months.   
 Meals on Wheels are prepared in Market
 Harborough and delivered but this     
 service is currently little used.
