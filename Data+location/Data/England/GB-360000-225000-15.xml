 In 1933 Miss Keen came to Brampton to 
 live with her parents. Miss Keen had  
 a job in Hereford so she could  not be
 with her parents most of the time. She
 managed to see her parents on the     
 weekend. She had this job for several 
 years. Just after the war she was told
 that she was a member of the British  
 Empire.In 1953 her Mother died so she 
 had to look after her father.When the 
 Queen was crowned there was a party
