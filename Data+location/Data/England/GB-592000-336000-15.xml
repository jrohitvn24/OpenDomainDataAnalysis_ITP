		<title>15Walsingham School 1912</title>
		<content> You attended this school from 5 to    
 14.The{six classrooms}were heated     
 with{open fires}.There was no canteen 
 so the children either had to bring   
 their own food or go home for it.There
 was no electricity so you had to use{ 
{oil lamps}.There used to be long      
 sloping desks and tip_up seats.The    
 teachers desk was very high so he     
 could see the class.There was no hot  
 taps.The big boys had to{pump water}  
 from the well into a tank to last all 
 day.The toilets weren't like modern   
 ones.There was a bucket with a wooden 
 seat on top.One night during the week 
  a{night_cart}came to empty them.The{ 
{playground}was{gravel}not             
 concrete.There was no school_house.In 
 stead there was a garden and the big  
 boys had to look after it.
