		<content> 7.CHEQUERS PUB.,dating from the 15th  
 century when it was a coaching inn, is
 said to be haunted by prisoners from  
 Mary Tudor's reign, who were locked up
 before being burned. In 1953 exorcism 
 was attempted but failed. In 1964 the 
 new manager asked a medium for help.  
 At that time a white-hooded figure    
 appeared, doors opened and screaming  
 was heard.Afterwards all was quiet    
 until 1978 when the ghost reappeared. 
 It is still seen occasionally.
