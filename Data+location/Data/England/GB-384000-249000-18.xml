		<title>18NORTON BARRACKS.</title>
		<content>   The Barracks were built between     
 January 1875 and September 1876 on 25 
 acres of land purchased from the Earl 
 of Coventry. As well as officers'     
 quarters, there was accomodation for  
 224 single and 32 married soldiers.   
 The papers called it 'Norton Military 
 Depot'.                               
   The depot expanded during the late  
 19th century and became the home of   
 the Worcestershire Regiment. One side 
 effect on the village of Norton is    
 that many of the soldiers married     
 villge girls and settled there after  
 army life.                            
   The barracks closed down in the     
 1970's. The grounds surrounding       
 the Barracks are currently used as a  
 sports ground, but the buildings are  
 left derilict although there are plans
 to convert them into a luxury hotel.
