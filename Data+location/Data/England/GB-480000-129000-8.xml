		<content>     The Royal Anchor is very famous   
 because Nelson who is Lord Nelson had 
 his last breakfast there before he set
 off for victory down at Portsmouth.   
 Also in the Royal Anchor ther are some
 bones up one of the chimneys because  
 one of the criminals climbed up there 
 but the guards shot him but he never  
 came down until a few years ago when  
 he fell down into the fire. In one of 
 the rooms there is wupposed to be a   
 ghost because the owners were sleeping
 and the son was talking to this ghost 
 but when they heard their speaking    
 they looked up but they did not see   
 anything there. Now the Royal Anchor  
 is a pub and restaurant and that is   
 it.  It is no longer a hotel for      
 people to stay; but a Berni Inn, one  
 of a large chain of steak houses.
