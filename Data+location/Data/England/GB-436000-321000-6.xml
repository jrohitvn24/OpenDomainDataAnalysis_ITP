		<content> Staunton Harold Reservoir is a linear 
 expanse of water in the natural valley
 between Melbourne,Calke and Staunton  
 Harold, fed by two small lakes with a 
 main pumping station. The surrounding 
 banking of the reservoir is mainly    
 farmland, pasture for grazing and     
 arable for wheat and barley crops. The
 S.W. side is covered with planted     
 woodland, deciduous and conifers,     
 known as Spring Wood and Melbourne    
 Plantation. There are bird watching   
 hides in these woods to view the      
 varied bird life e.g. ducks geese     
 gulls swans heron kingfisher coot     
 moorhen and grebes. The water is used 
 for a variety of leisure activities - 
 fishing(by permit only) sailing and   
 windsurfing. The N.E. side is a       
 recreational walk running from        
 Broadstone Lane to the Windmill       
 car-park.                             </content>
