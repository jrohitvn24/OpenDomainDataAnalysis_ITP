		<title>16Our House.</title>
		<content> Our house is a semi-detatched. We have
 8 rooms; 3 bedrooms,dining room,      
 living room, bathroom, toilet and     
 kitchen. We have a garden at the front
 and back. We have a greenhouse at the 
 bottom of the garden with tomatoes in 
 it. We have got a coal house as well. 
 We heat our water with a coal fire. We
 have got 2 gas fires which take       
 cylinders. We have got a gas cooker   
 and a washing machine. We have got a  
 boiler which our dog sleeps           
 underneath. We have got a little room 
 under the stairs and there's a place  
 where we pay for the gas. Our house is
 made out of breeze blocks. The        
 downstairs floor is concrete and the  
 upstairs floor is made of wood. Nearby
 the houses are similar but some are   
 built of brick. All the houses in our 
 street belong to the council.
