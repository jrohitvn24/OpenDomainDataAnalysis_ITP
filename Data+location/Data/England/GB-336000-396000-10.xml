		<title>10MY FAMILY'S LEISURE TIME</title>
		<content> My mum spends her spare time working  
 in the garden to make it nice to sit  
 out in during the summer. My dad's    
 spare time is spent sitting in an     
 armchair reading a newspaper, cleaning
 the car or caravan, or helping in the 
 garden. My brother, David 13, plays   
 football in the park or goes on a     
 bicycle ride to{Ormskirk}about 6 miles
 away, to visit a friend. My other     
 brother, Seth 9, plays snooker on his 
 snooker table or at a local club.  My 
 sister, Jane 4, plays in the garden   
 with her dolls, teddy bear, or on the 
 swing or slide. I play football in the
 park with my brother.  I am in the    
 school football team and we won medals
 in the local league this year.
