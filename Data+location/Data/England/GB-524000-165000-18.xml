		<content> The London Borough of Sutton Community
 Programme is to restore the natural   
 line of the River Wandle and its      
 botany.Work began in early 1984.      
  About twelve years ago the river was 
 wider so the rubbish flowed along     
 easily. However at Dale Park Bend, the
 flow slowed down and rubbish started  
 to collect, causing a terrible smell. 
 The Water Board received complaints   
 and decided to narrow the river so    
 that it would flow faster and keep    
 cleaner.                              
  Ecologists have complained that      
 certain plants no longer grow, so the 
 river should be widened!              
  Plans to transform the Wandle into a 
 community and leisure area have       
 gradually been put together.          
  A wildlifesanctury and a National    
 Trust area are adjacent to the River  
 Wandle near to Mitcham.               </content>
