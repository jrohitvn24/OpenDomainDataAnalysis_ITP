		<title>15A Child's View of Thorney</title>
		<content> Living in{Thorney}has many advantages.
 The school is near and this makes it  
 easy to get there without a bus ride  
 for most people. The{village}is a     
 friendly place with lots of joy. It is
 a noisy village with much{wildlife    
 flourishing in many places. One       
 disadvantage is that we cannot always 
 buy the things we need, so we have to 
 travel to{Peterborough}which is seven 
 miles away. The village is quite      
 dangerous because of the busy road but
 people are always careful and         
 accidents are extremely rare. The     
 school is called{The Duke Of Bedford  
 and is near the{A47.}Soon there will  
 be a{by-pass}around the village       
 because there are many old buildings  
 with crumbling foundations. We have   
 our own vicar and also our own doctor 
 and a few shops. We like{Thorney.
