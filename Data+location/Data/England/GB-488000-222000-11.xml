		<title>11Tiddenfoot Pit</title>
		<content>    Tiddenfoot Pit is an old sand      
 quarry which has been filled with     
 water. All around it are very high,   
 beautiful banks covered in grass.     
 There are lots of trees on one side,  
 most of them are willows. On the      
 opposite side there is a line of      
 poplar trees. Behind these is the     
 Grand Union Canal. Often there are    
 swans and ducks on the water.         
 Fishermen from the local Anglers' Club
 are allowed to fish there. Children   
 catch tadpoles, water snails and other
 tiny water creatures there. It is a   
 lovely place to have a walk. There are
 many wild flowers such as clover,     
 daisies, dandelions and bird's foot   
 trefoil, otherwise known as Eggs and  
 Bacon. There is white campbell and a  
 few others too. On a hot day the pit  
 is shady and on a windy day it is     
 sheltered.                            </content>
