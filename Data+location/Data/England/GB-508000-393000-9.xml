		<content> There are a variety of housing types  
 in the villages including old stone   
 cottages, brick houses and            
 bungalows.Of these the majority are   
 owner occupied but some are rented.   
 The rented properties include those   
 owned by West LIndsey District Council
 and those owned by local farmers for  
 use by their employees.  These are    
 usually charged out at a low rent and 
 may constitute a part of the farm     
 worker's salary. The houses generally 
 have fairly large gardens and most    
 people grow at least some of their own
 vegetables. Any new development in the
 area is small scale due to the        
 agricultural nature of the area. There
 are also a large number of farm       
 buildings and barns.  Many of them are
 built of stone or brick with clay     
 pantile roofs.
