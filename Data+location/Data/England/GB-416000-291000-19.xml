		<title>19TRADE IN CURDWORTH AREA</title>
		<content> THIS IS LARGELY AN AGRICULTURAL AREA  
 WITH RELATIVELY SMALL RESIDENTIAL     
 SECTORS. IT ENJOYS THE PROXIMITY OF   
 LARGE URBAN AREAS WITHIN EASY REACH,  
 WHERE CONSUMERS MAY BUY CONVENIENTLY  
 AND OFTEN MORE CHEAPLY, OVER A WIDE   
 RANGE OF GOODS AND SERVICES. TRADE IN 
 CURDWORTH THEREFORE TENDS TO EXIST IN 
 TERMS OF SMALL LOCAL SERVICES AND A   
 SHOP SELLING ESSENTIAL HOUSEHOLD GOODS
 TO A CASUAL DEMAND RATHER THAN IN     
 BULK. THE POST OFFICE GENERAL STORE   
 THEREFORE PROSPERS AND IS A FOCAL     
 POINT IN THE VILLAGE. THE LOCAL GARAGE
 AUGMENTS ITS TURNOVER BY SELLING      
 ANGLING EQUIPMENT AND VEGETABLE       
 PRODUCE, SOME LOCALLY PRODUCED. MOBILE
 SALESMEN SELLING FISH, POULTRY AND    
 DAIRY PRODUCE VISIT REGULARLY. THE    
 HYPERMARKET WITHIN TEN MINUTES BY     
 ROAD RENDERS ADDITIONAL RETAIL GOODS.
