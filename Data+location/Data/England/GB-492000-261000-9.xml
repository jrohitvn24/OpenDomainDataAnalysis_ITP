		<content>   Some customs such as wearing a sprig
 of oak on Oak Apple Day and celeb_    
 rating Cattern have died out, but     
 events connected with the church are  
 still celebrated regularly.  The      
 Harvest Festival is held each year and
 followed by a Harvest Supper - usually
 at the  Barn. The September Fete is   
 held at Hinwick House followed by a   
 supper - sometimes at school.         
  The Shaftesbury Society hold a fete  
 in June/July followed by a mini fete  
 in the winter months.                 
   The school mini market is a popular 
 annual event as is the school Carol   
 Concert and Nativity Play held by     
 tradition in the church.  School      
 concerts and sports are supported by  
 the village.                          
   The Queen's Silver Jubilee was      
 celebrated with a day of pageantry and
 feasting.                             </content>
