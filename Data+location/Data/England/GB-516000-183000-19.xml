		<title>19Attitudes: Wembley Stadium</title>
		<content>  Sometimes I hate{Wembley Stadium }   
 because when there is an event like a 
 match on there are nearly always      
 hooligans hanging about.              
  I live near the Stadium and nearly   
 every Saturday there's a match on and 
 lots of people hang about the "Harrow 
 Tavern",which is a public house in    
 front of our house.                   
  I hope that Wembley Stadium buy      
 security cameras to catch all the     
 hooligans.                            
  The time when I like Wembley is when 
 there are no hooligans and the match  
 is a friendly game. Concerts like the 
 Live Aid one are held there as well.  
  Next to Wembley Stadium,in the car   
 park,there is a market which is held  
 every Sunday.
