		<title>20SCIENCE &amp; TECH. in EASTLEIGH</title>
		<content>  Eastleigh does not boast any High _  
 Tech Industries but there are signs   
 that modern technology is making      
 itself felt. I.B.M. the large computer
 manufacturer,has taken over some of   
 the new offices in the town.          
  In the industrial areas of the town  
 there are quite a lot of printers and 
 typesetters,the largest being Joseph  
 Caustons,who produce high quality     
 books.The majority of these companies 
 are modernising their production and  
 installing computerised machinery.    
  Point of sale computers are becoming 
 more evident in the form of Bar Code  
 Readers in large supermarkets.        
  All of the banks in the town now have
 Cash Dispensers which are linked to a 
 central computer in London.           
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
