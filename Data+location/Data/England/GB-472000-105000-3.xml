		<content> One of the main industrial resources  
 in{Emsworth}is fishing and seafood    
 such as mussels and clams.Also the    
 Public Houses are an expanding        
 business.There are altogether eight   
 Public Houses in {Emsworth}alone.There
 are about five Building Contractors,  
 building has been an up and down      
 business.Next to the other industries 
 there is one that is growing day by   
 day;that industry is ship building and
 repairs.Several years ago in{Emsworth}
 there were only three ship builders   
 but now there about seven ship        
 builders.                             
 Yet big international or national     
 firms such as{I.B.M}or{Plessey,Racon  
 or{Mellordata}software firm have not  
 made big factories in{Emsworth},but   
 small ones are expanding into large   
 ones.
