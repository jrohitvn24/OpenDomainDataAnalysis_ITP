		<content> Is a flint and stone building of      
 Norman origin,and was completed in    
 1300.It consists of Chancel with North
 and South Chapels,a nave with North   
 aisle of five bays,South              
 transept,South Porch and a North West 
 tower containing five bells.          
 The first Rector of the Church was    
 John De Munden(1307).There have been  
 48 Rectors with the present one being 
 Hugh Vaughan Crossley.The oldest relic
 in the Church is a christening font   
 which dates back to the Saxon times.  
 On July 9th 1926 a fire partially     
 destroyed the roof of the Church.     
 Inside the Church are photographs to  
 show the extent of the damage.        
 Youngsters from the village cleaned   
 the Churchyard up in response to an   
 appeal by the Church Warden asking    
 them to show more interest in the     
 community.                            </content>
