<title>21Knowlton and the wildflowers 2011</title>
<content>

In &amp;#34;Return of the Native&amp;#34; Thomas Hardy describes Egdon Heath as &amp;#34;A Face on which Time makes but Little Impression&amp;#34;. The same might be said of Knowlton - Henge Monument. So special a place and yet always the same.&amp;#13;&amp;#10;English Heritage Handbook 2010/11 says of this Knowlton Church and Earthworks - &amp;#34;The siting of this ruined medieval church at the centre of a Neolithic ritual henge earthwork symbolises the transition from pagan to Christian worship&amp;#34;. Also, surprisingly a Damory &amp;#39;bus 325 on Thursdays only ( Market Day in Blandford ) is available nearby.&amp;#13;&amp;#10;On the day of visiting a firm from Taunton, Somerset was cutting the grass around the earthwork. It was under contract to English Heritage and was to be at Stonehenge in Wiltshire the next week to do a similar job. The contractors were very mindful of the precious wildlife and that grass cutting could only be done to fit in with the flowering times of the chalkland species, so valuable in the area.Although this issue was mentioned in 1986 the general public is certainly more aware of such matters in 2011.   &lt;br />
