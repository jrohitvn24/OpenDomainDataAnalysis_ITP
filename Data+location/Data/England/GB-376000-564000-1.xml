		<title>01BARDON MILL AND AREA</title>
		<content> There are many small hamlets gathered 
 along the low lying banks of the S.   
 Tyne as it runs from W. to E. Each is 
 serviced by the road and railway which
 follows the valley. None of the       
 settlements have a shop except for    
 Bardon Mill with its Post Office/Store
 but the local service station now     
 sells some groceries. Bus and train   
 services are two hourly so most people
 have to rely on car for travel to work
 or for shopping. Local work is farming
 but most inhabitants of the           
 settlements work in the larger towns  
 od Haltwhistle to W. and Hexham to E. 
 There is a high proportion of         
 professionals who commute even        
 further. Farms, mostly sheep or cattle
 to fatten, arable for winter food for 
 animals. Vindolanda Roman Fort to the 
 N. is still being developed as tourist
 attraction with museum and wall       </content>
