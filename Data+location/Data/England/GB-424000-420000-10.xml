		<title>10EASTBOROUGH FIRST SCHOOL</title>
		<content> I get up at six o'clock in the        
 morning and I go downstairs and I wash
 my face and my hands.Then I get       
 dressed and have my breakfast,things  
 like cornflakes and tea, then  comb my
 hair and I set off for the school.    
 I walk to school and I come with      
 Njabid.I get in the playground and I  
 find Akmal and we play marbles.I play 
 with Akmal and Iftikhar.We play for   
 five minutes then we go for our       
 dinners.We eat things like fish, chips
 and beans.Me,Iftikhar and Akmal go    
 outside and play marbles until the    
 bell goes,and then we line up.        
 I go to the Mosque at 4 o'clock and I 
 pray there until our master comes and 
 he listens to us. If I don't know some
 words our master says remember next   
 time, then we go home.                
 I play outside until 8 o'clock and I  
 go to bed at 9 o'clock.               </content>
