		<title>05WEST BERGHOLT</title>
		<content>   West Bergholt is a small village    
 situated two miles to the north west  
 of Colchester. The village could be   
 described as quiet or even sleepy.    
  The village has grown considerably   
 over the last ten to twenty years.    
 This has been due almost entirely to  
 the fact that the village has         
 excellent access to the nearby        
 Colchester railway station. Commuters 
 can reach the station in five minutes 
 and regular services to London's      
 Liverpool St. Station means that      
 commuters can be in the City in one   
 hour.                                 
  As well as the easy acces to the     
 train services the main A12 to London 
 is immediately on the doorstep of the 
 village.
