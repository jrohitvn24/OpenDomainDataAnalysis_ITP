		<content> The Forestry Commission owns two areas
 of woodland near Bassenthwaite,forming
 a major industry in this area         
 1.Park Wood-135 acres bought in 1964. 
 2.Dodd Wood-750 acres bought in 1948. 
 Types of Trees grown-1.Conifers:_     
 Larch, Douglas Fir, Sitka Spruce.     
 2.Hardwood:- e.g. Oak, Ash, Birch     
 Management- Before they are planted   
 the foliage is dipped in fluid called 
 gammac oil to prevent disease. After  
 they are planted they are left to grow
 for about twenty years.Then they are  
 felled and sent to the various mills. 
 Problems- The main threats are        
 Insects, Beetles, Canker and Butt Rot.
 Deer eat the tops of young trees.     
 Uses- Most of the trees go to make    
 pulp wood. The rest go to make posts  
 and rails.
