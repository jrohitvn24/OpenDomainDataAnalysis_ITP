		<title>08PACKINGTON ESTATE,ISLINGTON</title>
		<content>  The Packington Estate is 15 years    
old.The flats are in good condition    
now.A few years ago they were thinking 
of pulling them down because they were 
sinking.We had no hot water or heating 
for five months so we had to use       
immersion heaters.Three months after we
had new central heating fitted in.The  
flats started to let in rain.The roofs 
were re-tarred and this took 7 months. 
We then all had new gas meters fitted. 
Then we had squatters in some of the   
flats but now they have been evicted.  
   There are nearly 700 flats on the   
estate and at present the outsides are 
being re-decorated.They may build a    
community hall if they can find the    
space.I like living there and have some
good friends but I don't like the gangs
of boys hanging round the flats at     
night.We need more places for youth.
