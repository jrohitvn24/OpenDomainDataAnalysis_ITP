		<title>04FARMING IN THE DISTRICT</title>
		<content>  In the area around{Weeley Heath}much 
 of the land is arable. We visited     
 three farms which we hoped would      
 provide a variety of different styles 
 of farming. The first farm was Ken    
 Muir's Honeypot Fruit Farm, the second
 was Rowheath Farm (arable), and the   
 third was{Ampers Wick Farm}(beef).    
   Honeypot Fruit Farm has existed for 
 around thirty years and has around    
 fifteen acres of land which is mainly 
 used for{strawberries}and other soft  
 fruit. They import from the continent 
 around 80% of all the new varieties of
 strawberries. They test them on the   
 farm. They also supply{house plants}to
 shops such as Marks and Spencer and   
 Sainsbury's.                          
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
