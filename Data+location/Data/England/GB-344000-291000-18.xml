		<title>18HOPE BOWDLER AND CHELMICK</title>
		<content>     Hope Bowdler is south east of     
 Church Stretton. It is a very small   
 quiet village. Every year there is a  
 fete at the Church Hall to raise money
 for the Church.                       
     The first Church was built about{ 
{1237 but it was knocked down in 1862  
 and was rebuilt from local stone and  
 finished in{1864.}                    
     There are no shops or pubs in Hope
 Bowdler though some residents would   
 like one.                             
     There is one horticultural nursery
 in Soudley. Two years ago there was a 
 Post Office which sold sweets and     
 stamps but in{1981}it was converted   
 into a house.                         
     There are two barns, one is now a 
 house and one is still being altered. 
     Chelmick is in a quiet valley.    
 The farmers' land is very bumpy but   
 some fields grow corn.                </content>
