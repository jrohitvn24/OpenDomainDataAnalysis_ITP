		<title>20Oxford United Football Club</title>
		<content>Oxford United used to be called        
Headington United. They achieved league
status in 1962. The ground is called   
"The Manor"it is on the London Road in 
Headington.The ground is quite small   
with a capasity of only 14,500 in the  
season of 1984-85.They are putting a 2m
fence around the pitch with 17 gates   
for emergencies.They are changing the  
seats to non inflamable ones,because of
the Bradford disaster.They are not go- 
ing to sell alchol before the matches. 
This year they won the 2nd division    
championships and were promoted to the 
first division.The manager has gone to 
Q.P.R. for a better salary, and the    
club hopes to get a player manager.I   
have been supporting Oxford for 4      
seasons,and I have collected about 100 
programes.The home supporters stand in 
London Road,Osler Road or Beech Road,  
you can also sit in Beech Road.        </content>
