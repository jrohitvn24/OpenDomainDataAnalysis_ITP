		<title>16Easby Village.</title>
		<content>  There are twenty one houses in{Easby 
 village including the vicarage. The   
 nineteenth century stables of{Easby   
{Hall}have been converted into 7 modern
 cottages by the owner of the hall who 
 is a builder. Opposite the hall, seven
 modern houses have been built to blend
 in with other buildings around a      
 courtyard. By the river there are     
 boarding{kennels},where people leave  
 their dogs when they go on holiday.   
{Easby Abbey}has a lot of tourists each
 year. Tourists visit{Richmond Castle  
 then come down river to the ruined    
 abbey and the twelfth century church. 
 Money is being raised for roof        
 restoration for the church. At the top
 of the hill there is an{echoing stone.
 You stand on the stone and shout. Your
 voice hits the ruins and echoes back  
 to you.  (B.Aspden,S.Carr)
