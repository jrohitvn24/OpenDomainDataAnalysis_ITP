		<content>   My name is{Sarah Manuel}and I am 11 
 years old. Next term I am going to    
{Stanchester Comprehensive school}and I
 am absolutely dreading it! We took    
 some{tests}to decide which class we   
 would go into. Then a{teacher}from    
 that school{came to talk}to us about  
 detentions, dinners, not wearing      
 jewellery,timetables, sports kit and  
 lots of other things we should know.  
   It feels strange to think that I'm  
 going to be at the bottom of that     
 school when I am at the top of this   
 school now.There are five years in    
 Stanchester and it will be weird to   
 have the older pupils telling me what 
 to do.I hope they don't bully me!!    
   It will be awful to have tons of    
{homework}each night because here we   
 have very little.Right now I wish I   
 didn't have to go, but I expect I     
 shall soon feel at home there.        </content>
