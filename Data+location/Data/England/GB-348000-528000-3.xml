		<title>03Penrith: Auction Mart</title>
		<content> Penrith Mart has been on its present  
 site for over a hundred years.  it is 
 a busy and flourshing mart owned by   
 Penrith Farmers and Kidds.  It is a   
 noted North of England Market for the 
 sale of well-bred dairy cattle.  The  
 weekly sales (Tuesday) have a very    
 good selection of newly calved        
 friesian cows and Heifers from local  
 farms and all from full Brucellosis   
 Accredited Herds.  The mart also has  
 annual sales of breeding sheep which  
 are amongst the largest in the        
 country. The autumn lamb sales also   
 include local breeds off the Lakeland 
 Fells, and the Pennines.  Some of the 
 farmers that attend todays marts are  
 third and fourth generation farmers.  
 Thoes that are buying or selling      
 stand around the selling ring, but on 
 the benches around the ring are the   
 retired farmers.                      </content>
