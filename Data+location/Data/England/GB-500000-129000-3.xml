		<title>03THE WEY AND ARUN CANAL.</title>
		<content>{ The Wey and Arun Canal}was built in  
 three years. It was opened on the 29th
 September 1816. It started at         
 Shalford, passed through Bramley,     
 Cranleigh and Elmbridge to Loxwood,   
 Drungewick and Pulborough. The canal  
 quickly fell out of use because more  
 technical vehicles were being used.   
 There are ten locks and three         
 aquaducts which need a lot of         
 repairing.                            
 The land around the canal is heavily  
 overgrown. There is lots of Cow       
 Parsley, Stitchwort and Herb Robert.  
{The Wey and Arun Canal Trust}is trying
 to repair the canal and is raising    
 money for this purpose. A new bridge  
 has been built at Loxwood.            
{The Wey South Path,}linking the North 
 and South Downs follows the canal.
