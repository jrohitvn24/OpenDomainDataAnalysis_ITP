		<content> This{Summer Wine Country}on the       
 northern flanks of the upper Don      
 Valley varies from 240m to 415m a.s.l.
 The lower and better quality land     
 provides feed for cattle and sheep.   
 The higher land is peat, moorland and 
 poor grazing. The population of less  
 than 1000 live in a number of         
 scattered villages and farms. The main
 villages are Crowedge with about 100  
 dwellings, Carlecote with 30 and      
 Townhead with 6 plus a{Commune}in two 
 rows of old terraced houses of local  
 blue brick which was once the main    
 product of the internationally known  
 firm of{Hepworth Iron Company}which   
 now makes drainage pipes from local   
 clay. Apart from the success of H.I.C.
 the amenities and population of the   
 region have declined over the years   
 with the loss of railways, churches,  
 schools and housing.                  </content>
