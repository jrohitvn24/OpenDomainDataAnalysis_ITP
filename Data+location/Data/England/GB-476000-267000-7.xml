		<content>     Before 1975, the combined acreage 
 of{Moulton Lodge and North Farm}was   
 devoted to the production of          
 vegetables and cereal crops.In        
 addition a herd of 180 cows was       
 kept for milk production.At this time,
 five men were employed.               
     1975 saw the replacement of the   
 dairy herd by 100 head of beef cattle 
 which along with the arable, employed 
 three men.Since 1979, the land has    
 been{entirely arable}growing wheat,   
 barley, oats and oil-seed rape.       
  Increasing mechanisation has resulted
 in the farm using{fewer full time     
{workers}but with a much greater level 
 of productivity.                      
    In addition to the farm owner, one 
 full-time worker is employed and he   
 earns{Â£145}per week.A part-time worker
 is taken on during July, August and   
 September.                            </content>
