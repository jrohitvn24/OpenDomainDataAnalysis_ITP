		<content>{Chilwell}is located on the W.S.W. side
 of Nottingham, which is about 7Km.    
 away and the River Trent which lies   
 2Km to the south.                     
 Chilwell is now a residential area    
 with few places of work, although     
 there are a few{textile works}and a   
 large Government Depot. This was once 
 a very important employer during the  
 first and second world wars but is now
 to be taken over.                     
 Chilwell was a farming settlement     
 until the mid 19th century when       
 several{lace}mills were built. Lace is
 still made on frames in one factory in
 Chilwell.                             
 Chilwell is now best known in the area
 for its Sports centre and large       
 Comprehensive School.
