		<title>10Hoddlesden  Village</title>
		<content> Hoddlesden is a small village nestling
 between the hills of Pickup Bank and  
 Hoddlesden Moss.The village originally
 developed because of the local coal   
 and clay pits.Then the textile        
 industry developed here because of the
 favourable conditions.Both these      
 industries brought work into          
 Hoddlesden.Now all the mining has gone
 but new housing development has       
 increased and people have come to     
 Hoddlesden not,as in the past,to work 
 but purely to live.The old part of the
 village is situated in the            
 centre,around Queen's Square.The new  
 housing development began in the      
 1960's and has only recently been     
 completed.The village is surrounded by
 farm land,mostly rough pasture which  
 is used for dairy cattle.There are    
 only limited facilities in the village
 so most people travel into Darwen.    </content>
