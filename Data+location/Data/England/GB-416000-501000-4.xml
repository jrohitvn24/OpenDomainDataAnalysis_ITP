		<title>04Richmond Swimming Pool</title>
		<content>   Richmond Baths are at the bottom of 
 Station Bank.There are two pools,a    
 deep one,25 metres long for swimmers  
 and a shallow one for learners and    
 young children.There are changing     
 rooms and a cafe where you can buy    
 refreshments and watch people swimming
 from the balcony.There are no diving  
 boards but I think divers should use a
 diving pool.                          
   I go swimming once or twice a       
 week;and with school fortnightly.I go 
 once a week to a swimming club to     
 perfect my swimming.I am in the top   
 group.Sometimes I go with my parents  
 or to the Fun Hour.Then there are all 
 sorts of things to play with such as a
 giant inflateable octopus,rings and a 
 huge ball.When I go with my parents we
 finish off by going to the cafe for   
 refreshments and to watch other people
 swim.     Joanne Hill.                </content>
