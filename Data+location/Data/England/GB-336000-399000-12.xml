		<content> The area is a prosperous part of      
 Merseyside with very good housing and 
 a semi-rural environment.  Most people
 had moved into the area dsuring the   
 last 3O years and appreciated the     
 improvements in their life style in   
 comparison to city life in Liverpool  
 They enjoy being close to the         
 countryside and within easy reach of  
 the amenities of the city.  Their     
 complaints were mostly concerned with 
 damage to property and surroundings,  
 although vandalism is not a major     
 problem.  The majority of people      
 believe that more local amenities were
 needed and complain about lack of     
 public transport.  A very high        
 proportion of residents have a car but
 older people feel public transport is 
 inadequate.
