		<content> As with many rural areas most of the  
 housing pre-dates the 20th Centuary,  
 but has been much altered and modern- 
 ised.There are some newer houses main-
 ly in Sydenham Damerel but the green  
 belt policy restricts building as the 
 land is agricultural and so there is  
 some conversion of old buildings such 
 as barns into dwellings.Some dwellings
 still retain their own water supply   
 but most have their own sewage dispos-
 al system. Nearly all houses have in- 
 door toilets, bathrooms and hot and   
 cold water supply but a few remain    
 without.These tend to modernised upon 
 change of ownership.There is more home
 ownership than tenancy and no council 
 owned homes.                          
 Information- village and Post Office  
 notice boards in Sydenham. Mobile     
 library calls weekly.
