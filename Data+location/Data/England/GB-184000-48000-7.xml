		<content> My hobby is roller skating.People     
 often start with these,which are four 
 small wheels fitted to a metal        
 plate,attached to your foot.Roller    
 boots are boots which you put put on  
 yourfeet which have the wheels on     
 them.Each boot has four wheels on it  
 and a rubber stopper on the front.When
 you have done up the laces you go     
 outside in them and skate around using
 your arms to keep your balance when   
 you spin and turn corners.These boots 
 are known as roller boots and are     
 common with children in many          
 countries.
