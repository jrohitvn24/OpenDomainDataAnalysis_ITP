		<content> The Dart Valley Railway runs on a     
 single line track between the depot at
 Buckfastleigh and Totnes. It was      
 preserved by local enthusiasts after  
 the threat of closure by the transport
 minister of the 1950's called         
 Dr.Beeching.It carries thousands of   
 tourists on the pictureque riverside  
 route each year,the station at        
 Staverton is a popular stopping point 
 .However this year 1085 passengers    
 travelled from Staverton.The round    
 trip costs an adult Â£2.80 and a child 
 Â£1.80 and takes about an hour.During  
 the height of the tourist season in   
 July and August there are 6 trains    
 every day but there are trains running
 from Easter to September.The station  
 has been used in films such as        
 "Railway Children" and B.B.C. series  
  "Lame Ducks"
