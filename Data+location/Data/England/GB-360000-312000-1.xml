 This is our first page to the Doomsday
 Project.We are covering a rectangle   
 of four by three kilometres at a      
  location of {03600312}.              
  The district contains a few small    
 villages i.e. {Admaston,Rushmoor,     
{Wrockwardine,Bratton}and{Allscott .   
 The area dates back to the 16th       
 century but most buildings have been  
 built in the 20th century.i.e {       
{Admaston estate                       
 Admaston was originally built in{1869 
 and later in the 1900's.              
 In the 1900's Admaston was mostly     
 farms and cattle grazing land.Since   
 then Admaston has grown rapidly.
