		<title>19Tamerton Foliot Naval Estate</title>
		<content> The Naval Estate was built in roughly 
 1963. It was built to house mainly    
 families of the navy and the marines. 
    There are about 400 houses on the  
 Estate.There is a shop called the     
 N.A.A.F.I where you can buy all kinds 
 of things.                            
    People don't live there for many   
 years because they get transferred or 
 they leave and find themselves a      
 council house.The longest you can live
 on the Estate is 11 years then you can
 sign on for another 5 years and in    
 that time you have to find another    
 house.                                
    In our class children from the     
 estate have lived in Portsmouth,Hong  
 Kong,Rosyth,Gibraltar and Singapore.
