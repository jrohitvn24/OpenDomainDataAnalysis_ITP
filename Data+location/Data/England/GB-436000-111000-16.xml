		<content> When we visited a married couple in   
 Stanton Road, the gentleman told us   
 about his job teaching marine         
 engineering &amp; about his hobbies, water
 colour painting, collecting model cars
 and military badges. We found it most 
 interesting. The lady does not have a 
 regular job but she collects very old 
 dolls, sings with a band and is a film
 extra.                                
{Afternoon At Eling}: Yesterday we went
 to St. Mary's church, Eling. After we 
 had been inside we went to have a look
 at the graveyard &amp; then we went to a  
 little beach. I went down the stoney  
 hill &amp; I found some feathers, one big 
 one &amp; the rest little. We climbed a   
 tree &amp; ran down the beach.            
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
