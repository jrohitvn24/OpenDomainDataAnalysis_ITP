		<title>19Parish Council</title>
		<content>  The parish of Potterspury has a      
{Parish Council}made up of 13 people   
 who are elected by the people of the  
 village. The Council elects a Chairman
 and has a paid Clerk who takes the    
 minutes of the Council meetings and   
 keeps the accounts and writes letters.
  The Council is responsible for Street
 Lighting, play areas, planning, mowing
 the grass verges and numerous small   
 jobs. They have recently been planting
 new trees to replace the diseased elm 
 trees. The Council, for the past few  
 years, have distributed bus tokens to 
 the elder residents to help towards   
 the cost of the ever increasing price 
 of bus fares. Another recent project  
 has been the clearing and landscaping 
 of the Cemetery which had fallen into 
 a bad state and was very overgrown and
 neglected.                            
                                       </content>
