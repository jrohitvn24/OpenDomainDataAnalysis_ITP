		<content> Workmen in Louth in '85 have been kept
 busy building a new FineFare          
 supermarket which is to be opened     
 during Autumn of '85. It will affect  
 the town in many ways.We put questions
 to shopkeepers in the town            
 centre to discover their views.Most   
 said it would help their businesses by
 keeping shoppers in town, others      
 thought the building wouldn't affect  
 them. All agreed that the size of the 
 building and parking facilities would 
 attract people to it. The manager of  
 the present Fine Fare explained that  
 security officers would probably be   
 used to combat shoplifting. The new   
 shop would help Louth by creating over
 100 new jobs.The new site is away from
 the main shopping area to allow it to 
 be quite enormous and provide 200     
 parking spaces. Steel girders and     
 traditional red bricks are being used.</content>
