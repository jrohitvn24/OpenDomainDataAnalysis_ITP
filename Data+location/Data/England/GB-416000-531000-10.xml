		<title>10HELMINGTON HALL, HUNWICK</title>
		<content> Helmington Hall is situated in fields 
 for grazing cattle and sheep.It is    
 very large and is built of stone      
 blocks.Inside there is a lounge,a     
 kitchen,six bedrooms and a children's 
 nursery.There are three buildings     
 around it for storing farm            
 machinery.Just below the Hall are 2   
 orchards where apples grow.Helmington 
 Hall now belongs to the Tinkler family
 but in the past it belonged to the    
 Spenser family.Winston Spenser        
 Churchill spent time there as a       
 boy.The Hall is only a tiny fragment  
 of a much larger building built over  
 two hundred years ago.Beside the Hall 
 is an arch called a Norman            
 arch.Beneath it runs a small          
 track.With its sash windows and       
 cobbled yard Helmington Hall overlooks
 a small stream.
