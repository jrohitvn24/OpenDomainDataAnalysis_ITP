		<content>{MAYDAY.                               
  On May the first we have a Mayday    
 ceremony.All the children are dressed 
 in white clothes and the boys carry   
 staffs (a pole decorated with flowers)
 and the girls carry possies.We have a 
 May Queen (who is always eleven years 
 old and is of a local family)She has  
 attendants who are always eleven and  
 seven years old.There are songs sung  
 and the Maypole is danced by the older
 children.The infants also do two      
 dances.After the ceremony the children
 have a special tea laid on for        
 them.Then at seven thirty there is a  
 Mayday disco for the Primary school   
 children only.                        
 Once a year the Primary school        
 children are taken to Samson (an      
 uninhabited island) by the pleasure   
 launches where they spend the day with
 a picnic, before returning home.      </content>
