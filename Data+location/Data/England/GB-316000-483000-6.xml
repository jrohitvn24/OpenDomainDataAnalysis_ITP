		<title>06THE GREEN VILLAGE HALL</title>
		<content> The Village Hall at The Green serves  
 the parish of Thwaites. The hall is   
 about 40 years old. It is used        
 regularly about ten times a week for  
 Brownies, Cubs and other things. The  
 best attended activity is the WI      
 meeting. A committee run the Village  
 Hall and employ a caretaker. It can be
 hired for various functions. Hiring   
 costs are more if you live outside the
 parish. The hall has a well equiped   
 kitchen. There is a main hall,a supper
 room, a snooker and reading room, and 
 toilets. As well as the weekly events 
 the hall is also used less regularly  
 for dances and coffee mornings. There 
 are also annual events. Our survey    
 showed that the best two attended were
 the Gala (64% of those families who   
 replied) and The Sports (45%). some   
 other annual events are The Christmas 
 &amp; Halloween Parties &amp; a New Year Dance</content>
