		<title>02IMPROVING THE DEARNE AREA</title>
		<content> In my opinion to improve our Area     
 is to have more facilities for the    
 younger generation, things like       
{swimming pools and amusements.} I     
 think that our Area should cater for  
 the disabled in buildings like the    
 library in Goldthorpe.   They  have   
 steps to get to the next floors, I    
 think they should have lifts or ramps 
 but the problem is lack of money.     
 In Goldthorpe and Highgate there is a 
 lack of{public toilets.} There are    
 only two public toilets in our Area   
 and these two are too dirty to use;   
 but there again it needs money to     
 build new ones.                       
 In Goldthorpe and Highgate we don't   
 have many{childrens clothes shops. }If
 you want clothes for children you have
 to go to Doncaster  or Mexborough to  
 the bigger clothes stores.
