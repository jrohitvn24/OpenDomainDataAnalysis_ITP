		<title>13TRAFFIC SURVEY (Part 2)</title>
		<content> Another group carried out a survey    
 to find the sex of the driver.  We    
 thought there would be more women     
 drivers during the day, but although  
 the proportion of women drivers       
 increased between l0.30am and         
 12.00noon, there were always more men 
 than women driving (for times as many 
 over the day).                        
 Lorries were found to be most frequent
 during mid morning and mid afternoon, 
 with a very quiet period between      
 ll.30am and 1.00 pm
