		<title>18THATCHING IN ESSEX part 2</title>
		<content>      An average cottage takes around 6
 to 8 weeks to thatch,and would need   
 about{three tons}of{straw.}It would   
 cost about{Â£4000}to rethatch an       
 average cottage,rising to{Â£12,000}for 
 a large roof.                         
      There is a thatcher living at    
 Elder Street,Wimbish.He told us that  
 the only way to become a thatcher is  
 to be{apprenticed}to one.The          
 apprenticeship takes four years.The   
 Elder Street thatcher has one         
 apprentice working with him at the    
 moment.                               
      There is a lot of work for       
 thatchers these days because Local    
 Authorities have a policy of not      
 allowing anyone to remove their       
 thatch.                               
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
