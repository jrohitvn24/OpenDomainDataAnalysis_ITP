		<title>15THE CHURCH</title>
		<content> The church is of Norman origin. Three 
 Norman arches remain today which were 
 built in 1186. Towards the end of the 
 14th century the Norman church was    
 replaced by a perpendicular style of  
 architecture around 1390. There is a  
 story that when Cromwell rode through 
{S.K.}after the battle of Naseby he    
 asked why a statue above the church   
 door had not been destroyed. One of   
 his troopers replied"It is only old   
 Nick sir,so we left him".             
 In the 19th century the rector        
 had an observatory built at{S.K.}He   
 was one of the co-founders of the     
 Royal Astronomical Society.He was also
 responsible for the erection of the   
 church school in 1851 .The school was 
 rebuilt at a cost of Â£225 ,the church 
 was rebuilt except for the tower and  
 Norman arches at a cost of Â£1,850.
