		<title>02BLUE STONE HEATH &amp; BAIN VAL.</title>
		<content>  The landforms of the area are seen as
 the result of glacial &amp; post glacial  
 erosion.                              
  Lower chalk stratas and the under-   
 lying Carstone can be seen at various 
 places along the hill-ridge traversing
 the North of the area.The South-facing
 field slopes show all the sub-soil    
 types,from the chalk ridge, through   
 the Tealby clay and sandstone, down to
 the sand and river gravels of the old 
 river valley.                         
  Deep{Coombs}are found at intervals   
 along this line of hills,caused by the
 ponding-back of glacial melt-water    
 from the still-frozen North Sea as the
 glacial period ended.                 
{ Spring lines}appear along both faces 
 of the valley where water percolating 
 through the chalk, surfaces.{Red Hill 
 (Nature reserve) shows the Cretaceous 
 to Jurassic sequence(Kimmeridge clay).</content>
