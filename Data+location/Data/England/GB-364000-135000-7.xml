		<title>07THE OLD S&amp;D RAILWAY, BRUTON</title>
		<content>    The Somerset and Dorset railway    
was built in 1852 and opened in 1854.  
It started in Burnham on Sea going     
to Glastonbury and then later onto     
Cole in Bruton.Many local business     
men were involved in setting up the    
enterprise,such as James Clark,a       
shoe manufacturer from Street.         
    The line was called the Slow and   
Dirty,as well as the Swift and         
Delightful and was a popular route.    
It shortened the journey from Bristol  
to Plymouth and made it unnecessary    
for steamers nto carry goods around    
the dangerous Lands End.However,the    
railway never made a vast profit,      
simply because it did not carry enough 
traffic.It closed down in 1954 and     
nowadays only the bridges,viaducts     
and old station houses remain,such     
as those seen in area.
