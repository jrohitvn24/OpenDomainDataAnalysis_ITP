		<content> The 160 foot high tower of {Guildford 
{Cathedral}with its golden angel stands
 on the summit of Stag Hill.It is      
 visible from all parts of the town.   
 Dedicated to the Holy Spirit, the     
 Cathedral was designed by{Edward      
{Maufe.}Begun in 1936 the building was 
 consecrated in 1961.The clay excavated
 when 800 piles were driven into the   
 hill was made into the bricks for the 
 exterior.  The Somerset limestone     
 interior is spacious, light and simple
 of decoration. Themes of blue colour, 
 recalling the medieval wool industry  
 and golden stags, recalling the Norman
 hunting grounds appear throughout, as 
 do motifs of the flames of the Holy   
 Spirit and the Dove of Peace. Stained 
 glass windows, carvings and the       
 distinctive kneelers commemorate local
 professions and groups, showing that  
 this is a building for the people.    </content>
