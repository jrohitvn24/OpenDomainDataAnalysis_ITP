		<title>07FIRE RESEARCH STATION</title>
		<content> In 1935 a Furnace Laboratory was      
 opened by the Duke of Kent, and during
 the war their job was to study the    
 effects of large fires in cities. In  
 1947 the{Fire Research Station}was set
 up by the Department of Industrial    
 Research and the insurance companies. 
 It came under the Department of       
 the Environment in 1971. They have a  
 staff of about 130 including graduates
 in physics, chemistry, engineering,   
 mathematics and architecture.         
 Their job is to research all aspects  
 of fire. More than 800 people die in  
 fires in the U.K. every year with some
 600,000 people injured. At the F.R.S. 
 the aim is to minimise these losses.  
 The type of research going on includes
 testing the efficiency of fire        
 extinguishers, furniture etc. Accurate
 reconstructions of major fires are    
 carried out in a hanger on the site.  </content>
