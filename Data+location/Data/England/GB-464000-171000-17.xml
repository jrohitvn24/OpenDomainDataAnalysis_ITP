		<content>    Leisure activities are beginning to
 play a more prominant part in peoples 
 lives though it is difficult to       
 generalise.Many people spend a great  
 deal of their time in front of their  
 television sets.                      
    However,it does seem that for an   
 increasing number of people,they want 
 to participate in more energetic      
 activities.Many people today,both     
 young and old put on their tracksuits 
 and go 'jogging'.Many go running in   
 groups,thus making it a social        
 occasion as well.                     
    All forms of sport,both watching   
 and playing,are enjoyed by all age    
 groups.Having the Meadway Sports      
 Centre and Central Swimming Baths so  
 close means that local people do not  
 have far to go to enjoy superb        
 facilities.
