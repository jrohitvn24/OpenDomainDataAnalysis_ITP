		<title>12MELKSHAM TWINNING</title>
		<content>   Melksham is twinned with Avon in    
 France which is 60km south of Paris.  
 The twinning started in the 1970's.   
 The idea was thought up by Cannon     
 Townsend, who was vicar of            
 St.Michael's church..The people in    
 each town meet once a year.  Each     
 time, about 50 people come over.  It  
 costs about Â£50 to come over to       
 England or go over to France.  There  
 are 2 twin schools in France; the     
 College de la Valee for 11 to 16 year 
 olds, and the Lycee Technique Uruguay 
 France for 16 to 18 year olds.  When  
 the adults come over they stay for a  
 week.  Every time the French people   
 come over they enjoy it a lot.
