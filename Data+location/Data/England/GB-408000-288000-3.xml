		<title>03The Tame Road,Witton.</title>
		<content>The River Tame was the main factor for 
the growth in industry and housing in  
the Tame Road area.There are a large   
number of small factories which use,or 
used,the canal and the main road in the
north,or the rail and new expressway in
the south.There is evidence of many    
changes:-of houses converting to shops;
of large firms becoming smaller;of     
waste land being used for car parks and
new industrial estates,situated behind 
existing factories or housing;and of   
large buildings being converted into   
several small firms,many of which are  
conected with small metal industry.    
Shopping facilities reflect this change
from the video film library to the old 
corner general stores.Two cafes and a  
chip shop in Tame Road itself cater for
the needs of the workers,as well as the
residents.Despite the developments,the 
housing looks clean and well cared for.</content>
