		<content> The village was very self-sufficient  
 having it's own shoe maker and        
 repairer; coal depot; wagonette       
 service; 2 baker and grocery shops;   
 the post office which sold everything 
 from stamps to dress materials, which 
 also baked bread on the premises; 2   
 butcher shops, one of which had a     
 slaughterhouse adjoining; 2 pubs - The
 Portcullis which then had a thatched  
 roof, The Fleece now extended by      
 incorporating the next door cottage;  
 the blacksmiths forge, horses coming  
 from many miles around to be shod.    
 Entertainment was not sitting around  
 watching television, but rehearsing   
 and taking part with the Dramatic     
 Society; the Choral Society; the Band 
 of Hope or concerts held quite often  
 in the school, so all enjoyment was   
 created by everyone so there was no   
 time to be bored.                     </content>
