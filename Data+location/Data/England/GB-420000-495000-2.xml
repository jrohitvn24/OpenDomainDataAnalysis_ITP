		<content> Catterick with Tunstall lies alongside
 the A1 motorway and is a through road 
 to the dales and beyond. At one time  
 the major road of England passed right
 through Catterick but in 1959 a       
 by-pass was built much to the relief  
 of the village folk. Changes had to be
 made in the village itself. A flyover 
 was built to take traffic travelling  
 from Catterick to Tunstall and beyond.
 At Manor House, Catterick a flyover   
 was built solely for the use of farm  
 vehicles and animals. The road from   
 Catterick to East Appleton was blocked
 off and re-routed and resulted in the 
 Weir Bridge being built to staddle the
 stream running from Tunstall and      
 Brough Park through Catterick and into
 the Swale. There are four such bridges
 on this stretch of the stream.
