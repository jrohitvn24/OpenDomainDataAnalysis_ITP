      Most people who live in South    
 Cave are very happy with their        
 village.  During our school holidays  
 we did a questionnaire with the people
 in our neighbourhood. This is what we 
 found.                                
      Many people are commuters and    
 they have their own transport.  They  
 use the few food shops in the village.
 Any large purchases such as clothes or
 furniture are usually made outside of 
 South Cave.  For most of their        
 entertainment, theatre or cinema they 
 must leave the village.  But most     
 families use the Sports Centre for    
 some reason.  A number of people      
 would like to see a swimming pool     
 added to the Sports Centre.           
      The teenagers would like more to 
 do and the younger people would like a
 BMX track.                            </content>
