		<title>07Railway Depot In Ince</title>
		<content>Springs Branch is an important railway 
depot and junction in Lower Ince. Over 
150 men work there, most of them are   
engine drivers. Twenty-three men drive 
Diesel Multiple units on the passenger 
services between Wigan and other N.W.  
towns and cities. Twenty drivers work  
coal trains from nearby collieries to  
Fiddler's Ferry Power Station, Widnes. 
These are known as 'Merry-go-round'    
trains since they go round a loop at   
each end of the line never stopping    
whilst they load or un-load. Thirty    
more men are relief drivers who cover  
for those on holiday or sick. They also
work special services for football     
matches etc. The rest of the drivers   
man express passenger or freight trains
between Crewe and Carlisle. Apart from 
the drivers there are also many guards,
inspectors and maintenance men in the  
huge repair sheds.                     </content>
