		<title>19MINERAL WEALTH OF ST.AGNES</title>
		<content> THE LAND AROUND ST.AGNES IS RICH IN   
 MINERALS. THERE ARE NUMEROUS DERELICT 
 TIN MINES WHICH ONCE WERE THE CENTRE  
 OF A THRIVING COMMUNITY AND THE VERY  
 HUB OF CORNWALL'S PROSPERITY. THE     
 DECLINE IN TIN MINING BEGAN EARLY IN  
 THE 20th CENTURY WITH A DROP IN THE   
 PRICE OF TIN. OTHER MINERALS SUCH AS  
 ARSENIC MADE MINING A VERY UNHEALTHY  
 OCCUPATION. TODAY IN AREAS SUCH AS    
{CLIGGA HEAD}PEOPLE CAN STILL SEE THE  
 RELICS OF THIS INDUSTRY. DERELICT     
 BUILDINGS, CAPPED MINE SHAFTS AND     
 DISUSED QUARRIES COVER THE AREA.      
 WALK ALONG THE{COASTAL FOOTPATH}TO    
 HANOVER COVE, HERE IN THE CLIFF FACE  
 CAN BE SEEN MUCH OF THE MINERAL WEALTH
 OF THE AREA. THE STREAKS OF COLOUR    
 FROM THE TIN AND TOWARDS THE BASE OF  
 THE CLIFF THE TURQUOISE GREEN OF      
 COPPER.                               
                                       </content>
