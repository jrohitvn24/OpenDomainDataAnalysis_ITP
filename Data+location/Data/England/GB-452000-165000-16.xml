		<content>    On the banks of the Kennet and     
 Avon Canal where it passes through    
 the area we looked at flowers and     
 saw Yellow Flag Iris, Daisy, Ivy,     
 Water Lily and Yellow Water Lily.     
 For one of our specimens we picked    
 a Foxglove which is poisonous.        
   As we came down to the canal, we    
 saw two swans, a cob and pen.         
   In the water we saw minnows and     
 a Water Skater. We also saw a snail   
 and a dragonfly, some ants and        
 caterpillars.                         
   We saw some Hawthorn, Ash, Pussy    
 Willow and Alder trees.               
   When we were looking for birds we   
 saw geese, swans, ducks and a moor    
 hen.                                  
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
