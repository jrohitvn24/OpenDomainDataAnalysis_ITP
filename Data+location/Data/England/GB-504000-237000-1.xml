		<title>01HOUSING - MAULDEN AREA</title>
		<content> This block contains the small hamlets 
 of{Haynes West End}and{Water End,}as  
 well as the larger village of{Maulden.
 Originally, we think{Maulden}was a    
 green village, because evidence of a  
 village green  is still visable, but  
 it now resembles a linear development.
 The main industries are related to    
 farming and market gardening, although
 there is some light industry.         
{Traffic}problems through the village  
 have improved since the opening of the
 by-pass in l983. There are regular, if
 infrequent,{bus services}to the nearby
 towns of AMPTHILL and BEDFORD, and the
 M1 MOTORWAY.                          
 The{residents}of the area were        
 interviewed  about their views on life
 locally and were in general very sat- 
 isfied with facilities, although some 
 stressed the need for local{medical   
{care.}                                </content>
