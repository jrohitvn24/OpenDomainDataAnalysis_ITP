		<title>18A LOCAL TEACHER</title>
		<content> I am an assistant teacher at the      
 Humberston Infants School. I am       
 married with two children. My         
 husband is a telephone engineer. I    
 teach a class of twenty-one children; 
 boys and girls of five years old,in   
 all subjects. I travel to school in my
 car bringing with me my daughter,aged 
 twelve and my son aged eleven. They   
 each then walk to their own schools.  
 I go home at lunch-time and have time 
 for some local shopping or some house-
 work. After school I occupy myself    
 with jobs in school whilst I wait for 
 my children,one of whom is usually    
 involved in an after-school activity. 
 We arrive home at five o'clock and I  
 cook a dinner for us all.             
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
