		<title>12PITSFORD CONVENT</title>
		<content> THIS CONVENT WAS FOUNDED IN 1947 BY AN
 ORDER OF NUNS KNOWN AS "THE HOLY      
 FAMILY OF NAZARETH".                  
 IT WAS DESIGNED TO CATER FOR THE NEEDS
 OF POLISH CHILDREN ARRIVING IN THIS   
 AREA OF ENGLAND IN THE AFTERMATH OF   
 THE 1939-1945 WAR IN EUROPE.          
 THE PRIMARY FUNCTION OF THE CONVENT   
 WAS AS A BOARDING SCHOOL WHOSE ROLL   
 NUMBERS VARIED BETWEEN 100 AND 200    
 CHILDREN. ALL WERE TAUGHT ACADEMIC    
 SUBJECTS IN THE POLISH LANGUAGE.      
 PRODUCE, IN THE FORM OF FRUIT, FLOWERS
 AND VEGETABLES HAVE ALWAYS BEEN GROWN 
 IN THE EXTENSIVE CONVENT GARDENS.     
 SINCE 1965 THE SISTERS HAVE PROVIDED A
 SATURDAY SCHOOL FOR CHILDREN OF POLISH
 EXTRACTION WHO LIVE IN THE AREA AND   
 WISH TO LEARN THE POLISH LANGUAGE.    
 BOARDING EDUCATION IS NO LONGER       
 AVAILABLE BUT THE TWELVE RESIDENT     
 SISTERS CONTINUE THEIR EDUCATION ROLE.</content>
