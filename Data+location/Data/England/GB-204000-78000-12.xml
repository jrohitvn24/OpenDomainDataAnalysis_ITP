		<content> DESPITE THE RECENT GROWTH IN          
 POPULATION, THERE HAS BEEN A DECLINE  
 IN THE NUMBER AND QUALITY OF SERVICES 
 AND AMENITIES IN THE VILLAGE. THIRTY  
 YEARS AGO ST. TEATH BOASTED TWO       
 GENERAL STORES, TWO SHOEMAKERS, A     
 NEWSAGENT, A BUTCHER, A FISHMONGER, A 
 CO-OP STORE, A BARBER, A MILLINER, A  
 BLACKSMITH, A GARAGE AND PETROL       
 STATION AND A BAKERS ROUND THREE TIMES
 A WEEK. NOW THERE ARE ONLY FOUR SHOPS;
 THE POST OFFICE AND GENERAL STORES;   
 NEWSAGENT AND GREENGROCER; A BUTCHER  
 AND CONFECTIONER. THE GARAGE NO LONGER
 SELLS PETROL AND THE BAKER COMES ONLY 
 ONCE A WEEK. NEVERTHELESS, ALTHOUGH   
 ACCESS TO THE BIGGER STORES IN        
 NEIGHBOURING TOWNS IS NOW POSSIBLE BY 
 LOCAL BUS SERVICES, MOST VILLAGERS    
 PREFER  TO DO THEIR SHOPPING IN       
 ST.TEATH WHERE PERSONAL SERVICE AND   
 FRIENDLINESS ARE MUCH APPRECIATED.    </content>
