 Tipton is in the heart of the Black   
 Country,with many factories and steel 
 works,but many of the factories are   
 closing down because of the economic  
 recession.It is not surprising that   
 there is nearly 20% unemployment in   
 this area.There are some very skilled 
 people who, because of the economic   
 situation are stuck at home.The{houses
 in Tipton are mainly Victorian and    
 because of their age are in bad       
 repair.This is a problem, since  fewer
 houses are being built because people 
 cannot afford to buy them.            
 Many{shops}are closing down because   
 people only buy essential goods,and   
 cannot afford luxury items. Shops are 
 not making money like they did in the 
 past,and with bills so high it is not 
 surprising that so many are closing   
 down.                                 </content>
