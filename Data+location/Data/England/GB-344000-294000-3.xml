		<title>03FARMIMG IN ALL STRETTON</title>
		<content>   There are{nine farms}in our block.  
 Most of the land is good. The Western 
 side is shale and the Eastern side    
 across the by-pass is boulder clay.   
 Very few fields are ploughed and most 
 land is{grassland}used for grazing or 
 for hay. The higher land is rough     
 pasture with common grazing on the    
 Long Mynd. Some land is marshy.       
   Most of the farms in the valley are 
 dairy farms and some also keep sheep. 
 Only two farms grow some corn.        
  {Old Hall farm is the oldest farm in 
{the village.}It is a black and white  
 timbered house built about the        
 beginning of the{sixteenth century.}  
 Old Hall Farm is 120 acres which is   
 about average for the area. The farmer
 has 45 dairy cows but no sheep or     
 chickens. He has some farm machinery  
 but employs a contractor for hay      
 harvest.                              </content>
