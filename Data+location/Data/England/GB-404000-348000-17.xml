		<title>17Our Houses</title>
		<content>65% of the children in Waterhouses     
Middle School live in a village. 21%   
of the children live in houses which   
have only a few other houses around    
them. 3.5% live in public houses.      
Most of the houses are made of either  
limestone or sandstone. Most of us live
in detached houses. Some of us live in 
ordinary houses and some in farmhouses,
bungalows and cottages but some        
children have more unusual homes:      
Lisa lives in a caravan while her      
parents are changing one of the old    
village schools into a house. Damon's  
house was once a pig sty and farm      
buildings. David's house used to be a  
chapel. The main problem in converting 
it was dividing up the large space into
rooms. Tracey's house was once a       
railway signal man's house but there is
no railway now.
