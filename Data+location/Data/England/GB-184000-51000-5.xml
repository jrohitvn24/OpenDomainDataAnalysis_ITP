		<content> Trewaters Farm, on junction of 1,2,5  
 and 6 consists of 130 acres           
 (approximately 22 acres being         
 scrub-type woodland) owned jointly by 
 the Farmer and his uncle.  The        
 farmhouse is used for letting         
 purposes.  The modern bunglow (1) is  
 owned by one of the Farmers employees.
 There are a number of farm Buildings  
 viz- Old-type cattle sheds, a new shed
 to hold 100 calves, a dutch barn, a   
 grain bin with 100 tons capacity, and 
 a shed for the combine harvester and  
 other machinery.  The farmer keeps    
 about 140 calves on set stocking plan 
 and 100 ewes and lambs each year.  60 
 acres are in corn.  Three full-time   
 men are employed to work with the     
 farmer on a total of 430 acres (two   
 other farms with this one) and all    
 modern machinery is used.  A spring   
 supplies the farm and bungalows water.</content>
