		<title>14Norwood Manor, Eastchurch</title>
		<content>       Norwood Manor, first known as   
 Northwood Manor, was built in 1126 and
 remained a feature of the{local       
{history}until it was destroyed in     
{Cromwell's time}resulting in the      
 building of the present{manor}house in
 about 1670.                           
       There is no record after the    
 restoration but it is known that it   
 has been continuously occupied through
 the years.                            
       Since the nineteenth century it 
 has been a{farm}and remains so today. 
 When damaged during the Second World  
 War many of the original features were
 revealed.                             
       It is thought that most of the  
 farms in the area once belonged to the
 manor. At present Norwood is owned by 
 a syndicate who farm the land whilst  
 the farmhouse is occupied by a        
 previous employee.                    </content>
