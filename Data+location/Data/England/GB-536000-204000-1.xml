		<content> Lower Nazeing                         
 Our area that surrounds Lower Nazeing 
 is predominantly agricultural, mainly 
 of the type of farming known as Market
 Gardening, that is growing crops such 
 as salad crops like tomatoes, lettuce 
 as well as producing flowers. Running 
 through the area that we covered is   
 part of the Lea (or Lee) Valley Park  
 which is a recreational area used for 
 activities such as fishing, sailing as
 well as walking.                      
 Much of the countryside is of a       
 rolling nature more typical of the    
 South Downs in Southern England. The  
 gravel workings, some of which are no 
 longer used, are integrated into the  
 Lee Valley Park.                      
 Lower Nazeing is some eight miles from
 the town of Harlow, which is found to 
 the east, and some four miles from    
 Hoddesdon.                            </content>
