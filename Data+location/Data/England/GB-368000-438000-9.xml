		<content>   There is quite a lot of farming in  
 this area,and a plantation forest in  
 the north-west corner.                
   The main area is used for grazing or
 for growing grass for silage or hay.  
 Silage is cut and stored fresh in     
 enclosures, but grass for hay needs   
 drying before being made into bales   
 which are stored in barns. Most of the
 cattle are dairy cattle, but some are 
 kept for beef.The silage and hay are  
 kept for the cows to eat in winter    
 when they are stall fed.              
   Sheep graze in this area, but the   
 main sheep grazing area is west of    
 Stonyhurst College.The sheep are      
 sheared once a year and the wool sent 
 off to make clothes.The lambs are     
 slaughtered for meat.
