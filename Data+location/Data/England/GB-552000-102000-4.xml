		<title>04Farming on the South Downs</title>
		<content> Church Farm is typical of the farming 
 on the South Downs. It is a farm of   
 approximately 1900 acres. The land    
 varies in height from 2 metres to 152 
 metres. The majority of the farm is on
 the Chalk Downland although parts of  
 it are on the clay soils of the       
 Cuckmere Valley.                      
                                       
 Mixed farming is carried out. The     
 farmer has 800 acres of corn and      
 about 50 acres of oil seed rape.      
 The rest of the land is kept for      
 grass. There are 90 dairy cows, 600   
 young stock and 150 yews.             
                                       
 The farmer favours keeping cattle     
 rather than sheep because he can fence
 them in more easily,although there is 
 a gradual move back to sheep farming.
