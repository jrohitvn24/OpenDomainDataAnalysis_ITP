		<title>05HARESHAW LYNN</title>
		<content>  Hareshaw Lynn is an attractive{valley
 near Bellingham. Visitors like to     
 follow the Hareshaw Burn up to the {  
{waterfall}which is about ten metres   
 high.                                 
  The path winds its way along the {   
{stream}for one and a half miles       
 across six bridges through three gates
 and past four resting benches.Many    
 species of{flowers}and {wild life}can 
 be seen during the four seasons.      
  The Lynn(waterfall) is enclosed by   
 trees and surrounded by a strong fence
 which keeps out straying animals.     
  In the olden days people used to put 
 their best clothes on and go to the   
 Lynn to listen to a band which played 
 in a clearing near the last bridge.   
  Now it is sometimes used for nature  
 trails whan people can follow a       
 planned route leaning as they go. It  
 is a pleasant walk all year round.    </content>
