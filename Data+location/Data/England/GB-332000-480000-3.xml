		<content>   Up until quite recently{peat}was cut
 in this area.The peat was left to dry 
 and used as a fuel.A railway line or  
 path which was raised above the swampy
 level was built to transport the peat.
 The peat swamps consisting of decayed 
 plants are still plentiful today.     
 Some tales exist about people taking  
 a short cut across the marshes to     
{Greenodd,}a nearby village.Some of    
 these people were never seen again,   
 and are presumed to have drowned in   
 the sinking mud.                      
   The marshes contain a{nature reserve
 to protect nature in the area.The     
 marsh land is dangerous and should    
 only be crossed via public footpaths. 
 Plants that are evident include       
 mosses,rhododendron bushes and silver 
 birch trees.There is also evidence    
 that adders,rabbits and squirrels     
 inhabit this area.                    </content>
