		<title>01Introduction, Richmond area.</title>
		<content>  Standing as it does some 50 miles    
 equidistant from{York, Leeds}and      
{Newcastle}, and only 3 miles from     
 the A1, the area is well positioned.  
  Within the area itself the contrasts 
 are striking. On the one hand we have 
 the magnificent sweep of the{R. Swale 
 as it tumbles over the falls below the
 impressive walls of ancient{Richmond  
{Castle}, on the other the military    
 starkness of the neatly laid-out      
 barracks of{Catterick Garrison}.Then  
 there are the lovely ruins of{Easby   
{Abbey}and the wooded slopes of the    
 river valley.  The land itself is rich
 and many crops are grown, including   
 potatoes and cereals, but it is mainly
 good grazing land dotted with         
 attractive woods containing a pleasing
 variety of trees. The main areas of   
 population are{Richmond, Catterick    
{Garrison, Colburn}and{Hipswell.   }   </content>
