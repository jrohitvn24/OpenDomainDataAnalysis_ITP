		<content>    The crops grown in our block are   
 wheat, barley, corn,potatoes,sugar    
 beet, peas and oil seed rape. The land
 is very good for growing crops,       
 irrigation water is pumped from the   
 river by tractor driven pumps. The    
 hedges have been pulled up making room
 for more modern machinery.   Nitram,  
 Tillage, pot ash and lime are the     
 fertilizers used for making crops grow
 better and produce more per acre.  A  
 new crop called linseed oil which     
 some farmers are thinking of growing  
 next year                             
    The animals around here are mostly 
 bullocks,sheep and pigs,and for eggs  
 chickens are kept. Horses are kept    
 to get money by entering competitions.
