		<title>08Sennen School</title>
		<content> Sennen School is the first and last   
 school in England.The school building 
 is dated in 1880 but was not opened   
 until 3rd January 1881.The first      
 headmaster was Mr.Job Cockcroft.At    
 that time the school had three        
 classrooms including a mixed one. They
 did not have a school kitchen so we   
 think they must have had a packed     
 lunch or had gone home for lunch.Our  
 headmaster is now Mr.Cooper.The school
 has changed a lot since 1880 because  
 we have now got a school kitchen and  
 in 1980 we had a new toilet block     
 built onto the old building.          
 We have got three classrooms junior   
 1,junior 2 and infants.There is an    
 adventure playground next to the      
 school and we use that.There is a     
 community centre behind the school and
 we do our P.E in that if we cant do it
 on the school field.                  </content>
