		<title>08A Profile of Mr. Shepherd</title>
		<content>Mr. Shepherd is a keen gardener. He    
also does extra jobs to earn a little  
bit more money. He owns a tractor in   
which he moves about in. He has a very 
large garden with plenty of flowers and
vegetables. The vegetables he grows are
Runner Beans, Broad Beans, Peas and    
Spinach. If you look at his flowers and
vegetables you can see how well he     
looks after them. Round near the back  
of his garden he grows raspberries and 
apple trees. In the front he has a     
labernan tree and holly bushes. Because
of all the flowers and other things he 
attracts lots of wildlife. He has a    
Shepherd Dog who goes with him wherever
he goes.
