		<title>04OPENCAST MINING AT IBSTOCK</title>
		<content>   Between the villages of{Ibstock,    
{Heather and Ravenstone}lies an        
 open_cast coal mine covering 182      
 hectares and producing one million    
 tonnes of coal per year.              
   Coal is found 20_30 metres below the
 surface and is being mined to a depth 
 of 85 metres.                         
   Every day, 20,000 tonnes of coal are
 extracted by mechanical excavators. It
 is taken by lorry to be crushed and   
 then moved by conveyor belt to the    
 South Leicestershire Colliery at      
 Ellistown.                            
   From there the coal goes directly by
 train to the Trent Valley power       
 stations. It can be at its destination
 within hours of being mined.          
   The site provides 150 jobs and has  
 reserves until 1990.
