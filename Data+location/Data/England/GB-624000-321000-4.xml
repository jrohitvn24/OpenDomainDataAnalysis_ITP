		<content> Most of the parish of Scottow lies    
 outside this particular D-BLOCK.      
 However the Church, the Hall and the  
 Hall Farm are in the area. They are   
 all situated in woodland to the north 
 of the airfield at R.A.F. Coltishall  
 and the airfield has in fact divided  
 the village in two.                   
{The Hall}is a large house built       
 mainly in the Georgian style though   
 there are traces of other periods.    
{The church}is dedicated to All Saints 
 and is a large building and is in want
 of repair.                            
 A small commuinity live around the    
 church and Hall. Most of the          
 inhabitants work as agricultural      
 workers.
