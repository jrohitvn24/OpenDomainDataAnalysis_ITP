		<title>06FARMING ON THE VALLEY FLOOR</title>
		<content>   The{Trent Valley}has{variable soils}
 from sandy to clay,sometimes in the   
 same field,because of the way the     
 local nature of the currents of the   
 post ice-age slowing waters affected  
 the deposition of the suspended mater-
 ials.Skilful management means that    
 good crops are grown.{Oil seed rape}  
 seems now to predominate but there is 
 still plenty of{wheat}and{barley.Sugar
{ beet}and a few{potatoes}are grown.   
 There are some fields of cultivated   
 grass for hay and,fortunately,there   
 are a few long standing{meadows}where 
{cowslips}bloom.The grazing{cows}      
 ,mainly Freisian,are for{beef.}       
   Strangely enough,there are not many 
 clear-cut farms - Manor Farm of 100   
 acres,Bleasby being an exception.Many 
 fields are owned or worked by         
 outsiders for themselves or on behalf 
 of minor owners who are not farmers.  </content>
