		<title>03EMPLOYMENT IN FLEETWOOD 1985</title>
		<content>    From using survey questionnaires   
 and interviews on five separate       
 occasions with Fleetwood residents and
 visitors, we found that of residents  
 questioned 20% commented, unprompted, 
 on the loss of jobs in the fishing    
 industry and in shipping, 75% thought 
 that unemployment was a major problem 
 in Fleetwood and 55% that unemployment
 had increased during the past two     
 years.                                
    Asked to name the town's main      
 source of work, 60% said I.C.I., 12%  
 said Pandoro, 16% said the docks or   
 the container berth, 4% said in-shore 
 fishing, and 8% said there was none,  
 just unemployment.                    
    Despite an awareness of Fleetwood's
 problems, 48% commented on the recent 
 and current work to improve the sea   
 wall, Marina, town centre and Park.   
 They believe in their motto:{ONWARD}. </content>
