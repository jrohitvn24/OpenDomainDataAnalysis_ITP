		<title>16Buntingford - Newspapers</title>
		<content> The Buntingford area is served by two 
 newspapers, The Hertfordshire Mercury 
 and the Royston Crow (properly called 
 the Herts and Cambs Reporter and      
 Royston Crow). Neither is truly local 
 to Buntingford, as the Mercury covers 
 a very wide area, hiding Buntingford  
 amongst many other villages, whilst   
 many Buntingford people themselves do 
 not read the"Crow" because they feel  
 remote from Royston!                  
                                       
 In recent years, a new publication has
 emerged, especially for Buntingford   
 people. It is called "The Buntingford 
 Journal" and is printed monthly. The  
 journal is quite small, more a        
 magazine than a paper, but it does    
 give very good coverage to local      
 events. Most local people read it.
