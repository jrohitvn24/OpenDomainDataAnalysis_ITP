		<content> Housing Survey.                       
  A survey of local buildings was      
 carried out in 2 areas close to G.C.  
 school. Both areas consist largely of 
 modern post-war property but one is   
 dominated by council-owned houses     
 (with some recent private             
 purchases)whilst the other comprises  
 privately-owned housing. The aims of  
 the survey were 1.to assess the       
 condition &amp; state of repair of        
 property. 2.to observe the  building  
 materials, number of rooms &amp; size of  
 house. 3.toassess the provision of    
 local amenities such as parks &amp; play  
 areas.4.to check the provision of     
 gardens &amp; open space.                 
 Areas Surveyed.                       
  1.Spring Lane Estate.                
 The houses here are almost entirely   
 post-war(1945-1955) with some recent  
 additions built during the 1970's.    </content>
