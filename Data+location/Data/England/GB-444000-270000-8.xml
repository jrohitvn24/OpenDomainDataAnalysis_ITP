		<content>   Pipewell cottage is owned by an     
 hospitable lady. Her house in         
 Thurlaston is attractive and was      
 built about 600 years ago. It was     
 originally three cottages.  The house 
 was named after monks from            
 Northampshire who apparenly had a well
 nearby. It was made in cruck          
 construction with wattle and daub.    
 It became the gardeners cottage to the
 local manor.Seven evacuees hid there  
 in world war ll  living in the room at
 the end of the house.                 
   Near the bridge entering the village
 there once was an 8ft common churchway
 between Thurlaston and Dunchurch for  
 the bearers at funerals, there being  
 no church yard at Thurlaston. In the  
 last ten years this has been covered  
 by new detached homes called the      
 Gardens.
