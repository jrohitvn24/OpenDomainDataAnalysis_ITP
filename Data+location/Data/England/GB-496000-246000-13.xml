		<title>13Village Life,The Blacksmith</title>
		<content> There has been a Blacksmith on this   
 site since the 1870's.The present     
 business has been here 35 years, the  
 blacksmith now working alone since his
 father retired.                       
 The building is original and remains  
 unchanged,apart from there being only 
 1 hearth (was 2) which now has an     
 electric blower-but the large bellows 
 can still be seen hanging from the    
 ceiling.                              
 Agriculltural repairs (Straightening  
 bent and mending broken equipment) are
 the biggest part of his work during   
 summer months.He makes firebaskets and
 firedogs,gates weather vanes, brackets
 and other ornamental work in the      
 winter months for sale during the     
 year.He often makes implements to     
 order such as a buck rake and bag     
 lifter.                               
                                       </content>
