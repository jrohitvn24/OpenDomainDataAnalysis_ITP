 Sometimes on Sundays during the light 
 evenings we go to Whitley Bay. We buy 
 some chips and an ice-cream and look  
 at the ships passing by. When we have 
 eaten our chips we get in the car and 
 count how many different car          
 registrations we can see on the way   
 back.                                 
 On Sundays if it is a nice day we go  
 out to Hexham Green. We often see     
 ducks and fish jumping out of the     
 water. We often find golf balls lying 
 about in the grass.                   
 On Saturdays my grandparents Michael  
 and I go to Bywell. When we get to the
 river we see Mallard ducks and little 
 fish. I once saw a kestrel and a stoat
 and herons flying over.               
 My friend Paul and I go for walk with 
 a snack. We see rabbits and pheasants.</content>
