		<title>20OLD AND NEW IN CHURCHDOWN</title>
		<content>  There are several different building 
 types in Churchdown,both old houses   
 and new estates.An example of an      
 original village house is situated on 
 the green.It dates from 1581 and is   
 black and white and is made mainly of 
 "wattle and daub",although some of the
 newer parts are built with bricks.The 
 roof was originally thatched but is   
 now tarred and tiled.It contains 8    
 rooms and has approx. a quarter of an 
 acre of land around it.               
  An example of a modern estate house  
 is situated on Brookfield Road        
 opposite Chosen Hill School.It was    
 built in 1984 and is built entirely   
 of bricks.Its roof is pitched with    
 tiles.It is fairly large with 12 rooms
 consisting of 4 bedrooms ,a large     
 kitchen plus other rooms.
