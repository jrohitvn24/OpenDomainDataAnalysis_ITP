		<title>09THE VILLAGE OF OUSTON</title>
		<content> The village of{OUSTON}has been        
 growing since the early 1960's from   
 the original pit village based on the 
 local colliery (long since closed) to 
 a large modern residential area of    
 some{TWO THOUSAND}homes.The older     
 surviving properties in and around {  
{THE BROOMS}and{NORTH VIEW}(many of    
 which are still rented from the local 
 authority) effectively form a central 
 hub around which the newer and almost 
 without exception the privately owned 
 properties have been built.           
  The first phase of development by the
 Newcastle based firm of WILLIAM LEECH 
 - the{WENTWORTH PARK estate}- is now  
 some 20 years old. The most recent    
 development - the{GRANGE VILLAGE      
{complex}- is still being built and    
 should complete the whole project in  
 the near future.
