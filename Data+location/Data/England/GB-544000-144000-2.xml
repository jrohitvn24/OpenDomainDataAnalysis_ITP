		<content>    The town actually got its name from
 river Eden which runs through the town
 centre. Nearby villages are Marlpit   
 Hill, Marsh Green, Lingfield, Four    
 Elms, Hever, Chiddingstone, Cowden and
 Bough Beech.                          
    Education in the town is organised 
 on a three_tier basis. There are six  
 First Schools in Edenbridge and the   
 outlying villages. At nine years old  
 the children transfer to the          
 Middle School in the town and at      
 thirteen move to the Upper School,    
 Eden Valley. It is still possible to  
 sit the 11+ examination and if        
 successful, one can transfer to the   
 Grammar Schools in Tonbridge and      
 Tunbridge Wells. There are also       
 private fee_paying schools in the     
 area....by Ilsa Reynolds.
