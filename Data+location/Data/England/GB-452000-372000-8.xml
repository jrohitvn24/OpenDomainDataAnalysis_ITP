 Most of the land in this area is      
 farmland, and most of this farmland is
 arable land which is under            
 cultivation. The main crops grown are 
 barley, wheat, potatoes, sugar beet   
 and oilseed rape.                     
 However, a fair amount of livestock is
 reared on the farms. There are several
 fields of fertilised grassland which  
 is cut for silage and hay and fed to  
 the animals. Several more fields are  
 enclosed rough grazing land, used as  
 pasture.                              
 It appears to be a very fertile area  
 with a light sandy soil that it very  
 productive.                           
 Even the old pit tips have been       
 contoured, covered in soil and        
 cultivated. Most is used as pasture,  
 but one farmer has grown a crop of    
 barley on an old pit tip.             </content>
