		<title>12FARMING, HASELOR, WARKS.</title>
		<content> I went to ask Mr.Goulbourne about his 
 farming. He has a fairly large dairy  
 herd. He and his dairyman milk the    
 cows twice a day. The cows come into  
 the milking parlour and most of them  
 like to have the same milking bay each
 time. His cows have coloured tapes on 
 their tails,these indicate how much   
 milk the cow gives and that cow is    
 given a quantity of cow cake as it is 
 being milked;the more milk it gives   
 the more cake it has. Mr.Goulbourne   
 also keeps turkeys to fatten them up  
 for Christmas. Just before Christmas  
 he employs local people to come to    
 pluck and dress the turkeys. Some he  
 sends to the local markets others he  
 sells to his regular customers who    
 order their Christmas turkey from him 
 each year. He says that turkeys are   
 very nervous creatures. He grows some 
 crops to feed his own livestock.      </content>
