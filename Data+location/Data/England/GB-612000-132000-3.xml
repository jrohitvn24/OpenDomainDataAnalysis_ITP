		<content>   Most of the days in my life are     
 exactly the same. In the mornings I   
 get up and have my breakfast. Then I  
 get dressed and go to school. I find  
 that the evenings are what make them  
 different; for instance Mondays I have
 rounders after school and Brownies    
 which are good fun. Tuesdays I have   
 athletics, then on Wednesdays I have  
 recorders and modern dance at the     
 local secondary school. On Thursday I 
 have country dancing and after that I 
 go to Guides. We do things like papier
 mache and we play games; we also have 
 special uniforms to wear. On Friday   
 evening I have a tap class which is   
 run by a lady called Mrs Frankley. She
 is a very kind lady and is good at tap
 Saturday mornings there is no school  
 and at 10.30 I have my Ballet class   
 which is very good. Sunday is my only 
 day off which I spend with my family. </content>
