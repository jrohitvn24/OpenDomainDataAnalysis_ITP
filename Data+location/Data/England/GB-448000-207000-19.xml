		<content>  The school that Mr.Twining went to,  
was in George Street.Schools were much 
stricter then.Everybody was afraid of  
the Headmaster.The cane was used often.
Every day started with Assembly and    
Scripture readings.During the day the  
pupils stayed in their classrooms and  
the teachers moved for the different   
lessons.                               
  At school Mr. Twining wore a tie,    
shorts and a brown blazer.When he was  
older he wore trousers.                
  Buildings have changed a lot since   
Mr.Twining was a boy.Where the shops in
Summertown are, there used to be a row 
of small cottages.Where St.Gregory's   
school is, there used to be allotments.
  Prices have changed too.In the 1920's
a Baby Austin could be bought for 100  
pounds and petrol was 5p a gallon.     
Horse-drawn trams travelled up the     
bumpy roads.                           </content>
