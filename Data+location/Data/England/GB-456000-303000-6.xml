		<title>06Leicester's Mr Elvis</title>
		<content> Mick Haywood's fascination with{Elvis 
{Presley}began in 1956. Everything     
 about Elvis excited Mick. So Mick     
 began to copy the way Elvis looked,   
 and ever since has devoted all his    
 spare time to Elvis's music and rock'n
 roll. Now Mick and his wife live at   
 the{House of Elvis,}on Hawthorne      
 Street with their daughter Lisa, named
 after Elvis's daughter. Over the years
 Mick has acquired a vast amount of    
 Elvis memorabilia, including videos of
 every film and major concert in which 
 Elvis has appeared. Since Elvis's     
 death in 1977, Mick and his wife have 
 converted their attic into a shrine to
 house their Elvis collection. Mick has
 taken part in radio and TV shows about
 Elvis, and his Elvis collection has   
 been on public display. Their pet dog 
 is named Princess Marie of Memphis in 
 honour of Elvis's daughter.           </content>
