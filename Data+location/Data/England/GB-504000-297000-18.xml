		<title>18WANSFORD AREA WALKS</title>
		<content>  The rural area around the villages of
 Wansford and Yarwell is a perfect     
 location for walkers.                 
  The landscape is almost flat,        
 providing easy walking country, but it
 contains a wide variety of scenery    
 which makes for interesting walks:    
 The many footpaths which traverse the 
 area take the walker across fields;   
 through villages, forests and         
 woodlands; beside quarries; near      
 historic buildings, roman             
 remains and ancient monuments; along  
 river banks and across rivers by means
 of bridges, fords and stepping stones.
  In addition to the public footpaths  
 there are also bridleways and many    
 quiet country roads which provide a   
 relatively traffic free environment   
 for walkers.
