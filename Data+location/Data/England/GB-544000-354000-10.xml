		<content> Beet harvesting and wheat drilling are
 on today's programme. The contractor  
 arrived yesterday and he needs 2      
 tractors and carts to take the beet   
 from the harvester to the heap. Also 1
 man is needed to tidy the heap and    
 load the lorry from the other heap as 
 we have 2 permits. The remaining 3 men
 are needed for drilling the wheat to  
 follow last year's potatoes and       
 sugar beet.One will be ploughing,     
 another cultivating and the third     
 drilling and harrowing afterwards.    
 Later the field will be top dressed   
 with fertilizer and then a herbicide  
 applied to control wild oats and      
 weeds. The potato store which was     
 filled recently needs checking to     
 ensure that it is not overheating. The
 fan in the corn store might need to be
 used as it is a dry day. Tomorrow will
 be another busy autumn day.           </content>
