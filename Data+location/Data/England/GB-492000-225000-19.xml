		<title>19LOCAL FARMING 2.</title>
		<content> Many of the farms have most of thier  
 land for grazing as most keep a       
 variety of stock although in all cases
 one type of animal is the priority    
 stock. Wheat is grown by most of the  
 farmers on a relatively large scale   
 and all cropgrass for silage making.  
 Despite this enabling the farmers to  
 provide for the stock over winter, the
 majority still make hay and the       
 traditional shaped bale is the most   
 popular still, with none apparently   
 using the new cylinder shapes now     
 often seen in fields. Most have a     
 considerable range of mechanised      
 equipment e.g. tractors, combine      
 harvesters, balers, ploughs, sprayers,
 mowers, drills etc., which help       
 enormously in the man hours necessary 
 to work the farms. However each farmer
 stressed that even in 1985 farming is 
 still very hard work.                 </content>
