		<content> Of the two dozen properties in        
 Collingbourne Kingston approx. two    
 thirds are tied houses the remainder  
 being privately owned. Due south of   
 Collingbourne Kingston is an are of 24
 Council properties known as The Knapp,
 and to the west of this is a private  
 estate of 12 bungalows known as Sunny 
 Hill. Some of the council properties  
 have recently been purchased by the   
 long standing tenants.                
 Of the 45 residential properties      
 in Everleigh only a small percentage  
 are tied and council housing for the  
 elderly.                              
 All houses have mains electricity,    
 water and sewerage, Everleigh boasting
 its own American built sewage works,  
 but no mains gas supply exists in the 
 area. The water supply for both       
 villages comes from their own deep    
 artesian wells.                       </content>
