		<content>   The {Abbey Church}of the Benedictine
 monastry grew up on the site where    
{St.Alban}was probably buried. The     
 remains of the marble {shrine,}the    
 heart of the mediaeval church, is     
 still visited by{pilgrims}today.      
   The {nave}is the longest in England 
 and the {Norman Tower}contains Roman  
 bricks from Verulamium. Every century 
 has added more to the building which  
 was restored by Lord Grimthorpe in the
 19th Century and became a {Cathedral  
 in 1877. It has a {parish }as well    
 as a {diocese}and large,lively        
 congregations. There are three        
 services a day and many weddings and  
 baptisms. The {music }is provided by a
 choir and organ. There is a biennial  
 organ{festival }and many concerts.
