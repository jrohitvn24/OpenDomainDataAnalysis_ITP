		<title>03PARISH COUNCIL</title>
		<content> The Parish Council is made up of 6    
 elected members of the community &amp;  a 
 secretary. It meets every month &amp; the 
 public may attend but not             
 participate.The main function of the  
 council is to maintain the smooth     
 running of the village. It can        
 register protest against bad planning,
 inadequate care of roads &amp;            
 footpaths,reckless cutting down of    
 trees, but it has no authority to     
 enforce improvements. This must come  
 from the Test valley  District        
 Council. The Parish Council has       
 recently approved the planting of     
 trees round the playing field. It has 
 saved a valuable woodland area        
 from being felled. Every year         
 it is allocated Â£1500 from the Borough
 for improvements in the village.
