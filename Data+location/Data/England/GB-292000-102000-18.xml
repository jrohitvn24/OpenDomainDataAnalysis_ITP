		<title>18    Jumbo  Jet accident</title>
		<content>    On Sunday 23rd of June 1985, Jumbo 
 Jet flight 182 vanished from the sky  
 and radar screens. Eight minutes      
 before that the aeroplane was reported
 perfectly alright but then the plane  
 plunged towards the Atlantic Ocean.   
 Scientists were not sure whether the  
 plane broke up in mid air or just     
 fell. Wreckage was spread over more   
 than 5 miles. Nobody knows for sure   
 what caused the "BLAST" but most      
 people reckon that a bomb was the     
 most likely cause.                    
    The speed of the plane was 600mph  
 and had it not been delayed it would  
 have arrived at Heathrow Airport which
 might have caused more deaths than the
 329 people killed already. Over 100   
 bodies have been recovered so far,and 
 parents and relatives are going to    
 identify the bodies tomorrow.
