		<title>02Brackley's local news.</title>
		<content>   A sneakthief escaped from a local   
estate agent's office with cash and    
cheques. Police think he entered       
through an insecure back door at about 
1.05p.m. on Friday but he left when he 
was disturbed by staff.                
Brackley Park slide was to be          
removed because it did not pass        
British Safety Regulations. A          
councillor said that the advice to     
get rid of it was  over-reaction. He   
said that it could  be fixed for five  
pounds and it could  have a bank       
against it for extra safety.           
   A lady-in-waiting to Princess       
Margaret visited Brackley to           
celebrate 75 years of Guides. She lit  
the birthday cake candles at the       
Brackley &amp; District Guides' party.     
Brackley Football Club has started     
training for the F.A.Vase. They have   
never entered the competition before.  </content>
