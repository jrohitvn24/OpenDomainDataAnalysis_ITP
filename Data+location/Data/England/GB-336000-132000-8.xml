		<title>08Methodist Chapel, Middlezoy</title>
		<content> In Middlezoy we have two Chapels.The  
 newer one was built in 1898 and was   
 not called a chapel but it was called 
 the Methodist Church and some people  
 still call it that.Every Sunday Mrs   
 Carpenter runs a small school for     
 children to go and learn about God.The
 old chapel has now been converted into
 a house for people to live in.The     
 Sunday School runs from 10.00am to    
 11.00am.We have two groups of children
 the smaller ones go together and the  
 older ones go together.Mrs Carpenter  
 takes the younger ones in the corner  
 of the room and the older ones are    
 taken by Mrs Steward or Mrs Mc Cullum.
 The old chapel was built in 1847 but  
 this one was called the Methodist     
 Chapel.The Sunday School was started  
 up in 1887 and is still going strong.
