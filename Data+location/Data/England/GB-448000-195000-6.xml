		<title>06THE GUILDHALL, ABINGDON.</title>
		<content>The Guildhall used to be the name of a 
group of buildings, that were once     
separate, but are now one building.    
They once belonged to the Abbey.  The  
Guildhall was originally a Hospital    
called St.Johns it was a hall for sick 
people.  The courtroom that joins the  
gateway is the Twelfth Century St.Johns
Hospital.  The Main Gateway was built  
in the l5th century.  The Abbey Room   
that is over the gateway was the town  
jail from 1560 till 1812.  The         
Courtroom has been used for this       
purpose since 1560.  In 1563 the Roysse
Room was used by John Roysse to refound
Abingdon School.  Until 1870 63 boys   
were educated there.  The Abbey Hall   
was opened in 1966.  The original      
Council Chamber is still used for this 
purpose.
