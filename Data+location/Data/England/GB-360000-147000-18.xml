		<content> The earliest traces of man in our area
 probably date from 250B.C.when        
 Maesbury Castle was used as a hill    
 fort to retreat into when danger      
 threatened. Another such site is at   
 Gurney Slade Bottom. This was followed
 by the Romans who crossed our area    
 with roads taking lead from           
 Charterhouse to the rest of the       
 country. Parts of the modern roads    
 still follow the path of these roads  
 and they can be traced across fields. 
 The land was open until the enclosures
 of the late 18th. century and the     
 fields today are much the same size as
 they were then. Quarrying for stone   
 and the brewery followed closely by   
 the railway were the next to change   
 the landscape. The railway line can   
 still be traced, as can the old foot  
 paths that cross the fields marked by 
 the Somerset stone stiles.            </content>
