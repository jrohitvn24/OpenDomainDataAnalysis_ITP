		<title>11Wormleighton Hound Puppies</title>
		<content> This area is good hunting country and 
 is used by the Bicester and Warden    
 Hunt. Some farmers keep special areas 
 of the farm to enable the hunt to ride
 over easily thus causing no           
 inconvenience to either hunt or       
 farmer. Puppy walking is done on one  
 of the farms. The hound puppies are   
 delivered by the Master of the Hounds 
 at eight weeks of age and are usually 
 walked around the farm for four       
 months. The puppies are not walked on 
 leads but are free and as a matter of 
 course follow the person who          
 accompanies them or runs alongside    
 horses.
