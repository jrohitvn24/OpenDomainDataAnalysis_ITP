		<title>03Cornish Language (Mousehole)</title>
		<content>    The last person to speak the       
{Cornish language}was Dolly Pentreath, 
 she died in 1777 at{Mousehole.}She was
 well known in the Penzance area and   
 especially in{Mousehole.}By 1650 only 
 the people west of Truro spoke        
 Cornish; the last sermon in the       
{language}was preached at Landewednack 
 which is in the Lizard in the year    
 1678.                                 
    Since about 1860 people have been  
 trying to revive the{Cornish}language.
 How ever much literature was written  
 to try and revive the{language}no one 
 has succeeded yet in doing so.        
    Here are some{Cornish}words and    
 their meanings:-                      
        Ragenys-near an island         
        kynyaf-autumn                  
        marow-dead                     
    Raginnis hill at{Mousehole}is near 
 St.Clements isle.                     </content>
