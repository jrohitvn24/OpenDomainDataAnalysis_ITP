		<content> This Manor House faces westwards over 
 an expanse of fields and              
 coppices.There is a long drive up to  
 the classical eighteenth century      
 mansion,situated half a mile from the 
 village.The house itself was altered  
 in the nineteenth century and now     
 presents a dual appearance of         
 classical front and cotswold-stone    
 cottages at right angles to the rear  
 ,dating from the sixteenth century.   
  It has not always been a private     
 residence but has served as a hotel,a 
 social club and also as flats.At      
 present the house is undergoing       
 extensive renovation for the new      
 owner.Any appreciation of the building
 is lost in scaffolding and building   
 materials.
