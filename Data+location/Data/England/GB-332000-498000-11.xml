		<content> Farming, which often has to be        
 combined with paying guests for a     
 living, is the main occupation. The   
 land is poor and usually run as family
 farms today, combining the land from  
 two holdings and selling the spare    
 house. There is mostly mixed farming  
 and a milk lorry collects daily. The  
 main cattle breed is the black and    
 white Fresian, and a few extra heifer 
 calves may be reared as herd          
 replacements. There is a growing      
 number of suckling calves for beef due
 to aid from government grants. Fell   
 sheep crossed with a ram from a softer
 breed are kept on high ground but     
 no-one farms exclusively sheep. Many  
 farmers substitute silage for         
 haymaking. No crops other than grass  
 are grown, and the fields are         
 surrounded by stone or upright slab   
 walls sometimes combined with hedges. </content>
