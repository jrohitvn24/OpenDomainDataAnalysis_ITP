		<content> Agriculture of area is intensive      
 cereal production with only small     
 acreage of grassland and woodland. The
 land is subject to chemical spraying  
 and fertilising each year which is    
 probably main form of pollution.      
 Small area of natural meadowland left 
 with a variety of wild flowers and    
 grasses. Elm was dominant tree with   
 Ash and Oak. Most elms killed by      
 disease leaving few trees in          
 hedgerows. 4 small woodlands, haven   
 for many wild mammals from voles to   
 muntjac deer. Large and varied        
 population of birds.                  
 Footpaths radiate to all nearby       
 villages. There are 24 rights of way  
 of which 2 are bridleways, these vary 
 from local shortcuts to part of the   
 North Bucks Way.
