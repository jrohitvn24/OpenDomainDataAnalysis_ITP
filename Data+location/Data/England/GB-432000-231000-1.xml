		<title>01HOOK NORTON/INTRODUCTION</title>
		<content>This block contains two villages, the  
larger Hook Norton(pop.1700) in the NE 
corner and Great Rollright (pop. 520)in
the SW corner. In between is prime     
agricultural land, intersected with B  
class roads. Hook Norton has a whole   
range of services available, echoing   
the self-sufficiency of l00 years ago. 
Small businesses provide some work but 
many commute to Oxford/Stratford/London
It is a lively community with clubs/   
societies/evening classes etc.         
Aesthetically the village is striking, 
with a wealth of old houses(many still 
thatched) built of local earthy-colour 
ironstone arranged chaotically with new
houses in-filling and estates on the   
village edges. The local history is    
imprinted on the landscape in names of 
houses(Bedlam),streets(Netting Street, 
Tyte Lane). The SE edge is dominated by
the empty pillars of the old viaducts. </content>
