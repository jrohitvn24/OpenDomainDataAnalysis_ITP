		<content> The only primary school in the area is
 the Church of England one at Saighton.
 Built by the Grosvenor family in 1862 
 &amp; still rented from them this school  
 is for children of 5 to 11 years.There
 are 102 pupils &amp; 4 teachers but each  
 day parents help with reading,sewing  
 etc. &amp; there are part-time games &amp;    
 music staff.Very few pupils live in   
 Saighton coming from places such as   
 such as Hatton Heath,but mainly they  
 live outside the area often coming    
 by car,although some use the school   
 bus.Children may also go to schools in
 Waverton &amp; Chester or to Tattenhall as
 some in Gatesheath do.Secondary school
 pupils may go to Abbeygate College at 
 Saighton Grange or they too may go to 
 Chester.                              
 Apart from the concentration of old   
 people in Saighton the population is  
 of all ages,dispersed &amp; low in total. </content>
