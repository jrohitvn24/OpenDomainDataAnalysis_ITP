		<content> There are living in Constable Burton  
 two ladies who are as old as the      
 century.They have lived through       
 many reigns and seen many changes.Both
 can remember the time when almost     
 everyone who lived in the village     
 worked for the estate,carpenters,     
 woodmen,lime-makers and blacksmiths.  
   One of the ladies, Miss Lambert,used
 to teach at the school.She remembers  
 the children of earlier times who     
 walked long distances to school,or who
 came by train.Now when she comes to   
 school,she recognises present-day     
 children by their likeness to their   
 parents.Her work for the church,where 
 she plays the organ,and for the       
 village was rewarded recently when she
 was presented with the Maundy Money at
 Ripon by the Queen.                   
   The other lady,Mrs Middleton,still  
 runs the village shop.                </content>
