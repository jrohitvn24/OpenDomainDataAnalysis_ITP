Although there are some families who   
'belong' to the villages, the great    
majority of families have moved to the 
area. People travel to work in         
Stafford, Rugeley, Stoke, Uttoxeter,   
Wolverhampton or even further to       
Birmingham, travelling largely by car  
or using the bus services to Stafford  
and Rugeley. Bikes are also a popular  
means of transport to work.            
Increasingly retired couples are buying
property in Great Haywood, while just a
few years ago many young couples were  
moving in and starting families before 
moving on.                             
Few families have no car and many have 
more than one.
