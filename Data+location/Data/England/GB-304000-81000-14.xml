		<title>14Salterton High Street Trade</title>
		<content> All the shops in the High Street have 
 a character of their own.Some were    
 originally houses and have been       
 converted and a few have been passed  
 down in the family.As Salterton is a  
 quiet sea-side town there are only a  
 few souvenir shops.                   
 There are five banks,four sweet shops 
 and seven antique shops.One or two of 
 these could more usefully be used for 
 selling toys as there are none at the 
 moment.Also there are far too many    
 building societies and estate         
 agents.These could be made into       
 something more appealing to young     
 people such as an arcade or trendy    
 clothes shop.                         
 The High Street is quite narrow so    
 that there are sometimes traffic      
 jams.Some people think there are not  
 enough pubs but if there were more    
 there would be more noise at night.   </content>
