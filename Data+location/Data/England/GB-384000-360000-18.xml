		<title>18DERILICT LAND IN CONGLETON</title>
		<content> At West Heath is a disused sand quarry
 which awaits development.At a meeting 
 of the borough council in June 1983   
 the members took a wait and see       
 attitude.They did not give a firm lead
 although planning permission was      
 granted for light industry,recreation 
 facilities and a hotel complex.       
  Further development in 1984saw ideas 
 for a housing estate put forward      
 however the people of Congleton who   
 live nearby wish to open the quarry as
 a leisure ground for the use of       
 bathers,horse,riders and those wishing
 to picnic.This latter proposal has    
 gained popular support in the shape of
 petitions and puplic meetings.The     
 future of the quarry remains uncertain
 but clearlythe fate of the quarry has 
 now become a matter of public cocern.
