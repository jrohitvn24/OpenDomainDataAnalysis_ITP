		<content>In this area farmers own animals and   
crops. In the fields they grow barley, 
wheat and rape. They have pasture land 
too,to keep the animals in the field   
boundaries of beech and hawthorn.      
Animals that we saw on the walk were   
chickens,horses and cows. At Beechwood 
Farm they had chickens,rabbits and     
horses,one of the horses was blind in  
one eye. Not very many farms have      
sheep,pigs,cows and goats,because the  
land is good for crops.                
Another farm we saw was Rummerhedge    
Farm,which is owned by some people in  
their mid 80's. The farm has only about
six sheep,and two dogs. The farm is    
falling to ruin,with weeds and nettles 
all over the place.                    
Another farm we saw was Wards          
Farm,which had forty cattle grazing in 
a field,and is near the back of the    
Oratory.                               </content>
