		<content> At Pyecombe they have 2 services a    
 month, Evensong on the second Sunday  
 of the month and Holy Communion on the
 fourth Sunday of each month. The      
 attendance usually averages 2O-25     
 people which has grown from about 6 or
 7 over the last 6 years. Mostly older 
 people come to the services as only   
 half a dozen school children come. The
 attendance is about 1O% of the        
 population of Pyecombe. The music at  
 the Church is provided by an organ at 
 the back end of the church; the       
 organist has just completed 25 years  
 of playing. The books used in the     
 service are the English Hymnal and the
 Prayer Book for Evensong, and for     
 Communion the Alternative Services    
 Book. The main types of people that go
 to the Church tend to be farmers,     
 school teachers and business          
 commuters.                            </content>
