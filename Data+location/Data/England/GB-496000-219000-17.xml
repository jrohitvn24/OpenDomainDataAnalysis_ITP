		<content> The Brownie Pack meets every Tuesday  
 at 6pm until 7.30pm.  They meet at the
 Scout hut.  The uniform is a brown    
 dress which has two pockets.  There is
 a yellow tie with a silver badge on   
 it to show which pack she belongs to. 
 The uniform also includes a brown belt
 with a purse on it.  In this they keep
 their inspection material, such as a  
 10p coin, a plaster, some string and  
 a safety pin.  Brown Owl, the leader, 
 inspects the girls' uniforms and      
 equipment regularly to see that it is 
 clean and complete.  On their heads   
 they wear a brown bobble hat.  Brown  
 Owl is called Mrs.Curtis and Kiwi is  
 Mrs. Clements.  There are twenty-two  
 Brownies in the village pack.  There  
 are some Guides as well.  The brownies
 are divided up into groups led by a   
 sixer and a seconder.  Each group has 
 its own name such as Gnomes.          </content>
