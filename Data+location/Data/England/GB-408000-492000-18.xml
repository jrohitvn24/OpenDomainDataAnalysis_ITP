		<title>18BELLERBY SCHOOL EXHIBITION 2</title>
		<content>  Over 150 people visited the          
 exhibition, among them the two oldest 
 surviving former pupils, both now     
 living in Leyburn, and a retired      
 teacher who taught at Bellerby for 44 
 years.                                
  The older children at present        
 attending the school were responsible 
 for writing down the recollections of 
 school life in the past by former     
 pupils and the younger children gave a
 display of how clothes were washed in 
 great grandma's time.                 
  As well as marking the closure of the
 school, the purpose of the exhibition 
 was to jog memories and provide an    
 opportunity for people to meet and    
 talk over times past. This was so     
 successful that the village plans to  
 repeat the exhibition in the Memorial 
 Hall in the autumn.
