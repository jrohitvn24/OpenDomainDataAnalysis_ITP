 Our local railway-line is             
 known as{the "North-Warwickshire-     
 Line".It runs from Birmingham(Moor St)
 to Stratford upon Avon.It is mainly   
 used for passenger traffic,but new    
 cars are also carried in special      
 transporters.The trains are           
 Diesel-Multiple-Units.The two British 
 Rail Stations in our area are         
 "Shirley"&amp;"Whitlock's End Halt".      
  There are 31 weekday trains from     
 Shirley to Birmingham &amp; 33 weekday    
 trains from Birmingham to Shirley,14  
 of which go on to Stratford.          
  The line was originally owned by     
 G.W.R.(Great Western Railway).During  
 1985 several Steam-Weekends took      
 place.It was the first time in 10     
 years passengers had been pulled by   
 steam on the route.At present the line
 is under threat of closure by B.R.    </content>
