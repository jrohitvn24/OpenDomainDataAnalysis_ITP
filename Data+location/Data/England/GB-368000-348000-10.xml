		<title>10Wybunbury Delves School</title>
		<content>  The present day school is built      
 around what was originally the Delves 
 Charity School.This was built in 1822 
 for local boys, the girls attending   
 school in what is now the village     
 hall.                                 
                                       
  The school became mixed in 1958 and  
 since then has had to be extended,    
 first in 1964, when the school opened 
 under its present name: Wybunbury     
 Delves Church of England (Aided)      
 Primary School. A second extension had
 to be added to the school in 1978, due
 to over-crowding.                     
                                       
  The Delves Trust, who had the school 
 built, today issues an annual grant to
 the school for pupils' prizes.        
 Wybunbury School is the only one of   
 the three schools built by the Trust  
 which is still in the Foundation.     </content>
