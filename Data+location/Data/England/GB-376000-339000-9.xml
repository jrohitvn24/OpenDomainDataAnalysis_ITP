The School is situated in close        
proximity to a railway line and a      
reservoir.This reservoir can't be seen 
from ground level, apart from its'top  
rim, which is a pity since it is said  
to attract many interesting forms of   
wildlife. The reservoir's primary      
function was to refill the tanks of the
steam trains as they passed through,   
but it has since fallen into disuse.   
On the other side of the road is the   
station which is also  disused.        
 A fairly recent housing estate        
surrounds the school on two sides and  
the rest of the houses in the village  
line the main road.
