		<title>13Children in Wooler</title>
		<content> There are many activities in Wooler   
 for the youngsters.There is both a    
 junior and senior Youth Club held at  
 Glendale School and there are youth   
 evening classes held during the winter
 months.In the town there are Cub Packs
 Scouts,Brownies and Guides.There are  
 also groups connected to the churches.
   For many of the children there is   
 little time during the week for       
 leisure activities,particularly during
 the winter months, as it is dark by   
 the time they get home from school.   
 The children of High School age must  
 travel to either Alnwick or Berwick   
 leaving early in the morning and ret- 
 urning late in the evening.
