		<title>05The Games We Play.</title>
		<content>This is how we play British Bulldog.   
First we all put our left or right foot
into a circle. Then somebody dips and  
goes round the circle until they come  
to 'out'. The persons foot is a marker,
if they land on your foot and the word 
is out you are on. The rest of the     
children go and stand in the           
semicircle. Then the two people who are
on call a name and that person has to  
run to the other semicircle without    
being caught. If you are being chased  
by one of the people who are on, you   
can run until they catch you. They have
to say "Akie one, two, three British   
Bulldog." If they just want to say     
"Akie Bulldog." that's OK. If you think
somebody is caught but they say "No",  
they have to do a rerun. On the rerun  
we give the person ten seconds to get  
out of the semicircle.                 
                                       </content>
