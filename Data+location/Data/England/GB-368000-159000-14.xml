		<title>14TUNLEY VILLAGE</title>
		<content> Tunley consists mainly of established 
 people and few young families actually
 move into Tunley. Most young adults   
 move from Tunley as soon as they are  
 able. 90% of the working population   
 are employed in Bath or at Purnells   
 printing in the neighbouring village  
 of Paulton. Most of the houses are    
 privately owned semi-detatched built  
 after 1945. There is one terrace of   
 council owned houses and a few old    
 mining cottages including one named   
 "Colliery Cottage". One bus service   
 passes through Tunley once every two  
 hours on route between Paulton and    
 Bath . The last bus returns to Tunley 
 at 1900 hours. Tunley village has its 
 own amateur football club but most of 
 the team live in the surrounding      
 villages.
