		<content> My pet is a hamster,his name is Jim.  
 Jim is white with red eyes and a pink 
 nose,feet and tail.Jim lives in a cage
 with metal bars and a wheel to        
 exercise in.Jim has special hamster   
 bedding similar to polyester.We       
 put sawdust on the floor of Jim's     
 cage,we do this so when we clean out  
 his cage we just empty the sawdust out
 of the cage,instead of washing the    
 cage floor.When we change the bedding 
 in the cage,we only change half of the
 bedding so there is still some of     
 Jim's scent in his bedding.We feed Jim
 nuts,fruit,vegetables and cake. At    
 about 16.00 we put Jim in a hollow,   
 clear,plastic ball for exercise. When 
 Jim is in his ball we can see where he
 is and what he is doing.Jim sharpens  
 his teeth by nibbling on the bars of  
 his cage.In the daytime Jim is usually
 in bed but at night he is awake.      </content>
