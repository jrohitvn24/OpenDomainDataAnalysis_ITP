   1. Group members discussed what sort
 of things they wanted to find out.    
   2. Questionaires were written so    
 that people who worked or lived in the
 area could be asked questions, and    
 their answers were written down.      
   3. We went on a visit to the area of
 our study.                            
   4. We took photographs of any       
 interesting or unusual places,        
 people and things.                    
   5. We collected our results and     
 wrote an account of our study.        
   The next pages contain some of our  
 investigations.
