		<content> Swimming club is run every            
 Thursday, at Stokesley Baths. There is
 a little pool for non-swimmers and a  
 big pool for the others. Children     
 learn the skills of life saving and   
 work for different badges.            
 Recorders out of school is run by     
 Mrs.Watts. She mostly teaches the     
 descant recorder and uses school      
 recorder books one and two.           
 Football club is held on Wednesday    
 nights with Mr.Huddleston and on      
 Saturday mornings with the            
 parents, again like swimming they work
 for badges.                           
 Young Ornithology Club is part of the 
 R.S.P.B. It is run by Mrs.Bainbridge  
 one night a week. Sometimes we record 
 data from the wild garden, but mostly 
 we learn more about birds from slides,
 tapes and books.
