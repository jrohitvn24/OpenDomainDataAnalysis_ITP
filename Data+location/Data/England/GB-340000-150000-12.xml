		<title>12Inside Weare Church</title>
		<content> Inside Weare church there are a lot of
 things to see with a wide range of    
 ages. The floor is made of stone and  
 there is a long line of pews on either
 side of the carpeted passage. On the  
 left of the door is a very old stone  
 font where babies are christened. At  
 the back of the church is a pipe organ
 with golden pipes. At the other end is
 the altar. The floor here is made of  
 black and white marble. There are some
 beautiful golden vases on the altar   
 table. On the choir stalls is a carved
 picture of St Gregory and another of  
 Jesus. Inside the tower narrow spiral 
 stairs lead to the roof. On the way   
 you pass the ringing chamber and the  
 belfry which has six large bells.     
 After 88 steps you come out of a small
 door on to the top of the tower. You  
 can see for many miles. Weare church  
 is well worth a visit.                </content>
