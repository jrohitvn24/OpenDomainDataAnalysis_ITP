		<title>14Nuclear Waste A Pupils View</title>
		<content> Proposals have been made to dump      
 nuclear waste at South Killingholme.  
 This isnt very fair as there are      
 industries near by and the surrounding
 area is fairly well populated.        
 Killingholme already stores a lot of  
 chemical waste. The matter should not 
 be rested because if to many people   
 ignore it then it could be dumped     
 without our knowing. Also the secrecy 
 with which this issue is being carried
 out scares a lot of people and is not 
 fair. It is obvious that the people   
 who propose to dump the waste are not 
 thinking of future generations whose  
 lifes will be in danger because of    
 their stupidity. In June 1985 we wrote
 to the local paper expressing this    
 view we hope that it will influence   
 the right people.
