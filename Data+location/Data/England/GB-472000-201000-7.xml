		<content>   There is little left of the thriving
 chair industry that once existed in   
 Chinnor because of the proximity of   
 the Chiltern beech woods, although    
 there is one small factory which      
 still sends chairs to High Wycombe.   
 Both this and the Cement Works lie    
 just outside our block and provide    
 comparatively few jobs for the people 
 in the area with which we are         
 concerned. A straw-poll conducted by  
 us in Sydenham (Pop.300 approx.)      
 resulted as follows: Pilot-3;         
 Aeronautical Engineer-2; Computer     
 Trade-2; Antique Dealing-1; Furniture 
 Restoring-1; Historian-2; School      
 teacher-2; Car Auctioneer-1; Car      
 Mechanic-1; Accountant-1; Farmer-8;   
 Farmworker-8; Publican-2;             
 Needlewoman-1; Silk Blouse Maker-1.   
   In Chinnor's new estates            
 white-collar occupations predominate. </content>
