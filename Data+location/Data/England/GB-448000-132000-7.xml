		<content>  The first record of{St.Swithun's     
{Church,Martyr Worthy}is in 1251 and in
 the churchyard there is a tomb of a   
 Crusader which dates from that time.  
 There used to be  a gallery into which
 two dogs were smuggled to attend      
 services with their masters but it was
 removed in 1911.The church shares a   
 vicar with St.Mary's at Easton and is 
 very active with as many as  60 people
 attending morning service.            
   {St.Mary's Easton}is mentioned in   
 the Domesday Book and dates from      
 1120-1170.Set in beautiful            
 surroudings, it is obviously much     
 loved and an important part of the    
 community.
