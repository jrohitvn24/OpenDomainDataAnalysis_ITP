		<title>11MAYPOLE DANCING IN STOCKPORT</title>
		<content>{  Maypole dancing}at S.Paul's School. 
  Maypole dancing used to be a popular 
 dance to celebrate the return of      
 Spring. It is rarely seen now and we  
 are lucky to have Mrs Taylor to teach 
 us. We start practicing after Easter  
 and on{Mayday}we put on a display for 
 visitors. Our Maypole is a strong     
 wooden pole just over 4m high with a  
 metal base to weight it down.The top  
 spins round and has 16 long coloured  
 ribbons attached to it which are held 
 by the dancers. The easiest dance is  
 the Barber's Pole.First the boys stand
 still and the girls go round one way. 
 Then the girls stand still and the    
 boys go round the other way. You do   
 this five times and then change       
 direction. Tricky dances are Spider's 
 Web and Gypsy's Tent. Hardest of all  
 is Weaving where lovely patterns are  
 made down the pole.                   </content>
