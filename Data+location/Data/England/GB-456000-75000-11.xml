 The name of Ventnor's local newspaper 
 is the Mercury, called after the      
 messenger of the gods. It is the      
 oldest newspaper on the Island and was
 first printed in 1853 at 33 Pier      
 Street on the site of the Old Mill.   
 Recently it has changed hands and     
 moved to the High Street. It          
 originally cost one penny but it now  
 costs 10p. It is a tabloid paper and  
 has 8 pages. The Mercury is published 
 once a week on a Thursday. Two people 
 produce the paper and it has a        
 circulation of 3,000 copies. It is    
 distributed by car to local           
 newsagents. It takes about 8 hours to 
 print but much longer to set up. The  
 paper consists of reports of local    
 events, letters, announcements and    
 advertisements.                       </content>
