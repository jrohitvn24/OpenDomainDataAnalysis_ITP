 Our area could be improved            
 by having more open spaces and more   
 activity centres. There should also   
 be a nursery and another park. The    
 main shops should all be built into   
 a big shopping centre. Why not have   
 a place where old people can meet and 
 have a drink as well. We could also   
 have an activity centre for the people
 who like sports. There are a lot of   
 busy roads. It would be a lot safer   
 if there were more police patrolling  
 around because of the fear of         
 violence. They should especially      
 patrol at night when hooligans are    
 around. We have a small police station
 on our estate and this has helped to  
 deter some hooligans.
