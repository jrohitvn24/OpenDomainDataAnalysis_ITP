		<title>06THE LOCAL HUNT GILLING WEST</title>
		<content>    The {ZETLAND HUNT }goes through    
 Gilling. The people who wear the red  
 coats are the {Masters of the Hunt.   
 One Master has a hunting horn which he
 blows  when he loses  sight of the    
 hounds.Before the Hunt begins, the    
 riders gather together. This is called
 the {Meet.}The {Master of the Hounds} 
 brings the fox_hounds to the Meet in a
 horse_box.                            
    After the Meet everybody goes to a 
 wood in the area and the hounds sniff 
 for foxes. If they find a fox they    
 chase it until either they lose it or 
 catch it and kill it. If it goes down 
 a hole the masters will send a terrier
 down after it.While the hounds are in 
 the wood all the riders spread them-  
 selves out so that if a fox comes out 
 they can shake their hats in the air  
 and give a{"Holloa"}so the hounds     
 can get on to the track of the fox.   </content>
