		<content>   This is a{green belt}area and no new
 housing is allowed.Properties are well
 maintained,many being modernised and  
 some extended.A few existing buildings
 like oast houses and barns have been  
 converted to housing.A number of farm 
 houses have been sold off separately  
 e.g.Sandhurst.At Tong Farm (mentioned 
 in the Domesday Book)the house now has
 5 acres of garden and the surrounding 
 orchard land belongs to a farmer from 
 Sittingbourne.                        
  {Unemployment is exceptionally low}as
 the highly priced private housing is  
 owned by the self employed or those in
 relatively secure executive jobs.Other
 properties are occupied by land owners
 or farm workers in tied houses.Only 20
 council houses are available in the   
 area.                                 
  This survey was compiled by members  
 of Matfield Women's Institute.        </content>
