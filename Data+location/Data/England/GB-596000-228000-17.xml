 FIVE TO THIRTY SHOTS AND ABOUT TWENTY 
 DUCKS FLEW OVER THE TOP OF US.MY DAD  
 SAYS THAT SOMETIMES NEARLY A HUNDRED  
 OR SO DUCKS CAN FLY OVERHEAD.OUR FIRST
 DRIVE WAS UP BY THE FARM,WHERE A LOT  
 OF PARTRIDGES WERE UP IN THE FAR      
 CORNER.WE GOT OUT A WHITE PIECE OF    
 CLOTH,SO THEY DID'NT FLY OVER US-THIS 
 WORKED SINCE THEY FLEW OVER THE GUNS. 
 SIX PARTRIDGE WERE SHOT,AND THEY WERE 
 RETRIEVED BY THE DOGS.                
  SOME OF MY FRIENDS AND TEACHERS ASK  
 ME HOW I CAN ACTUALLY HELP TO KILL    
 ANIMALS FOR SPORT.I ALWAYS TELL THEM  
 THAT MOST PEOPLE LIKE TO EAT MEAT,AND 
 THAT WE NEVER HAVE ANY DIFFICULTY IN  
 FINDING BUYERS FOR THE BIRDS WE WISH  
 TO SELL.                              
  I EARN A GOOD BIT OF MONEY BY BEATING
 FOR MY DAD AND HIS FRIENDS-SIX POUNDS.</content>
