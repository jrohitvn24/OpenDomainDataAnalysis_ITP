 The main structural elements of all   
 the most historically important       
 buildings belong to the pre-1700      
 period and include the Castle and     
 Stables, St. George's Church and the  
 Prior's House, the Dovecote and the   
 Barn, the Nunnery in Church Street    
 which probably dates from the 15th    
 century, the Yarn Market in the High  
 Street built about 1589 and repaired  
 in 1647, the Luttrell Arms, built in  
 1500 as a home for the Cistercian     
 Abbots of nearby Cleeve but altered in
 the early 17th century to form an inn,
 the Old Manor (Lower Marsh Farm) which
 dates from the 15th century with      
 alterations in the 18th century and   
 the Gallox Bridge.
