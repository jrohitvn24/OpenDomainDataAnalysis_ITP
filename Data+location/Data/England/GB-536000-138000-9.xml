		<content> The area boasts housing dating        
 from Medieval times.No less than 19   
 buildings have survived from the 14th 
 and 15th centuries and a further 13   
 were built during the Tudor and Stuart
 periods.However the major proportion  
 of housing development has been       
 post-war and more particularly during 
 the past 20 years.Modern housing      
 estates proliferate, varying between  
 exclusive developments offering       
 individual architect designed homes   
 built to a traditional style of brick 
 under tile roofs, often in extensive  
 grounds,to small semi-detached or     
 terraced homes, factory built and     
 assembled on site, with very small    
 gardens.                              
 In 1981 the population stood at 22,395
 and it is anticipated that there will 
 be 24,090 people living in the town by
 1986.                                 </content>
