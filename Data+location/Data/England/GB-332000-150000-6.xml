      The village of Brent Knoll has   
 one primary school which was built in 
 1861. It has two classes and is for   
 children aged 4 to 11. The original   
 building is still in use and there are
 2 additional buildings for classrooms.
 There is a large playing field.       
      In East Brent there are 2        
 schools. A first school (see page 5)  
 and a private girls school known as   
 Rossholme. This is housed in the old  
 vicarage near to the church. It is a  
 boarding school which also takes day  
 pupils. There are about 80 pupils all 
 girls aged between 5 and 18. The      
 sports ground is part of the Knoll and
 once belonged to the church. It has   
 tennis courts and a swimming pool.
