		<content>The increase in winter barley and wheat
and oil seed rape favours skylarks but 
not corn bunting or lapwing.Snipe and  
curlew are seldom seen due to draining 
of damp meadows. Several species of    
water bird nest around the spring-fed  
ornamental lake in Aston Rowant such as
the tufted duck.The little owl breeds  
here as do the pheasant and red-legged 
partridge.The latter are game birds and
the "cover" provided for them benefits 
other species.Chinnor cement works     
quarry provides a further habitat.The  
Canada goose breeds there.The collared 
dove has also found its own nitch in   
the ecosystem.The nightingale no longer
breeds along the foot of the Chilterns.
The barn owl population has severly    
declined,due to the construction of    
modern barns.House martins and swallows
have adapted and will use old or new   
buildings for their nesting sites.     </content>
