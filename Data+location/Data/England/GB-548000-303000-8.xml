 The Fens are like a big washing up    
 basin in between Peterborough and     
 Downham Market. Outwell is in the     
 middle of the Fens. Over the years the
 Fens has been drained out,to leave    
 Peat at the bottom. Peat is good for  
 farming. The Fens have some of the    
 best farming land in England. Lots of 
 people helped to drain the fens. One  
 man called Vermuyden built cuts. He   
 built a cut called the Old Bedford    
 that ran off the Ouse. When they      
 opened it, it flooded so he built     
 another cut nearby called the New     
 Bedford river. The flooded area       
 inbetween the two cuts are called the 
 Washes. In 1830 some people knocked   
 some iron poles into the ground at    
 Holme Fen so you could only see the   
 top of the poles. In 1985 you can see </content>
