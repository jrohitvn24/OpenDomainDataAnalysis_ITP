		<title>17YATTENDON SCHOOL GROUNDS</title>
		<content>  In 1984 when reviewing Environmental 
 Studies teachers at the school decided
 to develop the school grounds as an   
 outdoor resource area; to form an     
 integral part of the curriculum,to    
 provide opportunities for first hand  
 scientific investigation,and to       
 facilitate ecological studies.        
 Included in this plan was the         
 development of a range of habitats and
 conservation areas, to encourage and  
 support indigenous animal and plant   
 life.As this on-site model has become 
 more established, subsequent studies  
 carried out by pupils in the school   
 grounds have revealed a significant   
 increase in the number of species of  
 flora and fauna. A third year class   
 recorded the following numbers of     
 species {pond life }17,{wild flowers  
{32, birds}15,{mini-beasts }common     
 lizard and 10 others.                 </content>
