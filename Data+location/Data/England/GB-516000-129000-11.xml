		<title>11LOCAL MEDIA IN HORSHAM</title>
		<content> Horsham and districts local newspaper 
 is The West Sussex County Times, which
 has been going since 1869. It's own   
 printing works are in the town and it 
 is published every Friday costing 10p.
 The editor Mr. David Briffet has      
 worked for the paper since 1977. The  
 workforce consists of 170 people split
 into four departments. The paper costs
 between Â£15000-Â£20000 to produce and  
 is financed mainly through adverts.   
 Mr. Briffet believes the paper has a  
 good future because Horsham provides  
 plenty of news. The chief reporter    
 decides who should cover a story and  
 whether to use a photographer. The    
 report is typed into the computer     
 before the weekly edition is put to   
 press.
