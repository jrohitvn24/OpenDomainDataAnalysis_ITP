		<content> Employment in Feltham is quite        
 good.Feltham is situated near to one  
 of the worlds largest airports        
 -Heathrow. Many of the industries are 
 connected with the airport and they   
 provide a large number of jobs for the
 people of Feltham. There are a number 
 of Industrial estates and most of the 
 goods that are made here are called   
 light industries. This means that they
 are light in weight but that they are 
 high in cost. Examples of such firms  
 are Konica who make electrical and    
 photographic equipment,E.M.I. who make
 goods for the Ministry of Defence, and
 I.C.L. who specialise in Computers.   
 There are also a host of other small  
 electrical and engineering companies. 
 As the airport is nearby there are    
 a lot of warehouses and courier       
 companies such as D.H.L. and T.N.T.
