		<title>14NEWCOMER TO INGLEBY A.</title>
		<content> Mrs Wrigley has lived in Ingleby      
 Arncliffe for nearly 3 years. Before  
 that she lived in Solihull near       
 Birmingham. She has two sons who      
 attend the village school, and a dog  
 and two rabbits. Her husband works in 
 a bank in Middlesbrough. Mrs Wrigley  
 is a supply teacher and has taught    
 recently in a Middlesbrough school.   
 She enjoys living in the village      
 because it is quiet and she has made  
 friends quickly. The family all enjoy 
 walking in the beautiful countryside  
 nearby. She plays in the local pub's  
 darts team and is on the P.T.A.       
 Committee of the village school.      
 However she has to travel by car to do
 much of her shopping in Teesside, and 
 to take her sons to activities outside
 the village, such as swimming and     
 cubs.                                 
                                       </content>
