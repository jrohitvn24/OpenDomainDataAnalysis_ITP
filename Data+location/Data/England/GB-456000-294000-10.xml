		<title>10COUNTESTHORPE'S OLDEST HOUSE</title>
		<content> This half-timbered,cruck-built house  
 which was built between 1480 and 1520 
 is known as the oldest house in       
 Countesthorpe. It is at present owned 
 by Dr Hoffler.                        
    This house has been used for       
 several different things. It was      
 originally  a farmhouse and since     
 then has been a Post Office,          
 a Butcher's and in 1930 it became a   
 Doctor's surgery. It is now purely    
 used as a home.                       
   It has six bedrooms, although one of
 them was originally a cheese room.    
 Also there are two staircases and five
 rooms downstairs including a kitchen. 
  The house is opposite St Andrews     
 church in the centre of the village.  
 This house is very much part of       
 Countesthorpe.
