		<content> Access to Brownsea is by boat from    
 Poole or from Sandbanks in Bournemouth
 and passenger motor-boats run         
 half-hourly between 10.00 and 18.00   
 hours. The return fare is Â£1.90 for   
 adults or Â£1.20 for children, and     
 passengers must also pay a landing-fee
 to the National Trust on disembarking 
 at the Town Quay on the island.       
 Private vessels may land without      
 charge at the opposite end of the     
 island.                               
 Four children, all from families of   
 National Trust Staff travel to their  
 schools in Poole and Parkstone by boat
 as there is no school on Brownsea     
 itself. There are two girls and two   
 boys who attend school in Poole. They 
 expressed mixed views on life for     
 young people on Brownsea_ the boys    
 liked "mucking about in boats" but the
 girls felt there was "not much to do".</content>
