		<content>    Smallworth is primarily one street 
 of private {HOUSING}leading eastwards 
 from the B1111, forking right to Blo- 
 Norton and left to the A1066.         
 Initially it consisted of scattered   
 farmhouses and labourers cottages with
 a school, public house and chapel.    
 Building infill has resulted in an    
 harmonious mix of new and old but the 
 school, the pub and the chapel have   
 gone and the area has been integrated 
 into and forms part of the Parish of  
{GARBOLDISHAM.}Farmland still abuts    
 private boundaries. Near the road fork
 is{HARBOUR}lane. Some think that a    
 waterway once led from the LITTLE OUSE
 to the lane to give it its name but no
 signs remain. In Blo'Norton Rd. the   
 parish{BOUNDARY}line results in facing
 dwellings being sited in adjacent     
 parishes, Blo-Norton residents being  
 far from their village centre.        </content>
