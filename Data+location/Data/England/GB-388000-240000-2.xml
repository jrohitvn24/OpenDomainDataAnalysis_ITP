		<content> Strensham  Lock on the River Avon is  
 maintained by the Lower Avon          
 Navigational Trust{(LANT).}           
 They appoint a lock-keeper, the       
 present one is a woman.  She manages  
 alone as her husband is in hospital.  
 They have a tied house.               
 Extensive work was carried out on the 
 lock in 1975 when the gates became    
 electrically operated.                
 The lock is busy in Summer with       
 privately owned and hired holiday     
 boats.                                
 During a week in July 1985, 306 passed
 through and 94 on a Sunday.  The      
 number increases during the School    
 holidays. The lock can be manually    
 operated if necessary. The river is   
 prone to flooding when the lock-keeper
 is completely cut off and has to keep 
 good food supplies.
