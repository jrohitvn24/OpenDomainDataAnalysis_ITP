		<content> Cyril Smith MBE OStJ, Liberal MP for  
 Rochdale, is the most well-known local
 figure and has done much to voice the 
 town's needs in the arena of national 
 politics.                             
   He became Rochdale's MP in 1952 and 
 has held this position to date. His   
 physical presence is particularly     
 imposing as he weighs approximately 29
 stone!; however, he says that he      
 doesn't mind about his weight. His    
 suits are made in Rochdale but his    
 shirts are made in London, by the same
 man who makes shirts for Prince       
 Charles.                              
   When interviewed about his life as a
 public figure, he told us that he     
 enjoys helping people and loves the   
 busy - busy of political life.
