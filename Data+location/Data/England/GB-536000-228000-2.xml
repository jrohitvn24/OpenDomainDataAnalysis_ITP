		<title>02The River Rib</title>
		<content> There is different animal life in and 
 around the river.Some of the animals  
 are Water rats,Kingfishers, Frogs,Fish
 and Tadpoles.You used to be able to go
 fishing at the old watermill and catch
 fish about 7inches long.There was a   
 pike as well.Then they made the       
 mill-house bigger, with and a bridge  
 and waterfall.Now the fish are        
 starting to come back and they will   
 hopefully be the same size as before  
 so people can go fishing again.       
 Pollution kills animals as well       
 as fish, and that does not help.There 
 is also a lot of litter,such as crisp 
 packets,cans and sweet wrappers as    
 well as oil.When there is a big flow  
 some fish get washed away.            
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
