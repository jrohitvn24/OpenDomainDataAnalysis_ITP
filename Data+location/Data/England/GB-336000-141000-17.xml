		<title>17A BOARDING WEEKEND</title>
		<content>   On a Saturday morning I get up at   
 seven o'clock.At eight o'clock I go   
 down to school,I do not finish school 
 until one o'clock.When I get back to  
 the house I change into my rough      
 clothes.I then have three quarters of 
 an hour before I am allowed to go down
 to the village shop.After that there  
 are either some trips to places like  
 Cheddar Gorge,or I play cricket.      
   On Sunday I get up at eight         
 o'clock,I go down to school at nine   
 o'clock for my breakfast.As soon as I 
 have finished my breakfast I go back  
 to the house,for public works.When    
 that is over there may be church or   
 free time.Lunch is at twelve thirty   
 after lunch is letter writing.When    
 that is over we get three or four     
 hours free time.There is roll call at 
 four forty five,then tea at five      
 o'clock.                              </content>
