		<title>03Survey of Parents in Codsall</title>
		<content>Car parking is thought to be adequate  
except around Birches Bridge. Public   
Transport is adequate with regular bus 
and train services to W'ton though most
parents would use their car. When asked
what they liked most about living in   
Codsall, most parents stated that  its 
location, between town &amp; countryside   
was important. Other factors were      
proximity to shops, services and roads 
especially M6 &amp; M54,sports facilities, 
friendly people, village atmosphere and
good schools. There is scope for       
improvement, according to many parents.
Among possibilities are better         
footpaths,more facilities for children,
and the control of dogs, litter and    
traffic. Among some of Codsall's more  
established residents there was a sense
that the village had already grown too 
much and a concern about the loss of   
village atmosphere was expressed.      </content>
