		<title>05Buildings in Bradfield</title>
		<content> In our area there are about 25        
 occupied buildings.They are all over  
 150 years old,many much older.Most of 
 them have or are being carefully      
 restored.They are all  built from     
 local stone;gritstone and sandstone.  
 The roofs are stone slabs.The windows 
 are  small,often with small           
 panes.Large stone slabs often surround
 the windows and support the stone work
 over the doors.Most properties were   
 probably once farms or farmworkers    
 cottages.Many are now occupied by     
 people who work in Sheffield.One lady 
 kept a paddock for her two horses and 
 rented the rest of her land.Many of   
 them had outbuildings (stables,barns  
 etc.)attached to them.Some of them had
 lovely gardens.
