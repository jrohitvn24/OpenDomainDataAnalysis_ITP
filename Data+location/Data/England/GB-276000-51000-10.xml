		<title>10RECREATION HALWELL&amp;MORELEIGH</title>
		<content> Within the limits imposed by the      
 environment the inhabitants of Halwell
 and Moreleigh have created a close -  
 knit community.  Leisure pursuits are 
 of the do-it-yourself variety. A      
 social committee organises local      
 events-a Pancake Race,a Sports Day,a  
 Car Treasure Hunt,Bonfire Night       
 Barbecue,Harvest Suppers,a Flower     
 Festival and trips to the pantomime   
 for the children.  There is an        
 enthusiastic team of bell ringers, a  
 thriving football club.  A group of   
 women meet regularly at Halwell       
 Vicarage and enjoy visiting speakers  
 and discussions.  Children from       
 Moreleigh and Halwell are members of  
 the Key and Quest Clubs,which are     
 based on the Christian Faith and      
 incorporate games evenings,practical  
 activities and camping weekends during
 the school holidays.                  </content>
