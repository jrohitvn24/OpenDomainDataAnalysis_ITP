       Mrs Simon told us about an      
 island down a track at the bottom of  
 Pump Lane.                            
       The island is 100 years old. The
 horses used to drink out of the pond  
 in the middle. Mrs Simon dug out the  
 middle of the pond so that the ducks  
 there could swim on it. The island    
 used to belong to the house which was 
 on the back straight of the track. The
 house,known as Fenton House, has been 
 knocked down because it was old and   
 dangerous. The land where it stood has
 been made into a field. There are the 
 remains of an old air-field and it is 
 about a mile in perimeter. The track  
 has two blocks. The island is in the  
 second block. There is a butcher's    
 shop in a garage at the first bungalow
 on Pump Lane. It is the only shop in  
 the village.                          </content>
