  The Rishton-Clayton area lies between
400m and 750m above sea level and is   
part of a broad valley running NE-SW.  
The area is drained by a number of     
small streams flowing over glacial     
deposits before joining the River      
Calder. The underlying rocks are all   
carboniferous in age consisting mainly 
of course sandstones, shales and coal. 
Coal was mined at several locations in 
the area though all mines are now      
closed. The sandstones have been widely
used for building and the shales have  
been used for brickmaking. The main    
type of farming is dairying. The       
traditional cotton textile industry has
disappeared from the area. Most people 
now travel to surrounding towns to     
work, especially Blackburn and         
Accrington.
