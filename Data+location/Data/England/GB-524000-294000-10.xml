		<title>10A small fen farm 1</title>
		<content>   The size of my farm is 175 acres, it
 is all made up of fields, the smallest
 fields are about 5 acres and the      
 average size field is about 10 acres. 
 I have 20 fields the biggest is about 
 20 acres.                             
   The farm is a fairly averge one for 
 the fens. It is not very big for farms
 nowadays. It is not the biggest farm  
 in Whittlesey for there are some very 
 large ones which are 1000 acres.      
 But the farm is of a fair size and I  
 could expand it if I wanted to.       
   The type of soil is black peat it is
 about 18 inches or 2 feet deep under  
 the peat is clay.  Peat is very good  
 soil but it shrinks when it dries out.
 The fens are drained by dykes and     
 rivers all the water is pumped off the
 land by electric pump.  The Fenland   
 Drainage Board is responsible for     
 this, we pay a land drainage rate.    </content>
