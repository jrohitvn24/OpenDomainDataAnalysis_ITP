   {Radio Wyvern }is our Local Radio   
 Station. Here are some of the times of
 the programmes. On Monday Graham Hall 
 is at 1 o'clock until 6 o'clock. Mike 
 George is on the Breakfast Show, and  
 Roy Leonard is on at Lunchtime, and so
 on.                                   
    They have three studios but only   
 one is used unless some thing goes    
 wrong! They record everything.They    
 put everything that has happened that 
 day in our area on a big disc. They   
 broadcast local news every so often.  
 Local people and businesses can       
 advertise on this station. They have  
 a birthday spot, a missing pet spot   
 and quizzes. I won a Radio Wyvern     
 sweatshirt on the spin the wheel quiz.
 My family listen quite regularly. I am
