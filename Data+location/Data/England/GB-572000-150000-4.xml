		<content> East Farleigh School is a County,     
 co-educational school taking children 
 of primary age.  The present building 
 is the fourth school to serve the     
 village, having opened in 1956.  The  
 site was previously occupied by a     
 wooden building which burned down on  
 Coronation Night 1953.  Because the   
 new school was built on the same site,
 it adopted the emblem of the phoenix  
 and a concrete phoenix can be seen on 
 the outside of the building.  Because 
 of the widespread nature of the       
 village, some children have a         
 considerable distance to travel to the
 school, which also serves parts of    
 neighbouring villages.  A feature of  
 the school is the Friday afternoon    
{ceilidh} at which staff and children  
 join together to share musical and    
 dramatic performances.
