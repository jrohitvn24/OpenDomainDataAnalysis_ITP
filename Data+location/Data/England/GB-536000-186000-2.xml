		<content> There are a number of different houses
 in Walthamstow. They range from Tower 
 Blocks to Terraced Houses. The number 
 of bedrooms is mainly 3/4. If you ever
 happen to be in an Estate Agentsyou   
 will notice that the prices of some of
 the houses are ridiculously high,but  
 some are at a reasonable price.A lot  
 of the houses in Walthamstow are quite
 old but they are very well built. Some
 of the houses which are only a few    
 years old have formed cracks.That is  
 because bricks nowadays are hollow and
 weak.The houses in some parts of      
 Walthamstow could be improved. Another
 problem is litter. Litter is          
 absolutely everywhere;people throw it 
 where they please,just when they are  
 approaching a litter bin. People just 
 don't care.
