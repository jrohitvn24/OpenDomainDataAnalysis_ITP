		<title>01SOUTH CERNEY AREA</title>
		<content> The South Cerney area lies to the west
 of the A419 Cirencester-Swindon road, 
 3 miles south west of Cirencester. The
 area is dominated by the extraction of
 gravel which has left many large      
 water-filled gravel pits some of which
 are now used for water sports and     
 fishing. Gravel is still extracted    
 from several pits which generates     
 heavy traffic since all the gravel is 
 moved by road. The farmland in the    
 area is mostly used for grazing       
 cattle but there is some arable land  
 to the north east.                    
  The large village of South Cerney has
 a population of about 2000. It has    
 grown considerably in recent years and
 is a popular place to live for people 
 who work in Cirencester or commute to 
 Swindon 10 miles away. There is a     
 small village at Cerney Wick.
