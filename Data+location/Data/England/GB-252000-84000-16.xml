		<title>16Downstream on the Lydd</title>
		<content>    From the stepping stones on the    
 Lydd it is a pleasant walk down the   
 banks of the river. Many tourists and 
 native Devonians come here to soak in 
 the sun and splash in the water. They 
 do not go far from their car though.  
   There is memorial here. In a cliff  
 above the river, commanding a         
 magnificent view of Brat Tor is the   
 memorial to Captain Nigel Hunter.     
   He was in the Royal Engineers, and  
 was awarded the Military Cross and    
 bar. He was killed in action on March 
 25th 1918 aged 23 years.              
   The memorial is a plaque attached to
 the rock. Under the plaque is a seat, 
 now much in needs of repair. What     
 Captain Hunter did to win his medals, 
 and why the plaque is there I do not  
 know. It is an idictment of the       
 madness of war, that a young man      
 should be cut down in his prime.      </content>
