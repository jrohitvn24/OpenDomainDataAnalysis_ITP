		<title>09Dulverton's Caravan Site</title>
		<content>  Summer time has come round again.Cars
 and caravans fill up the small        
 town.Brakes screech and cars hoot as  
 the traffic comes to a halt.Doors open
 and people scramble out of thair      
 cars.Fat and thin people,tall and     
 short people,browse around the shops  
 buying cakes and eating ice creams.   
 The caravan site is right by the river
 where you can enjoy a swim.The smell  
 of bacon and egg drifts on the        
 breeze.Right by the river the campers 
 can buy themselves a drink at The     
 Bridge and laze as the sun beats      
 down.There is a trim trail nearby     
 which is an assault course for adults 
 and children.The campers enjoy walking
 through Burridge Woods and watching   
 the wildlife.Later you can hear the   
 unzipping of sleeping bags as the     
 campers climb into bed.They talk for a
 while.Then silence.                   </content>
