		<title>19WEATHER IN SADDLEWORTH</title>
		<content> During this summer of 1985, there has 
 been little sun and much rain. This   
 has affected the ability of the group 
 to undertake a full survey of the     
 whole area. Much of our plot is       
 moorland &amp; uninhabited, thus was not  
 suitable for a school group to study. 
 Unfortunately, the weather also made  
 it unsuitable for us to study in depth
 as much of the moorland was under     
 water! Attempts to walk over the      
 higher areas were thwarted, &amp; in fact 
 there were reports in the local press 
 about a lady missing on the moors     
 during this period. Also, quite a     
 large area is privately owned, so is  
 not accessible. However, the text &amp;   
 slides describe as much of the whole  
 area as possible, but the point must  
 be made that, for instance, the       
 photographs show the western aspect   
 rather than the typical moorlands.    </content>
