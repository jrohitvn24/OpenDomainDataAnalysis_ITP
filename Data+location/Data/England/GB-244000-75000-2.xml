		<content> There is a lot to do in Lamerton.The  
 Blacksmith's Arms is a pub.The        
 Blacksmiths Arms used be known as the 
 Fortescue Arms due to the link with   
 the Fortescue family, who owned, along
 with the Duke of Bedford, much        
 of the land around it. The name       
 Fortescue Arms was changed to the     
 Blacksmiths Arms. This was because of 
 the blacksmith,s shop over the        
 road.The pub was once a resting house 
 for monks on their way to Tavistock   
 Abbey.Nowadays it sells drinks and    
 meals to all kinds of people.
