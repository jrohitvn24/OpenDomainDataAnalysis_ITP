		<title>16A DAY CARE GROUP 2</title>
		<content>  Mrs.Mitchell is paid so much per hour
 per child.It is not a great amount of 
 money but it cares for her needs,and  
 means one can buy a few extras aswell.
  Mrs.Mitchell would still be at home  
 if she didn't run the play group,as   
 she has a young son of her own,and    
 must be around the house to look after
 him.The Mitchell's have two dogs,but  
 neither goes near or seem to bother   
 the children.                         
  About five children attend the group 
 regularly and know Mrs.Mitchell,and   
 the dogs,very well.Therefore they do  
 not mind attending the play group at  
 all.                                  
  Mrs.Mitchell feels that she enables  
 some families to keep going as without
 her,young mothers,some of them single_
 parents,could not go to work.
