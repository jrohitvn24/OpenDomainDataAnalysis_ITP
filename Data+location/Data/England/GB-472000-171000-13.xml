		<content>   {BAPTISM AT BROOKSIDE FREE CHURCH}  
   At our church every so often we have
 a baptism service.  Last Sunday we had
 one and nine people got baptised.Among
 them was one of my "7UP CLUB" leaders 
 whose name is Trisha. Before they get 
 baptised they give a testimony and    
 afterwards they choose a song and the 
 congregation sing it as they come out 
 of the baptistry. Trisha chose the    
 song "As the deer pants for the water 
 so my soul longs for you". People get 
 baptised because they want to show    
 they've given their life to{JESUS.    
  {PENTECOST AT ST.PETER'S}            
  My favourite service was at Pentecost
 when we acted as if our Pathfinder    
 leader was Jesus and we were his      
 disciples. We were very sad because   
 Jesus had been killed and Jesus found 
 us, He gave us a bit of Easter Egg as 
 food.                                 </content>
