		<content>Lower Junior Class age 7-9             
In the morning I come to school by     
bus.When I get into the cloakroom I    
take my coat off and hang my bag up.   
  Then in class I put my lunch box on a
cupboard.I get my tray out then go out 
to play in the playground. Our play    
ground has a place for football and    
net-ball.I play with  my friends.Before
assembly we have the register.Our      
teacher is Mrs.Price.But today         
Mr.Denton took the register.He is the  
head master.In assembly the whole      
school goes into a big room called the 
hall.Our class sits against the        
partition which divides our classroom  
and the hall.One of my friends got a   
ten length certificate for swimming in 
the school pool.Mr.Denton tells us a   
story then we sing a hymn.
