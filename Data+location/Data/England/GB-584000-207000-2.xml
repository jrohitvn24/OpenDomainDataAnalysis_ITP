		<title>02The Canal</title>
		<content>    The correct name for the Canal     
 which runs through Heybridge is the   
 Chelmer and Blackwater Navigation. It 
 was built between 1793 to 1797 and    
 cost Â£50,000.                         
    The principal engineer was John    
 Rennie who employed Irish navigators  
 or navvies to cut the canal using     
 picks and shovels. The canal then had 
 to be made waterproof by puddling a   
 mixture of loam and clay.             
    It is the only canal in Essex and  
 the shallowest in England, being only 
 a metre in depth in places. It runs   
 between Heybridge Basin and Chelmsford
 and is 20 kilometres long and has 11  
 locks and one sea lock at the Basin.  
 For most of its length it is not a    
 true canal but a canalised river, the 
 only real cut being between the Basin 
 and Heybridge itself.
