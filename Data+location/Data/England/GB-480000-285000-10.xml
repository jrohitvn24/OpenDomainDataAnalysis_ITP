		<title>10Stoke Albany Manor</title>
		<content>  Mr and Mrs Kelley own Stoke Manor. It
is a very big house. The new part was  
built in 1680. The old part was built  
in the 13th century. The old kitchen   
was a bakery and is now a lavatory.    
They have beams in nearly every room.  
Only some of the beams are from ship   
timbers. The ceilings are quite low in 
the new part. In the old part the      
ceilings are quite low. The staircase  
is made of oak beams. They built the   
new part of the house around the       
staircase. Once the stairs used to be  
outside. The walls are 99cm thick.     
Nicolas De Rus built the house. He     
changed his name to Nicolas De Albany. 
That is where Stoke Albany got its     
name. They have  a huge kitchen which  
used to be the dairy. The oldest       
beams are the ones in the loft. In one 
of the rooms there is an old fireplace.
The spiral staircase is very steep.    </content>
