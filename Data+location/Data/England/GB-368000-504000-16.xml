		<title>16KEITHS ACCIDENT    FARMING</title>
		<content> I WAS NEAR THE SLURRY PIT. I WAS JUST 
 PLAYING BY MYSELF. THE SLURRY PIT     
 WASN'T VERY DEEP. SUDDENLY I TRIPPED  
 AND WENT RIGHT INTO THE PIT. IT WAS   
 AWFUL. THE MUCK CAME RIGHT UP TO MY   
 CHEST AND THE SMELL WAS TERRIBLE. I   
 REACHED OUT AND GOT HOLD OF THE SIDE  
 AND PULLED MYSELF OUT. I WAS COVERED  
 WITH THE SLURRY. IT WAS IN MY WELLIES,
 OVER MY TROUSERS AND UP MY JUMPER. DAD
 HAD JUST BEEN SCRAPING OUT THE MUCK   
 FROM THE COW CUBICLES. IT WAS SLOPPY. 
 I FOUND DAD. HE TOOK ME INSIDE AND    
 THEY PUT ME IN THE BATH. ALL MY       
 CLOTHES WENT INTO THE WASHING MACHINE.
 DAD SAID I MUST NOT PLAY BY THE SLURRY
 PIT BECAUSE IT WAS DANGEROUS.         
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
