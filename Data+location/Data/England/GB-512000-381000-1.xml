		<title>01LANDSCAPE, TORRINGTONS LINCS</title>
		<content>    The area lies east of Lincoln, in  
 the clay vale west of the{Lincolnshire
{Wolds.}The land rises gently towards  
 the east, but the scenery is generally
 unremarkable. Several small becks     
 drain south-westward towards the{River
{Witham,}their shallow valleys causing 
 the minor undulations in the land-    
 scape. There is little woodland. Most 
 of the countryside is devoted to      
 arable farming, though there are still
 many hedges between fields.           
    Population is sparse and scattered.
 The hamlets of{East Torrington, Collow
 and{Bleasby Moor}are included in      
 Legsby civil parish. The larger hamlet
 of{West Torrington}lies within this   
 block, and parts of the parishes of   
 Lissington, Holton Beckering and East 
 Barkwith are also included.
