		<title>15Keswick's convention</title>
		<content> The convention started in 1875 which  
 is 110 years ago.It is about God and  
 what he is saying.Two people started  
 the convention.They were the vicar of 
 St Johns Harford Battersby and Robert 
 Wilson from Cockermouth.They did this 
 because people wanted to know about   
 Jesus.At the moment Mr Hedger is the  
 record keeper.He keeps records.People 
 ask him where they can stay and he can
 tell them.                            
   Over 8-9000 people come to the      
 convention each year.These people who 
 come,come because they want to learn  
 more about Jesus Christ.The convention
 takes place once a year in each       
 country.A certain amount of ground is 
 left spare for the convention         
 tents.The books and things they sell  
 are all about Jesus Christ.
