		<content> To a lot of people, Glastonbury is the
 birth-place of Christianity in Great  
 Britain. There is a legend that Jesus 
 came to Britain as a child. But much  
 more frequently told is the story of  
 Joseph of Arimathea. According to the 
 Gospels, Joseph is the man in whose   
 garden Christ was buried. After the   
 Resurrection of Christ, Joseph set out
 to spread the Christian word. Arriving
 in Glastonbury with other followers of
 Christ, he spent the night on a hill  
 south of the town. It is now aptly    
 called Wearyall Hill.                 
 Joseph is said to have placed his     
 staff into the ground from which spot 
 grew a{hawthorn tree.}                
 Joseph is also connected with legends 
 concerning the{Chalice Well}one that  
 the Holy Grail is hidden in the depths
 of the Well,and another that the blood
 and sweat of Jesus was in the Chalice.</content>
