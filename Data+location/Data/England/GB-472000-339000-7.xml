		<content> There are no shops in Whatton or      
 Scarrington. But in Aslockton there   
 is a local shop called Spinks Bakery. 
 It sells freshly baked bread and all  
 the food we may need. Mainly Spinks   
 shop is used when people run out of   
 something so they can rush there and  
 buy it quickly. Most people shop in   
 Nottingham or Bingham. The Post Office
 sells groceries and sweets aswell as  
 pensions and stamps. We also have a   
 butchers in the village called        
 Pailings which sells all the meat you 
 can think of. Our Paper Shop just     
 sells newspapers and magazines.Just by
 the railway crossing there is a petrol
 station which sells petrol and tyres. 
 As we said that there are no shops in 
 Whatton there is however a garage     
 which sells spare parts for cars and  
 conducts some repairs.
