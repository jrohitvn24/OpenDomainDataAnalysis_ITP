		<content> Some say that St.Helens is Pilkingtons
 as they provide so much of the work,  
 both directly and indirectly,in the   
 town.Today in St.Helens they employ   
 17,000 people involved in making flat 
 glass,opthalmic glass,safety glass and
 glass fibres.                         
    St.Helens is not only Pilkingtons  
 manufacturing 'home base', but the    
 headquarters for its worldwide        
 operations--some 100 subsiduries      
 making a total workforce of 44,000    
 with sales in 1984 of Â£1.2 billion!   
    The workers and their families are 
 well provided for by 'Pilks' with     
 sports clubs and grounds,social clubs 
 and even clubs for their retired      
 workers.However in 1985 with increased
 automation and computerisation,and it 
 being cheaper to make glass elsewhere,
 the numbers employed are falling.
