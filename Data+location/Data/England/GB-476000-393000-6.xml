		<content> To live in a country area like this   
 with your own transport is very       
 pleasant but being dependant on public
 transport can make life very difficult
 especially for those searching for    
 employment and the elderly.           
 It is a myth to say that everyone has 
 a car, what is more, the cost of      
 public transport in country areas is  
 very high and the service can be      
 unreliable even if the normal timing  
 is appropriate.                       
 Many services of the local authority  
 are based at{Retford}(11 miles) and   
{Worksop}(17 miles) and it is only in  
 the last few years that there has been
 a bus service to Retford,there is none
 to Worksop.                           
 The{nearest Rail sevice}is at         
 Gainsborough, the main London         
 -Edinburgh Line is at Retford.
