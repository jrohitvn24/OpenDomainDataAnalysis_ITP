		<content>   Living in Dentdale are a number of  
 art and craft people.An artist has his
 studio just off the Main Street.John  
 Cooke who works in all media,excelling
 in watercolour.He holds regular       
 exhibitions in London,and has had some
 of his paintings bought by The Post   
 Office to advertise their services.   
    In the Main Street can be found a  
 shop selling black and white          
 photographs taken by the Forders who  
 have just published a most interesting
 book of local photographs called      
 " Open Fell, Hidden Dale."            
    Knitters of Dent knit beautiful    
 garments by hand to sell in the shop  
 called by their name.This is not      
 surprising as during both World Wars  
 Knitters of Dent became famous for    
 knitting socks,Balaclava helmets and  
 gloves to keep the soldiers warm.All  
 of the garments are different.        </content>
