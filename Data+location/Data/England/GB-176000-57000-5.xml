 There are two places of worship in    
 Cubert.  The{Parish Church}and the    
{Methodist Chapel}where services are   
 held usually twice each Sunday.       
 Attendances average between 25 and 5O 
 but increase at Church festivals and  
 Chapel anniversaries.                 
                                       
 The present Methodist Chapel was built
 in l846, but 'The Lantern', now a     
 restaurant and dated l765, was the    
 first Methodist Chapel in the village.
 In l979 the 2OOth Anniversary of John 
 Wesley's visits to Cornwall, and in   
 particular the dozen visits he made to
 Cubert between l75O-l778, were        
 celebrated in great style, with local 
 dignatories dressed in period costume 
 retracing Wesley's steps. He stayed at
 Carines which is a local farm.
