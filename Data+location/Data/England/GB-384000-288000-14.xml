		<title>14Swindon Fish and Chip Shop</title>
		<content>The fish and chip shop stands in High  
Street,Swindon and is run by Mr and Mrs
Yerolemou.It opens six days a week from
12pm to 1.30pm and from 5pm to 11.15pm.
It sells chips at 32p or 40p,fish at   
73p,chicken at 85p,pies at 60p(large)  
or 55p(small) and peas at 20p.         
The fish is delivered daily and they   
are prepared and cooked a few at a     
time.The potatoes for chips have to be 
peeled and chipped by a machine.The    
fish and chips are cooked in a large   
fryer which contains vegetable oil.This
oil is hard when new and comes in boxes
and has to be melted before it can be  
used.The fryer is heated by gas.       
Chickens are cooked for 65mins, 8 at a 
time on a spit grill.                  
Everything in the shop has to be       
cleaned regularly,usually on a Sunday. 
Hands always have to be washed and food
is never touched by hand.              </content>
