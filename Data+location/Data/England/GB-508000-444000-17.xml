		<title>17LEISURE ACTIVITIES IN LEVEN</title>
		<content> I conducted a survey,I asked eight    
 Mums what they thought about living   
 in Leven in 1985.I was interested     
 in finding out about leisure time     
 activities.What people did in their   
 spare time.The village has many       
 activities for children, adults and   
 teenagers; including Playgroup,Mother 
 &amp; Toddler group, Beavers, Cubs,       
 Venture Scouts, Scouts, Guides &amp;      
 Brownies.                             
 There are tennis courts,bowling       
 greens, snooker, darts &amp; a cricket &amp;  
 football pitch. There are many special
 activities for grownups.My survey     
 showed that the people thought that   
 there were enough activities for      
 children, adults &amp; pensioners but they
 would like more things for teenagers  
 to do.
