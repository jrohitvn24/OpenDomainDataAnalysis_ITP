		<content> The farmer at Read's Farm begins his  
 day at 6.00 with the milking and this 
 continues until 8.30 or 9.00.During   
 the morning the farmer may fertilize  
 the fields, check on the health of the
 young calves or work on maintainance  
 jobs around the farm.In the afternoon 
 he may be working on the fields,      
 manure spreading.At about 14.30 the   
 tanker will arrive to collect the     
 milk. At 16.00 milking will begin     
 again.The farm day will vary according
 to the time of year.Spring and early  
 Summer is a very busy time as silage  
 cutting takes place from 8.00 until   
 21.00. The farmer says that one of his
 biggest problems is the present E.E.C.
 quota level for milk production.      
 Another is that he receives only about
 eight pence for a pint (568 ml) of    
 milk which sells for twenty-two pence.
