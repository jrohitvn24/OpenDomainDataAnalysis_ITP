		<title>02BURGHFIELD-"NUCLEAR VALLEY"</title>
		<content> The area in which we live has been    
 nicknamed "NUCLEAR VALLEY",because of 
 the number of establishments in the   
 vicinity of Reading connected with the
 military and with arms production,both
 conventional and nuclear.Very near to 
 us are the Royal Ordnance Factory     
 (ROF) at Burghfield,the Atomic Weapons
 Research Establishment (AWRE) at Ald- 
 ermaston,which provide a major source 
 of employment in the area;and RAF     
 Greenham near Newbury,which has been a
 centre of controversy over the past   
 few years because of the U.S.A Govern-
 ment's decision to station 96 Cruise  
 missiles there.These began to arrive  
 in 1983.                              
  The teams which man these missiles   
 are to be housed in a large develop-  
 ment at RAF Clayhill (formerly HMS    
 Dauntless,a training centre for WRNS),
 just outside Burghfield Common.       </content>
