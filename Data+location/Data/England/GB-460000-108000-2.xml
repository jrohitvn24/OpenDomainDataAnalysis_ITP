		<title>02Landscape in Southwick</title>
		<content> The area is generally devoted to      
 farming and woodland. The tributaries 
 of the westerly flowing Wallington    
 river crosses the area. In the far    
 South East is situated{H.M.S.Dryad}and
{Southwick House,}both inaccessible to 
 the public.                           
 The woodland which covers about a     
 quarter of the area is scattered      
 randomly among the farmland. It is    
 situated mainly in the north and is   
 particularly dense. The areas are     
 mainly mixed with both deciduous and  
 coniferous trees,including oak, ash,  
 beech and hazel trees. Coniferous     
 woodland occurs less frequently than  
 the mixed, and covers smaller areas   
 like Friar's Coppice. Trees like      
 spruce and silver birch are frequent  
 and in Staple Cross Copse in Boarhunt 
 some of the woodland is used          
 commercially.                         </content>
