         { ------- -------             
 In Station road there is{Clacton's    
 railway station which was built in{   
{1867 }and after 62 years of it being  
 there,it was pulled down and another  
 Railway Station was built, and opened 
 on the {4th of November}1929.The      
 Trains that you find at Clacton are   
 309,s 312,s 308,s 302,s.About two     
 hundred trains come in,in two         
 days.There are 10 to 13 coaches on a  
 train and sometimes less. At Clacton  
 there is a new train called the{Essex 
{Express.}It was new livery which is   
 orange and brown,a bit like a Jaffa   
 cake.The trains at Clacton are quite  
 old,the East Essex Express is really a
 refurbished 309.There are 60          
 staff,excluding those who drive the   
 Trains and the guards.                </content>
