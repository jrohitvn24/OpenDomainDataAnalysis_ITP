		<title>14Bramhope: Housing 2</title>
		<content> Characteristics of the estate housing 
 situated to the west of Otley Road    
 include brick construction,integral   
 garages and gardens to front and rear.
 Though the majority of houses are the 
 detached variety,the area does include
 semi-detached houses and bungalows.   
 Another estate which nestles into the 
 hillside overlooking the Wharfe Valley
 consists of stone-faced properties,   
 frequently containing second bathrooms
 and 4 or more bedrooms.Semi-detached  
 houses provided by the Local          
 Authority can be found in two small   
 locations,but approximately half of   
 these are now privately owned.In      
 addition to Bramhope's few purpose    
 built flats,most apartment style      
 homes result from the conversion of   
 larger properties.The wide variety of 
 building styles in this area enhance  
 Bramhope's pleasant rural atmosphere. </content>
