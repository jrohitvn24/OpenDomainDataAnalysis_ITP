		<title>13WICKLEWOOD PRIMARY SCHOOL</title>
		<content> Wicklewood County Primary School was  
 built in 1878. It opened on Monday,   
 20th January, 1879 with 65 pupils.    
 By February there were 99.Today there 
 are 56 pupils taught by three teachers
 and a part-time teacher. We also have 
 a welfare assistant, secretary,       
 crossing patrol, and a caretaker. Our 
 lunches are cooked at the school.     
  The school originally consisted of   
 the school house and two classrooms.  
 These rooms are now the hall and      
 computer room.In 1982 the house was   
 changed into an infant classroom, with
 offices and stores upstairs. Two      
 classrooms were added to the original 
 school in 1908. They all had open     
 fires until the end of 1945. Pupils   
 stayed at the school until they were  
 14 years old, butin 1939 all the older
 pupils transferred to Wymondham       
 Secondary School, now the High School.</content>
