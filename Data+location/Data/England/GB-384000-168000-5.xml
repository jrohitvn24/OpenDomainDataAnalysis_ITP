 the outskirts of Corsham. They are for
 training T.A.recruits,and are also    
 used as a store base.The barracks were
 named after Major General Sir Basil   
 Hill KBE CB DSO Director/Controller of
 Ordinance Services July 1936. Then in 
 1972, HQ RAOC T.A.returned. The Royal 
 Army Ordinance Corps 1 consists of    
 1500 part_time volunteers they would  
 go on several training camps at       
 week_ends, but most of the training   
 takes place at Hudswell.In the event  
 of war,both regular and T.A. soldiers 
 would be called up and issued with    
 SLR's and respirators,combo pens,and  
 their protective clothing,in which    
 they could live up to five days. Then 
 they would be transported to Germany. 
 We all tried the assault course and   
 enjoyed the challenge.
