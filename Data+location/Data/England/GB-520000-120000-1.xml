		<content>{COWFOLD}is a village in The Sussex    
 Weald between Horsham and The Downs.  
 There are 1500 inhabitants.A feature  
 of the village is the large 13th.     
 century church of St Peter with its   
 row of houses enclosing the churchyard
 on two sides.Cowfold stands at the    
 junction of two main roads the A272   
 and the A281.Both of these roads are  
 very busy and heavily used by lorries.
 Cowfold is fortunate in having a range
 of shops,but shopping is difficult due
 to the traffic and parking is         
 restricted.Many villagers feel that   
 Cowfold needs a bypass.The countryside
 around is wooded.The farms are mainly 
 stock and dairy farms.There is a small
 Industrial Estate at Oakendene just   
 outside the village.Many people work  
 at Gatwick Airport and some commute   
 to London.A new estate is being built 
 at present of 150 houses.             </content>
