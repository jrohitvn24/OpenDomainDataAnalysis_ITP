		<title>17CHANGES IN BARNARD CASTLE</title>
		<content> Since the army left,several pubs have 
 closed and the rest have had to offer 
 more.The two cinemas have closed and  
 less demand have forced the standed of
 rented property to rise.The Youth     
 Custody Centre has helped replace     
 population and jobs."The Bank",once a 
 trouble area,has improved with five   
 antique shops,a designer knit wear    
 shop and three restaurants.Many girls 
 married soldiers.The social patterns  
 of the town have had to change.Many   
 young people of the town think there  
 are not enough leisure facilites and  
 not enough jobs.Some people think the 
 town needs a swimming bath and sports 
 hall.Others object to the cost of it. 
 The design and position of the new    
 supermarket is causing concern,as is  
 the large,new factory building at     
 Glaxo.Recently tree felling has also  
 upset some people.                    </content>
