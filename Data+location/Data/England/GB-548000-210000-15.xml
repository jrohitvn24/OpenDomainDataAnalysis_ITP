		<content>{Joe's}hobbies were rabbiting. They    
 used to go out to the fields and catch
 the rabbits. They enjoyed it.         
                                       
 When{Wally}was younger the rent of his
 house was half a crown which, in our  
 day is 13p. This is the cost of a     
 packet of crisps.                     
                                       
{Grace Allen}remembers her first cinema
 film.  It was Mickey Mouse and she saw
 it in Portsmouth.                     
                                       
{Wally}goes to the Darby and Joan Club.
 He has meals on wheels four days a    
 week and his daughter visits him on   
 Sundays.                              
                                       
{Percy} has seen a lot of changes in   
 Harlow from gas lamps to electricity. 
 He remembers Churchgate Street before 
 it was tarmac.                        </content>
