		<content> There remains a small core of pre-1914
 property round Newbottle Street,Edwin 
 Street,Nesham place &amp; along Burn Park 
 road.Some of them lack basic amenities
 but have been modernised. Private &amp;   
 council estates have been added to    
 this core.The inter-war years saw the 
 Newtown,Hall lane,Hetton Road, &amp; parts
 of the villa and North Rectory estates
 being developed but private           
 construction was limited.Since this   
 period the private sector has rapidly 
 expanded,the main part of this being  
 Leeholme,Mill Hill,Lawnswood &amp; Dairy  
 lane estate (500 dwellings) 36 units  
 of three schemes for sheltered housing
 are in the council's plans. Newbottle 
 is mainly private housing leading up  
 the hill to the village. Fence Houses 
 is a mixture of council property &amp;    
 private terraced houses along the main
 street.                               </content>
