		<title>16Flood Prevention in Combwich</title>
		<content>   {Combwich}was regularly cut off from
 the outside world by tides but in 1981
 and again in 1983 houses,shops and the
{Anchor Inn}were flooded.In 1981 the   
 tide reached{7.9m.}above{sea level}and
 damage was estimated to have cost{    
{Â£275000.}In 1983 the tide reached{7.6m
 above{sea level,}causing about{Â£71000}
 worth of damage.Work was started by   
 Wessex Water in the summer of 1985 to 
 reduce the risk of flood damage.The   
 proposed scheme comprised the         
 construction of a floodbank at a      
 height of 8.4m.running around the     
 village.A new sluice was to be        
 provided in the Pill next to the      
 Harbour Garage incorporating emergency
 penstocks to guard against tidal flap 
 failure.THe expected cost of the works
 was{Â£561000.}
