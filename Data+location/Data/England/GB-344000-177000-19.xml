		<title>19THE JOURNEY TO PORTISHEAD</title>
		<content> At about 9.00 we were all in the class
 room getting things ready like clip   
 boards.Then at about 9.10 we were     
 walking to the bus stop which was     
 opposite the{Clannage,}we waited for  
 about 20 mins but during that time the
 boys were being stupid and doing      
 things like putting their hands out   
 when cars drove past but Mr Lang told 
 them off.Then some of the girls were  
 waving to people who drove past but   
 quite soon they stopped before he told
 them off as well.About 9.30 the bus   
 came and we all jumped on at the same 
 time but Paul O'shea,Bryn Herbert and 
 Iain Eld got on first and sat at the  
 back of the bus.Me and Vicky sat the  
 second seat from the second door.Mr   
 Lang got on the bus last and paid Â£21 
 for tickets but it was so long that he
 had to roll it up.Some of the boys    
 were{idiots!   }TANYA STEWART         </content>
