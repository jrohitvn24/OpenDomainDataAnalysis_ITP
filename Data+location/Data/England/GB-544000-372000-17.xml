		<title>17An Old Lady's Day in Alford</title>
		<content> The lady in question is 84 years of   
 age and suffers from arthritis which  
 means she cannot walk very well. She  
 lives in Hamilton Road, Alford,       
 Lincolnshire on her own. She gets up  
 at about 9.30am, makes her breakfast, 
 washes up her dirty pots and looks at 
 the daily newspaper; the rest of the  
 morning is spent preparing for her    
 lunch. On a Friday afternoon she goes 
 to the Senior Citizens Club. This is  
 held in the Congregational Church     
 Hall, Alford and begins at 1.30 pm. At
 this club she plays card games and    
 chats to her friends. The club        
 finishes at 4.15 pm. She then has her 
 tea at 5.00 pm. She then reads and    
 watches television until about 10.00  
 pm, when she goes to bed with a cup of
 coffee and a biscuit.
