		<content>   Although the villages are only about
 25 miles from{London}the houses do not
 have all the{Main Services}that you   
 would expect in 1985.  No houses in   
 the area have{Mains Gas}and so have to
 rely on{electricity}or{calor gas}for  
 cooking and{oil, coal}or{calor gas}for
 heating.                              
                                       
   Many of the houses in the area,     
 especially in{West End}are not on{    
{Mains Drainage}and so have to rely on{
{Cess pits}or{Septic tanks}.  In order 
 to cope with this lack of drainage the
 school has its own{Sewage Treatment   
{Plant}.  Further problems are caused  
 by the very bad natural drainage which
 causes{flooding}of the fields and     
 roads throughout the area during the  
 winter.
