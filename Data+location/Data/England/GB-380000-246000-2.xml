		<title>02TEACHING AT MADRESFIELD</title>
		<content>{Mr.White}has taught at {Madresfield   
{School}for 7 years. He enjoys maths   
 and art. He would like to stay as     
 he feels there is much work that he   
 can still do for the school.          
 The school is about 115 yrs old, and  
 was built by Earl Beauchamp. 2000     
 pupils have been educated here over   
 the years.Originally children started 
 this school at the age of 5, and left 
 at 14. Now they leave at 11. Over the 
 years the school was enlarged and the 
 field was provided for recreation by  
 Lady Beauchamp. The school has grown  
 from 35 children in 1978 to 65        
 children in 1985. The Board of        
 Governors,including {Mr.White},has    
 recently increased from 6 to 14       
 people.
