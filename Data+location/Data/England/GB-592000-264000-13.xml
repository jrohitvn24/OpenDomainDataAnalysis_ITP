  REPORTS FROM THE LOCAL PRESS         
1 Thurston CEVC Primary School.        
  The East Anglian Daily Times of      
16-7-85 carried a report of the concern
of the Governors of the school over    
possible overcrowding of the school.   
  From 1985 onwards, Thurston was set  
to expand considerably,and it was felt 
that the school would need a permanent 
extension,instead of mobile classrooms,
to cope with the expected rise in      
numbers.                               
  The Governors wished to be assured   
that the Education Authority was aware 
of the impending rise in numbers and   
was planning accordingly.              
  The Headmaster was sure that the     
necessary resources would be available 
and the Area Education Officer said    
that a submission for a permanent      
extension would be made in autumn 1985.</content>
