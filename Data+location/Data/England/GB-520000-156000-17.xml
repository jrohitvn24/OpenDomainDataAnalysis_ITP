		<content>    Mr.&amp; Mrs. Dicker have lived in the 
 village for 63 years. There was{no    
{water}laid on when they first came    
 here so they had to get it from the   
{village pump.}There were{no sewers and
{the toilets were outside.}There were  
 no houses opposite the school only    
 fields. They had{no electricity only  
{oil.}They like living here because it 
 is open countryside and they like     
 village life. There are no rough      
 people or hooligans. They would like  
 to see a better bus service in the    
 village and a full time road sweeper. 
 In his spare time Mr. Dicker gardens  
 and walks the dog and helps his wife  
 to clean the school.{Mrs Dicker is the
{school caretaker. Mr. Dicker is a bus 
{driver}and works for London Country,  
 Leatherhead. He has worked for them   
 for 37 years.
