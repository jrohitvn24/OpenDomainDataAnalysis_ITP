		<title>03THE MARKET SQUARE</title>
		<content> The{Market Square}has changed very    
 little in the past two hundred years. 
 Some of the buildings are now shops.  
 There is also an {old peoples home }  
 opposite the Market Square.A{brewery} 
 once stood where Pattisons the        
 Newsagents is today.On the South side 
 of the Square there is an 18 century  
 house which is now the modern Dental  
 Practice of Mr David Watt.            
 In the Square on a Monday people come 
 with their{stalls}to sell things like 
 clothes, and shoes, others sell       
 food.The Chamber of Trade erect an    
 illuminated Christmas tree in the     
 Square.                               
 Through the{Cloisters}into the        
 Churchyard there is a large flat stone
 where tenants placed their rent money 
 instead of tithes.This was until 1836 
 when the custom died.
