		<content> Only two roads of any significance run
 through this block: the A4104 from    
 Little Malvern to Upton, and the B4211
 from Upton to join the A438 at Long   
 Green.  Other roads merely lead to and
 connect various houses and farms.     
                                       
 There are, however, many footpaths,   
 the routes of which show that they    
 were formerly used by farm workers.   
 With increasing use of bicycles and   
 motor cars, footpaths are no longer   
 used in daily life and many have      
 become impassable.                    
                                       
 Many people recognise that walking is 
 the best way to enjoy the countryside,
 so the Malvern Hills District Footpath
 Society was formed in 1973 with the   
 objects of walking footpaths and      
 repairing and replacing damaged stiles
 and footbridges.                      </content>
