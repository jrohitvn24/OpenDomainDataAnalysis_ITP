		<title>17Some thoughts from grown-ups</title>
		<content>   We talked to a lot of grown-up      
 people and most of them said the same 
 thing.                                
     UNEMPLOYMENT                      
   The people we spoke to were all     
 upset because there are so many people
 in the country who can not get any    
 work.The worst places are the big     
 cities but all over the country there 
 is unemployment.The sad thing is that 
 many of the people are those who have 
 just left school and unlike years ago 
 it does not apply to only those with  
 little or no qualification.           
   Most people thought that the        
 situation would not get any better in 
 the future and nobody we talked to    
 said that other parties would do any  
 better or worse.                      
   It was strange that in our area we  
 could only find 4 or 5 people out of  
 work or maybe 2% of the population.   </content>
