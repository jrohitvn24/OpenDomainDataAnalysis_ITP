		<content> The line from Hereford to Newport was 
 built in 1853. Originally this area   
 was served by stations at St. Devereux
 and Pontrilas, but these were closed  
 in 1959. Each weekday 13 passenger    
 trains run each way. Some are 3 coach 
{diesel}multiple units; these usually  
 terminate at Hereford, whilst trains  
 to and from Manchester and Crewe      
 usually consist of six coaches hauled 
 by a diesel locomotive. All trains run
 through to Cardiff and there is a     
 skeleton service on Sundays. This line
 is an important{freight corridor}with 
 frequent goods trains running between 
 the North of England and Wales and the
 West. Occasionally it is also used by 
{special excursion steam trains.}In    
 1985 new concrete sleepers were laid  
 and the line reballasted. The line is 
 double track.
