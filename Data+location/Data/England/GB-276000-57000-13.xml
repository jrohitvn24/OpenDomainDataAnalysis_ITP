		<title>13Energy sources (Harberton)</title>
		<content> The recent availability of a          
 plentiful wood supply has encouraged  
 the use of woodburning stoves as a    
 source of energy in the home.         
 All homes these days are supplied     
 with mains electricity, but there is  
 no mains gas in the area. Coal, oil,  
 and bottle gas are the other types of 
 energy sources used.                  
 Because of the nature of the housing -
 mostly stone, apart from loft         
 insulation, most modern methods of    
 conserving energy are not practical.  
 As yet solar panels and other         
 alternative sources of power are not  
 in evidence, traditional cosy open    
 fires with perhaps background central 
 heating being more the norm.          
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
