  This is a girls' skipping game which 
 requires two ropes. Two people, one at
 each end of the ropes, swing the ropes
 in opposite directions. A third person
 skips in the ropes. When that person  
 makes a mistake, it is somebody else's
 turn.

 MAN HUNT                              
                                       
  Man Hunt is a game for boys or girls.
 It can be played on foot or on        
 bicycles. One person is nominated as  
 the hunter and he has to catch someone
 and say "Man Hunt." When a person is  
 caught, he becomes a hunter, too, and 
 helps to catch the rest.
