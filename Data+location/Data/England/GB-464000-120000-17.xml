		<title>17MY LIFE IN EAST MEON</title>
		<content> In January I had my niece from Rome   
 come to East Meon on her way to       
 America.In March another niece came   
 from Australia to settle in East      
 Meon.In the year 1985 I have been very
 sad and concerned about the Methodist 
 Church which I understand the powers  
 that be talk of closing.But so many   
 other Churches have made it a matter  
 of Prayer.I am simply trusting it will
 remain open for many years.I attend   
 the Luncheon Club and the Over 60's   
 and find many friend and real         
 kindness.In a weeks time I am having  
 the niece from Rome come again on her 
 way to Canada.
