		<content> on the top of a small hill in the     
 middle of fields.  It goes back to the
 eleventh century but the dedication   
 suggests a church on this site        
 before the Norman Conquest. It is     
 thought that there used to be a       
 village around the church but in the  
 time of the Black Death people left   
 and never came back.   There are      
 twelve people on the electoral roll.  
 There is a private burial ground at   
 the entrance to Hornets Farm,         
 Beauchamp Roding.  The interesting    
 feature is the tomb of Mrs. Susan     
 Mead.  Her husband, Isaac Mead        
 (l859-l945) a farm labourer from the  
 age of eleven, by hard work became a  
 farmer and master miller.   He also   
 read widely and in l923 published his 
 autobiography "The Story of an Essex  
 Lad".
