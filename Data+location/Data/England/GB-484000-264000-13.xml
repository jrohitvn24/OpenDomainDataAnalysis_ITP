		<title>13 A Day in my Life</title>
		<content>By Paul,aged 11.                       
At 8 o'clock I get up &amp; get washed,then
I have my breakfast.After breakfast I  
go shopping where I usually get a World
War Two model because models are my    
hobby.I also buy a bar of chocolate    
before I go home on a bus.Then I watch 
the television or go on the computer.  
After I have had lunch I exercise my   
rabbit in the garden &amp; look at the fish
pond which has a fountin &amp; a waterfall.
It is well stocked with fish.It has two
carps,two comets &amp; fourteen gold fish, 
one of which is a fantail &amp; is  five &amp; 
a half years old.                      
It is not an ordinary pond ,it's 3 feet
deep &amp; made of stone.                  
I then construct my models.            
At about 8 o'clock I have supper &amp; I   
read in bed.                           
                                       
                                       </content>
