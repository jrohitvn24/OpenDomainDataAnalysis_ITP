		<content> After farming tourism is the only     
 "industry" in the area. Many farm     
 incomes are supplemented by letting   
 rooms for bed and breakfast, or       
 holiday cottages, or land for camping 
 or caravanning, also there are two    
 small guest houses in the village.    
 Whilst realising the importance of    
 visitors to the economy of the area   
 some resentment exists, because of the
 overcrowding of the roads, beaches and
 towns - parking in Totnes in "the     
 season" is practically impossible!    
 Also when homes are for sale in the   
 area, resentment is felt when they are
 sold for high prices as holiday homes,
 thus precluding young local couples.  
 By many the visitors or "grockles" are
 considered a necessary evil!
