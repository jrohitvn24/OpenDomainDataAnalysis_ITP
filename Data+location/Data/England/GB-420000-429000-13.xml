		<title>13TRAFFIC SURVEY ON THE A650</title>
		<content> On July 3rd we spent an hour in the   
 afternoon on a survey of the traffic  
 outside our school, Tong Upper at     
 Westgate Hill, three miles from the   
 centre of Bradford.  The road is the  
 A650 which links Bradford and         
 Wakefield and is also an approach road
 for the M62 and M1 motorways.         
   We divided the vehicles into two    
 groups, long distance traffic and     
 local traffic.  The long distance were
 mainly lorries carryiny a variety of  
 goods such as steel, cement, wool,    
 petrol, chemicals and frozen foods. We
 noticed lorries belonging to firms    
 from Manchester, London, Scotland and 
 Germany.  Some of the lorries belonged
 to local road haulage firms such as   
 Wilson and Haigh and were taking goods
 all over the E.E.C.  Short distance   
 vehicles carried bread and fresh food 
 or were service vans such as the YEB. </content>
