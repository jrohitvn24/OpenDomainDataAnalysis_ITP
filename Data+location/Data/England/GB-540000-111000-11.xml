		<title>11BOTTLE BANKS</title>
		<content> In 1982 Lewes District Council        
 installed{bottle banks}at several     
 locations throughout the district.    
 These{are metal containers}where the  
 public puts used bottles{for          
{recycling.}There are two in this      
 block at Malling, one for clear glass,
 one for coloured.                     
 The bottles are sold to manufacturers 
 in London whose lorries collect it    
 fortnightly. It is cleaned and made   
 into cullet by crushing. This is      
 either used for making roads or melted
 down to make new glass.               
{Many local people save their bottles. 
 This has three advantages: it helps   
{avoid broken glass}in dustbins, makes 
 a{small profit}which is{donated to    
{charity}and{saves energy and          
{resources.}Not all bottles are        
 recycled in this way. Some, such as   
 milk bottles, are returned for re-use.</content>
