		<content>     Our Domesday block is mainly rural
 with many scattered farms and hamlets.
     The fields are used for crops such
 as silage, barley and wheat.  Some of 
 the fields though are used for        
 pastoral activities, like dairying.   
     Most of the farm houses are       
 scattered some distance away from the 
 hamlets.  Most of the farms are modern
 although some of the farms are much   
 older.  All the houses are well kept, 
 as are the crops.                     
     There are many trees around.      
 There are a few roads, mostly they are
 narrow lanes with high hedges about   
 five feet high, which obscure the     
 view.                                 
     Near the small villlage of        
 Maesbrook flows the river Morda, which
 can be fished.                        
     Our Domesday block is a good      
 example of typical British countryside</content>
