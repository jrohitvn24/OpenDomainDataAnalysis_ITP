		<content>...old barn at Corks Farm have applied 
for planning permission to convert it  
into a single large dwelling.          
 The big timber barn is one of a group 
of buildings at the farm which are no  
longer needed for agriculture the trust
has come up with the following two     
ideas;                                 
 1) To convert it into a family home   
 2) To make it into a smaller home /   
workshop for a craftsman to live and   
work in.The Trust have said that they  
believe their design would preserve the
outstanding qualities of the barn and  
enhance the overall group of buildings.
They are also concerned about the large
number of barns in the area which have 
fallen into disuse owing to modernised 
methods of farming, as they feel that  
many of these buildings are excellent  
examples of architecture and should be 
preserved.                             </content>
