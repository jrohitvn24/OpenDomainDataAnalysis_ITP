		<content>   Chemical sprays kill some insects,  
 but many others survive. The most     
 common insect is the midge, seen in   
 vast numbers after 9p.m. Amongst the  
 rarest insects are a hoverfly         
 discovered at Wandlebury in 1982 and  
 hornet. 32 bee and wasp species have  
 been seen at Wandlebury, including the
 bumble and wall mason bees, tree and  
 ruby tail wasps and hornets. Many     
 lesser stag beetles are found.        
 Scolytus scolytus, carrier of Dutch   
 elm disease is declining in numbers   
 now that many elms have been lost.    
 Some people visit the area            
 specifically to spot insects,         
 especially when ivy flowers. Moth-trap
 studies are being carried out. Species
 have not yet been officially listed,  
 but include the fairly rare lobster   
 moth and the common holly blue        
 butterfly.                            </content>
