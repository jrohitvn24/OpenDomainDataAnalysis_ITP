		<title>01LANDSCAPE-DARENTH VALLEY</title>
		<content>Our area is rural,with farmland full of
cereals and other crops.The villages we
live in are in the Darenth Valley,close
enough to the motorway to attract com- 
muters. Many people travel by rail to  
London to work each day. Not many of   
our parents work in the villages,so we 
are glad of the motorways and railways 
to take them to work in towns. When the
War ended in 1945, more people came to 
live in our villages so modern houses  
were built for them;the older houses   
are clustered around the village       
church.                                
Although we are near a motorway,it is  
cleverly planned so the villagers do   
not notice it. Some of the older       
houses have walls built of flint,some  
have white weather boarding. We also   
have timber framed houses in our       
villages.
