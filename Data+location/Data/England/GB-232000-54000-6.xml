		<content>  Some of the old farm labourers'      
 cottages have been converted into     
 holiday accommodation,and are         
 let to families on a weekly basis in  
 the summer.                           
     There are no official caravan or  
 camping sites in this area, but many  
 of the farmers allow caravans and     
 short-stay campers,and there is some  
 catering for overnight accommodation. 
     Most tourists arrive by car, which
 leads to occasional congestion on     
 narrow roads.Access by rail is not    
 possible,as the nearest station is at 
 St. Germans,approximately four miles  
 from Downderry.Presently there is no  
 public service link from the station  
 to the villages and hamlets,but recent
 Government legislation and community  
 pressure could result in the provision
 of a minibus link service between the 
 major transport undertakings.         </content>
