		<title>03Job Survey of Clacton</title>
		<content>     We have done a survey to find out 
 how many children's parents work in   
 Clacton, in the local area and in     
 London.The local area includes        
 Colchester, Walton and Harwich.       
     We found out that about half of   
 the parents work in Clacton, about a  
 fifth work outside Clacton but still  
 locally, the rest in London and other 
 places.                               
     I think many people work in London
 and other towns outside the local area
 because Clacton is a small town and   
 because it has a main line railway    
 station.                              
     We have a lot working locally     
 bacause we have so many docks so a lot
 work at sea or at the docks.
