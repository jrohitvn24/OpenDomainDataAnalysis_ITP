		<title>17SOCIAL CONCERN IN CURDWORTH</title>
		<content> A PROPOSED PLAN FOR A MOTORWAY SERVICE
 AREA WITH HUNDRED BED ACCOMMODATION.  
 RESTAURANT, PICNIC AREA, LORRY, COACH 
 AND CAR PARKS ON GREEN BELT BETWEEN   
 THE M42 MOTORWAY AND ADJOINING        
 CURDWORTH VILLAGE WAS MADE PUBLIC AT  
 CHRISTMAS. DISBELIEF AND OUTRAGE      
 PROMPTED A PETITION AND PROTEST       
 LETTERS TO THE PLANNING OFFICE. OUR   
 LOCAL M.P. ADVISED FORMING A RESIDENT 
 ASSOCIATION AND A PUBLIC MEETING IN   
 CURDWORTH VILLAGE HALL, 250 RESIDENTS 
 ATTENDED AND VOICED FEARS OF THE      
 ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS OF ATTACHING A  
 SERVICE AREA TO A RESIDENTIAL ONE,    
 WITH FUMES, NOISE, SECURITY AND       
 DRAINAGE. LETTERS UNDERLINING THESE   
 OBJECTIONS WERE SENT TO THE           
 APPROPRIATE AUTHORITIES SIX MONTHS    
 LATER THE PLAN HAS STILL NOT COME     
 BEFORE THE PLANNING COMMITTEE AND     
 THREE ADJACENT HOUSES ARE FOR SALE.   </content>
