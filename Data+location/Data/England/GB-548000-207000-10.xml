		<title>10SEWALDS HALL FARM</title>
		<content> SEWALDS HALL FARM:{495074.}is         
 mentioned in the Domesday Book. The   
 central area of the house was         
 destroyed around 1885. Three          
 generations of the Furze family have  
 farmed here although they originated  
 in Somerset. There are two employees  
 who live in tied cottages as do three 
 other retired farm workers. Prior to  
 1977 this was a dairy farm with 100   
 head of Friesian/Canadian Holstein    
 cross-bred cows. This is one of the   
 few local farms to retain livestock   
 with arable farming. At present, 30   
 young bullocks are bought in for      
 fattening, and sold after 18 months.  
 The dominant crops are oilseed rape;  
 feed-wheat; and barley. Much of the   
 wheat &amp; barley is used for local      
 livestock feed and the balance is sold
 to animal food processing concerns.
