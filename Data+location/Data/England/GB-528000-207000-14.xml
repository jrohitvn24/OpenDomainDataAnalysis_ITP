		<title>14Bayford Station</title>
		<content>   The station is in need of decoration
 and some modernisation. The waiting   
 rooms have been taken down and new    
 ones are going up at present.         
   At{Bayford station}there are two    
 large mirrors, they are used to enable
 the train driver to watch the         
 passengers. This was intended to allow
 1 man trains but these{mirrors}caused 
 problems because of them misting up   
 and also freezing. Then heaters were  
 put on but they were not successful.  
   In the old goods yard there is an   
 aerial which is used as a radio link  
 between the driver of the train and   
 the signal box in case of emergency.  
{The Ponsbourne tunnel}south of the    
 station caused problems in that the   
 radio signal has to be bounced about  
 in the tunnel because of the bend in  
 it.
