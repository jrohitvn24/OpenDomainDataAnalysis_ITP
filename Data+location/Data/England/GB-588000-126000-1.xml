		<content>  Wittersham Village was covered with  
 forest until the Romans chopped the   
 trees down.  It is on the Isle of     
 Oxney which used to be an island and  
 some of it today is reclaimed         
 marshland. The village is small but   
 it has 2 pubs and 2 garages.  The Post
 Office is run by a lady who has been  
 here for 17 years.  There is an       
 Off-Licence, 2 antique shops, a food  
 store, a grain store and a coal yard. 
 There are several small businesses    
 including a hand made furniture       
 business, and a coach works which     
 mends and sprays cars.  It also has a 
 church and a Primary school.  Children
 of 11 and over go into Tenterden to   
 Homewood School. There is a Doctors'  
 Surgery in the village 3 afternoons a 
 week otherwise people have to go into 
 Tenterden.
