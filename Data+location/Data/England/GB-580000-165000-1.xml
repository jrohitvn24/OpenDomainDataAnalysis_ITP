E.of London.The town is sited at       
100 feet on the dip slope of the North

acres in 1871 to 1,698 in 1961 but the 
population has increased from 2,082 to 
10,101. There has been a rapid growth  
in population since 1961 and by 1971   
it was 15,758. The population is hard  
to estimate now as, in 1981, Rainham   
was included in the figure for

busiest commuter town in the Southern
