		<title>16Farming in World's End</title>
		<content>    The farming of the area is mostly  
 arable, with some pastoral. The main  
 crops are barley and corn. Hay-making 
 has become uncommon, as most of the   
 grassland is grazed or cut for silage.
 However, Common Market prices for     
 cereal crops have meant that it is    
 hardly worth growing such crops as    
 barley. One farm in particular has now
 turned to pig-farming, which is       
 proving very popular.                 
    The farmer nowadays has to be ready
 and willing to bend to market         
 forces.Recent milk quotas have already
 caused the disappearance of the cows  
 from the fields.                      
    One new crop has appeared;from     
 Germany came Trikkakalee.There are    
 small areas of woodland which are used
 for timber, and where game pheasants  
 are reared.
