		<content>    Daniel lives in a mill which is 800
 years old.It was bought four years ago
 as a ruin and turned into three       
 houses.All have three floors.Our one  
 has ground floor  kitchen, dining     
 room, utility room, hall, cloakroom   
 and living room. The boiler for the   
 oil central heating is in the kitchen.
 On the first floor are three bedrooms,
 a bathroom and study. The second floor
 has a huge room  with a loft. There is
 half an acre of land with several     
 trees and the Scarrow Beck at the     
 bottom of the garden.                 
 Kate lives in a house that was once a 
 Dame School and a garage. A man in the
 village remembers being taught there. 
 The garage was owned by Shot Reynolds 
 and the petrol tanks are still under  
 the front garden. The Cooke family who
 once owned Aldborough Mill also lived 
 in the house at some  time.           </content>
