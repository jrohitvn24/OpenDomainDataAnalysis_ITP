 Our Domesday block covers an area     
 approximately  15 km North-West of    
 Durham City in the North-East of      
 England .It is a rural area containing
 the small former mining village of    
{Burnhope}and the growing dormitory    
 village of{Lanchester.}Our block      
 contains some of the most beautiful   
 scenery in Durham County.Lanchester   
 is 114 metres above sea level while   
 Burnhope  is 258 metres above sea     
 level.                                
 The villages are surrounded by        
 farming land. Most of the farmers grow
 wheat,barley and grass and keep sheep 
 and cows.There are few employment     
 oportunites in our block.Many people  
 from Lanchester travel to             
 Durham and Newcastle to work.         
   We found many interesting and       
 exciting facts about our study.       </content>
