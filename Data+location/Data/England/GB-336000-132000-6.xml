		<content> The main land use is permanent pasture
 used for both beef and cattle and also
 for winter feed of both hay and       
 silage. Much of the land is near to,  
 or even below sea level, and          
 consequently in the winter months most
 of the cattle have to be housed in the
 farm buildings.  This land has to be  
 constantly drained and this drainage  
 is closely monitored because flooding 
 in such an area as this could be      
 disasterous. However, in winter it is 
 sometimes deliberately flooded to     
 relieve the pressure of water on the  
 nearby rivers and water channels.     
 Much of the higher ground is given    
 over to arable farming, the main crops
 being potatoes, wheat and barley.     
 There are occasional sundry crops of  
 oats, maize for silage, fodder beet   
 and other root vegetables.
