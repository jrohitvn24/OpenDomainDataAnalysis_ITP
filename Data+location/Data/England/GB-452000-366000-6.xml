 Q. Where does the coal go?            
 A. To Power Stations except 3% which  
 is concessionary.                     
 Q. How safe is the pit?               
 A. Not as safe as it should be.       
 Q. Have you ever found any            
 interesting fossils?                  
 A. Only mussels and ferns. Soon

 seam as Bolsover where the interesting
 fossils have been found.              
 Q. What facilities do you provide for 
 the comfort of the miners?

 Q. When was the last time a woman     
 worked at the pit?
