		<title>10A DYMCHURCH LANDSCAPE</title>
		<content> A network of dykes across Romney Marsh
 helps to save this low-lying area from
 flooding. The dykes are an important  
 part of our lives. We love their      
 changing moods and contrasting        
 characters. Dykes can be dirty and    
 dangerous, they are cleaned out by a  
 big crane, sludging through the smelly
 water. Some dykes are narrow and less 
 than one metre deep. These usually dry
 up in the Summer. Wider sections are  
 like a bright green carpet where we   
 can sail a dinghy. The dykes provide a
 home for fish, water flies, water     
 snails and all kinds of weeds. We     
 enjoy fishing from the banks for roach
 and tiddlers like stickleback and     
 minnows. Eels can be caught by pulling
 in weeds. Areas of the banks are      
 scattered with wild flowers, shaded by
 hawthorn and elderberry bushes.
