		<title>04ECOLOGY IN BOOTHBY PAGNELL</title>
		<content>    In Boothby there was evidence of   
 conservation,pollution and changes.   
 The conservation was in the form of   
 trees planted in hedgerows,possibly   
 replacing elms which had died of Dutch
 Elm disease.A bit of an eyesore was a 
 pile of old tyres which were the only 
 sign of pollution.Several cottages    
 had disappeared without trace.Many    
 paths were overgrown and some were    
 non_existent.Some merged into         
 water_filled ditches and became bogs.A
 field was being drained.A JCB digger  
 was stationary in the field,probably  
 being used to lay pipes.              
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
