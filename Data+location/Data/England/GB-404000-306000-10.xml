is increasing. Encourages people to be 
involved by organisations such as path-
finders, guides and Sunday School for  
younger people-choir for all ages, and 
groups of adults to help run Church    
activities. {St.Joseph's R.C.} Father  
would like younger people to attend.   
Increase in congregation with older    
people. Tries to popularize Church by  
activities such as barn dances and     
fairs. Tries to encourage children     
from St. Joseph's school to attend the 
Church. {PEOPLE'S ATTITUDES}-Young     
people believe in God, but few go to   
Church, except at Christmas, Easter    
and Weddings. More younger and middle  
aged adults attend church. Most felt   
that Religious Education should be     
taught in schools. Those aged 60 plus  
attended regularly, and had done so    
since young.                           </content>
