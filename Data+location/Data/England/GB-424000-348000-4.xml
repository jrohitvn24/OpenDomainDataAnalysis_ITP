		<content>  A lot of people buy the{Derby Evening
{Telegraph.}It is an evening paper. It 
 reports local news mostly, but also   
 has the important national and        
 international news. It has sport in it
 and a crossword and sometimes another 
 competition. It has the usual         
 advertisement columns.                
                                       
  There are two local weekly papers,   
 the{Ashbourne News Telegraph}and the  
{Matlock Mercury.}Slightly more people 
 have the{Matlock Mercury}than the     
{Ashbourne News Telegraph.}A few people
 have both. These just report local    
 events.                               
                                       
  The{Derbyshire Times}is a            
 weekly paper which reports events over
 the whole county. Not many people buy 
 this paper.
