		<content>{SAILING}We went sailing one day.I     
 steered and went round in a circle,but
 then I got the hang of it.It felt     
 funny.The sea went green when we went 
 up the river.The we saw the S.S.      
 Uganda, the old{Educational Cruise    
{ship.}She looked like a wedding cake  
 with marmalade on,because there was   
 rust on her.I saw a cormorant.It was  
 brown.He was drying his wings.He was  
 like a statue.When the boat swayed,you
 have to sway with it.We had to put the
 sails up and the boom hit me on the   
 head.We went past a buoy that smelt   
 horrible and we stopped at an         
 island.When we got off the boat my    
 legs felt funny.We had a good wind on 
 the way home.
