		<title>01GENERAL REVIEW,PURTON STOKE.</title>
		<content> At first we thought this was just a   
 rural area comprising{dairy farms,    
{grazing land }and{a small village.    
 Little cultivation is carried out as  
 the land is a heavy clay.The road from
 Purton to Cricklade runs through the  
 centre;to the east the area is bounded
 by the{River Ray},and to the west by  
 the{River Key.}Both these small rivers
 run into the Thames at Cricklade,  but
 the Ray consists largely of effluent  
 from Swindon sewage works while the   
 Key arises from pure springs.The      
 revival of the Swindon/Cricklade      
{Railway}provides a tourist attraction,
 while there is a little{fishing &amp; clay
{pigeon shooting}for locals.Most people
 must have cars as there is only one   
{bus}(to Wootton Bassett) each week.The
 village has not attracted new building
 or commuters,which is surprising as   
 Thamesdown is so near.                </content>
