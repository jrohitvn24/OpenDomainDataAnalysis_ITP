 We wanted to know what kinds of       
 domestic animals there are in our     
 survey area.We asked children aged    
 between 10 and 11 attending County    
 Primary Schools in our area this      
 question:What pets have your family?  
  The results showed the following     
 list: 17 dogs,5 cats,6 tortoise,5     
 rabbits, 6 horses,3 budgerigars,2     
 guinea pigs. 13 families had fish in  
 tanks and one had 3 frogs. Only three 
 families had no pets.   {DOMESTICATED 
 In our area farm animals consist      
 mainly of dairy cattle;Jersey and     
 Freisian;and young cattle reared      
 for beef. There are also some         
 sheep.Some people who have large      
 garden or extra acres keep goats and  
 poultrey-beacause they enjoy goat's   
 milk and fresh eggs.
