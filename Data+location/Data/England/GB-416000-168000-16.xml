		<title>16THE MAYOR SPEAKS (1)</title>
		<content> With ancient roots dating back to     
 1204, the Town Council is a repository
 of tradition in an era of rapid social
 change. In spite of the curtailment of
 the powers of Town Councils since the 
 Act of 1974, we take pride in our     
 regalia and in those who carry them.  
                                       
 At the Mayor-Making on May 13th.,     
 1985, I suggested that the theme of   
 the year should be that of looking    
 outwards, little guessing that within 
 days the town would be the centre of  
 interest of the media.  A "hippy"     
 convoy of some 100 vehicles sought    
 refuge in the Savernake Forest after a
 confrontation with the police near    
 Stonehenge. I went to the site, trying
 to be as inconspicous as possible in  
 dirty old jeans and a sweat shirt, but
 I felt myself overdressed in that     
 company.                              </content>
