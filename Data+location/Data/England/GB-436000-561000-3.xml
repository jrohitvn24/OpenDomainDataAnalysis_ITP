		<title>03WHITELEAS SHOPS,SO.SHIELDS</title>
		<content> The shops are situated in Whiteleas   
 Way on the Whiteleas Estate and are a 
 very important feature of life for    
 many local residents,(mainly old-age  
 pensioners),not only because of the   
 service it provides but because it    
 acts as a social meeting place too.   
    There are 15 shops altogether      
 covering the following services:      
{Post Office,newsagent,confectioner,   
{baker,butcher,chemist,greengrocer,    
{hairdresser,draper,off-licence,fish   
{and chip shop and mini-supermarket. } 
    The shopping area tends to be most 
 busy mid-morning,particularly the     
 baker,butcher and greengrocer.        
    Security does not seem to be a     
 problem amongst the shopkeepers.      
 Vandalism,however,is.At night, groups 
 of bored teenagers gather and cover   
 the shop fronts with graffiti.
