		<content>    Appleby Squash Courts are a part of
 the Appleby Football Club.The squash  
 courts are down Chapel Street,in the  
 football field.the chairman of the    
 squash courts is Mr. Mike Saint.When  
 you join the squash club you get a    
 key,so you can go in at anytime you   
 like.If you want to join the leagues  
 you have to visit Mr.Saint.When you   
 are in the leagues you play matches   
 and as you win matches you go up the  
 leagues. There are two courts with a  
 balcony above them.When your time is  
 up the lights automatically go off.The
 squash courts are open nearly all day 
 and until late at night.Men,women and 
 children can play.I play squash and   
 really enjoy it. In the club house    
 there are lots of other activities.You
 can hire a room for a party or a      
 disco.There are also dancing classes.
