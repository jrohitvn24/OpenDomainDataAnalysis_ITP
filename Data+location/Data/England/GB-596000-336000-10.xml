		<content>  It is extremely difficult to leave   
 the main roads when walking in the    
 village.The pattern of farming is such
 that there is only a small acreage of 
 meadows left and that is fenced off   
 for sheep or horses.                  
  Many footpaths have gone and even    
 minor roads have been labelled        
 private. There is little left of the  
 old village to conserve, many houses  
 have been altered or restored. The    
 hedgerows have been drastically       
 erased.                               
  It will be necessary to be much more 
 vigilant to preserve the few remaining
 footpaths and sideroads.              
  In an area of such cold winds,trees  
 and hedges are of special             
 significance.                         
 There is little pollution in the      
 streams and rivers, but spraying the  
 crops is posing a new threat.         </content>
