		<title>07Religion in Crockenhill</title>
		<content> Crockenhill is unusual in that the the
 Baptist Chapel was established before 
 the Anglican church.                  
 The Baptist Chapel was set up in 1801 
 in a blacksmith's premises in the     
 present Old Chapel Road and then moved
 to Eynsford Road in 1870.A school was 
 opened alongside and was the fore     
 runner of the Council School that was 
 opened in 1906.The Anglican Church was
 opened in 1852 and the building was   
 designed by Nash believed to have been
 related to the Nash who helped with   
 the design of Buckingham Palace.The   
 old wealthy families tended to support
 the Union Chapel but in the last 30   
 years many have left.Today about 40   
 people attend and the Boys Brigade has
 about 20  members.The Anglican Church 
 has about 50 members some of which    
 live outside the village but is       
 usually full for the main festivals.  </content>
