		<content> The most popular game in my village is
 'French Skipping".It is mainly played 
 by primary aged children.Each summer  
 the children buy some elastic,about 3 
 metres,but the longer the better.You  
 need 3 people at least to play the    
 game.You tie the elastic into a loop  
 then 2 people stand inside the elastic
 and stand well apart so that it       
 becomes taut.One person stands inside 
 with the elastic around their         
 ankles.They then jump out of the      
 elastic,with 1 leg over the right side
 and 1 over the left.The person then   
 jumps back in and out,and this is     
 repeated once more.The person then    
 leaves all together and then runs up  
 to it and puts 1 foot on either side  
 as they go.They can then go on to play
 'cross_overs','scissoring','thinsies' 
 and 'widesies'.
