		<content> Much of this part of southern Britain 
 is covered by mixed woodland, with    
 deciduous oak, beech, birch, alder and
 hazel as well as coniferous           
 plantations. There are all the common 
 wild flowers, a few rare early purple 
 orchids but the area is most famous   
 for its bluebells in the spring.      
 Badgers are not unknown  and fallow   
 deer are a nuisance, wandering in from
 the forest to eat crops and garden    
 produce. All the usual common rodents 
 (mice,rats,grey squirrels) as well as 
 shrews, voles,foxes and rabbits are   
 found in abundance. In the woods jays 
 are common, also nuthatches, sparrows,
 blue-tits,great-tits,robins, owls,    
 chaffinches and tree-creepers. There  
 are abundant fungi in the autumn.
