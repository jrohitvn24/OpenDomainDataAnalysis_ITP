		<content> There are 4 shops in our area. They   
 are all in Ewyas Harold. There is a   
 chemist, greengrocer's, butcher's and 
 an antique shop. The chemist's used to
 sell a lot of medicine but now it     
 sells things like gardening equipment,
 stationery, birthday cards and        
 household goods. The greengrocer's has
 a Post Office as part of it. The      
 things that they sell are fruit and   
 vegetables, a little meat and bread,  
 knitting equipment, cereals, tinned   
 food and sweets. The antique and      
 jeweller's shop is next door to "The  
 Dog" public house. The last shop is   
 the butcher's. There used to be a     
 baker's but this has recently         
 closed.Almost everybody in the village
 uses the local shops - over 40% use   
 them for almost all their shopping.
