 around{1968.}Two firemen every year   
 paint the rooms and ceilings.The Fire 
 Station consists of a small{kitchen,2 
{toilets}(male and female),and a{bar}  
 for meetings,clubs,etc. It also has a 
{lecture room,}a{muster bay,}a{watch   
{room,}and the{pump bay}to keep        
 the appliance in. Outside there is an 
 open space for cars, a{tower}for      
 practising ladder work, bike slots,and
 a lawn. There are 13 men who work as  
 firemen. Every now and again the fire 
 engine has to be overhauled, and      
 another engine is brought from        
{Peterborough.}All the firemen are     
{retained firemen,}who have other      
 full-time jobs. Each man recieves a   
 call by means of an{alerter}which they
 have near them at all times. It has a 
 red light and a bleeping sound which  
 goes off when there's a call.         </content>
