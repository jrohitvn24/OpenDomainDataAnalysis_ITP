		<title>06ECOLOGY - SHIRTCLIFF BROOK</title>
		<content>           Shirtcliff Brook is situated
 in a valley between Woodhouse and     
 Stradbroke. In the valley are many    
 trees and animals. The valley is      
 crawling with nature. There is a      
 nature trail which begins at Shubert  
 Bridge and ends up in Smelter Wood.   
 The brook is very shallow, about l4   
 cm deep, and contains little          
 amphibious life compared to the more  
 polluted area near the Badger         
 Estate.At one point ochre enters the  
 stream but does not pollute it.Housing
 estates will not be built because of  
 subsidence.Opposite the Severnside    
 area is an expanse of ground.This was 
 a mine but is now just an old piece of
 wasteland. You can still see the old  
 stones from the mine.
