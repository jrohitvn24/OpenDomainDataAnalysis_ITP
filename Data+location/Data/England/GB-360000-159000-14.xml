		<title>14CLUTTON -ROAD SAFETY</title>
		<content> We have a problem with road safety in 
 Clutton. We have to be careful when we
 come to and leave school and when we  
 ride our bikes. The main road through 
 the village is narrow and twisty.     
 There is only enough room for one lane
 of traffic in each direction. If      
 people park their cars then there is  
 little room for cars to pass. The road
 is often used by large lorries from   
 Bromilow's yard at the bottom of the  
 road. Many cars also go too fast along
 the road. We interviewed Mrs. Kingman 
 who is the crossing lady for Clutton  
 School. She has been working there for
 four years. She told us that the      
 children are good and donot run across
 the road. There have not been any     
 accidents yet but some near misses. We
 have planted trees to stop the balls  
 going over the school wall and        
 possibly causing accidents.           </content>
