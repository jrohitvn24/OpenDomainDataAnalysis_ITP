		<title>18MOUNT MASKALL 2 BOREHAM</title>
		<content> A fine brick barn, with wide bands of 
 mortar between the bricks, was built  
 in 1550. The barn stands today a      
 tribute to the builders.The house was 
 given a Georgian facade in 1746,Mount 
 Maskall was at that time part of the  
 New Hall estate.The building is well  
 proportioned. there is a fine oak beam
 above the fireplace in the hall. On   
 the walls of the hall is a hanging    
 showing the Arthur families Coat of   
 Arms,and 2 banners that were carried  
 by the trumpeters when the owner was  
 the High Sheriff of Essex in 1971.    
  The owner believes that Mount may be 
 a derivation of the word mott and that
 the original house may have been built
 on a man made mound surrounded by a   
 moat.Looking at the site this would   
 seem quite likely the pond adjacent to
 the house could be the remains of the 
 moat.Some fine water fowl live there. </content>
