		<title>02TATTING</title>
		<content> I go with Stanley White who lives next
 door but one. It's fun really because 
 you earn yourself a bit of money. We  
 go in a big van to different areas. we
 have to knock on the door and ask for 
 old newspapers, scrap metal or jumble.
 We then get back into the van and do  
 another street. we do so many streets 
 and then go home to have our dinner   
 and then go tatting again. When we    
 have finished we go home and help     
 unload the van and Stanley gives us   
 our money, which is about one pound.  
 He keeps his money in his tin box.
