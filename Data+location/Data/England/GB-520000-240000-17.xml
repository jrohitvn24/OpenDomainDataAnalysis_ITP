		<title>17HINXWORTH'S SOCIAL CONCERNS</title>
		<content> Since we are a rural community most of
 the things which concern us are to do 
 in some way with the environment.Every
 year tempers are roused when the straw
{stubble is burnt off}resulting in the 
 pollution of the atmosphere, the      
 destruction of trees and hedges by    
 "accident", and black smuts in many   
 houses. Another thing which people are
 becoming increasingly worried about is
 the proliferation of the{aerial spray-
{ing}of crops with dangerous chemicals 
 causing damage to wildlife and people 
 who inadvertently come into contact.  
 Again there is the tendency of farmers
 to grub up{hedges and footpaths}to    
 make fields larger and easier to man- 
 age for large machinery.The other main
 concern we have in the village is the 
 lack of a{speed limit}which has resul-
 ted in the death of one young boy; we 
 have campaigned to no avail as yet.   </content>
