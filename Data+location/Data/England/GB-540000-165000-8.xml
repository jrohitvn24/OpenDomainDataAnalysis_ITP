		<content>   A Secondary school pupil is not yet 
 taught by computers but by adults.    
 The adults must have a degree in the  
 subject they are teaching. However,   
 many of the existing teachers do not  
 have a degree.                        
   The subjects available to be studied
 in this school are:-                  
 Maths,English,French,Spanish,German,  
 Latin,Geography,History,Art,Religious 
 Education,Chemistry,Biology,Physics,  
 and Crafts. Project Technology is also
 avalaible in the 4th year onwards.    
   We are only allowed to opt for five 
 subjects from this list excluding     
 Maths and English (literature and     
 language) which are compulsory.       
    For this reason many of the pupils 
 are restricted as career problems may 
 stop them doing Computer Studies and  
 other practical subjects.
