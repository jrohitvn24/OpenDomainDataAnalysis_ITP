		<title>08LIFE IN ENGLAND</title>
		<content> My name is Jean Paano and I come from 
 the Phillippines.I am 10 years old.   
 When I was two years old my parents   
 went to England to find work.They     
 worked for the Earl of Yarborough.    
 Every two years they would come home  
 to visit us. I lived with my Grandma. 
 In 1983 my parents took us to live in 
 England.I didn't like flying in an    
 aeroplane. I felt sick.               
 I enjoy living in England as I have   
 plenty of friends at school.I can     
 speak and read English very well as we
 were these subjects in the Phillipines
 During the summer holidays we are all 
 flying home to see my relations. I am 
 looking forward to this very much.    
 Life in this country is very different
 as it is very cold during the winter. 
 The children are very kind though some
 make rude comments about my colour.
