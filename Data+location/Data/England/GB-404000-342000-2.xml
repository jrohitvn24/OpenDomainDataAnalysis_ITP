		<title>02SCENERY AROUND ALTON</title>
		<content>The scenery in this part of the Churnet
Valley is the most attractive in       
Staffordshire.Millstone Grit forms the 
rounded hills which rise above Farley  
while the remainder of the high ground 
is produced by New Red Sandstone which 
gives the typical brown-red pebbly     
sandstone outcrops.Hilly landscape is  
produced by the steep- sided stream    
valleys and dry valleys, (formed during
the Ice Age), cutting through the      
sandstones.The River Churnet is the    
main feature with a steep sided valley 
enclosing a 200 metre wide flat floor, 
filled with alluvium.Buildings add to  
the attractiveness of the landscape.   
Alton Castle towers above the valley so
earning it the title of"The Rhineland  
 of Staffordshire".The ruined shell of 
Alton Towers,built by the Earl of      
Shrewsbury,and now being restored,comes
into view from many vantage points.    </content>
