		<title>09The Brownies</title>
		<content> Brownies is a popular girls' club: the
{uniform}is a{brown dress, yellow tie  
 and a{bobble hat}.After three weeks   
{you}get enrolled at Brownies. That    
 night you have to stand by a mirror   
 and say."Twist me and turn me and show
 me the elf, I looked in the water and 
 there saw myself".Then you look for a 
 badge and take it to the{pack leader  
{(Brown Owl)}and say,{"I promise that I
{will do my best to do my duty to God, 
{to serve the Queen and help other     
{people and to keep the Brownie Guide  
{law".}Then she gives you your badges. 
 At Brownies you play a lot of games   
 and learn lots of songs.              
 When you leave Brownies at 10 years   
 you can join the Guides. There are    
 several Cub packs and Scout Troops for
 boys in Exmouth to join if they want  
 to.
