		<content> Housing has developed alongside the   
 colliery.   The original development  
 was of a ribbon nature.   After the   
 1939/45 war the Kiveton Park Rural    
 District {Council}built two large     
 blocks of {Council} housing.   In the 
 late sixties a large area of {Coal    
{Board }property was built with a local
 nickname of{White City.  }This can be 
 attributed to the nature of           
 construction- large slabs of white    
 concrete bolted together.   This      
 accommodation was used to house an    
 influx of workers from Scotland and   
 Wales from worked out pits to one with
 a future.   From 1983 to 1985 two     
 areas of {private} development have   
 taken place.   The majority of the    
 people who reside in this new property
 travel outside Kiveton to work in     
 Worksop, Sheffield and Rotherham.
