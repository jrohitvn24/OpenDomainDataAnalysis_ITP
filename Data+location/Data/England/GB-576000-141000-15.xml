		<content>   Sir Harry and Lady Mary Hoare lived 
 in the old manor but Lady Mary became 
 very ill and Sir Harry decided that   
 the manor was too low down and that it
 was the damp that collected in the    
 area that made it so unhealthy so he  
 built Iden Manor on the hill.         
  Both Iden Manor and Old Manor are now
 used by the nuns of St.Mary's Convent.
 The old manor accommodates the elderly
 nuns some of whom are one hundred     
 years old. The main work of St. Mary's
 Convent up to a few years ago was the 
 care of disturbed girls but they now  
 work with older women some of whom    
 they help to overcome alcohol problems
   The nuns have recently sold Iden    
 Lake and Lake House and put the money 
 towards the church. The chapel at St. 
 Mary's convent is used  for worship by
 Staplehurst's Roman Catlolic community
