		<title>10LAW AND ORDER WEST FLEGG</title>
		<content> The Police uniform today is a blue    
 shirt, tie, jacket and trousers, they 
 wear a flat cap for casual work and a 
 helmet for when they are on the beat. 
 The cars they use have changed rapidly
 because cars used for crime have got  
 faster.                               
 Crime doubles when the holiday makers 
 come. The most common crime is cars   
 being stolen but there is also        
 criminal damage.In our area we have   
 got one policewoman and four          
 policemen.                            
 The police don't go round on the beat 
 in our area,they patrol the area using
 cars.In our area the accident Black   
 Spot is on the corner going to Gibbet 
 Hill because it is a very sharp bend  
 and people speeding crash very        
 easily.Our rural area has a very low  
 crime rate compared with cities.
