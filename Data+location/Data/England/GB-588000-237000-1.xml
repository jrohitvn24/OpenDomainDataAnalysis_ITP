   The major part of the area surveyed 
by our school comprises the village of 
Little Cornard, although the north-west
corner of the area encompasses part of 
the neighbouring village of Great      
Cornard.The River Stour runs           
through the south west corner of the   
area.The Stour valley has been         
designated an area of outstanding      
natural beauty.At the boundary of the  
two villages is a nature conservation  
area known as Cornard Mere.            
   There is a single track railway line
which runs from Sudbury to Marks Tey - 
the nearest station being at Sudbury   
(two miles).There is a regular bus     
service from Bury St. Edmunds to       
Colchester.Buses stop on the Bures Road
in both Little and Great Cornard.
