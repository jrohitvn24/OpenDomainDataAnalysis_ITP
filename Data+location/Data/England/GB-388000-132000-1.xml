		<title>01A DESCRIPTION OF OUR AREA</title>
		<content>{We}live in a place which is mostly    
 fields, woods and steep hills. The    
 woods have lots of{wildlife}including 
 deer. There are quite a few farms.    
{There}are two main villages,{Chicklade
 and{Hindon.}A very busy road has been 
 built right through Chicklade. Hindon 
 used to be on a very busy road until  
 they built the new road. Hindon is    
 very quiet. It has a pub called the   
{Lamb}which has a lot of visitors      
 including foreign tourists. The food  
 is said to be good there.             
 We are close to{Salisbury Plain,      
{Stonehenge}and{Longleat. Shaftesbury, 
 which is not far from us, was used to 
 film a Hovis bread advertisement      
 because it has a very steep cobbled   
 street which is pretty.               
 Hindon was built in the 13th century  
 and was quite important until the rail
 ways came to Tisbury.                 </content>
