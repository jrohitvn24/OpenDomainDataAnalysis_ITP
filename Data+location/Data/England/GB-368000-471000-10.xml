		<title>10Shopping in Ingleton</title>
		<content> There are two bakeries in Ingleton    
 there is one near the village centre  
 and there is one in the middle of the 
 village. They sell bread and Cornish  
 pasties. A Cornish pastie has pastry  
 round the outside the filling is      
 mashed up patato, sliced carrots and  
 mincemeat.They also sell sausage rolls
 which are made out of crumbly pastry  
 with a sausage in the middle. They    
 sell cream buns and lots of other     
 cakes.In the other bakery they sell   
 more or less the same things but they 
 sell crisps and drinks.There are three
 general stores, they sell all the     
 things you want but sometimes they run
 out of things or they become too dear 
 so you have to travel all the way to  
 Lancaster or Morecambe.The general    
 stores all sell cigarettes,cigars and 
 matches.                              
                                       </content>
