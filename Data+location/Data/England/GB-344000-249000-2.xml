		<content>  The houses range from 14_18th century
{timber-framed}to modern{brick}.There  
 are some stone houses, especially at  
 Westhope.A copy of a timber-framed    
 house has recently been built.Many of 
 the{timber-famed, wattle and daub     
{panelled cottages}were originally     
 four-roomed agricultural dwellings.In 
 the 1830's there seems to have been a 
 spate of modernisations, with brick   
 replacing some of the timber-framing. 
 In the last 20 years many cottages    
 have been modernised and extended.    
 Westhope has been{repopulated}because 
 many of the{derelict cottages}have    
 been made into very acceptable homes. 
 Westhope houses, typical of unplanned 
{Common Land}development, were probably
 erected in one day.Some cottage deeds 
 give owners{grazing-rights}on the     
 Common.Present{planning policy}seems  
 to allow only agricultural dwellings. </content>
