  It was opened in 1977 costing Â£8.9   
 million.Between then and 1982,1034    
 conferences and exhibitions had been  
 held,attracting 185,000 delegates and 
 visitors spending Â£32.4 million in the
 economy.The average spending of an    
 overseas delegate in 1981 was Â£240_47%

 Brighton Centre adds Â£10 to the rates 
 of every rate_payer in Brighton per   
 year to finish paying off the cost of 
 building the centre.                  
  Also a lot of pop concerts are held  
 at the centre bringing in quite a lot 
 of money to the town.There are already
