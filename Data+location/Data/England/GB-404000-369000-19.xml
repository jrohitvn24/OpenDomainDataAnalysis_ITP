		<title>19A HARPUR HILL GIRL'S DAY</title>
		<content>{                                      
 My name is{Amanda Baker} and I am the 
 only girl in this group to live in    
 Harpur Hill. I live at{55 Fernydale   
{Avenue}in a council house which we    
 have bought. It has 3 bedrooms. I get 
 up at 7.30 and leave for school at    
 8.00. We go to the shop on the way and
 buy sweets. At school we have 2       
 lessons of 35 minutes and then 20     
 minutes break. After 2 more lessons it
 is lunch time. There are four more    
 lessons in the afternoon and another  
 break. I leave school as quickly as I 
 can at 3.45pm. and walk back through  
 the woods. After school I always take 
 my dogs up to Solomon's Temple. They  
 run around and I look at the view. I  
 go to my nanna's and go home for 9pm  
 I like to watch TV at night but not   
 doing my homework. I go to bed late.
