		<title>01Rural area including Blunts</title>
		<content> A typical example of rural Cornwall   
 with scattered farms producing crops  
 and keeping dairy cattle. The hamlet  
 of Blunts has a few houses, a village 
 hall and although it used to boast two
 places of worship, only one chapel    
 remains. The River Tiddy runs from the
 NE to the SE of the area.A web of tiny
 lanes all over the area make access   
 between the farms and fields easy and 
 also to the main A38 trunk road       
 which is just outside this block to   
 the south.  This road is the main     
 'artery' between Cornwall and Devon   
 with Plymouth only 20 minutes to the  
 east and the county town of Truro     
 approx. One hour to the west.         
 The majority of the inhabitants of the
 area will be employed in farming      
 although with Plymouth only a few     
 miles away the opportunity to commute 
 to the city is a welcome option.      </content>
