		<title>02DAIRY FARMING_THE FLOSHES</title>
		<content>   Floshes Farm has 113 acres of       
 land.The farm has been in Mrs.Nelson's
 family for 46 years.They have about   
 250 Friesian cows. They keep 75 for   
 milking,60 for fattening,35 for       
 replacements and the remainder are    
 stirks.They also grow barley which    
 they use for cattle food.Four people  
 work on the farm,Mr. Nelson,his 2 sons
 and 1 girl student.                   
 The farmer works long hours.In winter 
 he starts work at 6-15a.m. and        
 finishes at about 6-00 p.m. but in the
 summer he sometimes does not finish   
 until 10-00 p.m. At calving time he   
 can often be up all night.            
 Mr.Nelson would like more land because
 he has to bid for extra grazing land  
 at an auction. He says that dairy     
 farming is more productive than it    
 used to be.He has all the machinery   
 he needs except a combine harvester.  </content>
