		<title>10FARMING - SULLINGTON</title>
		<content> Farming in Sullington is typified by  
 the farmstead at the foot of the      
 downs. Several acres of higher land   
 have been reclaimed and are now       
 included in fiftyeight percent crop   
 producing land.  The lower slopes     
 provide grazing for cattle, mainly    
 Fresian, but compared with former days
 there are few sheep.  Rape seed oil is
 a new crop being tried.  Full use is  
 made of the latest types of tractor   
 and combine harvesters.  Horses are   
 very much a thing of the past. Several
 farmers are seriously thinking of     
 installing computers but problems are 
 dealt with by the Ministry of         
 Agriculture. Generally the farmers are
 not in favour of the Common Market,   
 one comment being that the politician 
 tends to think about sixty years ahead
 while the farmer is running a business
 today.                                </content>
