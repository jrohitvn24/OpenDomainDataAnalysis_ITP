		<title>19TONGE MILL</title>
		<content>   There has been a watermill at Tonge 
 for 900 years. The present building   
 was erected in 1837. The gears and    
 waterwheel were removed and the stream
 diverted. The building later became   
 Wick's bakery. In 1970 the mill was   
 converted to accommodate two families 
 who run a craft centre and tea shop.  
 The craft shop sells pottery,         
 embroidery, pictures, jewelry and     
 other craft items made locally. There 
 is also a display of bygones.         
 Reproduction furniture is also sold.  
 The tea shop occupies what was        
 formerly a stable. The picturesque    
 mill pond with its variety of wild    
 life attracts many visitors. The pond 
 is fed by a stream that rises on the  
 north east side of the A2 road. Tonge 
 is especially busy at weekends.
