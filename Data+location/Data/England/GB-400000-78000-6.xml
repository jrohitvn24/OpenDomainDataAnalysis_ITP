		<title>06RELIGION PURBECK HOUSE</title>
		<content>   There are 9 Christian religions in  
 Swanage today. Purbeck House belongs  
 to the Sisters of Mercy R.C. nuns.    
   George Burt built Purbeck House     
 in 1875. It is typical of 2nd class   
 taste with it's Scottish baronial     
 style dominating the High St. The     
 Sisters of Mercy bought the house in  
 1935 and have just celebrated their   
 50th anniversary. They contribute to  
 the quality of life in Swanage by     
 helping the sick, poor and            
 handicapped. They visit the sick and  
 elderly and help in the Local Day     
 Centre. Here the elderly can meet     
 one another and be given a hot meal.  
   Apart from doing voluntary work the 
 Sisters teach in St. Mary's First     
 School which is in the grounds of     
 Purbeck House. One Sister nurses in   
 Swanage Cottage Hospital and another  
 Sister teaches in Wimborne.           </content>
