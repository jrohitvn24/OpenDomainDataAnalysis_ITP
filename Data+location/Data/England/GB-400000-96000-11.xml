		<title>11HOUSING IN CANFORD MAGNA.</title>
		<content> When Lord Wimborne built Canford House
 in Victorian days the village of Can- 
 ford Magna grew up around it,though   
 there are some newer houses there now.
 At Oakley Hill the Merley Way houses  
 were built between the 1st.&amp; 2nd.World
 Wars,but most of the other houses have
 been built during the last l5yrs,when 
 there has been a big building prog-   
 ramme &amp; a complete alteration in the  
 area.Nearly all owner-occupied,the    
 modern houses are well planned and    
 attractive.There is a small council   
 estate in Selkirk Close which includes
 some property specially planned for   
 old people.Near the small Oakley      
 shopping centre is some terraced      
 property,but mostly we have detached &amp;
 semi-detached houses &amp; bungalows.In   
 nearly every dwelling either a garage 
 or parking space is included.Gardens  
 are well tended,bright &amp; attractive.  </content>
