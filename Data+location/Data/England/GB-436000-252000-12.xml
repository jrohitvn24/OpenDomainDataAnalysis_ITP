{  Youth Club}is a place where you can 
 go to meet your friends and is        
 something to do.The youth club starts 
 at six o clock but most people come   
 around sevenish.The games you can     
 play are darts,snooker,table-tennis   
 and pool. Most people play table_     
 tennis and pool but I play football   
 with a sponge ball.                   
  Cans of coke cost 20p.The organisers 
 let every-one do what they want and   
 thats good.They've got a stereo and   
 they play records by Duran-Duran, Phil
 Collins, Wham, Elton John, Paul       
 Hardcastle, Michael Jackson and       
 Culture Club. It's 30p a week and     
 60p membership a year.Everyone has a  
 great time.
