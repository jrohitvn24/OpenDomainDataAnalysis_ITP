		<title>10NEWBOLD SCHOOL</title>
		<content> Newbold School has forty              
 children.Twenty come from Newbold     
 itself,the rest coming from the       
 surrounding villages,which are        
 Armscote,Wimpstone,Blackwell,         
 Tredington and Idlicote.The school was
 founded in 1847,making it 138 years   
 old.The children start at Newbold     
 School at the age of four and a half  
 years and leave when eleven.They will 
 go on to the secondary schools either 
 at Shipston,Kineton or Stratford,or to
 King Edward the Seventh Grammar school
 for Boys or Shottery Grammar School   
 for Girls in Stratford.               
   There are no aids for children to   
 cross the busy main road.The entrance 
 is in Moss Lane.There is no school    
 bus,the children arrive on foot,on    
 bicycles and in cars.                 
 The school is soon going to merge with
 Tredington School.                    </content>
