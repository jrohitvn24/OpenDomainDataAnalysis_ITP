		<title>05A SPORTS SHOP IN A-IN-M</title>
		<content> Malcolm Brown a former P.E. teacher at
 Cansfield High School decided to set  
 up a shop in the centre of Ashton.    
 His shop took over K &amp; B Sports.      
         He started off a small scale  
 business which grew larger and larger,
 importing foreign makes such as       
 Sergio Tachini and Kangaroo gear      
 which is very expensive and  can be   
 made specially for the buyer.         
       Recently the Silk Cut Challenge 
 Rugby Cup was held and Malcolm devoted
 his shop to Wigan who successfully    
 defeated Hull 28-24.  Malcolm's       
 Wigan hats and scarves  were          
 completely sold out and also his      
 Wigan shirts.                         
       Malcolm sells a wide range of   
 both rugby and soccer balls .He also  
 has a wide range of trainers like     
 Adidas, Nike, Patrick, Hi-tech, and   
 Puma.                                 </content>
