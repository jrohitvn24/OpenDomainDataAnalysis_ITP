		<title>18EAST LEAKE TUG-OF-WAR</title>
		<content> For one evening in the Summer the     
 Village Green is taken over by East   
 Leake Bantams Football Club who       
 organise a Tug-of-War competition.A   
 wide brook runs through the green     
 which is opposite St.Mary's Church and
 teams pull across it,the losers       
 getting a soaking.                    
 The evening commences with a Grand    
 Procession of floats containing       
 members of clubs and societies in     
 fancy dress.Traffic in the village now
 comes to a virtual standstill as      
 hundreds of people view the procession
 which finishes at the village green.  
 There are stalls of all               
 kinds:-games,food etc.and people flock
 from all around to join in the fun.   
 The local public house,The Three      
 Horseshoes(the original building was  
 the village smithy)does a roaring     
 trade.                                </content>
