 THERE ARE THREE FARMHOUSES, BUT ONLY  
 ONE IS A WORKING FARM, SYDMONTON FARM.
 THE HOUSE IS 18th CENTURY. IT HAS NOT 
 BEEN ALTERED RECENTLY. NUTHANGER IS A 
 VERY OLD BUILDING AND MUST HAVE BEEN  
 ALTERED MANY TIMES. IT CONTAINS A WELL
 ROOM. NO ALTERATIONS HAVE BEEN MADE TO
 THE OUTSIDE RECENTLY. WATERSHIP HAS   
 LONG BEEN A PRIVATE HOUSE. THE MAIN   
 FRONT LOOKS VICTORIAN. THE COTTAGES   
 HAVE ALL BELONGED TO SYDMONTON ESTATE 
 BUT SEVERAL ARE NOW OWNER OCCUPIED AND
 HAVE RECENT EXTENSIONS AND            
 IMPROVEMENTS LIKE BATHROOMS AND       
 ELECTRICITY. SYDMONTON COURT IS       
 PROBABLY 16th CENTURY AND HAD BEEN IN 
 THE SAME FAMILY FOR SEVERAL           
 GENERATIONS UNTIL THE LAST DECADE WHEN
 IT WAS SOLD SEPARATELY FROM THE       
 ESTATE.THE STABLE BLOCK IS NOW A HOUSE
