 MANY FARMS IN THE AREA ARE OWNED BY   
 OLD PEOPLE AND HAVE BEEN PASSED FROM  
 GENERATION TO GENERATION.MOST OF THE  
 FARMS IN THE AREA OWNED SEVERAL       
 DOZEN ACRES BUT MANY OF THEM HAVE NOW 
 BEEN SOLD TO PRIVATE OWNERS AND ARE   
 USED AS SMALL HOLDINGS FOR GRAZING    
 HORSES.MANY OF THE FARMS IN OUR AREA  
 CULTIVATE GRASS FOR HAY AND SILAGE    
 BUT SOME PEOPLE USE THEIR FIELDS FOR  
 GRAZING CATTLE. THE MAIN LIVESTOCK    
 IN THE FIELDS WERE HORSES, COWS       
 AND A FEW SHEEP. MOST OF THE PLACES   
 THAT WE VISITED WERE OLD AND SOME WERE
 EVEN IN RUINS.
