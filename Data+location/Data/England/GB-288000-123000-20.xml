		<content>  Two people believed in ghosts; in one
 house two seperate visitors felt a    
 benign presence in one room. On the   
 turnpike road, at a filling station   
 originally a Posthouse, the ghost of a
 cavalier had been seen-a happy ghost; 
 he and a dog were seen by a daughter  
 on another occasion-these were not    
 local people. When walls were demol-  
 ished in two old farmhouses, an       
 eagle's foot was found-intended to    
 ward off evil spirits.                
  One farmer would never hit a cow with
 a rowan stick. Many burn ashen faggots
 at Christmas. Owners of one farm had  
 been told by previous owners not to   
 touch a noose hanging from a beam in  
 the barn, on pain of bad luck; suppos-
 edly, a 93 year old man had hanged    
 himself after being involved with a   
 young girl-no evidence for it, but    
 they have never touched the rope.     </content>
