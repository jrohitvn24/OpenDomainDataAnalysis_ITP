		<title>18BILLINGTON MANOR</title>
		<content>  Billington Manor stands on a site    
 which still has ditch and bank        
 remaining after iron age occupation.  
  The present manor was built in the   
 17th century, modernized in 1881,     
 with work still going on at the       
 present time.                         
  The deeds granting manor rights and  
 signed by Henry viii are retained by  
 the present owners. The house is now  
 divided into four parts, the main part
 ooccupied by the owners and three     
 flats let with separate leases to     
 elderly members of the family.        
  The garden covers five acres and was 
 neglected for many years until the    
 present owners moved in in 1975 and   
 started the restoration. Many trees   
 were lost with Dutch Elm disease and  
 the shrubbery suffered through        
 neglect. Now a tree surgeon regularly 
 attends to the remaining trees.       </content>
