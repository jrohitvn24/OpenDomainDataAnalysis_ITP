		<title>15Kettlethorpe Livestock Farms</title>
		<content> Farmers keep a certain number of      
 livestock, mainly beef cattle         
 (Charolais crossbreed) and some sheep 
 and pigs. They spend the summer       
 grazing in the fields and are taken   
 into the barns and yards for winter.  
 Animals are eventually sold at Newark 
 and Gainsborough markets. Crops go to 
 local grain buyers and the sugar beet 
 factory at Bardney.                   
 The main fears in connection with the 
 animals are Foot and Mouth disease,   
 Swine Vesicular disease and Bowel     
 worm. The latter can be controlled by 
 injection, but entry into farms is    
 restricted, to prevent the disease    
 spreading, as whole herds have to be  
 destroyed should infection occur.     
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
