 240200 The River Trent crosses the N W
 corner of this square.On the north    
 bank is a meadow and on the south a   
 belt of trees,bushes and rough grass  
 land.South of this again is a field of
 barley called the Verge.              
 In the N E corner is a section of the 
 Stapenhill Council Estate,consisting  
 of semi-detatched houses and streets  
 such as Cumberland Road and Norfolk   
 Road named after counties.The Estate  
 is bounded on the south by the        
 embankment of the Burton to Leicester 
 railway,now only used by coal trains  
 from South Derbyshire and             
 Leicestershire collieries.            
 The Stapenhill to Walton Lane is used 
 by people from the Burton district who
 work at Drakelow Power Station.
