 school on the 26th of April 1985.We   
 had a service.Mr Evans and the top    
 year made a stole for the Bishop.It   
 had angels on, and Saint Michael. We  
 made the lunch, it was chicken and    
 prawn salad, and for sweet it was     
 chocolate mousse. The Bishop came to  
 school to meet people in the Wath     
 Deanery. About 80 people came to our  
 service, which is usually attended    
 by children and a few parents.We also 
 provided the wine for communion. On
