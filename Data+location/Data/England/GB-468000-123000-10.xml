 Life in this picturesque village has  
 changed little over the past fifty    
 years. Agriculture is the major       
 landcover, and only changes in land   
 usage have been significant. The land 
 was originally owned by Squire William
 Nicholson, but was divided up in      
 1945. Before him it had been owned by 
 the Sylvester family since the time   
 of Henry VII. Mechanisation created   
 rural unemployment, so commuters      
 have come to live in Froxfield Green. 
 Farm labourers used to live, and die, 
 in the service of the landowner.      
 Attitudes have also changed though    
 politically it has remained staunchly 
 Conservative. The village green used  
 to have a village shop but this closed
 recently. It is an area which has not 
 changed for many years.               </content>
