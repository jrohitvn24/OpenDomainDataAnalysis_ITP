		<title>07Clock Tower - Sheerness</title>
		<content>  {The clock tower}was built by the    
 Urban District Council to commemorate 
 the coronation in 1902 of Edward VII  
 and Queen Alexandra and has become a  
 feature of the town{landscape.}It was 
 placed at the bottom of Edward Street 
 now called The Broadway.              
   The tower is situated on a concrete 
 island in the centre of the one way   
{traffic}system. It is the focal point 
 of the town, used as a landmark.      
 During the festive season the clock is
 boarded up while music is played.     
   It was first restored in June 1977  
 for the{Silver Jubilee}celebrations   
 for the Queen.                        
   Recently the tower has been         
 repainted in red, white, brown and    
 ochre which has aroused many comments 
 from the local people.
