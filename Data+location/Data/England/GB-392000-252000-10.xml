		<content> The area is sparsely populated, the   
 total inhabitants numbering less than 
 700, of which 350 are concentrated in 
 Upton Snodsbury. Most of the residents
 who are in employment work outside the
 area, commuting to Birmingham,        
 Worcester,Redditch &amp; Pershore. Those  
 working locally are mainly employed in
 agriculture, but owing to the         
 mechanization of farming methods      
 numbers have fallen dramatically in   
 the last 40 years. One farm which had 
 20 employees then now has 4. A small  
 number work in the two local garages  
 and the public houses. There are a    
 great many retired persons in the     
 area; some have chosen to come to this
 lovely area and others have continued 
 to live where they spent their working
 lives, many in agriculture. Young     
 unmarrieds tend to move away; some    
 return with young families.           </content>
