 CLOSED AND EVERYONE ELSE HIDES.THEN   
 THE COUNTER LOOKS FOR THOSE WHO ARE   
 HIDING.THE COUNTER AND HIDERS RACE TO 
 BE FIRST BACK TO THE LURKY POST.TIG IS
 ANOTHER POPULAR GAME.IT IS A CHASING  
 GAME.SOMETIMES WE ALL BRING ROLLER    
 BOOTS AND PLAY TIG ON ROLLER BOOTS.THE
 BOYS OFTEN PLAY FOOTBALL AND THEY HAVE
 TWO SMALL GOALPOSTS.WE HAVE TO BE     
 CAREFUL WITH BALL GAMES BECAUSE THE   
 RAILWAY IS SO NEAR.THE YOUNGER        
 CHILDREN PLAY A LOT OF PRETEND GAMES  
 BASED ON TELEVISION PROGRAMMES OR     
 FILMS.THEY RACE AROUND PRETENDING TO  
 BE HE MAN OR SOMEONE OUT OF STARWARS.
