		<content> Hillside is east of Odiham and south  
 of the A287 Farnham road. The primary 
 land cover is pasture land, with areas
 of rough grazing land. At Bullock's   
 Farm, maize and hay are used as fodder
 The farm-labourers cottages built in  
 1896,around Hillside, have been       
 converted into large country houses.  
 Bullock's Farm and Hillside Farm were 
 built in 1981. Hillside is the larger 
 farm. Hillside Farm has a number of   
 small lakes, some natural and others  
 man-made. The disused chalk pits      
 belong to both Bullock's Farm and     
 Hillside Farm. They have existed since
 1830. One chalk pit is completely over
 grown with vegetation. The other pit  
 is used for dumping the wheat-chaff.  
 Local people use the slopes in winter 
 for sledging. The gas station is used 
 as a storage base by maintenance men.
