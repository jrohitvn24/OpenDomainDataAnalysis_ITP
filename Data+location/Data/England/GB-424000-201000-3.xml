		<title>03The Hedgerow around Langford</title>
		<content>  We measured a ten metre section of   
the hedgerow alongside one of the roads
leading into Langford.We found out what
kind of plants were growing in each    
metre of the section.We identified     
three parts:the hedge,the wild uncut,  
and the regularly cut grass.           
  The hedge consisted of birch bushes  
with elder, dogrose and bramble.       
  The wild uncut section was mainly    
great willowherb with nettles, goose-  
grass, convolvulus, some wild hop and  
white bryony.                          
  The cut grass verge next to the road 
was meadow grass with other types of   
grasses, silverweed, hogweed, thistles,
small convolvulus and a section of     
black medick, buttercup, clover, common
vetch, cow parsley, yarrow, sow thistle
, dock, ground ivy, speedwell, plantin,
forget-me-nots and dandelion.
