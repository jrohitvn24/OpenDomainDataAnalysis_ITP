		<title>19Stansted's Castle.</title>
		<content> To the east of the picturesque village
 of Stansted Mountfitchet stands the   
 remains of a castle.                  
 It is believed that the site dates    
 back to the Bronze Age,and many Bronze
 and Iron Age relics have been found.  
 The Vikings and Saxons developed a    
 setlement including a garrison castle 
 to defend the Roman crossroads.By 1086
 the settlement included 140 sheep,20  
 pigs and 8 slaves.The original castle 
 was made of oak from the local        
 forest.Over the years many examples of
 Roman pottery  and cannonballs from   
 Cromwellian times have been found.    
 The site now is privately owned and   
 construction is underway to develop a 
 scaled working settlement which will  
 be{the only one of its kind in the    
{world.}The end product will include   
 animals,working crafts and a museum   
 displaying valuable many finds.       </content>
