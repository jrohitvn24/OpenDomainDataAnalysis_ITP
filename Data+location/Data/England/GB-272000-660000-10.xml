		<title>10BELLSHILL TOWN CENTRE</title>
		<content>{Main Street}is the main shopping area 
 of Bellshill. However,because of      
 better and bigger shopping facilities 
 provided elsewhere, like ASDA in      
 Coatbridge,and the shopping centres in
 Hamilton and Motherwell have drawn    
 many people away from the Bellshill   
 shopping areas.                       
 A Council approved survey in 1979     
 showed that local residents did 36%   
 of their shopping in Bellshill Town   
 centre,20% in local neighbourhood     
 shops and 44% outside the area.       
 However the building of a supermarket 
 for FineFare has brought back many    
 shoppers to the Main Street. With     
 this new development and the building 
 now completed at the corner of Emma   
 Jay Road there is now 16,500 Square   
 feet of commercial floorspace         
 available in Bellshill Town centre.
