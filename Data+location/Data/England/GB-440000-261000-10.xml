		<title>10Parish Church of Southam</title>
		<content>  St. James Church spire is often the  
 first thing people see as they        
 approach Southam. The church was built
 in the 14th century, replacing another
 church built in 1220. In pre-         
 Reformation days it was a Catholic    
 church. The last mass to be said there
 was in about 1547.                    
  Below the spire (attributed to the   
 perpendicular style) is the belfry    
 which houses 8 bells used for worship 
 and celebration. The people of Southam
 were in disgrace when Charles 1st     
 visited the town as the church bells  
 weren't rung to celebrate his arrival.
 The parish was fined and the church   
 doors were locked as a punishment.    
  Inside the church is an old chest    
 which kept the Parish records. There  
 also remains a cannon ball from the   
 battle of Southam. The church is used 
 for concerts, recitals and festivals. </content>
