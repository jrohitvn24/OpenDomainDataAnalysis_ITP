		<content>    In the{Meadows}there is a mixture  
 of old and new houses. Most of the    
 houses are terraced houses, especially
 the old ones. There are quite a few   
 semi-detached houses but hardly any   
 detached. There are some flats above  
 the shopping Precinct. Most of the old
 houses do not have gardens, they have 
 yards.                                
    I live in an old house. It is about
 75 years old. Downstairs there is a   
 hallway, small bathroom, a big dining 
 room, a long kitchen and a front room.
 Upstairs there are three big bedrooms.
 To keep us warm we have two radiators 
 and a gas fire downstairs. Upstairs we
 have three radiators.
