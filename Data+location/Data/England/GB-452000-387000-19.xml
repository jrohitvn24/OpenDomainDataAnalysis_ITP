		<title>19Laughton Area-Unemployment</title>
		<content> This page is contributed anonymously, 
 by an unemployed man, who asked Mr.   
 Gilmore, our class teacher, to put his
 thoughts into words.                  
   I'm a 34 year old craftsman, who    
 has been unemployed for three years. I
 have been trying to obtain work in    
 this area and as far afield as        
 Sheffield, Rotherham and Doncaster    
 during this time, but without success.
 I have also considered moving the     
 family to another part of the country,
 but due to family commitments, this   
 would mean the break up of my family. 
   At the moment unemployment in       
 Dinnington is in excess of 25% and    
 worsening. If the colliery closes,    
 which is likely, it will be over 30%. 
 I desparately want to work, but the   
 place is dying. I would have thought  
 that the least a government could do  
 for its citizens is provide work.     </content>
