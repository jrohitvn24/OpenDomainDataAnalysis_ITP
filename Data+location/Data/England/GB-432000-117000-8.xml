		<title>08BOWMAN'S FARM:TEST VALLEY</title>
		<content>  In contrast to the large Broadlands  
 Farm we studied Bowman's Farm.The     
 owner rents the farm from Broadlands  
 Estate but farms it himself,with his  
 wife and a casual worker.             
  It is 70 acres,and the fields are    
 quite small,varying between 2 and 10  
 hectares and separated by hedgerows   
 which are rich in wildlife.Most of the
 land is flat,but even though it is on 
 the banks of the river,it is not      
 marshy.Most of the soil is clay,with a
 little gravel.It requires potash      
 fertilizers.                          
  It is a mixed farm.Cereals,such as   
 wheat,grass for hay and silage,and    
 market gardening crops are grown.The  
 crops are used to feed the beef cattle
 reared on the farm.These are Friesians
 crossed with Herefords.Hens are kept  
 on the farm too.
