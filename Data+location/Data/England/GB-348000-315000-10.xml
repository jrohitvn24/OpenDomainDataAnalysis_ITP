		<content>   I usually get up in the morning at  
 twenty minutes to eight, but during   
 the past few days I have been getting 
 up at seven or at half past six       
 beacuse of the row that the birds make
 outside my window. I shere my room    
 with Julie who is my twin sister she  
 is a minute older than me and she has 
 the annoying habit of copying         
 everything that Ido,for example if    
 I go unstairs to read or to listen to 
 records she will follow and want to do
 the same.                             
     I also have another sister who is 
 called Debbie she is fifteen months   
 older than us and she sometimes bosses
 us about.                             
     My Mum is a widow and she has to  
 look after us on her own. We are a    
 happy family and enjoy being together 
 and sharing a joke.
