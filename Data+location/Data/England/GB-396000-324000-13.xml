		<title>13  TRANSPORT:CANALS</title>
		<content>  In a mainly rural area a main feature
is the transport links which run in a  
North-West/South-Easterly direction.   
These links;road(A51),railway,and the  
Trent and Mersey Canal run almost      
parallel to the River Trent.           
  The canal provides local employment, 
with the situation of Hoo-Mill Boat    
Yard;here narrow boats are made.The    
yard sells diesel and gas and provides 
mooring space.The canal is nowadays    
used mainly for recreation.A boating   
holiday is a popular pastime.The Isaac 
Walton Club fishes one stretch of the  
canal.The other stretch is owned by    
British Rail.The canal is also part of 
local history with its origins dating  
to the Industrial Revolution.          
  Then it was used to transport coal   
and pottery.
