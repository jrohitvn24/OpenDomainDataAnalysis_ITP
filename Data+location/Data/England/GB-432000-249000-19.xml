		<content>   In 1968{Brigadier Peter Young}wrote 
 a book about the battle of Edge Hill. 
 This was published and printed by the 
{Roundwood Press,}then owned by Gordon 
 Norwood.                              
   To launch the book "Edge Hill 1642" 
 an exhibition was held at the Tower   
 public house, Edge Hill, on the battle
 anniversary 23rd October. David Fisher
 and Gerard Lewis, both of Kineton,had 
 assisted the Brigadier doing local    
 research for his book and were put in 
 charge of mounting the exhibition     
 which was a great success. After      
 discussion with Brigadier Young it was
 decided that his next book "Marston   
 Moor 1644" should be launched with a  
 group of people in seventeenth century
 military uniform. Stage by stage ideas
 were formulated  to do this on a      
 bigger and bigger scale.
