		<title>07VISITING THE FAIR</title>
		<content> Half an hour later it was time for    
 dinner.I had fish and chips and ice   
 cream.Then my mum went up to the      
 summer fair. Half an hour later my    
 sister said to me"Are you going to the
 summer fair."I said I was so we both  
 went to the fair.When we got there we 
 had to wait for five minutes to go in.
 When I was inside I amiediatly went   
 to look at the disco bouncy.After     
 about five minutes we could go inside.
 It was brilliant I dived about every  
 where. When I came out I walked       
 about.I went to my mums store.She was 
 on the book store and I had a few goes
 on some games and then I went home.   
 When I got home I watched Grandstand. 
 After it had finished I went train    
 spotting.We saw a few trains but then 
 we left west leak station.When I got  
 home I had a sandwich and went to bed.
