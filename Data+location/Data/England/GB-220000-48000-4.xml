		<content>      The architecture of Polperro is  
 predominately old-some 300 years at   
 least. Most of it has been modified or
 altered to bring it up to a reasonable
 modern standard,although the basic    
 shapes and fabrics remain unchanged.  
 Many properties have been converted to
 shop,cafes and restaraunts to cater   
 for the tourists. Some of the walls   
 are 0.7 metres thick but without      
 damproofing the houses are not the    
 most comfortable. Many of the         
 Harbourside and streamside properties 
 are 3 storey's high, the lower one    
 originally being used for net storage 
 etc. The still get flooded during     
 'spring' tides even though most are   
 now lived in.Polperro's popularity    
 with tourists has caused the cost of  
 even a small 'fishermans' cottage to  
 rise beyond the means of most local   
 families.                             </content>
