		<content> Southbourne is the largest village in 
 West Sussex,with about 6,000          
 population.The A27 road runs through  
 Southbourne taking most of the traffic
 (and the accidents) away from the     
 country lanes,although this is due be 
 replaced by a new motorway passing to 
 the north of Southbourne.             
    Southbourne is a dormitory village 
 because not many people work there.   
 There are many different houses,      
 including large detatched houses,farm 
 houses and council houses.{           
    Southbourne grew out of Prinsted   
 in the begining of the19th century.The
 main occupation is arable farming.    
    Hambrook is a small village and is 
 very hilly.There is realy only one    
 shop,the Post Office.                 
    Woodmancote is to the east of      
 Hambrook and is the same size.There is
 one pub called The Woodmancote Arms.  </content>
