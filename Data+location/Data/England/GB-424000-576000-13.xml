		<content>    Although Cramlington has large     
 housing estates, there are adventure  
 play parks, football fields, tennis   
 courts, bowling greens, an athletics  
 track, a BMX(bicycle moto-cross)      
 track and an all weather pitch.       
   There are farms on the outskirts of 
 the town which are a mixture of arable
 and pasture. Cramlington also has a   
 Garden Centre which has proved to be a
 very popular addition to the town.    
    A large number of trees have been  
 planted over the years and they are   
 now starting to mature. On each       
 housing estate trees and shrubs have  
 been planted as a contrast to the     
 building area.                        
  Arcot Hall Golf Club covers a large  
 area with grassland, a pond, shrubs,  
 and woodland. There are many pleasant 
 walks through fields and parks.
