		<content>   There is much talk about{terrorism  
 and its effects on people not directly
 involved in conflicts.                
   The{American hostages}have been     
 kept in Beirut,and the Irish          
 Republicans have threatened to plant  
{bombs}at English sea side hotels.It is
 all much discussed but we feel remote 
 from it here.                         
   Nationally there is much concern    
 over{unemployment,}especially of the  
 young, and over the{economy}and the   
 stringencies imposed which cause      
 cutailment of services to the public. 
 We want ecomonies made, but often only
 where it does not adversly affect     
 ourselves.                            
   The very cold and wet{weather}has   
 made life difficult for growers.      
   Teachers countrywide are in dispute 
 over pay, some{schools closing}for 3  
 days.                                 </content>
