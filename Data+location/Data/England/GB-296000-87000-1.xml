		<title>01THE TOPSHAM AREA</title>
		<content> This area includes the town of Topsham
 and the villages of Clyst St. George  
 and Ebford, which lie to the south    
 east of Exeter and are surrounded by  
 farmland. Topsham is a small, quiet   
 town which has the River Exe estuary  
 running through it. It was once a     
 thriving port but now the river is    
 used mainly for pleasure craft and    
 fishing. The area is served by a small
 railway, the Exeter to Exmouth branch 
 line, which links in Exeter with main 
 line services to London and Penzance. 
 There is easy access to the M5        
 motorway which brings many tourists to
 this attractive area. There is a      
 strong community spirit in Topsham and
 its many clubs and societies help     
 to keep alive traditions and          
 activities which give the place its   
 character.
