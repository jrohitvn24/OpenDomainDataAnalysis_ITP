		<title>10THE GASCOIGNE ESTATE</title>
		<content> This housing estate was named after a 
 local family who owned land here. It  
 is a large housing development built  
 in the 1960s to replace poor housing. 
 Most of the buildings are 3-storeys,  
 but there are three 17-storey tower   
 blocks and five 12-storey blocks. St. 
 Ann's has 228 flats. Garage blocks    
 were built but they are being taken   
 down now because of vandals and       
 glue-sniffers. Cars are parked in the 
 streets or on the grass. There is a   
 primary school on the estate and a    
 shopping centre with eight shops, plus
 a concrete playground and a tiny grass
 playing space. There is a day centre  
 for old people nearby and a pub called
 'The Hope'.
