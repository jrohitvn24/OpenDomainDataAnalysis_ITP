		<content> This area was once sea and swamp land 
 and most of the land is sand stone.   
 It is very flat and is covered in clay
 because there was sea.  It is very    
 flat  and is on the Lancashire plain. 
 elling hill is made of sandstone.     
 Mr. Morrey owns Giddygate Farm.  He   
 farms l74 acres.  Most of the land is 
 used for grass.  He frows cabbage,    
 sprouts, potatoes, wheat and barley.  
 He sells his ptatoes bulk to East     
 Riding Farm Produce Ltd.  Mr. Morrey  
 told us that 72 farmers get together  
 and all the potatoes that are picked  
 are sent to one co-operative and are  
 sorted out by a big machine.  If you  
 are on your own you wouldn't be able  
 to afford a machine.   When they get  
 together it is called a co-operative. 
       The co-operatives sell to the   
 big Supermarkets.
