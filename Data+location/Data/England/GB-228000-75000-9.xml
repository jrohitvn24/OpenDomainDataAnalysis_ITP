		<title>09Traffic survey the results</title>
		<content> The road that passes outside the      
 school is the B3257 which connects the
 A30 at Plusha with the A388 at Taylor 
 Shop.It crosses the B3254 at Condons  
 Shop.Apart from a kilometre length of 
 the B3254 which crosses the most NW   
 square of the grid it is the main road
 in the grid.                          
 The survey was completed by 6 groups  
 of 4 children to a group working on   
 different time slices during the day. 
 Two  counting the Eastward flow and   
 two the Westward.                     
 We found no significant difference in 
 the direction of flow.The traffic in  
 the morning was much heavier in the   
 morning even allowing for the shorter 
 afternoon session.We thought this was 
 because in the morning more people    
 would be on their way somewhere and we
 would have gone home before their     
 return in the evening.                </content>
