		<title>13DAWLINGS FARM</title>
		<content>   Dawlings farm is a fruit farm, the  
 land around it is flat and of medium  
 loam, the farm is 46 acres. Most of   
 the work on the farm is done by hand, 
 there are only two tractors, a large  
 and a small tractor. The farmer       
 employs a larger number of labourers  
 in the summer than in the winter.     
 There is no method of crop rotation,  
 once the plants are planted they      
 remain in. Spraying is done at the end
 of spring and again before the crops  
 are picked, this is done by the small 
 tractor. Work is from 5 am till dark. 
   The farm used to be under contract, 
 and although this gave no problems,   
 he prefers free lance or Pick Your    
 Own.  He grows strawberries,          
 raspberries,gooseberries,red and      
 blackcurrents,and loganberries.       
 He also grows some barley.
