		<content> MY FAMILY AS A WHOLE USUALLY SPENDS   
 A FAIR AMOUNT OF ITS                  
 SPARE TIME GOING ON WALKS.   WHEN WE  
 WALK MY SISTER IS ALWAYS PICKING      
 FLOWERS AND TRYING TO CLIMB TREES.    
 MY DAD AND MY MUM LOOK FOR BIRDS, I   
 WALK ALONG PLAYING WITH OUR DOG.      
 WHEN WE GET HOME MY SISTER ASKS MY MUM
 TO PUT THE PLANTS IN WATER.           
 MY SISTER LIKES SINGING TO SONGS ON   
 TELEVISION, NOT THE WORDS, JUST       
 'LA-LA' AND SWINGS HER ARMS ROUND     
 VIOLENTLY.   SHE LIKES PICKING THE    
 BUDS OF MUM'S PLANTS AND KNOCKING THE 
 STUFFING OUT OF HER TOY TEDDY BEAR.   
 MY MUM'S HOBBIES ARE READING ROMANCE  
 STORIES AND KNITTING MULTI-COLOURED   
 CLOTHES.   DAD LIKES GARDENING AND    
 PLAYING ON THE COMPUTER AND I LIKE    
 TRAIN SPOTTING AND PLAYING FOOTBALL.
