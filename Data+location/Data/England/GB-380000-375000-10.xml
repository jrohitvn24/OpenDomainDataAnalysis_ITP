		<content>    We gathered these facts about local
 development from two men, one working 
 for a local estate agent and the other
 with a general knowledge of the area. 
    Many people are moving into the    
 area from the Manchester suburbs as   
 their offices are moving out of the   
 city centre and they have not got as  
 far to travel.                        
    Properties have increased greatly  
 in value. It is old rather than new   
 properties which are on the market.   
 Chelford is an expensive area to buy  
 property.                             
    The Seddon Estate is being extended
 at the moment near Peck Mill Farm.    
    There are two drawbacks to further 
 expansion _ this is a Green-Belt area 
 and no high buildings are allowed near
 Jodrell Bank.
