		<title>08OTLEY _THE CHANGING TIMES</title>
		<content> Before the first World War, just the  
 town centre had been built. The       
 surrounding land was mainly fields. At
 the end of the last century, the main 
 jobs in Otley were in printing.       
 Printers and engineering companies    
 were Waite and Saville, and Bremners. 
   Other jobs were in Ackroyds Mills,  
 weaving cloth. Child labour was no    
 longer existent, and the three R's    
 were taught in Primary schools. Some  
 mills had their own schools to teach  
 part-timers. Walking on the Chevin was
 popular, as was music and singing. At 
 Christmas families went to the        
 Pantomime at Leeds. With World War ll 
 came rationing and food was scarce.   
 Animal victims were cut up for food.  
 Housing was mainly Victorian terracing
 with out-door toilets. There were     
 often only two bedrooms with coal     
 fires in every room.                  </content>
