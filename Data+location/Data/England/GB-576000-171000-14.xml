		<title>14Customs In Hoo.</title>
		<content> Around Hoo there are many customs and 
 different superstitions about the     
 supernatural and the village. The main
 customs and festivals are the main    
 Christian ones,e.g.Christmas, Whitsun 
 and Easter.{Rogation}is a custom in   
 danger of disappearing.This concerns  
 the thanksgiving for the crops and    
 exports and imports of the Parish,and 
 involves a procession round the       
 boundaries of the village.Many customs
 however are now extinct such as The   
 Maypole Dancing on the recreation     
 grounds and many of the differant     
 fetes.There was once a centenary in   
 memory of{Thomas Aveling}who is buried
 in the churchyard.This will most      
 probably never occur again during the 
 next decade.
