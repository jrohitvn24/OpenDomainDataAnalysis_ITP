		<content> school and a school house should be   
 built in the village of Stanwell, and 
 free instruction to those children who
 came to be educated.                  
 The school opened in 1624, in the     
 reign of James I.                     
                                       
 A few days before the closing ceremony
 a local group of people called    {   
{'The Rats'}wrecked the classrooms,so  
 the ceremony had to be put off for a  
 while. The school finally closed on   
 the 30th of July 1954.                
                                       
 The school was transferred to the     
 County Council in 1938 and the money  
 that had previously financed the      
 school was put into a trust fund that 
 is still administered to the present  
 day for the children of Stanwell.
