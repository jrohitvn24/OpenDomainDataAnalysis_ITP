		<title>02   St.Cleer Church.</title>
		<content>    The granite Church of St.Clarus has
 3 aisles ,and was built in 1200 A.D.  
 In 1300 the Church was made bigger and
 the old Norman door was put in the    
 north wall. There  are four stained   
 glass  windows on either side.        
    Inside, the chancel roof has carved
 angels playing musical instruments.   
 There is a photo of the Turin Shroud  
 showing Jesus' face, and his eyes seem
 to move. Behind the organ there is the
 tomb of the Langeford family of 1614. 
 If anybody could say the Creed on it  
 by heart they would get 8d worth of   
 bread every week. The stocks  cost    
 10/6 in 1744. Around  the  walls are  
 painted texts from 1660, and the royal
 coat of arms of Queen Anne. At the    
 back of the church there is a board   
 with the names of all vicars since the
 church was built. A new board has been
 given recently by the Honicombe family</content>
