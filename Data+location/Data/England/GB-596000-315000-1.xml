		<content> The block consists mainly of gently   
 undulating arable farmland and        
 includes the parishes of Beetley (not 
 Old Beetley), Gressenhall and Hoe.    
 Residential development is largely    
 confined to the built up areas of New 
 Beetley and Gressenhall.The children  
 within the block attend St Mary's     
 County Primary School.                
 Most of the farmland is devoted to    
 cereal crops, but there is a large    
 fruit farm at Gorgate Hall.           
 The Norfolk Rural Life Museum is      
 situated at Beech House, Gressenhall. 
 It shares the building with the       
 Norfolk Archeological Unit.           
 A tributary of the River Wensum runs  
 to the south of Beetley and           
 Gressenhall.                          
 There is a small deciduous wood to the
 North of St Mary's School.
