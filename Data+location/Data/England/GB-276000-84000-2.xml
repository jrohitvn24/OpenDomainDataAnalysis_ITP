    Geologically and Geographically    
 this area is one with Dartmoor itself.
 The rocks are precisely similar in    
 character.                            
    The summit of Hingston Down is     
 crowned with granite masses known as  
 Hingston Rocks and has an elevation of
 1000ft.The footpath to this rock is   
 overgrown and difficult to follow.    
    Rather more than one mile to the   
 East rises Blackingstone Rock which is
 considerably over 1000ft and is the   
 finest example of a dome_shaped       
 tor.This rock lies near the road and  
 is easily accessible.It can quite     
 easily be climbed with the help of    
 steps cut into the rock,and handrails.
 The view from the top makes the       
 climb well worth_while.
