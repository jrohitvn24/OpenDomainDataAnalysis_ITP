		<content> In 1910 Arborfield was a small village
 with one main road running through    
 it.At one end of the village stood    
 Newlands farm,a pond and pond cottages
 the pond has been drained but the farm
 and cottages are still there. Several 
 other roads met at this point making  
 it an inportant junction,known as     
 Arborfield Cross.  At the cross was a 
 public house called 'the bull'.       
 On the corner of the school road lived
 Jim Taylor,the tailor, whoes daughters
 worked at Arborfield,Newlands and     
 opossite was a builders yard owned by 
 the Garrett brothers.  The yard is no 
 longer there. Further up the road was 
 an old post office,a black smith and  
 the other,older village pub called    
 'The Swan'.
