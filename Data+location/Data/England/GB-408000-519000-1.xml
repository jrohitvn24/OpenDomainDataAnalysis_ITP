		<title>01West of Staindrop</title>
		<content> The area west of Staindrop village has
 a prominantly rural flavour. Farming  
 in the form of grazing forestry and a 
 little mixed farming contribute       
 greatly to the areas economy. Off the 
 Z roads transecting the area to       
 Egglestone and Barnard Castle the     
 latter is of most importance as       
 Barnard Castle itself acts as the     
 economic nucleus of the whole area    
 known as 'Teesdale' behaving as a kind
 of Entrepot, being of greatest        
 importance to the farming community.  
 The colour and beauty of this areas   
 undulating landscape broken by the    
 occasional set of white farm          
 buildings, which belong to the famous 
 Lord Barnard's  Raby Estate is often  
 forgotten in a region of outstanding  
 beauty.
