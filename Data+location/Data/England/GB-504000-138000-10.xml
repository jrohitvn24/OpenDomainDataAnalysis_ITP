		<title>10SWALLOW TILES</title>
		<content>   Tiles and bricks have been made in  
 the Cranleigh area since Roman times. 
 Swallow's Tiles was started in 1855   
 by the grandfather of the two present 
 directors.The materials come from     
 their own clay pit.                   
   First they put the sode on the bench
 and cut it up with a wire,then the    
 clay is put in the mould which makes  
 the tile shape.You smooth the tile    
 with a strike,turn the tile out onto a
 board and when you have twenty tiles  
 on the board you put them in a line to
 dry.Then you put them in a checker.   
   The tiles go over all of England.   
 Every week 2000 tiles are made.They   
 are sand face tiles, ridge, hip,      
 valleys, angles, hanging tiles,       
 gables, and eves.                     
   There are 28 people working there   
 now.
