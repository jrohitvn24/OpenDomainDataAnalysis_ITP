		<title>14LIFE IN ST COLUMB MINOR</title>
		<content> Mr Roberts is the owner of Treviglas  
 Farm.The equipment used includes      
 tractors,ploughs and other machines.  
 His great uncle farmed here before    
 him.The animals on the farm are dogs  
 (to mind sheep),cats (to keep down    
 vermin) cows and hens.Most of the land
 is grass which grows well in Cornwalls
 moist climate.                        
 Another farm called Penrose Farm is   
 "Duchy property" meaning it belongs to
 the Duke of Cornwall or more usually  
 known as the "Prince of Wales". In the
 future this farm may well be          
 refurbished.Who-ever runs the house   
 will be very lucky because it has a   
 beautiful view down the Porth River   
 and you can see one of the Newquay's  
 7 tourist beaches,called "Porth Beach"
 St.Columb Minor church is made of     
 granite.The tower had fallen into     
 disrepair and is now being rebuilt.   </content>
