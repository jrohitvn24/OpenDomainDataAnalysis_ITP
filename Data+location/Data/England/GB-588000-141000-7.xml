		<title>07Smarden - Local History</title>
		<content> Smarden developed from a clearing in  
 the Forest of Anderida and records    
 show it was a parish in 1205, when    
 Adam de Essex was rector. A copy of   
 the charter of Elizabeth I endorsing  
 that granted by Edward III in 1332    
 conferring the right to have a weekly 
 market and an annual fair, hangs in   
 the church. The Minnis which means    
 'land owned by the public' is the     
 village playing field. A roofed pump  
 in The Street commemorates the diamond
 jubilee of Queen Victoria in 1897. The
 entrance from The Street to the       
 churchyard is under the Penthouse, the
 medieval term for an overhanging      
 outhouse. Refugees from Europe,       
 fleeing persecution, founded the cloth
 and wool trade upon which the         
 village's prosperity was based. Linen 
 was still being woven at Dragon House 
 less than 100 years ago.              </content>
