		<title>01MENDIP PLATEAU ABOVE CHEDDAR</title>
		<content> The top of Mendip Hills is a bleak,   
 undulating plain, divided up into     
 small/medium sized fields bounded     
 mostly by ancient dry-stone walls. The
 surface of many fields presents a very
 rough appearance where old quarry     
 workings have become grassed over.    
 There are some trees - a plantation   
 of Scotts Pines exists and Copper     
 Beech line some roads (plantd on top  
 of the dry-stone walls). Self         
 regenerated Hawthorn trees dot        
 the countryside and are very stunted. 
 Many  reflect the windy, exposed      
 nature of the habitat by their        
 lopsided growth. Houses are either old
 and attached to farms or modern       
 bungalows. The roads are generally    
 straight, but narrow. Part of the land
 is used as a rifle range, the         
 remaining land is used for animal     
 husbandry (mostly dairy cattle.)      </content>
