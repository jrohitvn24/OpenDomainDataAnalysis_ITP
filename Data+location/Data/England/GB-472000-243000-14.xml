 themselves with outdoor games. Hoops  
 were popular, wooden ones for the     
 girls,metal ones for the boys.        
 Spinning tops and skipping ropes were 
 great favourites.                     
   At the turn of the century,the      
 village itself had no electrcity,     
 gas, or main drainage. Lighting was by
 candle or oillamps and cooking was    
 done over the fire. On Sundays people 
 would take their dinner to the bakers 
 shop and have him put it in the oven  
 to cook. This cost them half an old   
 penny. Milk was purchased from the    
 farm in the High Street,which is now  
 the shop,and bread and meat would be  
 delivered by cart or bicycle.         
   The average wage of the farm worker 
 was very low and many families had a  
 great struggle to afford shoes.
