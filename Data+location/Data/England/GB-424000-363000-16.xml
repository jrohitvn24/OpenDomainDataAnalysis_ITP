		<content> Our cook came to this school. School  
 was very different then. If children  
 were naughty they'd get the cane. If  
 they couldn't answer a question ,     
 they'd wear a dunce's cap. The infants
 wrote on slates using a scratchy      
 stylus. Older children had steel      
 nibbed pens which spluttered. Now we  
 have books, pencils,  biros, felt tips
 and roller pens. The infant classroom 
 had an open fire. There was also a    
 smokey stove. Now we have oil fired   
 central heating. There were parafin   
 lamps. We have modern neon strip      
 lighting. The toilets were outside    
 earth closets. Ours are inside        
 flushing toilets and urinals. Some    
 children walked 3 miles to school.    
 They brought jam sandwiches and drank 
 water from the village tap. We come by
 bus or taxi and have good school      
 dinners cooked in the school kitchen. </content>
