		<title>10  THE WOOLPACK PUBLIC HOUSE</title>
		<content>  In a rural area, leisure activities  
and places for the community to meet   
are restricted. One important building 
therefore is the Public House. This one
situated in the village of Weston.     
  These houses serve alcholic drinks   
to  people aged 18 and over. Such      
drinks include beers (mild and         
bitter); wines; spirits (whisky;rum)   
and soft drinks (fruit juices,lemonade)
  However,in recent times,the          
nature of these places has had to      
change as increased taxation of        
alcholic drinks and harsher penalties  
for drinking and driving offences have 
induced a decline in their popularity. 
 Meeting this challange the Woolpack   
now lays on lunch and evening meals    
which range from sandwiches to sausage 
and chips or Scampi and chips.There is 
also a beer garden.                    
                                       </content>
