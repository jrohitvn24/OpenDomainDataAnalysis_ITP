		<title>19TOURISM: NATEBY &amp; WHARTON</title>
		<content> LYING BETWEEN THE YORKSHIRE DALES     
 AND THE LAKE DISTRICT, THE TOURIST    
 INDUSTRY IN THIS AREA HAS NOT DEVEL-  
 OPED GREATLY. THIS IS A DISTRICT OF   
 GREAT NATURAL BEAUTY AND LESS SPOILT  
 BY MAN THAN MOST OTHER PARTS OF       
 ENGLAND.GENUINE COUNTRY LOVERS ENJOY  
 FELL WALKING AND THE COAST TO COAST   
 WALK CROSSES THE AREA.THE NUMEROUS    
 FOOTPATHS ARE WELL USED. NO-ONE IN    
 THIS DISTRICT DEPENDS ON TOURISTS FOR 
 THEIR INCCOME.THE BLACK BULL INN AT   
 NATEBY IS THE ONLY EATING PLACE AND   
 3 PRIVATE HOUSES OFFER BED &amp; BREAK-   
 FAST ACCOMMODATION.THERE ARE NO OFF-  
 ICIAL CARAVAN SITES AND NONE OF THE   
 FARMS HAVE ANY INCOME FROM TOURISM.   
 SUMMER TRAFFIC ON THE ROADS FROM THE  
 DALES WHICH CONVERGE ON NATEBY IS     
 HEAVY BUT MOST PASS THROUGH WITHOUT   
 STOPPING FOR ANY LENGTH OF TIME.
