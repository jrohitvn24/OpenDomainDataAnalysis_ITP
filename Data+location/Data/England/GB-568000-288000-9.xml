		<title>09GRANGE FARM, HOCKWOLD</title>
		<content>   Grange Farm is on the side of a low 
 hill. It is quite a small farm, about 
 a hundred and sixteen hectares. We are
 near a man made river but the soil is 
 chalky and dry.                       
   We employ one person but we've      
 increased the time necessary for      
 casual workers because of the crops we
 grow. These are winter wheat, winter  
 barley, spring barley, grass,(for     
 seed) onions, sugar beet, rough grass 
 for cows and gherkins.                
   While we have been here we have made
 changes to the buildings and put up   
 new ones. We've changed the storage   
 and joined a co-operative onion group.
 We sell them with other people to get 
 a better price and sell them to the   
 supermarket. The most significant     
 change is the payments with the E.E.C.
 from Europe. The quotas imposed on    
 milk might happen to other things.    </content>
