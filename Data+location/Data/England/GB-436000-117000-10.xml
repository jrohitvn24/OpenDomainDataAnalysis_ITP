		<title>10FARMING 3</title>
		<content>   Kiln farm has about forty ponies and
 horses and a donkey. Wendy Bland runs 
 the stables and also does the lessons.
 There are three lessons. There is the 
 5.00 pm lesson , 6.45 pm lesson and a 
 7.00 pm lesson . The 7.00 pm lesson is
 for experienced riders.The other two  
 lessons are for juniors. Wendy has    
 about 20 stable girls and a man called
 Derek who helps her run the stables.  
 She does lesson on the first three    
 days of each week . Kiln farm is by   
 Toot Hill in Rownhams Lane.           
   We have a bee farm in our block and 
 Mrs Fielder owns it.It isn't really a 
 farm because it only has five bee     
 hives and Mrs Fielder keeps the       
 honey .Bees have six legs and black   
 stripes. I am talking about the furry 
 Bumblebee which is probably the most  
 common bee.A hive holds 60000 bees and
 produces 400 pounds of honey.         </content>
