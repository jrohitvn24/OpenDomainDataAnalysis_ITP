		<content>    South Wight Planning Committee have
 granted approval for the construction 
 of a toilet block at the rear of the  
 Hideaway Cafe on the  cliff path at   
 Shanklin.                             
    Alcoholic poisoning caused the     
 death of a 63 year old Shanklin man   
 who drank methylated spirits and      
 surgical spirit.                      
    Two 15_year_old Shanklin youths    
 accused of a Â£2,200 arson attack at   
 Shanklin beach huts have been remanded
 for seven days in the care of the     
 local authority.                      
    Sandown Baptist Church was filled  
 almost to capacity on Saturday to     
 welcome the new minister, the Rev.    
 John Crew, at his induction service.  
   Holidaymakers were among the many   
 visitors at St.Saviour's Church,      
 Shanklin, during the harvest and      
 flower festival.                      </content>
