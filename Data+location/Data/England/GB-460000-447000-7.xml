		<content> Main Street has seen better times.    
 Though it has the few shops that are  
 in the area its main function is that 
 of a routeway between York and the    
 A64, and most of the traffic is       
 through traffic                       
 The shops themselves seem to be rather
 unusual perhaps trying to attract as  
 many customers as they can, rather    
 than simply catering for village      
 trade.                                
 There is a{newsagency,}a{butcher's,}a}
{chemist's,}a{bakery,}a{dairy}and a    
{fish and chip shop}but also a{frozen  
{food centre,}a{book shop,}a           
{bric-a-brac shop,}a{D.I.Y. shop,}a    
{florist's,}a{hairdresser's,}a         
{costumier's,}a{kitchen design centre, 
 three{building societies,}three{pubs, 
 a{garage}and of course a{post office. 
 Finally there is one small, but       
 attractive{guest house.}              </content>
