		<content>THE FIRST FESTIVAL OF THE YEAR IS THE  
PANTOMIME.LAST YEAR IT WAS "ALI BABA   
AND THE FORTY THIEVES".THESE PANTOMIMES
ARE USUALLY INTENDED TO ENTERTAIN      
CHILDREN ALTHOUGH THEY ARE ENJOYED BY  
ADULTS TOO.THE MAY FESTIVAL IS HELD    
AROUND THE END OF MAY,ALTHOUGH IT IS   
OFTEN POSTPONED DUE TO BAD WEATHER.    
THE ATRACTIONS INCLUDE COUNTRY DANCING,
STALLS AND GAMES.AT THE END OF JUNE,WE 
HAVE THE VILLAGE FETE.THIS IS A BIG    
OCCASION AND OVER 500 PEOPLE FROM      
ALL AROUND BYFIELD COME TO WATCH       
EXHIBITIONS AND HAVE GOES ON RIDES

BIG GAP WHEN NO FETES OR FESTIVALS ARE 
HELD.
