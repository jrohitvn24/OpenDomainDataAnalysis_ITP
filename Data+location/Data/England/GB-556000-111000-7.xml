		<title>07Memories of the War.</title>
		<content> I interviewed a local family and      
 they told me that after the war they  
 were rationing food and clothes, and  
 when you went out you still had to    
 keep an eye out for bombs that hadn't 
 gone off.You could buy army blankets  
 very cheaply so you could make winter 
 coats out of them.They still had cars,
 but open roofed ones with starting    
 handles, and they weren't very        
 comfortable and they were slow.{      
{MEALS; Breakfast=porridge,Dinner=Wild 
{rabbit or sausage meat,with home-grown
{vegetables.Desert=rice pudding.       
{Tea=home-made jam, dripping cake,     
{home-made butter and bread. You had to
{milk your own cow in the morning and  
{at night.}On Market day you had to    
 drive your animals along the road.    
 Home-guard:They did a drill once a    
 week and stood on guard all night.
