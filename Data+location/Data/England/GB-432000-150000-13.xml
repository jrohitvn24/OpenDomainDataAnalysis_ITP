		<content> On Mr Cherrington's farm there are    
 1200 breeding ewes, 27 rams and       
 1800 lambs are born each year.The     
 type of sheep Mr Cherrington breeds is
 called Mules.The sheep are dipped     
 twice a year for protection against   
 scab. They shear the ewes once a year 
 in the spring then they pack the wool 
 and send it off to the depot          
 where it is auctioned  and sent       
 all over the world to make            
 carpets.From December to April        
 they feed the sheep hay.Just before   
 they have lambs he feeds them cake    
 which is a mixture of corn and protein
 and helps the sheep to produce milk to
 feed the lambs .He spends $100 per day
 on animal food.The land is not very   
 good land in Tangley. Mr Cherrington  
 has got 900 acres and of these 600    
 acres are given to crops.
