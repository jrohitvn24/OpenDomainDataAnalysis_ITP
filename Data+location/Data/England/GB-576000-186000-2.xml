		<title>02Landscape of South Benfleet.</title>
		<content> Sth Benfleet developed around the     
 creek on rising ground above the      
 marshes which are now drained and used
 as playing fields.Modern houses cover 
 much of the surrounding hills,whose   
 steep wooden slopes cut it off from   
 the uplands of Thundersley and        
 Hadleigh and made it dependent on     
 river transport.The first settlers    
 arrived by boat; the Saxon name       
 Beomflet means a wooded waterway.     
 Vikings anchored their ships in the   
 Creek before King Alfred's troops     
 ousted them in 896 AD.A thriving port 
 was maintained in the Middle Ages and 
 now the Yacht Club continues the river
 connection.The railway line,too,runs  
 along the Creek and salt air greets   
 passengers alighting at the station.  
 Hadleigh Country Park stretches across
 Benfleet Downs and 3 working farms add
 to the semi_rural aspect.             </content>
