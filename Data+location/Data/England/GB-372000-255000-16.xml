 which belonged to ex_servicemen.As the
 village grew,this became too small.It 
 was also old and unsafe for large     
 gatherings so it was decided that a   
{new hall}should be built which would  
 belong to the villagers.A committee   
 was formed and{fund raising events    
 took place.These included an ox_roast,
 dances,fetes,whist drives and

 building began.                       
   The hall was opened in 1954 and was 
 named The Coronation Hall since Queen

 chairs,tables,crockery and cutlery and
 is now used by most of the clubs and  </content>
