		<title>05ECOLOGY IN PAXFORD AREA (1)</title>
		<content> Paxford is situated 110m above sea    
 level surrounded by hills between 160m
 and 195m high.It lies in an area of   
 Lias(Lower Jurassic)clay.Soil ph7.5   
 Average annual rainfall>75 cm.        
  Habitats are all semi-natural,       
 i.e.although managed and modified by  
 man contain fairly stable communities 
 of plant and animal life.Roadside     
 verges and hedges provide richest     
 habitats in mainly agricultural area. 
 The extensive area of interconnected  
 and economically unproductive land on 
 roadside verges is the last big nature
 reseve,and is very sensitive to       
 changes in Highway policy.Verges are  
 managed with considerations toward    
 safety,bank stability,drainage and    
 weed control.More abundant plant      
 growth in 1985 has resulted from later
 trimming than usual,providing vital   
 cover for small animals and birds.    </content>
