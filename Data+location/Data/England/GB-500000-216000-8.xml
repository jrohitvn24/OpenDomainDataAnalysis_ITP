		<title>08Police in Kensworth Area</title>
		<content> This area is patrolled 8 hours a day,5
 days a week by a Resident Beat Officer
 on motor cycle.We form just a small   
 part of a much wider area which his   
 beat covers. We are also under the    
 watchful eye of a 24  hour panda car  
 patrol.Neither of these patrols carry 
 fire arms.Our R.B.O. mainatains links 
 with Kensworth and Studham children at
 their village schools and he attends  
 Whipsnade Parish Council meetings.    
 There is generally a low crime rate in
 the area. The chief problems          
 encountered are thefts from           
 cars,particularly from the zoo car    
 parks. Youths riding motor bikes on   
 prohibited land cause some problems.  
 Our R.B.O. would like to see more     
 Neighbourhood Watch Groups established
 as an aid to crime prevention.
