		<title>05THE SOAR NAVIGATION</title>
		<content> The{River Soar}is mainly used by      
 private{cruisers}and{narrowboats.}The 
 fish in the River are{Perch, Pike,    
{Roach}and{Gudgeon.}You see lots of    
 fishermen around the Weir. Narrowboats
 are just as popular as cruisers but   
 narrowboats are made of steel where   
 cruisers are made of glass reinforced 
 fibre. The{Lock}is 12ft deep. It is   
 called{Barrow Deep Lock.}You can see  
{moorhens, coots, dabchicks, ducks}and 
{geese.}The Soar is not near any roads 
 so it is very quiet. There are trees  
 all down the side so you go down a    
 sort of tunnel.{Hired boats}come down 
 the Soar. The nearest hire boat bases 
 are at Shardlow and Sawley, but they  
 are day boats. There is a big step    
 weir in Barrow. People use{dinghies   
 and{canoes}as well. Boats have inboard
 or outboard engines. There are four   
 canal bridges in Barrow.{DAVID ROBERTS</content>
