		<content> Priston (mentioned in the 1086        
 Domesday book) consists of 65 houses, 
 3 farms (Village, Pressbarrow and     
 Church), a sewage works, a church, a  
 garage, the Ring of Bells public house
 and the village hall (a former school)
  1/3 of the houses have either been   
 built during the last 25 years or are 
 converted farm/mine workers cottages. 
 Only one more house can be built but  
 further conversion of present cottages
 or barns can take place.              
  Approximately 240 people live in     
 Priston. 20 are aged between 4 and 16 
 years and 12 are over 60. The oldest  
 is 92.                                
  There is little unemployment. Several
 people are self-employed with only two
 people employed in the village (on a  
 farm). The majority of the inhabitants
 work in nearby towns and cities.
