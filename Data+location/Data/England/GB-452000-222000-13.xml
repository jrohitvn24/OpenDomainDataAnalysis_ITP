		<title>13 AN OUTSIDERS VIEW</title>
		<content>    If you blink on a car journey you  
could be through Middleton Stoney, but 
if you stop and wander off the main    
road you will discover an example of   
what an English village may have been  
like many years ago.Many of the houses 
are centuries old and any new houses   
have had to fit in with the            
environment.                           
    The village is very peaceful and   
quiet and far removed from the bustle  
of city life.                          
    This village would obviously be    
attractive to weekenders or people     
from  the city, because of its peace   
and tranquility and its attractiveness 
to naturalists.There are numerous local
walks available with a wealth of both  
wildlife and birdlife.                 
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
