		<content>   The nursery got its name from John  
 Laveddon, a former mayor of Bodmin. It
 covers 8 acres of land and consists of
 7 greenhouses. Four people work there 
 - two full time - two part time. Mr   
 and Mrs. King who own the nursery also
 work there. The workers range from    
 18-50, years old. The most popular    
 kind of plant is the Fuchsia. The most
 expensive plant is the Weeping Purple 
 Beach; it costs Â£11.00. Eighteen kinds
 of bedding plants are sold at the     
 nursery. All the plants are watered by
 hosepipe. In the summer, the average  
 number of people visiting the nursery 
 in one day is about 75 - in winter    
 about 30. The average number of plants
 sold in a year is 350,000.            
   Near the nursery is a stream which  
 forms part of the parish boundry.
