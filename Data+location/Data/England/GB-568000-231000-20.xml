		<title>20Watching Television.</title>
		<content>   One of the most popular things we do
 out of school in our own time is to   
 watch television.Everybody watches it 
 at some time every day.               
   About half the people in the school 
 watch breakfast television before     
 coming to school.                     
   The most popular programme at the   
 moment is "Dogtanian" a cartoon       
 version of Dumas' "Three Muskateers"  
 starring dogs!                        
   Also popular are the American soap  
 operas with "Dallas" the story of rich
 oil barons from Texas still the most  
 popular,though supposedly made for    
 adult viewing.                        
   Cartoons of almost any sort always  
 feature among the most watched of the 
 progammes and there are some on every 
 day on breakfast television and during
 childrens television at teatime.
