		<title>19ANOTHER DAY</title>
		<content> In the mornings I would get up at     
 7:30.For breakfast I will have        
 cerals.I go to School by car driven by
 Mum.School starts at 9 o'clock.On a   
 holiday morning I will have a big     
 argument with my brother.A day off    
 would mean just sandwiches for        
 lunch.But if we were at School boring 
 old sandwiches,drink and an apple     
 again.You can't sunbathe with Sultan  
 (our cat) because he bites your       
 nose.Boiling eggs is easy.Just wait   
 for the eggs to boil then put the     
 toast down,when it pops the eggs are  
 ready.My Dad will normally come home  
 from 5 o'clock till 8:30.He is a      
 director at a car firm.In the day at  
 home the television is normally an    
 answer,playing or having friends      
 over.When I have friends over my litle
 sister always gets in our way.Mum has 
 to keep the peace.                    </content>
