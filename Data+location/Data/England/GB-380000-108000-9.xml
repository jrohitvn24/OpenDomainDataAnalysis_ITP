		<content> THE VILLAGE SHOP                      
                                       
 There is a village shop in Okeford    
 Fitzpaine. It has a Post Office in it.
 We asked the owners a few questions   
 about it.                             
 They told us that they have about 100 
 customers each day, mainly local      
 people although they do get a few     
 passing customers as well.  Some of   
 the customers do their weekly shopping
 there, but most go there for odds and 
 ends, and do their weekly shopping at 
 one of the large supermarkets in town.
 The Post Office is used a lot by local
 people and helps to keep the          
 customers.                            
                                       
 There are two garages in Okeford,     
 a public house ,"The Royal Oak",and an
 electrical shop.
