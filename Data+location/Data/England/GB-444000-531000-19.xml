		<title>19Elwick C.of E.Primary School</title>
		<content> Elwick school is twenty six years     
 old. It was built closer to the       
 village than the old school, which is 
 over a hundred years old. The old     
 school is now used as a church hall.  
 The new school has only fifty four    
 pupils and three full time teachers.  
 All the teachers live in Elwick. Eight
 years ago it had 105 pupils. Children 
 come to the school from Dalton Piercy,
 Elwick and all the farms in the       
 district. The school has visiting     
 teachers who come to teach violin and 
 cello. There are three classes in the 
 school with pupils in them from the   
 age of four to eleven.                
      The school is in very pleasant   
 surroundings and there is no vandalism
 at all in or around the place. It has 
 a good playing field, but it is not   
 big enough for full size football     
 matches and games.                    </content>
