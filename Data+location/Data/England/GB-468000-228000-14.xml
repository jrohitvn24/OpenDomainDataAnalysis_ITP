		<content> There are differing attitudes to      
 conservation within the village. Some 
 farmers are pulling up hedges, but    
 most are leaving them and many are    
 planting trees.Some farmers are care- 
 less when stubble burning, but the    
 majority take care and follow the     
 rules laid down by their union. There 
 has been local controversy recently   
 when the water authority decided to   
 clean up the river during early       
 summer, thus destroying the nests of  
 some water birds though some were     
 saved by the efforts of a handful of  
 villagers. The now disused railway    
 line which passes through the area is 
 a haven for many species of flora and 
 fauna. Here if you are lucky you may  
 see a fox or a green woodpecker, a    
 rabbit or a tree creeper. If you know 
 where to look you may see wild        
 violets, primroses or cowslips.       </content>
