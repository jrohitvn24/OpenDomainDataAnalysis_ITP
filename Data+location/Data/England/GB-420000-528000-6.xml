		<title>06ST.ANNE'S C.E.PRIMARY SCHOOL</title>
		<content>{ST.ANNE'S}is an old school which used 
 to be in the town centre close to {   
{St.Anne's Church.} It moved to Warwick
 Road on the outskirts of {Bishop      
{Auckland}owing to an increase in      
 housing in that area. It was          
 officially opened in 1972.            
 Our school takes part in many sports  
 activities including swimming,        
 football, netball and athletics. Each 
 year we have a Sports Day in which the
 three house teams Brancepeth, Raby and
 Witton compete against each other.    
 They are named after local castles.   
 My name is Heidi Sutton. I have been  
 in Brownies for 4 months and guides a 
 month.We use St.Anne's School hall for
 Brownies and Guides. Brownies meet at 
 6.00pm and finish at 7.00pm. Sometimes
 we go to the{DAM HEAD}by the river    
 Wear to cook.
