		<title>14ST.JOHNS CADETS SUTTON</title>
		<content>   The cadets are held at Sutton       
 Welfare from 6.30 to 7.30. Anyone     
 between 6 and 17 can join. We usually 
 do first aid, but sometimes we go on  
 treasure trails. The leader is Ruth   
 O'Shea. The highest badge is the      
 Grand Prior. You do not become a      
 proper cadet until you have been      
 enrolled. When you are enrolled you   
 receive a white book and a dress      
 badge. It is now that you can start   
 towards a Grand Priors badge. To reach
 this you have to achieve 12           
 proficiencies.                        
   Every year there is a chance to go  
 to Skegness free, but you have to     
 attend inspection which lasts for     
 about 30 minutes. The officers inspect
 the cadets uniforms to make sure their
 badges are on correctly and their     
 uniforms are smart.
