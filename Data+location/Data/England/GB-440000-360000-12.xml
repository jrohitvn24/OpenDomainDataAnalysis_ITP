		<title>12TIBSHELF MILK ROUND</title>
		<content> My dad works as a milkman. He has got 
 two helpers called Keith and Andy. He 
 gets the milk from Express Dairy. He  
 takes the milk round every day except 
 Christmas Day and Boxing Day.         
 He gets up between 5.00 and 5.30 in   
 the morning. First of all he delivers 
 to the houses in Tibshelf, then he    
 goes to Wingerworth and Tupton. He has
 to make sure that the right milk is   
 taken to the right house.             
 When he has finished he takes the milk
 that is left over back to the dairy   
 and then comes back home. On Fridays  
 he goes round collecting the money and
 then he pays his milk bill. The money 
 left over he keeps.                   
 Sometimes I go round with him and help
 deliver the milk. He gives me Â£3.50 a 
 week.
