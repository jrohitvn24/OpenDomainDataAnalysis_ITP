		<title>06WEASENHAM HALL</title>
		<content> A large house or hall has been on     
 this site since medieval times when   
 the property belonged to John de      
 Weasenham.                            
   The present hall was built at the   
 direction of Lady Leicester in 1905.  
 It is made of red brick in Tudor style
 with "Dutch" end gables on the top.   
 The house was in disrepair when the   
 present owners inherited it in 1957.  
 They had the towers taken down and the
 lead sold which helped pay for the    
 house to be renovated.   It took two  
 years to do the repairs.   The central
 staircase was removed and a smaller   
 one put in.   Some ceilings were      
 lowered and the house made more       
 suitable for a family to live in.     
 The house was saved from being        
 demolished and it is hoped that the   
 owner's family will continue to live  
 there in years to come.               </content>
