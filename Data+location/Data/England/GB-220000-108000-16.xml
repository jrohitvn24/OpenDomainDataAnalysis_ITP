		<title>16A CONVERTED CHURCH AT STIBB</title>
		<content> The small{church}at Stibb was built in
 1882 for the{Church of England.}Cannon
 Thynne, who was vicar of the parish   
 church at Kilkhampton,built it for    
 nuns while they ran an{orphanage.}The 
 nuns departed during World War 1 and  
 parishoners had to attend church at   
 Kilkhampton.In 1975 the church was    
 finally closed.                       
   Rev. Watts, who had conducted the   
 services there from 1958 to 1975,     
 decided to buy it for conversion to a 
 house for his own retirement.The walls
 are made of local quarried stone and  
 are 53 cms. thick. In the church there
 is a large original{stained-glass     
{window}which Rev. Watts has retained. 
 Although it is a home now, it is still
 recognisable as a{chapel}at the       
 cross-roads in the hamlet.
