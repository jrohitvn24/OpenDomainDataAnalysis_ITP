		<content>IT IS PROPOSED TO ADD TO THE PLAYING   
FIELD BY LEVELLING MORE GROUND AND     
BY MAKING FOOTBALL AND CRICKET PITCHES,
AND EXTRA TENNIS COURT AND AN ADVENTURE
PLAYGROUND.IT WOULD COST 30 000 POUNDS.
WE FOUND OUT A FEW PEOPLE DID NOT WANT 
THE PLAYING FIELD TO BE CHANGED BECAUSE
OF NATURE REASONS.ONE PERSON SAID THAT 
30 000 POUNDS WAS TOO MUCH.MANY THOUGHT
THAT THE MONEY COULD GO TO A BETTER    
CAUSE.A LOT OF PEOPLE WANTED THE       
PLAYING FIELD CHANGED BECAUSE OF THE   
FACILTIES THAT WOULD BE MADE.MOST      
PEOPLE USED THE PLAYING FIELD AS IT HAS
A NICE VIEW TO LOOK AT.OTHERS ENJOYED  
IT FOR WALKING AND OTHERS FOR PLAYING  
GAMES, ALTHOUGH ONLY A FEW PEOPLE WERE 
IN THAT CATEGORY.IF IT WAS CHANGED     
ONLY A FEW PEOPLE WOULD USE IT MORE AND
A FEW WOULD USE IT LESS.
