		<title>03DOMESTIC BUILDINGS, N CREAKE</title>
		<content> Most of the dwellings in N Creake are 
 cottage-type, of clunch or chalk, with
 brick quoins, and flint facing.  As   
 there is no building stone in N       
 Norfolk, one does not find the ancient
 houses of the limestone or granite    
 districts of the country.             
 Although the village is not in a      
 conservation area, most of the houses 
 that have been built in recent years, 
 have been faced with flint in the     
 traditional style of the district,    
 with casement windows, and pantiles   
 roofs.                                
 About one third of all village homes  
 are council houses, built of brick.   
 There is one large farmhouse that     
 could be one of the former manor      
 houses.                               
 The very large former Rectory was sold
 by the church authorities, and has    
 been on the market for some time.     </content>
