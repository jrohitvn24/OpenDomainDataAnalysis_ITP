		<content>    The Calcot area is well provided   
 for healthwise.There are doctors      
 surgeries held regularly in all parts 
 of Calcot and Tilehurst.Doctors in    
 this area report that flu is still the
 most common complaint.                
    However,dentist's clinics are      
 nowhere as common as doctor's         
 surgeries and in most cases local     
 people must travel into Reading to    
 find a dentist clinic.                
    There are two large hospitals      
 in Reading-The Royal Berkshire,and the
 Battle.These hospitals provide an     
 excellent service for local people.   
    There are also good visiting       
 facilities in this area.Health        
 visitors visit homes to monitor young 
 children's progress,doctors and nurses
 visit schools to check children's     
 health,and much provision is made for 
 old people,both at home and in homes. </content>
