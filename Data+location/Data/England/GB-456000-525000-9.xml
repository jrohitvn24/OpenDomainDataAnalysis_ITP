		<title>09Redcar as a holiday resort</title>
		<content> 50 years ago Redcar was popular with  
 Yorkshire people for their holidays as
 they could not afford to go far away  
 for a holiday.                        
                                       
 After 1945 Redcar became a dormitory  
 town for industrial Middlesbrough but 
 the people of Redcar wanted a quiet   
 town and didn't want too many holiday 
 makers coming to Redcar.              
 Now people are returning, particularly
 the day-trippers.                     
                                       
 For holiday makers today there is     
 the R.N.L.I.Zetland Lifeboat Museum,  
 miles of sandy beaches, rocks, Redcar 
 Races, a Leisure Centre, an annual    
 Carnival and an annual Folk Festival. 
                                       
 There are two caravan sites and plenty
 of Bed and Breakfast accommodation.
