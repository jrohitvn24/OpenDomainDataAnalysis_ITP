		<title>09PETS AND ANIMALS</title>
		<content>  In the local area most people have   
 pets for company. In a survey I found 
 that the most popular pet was a dog.  
 All in all, my results read; 42 dogs, 
 11 cats, 8 horses,7 birds,7 gerbils,  
 6 hens,2 hamsters,2 goats,2 rabbits,  
 and 1 tortoise.                       
  This shows that if an animal can     
 show affection then the animal is     
 frequently found in homes throughout  
 the area. No-one said they had        
 goldfish. I think this is because     
 goldfish cannot show their affection  
 as well as other animals. I also think
 the reason dogs are so popular is     
 because they are useful as guide dogs,
 guard dogs and a source of company.   
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
