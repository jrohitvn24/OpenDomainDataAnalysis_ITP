		<title>05Farming at Weston</title>
		<content>There is mixed farming in the area,the 
majority of which is arable - mostly   
wheat,whilst fodder crops such as oil  
seed rape,maize and grass for silage   
are also grown to a lesser degree. The 
rest of the farmland is used for the   
grazing of sheep,pigs(an outdoor herd) 
and store cattle.A small amount of     
dairy farming is carried out but this  
is declining in the area.One small     
area of woodland has been planted with 
conifers as a cash crop.The rest of the
woodland is managed for sporting       
purposes.
