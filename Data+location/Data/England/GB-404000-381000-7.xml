		<title>07The Crown and Mitre</title>
		<content> The Crown and Mitre is a friendly pub.
 It is not very large and is situated  
 in New Smithy. It is the sort of place
 you can take your family to and you   
 can meet your friends, or you can go  
 there for some peace and quiet by     
 yourself.                             
 The atmosphere of the Crown and Mitre 
 is very friendly and jolly. It sort of
 reflects Chinley village, because     
 everybody seems to know each other and
 get on well.                          
 The front and the back of the building
 are completely different, because at  
 the front there is the busyness of    
 Hayfield Road and at the back there is
 the quietness and calmness of the     
 hamlet of New Smithy.                 
 The Crown and Mitre is run by Mr and  
 Mrs Hall, who have been the landlord  
 and landlady for some years now.
