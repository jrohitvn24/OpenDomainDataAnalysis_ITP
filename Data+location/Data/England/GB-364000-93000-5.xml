		<content> Stratton 1985 -agrarian village farmed
 by one family.  Has a small public    
 house, no Post Office, no shop, no    
 railway halt, no school.  Junior      
 children are taken by bus to and from 
 Charminster; seniors to Dorchester.  A
 by-pass carries heavy traffic north of
 the village; the Frome runs to the    
 south.  The main street runs between. 
 A row of derelict cottages abuts it.a 
 few modernised thatched cottages still
 stand, having large gardens.  Blocks  
 of small new owner-occupied houses and
 flats predominate, with small gardens.
 Plans are in progress for larger homes
 each with minute gardens, showing     
 suburban influence.  Ash Hill is a    
 small cluster  of council houses away 
 from Stratton itself, built in the    
 1950's.  Some are now privately owned.
