		<title>20SOCIAL CONCERNS.</title>
		<content> Proposals giving rise to petitions,   
 meetings etc include industrial       
 development in Pyrford, extension of  
 Heathrow-Gatwick Helicopter link and  
 loss of woodland. Existing problems   
 include aircraft noise, heavy traffic 
 on minor roads, roadside litter,      
 vandalism  and burglaries. Ockham Post
 Office was robbed and it is known that
 the proximity of the A3 and M25 is    
 encouraging burglars from London who  
 can make a swift getaway. Local       
 opinion in this rural area is strongly
 opposed to further development. Active
 social work includes helping the      
 disabled, conservation projects,      
 rubbish clearance, tree planting,     
 Parish work, fund raising, visiting   
 the house-bound,running clubs and     
 generally contributing to the welfare 
 of the young and aged.
