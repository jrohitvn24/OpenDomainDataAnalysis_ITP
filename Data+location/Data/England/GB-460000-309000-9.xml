		<content>   Barkby has changed very little in   
 the last hundred years apart from the 
 arrival of electricity and telephone  
 poles.                                
                                       
   There is only one shop in the       
 village. This sells almost everything 
 and is the Post Office as well. The   
 only other public buildings are two   
 Public Houses,one of which is the Malt
 Shovel built before 1271,a Village    
 Hall, the Pochin (Primary) School and 
 the parish church.                    
                                       
   The church is full of memorials to  
 members of the Pochin family, who have
 been the dominant landowners for      
 centuries and are still patrons of the
 church and live in the Hall. On the   
 pulpit is carved: "Thy word is a lamp 
 to my feet". Outside is the cemetary  
 which includes some iron headstones.  </content>
