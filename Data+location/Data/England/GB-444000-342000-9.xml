		<title>09TWO COUNCIL ESTATES</title>
		<content> There are two council estates in      
 Cotmanhay.{Cotmanhay Farm Estate}was  
 built in 1952;{Hopewell Farm Estate}  
 was built in 1972. Louise has lived on
 both of them.                         
 I live on{Cotmanhay Farm Estate.}The  
 shops are very near. My house has got 
 five  rooms which are quite large. We 
 have got three bedrooms, a kitchen and
 a living room. All the houses are the 
 same around the estate. On the map the
 estate looks as if it is shaped like a
 bell.                                 
 The{Hopewell Farm}houses have smaller 
 rooms and smaller gardens. The house I
 lived in had only got two bedrooms.   
 From the outside the houses look like 
 boxes. There were no shops around us  
 but a mobile shop came round selling  
 sweets, bread, sugar and other basics.
