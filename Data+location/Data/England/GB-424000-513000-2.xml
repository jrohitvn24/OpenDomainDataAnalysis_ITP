		<title>02FOOD IN DARLINGTON</title>
		<content>  This year natural food has been      
 emphasised as being the best thing    
 for you. Advertisements on the        
 television,in magazines, newspapers   
 and in the streets are always saying  
 diet, eat brown bread and margarine,  
 not white bread and butter. Meat is on
 sale all year round whatever the      
 season. The same goes for vegetables. 
 Not all, but most, you can buy all    
 year round; if not fresh, frozen.     
 Keep fit is now a trend and just about
 everyone does something towards       
 keeping healthy. Fruit and fruit      
 juices are popular so are natural     
 foods like yogurt and brown bread     
 which are good for you. Junk food like
 chips and beefburgers are bad for you 
 because they contain too much fat     
 which makes a heart attack more       
 possible.
