 prize for each race was Â£1, second    
 prize 50p and third 25p.              
 There is also Gala Day which includes 
 a pram race where all the competitors 
 wear fancy dress. They set off from   
 the dock and finish at the Fylingdales
 Inn. The winner receives a cup. The   
 children take part in a sandcastle    
 competition which is held below the   
 sea wall where there is most sand.    
 Coins are placed in a line down Bay   
 Bank at the side of the road. The     
 money donated is for the Parish Hall. 
 In the Autumn Fylingthorpe and Robin  
 Hoods Bay have bonfires, one at Thorpe
 above the park and one at Bay below   
 the sea wall. Soup and other          
 refreshments are provided and the     
 fireworks are supervised by the local 
 firemen.
