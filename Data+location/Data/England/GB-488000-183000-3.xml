 village had doubled in size since     
 then,and that the numbers of cars had 
 increased dramatically.He said that   
 the other major change was in the     
 nature of the shops in the{High St.   
 Where once there had been shops to    
 serve the local community now there   
 were only shops to cater for the      
 tourists.Many people that we          
 interviewed expressed the same regret 
 and were concerned that older         
 residents had to go up to the{Rise}for
 basic shopping.The rail services had  
 decreased with the closure of the line
 which used to run through{Bourne End  
 to High Wycombe.The interior of the   
{Church}had changed considerably and   
 there were many more people now       
 attending the services.Many people    
 felt that the car park on the{Moor}was
 a change for the worse.               </content>
