		<content>  Our area covers the Pitsea,Barstable 
 and Vange districts of Basildon.In    
 these areas there is much New Town    
 housing.Bowers Gifford  is also       
 included in our grid reference.       
 Although this comes within Basildon   
 district it is not designated for New 
 Town development.                     
 There are several neighbourhood       
 shopping areas,but the major shopping 
 centre in our block is in Pitsea where
 there is a  large superstore and an   
 open market is held twice a week.     
 A country park lies to the south of   
 the block and there ara also several  
 other areas of open space.There is    
 much grazing and farmland to the      
 south and east of the area.           
 A small area of warehousing and       
 untidy industry is situated south of  
 Pitsea Railway station.
