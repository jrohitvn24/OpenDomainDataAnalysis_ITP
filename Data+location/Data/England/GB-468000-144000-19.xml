		<content> There are no Council houses in this   
 block. All the houses are privately   
 owned with the exception of 5 tied    
 farm labourer's cottages and the farm 
 houses which are all occupied by      
 tenant farmers, the farms being owned 
 by large estates or consortiums. In   
 Weston Patrick the houses are mostly  
 old 17th Cent. cottages with modern   
 extensions with modern infill housing 
 all of which blends in well. Powntley 
 Copse is an estate of large detached  
 houses built in the 1930's,with 1-2   
 acre gardens where the owners have set
 up a Residents Association to manage  
 the maintenance of the road and       
 services. Other housing in the block  
 consists mostly of isolated farmhouses
 or cottages some of which have been   
 upgraded and modernised and bought by 
 commuters working in London.
