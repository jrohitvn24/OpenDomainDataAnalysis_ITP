   The Valley is crossed by the Oxford 
 Canal, the M45 Motorway and the main  
 London/Liverpool railway.             
                                       
   The Oxford canal is now mainly used 
 for pleasure. Along the southern edge 
 of the canal there are approximately  
 ten moorings on which people live     
 permenantly.                          
                                       
   The M45 cuts between Kilsby and     
 Barby and down into the valley on its 
 way from the M1 towards Coventry.     
                                       
   The railway comes out of Kilsby     
 Tunnel and heads towards Rugby. The   
 trains begin to slow down just after  
 leaving the tunnel.
