		<content>     First I get up at about half past 
 seven because my sister goes to a     
 secondary school in Canterbury and has
 to catch the Plucks Gutter bus at     
 7.55. I get up at the same time       
 because I can help pack her lunch.    
 After my sister has caught her bus I  
 talk to my mum and sometimes I watch  
 the television. I dress and wash and  
 go up stairs and tidy my room. At     
 about 8.30 I grab my coat and bag and 
 wait for Kelly. We take her to school 
 and her mum picks us up in the        
 afternoon.                            
   {  ***** At School. *****           
     First we have assembly; we sing   
 songs and one of the teachers  tells  
 us a story. After assembly we have our
 lessons; sometimes we have the Rector 
 who teaches us R.E. After school we   
 have some clubs like Gym Club,        
 Computer Club and various others.     </content>
