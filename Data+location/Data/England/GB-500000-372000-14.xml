		<title>14FIRMS: CHERRY WILLINGHAM</title>
		<content>   In Cherry Willingham there are no   
 major firms. Cherry Willingham has 17 
 shops employing about 40 staff        
 although the shops are not all in one 
 place in the village. There are five  
 local builders who employ about 25    
 staff. The three paper shops employ   
 local teenagers to deliver the        
 newspapers.                           
   There is a small woodworking firm in
 Reepham although a major change is    
 taking place on the edge of our block 
 with the building of the 'Welton Oil  
 Field' which will include a railway   
 siding.                               
    The local schools- there are four  
 of them- also employ dinner ladies and
 cleaners. Other than that the majority
 of people go into Lincoln to find     
 employment.                           
   At Greetwell there is a quarry which
 employs about 30 people.   S.PROCTOR  </content>
