		<title>14THE COLLINS FAMILY</title>
		<content> The Collins family who live at Chy    
 Billy are the{national family darts } 
{champions}of Britain.They are closely 
 related and find it very difficult to 
 find good opponents.They play for the 
 Gweek Social Club Darts Team.The men  
 play every Friday and the women play  
 every Wednesday.There are four men and
 five women.They started playing in    
 1964 and have won{130 trophies}which  
 fill their living room.               
 They also enter enormous vegetables   
 for local shows and have won a{bronze}
{medal in horticulture.}They gave us a 
 tip for growing very long leeks. First
 dig a trench and put a couple of      
 centimeters of{coal dust}in the       
 bottom.Then you put the leeks in and  
 water them.                           
 The Collins family get their water by 
 pumping it up from a{bore hole}which  
 is in their{back garden. }            </content>
