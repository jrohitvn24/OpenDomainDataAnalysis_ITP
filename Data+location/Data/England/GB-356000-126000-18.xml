           Situated just off the A303, 
 Hazlegrove has a very scenic setting  
 with a large park, full with trees.   
 Although many Elms were killed due to 
 Dutch Elm disease, an attempt is being
 made to make a new grove.             
           A wide range of sports and  
 hobbies are taught and encouraged all 
 through the year, ranging from codes  
 to gardening to rugby.                
           A sports hall, called The   
 Dolphin Hall, can be used for a       
 variety of sports: Hockey, Basketball,
 Tennis, Badminton and many others.    
 Ajoined to this is a Chapel / Cinema /
 Theatre / Assembly Hall. Also ajoined 
 to the sports hall are two squash     
 courts.                               
           The school also has some    
 woods around the back, where the boys 
 enjoy building dens.                  </content>
