		<content>     There are classes to help parents 
 understand what we children are doing 
 with computers, and there are several 
 Computer Groups where people with     
 computers exchange ideas (and probably
 copy programs!)                       
     There are several courses         
 concerned with women - Women's Rights,
 for example. There is a lot of concern
 that womwn are treated unfairly by    
 men, and they do not have the same    
 opportunities.                        
     People who have retired have      
 special classes provided for them, and
 lots of older people now "go to       
 school"                               
     Other opportunities include:      
 Photography, Fishing, Playing the     
 Guitar,Local and Family History (See  
 above), First Aid........
