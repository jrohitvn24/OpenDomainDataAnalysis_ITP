		<title>15Witherley Hall: the past</title>
		<content> Witherley Hall is the largest house in
 the village of Witherley, and possibly
 stands on the site of the original    
 manor house of the village.           
                                       
 The present Hall was originally the   
 Rectory. After 1886 it became the home
 of the wealthy land-owning            
 Chamberlayne family, who lived there  
 until the 1920's. The house then lay  
 empty until 1939 when it was taken    
 over for the Army to use. It was used 
 successively to house Dunkirk         
 survivors, soldiers preparing stores  
 for the D-Day landings and Italian and
 German prisoners-of-war.              
                                       
 Since 1979 the Hall has been lived in 
 by Major and Mrs Aubrey Chalmers, who 
 have undertaken extensive restoration.
