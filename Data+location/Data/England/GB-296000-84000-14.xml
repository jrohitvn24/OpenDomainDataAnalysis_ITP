unusual(sometimes dangerous to lorries)
addition of an extending room over the 
porch.There are other thatched cottages
in Exton.Notable buildings in the      
village include the pretty,gabled      
Victorian school,where use was made of 
wooden shingles for decoration.This is 
now a business premises.               
The Puffing Billy Pub is not unusual   
but is renowned for its Falklands      
mementos.The former railway station    
has been converted to a"haute-cuisine" 
restaurant.Exton is unusual in that    
there is no church in the village,only 
a chapel.(see population of Exton)
