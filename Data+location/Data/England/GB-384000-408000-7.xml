   I like coming to school because I   
 can see and talk to my friends. Also I
 like it because I enjoy some of the   
 lessons, like P.E.,Art, Reading,      
 History and Maths. If I did not come  
 to school, I would not be able to     
 learn. Also, if I stayed at home      
 everyday I would get bored, because in
 the seven week holiday, I get bored.  
   I do not like coming to school      
 because I do not like some of the     
 lessons, such as Geography and        
 Science, and I do not like assemblies.
   I try my best at school because I   
 think it might help me to get a job   
 when I grow up. I am also not keen on 
 school because if you misbehave you   
 get told off, but I think that that is
 only for your own good.
