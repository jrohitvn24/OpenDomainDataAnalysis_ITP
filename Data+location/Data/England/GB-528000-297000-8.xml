   "I got up  at 7 o'clock in the      
 morning. I got drest and I went down  
 wen my mum got up and had my          
 breakfast and I went to school and we 
 went to play and wen we came in we    
 went to the pond - all of the tables -
 to look at the fish."

   "Yesterday at school, I started a   
 new English book called 'Oxford Junior
 English'. It is a sort of sentence    
 teacher, because it shows you pictures
 and at the bottom of the page are some
 sentences and you match them up with  
 the pictures. Then we did  some       
 Scottish Maths, and some writing      
 about                                 
  the creatures and plants in the      
 school pond."
