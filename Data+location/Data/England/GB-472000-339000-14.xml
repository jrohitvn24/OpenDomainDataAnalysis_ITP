		<title>14FARMING</title>
		<content> Farming is very important in the      
 Aslockton and Whatton area.   It is   
 mainly an agricultural area, but there
 are a mixture of different types of   
 farm.   The main crop grown is wheat, 
 but oats, barley and rape are also    
 grown.  Alot of the farmers fields    
 change what they grow every year. they
 grow lots of rape because it is used  
 to make margerine and for food for    
 cows.  It also fetches alot of money  
 in. This year one farmer grew onions  
 and you could smell them. There is    
 also a poultry farm nearby and some   
 sheep are kept for grazing.  One farm 
 in Old Whatton is famous for it's herd
 of Fresian cattle and bulls. Farmers  
 come to the farm with their cows to   
 get them mated so that they will give 
 lots of milk. The cattle are also     
 worth lots of money.
