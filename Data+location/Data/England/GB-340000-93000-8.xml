		<content>    There are some 20 farms in the area
 many of them around 100 acres in size.
 One exception to this size factor is  
 the farming complex centred around    
 Chideock Manor which is run on a      
 partnership basis and covers 1100     
 acres.                                
    A third of thre farms are owned by 
 working farmers while the remainder   
 are tennant farmers. Many are family  
 farms employing few permanent         
 employees outside the immediate       
 family. Extra help is hired at certain
 times of the year and some work is put
 out to contract.                      
    It is predominantly a dairy farming
 area with sheep in addition and a few 
 farmers also keep pigs.
