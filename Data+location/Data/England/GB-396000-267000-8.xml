		<content> Mr.Leak screamed and he is now deaf in
 his right ear.                        
  His wife used to live in the Chateaux
 Impney,she died there.She now haunts  
 the Chateaux Impney.Many people around
 and in Stoke Prior have seen John     
 Corbett's ghost.I collected this      
 information from Trudy Peplow who has 
 seen John Corbett's ghost.            
  {The Black Cross}                    
  The ghost of the Black Cross was     
 supposed to be an old man who drank at
 the pub.Sometimes he goes to the Black
 Cross to haunt,he goes down tothe     
 cellar and knocks down the            
 bottles.Then he appears and slams the 
 till,he pours pints of bear but you
