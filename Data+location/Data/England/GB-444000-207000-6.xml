		<title>06Wytham, the local directory</title>
		<content>    The parish of Wytham covers 806    
 hectares. The population of Wytham is 
 152 people. The local directory gave  
 us an idea of where they lived.       
    There is consecutive numbering of  
 cottages from 6-30. Then the buildings
 can be identified individually. Some  
 names tell us who lived there at some 
 time:Gardener's Cottage, Keeper's     
 Cottage, Old School, School House, the
 Post Office, Wytham Abbey, the Dower  
 House and the Rectory. Some names tell
 us what could be found at that place: 
 Old Laundry Cottage, Orchard Cottage, 
 the Bothy, Garage Cottages, White Hart
 Inn and the Glebe. The last group show
 how rural the area is: Home, Linch,   
 Northfield, Overfofd and Wytham Mill  
 Farms,with the modern additions of the
 Laboratory and the Field Station. One 
 cottage called "Hornbeams" completes  
 the entries in the directory (1985).  </content>
