		<title>19Deaconess at Swineshead</title>
		<content> In October 1983, a rather unusual     
 event took place in Swineshead at St. 
 Nicholas Church. A lady from          
 Pertenhall was made Deaconess. The    
 service was performed by the Bishop of
 Bedford. The reason it was so unusual 
 is becausethiservice is usually done  
 at the Abbey, not at the local church.
 The Deaconess7 role is that she can   
 take a fairly active role within the  
 Church, performing a large part of the
 service and other church duties.
