		<content>{MRS HODSON FROM THE "OLDE BAKERY"     
  Mrs Hodson owns Raunds bakery/cafe.  
 The bakery does not have the ovens to 
 bake its own bread but has it         
 delivered from a Kettering bakery.The 
 bakery does bake 2/3 of its own cakes.
  Her assistant arrives at 7:30 am and 
 starts work straight away.Mrs Hodson  
 arrives at 7:45 am.Before the shop    
 opens at 9:00 am they have to prepare 
 the cafe's dinner,turn the ovens on,  
 make the fresh cream,put out the stock
 and make sure the shop is clean.When  
 this is done it is time for the shop  
 to open.On average 100 loaves are sold
 a day of which sliced white are the   
 most popular.The most popular cakes   
 are fresh cream cakes.They have many  
 regular customers,alot of them buy    
 brown or wholemeal bread.
