		<title>05RANSKILL WALK (EAST)</title>
		<content> We walked just over the bridge down   
 Mattersey Road,when on our right we   
 came to Bridge House,which is now     
 deserted,next to the railway.Also,on  
 the same side as Bridge House it is   
 quite unusual in that there is some   
 livestock(sheep.)When we look across  
 the road to the other side we see some
 cereal crop(either wheat or barley.)  
 Next to the crop field is another     
 cereal-crop field,but this time ,there
 are poppies in the field,this suggests
 that the farmer did not use as much   
 spray on the crops.On the same side,  
 next to another field of poppies is an
 ex-gravel pit,an old quarry,but now it
 is reclaimed land and it has been     
 filled with water.Then on the right   
 near the gates of Tarmac(a concrete   
 and cement company)was a dead         
 grassnake.In the Tarmac grounds there 
 is only 1 duck left!Continued on P15{ </content>
