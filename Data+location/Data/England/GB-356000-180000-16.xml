		<title>16My school day, in Patchway</title>
		<content>   I woke up, got dressed, made my bed 
 and ate my breakfast. I got ready and 
 set off. I kissed my mum and went in. 
 We went into the classroom then in 5  
 minutes the bell rang for service.    
 Sharon and I asked Sir if we could    
 clean out the paint cupboard. He said 
 "Yes" so the others went into service 
 and we started right away.            
 Then the  class came back. We did     
 Maths until break time. After we had  
 English. At dinner time I went home.  
   After dinner we went to music, then 
 P.E. then we went to the school       
 library. We all changed our library   
 books and read. Then we went back to  
 class and did some more reading and   
 writing. The bell went to go home. I  
 watched T.V. and had my tea. After I  
 watched "Top of the Pops" I went to   
 bed, read, and went to sleep.
