The population of Watchfield during the
second world war was very large because
there used to be an airfield at the    
edge of Watchfield .Mr. Curtis said    
that first the airfield was once used  
for joy rides but the paratroopers took
over at the beginning of the war.It was
a lot quieter after the war.The        
airfield was not used for long and it  
soon fell into disrepair and was pulled
down.Now the land is being sold.In fact
the bypass was built on part of the old
airfield.                              
Mr. Curtis was awarded the British     
Empire Medal by the Queen in 1981 for  
services to Watchfield and the         
community.
