 Most Saturdays,because it isn't       
 school,I get up about 8.30/9,00a.m.   
 and watch television in my pyjamas.I  
 go up with my Mum into Easingwold.    
 Later I have decided to go fishing so 
 I get some maggots.I have my lunch    
 then go round to my Gran's to fish.It 
 is an old brick pond which has been   
 mostly filled in and restocked with   
 fish. I catch mostly perch,sometimes 3
 or 4.I have caught as many as 12.I    
 usually have a pack-up for my tea.    
 When I get back,if Dad has any jobs I 
 can help him with,I do.Then I have a  
 swing in the dutch barn and watch     
 television for the rest of the night. 
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
