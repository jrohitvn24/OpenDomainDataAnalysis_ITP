		<title>19How is Whitminster Changing.</title>
		<content> Over the past ten years many of the   
 Gloucestershire villages have changed 
 their character drastically.          
 Employment on the land is not the only
 choice available to local people as it
 once was. With easy access to Bristol 
 and Gloucester many residents no      
 longer work directly in the area in   
 which they live. Whitminster in common
 with these is in danger of becoming a 
 dormitory village occupied by those   
 who can afford to buy Cotswold        
 cottages rather than local people who 
 have been raised in the traditions of 
 the area.                             
                                       
 Much of the modern development in the 
 area is out of keeping with the       
 surrounds and needs to be carefully   
 monitored if the village is not to    
 lose its character completely.
