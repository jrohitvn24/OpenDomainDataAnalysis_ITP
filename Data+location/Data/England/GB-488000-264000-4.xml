Continued from page 3. The schools in  
this area also include a secondary     
school which accepts children in the   
year they reach eleven year's old.     
Children have to stay at school until  
they reach sixteen when they may leave 
to take up employment or further       
education or they may stay on, usually 
for two more years, to undertake       
further education which may include    
GCE A levels or other courses of       
study. The School accepts children     
from a wide area where their parents   
have requested that they should attend 
the John Lea Comprehensive school but  
most of the children come form the     
immediate area around the school in    
Wellingborough and from the villages   
of Earls Barton and Great Doddington.
