		<title>20CORNISH  WRESTLING</title>
		<content> Wrestlers are matched at particular   
 weights and tournaments take place all
 over Cornwall throughout the summer to
 decide on a Cornish champion at each  
 particular weight.  Catchweight       
 contests are also held and open       
 competitions for children.            
 Cornish wrestling has much in common  
 with Breton wrestling and both share  
 the same Celtic origins.              
 Cornish wrestlers now regularly attend
 Celtic festivals in Brittany and      
 Breton wrestlers have visited Cornwall
 to take part in tournaments.          
 The revival in Cornish wrestling has  
 gone side by side with the increasing 
 interest in the Celtic origins and    
 customs of Cornwall.
