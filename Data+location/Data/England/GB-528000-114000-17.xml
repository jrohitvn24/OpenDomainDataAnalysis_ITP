		<title>17The Windmills C.J. School</title>
		<content>  This junior school opened in 1967    
 with about 230 children in eight      
 classes. Before then the infants and  
 juniors went to one school (an old    
 Victorian village school which is now 
 just for infants).                    
  The numbers have been as high as 430 
 children in thirteen classes. Two of  
 these classes had to use rooms in the 
 Downlands secondary school. A new     
 open-plan wing was built in 1971 for  
 three classes. This wing is now       
 divided as one classroom, a library, a
 music room and a resources area; we   
 use this for computer work and to be  
 near the library for reference. The   
 number of children is now back to     
 about 240 in eight classes.           
  There are now fewer children in      
 Hassocks than ten years ago but the   
 total population is about the same.
