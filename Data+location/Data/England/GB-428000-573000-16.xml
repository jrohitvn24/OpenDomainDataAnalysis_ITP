		<content> Our group worked on the topic of{     
{communication}and we started by       
 looking at old maps. This was because 
 we wanted to find out where the{Post  
{Office} had been when the centre of   
 Seaton Delaval had been near our      
 school. Our caretaker, Mr. Jacques,   
 could remember when he was a boy      
 playing near it. The Post Office was  
 built on the gable end of Double Row  
 and just outside the door was a slope 
 up to the road. In the winter the boys
 played on the slope on their sledges  
 and used the counter of the Post      
 Office to stop themselves! The        
 Postmaster,Mr. Gleghorn, was not      
 amused. Today the Post Office is at   
 the Avenue Head and is a sweet shop as
 well. Of course, our most modern form 
 of Communication is this{computer}and 
 the{videodisc}which will store the new
 Domesday Book.                        </content>
