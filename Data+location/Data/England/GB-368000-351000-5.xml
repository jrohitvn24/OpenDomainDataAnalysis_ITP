		<content> The main local centres of employment  
 for our block are Rolls Royce Motor   
 Company and Crewe Works where engines 
 are made for British Railways trains. 
 The shops and businesses in and around
 Crewe employ a large number of our    
 residents as do County Council        
 establishments. A fairly high         
 proportion of men commute daily       
 further afield to centres such as     
 Stoke-on-Trent and Manchester for     
 their employment. More and more jobs  
 involve the use of computers. There is
 also a high proportion of teachers    
 living in our unit. Women work mostly 
 on a part-time basis but a growing    
 number are seeking full-time          
 emplyment. These jobs tend to be      
 locally-based, and secretarial work is
 still popular among women.            
 Unemployment in the area is not high.
