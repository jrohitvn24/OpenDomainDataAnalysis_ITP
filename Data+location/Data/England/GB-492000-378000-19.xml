		<title>19GREENS GARAGE, AISTHORPE</title>
		<content> The garage has been in the Greens     
 family for 15 years. Mr. George Green,
 the owner, has three children.  One   
 daughter and his son help at the      
 garage.  His son, David, is a keen    
 sportsman.  He has won many events in 
 dressage and cross country on his     
 horse Fred.  He also enjoys water     
 skiing and has his own speedboat.  The
 garage is a great asset to the village
 it serves petrol and also gives the   
 vehicles resprays and servicing and   
 performs M.O.T. tests.  The garage    
 opens every day at 8 o'clock and      
 closes at 6 o'clock on a week day.    
 Although the family live close to the 
 garage it has been broken into and    
 items have been stolen.  Mr. Green has
 recently had a heart operation from   
 which he is recovering well.  Mrs.    
 Green helps her husband and is also   
 caretaker at Scampton Village School. </content>
