		<content>   Oteley, known in Saxon times as the 
 clearing or field where oats grew,    
 became well-known in later days for   
 its lovely Elizabethan mansion and    
 deer park.                            
   Later a stone-built mansion was     
 lived in from 1838 untill 1960,when it
 was pulled down to make room for a    
 more modern brick house,which the     
 family moved into for Christmas 1962  
 and live in today.                    
   The lovely walled gardens with      
 espaliered trees and enclosed         
 vegetable gardens are still there, but
 the Deer Park no longer exists. There 
 are many fir trees and rhododendrons  
 in the park, which is occasionally    
 open to the public.                   
   The farm at Oteley produces wheat   
 and barley. Beef cattle are also      
 reared and there is fine coarse       
 fishing on the estate.                </content>
