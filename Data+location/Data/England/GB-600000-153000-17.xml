		<content> An overhead line of electricity pylons
 crosses the area from West to East.   
 Electricity is supplied to all houses 
 by overhead cable, so power breakdowns
 are a problem particularly since many 
 homes are not linked to any other     
 energy source.  Supplies of candles   
 and oil lamps are kept for such       
 emergencies.  A gas main follows the  
 A25l and mains gas is piped to most   
 properties along it.  Gas is still the
 cheapest fuel for cooking and heating.
 Alternatives to gas and electric      
 cookers are Aga Stoves (oil or solid  
 fuel burning), Calor gas and solid    
 fuel stoves.  Many central heating    
 systems are oil fired.  Because of the
 high cost of heating fuel and         
 availability of wood due to Dutch Elm 
 Disease many homes are installing wood
 burning stoves for cooking and heating
