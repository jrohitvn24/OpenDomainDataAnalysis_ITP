		<title>09HOME/FAMILY LIFE NASH AREA</title>
		<content> Family life in the village is         
 conducted at a fast pace. People      
 commute by car to nearby cities or by 
 rail to London, Northampton etc.      
 Children are transported by bus to    
 local schools.                        
 Many wives work. This often requires a
 second car, a structured day and more 
 labour saving devices in the home.    
 Most have washing machines, tumble    
 dryers and vacuum cleaners, some have 
 microwaves to speed up food           
 preparation. Fast food has infiltrated
 the diet.                             
 To limit expense home owners often "Do
 it Yourself", consequently fewer      
 tradesmen visit. A few homes have     
 security systems, isolated farms      
 relying on guard dogs.                
 Most families have a variety of pets. 
 In an area where hunting is popular   
 horses and ponies are also kept.      </content>
