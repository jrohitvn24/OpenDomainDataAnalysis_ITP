		<content>   I usually get up at 7 a.m. and      
having washed and dressed I come       
downstairs to have my breakfast. I     
usually have a cereal such as a rusk or
Weatabix and a drink of coffee. At     
about 8-30 a.m. I set off for school,  
if it is fine I walk, if it is raining 
my mum takes me by car. I get to       
school in time for a short play with my
friends before school starts at 9 a.m. 
We begin with an assembly during which 
we talk about some interesting topic,  
say some prayers and sing a hymn or    
song. On Wednesday morning the assembly
is taken by Father Keith our Parish    
Priest. The rest of the morning is     
usually spent on mathmatics &amp; English  
exercises. I have a school dinner but  
most of my friends bring a packed lunch
box.We play until afternoon school     
begins at 1 p.m.                       
                                       </content>
