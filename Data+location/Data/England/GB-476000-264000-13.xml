		<content>The schools nowadays go on trips maybe 
about the project the classes          
are doing. Trips that have been        
carried out by the sdchool are the     
cattle Market,Daily Bread Centre and   
Stoke   Bruerne. Everdon for example   
cost about   20.00 pounds for three    
days and three nights and on that the  
classes went to the local church,a     
field trip to see the hounds. The      
Cattle Market was only a day trip and  
cost 2.00 pounds per child and that    
was really only for the coach as to    
get into the Cattle Market addmission  
is free. On this trip we looked at the 
sheep being clipped by men and sold by 
an auctioners standing outside on a    
platform above five sheep. The         
auctioners were shouting out numbers,  
inside a building that was set out     
like a circus ring.
