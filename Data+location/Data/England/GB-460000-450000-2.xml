 A DAY IN THE LIFE OF NICHOLAS.MORNING 
 On Sunday I got up at 6:50am I        
 watched Rub A Dub Tub on TV at        
 7:00am.After that I watched Are       
 You Awake Yet? At 8.30am I got dressed
 put on   my clothes which were a pair 
 of swankers,a tee shirt,white socks,my
 white shoes and a blue coat with a    
 couple of red stripes.I had three     
 Weetabix and milk and went to the     
 papershop for the Sunday papers.I went
 to call for my friend but he wasn't up
 so I went to my aunty's house.At 11.00
 I went to call for David again and we 
 decided to go to the swimming baths.We
 walked 1km stopping at a shop to buy  
 some crisps.At the swimming baths I   
 paid 15p to get in,changed into my    
 swimming costume,put my clothes in a  
 basket and handed them to the         
 attendant who stored them.            </content>
