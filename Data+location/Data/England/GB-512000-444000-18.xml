		<content>     Sigglesthorne has not featured in 
 any national events of significance.  
     There is an entry in the{Domesday 
 Book for Sigglesthorne, which         
 translated into modern English is:    
     In  Sigglesthorne eight carucates 
   of land to be taxed. There  is one  
   plough in the demesne and fourteen  
   villeins and five bordars having six
   ploughs. There is a priest and a    
   church and sixteen acres of meadow. 
    Sigglesthorne was included in the  
 list of the berewicks of St.Johns     
 Church{Beverley.                      
     Sigglesthorne has paid its Tithes 
 and{taxes,}sent its men to{war,       
{billeted}servicemen and{evacuees,}but 
 has largely let the world pass by     
 changing slowly in response to the    
 economic factors of the time.
