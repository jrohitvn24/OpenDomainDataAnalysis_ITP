		<title>10Village Hall &amp; Playing Field</title>
		<content> The playing field was bought by the   
 people of Baltonsborough.             
 The top half has a village hall which 
 was built about 12 years ago. The     
 bottom half was bought about 3 years  
 ago. Money was raised by sponsored    
 splashes, fayres, lotteries, loans    
 and a grant.                          
 The hall and field are managed by     
 representatives of village            
 organisations and belong to the people
 of the parish. The Parish Council are 
 the trustees.                         
 There is one paid employee, the care- 
 taker. The hall provides facilitles   
 for a youth-club, Cubs, Brownies,     
 cricket, football, the school and the 
 Horticultural Society as well as for  
 for private parties.                  
 The upkeep of the hall is about       
 Â£1,000 annually.
