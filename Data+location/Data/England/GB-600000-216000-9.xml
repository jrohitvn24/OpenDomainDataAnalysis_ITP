		<title>09PETE TYE COMMON</title>
		<content> On the south side of the village of   
{Abberton}lies{Pete Tye Common.        
                                       
 The{Common}is used for lots of things 
 like flying kites and planes.         
 Sometimes the school plays games on   
 it.Up until three years ago the school
 had its sports day there.There are oak
 and willow trees and a pond in the    
 middle.In the summer the farmers cut  
 the grass for hay. We are lucky       
 because the common is so close to     
 us,and we can see the fields.You are  
 not allowed to build houses on common 
 land.                                 
                                       
 The{Common}was originally part of the 
 land belonging to the{manor of Pete.  
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
