		<title>18OUR FAMILY'S SATURDAY.</title>
		<content> On Saturdays I go to Sunderland,to    
 watch football.I meet my friends in   
 Stanley and we catch the bus from the 
 bus station. When we get to Sunderland
 we go straight to Roker Park. The bus 
 picks you up after the match, and     
 takes you back to Stanley. It costs Â£1
 bus fare and Â£1.50 into the ground.   
  On Saturdays my dad puts his pigeons 
 in a race. He gets up at 7 am, goes   
 to the pigeon cree, he puts his best  
 pigeons into a basket which is loaded 
 onto the transporter. The transporter 
 comes to the Punch Bowl,Craghead and  
 takes the pigeons to places like      
 Brighton, Eastbourne, Southampton,    
 Portsmouth and Dover.                 
  My mam usually stays in the house    
 until 1 pm to make the dinner.She then
 goes shopping to Fine Fare, Stanley.My
 sister goes with her.                 
 The family watch television all night.</content>
