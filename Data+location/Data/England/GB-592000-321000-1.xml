		<title>01Brisley and Horningtoft</title>
		<content> This is a country area, where most of 
 the land is arable farmland. The block
 includes two small villages, Brisley  
 and Horningtoft, the eastern edge     
 of a third village, Whissonsett and   
 the northern edge of Stanfield.       
                                       
 The houses of Horningtoft are well    
 scattered, with a small group near the
 church. In Brisley the houses straggle
 along the roads leading from the      
 church.                               
                                       
 On the eastern side of Brisley is a   
 large common, called Brisley          
 Green, which is crossed by the road to
 North Elmham. The green is grazed by  
 cattle,sheep and horses. There are a  
 number of houses on the fringe of the 
 Green.
