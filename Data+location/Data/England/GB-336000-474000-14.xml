		<title>14Flookburgh Charter Fair</title>
		<content>   In the year of 1664,King Charles the
 Second,granted a{Royal Charter}to the 
 people of{Flookburgh,}allowing them to
 have a fair in the streets.This act   
 formalised an existing charter given  
 in the 13th century.                  
   Now the fair is held on the nearest 
 Saturday to Midsummers Day.Decorated  
 floats,entered by local groups,parade 
 through the streets.                  
   In 1985 I was selected to be{Charter
{Queen.}My family decorated a float for
 me and my court to travel to the field
 on the outskirts of the village,where 
 everyone gathered.                    
   On the field we celebrated the day  
 with competitions and games.There were
 stalls all around the arena, the money
 raised on the day was given to local  
 charities.                            
   The Charter is displayed in{St.John 
{the Baptist's Church,Flookburgh.      </content>
