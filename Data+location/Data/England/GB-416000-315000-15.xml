		<title>15Bell ringing in Alrewas</title>
		<content>                                       
On a Tuesday night at 7.30 p.m. you    
can hear peals of bells  ringing at    
Alrewas Church. This is the            
bellringers' practice night.About 11   
or 12 people go,but in all there are   
about 20 ringers.They ring for         
weddings and services.A fee of one     
pound fifty pence is paid for          
weddings.The youngest ringer is 7      
years old and the oldest is over 60.   
Most people think that bellringing is  
easy,just pull and pull again,but it is
harder than you think.Only eight people
can ring at one time because there are 
only  eight bells.We (Nicola and Emma) 
are 13 years old and have been ringing 
for 6 months. People who are beginners 
are not allowed to ring on their own   
until they are considered competent.
