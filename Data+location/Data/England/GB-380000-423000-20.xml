		<content> Included in our Domesday Project      
 activities was a traffic survey in    
 which we surveyed the number of       
 private cars and commercial           
 vehicles travelling along Burnley Road
 during school hours. Various field    
 trips were undertaken including visits
 to the Friends Meeting House, the     
 Manchester Diocesan Conference Centre,
 St. Johns Church, the Ski Slope, Marl 
 Pits Sports Centre and a coach trip   
 throughout our D-BLOCK.               
  An environmental survey was carried  
 out along the stretch of Burnley Road 
 running through Crawshawbooth. An     
 amenity index was compiled that showed
 the limited services and the need for 
 people to travel to nearby towns and  
 cities. Outside speakers visited the  
 school to assist the children with the
 project.                              
                                       </content>
