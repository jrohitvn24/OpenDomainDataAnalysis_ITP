		<content> dancing class.I put on my leotard and 
 a shirt on top of it.I put on an      
 elastic belt too.The class started at 
 4.30 and finished at 6.00.It was a    
 ballet class;Pre-Elementary.I enjoyed 
 the lesson,especially the free dance  
 Miss Mason(my teacher)made up.At      
 6.00,Icame home and watched the last  
 few minutes of the Keith Harris       
 Show.For tea,I had three spare ribs,  
 cheezers,(crisps)and a glass of       
 coke.I also had a piece of chocolate  
 cake and a penguin biscuit.I watched  
 the Price Is Right and then I went for
 a shower.After that,I made a hot      
 chocolate drink and watched           
 Dynasty.I went to bed at 9.45,but     
 I read until 10.15.I lay awake for a  
 while,but I soon fell asleep.I've     
 always liked Saturdays.
