		<title>10FARMERS WIFE</title>
		<content> The farmers wife gets up at half past 
 seven and makes a big breakfast for   
 the farmer. Later she washes any dirty
 clothes. Then she feeds the hens and  
 the calves.After that she goes inside 
 and very often bakes some cakes.      
 Mrs.Hutchinson enjoys baking and      
 patchwork and is member of the local  
 W.I. in Aislaby as well as being a    
 member of a sequence dancing club. She
 loves being a farmers wife and has    
 never wanted to be anything else. She 
 has no neighbours close by but is     
 always too busy in the house and      
 around the farm to be lonely.
