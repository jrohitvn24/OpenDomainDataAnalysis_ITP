		<title>04Methodist Chapel at Amble</title>
		<content> The Methodist chapel at Amble was     
 built in about 1840. There is also a  
{cemetery}on the road running South    
 West from the village. In the past    
 many local people attended and on{    
{special occasions}its pews would have 
 been full. Nowadays only 1 or 2 local 
 inhabitants attend. The chapel is     
 administered by the Methodist Church  
 at Wadebridge.{One service}is held    
 there every month. At Harvest,        
 Christmas and Easter all the people   
 from Wadebridge Methodist Church go to
 the chapel at Amble for a service with
 the Amble people. Even in summer with 
 the village{population}increased by   
 tourists few people attend the chapel.
 The{future}of the building is under   
 discussion.Does its  use justify the  
 cost of its{maintenance?
