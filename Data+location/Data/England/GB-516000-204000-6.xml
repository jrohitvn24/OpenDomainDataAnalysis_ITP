		<content> I was woken by my mum at 8.10 am. I   
 got dressed and washed. I didn't have 
 any breakfast. I went to school at    
 8.30 am. When the doors opened I put  
 the chairs down in the classroom. At  
 9.00 am the bell rang. I changed for  
 PE and went in the hall. At 10.15 am  
 we had assembly. We sang songs about  
 caterpillars. It was playtime at 10.40
 am. We came in at 11.00 am. We did a  
 maths project about the number of     
 possible seating arrangements in our  
 class. At 12.00 pm we had dinner. I   
 had packed lunch. I had crisps,       
 Cheddar biscuits and a drink. Then I  
 went out to play. At 1.30 pm I copied 
 out my maths project, then we had a   
 story. We went home at 3.30 pm. I     
 watched TV. I watched Dungeons and    
 Dragons. I had supper, then went to   
 bed at 9.05 pm.
