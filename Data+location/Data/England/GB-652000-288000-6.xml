		<title>06GISLEHAM TOXIC WASTE PIT</title>
		<content>This pit is situated at G.R. 530 888 to
the west of the A 12 and the holiday   
camp. It is used for the disposal of   
{industrial} toxic liquid              
waste. Originally a gravel pit, it has 
been in use for approximately fifteen  
years and has been a source of growing 
controversy amongst local residents.   
Some people regard the pit as a        
{health}  hazard. The holiday          
camp gate man complained of abnoxious  
smells emanating from the site.  He    
maintained that the water was          
travelling by underground streams. The 
groundsman had experienced a sudden    
gushing, like a geyser, on one         
occasion and had been overcome by      
fumes.  We observed a peculiar oil on  
the southern boundary but could not    
positively identify it.  The pit is    
quite small and is well screened from  
the road.                              </content>
