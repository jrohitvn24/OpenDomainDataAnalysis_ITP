      I get up at seven a.m., but I am 
not the first. My dad starts his milk  
round at four a.m.,delivering milk to  
people's homes. We have a farm shop and
nursery,where we sell fruit,vegetables,
dairy produce,garden plants and trees. 
We buy most of the goods from          
wholesalers.                           
      My grandfather keeps horses and  
sheep on some of our land.             
      Both of my parents used to be    
teachers,and taught in Jamaica for two 
years.I am called Gareth.I am ten years
old,and my sister Jane is eight.We set 
off for school at 8.30 a.m.,leaving my 
mother to look after the shop. At 9a.m.
my dad arrives home from his milk      
round,and works in the nursery.        
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
