		<title>14OWLERTON STADIUM</title>
		<content>   As you approach Owlerton Stadium it 
 looks shabby. It is surrounded by     
 steelworks with a huge carpark in     
 front.                                
   Inside it is a lot nicer with a     
 souvenir shop and snack bars. From the
 Panorama bar you have a good view of  
 the stadium.                          
   It is oval shaped, which Mr Carter  
 says is the best for high speeds.     
 Greyhound, stock-car and speedway     
 racing use the 420 metre track. In the
 middle, which is all grass, there is  
 rugby league and next year American   
 Football.                             
   The stadium holds about 12000 people
 comfortably, with many exits in case  
 of fire. It costs about Â£8000 a week  
 to run with high rates and is only    
 breaking even at the moment. The grey 
 hounds are nice, soft and gentle to   
 stroke and not ferocious.             </content>
