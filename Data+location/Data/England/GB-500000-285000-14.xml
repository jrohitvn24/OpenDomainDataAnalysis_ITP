		<title>14BARNWELL PARK _ WILDLIFE</title>
		<content> Barnwell Park has a main refuge in the
 middle of a lake.The kingfisher hide  
 which is on flat land is in a tree-   
 hut.You are not allowed to fish there 
 because it is the main kingfishers'   
 hide.There are many nest boxes to     
 encourage birds. The type of birds you
 can see are geese, coots, mallard,    
 moorhen and swans. You can also       
 see various animals particularly      
 rabbits which are in the warren.When  
 you go to a country park you must not 
 drop any litter. More wildlife could  
 be introduced but not too much        
 because it will get over crowded.
