		<content>     There is a Dr's surgery in the    
 Plough Hotel 1 morning/week, served by
 Drs. from the Skelton Practice 1o km  
 away. No public transport direct to   
 the main surgery.  Liverton is served 
 by the Loftus Health Centre and has no
 village surgery or public transport to
 Loftus surgery.                       
    Apart from the usual ailments there
 is a high incidence of osteoarthritic 
 hips (Almost twice national average)  
 requiring arthoplasty.                
    Moorsholm changed from spring to   
 mains water in 1958 as spring pressure
 was too low for modern farming        
 techniques and had to be chlorinated  
 by law. Water is electrically pumped  
 to top of Birk Brow and then gravity  
 fed. Sewage treated at village farm   
 and discharged in Hag Wood Stream.    
 Liverton is supplied from Scaling Dam 
 and sewage discharged via Loftus.     </content>
