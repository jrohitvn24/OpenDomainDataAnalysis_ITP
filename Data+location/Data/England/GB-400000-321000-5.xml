There are 17 working farms in the area.
My class visited all of them.Most      
people owned their farms very few      
rented. A number  of the old farm      
houses had been replaced by new ones;  
many of the old farmhouses were over a 
hundred years old and had been built   
over older buildings. Most farms had   
cows, some had sheep and a few had     
horses. The horses were not working    
horses. Cows were used for milk and    
beef. Freisian, Freisian/Hereford and  
Freisain/Charolais crosses were the    
most common types of cows. The farmers 
milked in morning and evening. The     
crops were mostly grass for silage and 
hay, winter barley, spring barley      
and wheat.Most farms had tractors,     
trailers, silerators, ploughs, harrows 
and drills. Only one farm had its own  
Combine Harvester.                     </content>
