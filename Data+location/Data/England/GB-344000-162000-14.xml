		<title>14TOURISM IN CONGRESBURY</title>
		<content> Cadbury Hill,just outside Congresbury,
 has the remains of an Iron Age fort   
 and a Roman Hill fort.Many ancient    
 coins and artifacts have been found in
 and around the village.There are      
 beautifull views of the Wrington Vale 
 and surrounding countryside from      
 Cadbury Hill.                         
         In the centre of Congresbury  
 is the village cross,this was the old 
 market cross and meeting place.       
         The Cheddar Valley Railway    
 line,the old strawberry line,ran      
 through the village.It was closed in  
 1963,it is now a footpath and you can 
 walk all the way to Cheddar.          
         You can walk along the banks  
 of the River Yeo.There is an annual   
 Tug of War contest across the Yeo the 
 loosers are pulled into the river.The 
 Yeo has flooded several times-last    
 time in 1968.                         </content>
