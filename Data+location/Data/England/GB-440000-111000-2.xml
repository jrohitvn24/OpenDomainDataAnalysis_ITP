 The Southampton Ice Rink, built in    
 1931, was land mined in the Second    
 World War. It was reopened in         
 September 1952. There was a Beginners'
 Rink that was turned into a buffet    
 while a new ice-pad was put down.     
 Beginners found it was easier to skate
 on the main rink, holding onto the    
 barrier. So the Beginners' Rink is now
 closed for good. It takes three days  
 to lay the ice from scratch. First the
 ice-pad must be cooled down           
 sufficiently to freeze the water,     
 which is then put on in thin coats. It
 takes thousands of gallons to get a   
 thickness of one inch.
