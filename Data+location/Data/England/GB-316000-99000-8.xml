		<content>   The pottery was established in 1881 
 upon the same site at the end of the  
 High Street.  Paul Redvers, the owner 
 employs 45 people.                    
   Traditionallly the pots were hand   
 painted but now there is a            
 photographic method of decoration.    
 Pottery is exported to 6 countries.   
   An attractive shop in front of the  
 factory sells a variety of goods to   
 the many visitors to the town;  lamps,
 crockery and baking dishes are most   
 popular.                              
  Visitors can see the moulding, firing
 and decoration processes in the       
 factory.                              
  There is also a coffee shop which    
 uses the crockery made at Honiton     
 Pottery.
