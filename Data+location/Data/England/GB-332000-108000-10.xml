		<title>10PLACES FOR KIDS IN CHARD</title>
		<content>  In Chard there are 6 play areas.In   
 the play areas there are usually:-    
 swings;a roundabout;a see-saw;a       
 paddling pool; a climbing frame;tubes.
 These play areas have just been       
 improved because people said there was
 not enough equipment so that the areas
 were boring.They are better now,but we
 don't think they are safe for children
 under the age of 5 by themselves.     
 In Chard there are about 3 well known 
 BMX tracks.The largest one is the most
 popular.                              
 Discoes are usually held on Fridays   
 because that is most convenient -no   
 school the next day!They are often    
 held in the Guildhall.                
 At Chard Youth Club we can play       
 snooker;darts;computer games........
