		<content> I attend the Junior School in         
 Recreation Ground Rd., Tenterden. The 
 Infants School is next door.  I went  
 there until last year when I was 7.   
 The head mistress there is Mrs.Harper.
 Our new headmaster is Mr.Weaver.      
 Recently we have changed the times    
 when we come to school and go home. We
 start school at 8.55am and work until 
 12.00. We have a mid-morning playtime 
 at 10.35am for about quarter of an    
 hour.Most children stay at school for 
 lunch.I have school dinners at 60p    
 each day, some have sandwiches. We    
 start school again at 1.10pm and we   
 work through the afternoon until we go
 home at 3.10pm. We go a little earlier
 so that it is not such a squash in the
 cloakroom. We do mostly Mathematics   
 and English in the morning and usually
 Science, Geography or Art after lunch.
 I shall go to Homewood School at 11.  </content>
