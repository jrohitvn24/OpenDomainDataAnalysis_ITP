		<title>14Banwell Caves and Monument</title>
		<content>     The bones in the cave are of      
 prehistoric animals. These include the
 huge cave bear, cave lion, reindeer,  
 wolf, hyaena,bison, mammoth and woolly
 rhinoceros.                           
     The actual house was built for    
{Bishop Law,}and had a fully landscaped
 garden with many grottos and a lot of 
 parkland. The house was the Bishop's  
 summer palace, and Bishop Law tower on
 top of Banwell Hill was used to call  
 the bishop back to Wells in an        
 emergency.                            
     The tower can only be seen in the 
 winter because the trees have grown   
 all around it. From the top of the    
 tower you can see both north and      
 south, as far as Wales to the north   
 and the Somerset levels to the south.
