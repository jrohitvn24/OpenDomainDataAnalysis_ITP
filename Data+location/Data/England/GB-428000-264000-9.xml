		<title>09Royal Pump Rooms, Leamington</title>
		<content> In 1491 John Rous,found the Spa       
 waters which contains many minerals   
 which is supposed to heal you.In 1814 
 the PUMP ROOMS were built over the    
 springs to pump the water up from     
 under the ground.Later on Queen       
 Victoria visited the pump rooms so    
 Leamington decided to call it the     
 ROYAL PUMP ROOMS instead of just pump 
 rooms.                                
 Nowadays the Pump Rooms are used to   
 give physiotherapy and hydrotherapy to
 members of the public. Here the       
 natural waters are used to provide    
 healing. The water is no longer drunk 
 voluntarily! There are controversial  
 plans for the future of the Pump Rooms
 which are in a poor state of repair.  
 These plans are aimed at the tourist  
 side of Leamington and Warwick.
