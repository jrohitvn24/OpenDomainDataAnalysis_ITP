		<content>   Although animal farming constitutes 
 only a small proportion of the overall
 farming in the area, many farms do    
 raise animals as a side-line. We found
 sheep, goats, turkeys, and horses as  
 well as the more common cattle. One   
 interesting farm is devoted to        
 free-range chicken production where   
 hundreds of chickens live freely in   
 chicken houses on a hillside. (See    
 slide).                               
   There is a market held in Cock      
 Clarks itself for the sale and        
 purchase of farm animals.             
   Although farming is so important to 
 the area, we were surprised at how    
 many derelict farms and buildings on  
 farmland we found.                    
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
