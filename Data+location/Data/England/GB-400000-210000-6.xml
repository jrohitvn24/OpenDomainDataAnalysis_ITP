		<content> Arable farming is much controlled by  
 the weather which controls any        
ploughing,planting or harvesting in    
their seasons.The busiest arable       
farming times are between July and     
October because these are the months   
when the silage cutting,harvesting &amp;   
baling are done.The ploughing is       
generally done in late summer-autumn &amp; 
the sowing of seeds is usually done in 
late autumn or early spring.           
    Those farmers that are mixed       
farmers are more regular in their      
farming patterns because they are      
concerned with arable and livestock    
farming.     With livestock farming ie 
dairy  herds the farmer has jobs all   
year round.A herd must be milked at    
6am &amp;   4pm for 4 hours every day.With 
sheep less attention is needed,except  
at lambing time(Feb.-April)and shearing
time(May-June).Beef cattle need least. </content>
