		<content>Cooling is a small hamlet close to the 
river Thames.It has two claims to fame.
Firstly,it has the ruins of a castle   
dating to the late (14th.It was built  
to fortify the manor house and was     
sited so that water flowing from the   
nearby hills would help flood the moat.
In 1554 the then owner,one George      
Cobham was involved in the Wyatt Rising
after Mary had succeeded to the throne 
the previous year.The site was sold in 
1942 to the Trustees of Rochester      
Bridge with whom it still remains.
