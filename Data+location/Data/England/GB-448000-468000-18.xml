 The chapel consists of a chancel 7.3m 
 long and 5.2m wide, a north chapel, a 
 nave 8.5m long and 5.8m wide, a north 
 and south aisle and a timber tower at 
 the west end-one of very few in this  
 county.There are bits of 12th century 
 remains of the original church notably
 the font and in the north arcade.     
 Otherwise parts of the chancel are    
 14th century and the west tower 15th  
 century.A lot of rebuilding was done  
 in 1879 because 'the whole pile is    
 rapidly hastening to ruins'.The south 
 aisle and porch were added at this    
 time.Further restoration was done in  
 1923, 1935 and 1954,though pieces of  
 medieval glass are left in the heads  
 of the east windows. It is worth a    
 visit.
