		<content> THE PRESENT OWNERS OPENED PYGMY       
 PINETUM GARDEN CENTRE IN 1967. IT     
 EMPLOYS 4 PEOPLE.  IT COVERS AN AREA  
 OF ONE ACRE AND HAS A STREAM RUNNING  
 THROUGH IT.                           
 THE FIRST YEAR THE CENTRE WAS OPENED  
 THEY HAD 80% TOURISTS &amp; 20% LOCALS AS 
 CUSTOMERS: THIS YEAR IT IS 80% LOCALS 
 &amp; 20% TOURISTS.                       
 ABOUT 80,000 PEOPLE VISIT EACH YEAR.  
 THEY GROW THE PLANTS IN CONTAINERS SO 
 BUYERS CAN PLANT THEM ALL YEAR ROUND. 
 THE ACER IS THE DEAREST PLANT AT Â£15  
 AND THE CHEAPEST COSTS 30-40 PENCE.   
 THE HEATHER IS THE BEST SELLING PLANT.
 A GREENHOUSE COST Â£3,500.             
 THEY HAVE SOME TROUBLE WITH VANDALISM 
 BUT VERY LITTLE STEALING.             
 THEY WOULD LIKE MORE PARKING SPACE &amp;  
 INTEND PLACING CHAIRS AND TABLES FOR  
 THE ELDERLY.
