		<content>  Although there is no mains sewerage  
 at Jenny Brown's Point and Crag Foot  
 and numbers 1,2,&amp;3 Brown's cottages   
 have no mains water, the residents all
 feel that the outstanding beauty of   
 the area is compensation, and they are
 obviously very happy with their       
 environment and particular way of     
 life. Some however are concerned about
 the nuclear power stations at Heysham 
 and at Sellafield on the Cumbrian     
 coast, particularly pollution of the  
 sea and its effects on the coastline. 
 Also nuclear waste is carried by the  
 railway close by. Others thought their
 rates were too high in view of the    
 lack of amenities. The lack of a mains
 gas supply is also a disadvantage.    
 There is no public transport to Jenny 
 Brown's Point nor to Crag Foot so     
 car ownership or love of walking      
 is essential.                         </content>
