		<content> There are four churches in Willingham;
 St.Mary's{(Church of England),}the    
 Tabernacle{(Baptist), Salvation Army  
 and{Methodist.}St.Mary's is the Parish
 Church, in charge of the Rector. From 
 about the year 1000 Willingham was    
 closely associated with the Abbots of 
 Ely and, after 1109 with the          
{Bishops of Ely.}For 600 years the     
 Church was the chief land-lord around 
 Willingham, most of the villagers     
 paying rent to or working for the     
 Bishop. About 35 families are regular 
 worshippers at St.Mary's. There is a  
{Sunday School,}attended by about 20   
 children, where they sing, write and  
 draw on biblical themes. The age range
 is from 3 to 12.                      
 The Salvation Army also has 4 classes 
 for children aged from 2 to 14. They  
 wear uniform: tie, hat and navy       
 skirt/trousers.                       </content>
