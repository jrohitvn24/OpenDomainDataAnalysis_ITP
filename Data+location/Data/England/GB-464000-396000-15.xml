		<title>15A GYPSY ENCAMPMENT</title>
		<content>        Doncaster has a large{gypsy    
{population}and some of these people   
 have an{encampment}next to the Old    
 Bawtry Road. At the moment there are  
 14 mobile{caravans,}although this     
 number varies week by week. Each      
 caravan is pulled by a{Bedford truck, 
 which doubles up as a lorry for moving
{scrap metal}when they are encamped.   
 Washing hangs from the hedgerow and   
 there are usually a few{fires}burning 
 casting{smoke}across the site.Children
 play around the caravans whilst the   
 boys and men spend their day breaking 
 up old{cars}to sell to{scrap metal    
{merchants.}The{local people}don't like
 their presence and are lobbying their 
 councillors to get them{moved}away.The
 local publicans refuse them entry to  
 the public houses.No-one wants them,  
 there's little wonder that they are   
 constantly on the move.               </content>
