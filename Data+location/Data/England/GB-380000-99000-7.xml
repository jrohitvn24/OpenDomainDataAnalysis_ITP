		<content> Milton Abbas Church of England        
 Voluntary Controlled First School is  
 an attractive Victorian flint and     
 brick building surrounded by pleasant 
 grounds. There are now 36 children on 
 roll with an extra 7 children due to  
 start school for the first time next  
 Spring.                               
 There are two classes in the School,  
 the Juniors with the Headteacher and  
 the Infants with the second teacher.  
 The children come from Milton Abbas   
 and from nearby villages. Some        
 children at the School previously     
 attended Hilton School until its      
 closure three years ago. A school bus 
 brings children from Lower and Higher 
 Ansty, Melcombe Bingham and Hilton.   
 Children start at the School a little 
 before their fifth birthdays and stay 
 until they are nine years old.
