{CLATWORTHY                            
 On 14 June 1985,a  group of pupils    
 from  Bishop Fox's School visited the 
 village of Clatworthy to carry out a  
 village study. John Thompson wrote    
 down these answers on his village     
 survey sheet :                        
{Brief Description of Village          
 This is a small, fairly typical       
 Somerset village. I would call it a   
 hamlet rather than a village. There is
 a church in a rather ruinous state and
 along the main street is an           
 oddly-shaped house. The house looks as
 if half of it had been chopped off.   
 There are only two shops, a pottery   
 shop for tourists and a small general 
 store for locals. There is not much   
 for young people to do in the         
 evenings.                             </content>
