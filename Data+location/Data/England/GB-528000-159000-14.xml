		<title>14The Fire Service</title>
		<content>   The fire service is run by the      
 Greater London Council. The 144 fire  
 stations in London are divided into 11
 divisions. The brigade costs 115      
 million pounds per year.              
   If there is a fire phone 999 it does
 not cost any money. The control gets  
 in touch with your local station      
 within 30 seconds. Our local station  
 is in the Brighton Road. The fire     
 brigade will be at your house within 5
 minutes.                              
   When a call is received the firemen 
 put on their fire gear as they ride in
 the engine.                           
   There are different appliances. They
 are the water tender, emergency       
 tender, hydraulic platforms, turntable
 ladders etc.                          
   Firemen go to fires, road accidents 
 and to get cats out of trees.
