		<title>03MORTHAM ESTATE</title>
		<content> Mortham Estate is a family trust,     
 consisting of the manors of Rokeby,   
 Mortham and Brignall.  It extends to  
 about 3500 acres and there are twelve 
 separate agricultural tenancies.  In  
 common with all such estates, the type
 of farming has changed.  Mechanisation
 and some degree of specialisation,    
 have meant the number of people       
 working on the farms has decreased.   
 Many cottages, originally for farm    
 workers, have either fallen into decay
 or are used for other purposes.   Many
 farm buildings are no longer suitable 
 for modern machinery.  The typical    
 farm has perhaps three tractors,      
 combine harvester, silage maker, and  
 perhaps two large custom-built        
 buildings fo dairy, grain or food     
 storage and beef rearing. Its 200 or  
 so acres will employ two men.
