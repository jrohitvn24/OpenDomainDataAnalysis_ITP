		<title>10ATTITUDES IN/AROUND CHAGFORD</title>
		<content> As there is such a cross-section of   
 types of people in and around Chagford
 attitudes to topical events show a    
 wide range.  One of the most discussed
 local points of interest is that of   
 the{traffic}situation in Chagford.    
 Drivers of coaches, buses and lorries 
 have difficulty sometimes with the    
 narrowness of the lanes and streets.  
 This is compounded by the fact that   
 street parking is allowed but the     
 introduction of 'yellow lines' has so 
 far been resisted.  There is a great  
 deal of discussion about the parking  
 problem and the need for a second Car 
 Park.                                 
 Another topic of interest is that of  
 the imbalance of population and the   
 need to try to ensure the continuation
 of the younger element in the commun_ 
 ity.
