		<title>10SCHOOL HISTORY</title>
		<content>  This school was built in 1869        
 replacing one built in 1827.  It is a 
 lovely sandstone building, and we like
 it very much.  The original old doors 
 and roof beams look nice.  We have the
 original plans from the County        
 record office and found that the      
 Infant and Junior rooms used to be    
 cloakrooms.  A village lady           
 remembers 57 yrs. ago when the        
 toilets were earth closets in the     
 garden and the children had to go     
 out in the rain to use them.  We      
 found there used to be fixed          
 benches and raised teachers' desks    
 in the classrooms and that the        
 middle classroom was quite small      
 but later extended.  There were       
 open fireplaces in all the rooms.     
 The children went home for dinner     
 or ate their sandwiches in the
