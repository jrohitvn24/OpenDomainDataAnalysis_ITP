 The{total number of houses is 1890},{ 
{1521}of these are{private}houses and{ 
{369}are{council houses.}Some houses in
 the town are only occupied during the 
 holiday season.                       
 The older houses are mostly in the    
 centre of the town. THe older houses  
 are built of local stone with slate   
 roofs. Newer houses are built of      
 concrete blocks and tiles.            
 For several years no new houses have  
 been built because of a building      
 embargo imposed by the South West     
 Water Authority but with the          
 completion of the sewage works in 1985
 the embargo has been lifted. Three new
 private estates are being built at{   
{Whiterock Orchard, Guineaport,and     
{Polmear Court}. The North Cornwall    
 District Council has just completed a 
 housing scheme at{Southern Way.}      </content>
