feeding,40 calves at the farm and 150  
in the fields.While up the fields I    
look at the crops as we have a problem

heifer is coughing and a 4 month steer 
has a large lump on his hip.The vet can
P.D.I. the milking cow.After breakfast 
I fetch the tractor from Mursley to    
blow the barn of hay we stacked in the 
rain as it has started to heat.Next a  
look at the fat cattle for market to-  
morrow.The Spray Rep. has arrived to   
walk the crops to check for pests.The  
crops look good.If the weather stays   
warm we will start next week so I      
spend the afternoon getting the        
combine ready.7.00 just sit down for   
supper when the phone rings:someone    
has left the gate open on the footpath.
