		<title>03FARMING IN STOKE DOYLE</title>
		<content>   Farming in Stoke Doyle is mainly    
 arable. The main crops are wheat and  
 barley, though sugar-beet, beans and  
 peas and grass are also grown. The    
 fields are planted in rotation. This  
 means that each year a different crop 
 is planted in each field so that the  
 land is not exhausted eg. if last year
 the field grew barley and this year   
 you grew sugar-beet, then next year   
 you would grow grass. The farms also  
 have animals, mainly sheep and cattle.
 In the summer the sheep graze on some 
 of the grass fields. The remainder of 
 the grass is cut and used for silage  
 to feed the animals in the winter.The 
 sugar-beet in the area is supplied to 
 the British Sugar Corporation in      
 Peterborough. Each farmer is given a  
 quota which fixes the amount he grows.
