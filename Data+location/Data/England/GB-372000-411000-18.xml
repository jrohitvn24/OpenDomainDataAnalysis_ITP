		<content>{School Closures:}Harwood Methodist    
 Infant School is to be merged with    
 Hough Fold Juniors and its land       
 sold.Neither the church nor the       
 parents supported the merger.A        
 petition was organised and presented  
 to the Minister of Education,Sir Keith
 Joseph.He agreed with Bolton Education
 Authority that due to the falling     
 birthrate there were too many spare   
 places in Harwood schools.            
{Tipping:}Residents are concerned over 
 the fly-tipping of rubbish along the  
 valleys of Longsight Park.            
{Teachers' Strike:}This has disrupted  
 local schools as much as anywhere     
 else.Many sporting activities have had
 to be cancelled.
