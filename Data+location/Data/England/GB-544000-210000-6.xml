		<content>{                                      
{St. Mary at Latton}is a Norman church 
 on a Saxon site.It was enlarged and   
 changed many times through the        
 centuries.It was mentioned in the     
{first Domesday book.   }              
  At the door there are two gargoyles; 
 people believed that the faces would  
 keep the evil spirits out.            
  To show the history of the church,   
 members have recently made a set of   
 pictorial kneelers.One shows a monk   
 falling off the tower.People say if   
 you run round the church thirteen     
 times ,knock on the door seven times  
 you see him dropping from above.      
 Another kneeler shows Queen Elizabeth 
 First's signature.She visited Latton  
 three times.Another shows the fire    
 that happened in 1960 .               
  Nowadays the church has a service    
 every day and it is full up on Sunday.</content>
