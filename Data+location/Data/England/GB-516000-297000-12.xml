		<content> I went to the museum one afternoon to 
 speak to Martin Howe the curator about
 the Domesday Project. There I found a 
 real character, a rugby player I      
 suspect, whose knowledge of local     
 history left me almost speechless.    
 We stood there in the building which  
 had been built in 1816 as a home for  
 Squire Cook and was later used as a   
 hospital and he spoke with a charming 
 irreverance of the past populations of
 our city. In the Stone Age, it seems  
 there was a thriving market economy   
 centred at Castor with some 10,000    
 clay pots a week being manufactured   
 and distributed. The Romans left      
 behind them the makings of an impor-  
 tant collection but perhaps the most  
 unique is the collection of straw,    
 woodwork, and paper models made by the
 Napoleonic prisoners-of-war during    
 their up to 15 years imprisonment.    </content>
