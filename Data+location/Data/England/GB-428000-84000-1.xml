		<title>01LOOKING AT THE WEST WIGHT</title>
		<content>                                       
  The West Wight is a beautiful area.  
 It is the most westerly point of the  
 diamond shaped island.There is lots of
 countryside.It is the most attractive 
 place on the island.The Warren has    
 lots of rabbits and is a great big    
 grassy area.There are lots of Gorse   
 bushes with big prickles.The Warren   
 has lots of heather bushes and it's   
 very springy.Near the end there is a  
 beautiful view of the Needles         
 lighthouse and Alum Bay.There is an   
 especially nice tea room down at Alum 
 Bay.The area is very beautiful.The    
 beach is stoney but it is most        
 enjoyable for many people of all      
 kinds.It is a very good place for     
 finding crystals and fossils.There are
 231 steps down to the beach and there 
 are very high cliffs.
