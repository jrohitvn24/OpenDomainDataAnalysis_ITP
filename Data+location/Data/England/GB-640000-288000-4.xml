 Beccles is a small market town.There  
are many small shops of different      
kinds-food shops,furniture             
shops,chemists,baker's shops,clothes   
shops and two supermarkets.  The main  
shopping area comprises New Market,The 
Walk,Exchange Square and the           
Â£Gates'-Sheepgate,Blyburgate,Small-    
gate and Hungate.  Some Beccles people 
shop in Lowestoft ,Gt.Yarmouth or      
Norwich as they cannot get everything  
they need in the town shops and there  
is a bigger choice in the larger towns.
 Nevertheless, most people in Beccles  
find that they can do all of their     
normal,everyday shopping in Beccles.
