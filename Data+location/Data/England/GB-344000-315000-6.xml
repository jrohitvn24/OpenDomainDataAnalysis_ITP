		<content>{GREAT BERWICK FARM                    
   One ot the farms visited _ Great    
 Berwick farm _ has an acerage of 214  
 acres and the present farmer said that
 he had lived there for 40 years.Part  
 of this land is taken up with 17 acres
 of barley,22 acres of winter wheat and
 6 acres of fodder beet.The rest of the
 land is grazing for the 160 Fresian   
 dairy cows,milked 3 times each day.As 
 well as the dairy cows,the farmer owns
 a total of 240 heifers and calves.    
   2 cowmen 1 tractor driver and a     
 father &amp; son team work on the farm.The
 buildings looked modern &amp; were        
 probably fairly new.                  
   The farmer could think of no        
 disadvantages to living here.He loves 
 the remarkable views to the Welsh     
 hills and the peace of the            
 countryside.(CONT.page 7)
