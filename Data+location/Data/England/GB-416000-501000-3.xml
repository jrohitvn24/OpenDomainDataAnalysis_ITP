		<content>   We were invited to Colburn to play  
 in a six a side tournament against    
 local schools.The start was delayed   
 because our goalie was late.Our first 
 two games Michael Sydall and Colburn  
 were disappointing draws 0-0.We had   
 two games left we had to win to stay  
 in the competition.We beat Middleton  
 Tyas 5-0 and St. Mary's RC.1-0.We were
 through to the finals but it was      
 getting too dark so we had to play a  
 few weeks later.                      
   In the semi-final against Hipswell  
 the score was 0-0 so we had to play   
 sudden death penalties.We won 1-0.    
   Our final game against Le Cateau    
 ended in a 0-0 draw.We played five    
 minutes extra time each way and scored
 the winning goal.We won cup for the   
 school and each player was given a    
 trophy.                               
   Jason Sheard and Paul Marshall.     </content>
