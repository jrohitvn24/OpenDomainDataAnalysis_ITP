		<content> Although the language in common use is
 English the area has a dialect of its 
 own. The area was once in Lancashire  
 and has only joined the new           
 administrative area of Cumbria since  
 1974.The language of this area        
 reflects the language of various      
 European peoples who inhabited it.    
 Ancient Britons, Celts, Norsemen,     
 Anglo Saxons and Normans have all left
 their mark. The principal village     
 Broughton Mills comes from the Old    
 English 'Broc Tun' meaning the        
 farmstead or hamlet by the stream. The
 'Mills' is a reflection of the several
 water powered mills which existed in  
 these valleys with their ready supply 
 of water. Much of the dialect used    
 locally reflects the agricultural     
 roots of the area. The increasing     
 viewing of television is slowly       
 changing this.                        </content>
