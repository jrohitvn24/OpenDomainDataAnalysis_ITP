In Hartwell we have two kinds of church
-a Methodist Chapel and a C.E.church.  
We also have a parish hall where we    
have a joint Sunday school for 4-7 yr  
olds.The 7-11 yr olds meet together in 
our parish hall.We have quite a lot of 
clubs in the village for younger people
to join.Here is a list of the clubs:   
Boys'Brigade,Girls'Brigade,Brownies &amp;  
Cubs,Girl Guides,Rangers and Scouts and
a Youth Club which meets once a month. 
In Ashton there is the Parish Church &amp; 
similar organisations exist there for  
young people.Both Ashton and Hartwell  
schools are used for activities by PTAs
including discos for their pupils.There
are plans to start a cricket team again
after it and a football club folded by 
lack of support in Hartwell.Ashton's   
rugby and cricket club have youth teams
which are strong. Rachel Husbands,11   </content>
