		<title>18   THE LOCAL FARRIER.</title>
		<content> Gerry Aslett has been working as a    
 farrier for 30 years.He travels around
 the area in a blue van,with a{portable
{gas_fired forge}shoeing about 9 horses
 a day.He is the only local farrier    
 although there used to be a blacksmith
 who repaired farm implements too.     
        His day begins at 7am.preparing
 horseshoes in his forge at home,&amp; ends
 about 7pm. Mr. Aslett came to our     
 school one afternoon to shoe Bumble,  
 the family palomino pony. She needed 2
 new front shoes &amp; just a trim on the  
 back hooves as she does little road   
 walking.The shoes are made of mild    
 steel &amp; the nails are from Sweden.The 
{London_Fishguard coach}road once made 
 the area an important one for horses. 
 Fresh ones were brought from          
 Stokenchurch to the top of Dashwood   
 Hill,very near Mr.Aslett's present    
 home.                                 </content>
