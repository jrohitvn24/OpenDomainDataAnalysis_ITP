		<title>11SPAINS HALL, FINCHINGFIELD.</title>
		<content> This brief history of the estate at   
 Spains Hall begins with the Domesday  
 Survey of 1O86.After the Norman       
 Conquest it belonged to Hervy de      
 Ispania.The original Norman house     
 was succeeded  by a moated            
 timber-framed house parts of which are
 still extant.The present house was    
 largely built in 1585 by William      
 Kempe.In 176O the estate was purchased
 from his descendant Lady Swinnerton   
 Dyer by Samuel Ruggles a clothier from
 Bocking, Essex.A later Ruggles,Thomas,
 married Anne Brise. Thus, only three  
 families, de Ispania,Kempe and Ruggles
 Brise have lived in Spains Hall since 
 the eleventh century an interesting   
 example of continuity in English      
 country life.                         
 Today the house remains the most      
 important in the area.That is why it  
 is in this Domesday survey of 1985.   </content>
