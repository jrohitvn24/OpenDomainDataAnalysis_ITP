		<content> Farms are small by lowland standards, 
 being anything from 50 - 100 acres. In
 addition to meadow and pasture most   
 farms have sheep stints on the fell.  
 Sheep are mostly Swaledale. Half bred 
 lambs are produced by a Leicester     
 cross and these, together with Swale- 
 dale tups,wethers and surplus gimmer  
 lambs are sold at Auction Marts at Tow
 Law and St.John's Chapel.  Older ewes 
 which can continue to breed for a year
 or two longer in a milder climate are 
 also sold. The highest price paid for 
 a tup sold at St.John's Chapel this   
 year was Â£4000. The sheep are clipped 
 in July and the wool sold to the Wool 
 Marketing Board. On some farms large  
 modern barns built of breeze blocks   
 and corrugated sheeting are used for  
 lambing, wintering stock and storing  
 machinery.
