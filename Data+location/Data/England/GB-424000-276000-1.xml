		<title>01COUNTRYSIDE AROUND TILE HILL</title>
		<content> About 3/4 of the land enclosed in the 
 grid reference 04240276 is farmland,  
 mainly grazing. A busy railway line   
 crosses the middle of this area, east 
 to west, passing through two small    
 stations, Tile hill and Berkswell.    
 Down the eastern side of the area it  
 is mainly residential with Tile Hill  
 Village being in the middle of this   
 part. In the south western corner is  
 the edge of Balsall Common which is   
 also residential. There are three     
 schools included - one a              
 co-educational comprehensive (Heart of
 England), one a single sex            
 comprehensive (Tile Hill Wood Girls)  
 and a small primary school (Leigh     
 Church of England). One large         
 engineering works has reduced in size 
 in recent years and another disused   
 warehouse is now a Sports Centre for  
 the Disabled.                         </content>
