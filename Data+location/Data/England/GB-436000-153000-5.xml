		<title>05GEOLOGY-THE BOURNE VALLEY</title>
		<content> The area is mostly hilly but with two 
 beautiful valleys running through it. 
 The hills are made of{limestone}and   
 contain fossils. A good time to find  
 these is in winter when the land has  
 been ploughed. Most of the fossils are
 of sea urchins and are known locally  
 as "Shepherd's Crowns", "Sheep's      
 Hearts" and "Potato Fish".            
 There are also flints in the{limestone
 and in the last century these were    
 napped and used by builders. The      
 Church and many of the cottages are   
 built of flint and bricks.            
 There is a{clay}capping to the hill   
 tops which was forced to the surface{ 
 during the Cretaceous Period leaving  
 hillsides of newly formed chalk.      
 The clay was used to make bricks,     
 which were fired locally and have     
 become a feature of the local barns.
