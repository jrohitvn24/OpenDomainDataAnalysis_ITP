		<content> Pheasants, both species of partridge, 
 wood pigeons, lapwings, starlings,    
 linnets and yellowhammers are common  
 on the arable land. Regular summer    
 breeders are cuckoos, turtle doves and
 yellow wagtails. Flocks of fieldfares 
 and redwings overwinter on the fields.
 Green and spotted woodpeckers,        
 magpies, tree creepers, as well as    
 great, blue and long-tailed tits occur
 in trees and hedges.                  
                                       
 The kestrel is the commonest diurnal  
 raptor; tawny owls, the most          
 frequently heard at night, though     
 short-eared, little and barn owls     
 occur.                                
                                       
 These species are typical of the fen; 
 the common garden species, as well as 
 swallows, swifts and house martins,   
 are also present.                     </content>
