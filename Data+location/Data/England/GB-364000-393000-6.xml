		<title>06Crime Prevention in Culcheth</title>
		<content>    We try to stop crime in Culcheth in
 a number of ways.  One is called      
 'Homewatch'.  In a Homewatch area     
 people ask their neighbours to keep   
 watch on their home when they are out.
 If anybody sees something suspicious  
 they call the Police in.  There are   
 Homewatch areas all over the country, 
 helping to reduce the number of       
 burglaries.                           
    Cycle coding is another means of   
 crime prevention.  It has been done   
 outside the CPS supermarket in        
 Culcheth.  The Police stamp your post 
 code into the metal of your bicycle   
 frame.  You then get a sticker with   
 'Coded Cycle' written on.  This goes  
 on your bike to discourage thieves    
 from taking it.
