		<title>16SURVEY ON TRANSPORT,CHEADLE.</title>
		<content>    WE CARRIED OUT A SURVEY AMONGST THE
 CHILDREN IN OUR CLASS CONCERNING      
 TRANSPORT. ALTHOUGH THERE ARE FREQUENT
 BUS SERVICES ALONG ALL THE MAJOR ROADS
 WITH SHORT DISTANCES BETWEEN STOPS,   
 NOT ONE OF THE SERVICES TRAVELS INTO  
 THE HOUSING AREAS. MOST OF THE        
 FAMILIES HAVE AT LEAST ONE CAR, BUT   
 FOR THOSE WITHOUT THEIR OWN VEHICLES  
 THE LACK OF PUBLIC TRANSPORT CAN CAUSE
 HARDSHIP. THIS IS PARTICULALY SO FOR  
 THE HANDICAPPED AND THE OLDER         
 RESIDENTS WHO ARE RELIANT UPON THE    
 GOOD WILL OF OTHERS. THE FEELING OF   
 ISOLATION WHICH SOME PEOPLE SEEM TO   
 FEEL IS AGGRAVATED BY THE LACK OF     
 REASONABLY PRICED TAXIES IN THE       
 DISTRICT.                             
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
