		<title>10A New Estate in Harvington.</title>
		<content> Harvington is an old village with     
 lots of old houses.There are several  
 new estates and a further one has just
 been completed. My Mum is a sales     
 woman selling the new houses.         
 Charter Homes first opened last year. 
 Before a house is built it has to be  
 planned. You get pieces of wood called
 pegs and these mark out the houses.   
 The inside takes longer than the      
 outside .I live in one of the houses. 
 They are really nice except when the  
 radiators are cold and not working.   
 There are three types  of houses, the 
 Charlecote,Arden and the Marlborough. 
 She has just sold the last one.Last   
 year my class did a project based on  
 the building site at Charter Homes.We 
 visited the houses as they were all   
 being built  and we went around the   
 show house. We talked to the builders 
 about their work.It was great fun.    </content>
