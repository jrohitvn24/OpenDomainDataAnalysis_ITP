		<title>05Farming 2: Sheep Farming</title>
		<content> Swaledale sheep are the main breed,   
 kept pure and heafed on the commons   
 and fells. There are two Herdwick     
 flocks. Each farm has an ear and smit 
 mark; there is a "Shepherds' Guide" to
 help identify stray sheep. Hoggs are  
 wintered on lowland farms. "Inside"   
 ewes are mated in November with       
 Blue-faced Leicester rams to produce  
 cross lambs called Mules in March/    
 April. These are sold at 5 months fat 
 or for breeding. Farmers still help   
 each other on clipping days when the  
 sheep are sheared by machine. October 
 is a busy month for selling lambs and 
 for buying replacement ewes and rams. 
 All farms have a working sheep dog,   
 and the younger farmers gather sheep  
 from the fell by motor-cycle. Sheep   
 have, by law to be dipped twice a year
 to prevent the spread of sheep scab.
