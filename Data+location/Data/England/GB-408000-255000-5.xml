		<title>05Malt Mill Lane Resident</title>
		<content>        Until 1972 the Tudor and       
 Victorian buildings  in Malt Mill lane
 were derelict and in ruins. People    
 moved out of them after the second    
 world war.                            
           In 1972 they were restored  
 and modernised and now form part of a 
 sheltered housing scheme for the      
 elderly.The area won an award for     
 design.                               
           The people who live  there  
 come from all over the country but a  
 few come from Alcester.All agreed the 
 scheme was excellent with its resident
 wardens. "No one need be lonely", one 
 old lady said but added "I miss my    
 garden  to hang out the washing".MRS  
 Tanner,an Alcester resident for 67    
 years thought Alcester had changed for
 the worse ."All the little shops have 
 gone and crime has increased.I much   
 prefer life in the thirties.          </content>
