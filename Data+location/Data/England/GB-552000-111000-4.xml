   The area around Chiddingly is rural 
and there is no large town in the      
vicinity. In the village itself there  
is one public house,a church and a     
shop. When people want to go out for   
an evening they either go to the pub   
for a drink or they will go into       
Hailsham to a restaurant. If they want 
to see a movie however,they must go    
into Brighton or Eastbourne.           
 There is a cricket field in the       
village and matches are played by the  
local club against other teams on      
Sunday afternoons. There are no other  
sports facilities and to play squash   
or tennis the people go to the sports  
centre in Hailsham.
