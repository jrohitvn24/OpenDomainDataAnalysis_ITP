		<content> My Dad has a small number of fields.In
 these he grows hay.He cuts it late in 
 the summer then visits farmers to sell
 it to them.If they want to buy it he  
 delivers it to them.Because this only 
 takes a small part of his time and    
 does not make a lot of money he also  
 works on Ernie Diamonds farm.He does  
 all sorts of things,driving           
 tractors,looking after animals,mending
 hedges and fences and planting crops. 
 When it is harvest time he has to get 
 up before I am awake and he gets home 
 after I have gone to sleep.He works   
 very hard.
