		<content> Gypsies have traditionally stayed for 
 periods of a few weeks on areas of    
 open land within this D-block.In June 
 1985 there were six caravans on rough 
 ground beside the B3013.              
                                       
     Over the last twenty years, there 
 has been a decrease in available sites
 because land is being used more       
 intensively.This has caused more      
 pressure on remaining sites.The county
 council is being asked by gypsies and 
 local residents to provide permanent  
 sites for travelling people.One such  
 site is due to open soon nearby.There 
 will be concrete bases,water,drainage.
                                       
     Where up to thirty caravans have  
 congregated for months recently,along 
 the A30,there are now mounds up to two
 metres high,to prevent further access.
