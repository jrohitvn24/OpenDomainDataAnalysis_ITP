 into their shop to buy drink,food

 baked beans.Their most expensive item 
 is a bottle of Gin the lowest price is
 a box of matches at 6p.They get their 
 stock every day but on Wednesday they 
 get a big stock.10 people sometimes   
 try and get in at closing time at     
 about 7.00 and on Fridays they close  
 at 9.00.They send their Mattersons and
 pork pies and things like that back   
 when the dates are out and changes    
 them for fresh.The stale bread they   
 give to the boy over the road or they 
 throw it away.They sometimes run out
