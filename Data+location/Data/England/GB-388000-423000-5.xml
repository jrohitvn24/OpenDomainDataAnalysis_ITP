		<title>05Industries at Todmorden Moor</title>
		<content> Very few industries remain in the     
 area. There has in the past been some 
{stone quarrying}and{coal mining}but   
 this has declined and only exists in a
 very limited way now. There has also  
 been in the past a{pipe works}on the  
 Bacup Road side of the moor utilising 
 local clay but this has now closed and
 all that is left is a largely derelict
 site occupied in part by a{maggot     
{farm.}On the Burnley Road side of the 
 moor there are several old woollen and
 cotton mills which have long since    
 closed and come back into limited use 
 as small units for local firms. The   
 major remaining industries are{       
{Turn Leathers,}    Leather Clothes:   
{N&amp;R Contractors,}  Demolition:        
{Norman Jowett,}    Haulage &amp; Storage: 
{James H Sutcliffe,}Home Furniture:    
{Alan Cooper,}      Office Furniture   
 and various smaller, local businesses.</content>
