		<title>19Badgers.</title>
		<content> In the woods around{Colburn}there are 
 badgers.Late one night, I went down   
 with a local badger expert.As we      
 approached, we had to keep very quiet 
 because badgers can hear very well.The
 badgers{sett}is near to the front of  
 the path at the foot of a tree, but   
 you can't see it unless you know what 
 you are looking for.You should look   
 for{tracks}of the badger in the mud,  
 or for{paths}that go under bushes.    
 Eventually a badger's black and white 
 head popped up, then it went back into
 the sett and came out with three{cubs.
 They started to play around the paths 
 they had made, then a boy who was     
 with us took a flash photograph.The   
 badger didn't mind that, but when he  
 took two, one after the other, the    
 badgers did not reappear .
