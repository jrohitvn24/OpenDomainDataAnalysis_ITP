 At the bottom of Basin Lane stands the
Reliant factory which was built fifty  
years ago in 1935. They do not make the
whole car in Basin Lane just the {fibre
glass bodies}. The main factory is on  
the Watling Street between Two Gates   
and Fazeley. Five hundred people work  
for Reliant one hundred and fifty work 
at Basin Lane.                         
 {The cars} Reliant make are the Rialto
costing three thousand pounds, the     
Scimiar twelve thousand pounds, the Fox
and the new SS1. As well as making car 
bodies the factory produces battery    
cases, moulds for taxi bodies and      
walkways for chemical factories. They  
produce eight cars a day. The car      
bodies are made of fibre glass and     
resin. They use hot presses which reach
150 degrees Celsius.
