		<content> The parents of the school were asked  
 to fill in a questionnaire about where
 they were born and how long they had  
 lived on Westlands estate.  Out of 192
 replies, only 16 Dads and 16 Mums were
 born in Droitwich. Although the estate
 was mainly planned as a Birmingham    
 overspill development, less than      
 one-third of the current parent       
 population of the school were actually
 born in Birmingham.                   
 Parents were also asked about their   
 place of work. Out of 157 replies, 96 
 Dads were unemployed. There were more 
 replies from Mums.  Out of 197        
 replies, 100 worked in Droitwich and  
 87 did not have a job.  Most Dads went
 to work by car.                       
 More than two-thirds of the replies   
 own a car; one-quarter have more than 
 one television set and a third have a 
 video.                                </content>
