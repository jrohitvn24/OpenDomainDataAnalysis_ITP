		<title>08LOCAL AMENITIES</title>
		<content> I interviewed several people about    
 their views on the amenities in and   
 around Ruislip.The responses showed   
 that the facilities are thought to be 
 fairly adequate.One person commented, 
 however,that most of the amenities are
 for teenagers,leaving the middle-aged 
 people with clubs,a leisure centre    
 and swimming pool.The Elderly are     
 reasonably well catered for,having day
 centres,homes and various assorted    
 clubs.Additional amenities suggested  
 were:a local cinema,a citizens advice 
 bureau and more non-sponsored youth   
 clubs.Views on the cuts were that     
 opportunities had been cut for mainly 
 young people,and things like reduced  
 grass mowing,for example,meant that   
 children play ball in the streets     
 causing danger.The loss of amenities  
 would encourage vandalism, which would
 affect the community as a whole.      </content>
