		<title>03 GREEN FARM, ROCKHAMPTON</title>
		<content>Green Farm is run by Mr.&amp; Mrs.Childs   
and one of their 4 sons.It is a 75 acre
farm rented from a local landowner.It  
now concentrates solely on dairying but
it used to keep sheep and grow wheat.  
There are 40 dairy cows and 25         
followers.Mr.Childs also keeps some    
chickens and sells the eggs to a local 
health food shop.The farm concentrates 
on dairying because the land is only a 
few metres above sea level and there is
a high water table.The EEC milk quotas 
have not affected the farm because they
produce less than 200,000 litres per   
annum.However they were affected last  
year.Modern mechanisation has reduced  
numbers working in agriculture.        
Alternative employment has to be found 
such as the local nuclear power        
stations.The busiest time of the year  
is summer when haymaking takes place.  
Grass is also cut for silage and used  </content>
