		<title>12HOUSING IN SOUTH GODSTONE</title>
		<content>   This area is mainly farmland with   
 scattered farmhouses and cottages. The
 development of the village of South   
 Godstone shows two main growth times; 
 the mid 1850s with the coming of the  
 railway, and the mid 1950s with the   
 increase in road transport( mostly    
 private cars).                        
   There are terraced, semi-detached   
 and detached houses, and a few late   
 Victorian and Edwardian Country houses
 on the outskirts of the village. Two  
 small blocks of flats are found in    
 Easter Way.                           
   The usual building material is brick
 with tiled roofs; the walls are       
 sometimes rendered and colour-washed. 
   Central heating, wall insulation and
 double-glazing to increase and        
 regulate the warmth indoors, are      
 increasingly to be found. Fireplaces  
 and chimneys are of little importance.</content>
