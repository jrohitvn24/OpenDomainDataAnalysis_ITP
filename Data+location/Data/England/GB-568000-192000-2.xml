		<content> Comparing the communities in our'D'   
 block Great Burstead and Ramsden      
 Bellhouse are very similar.South      
 Green and Sunnymede both have large   
 housing developments.In Crays Hill and
 Sunnymede older,cheap holiday         
 bungalows with large plots are being  
 bought by speculators.The old building
 is knocked down and a new executive _ 
 type house is built in its place.South
 Green is the only community with a    
 doctor's surgery,probably because it  
 is one of the largest areas.Crays Hill
 cannot be classified with any other   
 region but shares many characteristics
 of the other areas.The shops in the   
 communities are usually used for      
 convenience shopping and tend to be   
 small.Specialist shops andfree car_   
 parking attract shoppers from outside 
 the area.Weekend shopping is done     
 elsewhere,in large stores in Basildon.</content>
