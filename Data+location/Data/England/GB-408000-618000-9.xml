		<title>09Farm Accomodation.</title>
		<content>  There are several types of farm      
 accommodation in the area ranging from
 the large{"Halls",}homes of the estate
 owners, to the small{cottages}often   
 occupied by farm-workers. There are   
 two halls on our survey, one at       
 Harehope and the other, where Oliver  
 Cromwell once stayed, at Eglingham.   
 Both are partially let in flats. There
 are also several{farm houses}affording
 normal family accomodation. Most      
 farm-workers live in the cottages     
 grouped on the estates; none own their
 own homes in our particular region.   
  One of the cottages, once the home of
 a coffin-maker, has no electricity!   
 There is no mains gas in the area     
 although the pipe-line from the North 
 Sea runs through Beanley! Automation  
 has reduced the number of farm workers
 and so several cottages are now let to
 non-farm workers or as{"holiday homes"</content>
