		<content>{DAUGHTER'S DAY }                      
 IN THE MORNING I WAKE UP AT 7:00 A.M. 
 WHEN MY ALARM CLOCK PIPS IT'S NOISE.I 
 USUALLY JUMP OUT OF BED:PANTS ON,VEST 
 ON,SOCKS ON,DRESS AND JUMPER.MY MOTHER
 SAYS I MUST BE IN THE KITCHEN BY 7:15.
 FOR BREAKFAST IT'S MOSTLY FARMHOUSE   
 BRAN WITH MILK.I EAT IT QUICKLY.THEN  
 THERE'S TOAST WITH MELTED BUTTER      
 DRIBBLING DOWN THE SIDE.IT'S 7:55-NOW 
 I MUST HURRY:CLEAN MY TEETH,BRUSH HAIR
 INTO MY BLAZER.I PICK UP MY BAG AND   
 RUSH TO THE CAR.WE DRIVE TO SCHOOL    
 PICKING UP ANOTHER CHILD ON THE WAY.AT
 SCHOOL I FALL ONTO THE QUAD,SAY       
 GOOD-BYE TO MY MOTHER,RUSH TO HANG UP 
 MY BLAZER AND ON TO JOIN THE ASSEMBLY 
 QUEUE.AFTER ASSEMBLY WE'RE OFF TO OUR 
 FIRST LESSON.                         
 IF IT'S SATURDAY IT'S MATHS-SO BORING 
 THAT I'M PLEASED WHEN IT'S OVER.      
 SCRIPTURE FOLLOWS AND I'M INTERESTED  </content>
