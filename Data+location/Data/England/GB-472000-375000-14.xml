		<content>  After the age of 16 the young people 
 of this area can either contine into  
 further education or find employment, 
 which is very difficult at this time. 
 This is done by staying on into the   
 sixth form of their secondary school  
 or by going onto the North Notts      
 College of Further Education in       
 Worksop,to follow courses of study    
 leading to A levels or other          
 qualifications.                       
 They then start work or go onto       
 University,Polytechnic College or     
 Teacher Training College.             
  The private sector is well catered   
 for by the nearby Worksop College and 
 Trent College.                        
  Ample provision is made locally in   
 both Retford and Worksop for any      
 mildly or seriously handicapped       
 children.
