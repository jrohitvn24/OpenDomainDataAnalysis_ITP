		<title>10The Parish Church,Sellindge</title>
		<content> The present Parish Church of Sellindge
 stands on the main A20 road at the    
 west end of the village opposite the  
 junction with Stone Hill.Also known as
 the church of St.Mary the Virgin.It   
 dates from about 1100,but the original
 Domesday Book records there being 2   
 churches.It is very likely that a     
 Saxon church stood on this site and   
 part of the external South wall could 
 date from this period.Various         
 modifications were made up to 1850    
 giving the present church which is    
 about 90ft by 40ft including the tower
 and vestry.Much of the stained glass  
 was damaged by bombs in 1940,but the  
 bells survived,the oldest cast in     
 1723.The church comes within the      
 Canterbury Diocese and the present    
 (1985) Vicar is Rev.P.Goodsell,whose  
 Parish also includes Lympne and       
 Stowting.                             </content>
