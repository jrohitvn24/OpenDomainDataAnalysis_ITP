		<content> The area is an undulating panorama of 
 arable and pasture land bisected by   
 hedgerows, presenting an ever-varying 
 landscape through the seasons.  The   
 old pasture still reveals the ridge   
 and furrow from medieval times.  The  
 ground rises steeply from the River   
 Welland valley in the south to Nevill 
 Holt in the north and Bringhurst in   
 the west.  The trees are a mixture of 
 horsechestnut, oak, lime, ash, fir and
 beech with a greater concentration    
 around the villages except for the odd
 spinney and Holt Wood.  The avenue of 
 horsechestnuts leading up to Nevill   
 Holt is particularly striking.  The   
 houses, concentrated in the villages, 
 are a pleasant mixture of natural     
 stone and old red brick, roofed with  
 slates with the occasional thatched   
 roof and colour washed wall.  Most    
 modern houses are suitably blended.   </content>
