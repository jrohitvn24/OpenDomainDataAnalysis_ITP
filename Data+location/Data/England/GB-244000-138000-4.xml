		<title>04What the houses are made of</title>
		<content>  Some of the older houses in our area 
 are made of cob which is a mix of     
 straw mud and dung. Cob houses need a 
 thatched roof with a very wide brim   
 covering some of the house and it     
 needs a wide strip at the bottom of   
 tar. People made cob houses in the    
 olden days because it was the only    
 materials they had. At the same time  
 but in a different area we had stone. 
 (Our school is made of stone.) other  
 materials for building a house is     
 brick which is usually cemented over  
 the top then painted. Another material
 is breeze block which is only about 50
 years old.
