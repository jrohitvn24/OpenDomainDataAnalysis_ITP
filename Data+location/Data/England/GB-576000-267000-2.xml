        Quite a large proportion of    
this block is covered by this Heath.   
Heathland it is no longer.During the   
39-45 war the subsidy paid by the      
Ministry of Agriculture made it        
eminently worthwhile to plough up      
hitherto worthless heathland that had  
long been considered unworthy of       
intensive agriculture.                 
        People of the village remember 
playing at weekends or in the evenings 
on the Heath in prewar days. It was    
poor soil at the surface levels and was
covered by gorse,broom and brambles.   
Rabbits abounded and actually catching 
them on the Heath used to form part of 
a regular diet,not only to supplement  
wartime rations but also to help out   
with meagre wage packets.
