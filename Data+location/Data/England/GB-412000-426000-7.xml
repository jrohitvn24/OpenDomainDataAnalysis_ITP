		<title>07LOCAL DOCTOR'S PRACTICE,WYKE</title>
		<content>   Our local G.P. was twenty-six when  
 he began his career as a doctor.      
   The worst cases which he has to deal
 with are road accidents.              
   Much of his daily work is concerned 
 with minor complaints such as colds,  
 aches and pains.                      
   Ante-natal care is an important part
 of his job, and in this he co-operates
 closely with the local hospitals and  
 midwives.                             
   At 8.30am. his surgery starts.  The 
 surgery closes at 1pm. and re-opens at
 2pm. for ante-natal and baby          
 clinics.The doctor makes house calls  
 on patients too elderly or ill to     
 visit the surgery.  He also delivers  
 blood samples to the hospital at the  
 end of his day.                       
   Our doctor operates as a member of a
 team of doctors who share the workload
 within the practice.                  </content>
