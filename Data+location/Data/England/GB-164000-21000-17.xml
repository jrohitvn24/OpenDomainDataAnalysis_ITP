		<title>17HEALTH IN CURY/GUNWALLOE</title>
		<content>      There are no Doctors or Dentists 
 Surgeries in the Cury or Gunwalloe    
 area. The nearest surgeries are at    
 Mullion where there is a Clinic       
 staffed by four doctors and four      
 nurses. The majority of people who    
 live in the area belong to the above  
 Health Centre. There is a Family      
 Planning Clinic run by the Doctors and
 nursing staff. Three of the nurses act
 as District Nurses in the area, also  
 the doctors visit those unable to     
 come to the surgery. The general      
 health of the people in the area is   
 comparatively good. There are a number
 of retired people living in the area  
 which does place a slight burden on   
 the Social and Medical services. The  
 low density of population in the area 
 is a factor in the relatively healthy 
 people in the area; another is their  
 occupations, i.e. farming.            </content>
