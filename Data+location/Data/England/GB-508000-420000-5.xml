		<title>05BLOSSOM IN GOXHILL.</title>
		<content> The approaches to the village are     
 famous for their flowering cherry     
 trees which are in blossom in late    
 May. Thornton Road is lined on each   
 side with white flowering trees whilst
 the trees lining Ferry Road are       
 alternately white and pink blossomed. 
 All these trees are mature and hence  
 for the short time that they are in   
 flower the approaches to Goxhill are  
 very picturesque. The ground beheath  
 the trees becomes a carpet of white as
 the blossom falls.                    
                                       
                                       
                                       
 An avenue of elm trees lined Barrow   
 Road from the parish boundary to the  
 outskirts of the village but these,   
 and those in Gatehouse Road, were     
 felled in 1984 when they were ravaged 
 by Dutch Elm Disease.                 </content>
