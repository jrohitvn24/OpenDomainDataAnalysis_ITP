		<title>08A LOCAL FARM</title>
		<content>    We went to a local farm to ask     
 about their land.We drove down a short
 track into the farmyard,which was     
 paved with small stones.When we       
 knocked on the door of the farmhouse  
 an elderly lady answered.The room     
 behind her was dark,there was no      
 carpet on the blue-brick floor.       
    The farmer's wife showed us to the 
 farmer,after looking for a wandering  
 muscovy duck.The farmer was wearing   
 three hats,several jackets and an     
 apron made of a sack.He led us to the 
 cowshed,where eight cows were eating  
 hay.After getting a clean bucket and  
 three-legged stool,he sat down to milk
 his cow by hand.                      
    The farm has been split by a       
 motorway and is now 52 acres of fairly
 rich pasture.We were very surprised by
 old fashioned it all seemed.
