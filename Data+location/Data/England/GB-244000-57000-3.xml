		<title>03OUR CHURCH</title>
		<content> My church is called Saint Pancras     
 church. It is a nice church and I go  
 to Sunday school with my brother while
 my mum and dad go to church.          
                                       
 The church is very old and was built  
 in the 16th century and then rebuilt  
 in the 18th century. One year ago it  
 had an extention built and we call it 
 the lounge. Here are some of the      
 things that happen at our church:     
 Scouts,Brownies,Guides, a playschool, 
 a coffee bar which is for teenagers,  
 which is a youth club also. My mummy  
 helps to run it.                      
                                       
 The church is for anyone who wants to 
 come along.We go to church because we 
 believe in Jesus and my family are    
 Christians.
