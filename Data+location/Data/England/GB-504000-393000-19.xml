		<title>19CLUBS OWERSBY WMNS INSTITUTE</title>
		<content> The Owersby and Osgodby WI has 21 mem-
 bers,4 from Owersby and 17 from Osgod-
 by.We meet every month.The first part 
 of the evening is spent on WI business
 Then we welcome our speaker,who could 
 talk about anything from growing orch-
 ids or icing cakes to hypnotherapy or 
 self-defence.There is always a compet-
 ition,usually related to the subject  
 of the evening and each month the best
 flower brought from members gardens is
 judged.We have provided teas at the   
 local hort.show and other local events
 and entered items in the Lincs.show.We
 also meet members from other WIs at   
 their own meetings or outings and at  
 group meetings such as fashion shows  
 and the annual carol service.One of   
 our group is a VCO.Two ladies have    
 been to Denman College on a walking   
 weekend.Aged 20+ to 70+ we all enjoy  
 our Womens Institute meetings.        </content>
