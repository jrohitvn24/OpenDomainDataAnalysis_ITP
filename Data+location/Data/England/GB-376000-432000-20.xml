		<title>20SHOP SURVEY, PADIHAM.</title>
		<content> Padiham shops mainly line the A671 for
 about a mile.  There are 147 shops or 
 business premises by the roadside.    
 The shops can be grouped in 52        
 different categories, ranging from    
 grocers and florists to banks and     
 second hand shops.  The largest of    
 these groups is that of empty shops,  
 which amount to 10% of all premises.  
 It is likely that this reflects an    
 increase in car ownership, as people  
 travel further for lower prices and a 
 wider range of goods, and the high    
 rate of unemployment in the area.     
                                       
 Of shops actually trading, the most   
 common are second-hand shops and      
 take-away, hot food shops.  There are 
 15 types of food shop, making up 33%  
 of the total number of shops.
