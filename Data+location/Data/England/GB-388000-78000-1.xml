		<content> This block includes some of the       
 beautiful Purbeck coastline and about 
 one third of the block is occupied by 
 the English Channel.  Of the land, the
 western portion (squares 1 (including 
 the deserted village of Tyneham),     
 2,5,6 the Western Half of squares 3   
 and 7) is within the Army Gunnery     
 Ranges and is uninhabited.  Kimmeridge
 Village occupies much of square 8,    
 it's 30 houses and one shop/post      
 office/restaurant being occupied by   
 retired people; local farm workers and
 fisherman; and others who commute to  
 work in roughly equal portions.  The  
 whole block outside the army range is 
 owned by the Smedmore Estate and most 
 houses are rented or leased.  In      
 square 7, on top of the anticline,    
 near the cliff, is an oil well which  
 has produced oil for B.P. for 23      
 years.  The oil is tankered.          </content>
