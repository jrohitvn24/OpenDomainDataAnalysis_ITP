		<content> The block is at the eastern edge of   
 the Forestry Commission's Thetford    
 Forest.  Small wooded areas and tree  
 lined hedgerows are prominent.  The   
 land is devoted to agriculture, with  
 grain, rootcrops and some livestock.  
 It is the main source of employment   
 others being with the Forestry        
 Commission and Thetford industry.  The
 population is otherwise scattered.    
 Recent residential development has    
 taken place in East Harling, but its  
 most spectacular and interesting      
 building remains the Church.  West    
 Harling church is seldom used.        
 Children attend the Harling Infant and
 Junior schools, before progressing to 
 Old Buckenham High School at age 11.  
 East Harling Old School Hall is the   
 recreational centre, whislt sporting  
 interest are based on the Recreational
 Ground.                               </content>
