		<title>10TRAFFIC PROBLEMS IN KIRKBY</title>
		<content> Most residents agree that it is very  
{pleasant}to live in this area because 
 of the{countryside}and slow way of    
 life which many feel has changed      
 little in recent years.Traffic,       
 however,has become very much a        
 problem,especially on Thursday which  
 is{market day,}when stalls are erected
 in the market square.While{traders    
 welcome the influx of local people and
{tourists,}the existing car parks are  
 unable to cope.The town was built long
 before cars and lorries and is more   
 suited to horse and cart.{Congestion  
 is common in{Main St.}and attempts to 
 keep the traffic moving with various  
{parking restrictions,}only serve to   
 anger residents who can be fined for  
 leaving cars outside their own houses.
 A total ban on cars in the centre or  
 some kind of{one-way system}may be the
 solution.                             </content>
