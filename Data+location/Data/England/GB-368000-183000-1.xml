		<title>01THE AREA OF NORTH YATE</title>
		<content> The rectangle of land which we are    
 calling "North Yate" is about ten     
 miles north-east of Bristol.It        
 consists largely of fields and        
 farmland.The south-western corner     
 includes some of the village of Iron  
 Acton,and the northern part takes in  
 part of Rangeworthy.In the south-     
 eastern part there are new housing    
 developments.Running from south to    
 north through the centre of the       
 rectangle is the mainly residential   
 North Road,and there are houses dotted
 around in the country lanes.The land  
 is fairly flat and featureless.       
 Although it is a country area,with    
 schools,pubs,and shops sharing the    
 role as centres of village life,it is 
 impossible to ignore the proximity of 
 the town of Yate.Yate has a population
 of 30,000,the majority of whom live in
 houses built in the last decade or so.</content>
