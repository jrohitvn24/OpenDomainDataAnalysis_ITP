 There is little employment within the 
 area.Market gardening is the main     
 occupation,employing only a few       
 individuals mainly on a seasonal      
 basis.Farms provide some permanent    
 jobs and casual labour during pea     
 picking,fruit picking etc.A large     
 proportion of the population are      
 retired and the majority of the       
 remainder commute to neighbouring     
 towns and to Birmingham.They include  
 professional people,workers in        
 industry,agriculture,shops and the    
 building trade.A few are self-employed
 offering services including painting  
 and decorating,plumbing and electrical
 contracting.Unemployment is not a     
 serious problem.                      </content>
