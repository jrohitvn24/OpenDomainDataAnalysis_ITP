		<title>09       Our May Fair</title>
		<content>    The{May Fair}is a{custom}to        
 celebrate the coming of summer. We had
 a{coutry dancing}display for our      
 parents. There was a May Queen to open
 the May Fair and help pick the winners
 of the raffles.                       
    There was an inflatable castle.    
 There were hot dogs and coca cola to  
 eat and drink. A hot dog is a roll    
 with a sausage in it.                 
    We had a make up{stall}which sold  
 lipstick and blusher that makes your  
 cheeks red and perfume that makes you 
 smell nice. There was a decorated     
 bicyle competition and my friend won  
 it. We had a board with holes in it   
 and you had to throw the bean bags to 
 get the highest score. There was a    
 game where you chose some names for a 
 toy clown and the queen picked a name 
 out of a tin and the person who picked
 the right name won the toy clown.     </content>
