		<title>10WETHERBY PLANNING SYSTEM</title>
		<content>  The West Yorkshire Structure Plan    
 lays down general guidelines for the  
 planning of the whole of the local    
 region. The Wetherby District Plan,   
 produced by the Leeds City Council    
 provides a more detailed plan for the 
 area. In drawing up the local Plan the
 Planning Committee has to consult with
 interested parties and the general    
 public. The Planning Officer decides  
 which land in an area is for housing  
 and other needs. A builder has to     
 obtain planning permission by sending 
 plans to the Development Control      
 Planning Officer who checks that no   
 regulations have been broken. The     
 plans then go to the Planning         
 Committee with his recommendations.   
 They decide if they should be         
 approved. If they are not the builder 
 can appeal to the Secretary of State  
 for the Environment.                  </content>
