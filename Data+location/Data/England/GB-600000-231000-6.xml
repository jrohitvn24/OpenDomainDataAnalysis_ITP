    I used to be a{Brownie, }it was    
 great, we played {rounders} on the    
 playing field and all sorts of other  
 games inside.                         
              We paid {10}pence each   
 week for {subs,}if someone was away   
 the place was covered with a {disc }  
 with {A}on.                           
            When we went in every week 
 we did a {registration ring}when every
 body stood in a ring and you said yes 
 when your name was called and then    
 sat down.                             
          Some days we worked on a     
 certain {badge}like {cooking}and{     
{entertainment}it was really good.     
 When we went home, again we stood in a
 ring, joined hands, and sang{Brownie  
{Bells}.Then afterwards we said a {    
{Prayer }together before going home.
