		<title>14MY BROTHER         MELKSHAM</title>
		<content>   I have a little brother named       
 Timothy.  He's unlucky because he can 
 not walk.  He goes to Aloeric School. 
 His work is OK because he is not      
 mentally handicapped.  When it snows  
 he likes it because I pull him in the 
 sledge.  When he falls out he never   
 cries and never really makes a fuss if
 he gets snow in his mouth.  When it is
 hot outside he tries to make the most 
 of it because when it is windy it is  
 too cold for him.  Sometimes when he's
 looking at my football medals I can   
 see him becoming sad because he can't 
 do anything like that.  But he's a    
 really good swimmer.  On Fridays he   
 goes swimming with the school to      
 Corsham.  He uses arm bands and has   
 done 10 widths of the pool doing back 
 stroke.  The Aloeric School has a     
 special unit to look after handicapped
 children.                             </content>
