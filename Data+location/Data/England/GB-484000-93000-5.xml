 Seal and Medmerry County Primary      
 Schools give Selsey Children their    
 introduction to learning.Both admit   
 pupils from 5-10 years.Each of these  
 schools has around 200 children and   
 very pleasant surroundings.There is   
 very good contact between Medmerry and
 Seal school and the Community College 
 where children attend from  10-16, in 
 School Lane,Selsey.The Manhood        
 Community College offers facilities to
 both children and adults during       
 school time and in the evenings.Some  
 children come from Selsey and some    
 come from the surrounding areas of the
 two Primary Schools.Medmerry was Built
 in 1905 when it  was used as an Infant
 School.In 1938 Medmerry became an     
 Infant and Junior School.Seal School  
 was built in 1936.
