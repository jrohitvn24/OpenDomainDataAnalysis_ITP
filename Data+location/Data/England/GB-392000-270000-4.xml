		<title>04BROMSGROVE COURT LEET</title>
		<content>    The Court Leet is held every year  
 in Bromsgrove. Bromsgrove was given a 
 charter by King John in 1199 to hold a
 fair on the 24th June every year. This
 fair has carried on for many years.   
 But now it is not held on the 24th    
 June but on the Saturday nearest to   
 it.                                   
    At first the town councillors walk 
 through the town. The town crier calls
 the people of Bromsgrove to pay       
 attention. The  Court then checks the 
 quality of the leather,the weight  of 
 the bread and the quality of the beer.
 Then the Court goes to open the fair.
