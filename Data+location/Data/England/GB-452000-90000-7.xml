		<title>07HOUSING SURVEY - WOOTTON</title>
		<content>  Most houses in Wootton are between   
 ten and eighty years old. Most houses 
 in Wootton High Street are detached   
 with large gardens and are            
 structurally sound  but they suffer a 
 lot from heavy traffic passing through
 the village on the main road from Ryde
 to Newport. In general the houses are 
 well-maintained, sometimes with the   
 help of local authority grants.       
   Houses tend to be occupied by       
 single families of many ages and in   
 general of a higher than average      
 income . Housing problems include the 
 close proximity of the A3054, noise   
 and occasional vandalism particularly 
 in summer.                            
  Originally the village grew along    
 the main road but in recent years has 
 expanded as new housing estates have  
 been constructed, particularly on the 
 northern side of the village.         </content>
