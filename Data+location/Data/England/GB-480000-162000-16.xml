		<content>   We noticed from our investigations  
 of the area that the majority of      
 houses had been built during the last 
{20 years. }As there is{no local       
{industry}we thought that most people  
 probably worked some way away from    
 home, and had moved into the area     
 because of their job.   We devised a  
{questionnaire,}and were surprised when
 the results showed that only{37%}of   
 the people asked moved into this area 
 for their job.  However, the other    
 results confirmed our thoughts that   
{Little Sandhurst}could really be      
 called{'commuter belt'.  90%}of the   
 people travel to work by{car}and{37%  
 work more that{20 miles}from home.    
 Only{7%}of people worked within what  
 they described as "walking distance"  
 from home. Only{3%}of those who       
 replied used the{train}to get to work.
