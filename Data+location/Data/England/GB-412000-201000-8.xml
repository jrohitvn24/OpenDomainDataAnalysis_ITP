		<title>08THE RIVER COLN, FAIRFORD</title>
		<content>   The part of the river in the section
 that we are covering runs upstream    
 from the town bridge, opposite Busby's
 Garage, then along to the village of  
{Quenington.} From the town bridge to  
{Fairford Mill}the river is straight.  
 In this section it runs past the      
 slopimg gardens of Fairford House and 
 past the church.  The fishing rights  
 here belong to the{Bull Hotel.} Beyond
 the Mill, with its mill pool, the     
 water belongs to the{Ernest Cook      
{Trust.} Travelling upstream there is a
 slow moving wide section, known       
 locally as{Broadwater.} The river,    
 which is a tributary of the{River     
{Thames,}is renowned for its trout     
 fishing.  Although the public can buy 
 a day's fishing on the Bull Hotel     
 stretch,  the other section is        
 strictly private.
