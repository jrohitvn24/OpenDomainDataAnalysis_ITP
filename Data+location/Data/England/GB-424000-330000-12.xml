		<title>12HILTON VILLAGE</title>
		<content> Hilton is still a small village (Pop. 
 1655 in 1981)although in the past few 
 years several groups of new houses    
 have been built.Amenities include two 
 park/play areas and two new tennis    
 courts.The Gravel Pits and Brook      
 provide pleasant areas for walking and
 nature study.There are many           
 organisations,ranging from Scouts,    
 Cubs,Guides,Brownies and a Drama group
 for the youngsters,to the Evergreens  
 for the Senior Citizens.The village   
 also has a W.I.,P.T.A.,Gardening club,
 Cricket and Football clubs and a      
 thriving Village Hall,used for both   
 Public and Private functions.The main 
 A516 Stoke to Derby road cuts through 
 the village,but although talk of a by-
 pass has been going on for many years,
 there is little firm information      
 available at present.
