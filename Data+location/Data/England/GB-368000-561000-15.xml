		<content>    Outside the castle is a very old   
{oak tree.} The distance around the    
 trunk is 5 metres 10 centimetres.     
 It used to have a very long thick     
 branch where a long time ago they used
 to hang six men in a row if they had  
 been caught cattle stealing in a      
 Border raid.                          
    There is supposed to be the ghost  
 of a minstrel who was torn to pieces  
 by the Baron's dogs.  He is called the
{Grey Man}of Bellister.                
    Part of the castle was burned down 
 in 1901 and a new pretend castle was  
 built by Dr Daniel Jackson of Hexham. 
 His grandson, Edward Jackson, left it 
 and the surrounding land, including   
 Debbie's farm, to the{National Trust  
 in 1975.                              
    You are allowed to go and look at  
 the castle if you make an appointment 
 first.                                </content>
