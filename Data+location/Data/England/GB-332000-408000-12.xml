		<title>12LANDSCAPE - THREE MOSSES</title>
		<content> There are a few small coppices in this
 area comprising mixed trees, such as  
 Beech, Sycamore, Hawthorn and         
 Rhododendron affording cover to the   
 pheasants, patridge and other small   
 game birds that abound here. Wood     
 pigeons abound and Collared Doves are 
 now a cause for concern when they     
 descend on the grain or brassicas     
 grown here, although the later have   
 been a protected species for sometime.
 All sorts of wild geese and ducks     
 invade this area to graze, flying in  
 from the Wildlife Reserve at Martin   
 Mere. Some control of these birds in  
 the form of gas controlled bird       
 scarers and other devices are used.   
 Part of the old Cheshire Lines Railway
 is now a wild life conservation area, 
 encouraging wild flowers, birds       
 etc.,There are no hedges as wind      
 breaks in the area.                   </content>
