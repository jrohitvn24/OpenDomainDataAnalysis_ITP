		<title>19THE ANIMAL HEALTH TRUST</title>
		<content>  This charity whose patron is the     
Queen, was originally founded in 1942  
to help veterinary students when it    
was called the Veterinary Educational  
Trust. Since 1946 it has gone on to    
investigate, the diagnosis, cure, and  
prevention, of diseases in animals.    
"That's the phrase that really sums it 
up," says publicity officer Mrs. J.    
Harwood. The Small Animal Centre is in 
Kennet, and the Equine Research Centre 
in Newmarket. There are about 12 vets  
working at the Animal Health Trust.    
  The main diseases they are           
investigating at present, are eye      
problems in dogs. For instance,        
pedigree dogs need to be checked for   
hereditary eye problems. They're also  
interested in cancer in cats and dogs.
