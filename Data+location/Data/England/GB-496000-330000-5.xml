		<content>    The eldest man in Boothby Pagnell  
 aged 84,said that originally the      
 village was a farming village.He had  
 lived in the village since 1938 and   
 the main source of power was the water
 from the River Glen.The main source of
 drinking water was an underground     
 stream which was pumped by 1 man who  
 lived in the club house.              
     The farms around the village could
 not use horses for ploughing because  
 they were not strong enough so they   
 used bulls instead.The local          
 blacksmith used to make shoes for the 
 bulls rather similar to a horse's shoe
 in his forge in the village.          
     The carpenter in the village,up   
 till recently repaired things and also
 made coffins in his workshop also in  
 the village.                          
                                       
                                       </content>
