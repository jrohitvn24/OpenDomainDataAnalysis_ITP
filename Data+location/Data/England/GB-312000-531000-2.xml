 The outputs of the farms in this area 
 are milk, wool and meat. The milk is  
 collected by Milk Marketing Board bulk
 tankers daily and taken to Carlisle   
 and Aspatria for manufacture into     
 cheese or butter.                     
   The wool is collected by the Wool   
 Marketing Board and distributed to    
 mills throughout the country. The     
 sheep that have been fattened or are  
 too old to breed can be sold weekly at
 Cockermouth and Penrith auctions. Beef
 cattle are sold weekly at Penrith and 
 at Cockermouth there are two auctions 
 one weekly and the other every        
 fortnight.                            
   Surplus fodder crops, especially    
 grasses, are sold weekly at Carlisle's
 auction mart.
