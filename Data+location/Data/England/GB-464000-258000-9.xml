		<title>09THE MONDAY CLUB</title>
		<content>The Monday Club was started in 1967 to 
allow women to get together and listen 
to interesting speakers. People have   
been going to Monday Club for periods  
of 2 months to 16 years. 15 to 20      
people go to Monday Club and most of   
them like it. Most people like meeting 
people, talks &amp; outings. Recent outings
have been to Church's China Shop, the  
P.O. in Northampton, the Express Lifts 
Tower and a dinner at the Heart of     
England pub. The Monday Club is only   
for women because it is a member of the
National Association of Women's Clubs. 
Men are invited if the subject being   
discussed interests them. The Monday   
Club performs a pantomime every year   
and most people who go have been on    
stage at some time. They also raise    
money for charity; they have raised    
money to provide a Guide Dog and also  
the swings and slide on the Green.     </content>
