        Just as, 20 years ago, there   
 were two schools in the survey area,  
 so, as recently as l979, there were   
 eight shops.  As more people          
 increasingly spent their working days 
 in nearby towns, they shopped at town 
 supermarkets so, one by one,, village 
 shops closed.  The last to shut its   
 doors was an electrical contractors'  
 at Hethe (pop. 292) in the summer of  
 l985.  Four years earlier, a general  
 stores and Post Office ceased to      
 operate from the village pub at Stoke 
 Lyne and a rural post office now      
 operates froom a nearby detached      
 owner-occupied house.
