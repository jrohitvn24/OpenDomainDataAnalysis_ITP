		<title>16A DISTRICT NURSE IN APEDALE</title>
		<content>                                       
    As a State Enrolled District Nurse,
 living in a rural area, my base is    
 Church Stretton Health Centre, about 9
 miles away. I work 37 hours a week,   
 having every Thursday and every other 
 weekend off. I work all Bank Holidays 
 and have 35 days leave annually. Most 
 of my patients are in the older age   
 bracket and welcome the opportunity of
 a chat. I carry out the same basic    
 nursing duties in the patient's home  
 as I would have done in a hospital.   
 These include Dressings, Baths,Enemas,
 Catheterizations,Injections,Observatio
 ns. In addition to these duties, I    
 also have to act as an adviser to the 
 families. Every visit has to be       
 recorded both in the home and at the  
 Centre. A busy but extremely rewarding
 life,and one full of human interest.
