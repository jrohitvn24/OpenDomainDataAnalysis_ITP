		<title>15THE PIER-    SW.BOGNOR REGIS</title>
		<content>{The Pier}was built in{1863-65}at a    
 cost of{Â£5000.}It was then{305 metres 
 long. The extension and the{Pavilion  
 at the end of the Pier were both      
 opened in{1900.}The{landing stage}for 
 paddle steamers was added in{1903.}In 
 1908 the Pier was sold to The Bognor  
 Pier company for 10/6 (52.5p).It      
 was widened in{1910-11} so that people
 could reach the end of the Pier       
 without passing through the theatre.  
 The Pier became its present length    
 because of a storm in{1965}which      
 caused the sea-end to break off.The   
 pier was repainted in{1976.}Now in    
{1985 }there are different facilities  
 available on the Pier.There is a new  
{night club}called "Sheik's" in the old
 theatre,there is  also a{Kiddies' fun 
{fair,}an{amusement arcade}and a       
{cafeteria.}It is also possible to{fish
 off the Pier at a cost of 50p.        </content>
