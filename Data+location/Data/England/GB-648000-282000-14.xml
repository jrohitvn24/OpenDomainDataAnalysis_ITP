		<title>14Dairy Farming</title>
		<content> I live near a dairy farm. The cows    
 belong to Farmer Chipperfield. The    
 farmer sells his milk to the Milk     
 Marketing Board. The field is behind  
 our house. Sometimes the cows are put 
 on another field that is behind the   
 one near us. The cows are on the field
 at the moment. The farmer moves them  
 so that the grass can regrow. There is
 a barbed wire fence all around the    
 field so people can't get in but we   
 can take our dog for a walk on the    
 field when the cows aren't in it. At  
 about 8.30 in the morning the cows are
 fed. Two weeks ago (early June) they  
 came and cut the grass and threw      
 stones onto our garden. The farmer    
 also has one field of wheat. When this
 is cut they have to shoot all the     
 rabbits.             Rachael Burley
