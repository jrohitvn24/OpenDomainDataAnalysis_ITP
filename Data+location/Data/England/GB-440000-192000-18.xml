There are three mills in East Hanney.  
None of them are working mills.        
{Venn Mill.}                           
Venn Mill is on the old Roman Road out 
of Hanney on the way to Oxford.The     
owner is trying to restore the mill to 
working condition.It is quite old .    
{Dandridge Mill.}                      
Dandridge Mill was built in about 1820.
It is in working order but is not in   
useany more.                           
{Lower Mill.}                          
The mill wheel at Lower Mill has been  
removed and when we saw around it,it   
was used for chickens.
