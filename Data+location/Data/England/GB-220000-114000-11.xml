		<title>11Morwenstow - Societies</title>
		<content> The block has eleven different  clubs,
 teams and  societies.                 
 The long established Men's and Women's
 Institutes  incorporate   a    women's
 skittles  team  and the men's skittles
 and snooker teams.                    
 There are four other sporting clubs;- 
 the football club,darts teams,male and
 female, a badminton club, and the new-
 est arrival, a short mat bowling club.
 The  Morwenstow Society  was formed to
 study  local history and  'to preserve
 the past and present for the future'. 
 There  is also a  Cornish Dancing Club
 named  Myrghes  Morwenna,   which   is
 Cornish for  'Maids of Morwenstow', so
 named  because  it is difficult to get
 any of the local men to join in.      
 There  is  very  little for youngsters
 and  teenagers;  if  they want to join
 the cubs or brownies,for instance,they
 must travel outside the area.         </content>
