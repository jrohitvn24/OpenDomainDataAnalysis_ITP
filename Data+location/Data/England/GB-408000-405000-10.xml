		<title>10Education  Typical day</title>
		<content> School begins at 8.55am with          
 registration which lasts until 9.25am.
 During this time the register is      
 taken, the daily bulletin is read out 
 and we sometimes play quiz games. We  
 then go to our first lesson (sewing on
 this particular day), which lasts for 
 two 35 minute periods-one hour and ten
 minutes in all. We then have a        
 15minute break during which we go out 
 into the school yard.                 
  After this break we have one period  
 of French in the language block, and  
 then go back to our Form Room for a   
 single lesson of English with our Form
 Teacher. It is then for our Dinner    
 Break which lasts for one hour and ten
 minutes. During this time we may go   
 home, or we may stay at school for our
 meal.
