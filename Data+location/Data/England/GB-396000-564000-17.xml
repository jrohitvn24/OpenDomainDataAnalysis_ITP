		<title>17LOCAL HISTORY IN CORBRIDGE</title>
		<content>   From the bridge,built in 1674,some  
 of the most prominent buildings in    
 and around Corbridge can be seen.The  
 Tower of the medieval Church,with its 
 Anglo_Saxon base and Roman stonework  
 still dominates the centre.The Roman  
 Watling Street was the major North to 
 South route and its river crossing    
 point gave Corstopitum its strategic  
 importance.Many village streets follow
 medieval lines and the medieval past  
 still touches the present throng of   
 buildings such as the Vicar's Pele    
 and Low Hall.The King's Oven and      
 overgrown St.Andrews Well both recall 
 the communal life of the medieval     
 village.To the west of the village    
 Beaufront Castle is an imposing       
 country house built in the nineteenth 
 century.
