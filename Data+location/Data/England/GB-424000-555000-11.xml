		<content> There are 1494 houses in Birtley      
 privately owned and 1457 houses rented
 by the council. Some houses are let   
 privately.                            
    There is a higher than average     
 council housing sector but            
 overcrowding and houses lacking basic 
 amenities are fairly typical.         
    Over 47O pensioners live alone, 26 
 of these live in houses which do not  
 have their own bathroom or inside     
 toilet.Over one third of the houses in
 Birtley contain at least one          
 pensioner. 481 live in council        
 property 167 own homes.               
    Older houses in Birtley need       
 improving but the council say they do 
 not have enough money to do this.     
    The newest are at Fell Bank, these 
 are privately built.                  
    A new council estate is planned for
 Northside with 1,OOO houses.          </content>
