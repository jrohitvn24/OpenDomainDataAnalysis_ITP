		<content> This block as a whole is primarily    
 farmland. Contains two pretty villages
 with narrow roads, numerous farms,    
 country houses and two Estates; family
 home of the largest, converted into a 
 Health Clinic in 1966, attracting     
 National celebreties. The owners still
 run it. Largest village, Coddenham,   
 nestling in rich undulating           
 countryside, has a very impressive    
 Church and a few shops. A Roman road  
 passes through, leading from the      
 remains of a Roman settlement to the  
 West. In the East, the small village  
 of Hemingstone has an interesting old 
 Church, cottages and a large Fruit    
 Farm. Well cultivated fields, ancient 
 hedgerows and scattered woods. Popular
 with tourists in cars, cycling or on  
 foot. Typical Suffolk cottages and    
 timber framed houses to be seen. Towns
 of Needham Market and Ipswich near.   </content>
