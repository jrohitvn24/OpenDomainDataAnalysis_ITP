		<content>         One of the area's most famous 
 buildings is Parbold Hall, which was  
 originally held by the Lathom family  
 dating from the 13th. Century. The    
 Lathom family fought on the side of   
 the Royalists in the Civil War and    
 lost their estates in 1651. The Hall  
 was later bought by the Dicconson     
 family of Wrightington Hall in 1791   
 and remained in the family until the  
 1930s. In 1802 the Hall became for a  
 time the home of some Benedictine     
 monks who had been sent out of France 
 during the Revolution.                
         In 1985, the Hall is owned by 
 the Moores family who are nationally  
 known as owners of the Littlewoods    
 Pools and Mail Order Companies.
