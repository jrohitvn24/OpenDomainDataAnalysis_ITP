The R.A.F dominates the Halton scene   
as a technical training centre for     
apprentices who move on to operational 
stations. The small airfield           
accomodates light aircraft and a       
popular gliding club. An important     
annual event is the Halton Air and     
Motor Show which often includes the    
famous Red Arrows Air Display Team.    
Princess Mary's hospital contains      
centres for tropical diseases and      
dentistry. The village itself, centred 
around St.Michael's Church, provides   
dormitory accommodation for camp       
personnel. It still retains its        
original charm,in spite  of in-filling 
since 1975 but there are no pubs or    
shops. The annual fete is              
still the most popular fund raising    
event.
