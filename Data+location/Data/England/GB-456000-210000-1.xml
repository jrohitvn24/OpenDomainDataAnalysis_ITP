		<title>01BECKLEY &amp; HORTON-CUM-STUDLEY</title>
		<content>Our area includes Beckley, part of     
Horton-cum-Studley, and the hamlet of  
Woodperry.To the north lies Otmoor, a  
low fenland which has been the focus   
of much local concern having been      
threatened first by a scheme to turn   
it into a reservoir and now  by the    
building of a motorway connecting      
the Midlands to the existing M40 at    
Waterstock. In 1985 no major roads     
cross our area. The B4027 from         
Wheatley to Islip passes through the   
bottom SW corner and was once the      
turnpike road from London with four    
inns near to Beckley. Much of the land 
was once forested and some woodlands   
remain. Beckley Park, a triple-moated  
hunting lodge built in 1540 is near    
one of the suggested routes of the     
motorway. Other large houses include   
Middle Park Farm, Grove House,Beckley; 
Studley Priory &amp; Woodperry House.      </content>
