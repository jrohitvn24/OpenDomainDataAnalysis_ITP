    The oldest houses are to be found  
 in the Old Town area, but with the    
 advent of the{railway in 1845}a       
 complete new Victorian town grew up to
 the south. In the basically untouched 
 countryside of our block only         
 scattered dwellings were built then,  
 within reach of the only road to      
 Eastbourne or around Station Road, now
 London Road. Then a development was   
 begun centred around Victoria and     
 Albert Roads, now called Cambridge and
 Havelock. The{first major development 
 in the{1930's}followed the railway    
 line to link{Old Town with Sidley}to  
 the north. Few houses were built      
 during the 2nd World War but rapid    
{expansion}took place westwards from   
 the{late 50's,}dominated by{Larkin,}a 
 a well-known{local builder,}of mainly 
 distinctive self-designed{bungalows.  </content>
