		<title>04OCCUPATIONS IN BALQUHIDDER</title>
		<content> In the summer season the people of    
 Balquhidder are employed in different 
 tourist occupations. Hotels and guest 
 houses are open and Kingshouse hotel  
 has a popular bar. There is also a    
 restaurant nearby which caters for    
 passing tourists. There is a campsite 
 being opened and pony treking will be 
 available there. Altogether there are 
 seven farms in the glen. There is one 
 pig farm and the others are mostly    
 hill farms. Forestry is an expanding  
 industry in this area and some men    
 work at this. There are two joiners   
 and builders and there is a local shop
 which sells fishing tackle and        
 groceries. Also in the glen there is a
 teacher, a nurse and a minister and   
 the rest of the people living here are
 retired and no longer work.
