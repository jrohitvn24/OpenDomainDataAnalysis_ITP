		<content> THE{BORDER RALILWAY}LINE RAN THROUGH  
 THE AREA FOR JUST UNDER A CENTURY     
 CLOSING IN 1956 BY WHICH TIME THE MAIN
 TRANSPORT WAS BUSES AND CARS.         
 STATIONS ARE NOW PLEASANT HOUSES, FEW 
 HAVE BEEN NEGLECTED AND HUMSHAUGH     
 STATION, NOW THE BEECHING, IS A GOOD  
 EXAMPLE.                              
 THE ARCHITECT OF{CHOLLERTON VIADUCT   
 COMMITTED SUICIDE ON THE EVE BEFORE   
 OPENING, THINKING HIS VIADUCT WOULD   
 COLLAPSE.                             
 BY THE ROADSIDE NEAR KEEPERSHIELD FARM
 IS AN ANCIENT MONUMENT, NOT IN USE    
 NOW BUT ORIGINALLY USED TO WATER      
 HORSES TRAVELLING BETWEEN BELLINGHAM  
 AND HEXHAM.  THE{ROMAN CAMP}OVER BY   
 WALWICK FELL HAS NOT BEEN EXCAVATED.  
 THE FIELDS IN THE AREA ARE USUALLY    
 BORDERED BY DRY{STONE WALLS}WHICH ARE 
 WELL MAINTAINED.
