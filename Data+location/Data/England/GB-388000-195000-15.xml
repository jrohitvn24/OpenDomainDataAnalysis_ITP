		<content> For a small village,{Avening}has had  
 quite a few {EVENTS}in 1985. The      
 Rector, having retired last year, was 
 replaced by Priest-in-Charge, Father  
 Paul Noble. "Lamps and Lights", a     
 small home-based craft industry making
 coloured table lamps was opened. In   
 June the Avening Women's Institute    
 made{NEWS}when they entertained women 
 from many other associations by       
 providing them with a conducted tour  
 of the Village, Church and Avening    
 Court. Of the few{CUSTOMS}associated  
 with the area, the most noteworthy is 
 "Pig Face Day". In 1080 Matilda, wife 
 of William the Conqueror, had Britric,
 her former admirer, imprisoned and    
 later hanged in Gloucester Jail. So   
 regretful was she, that she decided to
 found a Church in his memory: "Holy   
 Cross Parish Church". This {HISTORY}  
 is re-enacted each September.         </content>
