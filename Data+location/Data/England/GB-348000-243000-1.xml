		<content> The area between Hereford and Morton  
 on Lugg is predominantly rural,       
 containing several farms, but there   
 are areas of housing in square 3      
 (Moreton on Lugg) and square 7.       
 There is also an industrial estate in 
 Moreton on Lugg (square 4).   Most of 
 the amenities in the block are        
 situated in square 3, Moreton on Lugg.
 They are:-a primary school            
           village stores              
           petrol filling station      
           a church                    
 There are two other churches, at      
 Portway, and Pipe and Lyde.   There is
 also a garage with servicing at Pipe  
 and Lyde.   The area is very near the 
 city of Hereford, with its many       
 facilities.   The land is mostly      
 cultivated, with a little pastureland,
 and some rough grazing in half of the 
 squares.                              </content>
