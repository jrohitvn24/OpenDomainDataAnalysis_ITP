		<title>02      DUNSWELL</title>
		<content>     Dunswell is  small village only   
 two miles away from Hull on the       
 Hull-Beverley road (A1079).Although   
 the flats of the nearby Hull council  
 estate can be seen from Dunswell Lane,
 it is a different community entirely. 
 There is little unemployment with     
 upper to middle class occupations     
 predominating.  According to an       
 unofficial survey about 600 people    
 live in the 200 or so houses in       
 Dunswell.                             
     The main village road is well     
 known as an accident 'blackspot',     
 though the only concession to passing 
 traffic is a zebra crossing near the  
 school.                               
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
