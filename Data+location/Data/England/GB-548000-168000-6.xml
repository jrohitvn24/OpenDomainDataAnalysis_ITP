		<content>  St.Peters church is not like other   
churches because it used to be a school
too. Reverend Egerton was the last     
person to own Hextable. When he died,it
was sold,but his son saved some land to
build St.Peters church on. There was a 
folding door across the hall,so the    
church became two classrooms,each with 
a fireplace. This was also used as a   
school,and so on Sundays,screens were  
put over the work and an altar put out.
There is still a school bell which is  
rusty now.                             
  A proper school was built,so         
St.Peters became just a church and     
later a church hall with the playground
as a carpark because a new church part 
was built in 1978. It is unusual       
because it is octaganal and has a      
pointed wooden roof,the chairs pack    
away and the stainless steel floor can 
be moved wherever it is wanted.        </content>
