The A428 which goes through the length 
of the village is a busy road          
connecting Northampton and Rugby. This 
creates safety problems as the road has
two sharp bends and at one point there 
is not a footpath on one side of the   
road. Lorries have shed their loads    
when travelling too fast around the    
bends. Once directly through a home's  
window.                                
On several occassions lorries had      
difficulty in passing where the road   
narrows.                               
There were two accidents this summer   
where children were knocked over by    
vehicles, fortunately no serious       
injuries occured.                      
The road becomes heavily congested when
traffic is diverted from the M1        
motorway due to maintainance or        
accidents.                             </content>
