		<title>03COGENHOE ... recent history.</title>
		<content>   During the{Industrial Revolution    
 canals were dug and the River Nene was
 connected to a national system of     
 communication.                        
   The coming of the railways led to   
 the excavation of iron ore and locals 
 can be legitimately proud of being the
{first place in England}to extract iron
 ore by mining. Clay was dug too, but  
 brick making was spasmodic and short  
 lived. However, bricks with the name  
{COGENHOE}inscribed on the side still  
 have the habit of reappearing.        
   In 1924,{Anderson York,}organised a 
 passenger and goods service which ran 
 from Cogenhoe to the neighbouring     
 villages and from there into the      
 market town of Northampton.           
   Since that time a number of modern  
 houses have been built which when     
 mixed with the Tudor and Victorian    
 give the village a muddled look.      </content>
