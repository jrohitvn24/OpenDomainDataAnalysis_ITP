		<title>05FORTHAMPTON VILLAGE HOUSES</title>
		<content> The village has seen little change    
 during the centuries with only a few  
 houses being built and a few          
 demolished. There are however a large 
 number of interesting buildings for   
 such a small village. The  Sanctuary  
 is thought to be the oldest house,    
 built by Tewkesbury Abbey at the end  
 of the 15th Century. Modernisation was
 carried out in 1973 without destroying
 its character. The forge however has  
 lost all its original form and only   
 the outbuildings remain as a memory of
 its use. Brewers cottage still has    
 part of its wattle and daube          
 consruction. Most of the houses are   
 half timbered and a number are still  
 thatched. Each one has its own        
 interesting history and features      
 worthy of further investigation in a  
 village which is proud of its past and
 happy to share it.                    </content>
