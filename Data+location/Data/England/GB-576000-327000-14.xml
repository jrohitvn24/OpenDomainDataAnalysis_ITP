		<title>14ESTATE FORESTRY -HOUGHTON</title>
		<content> There are 3OO acres of broadleaf,25O  
 acres of mixed woodland, small stands 
 of poplar in wet areas and in the     
 3OO acres of parkland a further 2-3OO 
 trees. The silviculture practised in  
 the Houghton woodlands emphasises     
 natural regeneration. If this fails   
 group planting is used with uneven age
 age development; clear felling is     
 avoided. Oak, beech, ash, sycamore and
 larch are grown on shallow sands over 
 lying the chalk and Scots pine,       
 cypress, Tsuga ,Thuga and Douglas fir 
 on deeper deposits and boulder clay.A 
 head forester and 5 men work the      
 woodlands but the felling is done by  
 contractors under license. Hard woods 
 are sold for furniture and veneer and 
 soft woods for  building and joinery. 
 In addition to its commercial role the
 forest prevents wind blow, gives      
 shelter to game and is an amenity.    </content>
