		<title>16Filming "Pickwick Papers".</title>
		<content>   {Last August}I was lucky enough to  
 be in the{Television series}of        
{"Pickwick Papers"}by Charles Dickens. 
                                       
    The series was{partly filmed}at    
{Stanley Hall}near Bridgnorth.The Hall 
 was{chosen}for filming because the    
 directors thought it was like{Dingley 
{Dell}in the book.They only took film  
 of the{outside}of the house.          
                                       
    Because I live nearby,I was allowed
 to{help}with the{scenery}and{acting.} 
 I{played}Mr Winkle's{cousin}and had to
{speak}a few lines as well. When I     
{helped}get the{scenes ready}I worked  
 with Mike who was the{Scene Setter.   
                                       
    In one scene we had to{spray       
 Stanley Hall with{foam}to make it look
 like{snow.}The{filming}took{two weeks.
