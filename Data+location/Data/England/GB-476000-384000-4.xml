		<content> STURTON-LE-STEEPLE VILLAGE.           
 Sturton-le-Steeple is a small village 
 but very intersting.Lots of farmers   
 live in Sturton and one of the pilgrim
 fathers came  from Sturton .Sturton   
 has got a playing field and village   
 hall church and chael next year the   
 school will be 150 years old.The      
 pilgrim fathers House is still in the 
 village.We have a beck that runs      
 throug.the village and next to the    
 beck is a pub called the Reinder inn  
 it sells sweets and choclate because  
 Sturton has no shop.There is a small  
 Post Office and Telephone Exethange   
 next to it which is about 7 years old 
 we have two bus stops in the village. 
 The power station provides many jobs  
 for villages.The river Trent runs to  
 the East,about two and ahalf miles    
 away.
