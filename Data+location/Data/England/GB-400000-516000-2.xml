		<content> The{Teesdale Mercury}was first started
 in 1854.Mr.McTaggart who is the       
 present editor has been editor for the
 Teesdale Mercury for twelve years .The
 biggest story for the Mercury lately  
 has been the new supermarket that is  
 opening in September next to the car  
 park.The biggest stories ever for the 
 Mercury were when a forty feet high   
 bore came down the river and completly
 demolished the footbridge,killing two 
 people and injuring four others.The   
 stories for the Mercury are mainly    
 anything that happens in this         
 area.Most people see the shortage of  
 work in the area as their biggest     
 problem.The Mercury prints most       
 letters that are sent in,especially if
 they are about local matters.The      
 Mercury has a complete set of past    
 issues from 1854.
