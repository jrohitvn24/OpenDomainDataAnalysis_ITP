		<content> The information on our area was       
 gathered by the children from Beech   
 Grove Junior School,St.James Primary  
 School,St.Peter's Comprehensive School
 and St.Mary's Junior School.          
 The schools in our area have seen much
 change over the last few years.This   
 has been because of falling rolls     
 which has caused the amalgamation of  
 some schools.The new road going       
 through Grangetown has meant that     
 Grangetown Primary school has had to  
 move to a different building and this 
 in turn led to other schools in       
 Grangetown having to move too .
