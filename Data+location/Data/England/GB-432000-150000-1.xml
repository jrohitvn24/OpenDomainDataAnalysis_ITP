		<title>01GENERAL REVIEW-HATHERDEN</title>
		<content> This block comprises of three small   
 villages, Hatherden, Tangley and      
 Wildhern and the land is mainly used  
 for agriculture.There are just over   
 two hundred dwellings and the recent  
 electoral roll showed 453 adults. The 
 only school in the block is at        
 Hatherden and there are 52 children,  
 28 of them are between 7 and 11 and 24
 aged between 5 and 7.There is no shop 
 of any kind but a Post Office can be  
 found in Hatherden. Wildhern has a    
 Methodist Chapel and a village hall   
 with a lovely playing field where the 
 annual Summer Fete is held in July to 
 raise funds for the Tangley and       
 Hatherden churches and the school. A  
 playgroup also meets twice a week in  
 the village hall and money was raised 
 two years ago to provide swings and a 
 climbing frame on the site for younger
 children.                             </content>
