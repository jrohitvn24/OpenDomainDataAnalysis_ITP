		<title>18PEOPLE IN EAST MERSEA</title>
		<content>   In a survey of 55 households in East
 Mersea the average length of residence
 was calculated at 15 years. 3 people  
 had been resident for more than 60    
 years(the longest recorded was 65     
 years) and a third of the sample had  
 been resident for 20 years or more.   
 Only 6% had moved in within the last  
 year the same percentage as in the    
 1981 census.                          
   The dilemna of living in rural areas
 was also revealed by this survey.Some 
 58% of those interviewed considered   
 peace and quiet the most attractive   
 aspect of East Mersea. A further 14%  
 liked the countryside or the sea.     
 However 30% said the lack of          
 transport,particularly the bus-service
 was the biggest disadvantage.Other    
 problems mentioned were the isolation,
 adverse weather in winter and few     
 entertainments for young children.    </content>
