		<title>08St.Nicholas Church/Bells</title>
		<content> In June l985 St. Nicholas's Church    
 held a flower festival to celebrate   
 the three hundredth anniversary of the
 hanging of the bells. Flower festivals
 are popular in this area and the      
 arrangements at this one depicted the 
 Bells, The Apostles, St. Nicholas and 
 Christ. The history of one bell is    
 shrouded in mystery, for though it    
 bears the date l07l there are doubts  
 abouts its true age. The bell was     
 moved from Middle Littleton Church,   
 where it had probably hung above the  
 altar and was then taken to St.       
 Michael's Church, South Littleton. Now
 the bell has been renovated, but      
 because it was cracked for many years,
 is still not rung. The tower contains 
 six bells, installed in l685,which    
 have decorative asabesque borders     
 between the words inscribed upon them.
