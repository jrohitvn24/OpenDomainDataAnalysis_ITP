		<title>13THE GLYNDE VILLAGE SHOP</title>
		<content> The present shopkeeper has managed the
 shop for the last 7 years. There has  
 been a shop here for 150 years. The   
 previous shopkeepers had the shop     
 before for 25 years. The shop belongs 
 to the Glynde estates and the         
 shopkeeper had to be interviewed      
 before she could run it.              
 The shop was originally the coach     
 house of the Pear Tree Inn which was  
 next door. It is now the only shop in 
 Glynde but there used to be a bakers, 
 wheelwrights, forge and a butcher.    
 The shop sells groceries, cards,      
 rabbit food, footballs, small toys and
 second hand books.                    
 A baker comes round to the houses but 
 the shop sells bread as well.
