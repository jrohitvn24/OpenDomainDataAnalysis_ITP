		<title>02A CHILD'S DAY</title>
		<content> On Friday I get up at 7.00 and get    
 dressed. After breakfast I clean my   
 teeth. At 8.50 our dad drives us to   
 school.After the whistle we have      
 assembly and then we go to the dining 
 room and watch TV. It's called        
 "History All Around Us". After that at
 10.35 we have playtime. Later we have 
 an hour's work. Some are fast workers 
 so they can read for a few minutes. We
 go over for dinner at 12.00 and go out
 to play at 12.30. When we come in     
 at 1.15 we have a little time's work. 
 At 2.45 Mrs. Miller reads us our      
 story. At home time my brother Ben and
 I walk home on our own. Charles       
 follows us soon. Then I watch TV      
 or play with Ben until tea time.After 
 tea Charles goes to a club and comes  
 back at 9.00. I get in my nightie and 
 then I clean my teeth, then go to bed.
