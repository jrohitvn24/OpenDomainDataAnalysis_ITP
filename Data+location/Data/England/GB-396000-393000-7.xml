		<title>07 CHURCHES AND SCHOOLS</title>
		<content>    The Anglican and Methodist Churches
shared the same building at first. Now 
it is only an Anglican Church and the  
Methodist part seems to have gone.     
There is a Catholic Church and Horeb   
Baptist Church which is a very small   
building. The attendance at the        
churches seems to be good.             
    There are five Primary Schools and 
of which one is Roman Catholic and one 
Comprehensive School. As the birth rate
is still falling some of these schools 
may have to close.                     
    At one time children from the      
surrounding area were not allowed by   
their parents to go to Hattersley      
because there were slum clearance      
houses and they felt their children    
should not mix with the families there.
At present more children are attending 
the Comprehensive Schools and the      
stigma is not so great.                </content>
