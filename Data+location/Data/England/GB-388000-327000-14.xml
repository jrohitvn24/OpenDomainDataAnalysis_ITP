		<content>                                       
 because of a total lack of public     
 transport locally.Few people use      
 trains regularly or at all,though     
 there are regular services from Stone 
 and Stefford,which are no more than   
 six miles away.                       
   Most homes have television,a        
 refrigerator,a freezer,a washing      
 machine and a telephone but only 4 had
 a home computer.Athird of the         
 households grow some of their         
 vegetables:a similar number grow none.
   A large of pets are kept,ranging    
 from pigeons to ponies,and cats to    
 guinea pigs.Half the peoplehad had no 
 holiday last year,though 4 had had    
 2.Seven had been abroad.For           
 shopping,Stafford was the most popular
 centre,there being no village shop.   
 Allso lacking are a pub,a school or   
 any club building.                    </content>
