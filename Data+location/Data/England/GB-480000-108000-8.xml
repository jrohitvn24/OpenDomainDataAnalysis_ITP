		<title>08KINGLEY VALE NATURE TRAIL</title>
		<content>{Kingley Vale}is about six km N.E. of  
{Chichester.}The nature trail is part  
 of a national nature reserve.It is    
 about four km around the trail which  
 would take about two hours to walk.The
 trail tells the story of the finest   
 yew forest in Europe.Some of the yews 
 are 500 years old but some of them are
 younger.There is a field museum where 
 stuffed animals and birds can be seen.
 The trail goes through woodland,down- 
 land and pasture.It is well signposted
 with information about the flora and  
 fauna.On the trail is the Tansley     
 Stone dedicated to Sir Arthur         
 Tansley,the first chairman of the     
 Nature Conservancy which bought the   
 land for a nature reserve in 1952.It  
 is thought that flint was mined on the
 slopes in the Stone Age. On Bow Hill  
 are Bronze Age tumuli.
