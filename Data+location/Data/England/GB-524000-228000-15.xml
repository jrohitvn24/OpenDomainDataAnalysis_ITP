		<title>15THE LEGEND OF JACK O'LEGS</title>
		<content>  In{1138}the legend of{Jack O'Legs}was
 born. Jack lived in a cave in the     
 woods near Weston, Herts. This wood is
 now a cultivated field. Jack was as   
 big as a giant. He was a local{hero.  
 Like the tale of Robin Hood, Jack used
 to{rob the rich to feed the poor.}One 
 day he stole bread from the baker at  
 Baldock mill and was caught in the act
 he was clobbered and blinded. Before  
 the hanging Jack asked if he could    
 fire an arrow and wherever it landed  
 he wanted to be buried. He is supposed
 to  have fired it from Baldock and it 
 landed in Weston churchyard, which is 
 a distance of nearly three miles.     
 There he was buried. Two stones mark  
 his long grave set fourteen feet      
 apart. He is reputed to be folded in  
 three such was his great{Giant}height!
 The story may be based on the Second  
 Earl of Pembroke, known as{Strongbow. </content>
