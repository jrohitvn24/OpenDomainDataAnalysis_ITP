		<content> Unemployment is high in this area,many
 people except unemployment as a way of
 lifeand feel a resentment toward      
 government which does not seem to be  
 helping to relieve the                
 situation.Burglaries are also common  
 and many people blame this on high    
 unemployment.Other topics which cause 
 concern in the area are the general   
 pollution i.e. Litter,Graffitti and   
 the vast amounts of dog excrets on    
 pavements,park and beach areas.Members
 of the Royal family were generally    
 well received recently although again 
 there was some protest from the       
 unemployed.However,Sunderland people  
 are very attached to the area and     
 prefer not to move awayfrom the area  
 if possible.                          
  Vandalism is common in many of the   
 poorer housing areas and the blocks of
 flats near the docks.                 </content>
