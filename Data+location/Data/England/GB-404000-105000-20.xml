		<content>     Mannington-A Village?             
     This was the only area in our     
 block apart from farms where there was
 any collection of buildings. However  
 we did not find here a village of any 
 great size,nor had it unlike other    
 villages been much bigger in the last 
 century.                              
     The village was largely spread    
 along the length of one road known as 
 Burt's Lane, this was not a major     
 route,but it joined busier routes at  
 it's N&amp;S junctions-even the pub was   
 not in the centre of the village!     
     It is likely that the village     
 provided some services for the very   
 scattered smallholdings and farms,    
 some of the buildings still show there
 former use, The Old Posthouse, The Old
 Schoolhouse and the converted General 
 Stores.Today the village is a mixture 
 of small farms,houses &amp; stables.      </content>
