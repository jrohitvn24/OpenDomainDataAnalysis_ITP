		<title>14Pendomer: Schools</title>
		<content> The only school in the block is       
 Halstock Primary, whose roll is       
 currently 15. The main building is    
 Victorian, there is also a hut and an 
 asphalt playground, and a good playing
 field nearby. Some years ago an       
 application for planning consent to   
 erect some 10 houses near the school  
 aimed at "first time buyers" was      
 frustrated by local opposition; now   
 that there is a real risk of the      
 school closing through lack of young  
 families in the village, raising      
 doubts about future arrangements for  
 the groups that meet in the school,   
 people are having second thoughts and 
 it seems that the proposal for houses 
 may be revived. Older Halstock        
 children go by bus to secondary school
 in Beaminster; there are sometimes    
 problems when those over 16 want to go
 on to Yeovil College in Somerset.     </content>
