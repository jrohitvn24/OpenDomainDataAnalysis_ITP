		<title>06VINTAGE VANS IN DIGSWELL</title>
		<content> Malcolm Marsh has a butchers shop in  
 Digswell village.  He delivers his    
 meat in restored vintage vans.  His   
 hobby of restoring old vehicles began 
 in 1958.  With a friend helping, it   
 takes 4 years to restore a van or car.
 He has 3 vans and 2 cars in a long    
 garage beside his house near his shop.
 He is restoring a black van at the    
 moment.  It is all in pieces.  One of 
 his vans started life as a laundry van
 in Norfolk in 1929;  another was a    
 cobblers van in St Albans in 1936.    
 The vans are painted in the same      
 colours of green and white.  An agent 
 from London paid Mr Marsh to use      
 photographs of him and his vans for   
 calendars and jigsaw puzzles. I have  
 one of the jigsaws. {RICHARD JACKSON
