I like watching the stars and planets. 
I am a member of the Junior            
Astronomical Society.                  
I also like running and I go to a club 
on Tuesdays and Thursdays.             
I play the violin and I have lessons on
Mondays.I also play the recorder which 
I learn at school.                     
My  pets are a dog a cat,a gerbil,a    
rabbit and three guinea pigs.          
I have a BBC B computer which I        
sometimes use in my spare time. I like 
nature and rock scrambling and         
wildlife. My favourite sports are      
cricket and rounders.                  
My Dad is an architect and designs     
houses. My Mum works as a cleaner twice
a week. I have a brother and a sister.
