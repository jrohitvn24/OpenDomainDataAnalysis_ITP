		<content>  Rye is a small town about three miles
 from the South-East coast of England. 
 From the air it looks like an island, 
 because it was once nearly surrounded 
 by sea. Much of our area is very flat 
 marshland and rough grazing and is    
 mainly used for sheep farming. Our    
 area also includes the village of     
 Playden.                              
  The river Rother which flows through 
 Rye provides a gateway for the        
 fishermen to go to sea. As well as    
 being very old Rye is a member of the 
 Cinque Ports. Rye has a lot of        
 historical interest, and is often used
 in films and television. In summer    
 many tourists come to visit Rye. For  
 anyone who wants to see what the town 
 was like in the 18th century there is 
 the town model. Rye also has a vast   
 number of gift shops, antique         
 shops, restaurants and potteries.     </content>
