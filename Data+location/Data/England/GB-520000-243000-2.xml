		<content> Stratton was founded in 1951. It was a
 Grammar School and you had to pass an 
 examination to get in. The building   
 was completed in 1955 and they used   
 Italian craftsmen to lay the marble   
 effect floors. In 1951, there were    
 approximately 600 pupils in the       
 school. By 1959, there were 1100      
 pupils.                               
  All the teachers had to wear a gown. 
 The pupils wore blazers, caps or      
 berets; senior pupils had different   
 coloured blazers and arm-bands.       
  There was an assembly every day      
 except Mondays (dinner money          
 collection day). The first formers sat
 on benches on the stage. At dinner    
 time everyone sat at their own table. 
 One person would get the dinners and  
 another would serve it out. When the  
 dinner was finished, someone else     
 would fetch dessert.                  </content>
