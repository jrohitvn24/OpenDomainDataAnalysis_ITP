		<content>      Bovingdon is a village on the    
 edge of Hertfordshire near the        
 boundary with Buckinghamshire. It is a
 part of the Dacorum District of       
 Hertfordshire which is centered around
 Hemel Hempstead. Bovingdon is only 3  
 miles from Hemel Hempstead. The       
 population records  normally include  
 the smaller village of Flaunden which 
 is just outside this survey block to  
 the west. At the last census the      
 population was just over 3000, three- 
 quarters of whom were from Bovingdon. 
      The village is on top of a hill  
 between the valleys of the rivers     
 Bulbourne and Chess. Most of the land 
 is divided into fields with a wide    
 variety of crops being grown. Part of 
 the land to the north of the village  
 is taken up with the disused airfield.
