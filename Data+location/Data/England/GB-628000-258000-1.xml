		<content> Block 06280258 is a rural area        
 containing three villages. The land is
 undulating,rising to about 100ft above
 sea level. Land use is primarily      
 agricultural, mainly arable farmland  
 with some grazing and some            
 horticulture. Population is sparse    
 except where concentrated in the three
 villages. Most people work on the     
 land, but an increasing number travel 
 to Ipswich, Woodbridge and Martlesham 
 to work. The school at Parham with    
 about 25 pupils is closing in 1986 and
 children will travel to Eston or      
 Framlingham.  Rural villages in       
 Suffolk suffer from lack of amenities,
 shops and post offices close as the   
 vast majority of the population have  
 cars which they take to larger towns  
 where the shops have cheaper goods.The
 shop and Post Office at Parham have   
 closed within the last 10 years.      </content>
