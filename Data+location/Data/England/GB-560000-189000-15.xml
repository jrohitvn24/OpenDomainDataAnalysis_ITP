		<title>15MY SCHOOLDAY MORNING</title>
		<content> I get up at about five and twenty to  
 eight and put my dressing gown and    
 slippers on and go down to have my    
 breakfast.I usually have Weetabix and 
 toast.When I finish my breakfast, I go
 upstairs to get washed.In the         
 bathroom,I usually have an argument   
 with my sister over the toothpaste.   
 After that I go into my bedroom to get
 dressed.I have my radio on. After     
 getting dressed,I go down to polish my
 shoes.Then I go into the study to do  
 my guitar practice.After that I go to 
 school in my dads Ford Granada 2.8i   
 car.                                  
 When I get into the school playground,
 I hang around with Nigel, Michael,    
 Craig, and Darren. About fifteen      
 minutes after that the whistle goes   
 for us to go in.When we get into      
 school, we do lessons like Maths,     
 English, Project, Art and Storywork.  </content>
