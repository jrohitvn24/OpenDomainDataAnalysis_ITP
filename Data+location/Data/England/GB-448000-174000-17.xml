		<content>    This public house stands on the old
 A34 Oxford-Newbury road at Beedon. As 
 it stands today it shows many         
 alterations. The pub is converted     
 stables whereas the cottages attached 
 to it used to be the original pub.    
 Inside there is little to show of its 
 historic past - unless you go         
 downstairs to the cellar where some of
 the original brick and woodwork can be
 seen. Outside, the old stable-yard has
 changed into a small car-park and     
 delightful children's garden. The     
 landlord also tells of a ghostly rider
 who is occaisionally seen at night    
 coming to the pub - his origins are   
 unknown! Standing on the old A34 ,    
 this could easily be an old coaching  
 inn near the important crossroads at  
 Newbury, where the London-Bristol road
 crossed the Oxford-Winchester road.
