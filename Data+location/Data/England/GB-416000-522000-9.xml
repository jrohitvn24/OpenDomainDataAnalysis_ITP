		<content> Although Steam Engines aren't used any
 more there are shows for them.  There 
 are a lot of preparations before the  
 show, such as cleaning the ashpan and 
 the boilertubes, oiling the engine and
 lighting the fire with diesel and     
 pieces of rag.  The coal bucket is    
 filled with about 250kg of coal and   
 the boiler filled with about 600      
 gallons of water.  The trailer is     
 hooked onto the engine, and more coal 
 is put on the back of the trailer.    
 The tools go on the front of the      
 trailer.  The dynamo belt is taken off
 and the gear cogs are oiled.          
 At the show the engine is parked in a 
 space so that people can see it.      
 Sometimes the driver will play        
 tug-o-war with the children.
