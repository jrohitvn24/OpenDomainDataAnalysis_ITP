		<title>12Helsthorpe Farm, Crafton</title>
		<content>{Helsthorpe Farm, }mentioned in the    
 original Domesday Book, consists of   
 buildings dating from at least 1750,  
 apart from the new storage barns for  
 grain. It is an arable farm with some 
 cattle, housed during the winter at { 
{Crafton Farm. }The{windpump}at this   
 farm is still operational but not in  
 use. It was recently bought by the    
 curators of a museum at Chalfont St.  
 Peter where it will be installed as a 
 working model in the near future. A{  
{water pump}from the dairy at          
 Helsthorpe Farm is now installed at a 
 similar museum at Pitstone, nearby.   
 The owners of{Honeysuckle Lodge,}a    
 recently improved and extended group  
 of buildings, completely walled, both 
 work in Mentmore. They are licensed to
 keep falcons and the falconry is      
 sizeable and noteworthy for the rarity
 of some of the species.               </content>
