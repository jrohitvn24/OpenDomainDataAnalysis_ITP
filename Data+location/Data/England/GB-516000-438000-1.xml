  The Withernwick area is a rural      
 area. It is quite flat with the odd   
 rise or two in the land. That is why  
 you get such good views of the        
 surrounding countryside. There are    
 trees scattered about this area.      
                                       
  The ground is quite fertile and      
 mostly used for growing cereal crops  
 although you will find cattle in some 
 fields.                               
                                       
  The three villages in the area are   
 very close to the East Coast and the  
 seaside town of Hornsea.              
                                       
  The area is very peaceful and so     
 enjoyable for the older generation.
