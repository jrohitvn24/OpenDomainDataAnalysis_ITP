		<content>  The children of Sparsholt Primary    
 School take part in a sponsored       
 walk around Crab Wood each year.The   
 walk first took place in 1975 when    
 the school staff and parents decided  
 that it would be a good way to raise  
 money for the school.                 
  We have to take a sponsor form home  
 and get people to sponsor us for every
 lap we walk.In 1985 the walk took     
 place as usual.Each lap is about half 
 a mile and we do sixteen laps if      
 possible.This year we had to walk     
 through scattered logs and down leafy 
 slopes.At the end of the walk we have 
 two hotdogs and a drink of orange     
 squash.                               
  This year the children in the school 
 raised Â£397.
