		<title>01A Description of N.E.Bolton</title>
		<content> N.E.Bolton consists of hills dissected
 by steepsided valleys running         
 North-South. Since 1950 it has changed
 from a rural area into a suburb of    
 Bolton-forming the edge of the        
 Manchester conurbation.               
 Modern housing has been built on the  
 slopes of the hills,engulfing the old 
 hamlets and the 19th century housing. 
 It has retained its popularity as a   
 residential area because much open    
 space has been preserved and amenities
 have kept pace with growth,although   
 there is a shortage of post and       
 telephone boxes.                      
 The main problem in the future is to  
 decide whether further growth should  
 be allowed.Residents are opposed to it
 because traffic congestion is already 
 great but a recent decision to prevent
 further building was overturned by a  
 government minister.                  </content>
