		<content>    At first sight this appears to be  
 an entirely agricultural area         
 surrounding the small village of      
 Madley. But a short distance SE of the
 village is Madley Earth Satellite     
 Station which is one of the most      
 important Communication Centres in the
 entire world _ not even shown on the  
 current Ordnance Survey Map.          
    Madley village itself surrounds an 
 ancient Parish Church unequalled in   
 the County for its size, symmetry and 
 austere beauty. This beautiful Church 
 now houses the Annual Madley Music    
 Festival. This year 1985, it will be  
 celebrating the European Music Year   
 and International Youth Year.         
    The Roman Road which bisects the   
 Survey Area has a number of           
 interesting features adjacent to it,  
 A Farm Museum, a turkey farm, and  a  
 training ground for lorry drivers.    </content>
