		<title>07Games Survey.</title>
		<content> Our class made a survey of the        
 games we play at breaktimes.We usually
 play one of twenty three games.We     
 discovered that the majority of games 
 only require children in order to play
 the game.The apparatus needed to play 
 the other games is very simple and    
 easy to get,mainly bats,balls and     
 ropes.The most popular game without   
 apparatus is playfights which are most
 popular in the summer because we are  
 allowed on the grass, in winter the   
 most popular game is 'IT'.The most    
 popular ball game is Football,bat and 
 ballgame is wall tennis,and rope game 
 is skipping.Two girls turn the rope.  
 The rest of the girls chant a rhyme   
 and take turns at skipping.Our        
 favourite rhyme is Cowboy Joe.In the  
 winter we play games that warm us     
 up.When it is hot we play on the      
 grass.By Class Two.                   </content>
