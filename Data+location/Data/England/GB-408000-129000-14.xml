		<title>14Farming in Wilton District</title>
		<content> There are 6 farms in the area varying 
 in size from 2,750 acres to 25 acres.A
 small proportion of the land is       
 privately owned but most of it is     
 rented from the Wilton Estate.        
 The smallest farm is a dairy farm with
 12 cows which produce 1000 gallons of 
 milk per year each.Only one farm is   
 exclusively arable, growing mainly    
 wheat and barley. The other farms are 
 mixed, growing crops such as cereals, 
 roots (including potatoes) and hay and
 rearing animals such as beef cattle,  
 sheep, pigs and,in one instance,      
 trout. The largest farm is managed by 
 the farmer with 7 other workers and   
 the smallest by one man with extra    
 help at weekends. All the farmers     
 interviewed enjoyed their work and had
 been farming all their lives,following
 the tradition in their families.
