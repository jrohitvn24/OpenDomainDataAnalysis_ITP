		<content>  Strip Lynchets are found to the south
of Bishopstone.These were used in      
Medieval times. They would have grown  
all sorts of crops on long             
rectangular steps. Now it is just      
grass land.You can see the strip       
lynchets from a few   miles away.      
 The Ridgeway is a public footpath you 
can go for walks and it is mainly grass
land but there are a few fields with   
crops in by the side.It is a very old  
trackI ackway.It was used as a drovers 
road.SheeheeI ep were taken part of    
the way to London.I go on sponsored    
walks on the Ridgeway. The Ridgeway    
links up with major field systems and  
minor track ways leading off the       
Ridgeway from Uffington to the Thames.
