		<title>17EMPLOYMENT FOR CRAWLEY DOWN</title>
		<content> The{majority}of people in Crawley Down
 are{employed.}Nearly three quarters of
 all the households in Crawley Down and
 Turners Hill have only one person in  
{full time employment.}About a quarter 
 have two people in a full time job.   
{Part time employment}occupies one     
 person in about a third of the        
 households in the two villages. The   
 people in Crawley Down work mainly at 
{Gatwick Airport, Crawley, East        
{Grinstead, London}and in the{Croydon  
{area,}in roughly equal amounts. Of the
 people in Turners Hill, similar       
 proportions work in East Grinstead and
 Crawley. Very few people who live in  
 Crawley Down work in Crawley Down.    
 However more than{one third of the    
{people in Turners Hill work in their  
{village.}The reason more people who   
 live in Turners Hill work there is    
 probably because there are more farms.</content>
