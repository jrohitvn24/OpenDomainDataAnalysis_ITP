 Stetchworth.A lady who died in        
 Samantha's bedroom comes back to find 
 her lost daughter.Since Samantha told 
 her that her daughter has moved to    
 Cheveley she has not returned.People  
 who live in the stud next to the      
 churchyard have seen a ghost there.   
 Quite a few people have seen the      
 ghost of an old man in the barn in    
 Alexandra' garden sitting on a chair  
 with a beard and a drink in his       
 hand.In a house at the bottom of the  
 High Street there is a ghost in one of
 the rooms and if a baby is in it ,it  
 will cry at 9am exactly.Helen was     
 getting a drink downstairs at 1.35am

 with a man beside her.I have a ghost  
 in my bedroom called Mhurfy.It is
