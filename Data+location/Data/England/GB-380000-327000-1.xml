		<title>01Eccleshall Introduction</title>
		<content> Once the home of the{Bishops of Lich- 
{field}and still linked with them by   
 its magnificent church, Eccleshall    
 today is a country town of busy shops 
 and one-time coaching inns, its main  
 street protected by a conservation    
 order. The area's populace comprises  
 old farming families, artisans and    
 businessmen; increasingly a commuter  
 base, the town retains a caring comm- 
 unity, mindful of young and old. From 
 Eccleshall's wooded hollow and the    
 protective arm of the{River Sow,      
 fields interspersed with hamlets cover
 the surrounding countryside through   
 which run some quiet leisure drives.  
 Jewel of the landscape is{Copmere,} a 
 small ice-age lake loved by waterfowl 
 and fishermen. Some land is farmed by 
 Council tenants, some by individuals; 
 a proportion still belongs to old est-
 ates with their mellow houses.{       </content>
