		<content>  There are many forms of worship in   
the area; Baptist,Methodist,Catholic   
and Anglican churches are found.There  
is also a Quaker group.Quakers founded 
this school.                           
  The daughter of Thomas Downer,Vicar  
of Charlbury,was born in 1624 and she  
later became the first woman preacher. 
Many people joined the Quaker movement 
after listening to her.Robert Spendlove
who also built the Corner House,gave   
land for a Meeting House in 1779. He   
also donated 100 pounds to start a     
Charlbury School. Robert Spendlove died
in 1822 and is buried in the old       
Meeting House which is now an office.  
Quakers today meet in the Corner House.
