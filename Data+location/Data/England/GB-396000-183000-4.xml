		<content> A lot of people in the area own horses
 It is very interesting because there  
 are a lot of sanderinas and           
 bridlepaths about.Sanderinas are      
 indoor riding schools with sawdust or 
 woodshavings on the ground.They are   
 used for practising jumping,dressage  
 and gymkhana.There are also quite a   
 few stables which people visit to     
 ride.Local shows are very popular and 
 so is hunting.A lot of fields are used
 for horses.The river is also used for 
 hunter trials as an obstacle.Dauntsey 
 horse trials are the most well known  
 of all the local events. Also in the  
 area is a stud farm. A stud farm is   
 the proper name for breeding stables. 
 There is a famous stallion there      
 called Michaelangelo. Lots of people  
 bring their mares to breed from him.
