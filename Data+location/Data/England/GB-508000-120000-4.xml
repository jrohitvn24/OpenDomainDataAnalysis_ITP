		<content>  Despite the disappearance of elms,   
 trees abound.   Woodshill Copse in the
 south has oak, beech, chestnut, birch,
 ash, whitebeam, sycamore, poplar, fir,
 hawthorn.  There are hazels, willows, 
 hollies and ancient hedges.  At Walnut
 Tree Cottage (Gay Street) the walnut  
 died but is replaced.  Gaywood boasts 
 an old mulberry tree.  Hungerhill has 
 yews, acacias, and avenues of pines.  
  Deer roam freely everywhere and are a
 problem to some farmers and gardeners.
 Badgers are known, foxes plentiful and
 rabbits multiplying fast.  English and
 French partridges are native;  snipe, 
 Canada geese and wild duck regularly  
 visit farm ponds.  Several barn owls  
 are reported, also a sparrowhawk and  
 occasional buzzards circling high.    
 Gaystreet Farm has a Jerusalem donkey;
 two others at Harbolets give rides to 
 mentally/physically disabled children.</content>
