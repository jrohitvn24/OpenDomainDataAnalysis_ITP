		<content>Our 4X3 km square consists of parts    
of Rotherhithe Millwall,The Isle of    
dogs,Deptford and Greenwich areas are  
given over to the housing apart from   
a section containing Greenwich Park    
.The other areas are largly docks and  
wharfs associated with the river       
T}hames.The area is rich in history    
having been a center of British ship   
building for centuries.Deptford and    
Greenwich especially have a rich and   
varied history. The latter area is one 
of Londons most popular tourist        
attractions.In recent times much of    
the traditional work in and around     
the docks has disappeared and          
unemployment in the area is high.The   
area is very rich and varied in peoples
and culture Afro-Carribean and         
Vietnamese forming two large           
communities in the area.
