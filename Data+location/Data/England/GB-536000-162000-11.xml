		<title>11MY TYPICAL DAY</title>
		<content> A typical day for me would be to get  
 up at 6.45am .When I'm up I make      
 my bed, then I get dressed. At about  
 7.15am I  go downstairs and have      
 my bowl of either Cocoa Pops or Rice  
 Krispies. At 7.30am I  brush my teeth 
 and wash my face. After that I        
 put my coat on and get my bag ready   
 and wait for my friend to             
 call for me to walk to school.        
 When we get to school we play a game  
 in the playground before doing our    
 work. At 10.20 we have our assembly   
 which is followed by a short playtime 
 which ends at 11.00. We  work for     
 one hour, then we have dinner then we 
 have a playtime until 1.10pm. We      
 work solid until 3.10pm after that we 
 have 5 minutes of story then at 3.15pm
 we go home. At the end of the day I   
 will go to bed at 9.30pm.
