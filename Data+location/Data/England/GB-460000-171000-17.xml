		<title>17VILLAGE SURVEY</title>
		<content> A survey was carried out by Englefield
 Primary School which found that most  
 households had televisions and radios 
 and in their kitchens they had        
 cookers,'fridges and washing machines.
 A large number had freezers which     
 could be used to freeze vegetables    
 grown in the sizeable gardens the     
 majority of houses have. Most         
 households owned a car. Those who     
 relied on the bus service on the main 
 road found it inadequate. Clubs and   
 sports played a fairly large part in  
 Englefield. There is a popular social 
 club, a football and a cricket club,  
 both of which have grounds. Villagers 
 are able to use the Benyon's swimming 
 pool in the Summer. A recent growth in
 Church activities, such as the        
 Mother's Union, has increased         
 membership. Some went regularly,      
 others only on special occasions.     </content>
