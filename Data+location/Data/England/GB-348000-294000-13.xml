		<title>13COMMUTING FROM CARDINGTON</title>
		<content>    I drive most weekdays to my office 
 in Telford 19 miles away. Why do I do 
 it? My company established an         
 engineering division in Telford 7     
 years ago.I joined the company a year 
 later and my wife and I,moving from   
 Kent,had to make the choice where to  
 live.I had previously spent over an   
 hour each way travelling to London so 
 I decided to look for a home within a 
 radius of 25/30 minutes.Having lived  
 for the previous 9 years in the       
 rolling Weald of Kent,we quickly came 
 to the conclusion that the flat plain 
 north of Telford was uninteresting;we 
 did not want to live in a town,so our 
 search narrowed to the area of the    
 Wenlock Edge.Cardinton caught my eye  
 one dark night in March.Later acquain-
 tance of the church,pub,and village   
 school-then still open-confirmed our  
 view it would be a good place to live.</content>
