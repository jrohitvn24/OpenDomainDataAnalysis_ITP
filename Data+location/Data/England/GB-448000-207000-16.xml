		<title>16Twining Brothers Shop Oxford</title>
		<content>We interviewed Mr Twining.He has lived 
in Summertown all his life.His father  
and his uncle owned a chain of shops in
Oxford.The shop,Twining Brothers,was   
opposite South Parade where the cycle  
shop is now.It was a grocer's shop and 
was also a great place for gossip.     
  It was open from 8am-6pm Monday to   
Wednesday.Thursday was a half day,on   
Friday and Saturday it closed at 8pm   
and it was closed on Sundays.          
  They sold biscuits,soap,vegetables   
and even wine and spirits.Tea and sugar
came in large sacks and was weighed    
into bags.                             
  Boys delivered orders around the area
on their push bikes,(later on they had 
a van).                                
  The shop closed down in 1966 because 
it was old fashioned and it could not  
compete with the supermarkets.
