 The Park is a very attractive centre  
 for many activities such as Country   
 Fairs,Treasure Trails,Nature Trails   
 and Equestrian Events.Activities for  
 children are usually held during      
 school holidays and are very popular. 
 In the Park there are many different  
 gardens such as Butterfly,Bee,and Bird
 gardens.To encourage wild life in the 
 area school children have planted     
 special plants such as:Ox Eye Daisy,  
 Holly,Hazel,Docks,Wild                
 Carrot,Teasle,Field Poppy and Thyme.  
 Future plans for the Park include
