		<title>01TREGONY GENERAL SURVEY</title>
		<content>(Our survey covered only 2/3 of the    
actual village)                        
The 104 pre 1950 properties of Tregony 
are mainly sited along the wide Fore   
Street and Tregony Hill.Terraced,stone 
built,they are unified by scale and    
architectural simplicity.              
  The main thoroughfare descends a     
spur ending abruptly at the R.Fal where
a bridging point is a focus of five    
roads.The village core's appearance    
has changed little since the 1870s but 
a major convenience was main water and 
sewage,established in 1963.            
  The pull of Truro's catchment area   
has decreased village facilities.Within
the past 25 years 4 shops and a garage 
have closed but Spar,Central Stores,   
Post Office and 1 front room shop      
(Wheelers) continue.Since 1975 a       
butchers has been reestablished and    
significantly a furrier,(see page 2)   </content>
