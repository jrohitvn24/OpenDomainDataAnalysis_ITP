		<content> The area is largely agricultural being
 mainly grassland with some cultivated 
 crops grown.  There are four villages 
 each with its own primary school and  
 one or two shops.  The nearest        
 shopping centre is Ilkeston and the   
 nearest large towns are Derby and     
 Nottingham.  The primary schools      
 feed                                  
 a number of comprehensive schools all 
 of which are outside the D block.  The
 largest village, West Hallam has grown
 recently due to the building of many  
 new houses, but the other three       
 villages remain small with a strong   
 sense of community.  There is no      
 industry in the area now but there are
 many small disused coal mines and some
 of the oldest houses in Stanley Common
 were built for coal miners.
