		<title>07LUDFORD _ SUMMARY</title>
		<content> A Linear Village along A631 Rotherham 
 to Louth road, 80% of village being in
 this Grid area. Main street,Magna Mile
 follows this road and is the line of  
 Ancient Salters Way, a Trans Wolds    
 trackway from Salt Pans at Grainthorpe
 to Lincoln. The Viking Way Footpath   
 from Oakham, Rutland to the Humber    
 follows this route and is used by many
 walkers. Village nestles in dip on top
 of Wolds and from adjacent heights    
 appears well wooded but this is an    
 illusion, many trees having been fell_
 _ed for wartime airfield so that cold 
 winds prevail. River Bain rises in    
 Ludford and is mentioned in the late  
 Poet Laureate, John Betjeman's poem 'A
 Lincolnshire Tale'. The Church, School
 &amp; a Pub are in next Grid area_ Page 7.
 A compact community of just over 300  
 with local small firms providing jobs 
 &amp; there is good social activity.      </content>
