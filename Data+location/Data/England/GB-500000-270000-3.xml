The types of houses built in our area  
are very varied. New estates built     
recently can be found at RANDS WAY and 
MANOR FARM. Older terraced housing,    
built around 1900, can be found in the 
PARK ROAD, LAWSON STREET and HILL      
STREET area. PARK AVENUE is an estate  
of council houses owned by the East    
Northants District Council. There is a 
mixture of detached, semi-detached and 
terraced houses.Most houses are built  
of brick and some have breeze blocks to
give better insulation. Some of the    
older houses in THORPE STREET are built
with stone. Some people have changed   
the appearance of their houses by      
putting stone cladding, which is       
imitation stone, over the bricks.      
Others have sprayed a tyrolean mix onto
the walls. There are no thatched       
cottages in this area of RAUNDS.       </content>
