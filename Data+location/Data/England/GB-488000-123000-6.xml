 During the Second World War R.A.F.    
 personnel suffering from pulmonary    
 disorders were flown from all over the
 world to King Edward VII Hospital for 
 treatment.  Since the war, the R.A.F. 
 has maintained a{"Chest Unit"}at the  
 hospital, though this has now been    
 reduced to seven beds on Portal Ward. 
 Patients are still sent by the R.A.F. 
 from different parts of the world,    
 many of them being young airmen       
 suffering from asthma. An R.A.F. Wing 
 Commander is in charge of the unit and
 he is also involved in research at the
 hospital.  An R.A.F. Sergeant is also 
 resident, and he deals with all the   
 paperwork.                            
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
