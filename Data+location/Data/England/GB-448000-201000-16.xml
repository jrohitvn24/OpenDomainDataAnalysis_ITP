		<title>16Houses - Boars Hill area</title>
		<content>                                       
   The houses on Boars Hill itself are 
mostly large detatched properties      
surrounded by large gardens and woods. 
Most of these houses have been built   
within the past 90 years and are       
constructed mainly of brick with tiled 
roofs. In the 19th century there was a 
small brick and tile works opposite the
Fox Inn but there is no trace of it    
left today.                            
   The Houses in Bayworth are much     
smaller and consist of detatched, semi-
-detatched and terraced houses, many of
them owned by the Vale of the White    
Horse District Council, a typical rent 
in 1985 is 20 pounds per week.  During 
the review a house was sold on Boars   
Hill for 135,000 pounds and one in     
Bayworth for 60,000 pounds.
