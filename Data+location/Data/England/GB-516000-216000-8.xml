		<title>08Farming in Kimpton</title>
		<content>  The farming in this area is mostly   
 arable. There are also some sheep,    
 poultry and cattle.Modern machinery is
 used and pulled by tractors,which have
 a cab.Many drivers wear ear-muffs.All 
 the work in the fields is done by     
 machine e.g. harvesting by a combine- 
 harvester;baling of the straw by a    
 baler;a mowing machine is used for    
 cutting grass for hay and silage.     
  The Bury Farm is two farms           
 together.They have two generators.    
  Hall Farm is 100 yards behind the    
 school.Sometimes we see a helicopter  
 or a small aeroplane spraying the     
 crops.Pollution sometimes causes a    
 problem on surrounding land.          
  Both farms grow wheat,oats,barley,   
 field beans,oil-seed rape and         
 potatoes. They use a rotation system.
