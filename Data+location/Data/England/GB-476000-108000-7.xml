		<title>07Racton Tower</title>
		<content> Racton Tower was built in 1770 by a   
 man called Lord Halifax. In 1771 it   
 was used by smugglers for signalling  
 ships at sea. Racton Tower is situated
 near the Hants Border a few miles east
 of Rowlands Castle Station. It was    
 errected at a cost of Â£10,000 pounds. 
 In 1771 it is said that Lord Halifax  
 hung himself in Racton Tower. It was a
 recognised landmark from the channel  
 for vessels wishing to enter          
 Chichester, or Lanchester Harbours.   
 Recently it has been fenced in because
 of falling bricks but the fence was   
 demolished some time ago. You can gain
 direct access to the Tower by a public
 bridle-path which passes it.
