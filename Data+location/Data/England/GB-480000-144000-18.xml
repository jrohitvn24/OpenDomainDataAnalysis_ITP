		<title>18Downing Street, Farnham.</title>
		<content>{Downing Street}is one of Farnham's    
 oldest streets and was , at one time, 
 the main thoroughfare from north of   
 Farnham to the south. Travellers      
 crossed the{River Wey}near a sarcen   
 stone marking its shallowest point.   
 About 120 years ago South St. took    
 over as the major route south.        
{Today}Downing St. is a bustling street
 lined with small shops almost all of  
 which are privately owned. There are  
 retailers of toys, fabrics, furniture,
 musical instruments, foodstuffs,      
 cameras and clothing (most notably at 
 Number Ten). Estate and travel agents 
 abound and at the corner of Ivy Lane, 
 on the former site of the Al Arak     
 toothbrush factory, stands Farnham    
 Conservative Club.                    
 A number of attractive ,ancient lanes 
 lead off Downing St. in the direction 
 of St.Andrews Parish Church.          </content>
