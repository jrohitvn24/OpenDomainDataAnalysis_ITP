		<title>05St.Ignatius Church</title>
		<content> This church of England is 96 years    
 old.About 120 people go to the church 
 each Sunday,half live nearby whie     
 others come from  different parts of  
 town.The bell ringers are from the    
 congrgation.The Sunday service begins 
 at 10.10 and ends at 12.00:they sing  
 hymns and say prayers.The church has  
 one vicar and a deacon is joining in  
 June 1985.Behind the church is the    
 three year old vicarage which is in   
 keeping with the new housing estate   
 nerby.Alongside the church is a new   
 group of shops called St.Ignatius     
 Precinct.Volunteers from the          
 congregation display flowers and keep 
 the church clean.A pilgrimage to      
 Walsingham,Norfolk is made every year 
 as 'Our Lady' was seen here.At one    
 time the church doors were left open  
 during the day-but now,due to         
 vandalism they are kept locked.       </content>
