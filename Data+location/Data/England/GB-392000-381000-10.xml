 The countryside around Higher Poynton 
 is partly wooded and partly open      
 grassland.There are very few people   
 living in the area and so much        
 wildlife can be seen,both animals and 
 birds.Near the entrance to Lyme Park  
 we saw many grey squirrels and rabbits
 and many birds such as bluetits robins
 blackbirds and magpies.In the newly   
 made Elmwood Nature Reserve a variety 
 of creatures have made their home     
 including squirrels nuthatches, a fox 
 was seen in the area too.Many types of
 ducks can be seen on the canal.We also
 discovered frogspawn and tadpoles in  
 pools on middlewood walkway.Many wild 
 flowers can be found in the wooded    
 areas,such as bluebells, cow parsley  
 wild garlic and campion.              </content>
