		<title>01Introduction to Leighfield</title>
		<content> The area covered by this block is     
 known as Leighfield. The majority of  
 the block lies within the old County  
 of Rutland(now Leicestershire) and    
 lies to the north of the A47 Leicester
 to Peterborough road. To the northeast
 lies Rutland Water and Oakham.        
 The county boundary runs from north to
 south through the west of the block.  
 The River Chater bisects the block    
 running from west to east through the 
 valley.                               
 No villages lie within the block. The 
 area is given over almost totally to  
 farming and the few houses within the 
 area are the homes of farmers or are  
 now deserted.                         
 The block has a very poor road supply 
 most of the farms are only accessible 
 via single track roads.
