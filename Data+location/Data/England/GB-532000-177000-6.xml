The area consists widely still of the housing blocks which existed in the 1980s. These housing blocks are no longer in such neglect as they were, in fact, these blocks prove to be increasingly desirable to young professionals. This is due to a wave of wealth sweeping across the area south-eastwards from London Bridge. West of Tower Bridge Road there is evidence of cafe culture, swanky bars and leafy parks interspersed with the old flavour of the area with its warehouses which have, in the most part been refurbished for use as studios.&lt;br />&lt;br /> Moving east, there is still a strong show of the old East End with the Pie and Jellied eel shops and Millwall Support. &lt;br />&lt;br />There still remains, although rather diluted, a sense of community, something which could in the future be under threat with being in the shadow of The Shard. This is not necessarily an unwelcome change, putting this area on the map and fueling an improvement in public services.   &lt;br />
