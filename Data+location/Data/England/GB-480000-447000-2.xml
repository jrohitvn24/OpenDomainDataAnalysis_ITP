		<content> The vast majority of interviewees     
 believed that their area had changed, 
 it had grown attracting more people,  
 houses and shops. They found these    
 changes reasonable but were irritated 
 by the increased volume of traffic and
 consequent parking restrictions. Most 
 interviewees believed Pocklington     
 people to be friendly, representing a 
 cross section of types and social     
 classes of people found in England    
 today. The majority had not taken part
 in any special festival or event      
 during the last year, of those who had
 most were connected with their church 
 or with agricultural shows. Save for  
 supposed ghosts at The Feathers Hotel 
 and 'Penny Arcadia Museum', no unusual
 beliefs or customs were mentioned or  
 known of by those interviewed. Most   
 peoples favourite place in the area   
 was Burnby Hall Gardens.              </content>
