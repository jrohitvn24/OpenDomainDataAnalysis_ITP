 second. Many of his clocks are in the

  Tompion's cottage still stands on    
 Ickwell green.Built in the 16th       
 century it has very low ceilings      
 because people were smaller in those  
 days.The interior walls are made of   
 lath &amp; plaster and the exterior walls 
 are made of different materials.It has
 one wall at the back of the building  
 which dates to 1700.The house is a    
 private residence and is not open to  
 the public.                           </content>
