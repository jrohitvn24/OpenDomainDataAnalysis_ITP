		<content> From our survey of the people of      
 Hackforth we found that the majority  
 of workers are employed locally.16 out
 of the 38 employed are farm workers.  
 Some of the women in the village are  
 also employed locally as cooks or     
 caretakers.Many who travel between 5  
 and 15 miles worked in shops as       
 assistants.The builders and gardeners 
 travelled from place to place.There   
 are 2 teachers who travel by car to   
 work and 2 wagon drivers,one works at 
 Catterick,the other works at          
 Middlesbrough.A civil servant who     
 works at Pontefract travels farthest. 
 Amongst the other occupations are a   
 Doctor,a Restaurant manageress and an 
 agricultural miller.There is also a   
 stud farm and a haulage contractor in 
 the area.At least 12 of the households
 asked have retired people in them.
