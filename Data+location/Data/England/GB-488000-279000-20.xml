		<title>20Country walk: Kettering N.E.</title>
		<content>  Kettering Borough Council has        
produced a number of leaflets entitled 
"If you feel like going for a short    
walk...".  Number 6 is within our area 
and guides the walker through the      
lovely valley of the River Ise.        
  Here the built up townscape ends     
quite abruptly with Grange Estate to   
the east of the river.  Allotments and 
a wide open space lead to the river    
bank.   This is in really stark        
contrast to the meadows and trees on   
the other side of the valley towards   
the village of Warkton.                
                                       
The data for the block was collected   
by children of Kettering's Avondale    
Junior School with Miss S.Grimes, Mrs  
E.Cross and Mr.C.H.Jervis(Headmaster). 
Computer pages were written by Deena   
Wilson, Mirranda Abraham and Mr.Jervis.
