		<content>{Traffic Offences.}                    
 Cars and lorries have been speeding   
 along New Road in Hedon.The police    
 have tried to stop this by keeping a  
 check on the speed of passing         
 cars.Three times a week a{speed gun   
{trap} is set up in the bus shelter so 
 that the police can catch offenders or
 deter drivers from driving too fast.  
 The speed limit is 30mph.             
{                                      
{Crime Detection Rate.}                
 Hedon does not have a major crime     
 problem.Minor crimes such as burglary 
 vandalism and assaults do occur.Many  
 crimes are solved because Hedon has a 
 high crime detection rate.In March'85 
 it was 41%,in April'85 it was 50%.    
 Hedon is a good place to live because 
 not many crimes or offences are       
 committed here.
