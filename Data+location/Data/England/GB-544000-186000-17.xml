		<title>17Types of Housing in Ilford.</title>
		<content> We have looked at{housing}in the Seven
 Kings area for things which tell the  
 age of houses, like a footscraper on  
 houses built in the 19th century.     
 We found that a lot of houses did not 
 have footscrapers so their ages are   
 unknown, but the houses to the left of
 Meads Lane seemed older than those on 
 the right. We guessed that the older  
 ones were built before 19OO.          
 All{houses}were teraced but the end of
 terrace house usually had a garage    
 behind it. Also most end of terrace   
 houses had large{back gardens.        
 Most houses are privately owned; some 
 of the larger houses have been        
 converted into{self contained flats.
