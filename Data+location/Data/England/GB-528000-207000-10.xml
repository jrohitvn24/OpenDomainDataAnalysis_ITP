		<content>  The Bakers Arms is a popular country 
 pub, part of the{McMullen Brewery.    
 This local firm is based in Hertford. 
 The pub employs 14 staff, including   
 the boy who "bottles up".             
  The pub only sells traditional ales, 
 and the most popular beer is 'AK'. The
 sale of{'Pub Grub'}has become         
 increasingly important, and food such 
 as Steak and Kidney Pie, and chips;   
 and, a 'special' three times a week   
 are served.                           
  Customers are fairly evenly divided  
 between locals and outsiders.{Sunday  
{lunchtime is the busiest period,}and  
 families are attracted by the garden. 
  Social events such as barbeques are  
 organised, as are inter-pub darts,    
 crib, and dominoes.                   
  As to the future, the publican would 
 like{more flexible opening hours,     
 according to public demand in the area</content>
