		<title>08The Church in Risby</title>
		<content>  St. Giles church is of flint         
construction with a fine example of a  
pre-Saxon round tower. The scratchdial 
on the tower is possibly seventeenth   
century. The interior of the church    
reflects many of the changes that      
have occurred within the ecclesiastical
buildings throughout the Suffolk area  
over the last nine hundred years.      
There are still examples of the        
twelfth century wall paintings, which  
though faded are still attractive.     
The stone font, possibly dating from   
the fifteenth century, shows           
evidence of having been plastered      
over to hide the ornamentation,        
probably in the seventeenth century.   
The church contains a finely carved    
wooden rood screen and a door to the   
now defunct rood loft.
