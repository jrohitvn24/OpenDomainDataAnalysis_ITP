		<content>Hornby lies on a North-South axis. The 
main road through the village is the   
A683. It is called Main Street within  
the village boundaries.The houses on   
Main Street were built between the     
17th. and 19th. Centuries, many are    
stone built terraced houses. Since the 
end of the Second World War, modern    
detatched  and semi-detatched houses   
have been built. The first development 
was that of Hornby Bank and Royal Oak  
Meadow at the North end of the village.
Secondly, Monteagle Drive and Stanley  
Drive were built to the East of Main   
Street. In the late 1960's Post Horse  
Lane and Hornby Hall Close (both       
cul-de-sacs) were built to the West of 
Main Street. The latest development,   
currently nearing completion, is that  
of Lunesdale Court 1 km. SW of Hornby. 
The old Rural District Council Offices 
are being converted into family homes. </content>
