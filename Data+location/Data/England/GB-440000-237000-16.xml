		<title>16Lower Tadmarton Village (2)</title>
		<content>The small windows are so that in the   
summer it is cooler and in the winter  
they are warmer. So it saved the people
lot of money.                          
  It is a very quiet little hamlet     
hardly anything happens there. The     
{population of Lower Tadmarton is 56}. 
Lower Tadmarton is really part of      
Tadmarton village which is half a mile 
up the road. There are 3 farms in Lower
Tadmarton, Camp Farm, High Meadow Farm 
and Lower Tadmarton Farm. The brook    
runs into the moat of Broughton Castle 
and then runs into Sor brook.          
  Lower Tadmarton is the kind of place 
people dream of living in. It is a     
peaceful place hardly any cars go      
through it. It has {beautiful rural    
scenery} and there are lots of lovely  
paths to walk along.
