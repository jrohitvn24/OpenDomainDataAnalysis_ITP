		<content>     Mavis Enderby is a small village  
 on the outskirts of Spilsby. It has an
 old church and a village green. I     
 think it used to have a blacksmith as 
 I have found many horseshoes and tiny 
 clay pipes in the vicinity.           
     The village is surrounded by farm 
 land on which there are four main     
 farms. These are called Eastfield,    
 Southfield, Highfield and Harrison    
 farms. The buildings of Harrison farm 
 have now become a large store house   
 for machines and are sometimes used   
 for disco dances.                     
     Mavis Enderby has a population of 
 about 100 persons, many of whom are   
 senior citizens. It is a nice place to
 live, rather quiet but it can be fun  
 in the winter.                        
     My hobby is dancing and for this I
 have to travel regularly to Skegness; 
 a distance of l6 miles.               </content>
