		<title>12Great Corby</title>
		<content>   In Great Corby we met a most        
 interesting lady who had lived in the 
 village for 66 years,she was 93 years 
 old.                                  
   She has lived 47 years in the same  
 house which was built about 1800 A.D. 
   Once she lived in the Toll Box,a    
 cottage at the end of the viaduct.    
   She has seen great changes in so    
 many things since she was young. After
 the general strike of 1926 A.D.most   
 people were poor but they formed      
 choirs,drama groups,a tennis club and 
 the W.I. had just started.She, like   
 many other young women was very good  
 at knitting,sewing and crochet work.  
 Most people now, she thought,did      
 little with their spare time except   
 watch television.Not enough young     
 people have hobbies or interests and  
 many have no work to go to.
