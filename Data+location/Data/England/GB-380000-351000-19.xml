		<title>19A school day in Talke</title>
		<content>When we go to school in the morning we 
have a short playtime until 9a.m. then 
we line up. From lines we walk up to   
the school and enter. We read or work  
for a while, then four people go into  
the hall and do jobs before assembly.  
After assembly English until playtime  
which is about fifteen minutes long.   
When we come back into school we       
usually do mathematics.At twelve o     
clock we either go home to have our    
dinner or stay for school meals.In the 
afternoon we do painting or drawing or 
craft.Or we sometimes do Science for   
example the other day we had to draw a 
bike explain about the parts on a      
bike.Sometimes we do History in the    
afternoon, the last time we talked     
about weaving and spinning.Also we do  
Geography.There is a playtime at 2.30  
and we might do P.E. after.At quarter  
to four we go home.                    </content>
