		<title>16Mischievous Night</title>
		<content>     Mischievous Night is the 4th of   
 November, the night before Bonfire    
 Night.  On Mischievous Night groups of
 local children go out and play tricks 
 on friends and neighbours. There is no
 definite reason why it is celebrated  
 it is just a local custom.            
    Children go out in the evening and 
 put milk bottles in front of peoples  
 houses so the owners trip over them.  
 Also the empty dustbins into gardens  
 and throw dead leaves through letter  
 boxes.  Some of the tricks are more   
 silly like rubbing soap or treacle    
 onto peoples windows or car           
 windscreeens.                         
     Children always look forward to   
 Mischief night themselves, but in the 
 morning there are a lot of angry      
 neighbours and broken milk bottles.
