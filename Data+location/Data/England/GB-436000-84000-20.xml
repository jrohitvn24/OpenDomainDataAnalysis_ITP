		<content>  This survey was taken in the form of 
 two visits to{BROOK,}by minibus.Seven 
 girls collected the information in two
 separate groups.                      
  One group walked along the ridge of  
{COMPTON DOWNS,}while the other        
 explored the area around{DUNSBURY     
{FARM.}Later people were questioned on 
 their views and feelings of living in 
 the area.                             
  After the information was collected  
 the groups compared them and began to 
 write about the area.                 
  We found Brook to be a typical rural 
 district, which we enjoyed            
 investigating.
