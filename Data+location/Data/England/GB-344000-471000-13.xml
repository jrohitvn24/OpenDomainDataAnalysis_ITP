		<content>{The Crystal Well}in Warton parish near
 the three cottages at Crag Foot on the
 left of the road to Carnforth was the 
 source of water until after the last  
 war. The spring was of some depth,    
 a bucket being lowered and filled. It 
 was never known to run dry. Sadly     
 lorries began to use the water for    
 cleaning, no doubt contaminating the  
 pure supply. Now little can be seen of
 the crystal waters.                   
{Crag Foot Chimney}brick built and in  
 the garden of the cottage was the saw 
 mill furnace for Leighton Hall estate,
 making gates etc. The smithy was where
 the first house on the right of the   
 crag road now stands. A man who built 
 St. John's Church built it for his own
 use during his stay. It reverted to   
 the Gillow estate.
