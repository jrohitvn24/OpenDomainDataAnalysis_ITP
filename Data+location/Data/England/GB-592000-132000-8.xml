		<title>08The Village Green</title>
		<content> The{green}is in the centre of the     
 village. It has always been part of   
 the village,but used to be bigger than
 it is now.The{roads}around the green  
 would have been dirt tracks, and much 
 smaller than they are now.There would 
 have been far fewer{houses}round the  
 green.There is a{pump}on the green.   
 This would have been used by the      
 people of the village as a main source
 of water.People would have{grazed     
 sheep and cattle on the green.As well 
 as helping local farmers,this would   
 keep the grass short,as there were no 
 lawn mowers .Now the green is used for
 cricket,football and rounders matches.
 Children play on the swings and       
 slides.People walk their dogs there.It
 is still the centre of the village,   
 although the pump is no longer used.
