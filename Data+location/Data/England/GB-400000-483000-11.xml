 crafsman he is Mr Wilkinson.          
 Mr Wilkinson started woodwork at      
 school age but has been working on his
 own for 15 years.                     
 The most expensive wood is Indian     
 Rosewood.Pine is usualy the cheapest  
 wood.                                 
 Both Oak and Chestnut are the same in 
 grain.Oak usually has the same pattern
 repeated but Chestnut is streaky.     
 He recently made all the furniture for
 a church in Thornaby,all in Ash.It    
 took him five and a half months.      
 It usually takes him 5 days to make a 
 moderate sized table.The most unusual 
 thing he has been asked to make is    
 Scotch Hands which are butter pats.   
 Teak is an oily wood so it is used for
 garden funiture.                      
 You can varnish,fume in ammonia and   
 stain wood to get a different effect  </content>
