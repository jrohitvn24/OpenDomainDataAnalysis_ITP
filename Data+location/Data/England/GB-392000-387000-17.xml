		<content>     We went to visit Brook House farm 
 on Bean Leach Road.There was a date on
 the farmhouse saying{1849.            
     Nowadays because of the importance
 of{horse riding}in the leisure of many
 people places like this are used to   
{graze horses}and not produce much     
 food.There are{60}horses.The lady said
 that her favourite animals are the    
{goats}because they give milk and eat  
 many weeds.                           
     There were{7 dogs and cat.}The    
 farmer owns{160 acres of land.}There  
 were{two old sheep and two lambs      
 together. We were allowed to pick up  
 the lambs after the lady had shown us 
 how to do it properly.                
     The farm had a{thoroughbred horse 
 which was the foal of a{Derby         
{winner.}It was worth a few thousand   
 pounds. They do not use dogs to guard 
 the farm they use{geese.              </content>
