		<title>07THE EGG-WELL AT ASHENHURST</title>
		<content>     The egg-well is an isolated       
building found in the corner of a      
farmers field at Ashenhurst. It has    
undergone many redevelopments. Its name
is derived from the eliptical shape of 
the well. The well has recently been   
covered with a form of shelter built   
from modern day housing bricks.        
     A particularly interesting feature
of the well is its surrounding stone   
plinth which has a Latin inscription   
chiselled into the rock meaning        
"Whatever of inward ailings may be     
yours a thousand such healing water    
cures".
