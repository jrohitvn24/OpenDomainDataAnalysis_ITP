		<title>11A DAY IN THE LIFE OF LISA</title>
		<content> I get up in the morning at about 7.30 
 a.m. I usually have toast and a cup of
 coffee for my breakfast. Afterwards I 
 have a wash and get dressed.          
 I set off for school at 8.20 and      
 sometimes go to the shop on the way   
 for some sweets. I arrive at school at
 8.35 where I meet my friends. We      
 usually talk or play skipping until   
 the bell goes at 9.55.                
 After Assembly we usually have        
 Mathematics and then English. At      
 playtime I get a bag of crisps from   
 the school shop. In the summer we can 
 go on the school field to play so we  
 bring our own things to have a game of
 rounders. You are not allowed to play 
 ball games in the playground because  
 it is too dangerous.                  
 I stay at school for my dinner. Today 
 we had chips, beans and sausage       
 followed by sponge pudding.           </content>
