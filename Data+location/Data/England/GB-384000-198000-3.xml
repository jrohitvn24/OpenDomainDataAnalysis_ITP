		<content>     {Nailsworth}has a wide range of   
 shops but lacks {fashion }and{shoe }  
 shops.It has improved from previous   
 years as there are more shops and     
 better facilities, although more      
 telephone boxes and bus stops are     
 needed.There is a {Dentist, Doctor's  
{surgery,and a fire and police station 
 There is a{library}in old market with 
 a wide selection of books.Children's  
 activities are frequently held in the 
 Mortimer rooms.                       
   People are pleased with the free car
 parking, but feel the{bus service}    
 could be improved with cheaper        
 fares,cleaner buses,which run more    
 frequently and which also operate more
 around the small estates.Nailsworth   
 does however lack a {Sports centre}and
{Swimming pool. }On the whole people   
 enjoy the facilities of{Nailsworth.
