		<content>  The{Convent}of Poor Clare's is       
 situated on the A27 just east of      
 Arundel. It stands in 4 acres of land 
 and presently houses 43 nuns. Their   
 ages range from 22 to 90 and most have
 entered orders by vocation. Poor      
 Clare's is a{closed Order}related to  
 the{Franciscans}and with similar vows 
 of poverty.                           
  Some nuns work at the printing press,
 others at gardening, husbandry,       
 vestment making, calligraphy,         
 catering, craftwork etc., which       
 contributes to the upkeep of the      
 Convent. The nuns use their abilities 
 to try to keep the Convent            
 self-contained. Some prepare the food 
 and there is an infirmary for the sick
 and aged.                             
  They may have 6 free days each year  
 when they need not perform their      
 duties and they may receive visitors. </content>
