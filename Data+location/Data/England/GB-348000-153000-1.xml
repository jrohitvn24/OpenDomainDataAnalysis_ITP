		<title>01PREFACE- THE MENDIP PLATEAU</title>
		<content>  The block is part of the Mendip      
 limestone plateau, most of it at least
 250 metres above sea level. It is     
 situated at the very top of Cheddar   
 Gorge and is cut by the valleys:_     
 Velvet Bottom, Longwood &amp; the Gorge.  
  Arable farming forms the base of the 
 local economy, usually wheat &amp; barley 
 growing. Sheep grazing, dairy &amp; pig   
 breeding also occur. There is an      
 outdoor activity centre at            
 Charterhouse and an army firing range 
 at Yoxter. This remote area has few   
 main roads or amenities and is popular
 for outdoor recreation. Important     
 conservation areas are included within
 the block. Settlement consists of     
 isolated farms.
