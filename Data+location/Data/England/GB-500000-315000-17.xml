		<title>17RAILWAY ELECTRIFICATION</title>
		<content> A 3.3km section of the London to Edin-
 burgh railway cuts across our block.  
 The line is being electrified, and    
 some bridges over the line are being  
 rebuilt to make room for the overhead 
 cables (which will make the railway   
 line much more obtrusive).            
  Work has already begun on the smaller
 farm bridges.                         
  A few months ago workmen put up a    
 temporary bridge. Then they took the  
 sides of the old bridge down, and took
 as much of the surface from the top as
 they could. Then (late at night, after
 the last train) they covered the track
 with sleepers and blew the rest of the
 bridge up. Now they are making the    
 pillars for the new bridge.           
  Careby road bridge was to have been  
 demolished and rebuilt without a temp-
 orary replacement until public opinion
 forced a rethink.                     </content>
