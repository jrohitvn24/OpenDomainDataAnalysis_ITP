		<content> There has been a gradual{change}in the
 farming pattern of the district in the
 last 20 years. Hops,which once were   
 very common,now are only found in one 
 or two fields and the oast houses have
 been converted to housing.{Orchards   
 too are diminishing,both in acreage   
 and in the size of tree.{Arable crops 
 such as wheat have replaced the       
 orchards that have been grubbed.      
 Others have had their large spreading 
 traditional trees replaced by smaller 
 but easier to pick varieties.{Dairy}  
{farming }is now non-existent in this  
 area. The last dairy farm was given   
 over to arable in 1984. There is still
 a good deal of{grazing}for both sheep 
 and horses but the trend is generally 
 towards arable,fortunately without too
 much hedge-row removal. There are two 
 large scale{egg production units.}Both
 use the "battery" method.             </content>
