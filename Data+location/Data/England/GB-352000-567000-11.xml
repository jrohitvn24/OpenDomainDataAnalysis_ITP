		<title>11MILKING</title>
		<content> My name is Daphne Tweddle. I live at  
 the Centurion Inn, Walton. I have to  
 write about milking. On a farm a      
 farmer usually milks twice a day in   
 his milking parlour. In the parlour   
 there is sets of cups to put on the   
 cows udders and and the milk is       
 sucked up into some big jars. Then the
 milk tanker would come and collect the
 milk and take it away. A good cow     
 produces about 11\ gallons a day. Mr. 
 Gibson has a helper called Ian Allen. 
 He flushes the milk parlour out with  
 40 gallons of cold water then 40      
 gallons of hot water and chemical. And
 finally with 40 gallons of cold water.
 After that Mr Gibson puts his feet up 
 and has a rest at the end of the day. 
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
