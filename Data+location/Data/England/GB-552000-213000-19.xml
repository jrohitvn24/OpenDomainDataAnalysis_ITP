		<title>19Hatfield Hth. Police Station</title>
		<content> A group from our school visited the   
 police station and interviewed one of 
 the constables.  We were amazed to    
 find that their area was as big as 82 
 square miles and there were five      
 constables and one sergeant but only  
 one police car.  We were asked to name
 a month from this year and we found   
 that in that month there were 119     
 telephone messages to the police which
 included burglar alarms going off, an 
 electrical sub station blowing up and 
 domestic disputes.  Also in that month
 there were 8 crimes reported; 5       
 thefts, 2 burglaries and 1 for        
 handling stolen property.  The police 
 work various 8 hour shifts from 6 a.m.
 until 2 a.m.  The four hours in the   
 early hours of the morning are covered
 by a Harlow patrol.  A policeman's    
 equipment include a notebook, warrant 
 card, truncheon and steel hand-cuffs. </content>
