		<title>20Breamore-A Brief Botany</title>
		<content> densely covered,at different times of 
 year,by wild daffodils,bluebells and  
 foxgloves.                            
 But the floral glory of Breamore is   
 the small remnant of uncultivated     
{chalk downland.}In July it is a       
 colourful wild garden of knapweed,    
 ladies bedstraw,marjoram,migonette,   
 viper's bugloss,agrimony and many     
 more.                                 
 The delicate yellow blossoms of the   
 cowslip once nodded in the breeze on  
 many chalky pastures. In the Fifties, 
 it was still picked for flavour as    
 well as decorative value.             
 Vast numbers were needed to make      
 cowslip wine,which appeared at local  
 shows.                                
 Now the downs are huge arable         
 fields,and I found only three lonely  
 cowslip plants on a five-mile walk    
 through Breamore's downland.          </content>
