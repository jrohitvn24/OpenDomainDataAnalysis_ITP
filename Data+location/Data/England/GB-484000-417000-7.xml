		<title>07A Great Day</title>
		<content> In the year 1977 everyone was busy    
 preparing for Queen Elizabeth'S Silver
 Jubilee.The preparations were started 
 many weeks before the grand           
 celebration.Everywhere was decorated  
 with flags and other things.The grand 
 day finally came and my friends and I 
 were very excited.Later that afternoon
 all the floats were heading towards   
 the playing field.When we arrived at  
 the playing field the vicar held a    
 church service in order to celebrate  
 the Jubilee.The Celebration started   
 with a play acted out by my drama     
 group.Next came a tea for the Old Age 
 Pensioners.The day went on a treat and
 everybody was enjoying themselves.That
 evening a disco was held for the      
 adults.It was one of the happiest     
 village events I can remember.Now     
 every year in July we hold a village  
 fayre.                                </content>
