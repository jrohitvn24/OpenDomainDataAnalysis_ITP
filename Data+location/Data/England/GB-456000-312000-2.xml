		<title>02ROTHLEY FARMER CHANGES STOCK</title>
		<content>   Farmer Jack Wright of Brookfields   
 farm is a tenant farmer, which means  
 he doesn't actually own any land      
 himself.{He farms 500 acres: 250      
{cereals and 250 grass, has 254 cows, 1
{bull, 130 pigs, 32 ewes, and 58 lambs.
 He has a lot of equipment including 5 
 tractors and 1 combine harvester.     
                                       
   Although Mr.Wright did a lot of     
 dairy farming a few years ago, the EEC
 butter mountain has meant that{the    
{government has reduced how much milk  
{they will buy from him by 11%.}He had 
 to sell{25 cows},and to keep up his   
 money he had to look round for another
 form of farming. In the end, Mr.Wright
 chose to buy{130 pigs}.               
                                       
   This has meant a change in farming  
 methods, and villagers have noticed a 
 change in the smell from the farm!    </content>
