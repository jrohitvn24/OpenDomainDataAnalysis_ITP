		<content>{The Bedroom}is used mainly for        
 sleeping and dressing, although a     
 child's bedroom may also be used as a 
 playing room,or a place to do school  
 homework.Children may sometimes share 
 a bedroom. Furnishings would include a
 bed,usually with a sprung mattress.It 
 may be covered with a feather duvet,or
 sheets and blankets.There may be a    
 wardrobe and a chest of drawers for   
 storing clothes.Also a small bedside  
 table,with an electric lamp,and       
 perhaps an electric radio / alarm     
 clock.In some bedrooms,you might also 
 find a bookcase,and perhaps a toy box.
 The floor is normally carpeted,and    
 there will be curtains at the windows.
 The room may be heated by gas,electric
 or oil heaters,used only in the winter
 months.
