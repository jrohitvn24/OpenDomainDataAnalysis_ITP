		<title>13Holwell-Local History</title>
		<content> About half of the houses are very old;
 many more than 200 years old, and 1:3 
 of these claim to be over 300 years   
 old.                                  
 The area was part of Blackmore Forest,
 and the paths through the trees from  
 the clearings to the church can be    
 clearly traced today,as roads and foot
 -paths.                               
 Some old trees remain:notably Gog and 
 Magog,two hollow oaks hundreds of     
 years old,on the road from Sandhills  
 to Glanvilles Wootton,near Round      
 Chimneys Farm.                        
 One road through Holwell is thought   
 by some to be pre-Roman.It was        
 certainly used in medieval times by   
 travellers from Sherborne Abbey to    
 Blandford.Travellers from Sherborne   
 to Milton Abbey used it too.Parts of  
 hedges along its route can be seen to 
 be several hundred years old.         </content>
