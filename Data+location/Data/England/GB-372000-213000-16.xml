		<content> The meaning of names of immediately   
 adjoining areas which Daniel has      
 traced remain applicable today:Rodley,
 meadow in the reeds,still has reed-   
 fringed lanes winding between pasture 
 land and Hayden,hay on a hill ( old   
 word Haydown ), is a small area of    
 undulating land supporting hayfields. 
   Richard's home,a house on the bank  
 of the river,has a special upstairs   
 window looking over the water which   
 is known as the smugglers' window     
 because of stories of its use.        
   Several of the children at our      
 school are cousins:complicated net-   
 works of family relationship abound   
 among the long-established residents. 
 There are also recently-arrived people
 who on the whole have to travel out of
 the immediate area to work.Old or new,
 the commitment to the community shows 
 and is of great benefit to it.        </content>
