		<title>11Our Local Church</title>
		<content> Our local church is quite an          
 interesting one. Its tower is         
 separated from the church. The tower  
 was built before the church. When the 
 Civil War came, one side shot arrows  
 at the tower. On Tuesday, some of the 
 local people ring the bells in the    
 bell tower. Sometime in the spring our
 new vicar was inducted. He is much    
 more lively than the last vicar. Every
 fortnight we go to a family service in
 Westbury Church. There is a lay-      
 reader. I like the family service     
 because it is not dull it is lively   
 and it has lively songs too. Sometimes
 the lay-reader explains hard things in
 a more simple way to the children.    
 After the service we have coffee and  
 biscuits. When it was the family      
 service's first birthday we had a     
 birthday cake to celebrate.
