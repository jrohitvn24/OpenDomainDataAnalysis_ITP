		<title>17Hilliers Sausage Factory.</title>
		<content>   After this we went over to the      
 sausage factory where we washed our   
 hands again.We went into a room which 
 was a large refrigerator where they   
 kept the meat at minus{1}degree       
 centigrade.There were{20}kilos of pork
 on each tray.A bowl-chopper which     
 chopped the meat and mixed in the     
 other ingredients was next to the     
 refrigerator.The bowl-chopper costs{  
{Â£50,000.}Sausages are made of {65%    
 meat:beef or pork.From one batch of   
 meat,{1200}sausages are produced.Next 
 we saw the sausage-meat being put into
 the skins.There are{2}kinds of        
 machines for putting sausages into the
 skins.One uses a metal bar with skin  
 put on it,into which the meat is      
 squeezed.The other machine moulds skin
 into a sausage shape with meat in it. 
 Afterwards we were each given a pork  
 pie and some sausages to take home.   </content>
