		<title>14General farming in the area</title>
		<content>   In this area land use is split      
 primarily two ways. Two thirds are    
 used for wheat and one third is used  
 for dairy cattle.  Minor interests    
 appear to be winter grazing for sheep,
 apple production for the local Taunton
 Cider Company and eggs from battery   
 hens.                                 
   The largest farm complex in the area
 is owned by the Venn family.  His     
 recent purchase of Longaller farm     
 (200 acres) is used entirely for wheat
 and winter barley. It also supports a 
 small cider apple orchard  - the rest,
 including a row of cottages and an old
 mill is being neglected, and the farm 
 house is being rented out. Of the     
 remaining 500 acres, 300 acres are    
 used for wheat, the rest is pasture   
 for his 200 Friesian and 100 Jersey   
 cattle.   During the winter he takes  
 on 1000 sheep.                        </content>
