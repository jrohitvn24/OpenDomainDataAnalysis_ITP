		<title>13Summer in Kington Langley 2.</title>
		<content>  There is also the{Greathouse Fete}at 
 the Cheshire Home in the village. They
 had horse and cart rides,welly        
 throwing,craft shows,dart throwing to 
 win a fish, trampoline and lots of    
 inflatables. The best one was Moby    
 Dick, which was a blow up whale.      
  On one stall, to win a fish, you had 
 to pay 35p for three darts and had to 
 hit three separate playing cards. We  
 won three goldfish and named them     
 Goldy, Piranha, and Moby Dick.        
  There was also break dancing, a fire 
 engine and free fall parachuting. It  
 was very full and the car park was    
 packed.                               
                                       
  This year we are having a cold       
 summer. Last year it was very hot and 
 after we had lain in the sun for a day
 or two we looked like very burnt      
 Indians.                              </content>
