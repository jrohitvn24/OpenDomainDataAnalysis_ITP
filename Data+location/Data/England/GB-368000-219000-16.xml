		<title>16       Transport</title>
		<content> In 1965 the railway through{Longhope} 
 was closed and since then the only    
{public transport}has been a bus       
 service to{Gloucester,Ross and        
{Hereford}along the{A40}and a service  
 to{Gloucester,Cinderford and Monmouth}
 along the{A4136}.The{bus service}is   
 not very frequent and most people rely
 on their own cars for shopping trips  
 and daily journeys to work. The lack  
 of shops in the village mean that     
 trips to{Ross}or{Gloucester}are quite 
 frequent. Most people we interviewed  
 preferred{Gloucester}but this was not 
 surprising as it had the most frequent
{bus service}.The main roads carry     
 lorry traffic and tourists bound for{ 
{Wales}and we have noticed people use  
 the village road as a short cut       
 between the two main roads.
