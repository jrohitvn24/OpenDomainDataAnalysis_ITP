 Goodnestone Post Office is small.     
 They sell almost everything.  They    
 have a section for household          
 medicines, sweets, household needs, a 
 section for gifts.  Mrs Meadows is the
 shop_keeper and Mr Meadows is the     
 Post_Master. Mr Meadows delivers his  
 newspapers to Goodnestone and         
 Chillenden.  The most popular         
 newspaper is the 'Mirror'. The most   
 popular comic is 'Warplane'. Mrs      
 Meadows told us that on average 86    
 people come in a day. I asked Mrs     
 Meadows why children come to the Post 
 Office, she said to buy sweets and    
 drinks.  They get their stocks from   
 'Cash and Carry' in Canterbury. 'Cash 
 and Carry' is a warehouse for         
 shopkeepers.
