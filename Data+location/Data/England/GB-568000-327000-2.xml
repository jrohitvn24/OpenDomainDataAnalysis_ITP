		<title>02Sandringham Estate</title>
		<content> The Sandringham Estate forms the focal
 point for the many people who visit   
 this area of Norfolk each year. At the
 centre is The House standing in       
 typical, rolling, English parkland. In
 the surrounding woods, there are      
 nature trails along which a           
 proliferation of wildlife can be      
 observed.                             
                                       
 Although The Estate is a major tourist
 attraction it is essentially a working
 estate where animals are reared and   
 crops grown.                          
                                       
 The Estate is in the hands of The     
 Queen's Agent and there are more than 
 100 workers employed in a wide range  
 of jobs.
