		<title>11ST. MARY'S CHURCH</title>
		<content> The present building was rebuilt in   
 1878,&amp; contains some features of the  
 former church from the same site. The 
 porch was completed in 1906 and the   
 tower in 1911.The building is large &amp; 
 imposing &amp; thought by many visitors to
 be much older.In 1982 the chancel     
 floor was removed owing to creeping   
 decay &amp; was out of use for nearly a   
 year. During this time major repairs  
 were also found necessary to the      
 Chancel roof, so the Church Council   
 embarked on an energetic campaign of  
 fund raising. As a result of many     
 generous gifts, the repairs were      
 completed &amp; the Chancel reinstated.A  
 planned programme of improvements is  
 being carried out-phase 1,painting the
 entire Chancel;2,painting the North &amp; 
 South Aisles;3,providing new lighting;
 4,painting the Nave. Additionally,    
 general repairs &amp; maintenance continue</content>
