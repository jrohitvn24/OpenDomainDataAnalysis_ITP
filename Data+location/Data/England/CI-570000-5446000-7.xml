		<content>      At La Platte Rocque there is a   
 house which was to be turned into a   
 restaurant.  But a lady started a     
 petition against it.  She said it     
 would disturb the beach and the       
 fishing as well as spoil some historic
 buildings.  They would have knocked   
 down the round tower and German bunker
 which are there still.  The tower is  
 built out of granite and the bunker is
 made out of concrete.  The front of   
 the nearby house would have been made 
 more modern and the windows would have
 been made bigger.  In front of the    
 house are some plants, shrubs and     
 turf.  Those would have been dug up   
 and the front would have become       
 tarmac.  There is also a wall which   
 would have been knocked down for a    
 large entrance.  But luckily the      
 petition succeeded.
