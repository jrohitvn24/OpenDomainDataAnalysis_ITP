		<title>08KETTLEWELL - SHEEP FARMING</title>
		<content>   Sheep farming is the main farming   
 enterprise in the area.  The high land
 is rough pasture which is only        
 suitable for sheep grazing.  The sheep
 flocks are usually either Dalesbred or
 Swaledale, but these are crossed with 
 Mashams, Blue-faced Leicester and     
 Suffolk rams for a bigger more        
 marketable lamb.  The rams are put to 
 the ewes in November and the ewes     
 then spend most of their pregnancy on 
 the hills.  From early January they   
 need supplementary feeding, and before
 lambing they are brought into the     
 meadows and pastures of the valley    
 bottom.  Before the flock is turned   
 back to the higher pastures the lambs 
 are marked, castrated, tailed etc. The
 ewes are shorn in June and            
 compulsory dipping takes place in July
 and October. The lambs go to market in
 August and September.                 </content>
