		<content>Football is the favourite sport in the 
area, probably because there is a      
football ground in Shepherds Bush.It is
where Queens Park Rangers play.The     
pitch was grass but now it is made from
astro-turf.The club were the first in  
England to have an artificial          
pitch.When the football season is      
over,the ground can hold other sporting
events,such as boxing or hockey.The    
White City Stadium was also popular for
sporting events, mainly running,       
greyhound racing and speedway. This has
now been pulled down to build a        
supermarket. All school children play  
sport in school.This is usually        
footbal, hockey,tennis,cricket,rounders
and netball.They all use the local     
swimming pool at various times during  
school hours. The Stadium on Wormwood  
Scrubs is used for local sporting      
events.                                </content>
