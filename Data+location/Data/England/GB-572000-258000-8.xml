		<title>08The mobile library in Ousden</title>
		<content> Every 2 weeks the mobile library      
 passes through the village, stopping  
 at publicised places for 10 minutes   
 for people to return and collect their
 books. The van is well stocked with   
 books to suit all tastes, books for   
 children, fiction and non-fiction and 
 a selection of books with large print 
 for those with eyesight difficulties. 
 The mobile library is often a meeting 
 place for not only the exchange of    
 books, but an exchange of gossip, a   
 friendly chat and a chance for people 
 to meet their neighbours. The         
 selection of books is changed fairly  
 frequently. On the whole the most     
 popular section is the fiction, novels
 are recommended from one reader to    
 another. Books can be ordered from the
 main library at Mildenhall at a charge
 otherwise the service is free.
