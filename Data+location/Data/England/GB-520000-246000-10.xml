		<content>      The Local Nursery                
 At the local nursery,a wide range of  
 plants is grown_from small alpine     
 plants to trees and shrubs.           
 The main outlets for the sale of      
 plants are the local street markets.  
 Many of the plants are imported from  
 other countries_trees and shrubs from 
 Belgium and fuschias,bulbs and seeds  
 from Holland.                         
 26 peple work at the nursery.The      
 majority of the work is carried out by
 hand although a lot of the hard work  
 has been reduced by the introduction  
 of a potting machine.There is also,in 
 operation,a machine for packaging     
 bulbs.The young plants are brought on 
 in greenhouses then they are put      
 outside to harden off before being    
 sold.The major running expenses at the
 nursery in our climate is the cost of 
 greenhouse heating.                   </content>
