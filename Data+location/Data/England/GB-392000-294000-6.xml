		<content>I go to Spring Vale Primary school. The
school is twenty five years old. There 
are ten classes and a nursery.   This  
year there are 275 children at school  
in total. The school staff consists    
of the Head master, deputy head, the   
teachers, secretary,   cooks,          
cleaners, and caretaker. There   are   
fourteen teachers. In winter the       
caretaker has to stoke the boilers     
and clear the paths of snow. The       
Secretary has to count dinner money,   
type out letters and look after the    
lunch boxes. Each morning we begin     
with an assembly. Our lessons are      
English, Mathematics, Art,             
handwriting, spelling, stories,        
History,P.E. and Topic work.   This    
year we have done a topic on "Our      
School" as it is our Jubilee year. On  
the last day of term we have a sing-   
song in the Hall.                      </content>
