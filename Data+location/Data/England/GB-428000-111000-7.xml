		<content>{Budds Farm}has 200 acres of land. On  
 the farm are 102 Fresian Cows in the  
 milking herd. They are milked twice a 
 day, at 6am and 3.30pm, 7 days a week.
 Each milking takes the farmer about 1 
 hour and 15 minutes. The farm also has
 50 Beef cows and a bull, all white    
 faced Herefords. There are also 100   
 followers on the farm, that is cows at
 other stages but not in these 2 herds.
 In the winter the cows come into a    
 shed with 100 cubicles in it and stay 
 there from October to March. There are
 no dogs, pigs,or sheep on the farm,   
 but three pet cats and four pet ducks.
 There is a horse on the farm which is 
 used for pleasure ridings. Moles are a
 problem on the farm, digging up the   
 grass. There are a few hens on the    
 farm, but the farmer's wife buys her  
 eggs elsewhere. Varying types of bird,
 including Woodpeckers have been seen  </content>
