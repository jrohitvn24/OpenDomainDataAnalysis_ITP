		<content>   When it is playtime I play 40-40    
 which is like Hide and Seek. One of us
 has to count somewhere where you can't
 peep (this is called the post). You   
 have to count to 40. The other child- 
 ren run to a hiding place. When the   
 person has stopped counting he has to 
 look for the others. If you are hiding
 you have to get back to the post      
 without letting him see you. When you 
 get back to the post you have to say  
 40-40 in. If the person who is on it  
 sees you he tries to get back to the  
 post first and he says 40-40 David (or
 whatever their name is). People who   
 are caught have to stay by the post,  
 but if the last person gets back to   
 the post without being seen he can say
 40-40 save-all and all the children   
 who have been caught are saved and the
 same person has to be on it again.
