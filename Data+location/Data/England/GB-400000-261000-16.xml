		<title>16A VISIT TO A FARM</title>
		<content>   We went to visit the local farm. The
 farmhouse was very old,C16, it was a  
 listed building. First we saw the farm
 machinery in the big barn. There was a
 combine harvester, four tractors,a    
 spinner, a dumper, a bailer, a three  
 furrow plough and a fork lift truck.  
   The farm is 65 acres. It has 4 cows 
 and we saw a calf that was only a week
 old. We went in the milking parlour.  
 They milk 6.00am in the morning and   
 5.00pm.                               
  We went to see the fields of oats and
 barley and wheat. We also picked some 
 oil plants with nice yellow flowers,  
 these were for margerine.             
  The farmer said he could plough an   
 acre an hour.                         
   We saw lots of chickens, they made a
 lot of noise. The farmer gave us an   
 egg each to take home. I had mine for 
 tea with chips and beans.             </content>
