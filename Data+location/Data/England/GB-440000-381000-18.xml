		<title>18The "low fares" debate</title>
		<content>   South Yorkshire Transport and East  
 Midland Motor Services provide bus    
 services in this area. The fares in   
 South Yorkshire differ greatly from   
 those charged in Derbyshire. Halfway  
 to Sheffield (8 miles) costs 15p.     
 Halfway to Eckington (3 miles) costs  
 28p.                                  
  The reason for this is S.Y.T.'s low  
 fares policy. Throughout 1985 there   
 has been a strong public debate about 
 this policy which results from        
 subsidies from South Yorkshire County 
 Council. Central government           
 legislation is presently being        
 prepared to alter this and those who  
 support the county council have quoted
 possible fare increases of 500%.      
 Others who do not use buses regularly 
 object to their rates being used to   
 subsidise those who do.
