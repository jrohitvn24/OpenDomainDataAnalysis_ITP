		<title>13ASTON-BY-STONE VILLAGE</title>
		<content>  The piece of land on which Aston     
stands forms part of the flood plain on
the south-west bank of the River Trent.
It is therefore generally quite flat   
and level at about 90 m. above sea     
level. The River Trent meanders its way
through the pastures that border it,   
with the Trent &amp; Mersey Canal running  
alongside it to the north-west. The    
land rises slightly to the south of the
river and on the higher land is the    
village of Aston. It must have been a  
settled estate in Saxon Times, for it  
figures in the Norman Domesday Book,   
which spells it 'Estona'. This was when
the estate was given by William the    
Conqueror to Robert de Toeni who       
changed his name to Robert de Stafford.
  Aston Village is a dormitory village 
for people working on local farms and  
in the nearby towns of Stafford and the
Potteries with access via the A.51 &amp; 34</content>
