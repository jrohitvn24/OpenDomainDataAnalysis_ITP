		<content>                                       
Father Kellyy is the priest in charge  
ofSt Catherine's Roman Catholic Church 
in Farington. He is the fourth priest  
as the original parish was part of St  
Main Worden, Leyland. The first church 
Farington was in the garage of the     
house of the local Mill owner. The     
house was bought by the church,        
demolished and a new bungelow built on 
site. The garage was extended to make  
room for more people.                  
Sunday Services are at 8.30,           
10.00,3.00and 6.00.                    
A typical day starts with the first    
service, then correspondence, visits to
the sick, elderly and bereaved.  After 
lunch more visits or reading and in the
evening often interviews with people   
getting married or christening.        
There is a branch of the Vincent de    
Paul society at the church.            </content>
