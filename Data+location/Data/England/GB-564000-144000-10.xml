		<title>10Whetsted Farm, Paddock Wood</title>
		<content>The main crop on farms in the area used
to be hops,as can be seen by the       
numerous oasthouses still seen in the  
vicinity.Due to a lessening in demand  
and a disease which hit the crops in   
the 50's hops are not so widely grown. 
Whetsted covers 174 acres of which 50% 
is arable with the remaining 50% given 
over to sheep.At present there are 150 
ewes and 250 lambs on the farm.        
Redland Tiles Ltd. have bought 40 acres
of land from the farm for gravel       
excavation. When the excavation has    
been completed,the land will be        
reclaimed and revert to farmland.      
Apparently,since the excavation began, 
wildlife in the area has increased,and 
a rare variety of owl was sighted last 
year.                                  
The farm employs 2 full time workers   
and one summer worker.
