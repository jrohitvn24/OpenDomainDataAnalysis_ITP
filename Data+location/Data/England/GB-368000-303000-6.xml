		<title>06AQUEDUCT - A NEW ESTATE.</title>
		<content> We moved onto the estate when it was  
 first built in 1981.There were lots of
 difficulties.There was not a bus      
 service.There were no dentists,doctors
 or even a shop.The main shopping      
 centre is about 3 miles away.In 1984  
 the bus service opened in Aqueduct.   
 This goes through Majestic Way one    
 bus every hour.There is a small       
 general store on the estate now.A     
 community centre has been built next  
 to the school where various local     
 groups such as the play group and mums
 and toddlers meet.There is still over 
 a mile to go to get to the doctors or 
 the dentists but a mobile clinic      
 visits the community center each week.
 We have asked four children who have  
 moved to Aqueduct what they like best 
 about the estate. They said either the
 big park or the old pit mounds that   
 are behind the school.                </content>
