 Smeatharpe (formerly Smith's Harp) is 
 right on the Devon/Somerset border.   
 It is situated on a plateau stretching
 several square kilometres, which is on
 average 25O metres above sea level.   
 It is a rural area and the village is 
 surrounded by farmland.               
 Smeatharpe is a sprawling village     
 which has a secondary road from       
 Honiton to Taunton running through it.
 There is a Village Hall, public       
 telephone box, postbox, and           
 approximately 32 houses with a        
 population of about 9O people.        
 About half a kilometre away lies      
 Newhouse, which comprises the Baptist 
 Church, Church Hall, manse and two    
 other cottages.                       
 Adjacent to Smeatharpe is a disused   
 wartime aerodrome which was sited here
 because of the high altitude.         </content>
