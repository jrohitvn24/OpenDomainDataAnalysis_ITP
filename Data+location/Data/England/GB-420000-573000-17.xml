		<content> Ray Lowes, the training officer,      
 and Eddie Haynes, a retired Mining    
 Surveyor answered our questions. They 
 get 1600 tonnes of coal from the mine 
 each day; steamcoal for power         
 stations, household, coking coal and  
 anthracite. 480 men and 4 women work  
 there. Last year (1984) all of them   
 were on strike. They cut coal with 3  
 shearer units and one coal cutter.    
 About 110 men work on each shift. They
 wear boiler suits, helmets, gloves,   
 safety glasses,boots,masks,belts and  
 lamps. They also use picks,shovels and
 axes.3 buses take men from the pithead
 to the drift.You must be 16 to work in
 the mine. Some men retire at 50,others
 at 65. There are over 80 rooms,       
 including 16 offices and a canteen.   
 The first shaft opened in 1844 and the
 present drift will close for ever in  
 Autumn 1986.                          </content>
