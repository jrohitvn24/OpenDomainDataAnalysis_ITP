		<content> This block is an example of a rural   
 area in the midlands.Most of the land 
 is intensely farmed for arable        
 crops.The farms are a moderate        
 size,the one we visited being 200     
 acres.The farming is highly           
 mechanised.Within the square lie two  
 small villages.These have swollen     
 during the last 20 years but their    
 growth has been controlled by the     
 green belt area.We have tried to look 
 at the area in terms of:are the       
 villages self-sufficient or have they 
 become residential areas for the      
 wealthy labour forces of Rugby,       
 Coventry and Leamington?To this end we
 have looked closely at the village    
 shops,the village pubs, transport     
 housing and leisure activities of the 
 population.Unfortunately our          
 conclusions are that "the village" no 
 longer exists.                        </content>
