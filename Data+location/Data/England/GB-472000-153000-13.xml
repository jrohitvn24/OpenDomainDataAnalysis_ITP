		<title>13PHILLIP'S VIEW OF HOOK SHOPS</title>
		<content> Hook's shops are very poor for it's   
 size especially as the village is now 
 growing at an incredible rate.Most of 
 them are small-there is only a limited
 range of goods.Most people travel to  
 Basingstoke,Farnborough,Reading,Fleet 
 or even Hartley Wintney for groceries 
 which is costly in time and petrol.   
 This is even more of a problem if you 
 are old or have not got a car,like my 
 Granny.She buys groceries from the    
 milkman which is very expensive.      
 Stupidly a few years ago International
 closed (now a bathroom shop)-they'd do
 well now.We urgently need at least one
 really big superstore which sells     
 everything including bikes,clothes and
 toys which would be open every day.I'm
 sure it would be profitable as most   
 people are fed up with the 21 shops we
 have now, especially the ones that are
 antique shops or estate agents.       </content>
