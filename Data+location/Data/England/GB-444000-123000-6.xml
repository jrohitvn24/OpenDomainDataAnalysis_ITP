 because there was a cherry orchard on

 years old. Cherrycroft Cottage was    
 built as two Cottages for two farm

 building of the cottages with the     
 construction of a big chimney stack   
 with a bread oven on either side. The 
 wall of the Cottage are timber framed,
 filled with wattle and daub. The fram 
 work was laid out horizontally on the 
 church field next to the cottage. It  
 was then hoisted into an upright      
 position and moved to the site. The   
 size of the room was measured by a    
 goad.                                 </content>
