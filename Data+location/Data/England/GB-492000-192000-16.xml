		<content>  A good way to pass the time, if      
 there                                 
 are two or more of you is to play     
 board games.                          
  {Monopoly}is probably the all time   
 favourite. It is a game of strategy,  
 skill and luck. It consists of moving 
 various objects round a square board, 
 buying and selling property. To add to
 the luck department, there are        
 'Chance' and 'Community Chest' cards  
 around the board. The aim is to gain  
 the most money.                       
  Another popular game is{Trivial      
{Pursuit},where you have a small piece 
 that you have to move around by       
 answering questions of no importance  
 whatsoever! The first person to       
 collect four 'cheeseys', that you get 
 by boarding special squares, wins.    
  Other favourites include{Totopoly,   
{Cluedo, and Scrabble.}                </content>
