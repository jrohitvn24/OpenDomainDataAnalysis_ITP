		<content> This 12 Km block lies between the     
 villages of Belsay and Bolam. It is   
 undulating country with irregular     
 fields surrounded by thorn hedges with
 a good number of mature hedgerow      
 trees. The land is used for growing   
 cereals, roots, and grass mainly as   
 stockfeed as it is traditionally  beef
 and lamb producing area. There are 10 
 farmsteads, a total of 31 houses and a
 population of 80 persons. Most of the 
 residents are employed on the land or 
 in support of the landworkers.        
 The area is 'greenbelt'and no         
 developement other than a by_pass for 
 Belsay village is proposed. The       
 nearest cattle markets are at         
 Ponteland 6 miles  or Newcastle 14    
 miles away.                           
 Leisure activities are generally home 
 orientated as anything else involves a
 journey of 20 or 30 miles.            </content>
