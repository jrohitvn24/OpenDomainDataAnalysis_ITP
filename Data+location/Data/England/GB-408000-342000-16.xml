We went to find out about the social   
activities and amenities available in  
Ellastone. We asked what sort of       
organisations people can join. We found
they could join WI,Reading room,       
Entertainment committee, Parish Council
or Parochial Church Council.           
We then asked about evening classes or 
day classes held in the village hall   
and were told that occasionally        
patchwork, crochet and yoga classes    
had been held.                         
There is a Gala day and cheese and wine
garden party held annually. These      
events are to raise money and for      
people to enjoy. In July 1985 for the  
first time a horse show was held in    
Ellastone, proceeds to the church.
