		<content>     First year pupils interviewed     
 grandparents or elderly neighbours for
 changes in the area.Some of the       
 changes commented on change of use of 
 some of the large houses on the Drive 
 to hotels or apartments.The Palace    
 Cinema is now a shopping arcade an    
 even more recent change a three studio
 cinema to one cinema &amp; bingo hall.Many
 small family businesses have been     
 replaced by larger concerns.The job   
 centre was once a Penny Bazaar and    
 Boot's car park a bowling green.Farms 
 on Blackpool Old Road replaced by     
 flats and bungalows.Some playing      
 fields have been built on.Along the   
 front Granny's Bay once sand-dunes is 
 now grassed.Tankers would be seen     
 sailing to Preston Docks (now closed) 
 and dredgers confined the River Ribble
 in the attempt to master struggles for
 supremacy between drifting sands &amp; sea</content>
