		<content>{St. Marks Church}in Coulby Newham has 
 lived in community buildings for seven
 years. This has meant:                
 - learning how to share space and     
 availability of bookings with other   
 groups so having a natural, as opposed
 to priviliged, place in the community.
 -people, especially children,         
 recognising the church as a group of  
 people - not a building.              
 - the challenge of doing religious    
 things without many aids or{symbols.  
 - the opportunity to discover new     
 patterns of{worship}and{leadership    
 which naturally come from all being on
 the same level.                       
 - the flexibilty of moving our chairs 
 round for particular purposes or      
 moving to different buildings when the
 situation demands.                    
    In this way we experience the joys 
 and pains of being a pilgrim people.  </content>
