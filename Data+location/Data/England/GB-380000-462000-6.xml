		<title>06THE NAKED MAN IN SETTLE</title>
		<content>  We went up into Settle to the{cafe,  
{Ye olde Naked Man cafe}where we did a 
 survey on it. The cafe is quite big   
 and has a big sign on the outside of  
 it. Saturday is the most popular day  
 for customers and some of them are    
 quite famous television personalities.
 The cafe has been owned by the same   
 people for fifty two years. It is open
 all the year round except for two     
 weeks at Christmas time. In the summer
{tourists}are attracted to the cafe    
 (particularly because of the{naked man
 on the sign.) The cafe used to be an  
 inn that was built in 1663. One of the
 stories about the name is that a man  
 was buried naked underneath the       
 building.                             
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
