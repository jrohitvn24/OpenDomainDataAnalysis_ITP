 Any number of people can play this    
 game. One person is chosen to stand in
 front of the other people. The other  
 people say "Eggy-peggy what's on      
 telly" to the person in front of them.
 That person then chooses a subject and
 the other players have to csecretly   
 choose what they will be. When they   
 have chosen the player at the front   
 lists a number of items concerning the
 subject. If one of the players has    
 also chosen that item that player must
 'fight' the person at the front.      
  In the 'fight' both contestants must 
 stand on one leg and hold hands. Then 
 they push each other around. The first
 person to put both feet down on the   
 ground is the loser and takes the     
 place of the person at the front.     
 Changing legs is not allowed.
