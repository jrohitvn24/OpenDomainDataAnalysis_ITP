		<title>08MORE SHOPS IN N.FERRIBY.</title>
		<content>   On the Low Street there is a green  
 grocer's,a fish and chip shop and a   
 wool shop  and further along the      
 street is a butcher's, a baker's and a
 general store .                       
   Opposite the Church there is a post 
 office,a Mace Store,a chemist,a fruit 
 and vegetable shop and a newsagent's. 
   We interviewed certain key shop     
 owners and found the main influence   
 upon their shops has been the opening 
 of a Sainsbury's Store in Hessle 7    
 miles away.Many families do the week's
 shopping at Sainsbury's and use the   
 village shops for fresh foods and any 
 food they have forgotten and need in a
 hurry.Prices in the village tend to be
 higher reflecting the slower turnover.
