 There has probably been a church at   
 Patrington since Anglo-Saxon times.It 
 is one of the finest parish churches  
 in the country with the beauty of a   
 small cathedral.The building is built 
 in the shape of a cross,141 feet in   
 length and 86 feet across the arms.The
 central tower has a spire climbing to 
 a weathercock 189 feet above the      
 churchyard.Except for fragments of an 
 earlier building,it is almost entirely
 14th century,built during the 40 years
 before the Black Death halved the     
 population of England so that the work
 was not finished until 1410.An appeal 
 has  been launched this year to raise 
 Â£250,000 for urgent repairs to the    
 spire and roof.
