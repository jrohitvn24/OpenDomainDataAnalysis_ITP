		<title>08A Day At Beswick School</title>
		<content> At 8.30am I set off to cycle to school
 with my friend, arriving around       
 8.40am. Before school starts, we play 
 games in the yard. School starts at   
 9.00am with Assembly. Morning lessons 
 usually consist of Mathematics,       
 Spelling and Language work, with Music
 and P.E. on Wednesday. At 10.30am we  
 have a 15 minute break and at 12 n00n 
 we stop for lunch which is served in  
 the main classroom. The meals are     
 cooked at Leconfield School, about 3  
 miles away. Afternoon school starts at
 1.15pm, and usually consists of       
 Project work (i.e. integrated or      
 environmental studies), Science and   
 Art and Craft. We also have Games and 
 Drama sessions. Afternoon break is at 
 2.30pm. School clubs, such as chess,  
 stamps and craft, are held after      
 lunch. Our micro-computer is used     
 every day. School finishes at 3.45pm. </content>
