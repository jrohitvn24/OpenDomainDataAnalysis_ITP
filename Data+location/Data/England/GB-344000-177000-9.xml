		<title>09THE POCHARD DUCK</title>
		<content>  On the small lake there was a{pochard
{duck.}It kept diving down for quite a 
 long time at a time.He had a red      
 head,white body,black breast and his  
 tail was also black.He had grey legs  
 and his wings were dark without any   
 noticeable speculum.                  
  Each time it dived down I timed on my
 stopwatch how long it stayed submerged
 for.The average time for it staying   
 submerged was{18.7seconds.}I timed it 
 ten times,wrote down all the          
 times,added them and divided the total
 by ten.This gave us the               
 answer,18.7seconds,the average time   
 for each dive.The longest dive was    
{23.4seconds}and the shortest was      
{13.9seconds.}It was followed on the   
 surface by a swimming blackheaded     
 gull.
