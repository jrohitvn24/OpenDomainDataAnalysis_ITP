		<title>05Smarden West - Family Monday</title>
		<content> Monday morning is chaotic, locating   
 dinner money and missing rugby socks  
 after the weekend, but somehow the    
 children get to school on time. Then  
 it's home to collect wellies &amp; the    
 dog, both men are away today &amp; I have 
 to feed the ewe lambs &amp; check the rest
 of the flock, no problems there so I  
 let our ancient pony out &amp; see to the 
 hens. It's now coffee time &amp; as usual 
 I'm starving so elevenses becomes an  
 early lunch, then with the house      
 quickly tidied, the washing machine   
 loaded &amp; a casserole in the oven it's 
 time to get the car out again &amp; go    
 shopping. Maidstone is crowded with   
 Xmas shoppers &amp; after struggling with 
 an overloaded trolley meet a friend   
 for coffee before going home,         
 collecting the children en route. The 
 men arrive home for dinner which we   
 all eat together at about 6.00pm.     </content>
