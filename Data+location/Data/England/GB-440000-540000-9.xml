		<content> In 1887{Thorpe Hospital}was used for  
 infectious diseases, in 1949 it became
 a maternity hospital, and in 1985 it  
 may become a hospital for the elderly.
 On June 24th 1985 a public meeting    
 organised by{Hartlepool, Durham and   
{Sunderland Community Health Councils, 
 was attended by 230 people who        
 discussed a{proposed change for Thorpe
{Hospital,}with its maternity services 
 being split between Sunderland and    
 Hartlepool.                           
                                       
 The case put was that Thorpe no longer
 meets national standards, it would not
 be a cut in services because better   
 care could be provided in central     
 units, and there was a need for beds  
 for elderly.{Local people disagreed.  
 They have "... had enough of half     
 baked ideas rushed through by people  
 who do not know the area."            </content>
