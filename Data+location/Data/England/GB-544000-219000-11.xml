		<title>11 A THORLEY FAMILY</title>
		<content>                                       
This family moved into Thorley         
recently.The father works in           
London.Their Manchester home had been  
sold so they needed accommodation      
quickly.They considered a Barbican     
flat close to his Fleet Street job but 
prefer a quieter enviromment away from 
the city.They picked up a leaflet      
 bout Thorley houses at a Barbican     
 exhibition,visited the area &amp; found a 
new house in Abbots Way ready for      
immediate occupation.It is a typical   
Thorley house,brick built with a tiled 
roof,detached,with 4                   
bedrooms,bathroom, downstairs          
toilet,kitchen,through living/dining   
room &amp; medium sized back  garden.The   
drive-way is shared with the next      
house.There is only one garage so  1   
of their 2 cars is parked outside at   
the front.                             </content>
