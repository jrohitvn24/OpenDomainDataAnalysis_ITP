		<title>15HUTTON ESTATE - LANDSCAPE</title>
		<content>   Hutton-in-the-Forest is set in      
 extensively landscaped grounds and    
 woods.  The Parkland is grazed, and   
 contains clumps of trees.  It is      
 intended to plant a series of new     
 clumps to replace those that are      
 getting old.                          
   To the Southwest of the house is a  
 rhododendron garden which has become  
 derelict.  With the help of the       
 Countryside Commission, a programme of
 restoration has been instituted.      
 Beyond this garden is an Eighteenth   
 Century lake which has been obscured  
 by scrub trees, and this is being     
 opened up.                            
   Planting around much of the house is
 partly 18th Century hardwoods, and    
 partly 19th Century conifers. It is   
 planned to continue the practice of   
 replanting with interesting trees when
 they come to the end of their life.   </content>
