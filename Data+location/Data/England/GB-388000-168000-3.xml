 are taught in three classes,a         
 part-time teacher helps for 2 days a  
 week and there is also a welfare      
 assistant to help in the infants. .   
 School begins at 9.00am and each day  
 is begun with a school{assembly.      
 Lessons cover a wide range of subjects
 such as creative writing, art and     
 craft, music, games and of course

 the summer months.  Mid-morning break
