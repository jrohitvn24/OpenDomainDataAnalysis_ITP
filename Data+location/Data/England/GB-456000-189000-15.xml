		<content>{The recreation ground} was given to   
the village by Mr Fairthorne in 1897   
for use as  a cricket pitch. In the    
1950's a sports club was formed and    
football was played as well. The       
recreation ground is now owned by the  
Parish Council and also has some       
swings and a see saw. Nearby are the   
alotments.                             
{King's Meadow} This is another        
recreation ground and was part of a    
development of new houses near the     
Village School. There are tennis       
courts, a playfort, a BMX cycle track  
and grass play areas.                  
{Brownies} The leader of the pack is   
Miss Gaines and we meet in the Village 
Hall every Wednesday from 6.00 to      
7.30pm. We pay 30p each week. Our      
sixes are called Elves, Lepracorns,    
Gnomes and Pixies. We join Brownies at 
7 years and leave at 11.               </content>
