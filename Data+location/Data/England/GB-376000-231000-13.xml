		<title>13Lack Of Sporting Facilities</title>
		<content> There are no sporting facilities  in  
 Pendock only at the School. You cannot
 play games on Saturdays.  I think     
 there should be a football club and   
 other clubs.  We have to go a long way
 to play games.  We have to go  to     
 Redmarley to play tennis and we have  
 to go to Gloucester for other sports. 
 In Gloucester there are lots of       
 sports.There is cricket, snooker, pool
 and squash and many other facilities. 
 There are not enough people in Pendock
 who like games and there is not enough
 money available in the area to pay for
 a sports' stadium, for those of us    
 who would like one.                   
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
