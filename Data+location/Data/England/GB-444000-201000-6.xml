		<title>06Housing in Wootton</title>
		<content>     Wootton  Parish  has  a population
 of 3000,  largely housed on estates to
 the  west  of  the main road.  The old
 village  stretching  up to Boar's Hill
 is  a  line  of {ribbon development}of
 very  low  density, the size of houses
 and  grounds becoming most spacious on
 Boar's  Hill.   The  village  green is
 backed  by  a  small  line  of  modern
 houses, one of which has been extended
 to provide a granny flat.             
     Across the green an old house,'The
 Butts', has been extended for the same
 purpose.   Close  beside the green are
 two very old thatched cottages, with a
 third  a  few doors away.  Some of the
 estates were originally council houses
 but  two thirds of these have now been
 bought  from the council by the former
 tenants.   Some  council  houses   are
 retained  for the use of RAF personnel
 based at Abingdon RAF station.        </content>
