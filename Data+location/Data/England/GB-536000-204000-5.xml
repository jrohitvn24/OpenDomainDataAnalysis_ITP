		<content> This part of Nazeing we covered was   
 nearly all residential with a vast    
 shortage of amenities. The only major 
 thing other than houses and a few     
 fields was a nursery. The houses,     
 although monotonous, were nice and    
 neat and clean-looking and had big    
 gardens.                              
 There did not seem to be any shops    
 apart from a tiny sweet shop/post     
 office, so the residents must have to 
 go a long way for their food. They    
 were not too crowded together, and    
 they had quite a bit of open space    
 between them, and the occasional swing
 park as well.                         
 The people round about were in the    
 main friendly, and helped me when I   
 got lost. There seemed to be quite a  
 nice little community going. I        
 wouldn't mind living there (although I
 would prefer Harlow)                  </content>
