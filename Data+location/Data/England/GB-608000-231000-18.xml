		<title>18The Tendring Hundred Show</title>
		<content> A large open-air exhibition comprising
 the latest agricultural machinary,    
 trade stands and items reflecting life
 and pursuits in this area is held in  
 Lawford in July. Tendring is the name 
 given to the district extending from  
 Gt. Bromley (and surrounding villages)
 to Clacton and Harwich. Lawford is a  
 fairly central site for the show which
 attracts many visitors and has a      
 social attraction for people from all 
 walks of life, not just the farming   
 community. (The term "Hundred" is     
 medieval in origin and denotes an     
 administrative district).This         
 show is typical of the annual         
 agricultural shows which provide the  
 social highlight of the county        
 calender in East Anglia. The Royal    
 Norfolk Show, the Suffolk Show and the
 Essex Show are more major examples.
