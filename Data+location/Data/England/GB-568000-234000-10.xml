 Public transport consists of two buses
 each week on market days,one to       
 Braintree on Wednesdays the other to  
 Haverhill on Fridays.                 
 Because of this scarcity most         
 households have one car and many have 
 two, particularly those where the     
 husbands work far away from the       
 village. Several youths have motor    
 bikes and most of the children have   
 bicycles which are well used,         
 especially at weekends and during     
 school holidays.                      
 There is a school bus during term time
 which picks the children up at various
 points in the village and outlying    
 district. Horses are used by a handful
 of people but are more for leisure    
 than transport.
