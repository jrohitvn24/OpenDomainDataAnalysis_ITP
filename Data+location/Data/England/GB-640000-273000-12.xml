		<title>12Families - Jonathan</title>
		<content>My name is Jonathan Sinden, but I am   
usually called Jo. I am 8 and I have   
two older sisters. My Dad is a         
Chartered Accountant, but I'm not sure 
what that means. Mum and Dad own a shop
in Harleston. We have lots of relations
near Wenhaston, most of them are nice. 
I have a pet collie dog called Bronty  
and a cat called Kippy. We have three  
cars. We have a Riley which is 43 years
old, a Ford Sierra and a Metro. I like 
the old Riley best. We live next to    
Mark Hardacre.                         
When we had a holiday in France, I ate 
lots of croissants, we can buy them in 
Harleston.                             
There is a dew pond on Blackheath, but 
it is drying up. We have been working  
on it for a topic at school. I love    
reading, especially encyclopedias and  
books about space.
