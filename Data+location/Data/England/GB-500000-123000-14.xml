		<title>14RECREATION - PETWORTH RURAL</title>
		<content> For young people who have left school 
 there are Leisure Centres at          
 Fittleworth, Petworth and Midhurst,   
 with a number of sports available,    
 including swimming, badminton and     
 tennis. One private house in the      
 district has a hard surface tennis    
 court installed for their own use. It 
 was completed by three men in as many 
 weeks. The village green at Wisborough
 Green is devoted to cricket. There is 
 a little fishing in the rivers Kird   
 and Arun, and one farm has its own    
 lake containing carp. The             
 Billingshurst Angling Society are very
 active at week ends on this lake. At  
 Hawkhurst Court a Residents           
 Association is being formed which,    
 beside safeguarding the shared        
 interests of its community, will      
 provide recreational opportunities for
 members.                              </content>
