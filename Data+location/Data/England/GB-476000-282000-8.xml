		<content>A couple of months ago our school had a
May Day celebration.Two May Queens were
chosen. It was Julie and I.We were     
crowned by Miss Neale.First we did some
Maypole dancing then we were crowned   
and then we were pushed in a decorated 
trolley to the village pub,The Swan,to 
do some Morris dancing.It was brilliant
being pushed in the trolley.After we   
had finished Morris dancing we came    
back to school for a tea party.The May 
Queens sat at the top of the table.We  
had a lovely tea.The May Queens danced 
one dance and that was called the      
Ribbon Dance.Parents came to watch us  
all dancing at the school and at The   
Swan in Braybrooke.Usually the two May 
Queens are the oldest girls from       
Braybrooke and Arthingworth at our     
school.
