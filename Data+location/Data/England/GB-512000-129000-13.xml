		<title>13PARTHINGS FARM,HORSHAM</title>
		<content>   Parthings farm is one of the oldest 
 buildings around{Tower Hill.}It was   
 built in the{fourteenth century}but   
 its{granary}was built even earlier.   
 Originally there was just a hole in   
 the roof to let out smoke from a fire.
 The chimney was added later when      
 they first came into use. The granary 
 is used now as a store room.          
   The farmhouse is made from wood, and
{Horsham stone}from nearby quarries.   
 The stone quarries have since been    
 filled in though some are still       
 visible. Inside the house there are   
 exposed wooden beams,Tudor style.     
   Very recently the{Horsham housing   
{development}has been spreading closer 
 and closer to Parthings as the owner  
 sells off parcels of land for         
 development. Will Parthings be in the 
 country much longer?
