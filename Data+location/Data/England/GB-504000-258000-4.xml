		<title>04The Windmills</title>
		<content> Thurleigh was a fine tower mill of the
 Lincolnshire type. The height to the  
 top was 60ft.. There were five floors 
 in total. On the second floor there   
 are two pairs of stones and the       
 remains of a wire machine. The        
 brakewheel which was made of wood and 
 is nine foot across is still visible. 
 One sail was blown off in 1917 and the
 other three plus the ironwork and the 
 gearing were removed in 1940 to help  
 the war effort. Planning permission   
 has now been granted for the mill to  
 be used as the central tower of a     
 house.                                
 The other windmill used to be adjacent
 to 16, Keysoe Road, but there are no  
 remains of it at all now.
