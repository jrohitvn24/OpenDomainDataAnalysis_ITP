		<title>04OUR CHURCHES</title>
		<content> Tortington church is a very small     
 church with quite a lot of old        
 graves.In the churchyard there is a   
 large old ram, the ram is there to    
 keep the grass nice and neat so that  
 the people of the church do not have  
 to do the work themselves. When we    
 went to visit Tortington church the   
 church was all locked up we           
 realised that it hadnt been kept as   
 nice as Clymping church. We could     
 tell because the walls were crumbling.
 The walls were made of flint and were 
 badly weathered. When l touched the   
 weathering it crumbled like talcum    
 powder or chalk. The church at Ford   
 was locked as well. It's a pity       
 that our churches have to be locked up
 because of vandals.
