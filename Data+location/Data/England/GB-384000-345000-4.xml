		<title>04A Typical Day in my Life</title>
		<content>I get up at 7,then go to the bathroom  
and get dressed.For my breakfast I have
cereal.When I have my school things    
ready I read.At 8.45 I call for my     
friend Narinder and walk to school,we  
talk together before school starts.    
We have Assembly then English.At       
10.40  we have playtime when I help    
with running the tuck-shop-sweets      
chocolate  and crisps.Maths is next.At 
12.00 we    have lunch ;I take         
sandwiches.At 1.00   we have           
History.We are studying the Second     
World War which interests me.    After 
playtime we have Geography,which  I    
also enjoy .At 3.30 I walk home.For    
tea I enjoy chips,mushrooms,bacon,and  
baked beans.Sometimes I watch          
television,but my main hobby is bird   
watching and I help to run the local   
YOC with my dad.I feed my fish before  
falling asleep.                        </content>
