    The name of fords has been linked  
 with Dagenham since the company       
 recognized the potential of the large 
 marshy site on the River Thames 60    
 years ago.                            
  The management have streamlined      
 production to increase efficiency. Now
 only the Fiesta and Sierra cars are   
 made at the factory which claims to   
 have the most modern production line  
 in Europe. there are 120 robots and   
 new automatic control systemsplus a   
 vast conveyer and transfer network.   
  Originally,the workforce came from   
 the Becontree estate, but now many    
 travel by road and rail. A ferry links
 Dagenham with the Dagenham jetty.     
  Unfortunately, automation has        
 resulted in a reduction in the  number
 of employees.                         
                                       </content>
