		<title>10 THEATRES</title>
		<content>In Northampton there are two main      
theatres:the Royal Theatre which is    
over one hundred years old and very    
famous, and the recently built         
multi-purpose Derngate Centre adjacent 
to it.                                 
The Royal Theatre is the only one of   
its kind in Britain. Most other        
theatres are named "Theatre Royal". It 
was originally an opera house when it  
was first opened in May of 1884. The   
price for seats is at a standard rate  
of four pounds, seventy-five pence. Its
most popular production has been "Blood
Brothers".                             
The Derngate was built upon the site of
the town's old United Counties 'Bus    
Station at a cost of over nine million 
pounds.
