		<content> The area is almost completly filled   
 with 20th century city council rented 
 houses.                               
 The only exception is on Padholm Road.
 Here there were 154 late 19th/20th    
 cen.small villa type houses           
 During the 1920's the Eastfield estate
 was built to rehouse people from the  
 demolished housing nearer the         
 Cathedral.All the 600 counted houses  
 were semi-detached or linked          
 housing.The Park Lane area were older 
 and often poorly kept. Here many      
 houses had been improved in 1984, with
 new roof,double glazing and           
 insulation.Along Reeves Wau the houses
 were about 10 years younger and better
 kept.At least 25 had been privately   
 bought over the last 2 years.There was
 some1960/70 infilling with modern     
 council flats.
