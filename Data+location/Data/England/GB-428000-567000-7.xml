		<content>The grounds of Wallsend Hall are now a 
public park.The area to the north of   
the row of poplar trees was originally 
the market garden of the Hall.When it  
became a park this was used by the     
Council as a area to rear bedding      
plants.Many of the garden workers      
reported hearing strange noises over   
the years which nobody could account   
for.Descriptions of this noise tell of 
a woman's footstep with a trailing     
dress going over a gravel path.When    
they looked up nothing could be seen.  
The path through this garden led from  
the village pump to a row of miners'   
cottages.The outhouses of the market   
garden have recently been demolished   
and the area grassed over.No reports   
of the mysterious footsteps have been  
made in the past five years.
