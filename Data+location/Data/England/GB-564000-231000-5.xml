		<title>05A TRADITIONAL FARMING FAMILY</title>
		<content> Daisy and Fred are a traditional      
 farming family.His parents were tenant
 farmers at Clock House farm,Little    
 Sampford.Fred was born there in 1905. 
 Although he had always wanted to be an
 engineer he left school at fourteen to
 follow his father into farming.Daisy  
 born in London was a pupil teacher at 
 Great Sampford School before she was  
 married.Both staunch members of the   
 Church.Daisy organist at Little       
 Sampford Church and Fred a Curchwarden
 for twenty one years.On his fathers   
 death the couple moved to Clock House,
 where subsequently Fred aquired the   
 freehold.Their two daughters were born
 at the farm and their granddaughter   
 Anna has put this survey onto the     
 computer.Thus in two generations, the 
 technology in one family has developed
 from the plough to the electronic     
 computer.                             </content>
