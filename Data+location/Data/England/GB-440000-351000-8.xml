		<content>  Ironville in 1919 was a self         
 contained model village built for     
 local workers inthe middle of the     
 last century.It had its own           
 elementary school,with 3 head         
 teachers,a church,gas and water works,
 and Mechanics Institute.In 1953       
 Coronation year they had a big bonfire
 to celebrate the queens crowning.The  
 village had grown in size because     
 houses had been built around the old  
 village.                              
 Now the old centre of the village has 
 been re developed with a new shopping 
 centre and the older houses           
 modernised.The village is still mostly
 self contained although people now    
 travel to work and shop.              
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
