		<content>Hornby Village Trust runs the village  
institute.It was originally used as a  
reading room in the village. When the  
Village Trust wanted to expand and     
develop the room they approached the   
then owner of Hornby Castle if he would
undertake to provide the village with  
enlarged facilities but he refused. The
village raised the money and had the   
Institute built almost 50 years ago.   
The Institute has become the social    
centre of not only the village but the 
whole area. Many of the village        
societies and organisations meet there 
to hold social, educational and money  
raising events. Rooms in the Institute 
can be hired for private parties; about
80% of the money raised by the Village 
Trust is through lettings. Without the 
Institute, much of the social life of  
the village would disappear and the    
strong community ties would be reduced.</content>
