		<title>06Todmorden Carnival</title>
		<content>   Todmorden Carnival is held on the   
 third Saturday of May every year.     
 Children and adults ride on decorated 
 wagons, called floats, and parade the 
 streets in fancy dress.Some people    
 wear uniforms and play instruments and
 twirl things called batons.Other      
 people line the streets to watch the  
 procession.Then they all go to Centre 
 Vale Park where there are charity     
 stalls, a funfair and a five-a-side   
 football competition for primary      
 schoolboys.On the fair there were     
 dodgem cars, a waltzer and games where
 you could win a goldfish.If you were  
 brave, you could go on the cable      
 slide, where you climbed a structure  
 and then slide down a rope.           
   This year it was pouring with rain, 
 but people still came in their        
 thousands.
