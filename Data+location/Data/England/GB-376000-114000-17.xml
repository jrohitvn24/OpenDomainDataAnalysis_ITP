		<content> Fiddleford. Most of the buildings are 
 purpose built and very modern. There  
 is also a Manor_House.                
{THE SHOOT}The shoot is organised once 
 a year by the shoot managers and the  
 part time keepers. This does not play 
 much of a part on the farm as it is   
 just for Mr. Pitt_Rivers and his      
 friends'relaxation. Most of the birds 
 are from the farm's own stock of      
 chicks.The birds that are purposely   
 bred for the shoot are pheasants,     
 partridges &amp; duck.                    
{SMALLER FARMS }Besides Hinton St. Mary
 farm, there are several smaller farms 
 to the west of the block. These are   
 mainly dairy farms but a few own pigs 
 and poultry. Few are larger than 100  
 acres.
