		<title>09HOUSING IN LINTON</title>
		<content>   There are a few modern flats and    
 bungalows but many of Linton's        
 cottages and houses are over 100      
 years old.                            
   New flats are being built in the old
 mill and some of the cottages in      
 Linton must be preserved in their     
 original state.There is a lot of      
 renovation work being carried out on  
 old cottages which consists of new    
 floors and sometimes a new            
 damp-course,new bathrooms and         
 kitchens.                             
   The problem with Linton is          
 the same as elsewhere,in getting      
 building plots,the cost is the next   
 item,as a single plot will reach      
 anything up to Â£45 000 per plot.      
   The majority of people have double  
 glazing,central heating and 3         
 bedrooms.The majority of houses are   
 owned,not rented.                     </content>
