		<content>{MOBBERLEY                             
 Mobberley is one of the largest       
 parishes in England, covering twelve  
 and a half square miles. It           
 encompasses many widely dispersed     
 hamlets which are set in gently       
 undulating countryside and it remains 
 mainly unaffected by the urban and    
 industrial developements of nearby    
 Manchester.                           
 The block which is covered by this    
 investigation is to the north of      
 Mobberley Village and therefore covers
 some of the hamlets and not Mobberley 
 itself.
