		<title>09 Rural Policeman &amp; Farmers</title>
		<content> The upholding of law and order is the 
responsibility of the rural policeman. 
                                       
He looks after a number of villages    
and farms;his work differs from that   
of the town policeman in many ways. He 
is responsible for seeing that all the 
rules are obeyed, if there is an out-  
break of a serious disease on the      
farms such as fowl pest,anthrax, foot  
&amp; mouth or swine fever. He has to see  
that notices are displayed restricting 
entry to the farmland and restricting  
the movement of animals within certain 
areas &amp; also that the afflicted        
animals are destroyed.  Sheep have to  
be dipped twice a year to kill         
parasites and the policeman has to     
check that this is done properly.
