		<title>11Near Grantham:Coldharbour</title>
		<content> Coldharbour lies to the south east of 
 Grantham at the modern junction of    
 Ermine St. and the A52 road to        
 Boston.The place name means an        
 inhospitable place generally on an    
 ancient road.Grantham's Coldharbour is
 on the old track of the Roman road to 
 Lincoln,now called the High Dyke.There
 is a large house called Blue Harbour  
 which used to be a public house.There 
 is also a farm house which is not     
 lived in and four other houses.The    
 farm out buildings are used for the   
 storage of hay                        
 Opposite,across the High Dyke there is
 a Government Vehicle Inspection       
 Station where heavy lorries undergo   
 the annual Ministry of Transport test 
 of roadworthiness.This is on the edge 
 of the old Spitalgate Airfield and    
 nearby there are some relics of       
 wartime storage bunkers.              </content>
