		<title>11LA MIELLE DE MORVILLE</title>
		<content> This is a major area of recreation    
 and it is situated opposite the Kempt 
 Tower in the south of the block.      
                                       
 Old refuse tips have been recontoured 
 and planted with grass to make them   
 look like dunes. The wildlife has been
 encouraged back to this area.         
                                       
 The needs of the car driver  have not 
 been forgotten and it is possible to  
 drive into the area and sunbathe or   
 have a picnic near where the car has  
 been parked out of sight of most other
 people using the area.                
                                       
 Local people and tourists alike can   
 now enjoy what used to be a derelict  
 area without feeling over crowded and 
 without doing any damage to the       
 interesting and essential wildlife    
 which has started to return here.     </content>
