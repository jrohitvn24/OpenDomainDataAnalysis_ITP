		<title>05A DAY AT BLACKO SCHOOL   (2)</title>
		<content> Then the junior children got          
 their maths books ready for S.M.P., a 
 system of cards which allows children 
 to progress at their own level. After 
 this, time to make a diary report.Many
 children wrote about the F.A.Cup Final
 -  Manchester United beat Everton!    
 Playtime 10.30 - 11.00. Diaries to    
 finish and a group using the computer 
 - computers should be in every        
 Primary School in the country by the  
 end of 1985! Dinner time now, hands to
 wash and time to change desks into    
 dining tables. Some children eat      
 sandwiches but most eat a school      
 dinner of fish and chips, a biscuit to
 follow.A sunny day, so playtime on the
 Recreation Ground follows. Afternoon  
 session begins at 1.15 - a story to   
 write, pottery,needlework and baking, 
 thanks to parents helping. This is    
 what makes a typical day.             </content>
