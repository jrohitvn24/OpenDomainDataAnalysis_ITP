		<content>                                       
     We asked when the first school was
 built.The old grammar school was the  
 John Hanson Grammar School.Mr Porter  
 went to East Street school and he had 
 a school cap which was yellow and     
 black stripes.He went to school at    
 9.00am till 4.00 pm, he liked school. 
     When he was mayor he raised an    
 appeal for India so they could make   
 pumps which pump out water.           
     We asked him about disasters in   
 Andover.The worst was when the whole  
 of New St. burnt down because the     
 buildings had thatched roofs and it   
 all went up in flames.                
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
