		<content>  Whitfield Mineral Works near Kingsley
is situated off the A52, down a little 
track. It used to be a brickworks with 
a chimney 50 feet high. Now they make  
fireclay aggregate which is exported   
to Norway, Portugal, Saudi Arabia and  
Australia.                             
 This is the process they use: the     
clay is brought in by wagons from      
Leicester, Shropshire and Scotland and 
stored in a large pile. A digger tips  
clay into a hopper. It passes under a  
massive iron drum which crushes it as  
fine as flour. Coke and water are      
added and it is baked at 1700F. It     
becomes fused into blocks. These are   
sprayed with water to cool them. They  
are ground again and put into bags.    
Certain grades may also be used as a   
binding agent in animal feed pellets.  
  Twelve men and one woman work there  
now.                                   </content>
