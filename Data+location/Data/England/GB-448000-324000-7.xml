		<title>07Occupations in Kegworth.</title>
		<content> Unfortunately in{Kegworth}there are   
 not many{jobs}so most people leave the
 village to work. They travel, usually 
 by car to the nearby towns of{Derby,  
{Leicester, Nottingham}or{Loughborough.
 The village has 26 small firms that   
{employ}mostly{Kegworth}people. These  
 small firms include 9 shops, banks, a 
 bakery, hairdressers, a few garages   
 and a building society. In late 1984  
 the{Carters Soft Drinks Company}built 
 a large warehouse on the outskirts of 
 the village which is a shame really   
 because it over shadows the village,  
 and ruins the countryside around.     
 There are four large works in         
 the village these are{Slack and Parr, 
{National Westminster Bank Computer    
{Centre, Refractory Mouldings}and the  
{Carters Soft Drinks company. }
