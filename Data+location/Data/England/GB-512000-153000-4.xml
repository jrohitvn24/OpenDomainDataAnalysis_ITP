		<title>04Rail Commuting from Bookham</title>
		<content> Few Bookham households are without    
 their{commuters,}most travelling from 
 Bookham station. Business and         
 professional men for{London}mix with  
 school children for{Epsom, Dorking}and
 Guildford. Despite equality of        
 opportunity, there are fewer female   
 travellers and most of them are young.
 Although the number of passengers has 
 greatly increased in the last 20 yrs  
 the range &amp; frequency of rail services
 has been steadily reduced, fares have 
 risen sharply (an annual season ticket
 to London costs Â£750), trains are     
 frequently cancelled and strikes      
 occur. Only the time taken en-route   
 remains the same.                     
 Many of us are away from home for 12  
 hours each day; but few would leave   
 Bookham because of the attractions of 
 our community in the evenings and at  
 weekends.                             </content>
