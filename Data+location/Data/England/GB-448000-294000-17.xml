		<content> There are                             
 unfortunately no sports               
 centres in the immediate area.However 
 there is one in the nearby village of 
 Huncote.There are tennis courts in the
 area as well as football and cricket  
 facilities.Most sports ,however, are  
 better served in the towns and        
 villages nearby.There is considerable 
 interesT in gardening in the area and 
 the local vegetable and flower shows  
 are well attended with judges of the  
 Leicester Show attending .The arts and
 crafts in the area are , when         
 possible,undertaken in the community  
 centres as evening classes.Similarly  
 any indoor sports are catered for in  
 these centres.Games such as badminton 
 are catered in this way.Swimming a    
 popular activity, is served in the    
 town of Hinckley or at Enderby sports 
 centre.                               </content>
