		<title>13TOURISM SURVEY (1)</title>
		<content>    This survey was undertaken by 3rd. 
 Year pupils from Grainville School    
 interviewing people at{Gorey Harbour  
 and{Gorey Village.                    
                                       
    Of the people interviewed 116 were 
 visitors and 20 were local residents. 
 The reason for the greater number of  
 visitors is that this is an important 
{tourist area.}The interviews were     
 conducted at the end of June which is 
 nearing the peak of the tourist       
 season. The visitors came from a      
 variety of places ranging from        
 England to Sweden, Austria, Holland   
 and Canada.The greatest number came   
 from London, Surrey and Scotland      
 followed by Somerset, Hampshire and   
 Northern England.
