		<content> I live on the Lakeside estate. I like 
the park over by the Witches Hat. Ilike
living in my house because it is a     
modern one. Sunday is boring as nobody 
comes out and theres never anything to 
do. Nearly all the children at our     
school live too far away so I play with
the children on our street. Sometimes  
we go to Bankroft Park or play         
rounders at the bottom of our street.  
Many of our neighbours are community   
members and plan Sports Days and things
like that. I think there should be more
parks and places to play. When I get   
bored I usually make things like       
little cushions. Sometimes I wish I    
lived in a bigger house because there  
are only three bedrooms in ours. I     
have to share a room with my brother.
