 Fugelmere, a bird haunted mere. It was
 mentioned along with Datchet in the   
 original Domesday Survey. It has      
 always been surrounded by pasture     
 rather than arable land. The original 
 church was built on marshy land and   
 rebuilt on it's preent site in 1610.

 there. The village pub sprung up from 
 the workmen's hut at the time of the  
 rebuilding.
