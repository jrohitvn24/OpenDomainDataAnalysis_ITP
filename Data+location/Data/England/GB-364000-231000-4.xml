		<title>04Cider Production</title>
		<content> In Much Marcle there is a large cider 
 making factory called Westons where a 
 lot of people from the village work.  
 The factory was started in 1880 by    
 Henry Weston and his family have made 
 cider ever since then.Cider is made   
 from cider apples that come from cider
 apples that come from the local       
 orchards.Kingston black is the best   
 cider apple for cider production.The  
 factory starts to make cider in       
 september and all the time you can    
 watch the tractors and trailers taking
 the apples to Westons.To make the     
 cider the apples are washed, chopped  
 and crushed to get the juice out.The  
 juice is fermented in huge vats to    
 make cider.My father works at Westons 
 delivering cider all over the country.
 He goes to places like                
 London,Manchester, Southhampton and   
 Exeter.Dad enjoys working at Westons. </content>
