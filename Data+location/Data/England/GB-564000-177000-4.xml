		<content>{   West Tilbury}is a small,old        
 village.Its population has remained at
 about the same number for the past 200
 years,although it is no longer        
 self-sufficient.It has a Post         
 Office/food shop and a pub. called    
 "The King's Head" which stand either  
 side of the{village green}with the{   
 road running alongside.               
    The two farms date from medieval   
 times and have both recently been     
 renovated although keeping their origi
 nal styles.{Condovers,}which is the   
 farm to the west of the church, has   
 given land to be used as a Scout,     
 Cub,Guide, and Brownie camp.The school
 was forced to close from lack of      
 numbers.There is a thriving           
 village hall and a flint-built        
 church, St.James.The tower of this is 
 now unsafe and only the small         
 graveyard is in use.                  </content>
