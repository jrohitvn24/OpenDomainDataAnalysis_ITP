		<title>20WILD FLOWERS AROUND ROXWELL</title>
		<content>     More wild flowers can be seen     
 along the edges of the road as these  
 are not trimmed so often. In the early
 summer the cow parsley grows to a     
 height of about one metre.Later on Dog
 Roses cover parts of the hedges making
 a colourful display. The Campion is   
 another common wild flower, with      
 Shepherd's Purse, Poppy, Mayweed,     
 Thistles, Speedwell, Goosegrass, and  
 Hedge Mustard. Towards the end of     
 summer Rose-Bay Willowherb is seen    
 along the sides of the road.          
                                       
     The common trees in the area are  
 the {OAK, HAWTHORN, HORSE CHESTNUT,   
{WILLOW, ASH}and{FIELD MAPLE}in the    
 hedges. Dutch Elm Disease has killed  
 many trees. Some farmers are planting 
 young trees to replace others.
