		<content> Guides meet at the Parish Hall. We    
 meet on a Wednesday at seven. Any girl
 can join but has to be over eleven.   
 When enrolled we wear a uniform, which
 is a royal blue blouse, navy skirt and
 hat. Each troop wears a different     
 coloured necker and is divided        
 into patrols. When we meet we get out 
 our patrol boxes which contain such   
 things as a ball, books, puzzles,     
 paper, pencils and crayons. Each      
 evening we talk together with our     
 leader and learn things such as       
 campcraft, and we work towards our    
 proficiency badges. We also play      
 games. I enjoy guides because it is   
 something different to do and in the  
 summer we can go to camp. Each meeting
 lasts for two hours, and we pay a     
 monthly subscription of fifty pence.  
 At the end of guides we say a prayer  
 and then go home.                     </content>
