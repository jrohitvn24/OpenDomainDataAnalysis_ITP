		<content> This contribution to the BBC's        
 Domesday Project was prepared by      
 Badingham Women's Institute. Six of   
 our members - Carol Bostock-Smith,    
 Lilian Carter, Joan Dean, Jocelyne    
 Firth, Dorothy Sparrow &amp; Pamela       
 Waller - carried out the survey. We   
 would like to thank Mrs. Mary         
 Williams, former Headmistress of      
 Dennington VCP School, whose intimate 
 knowledge of Dennington &amp; enthusiastic
 participation in the project were     
 invaluable. Among the husbands who    
 gave helpful advice &amp; encouragement,  
 our special thanks must go to Mike    
 Bostock-Smith for making available his
 computer &amp; his expertise; also to     
 Errol Firth who duplicated the        
 questionnaires. Our thanks also to    
 those Badingham &amp; Dennington residents
 who completed the questionnaire, thus 
 making the survey possible.           </content>
