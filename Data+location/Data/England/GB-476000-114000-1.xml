		<title>01The Downs Around Compton</title>
		<content> The area covers part of the           
 picturesque South Downs.  It is aa    
 farming area of gentle hills and      
 slopes, parts of which are wooded and 
 the land is used for crop rotation and
 grazing.  There are two Downland      
 villages.  Compton lies between       
 Compton Down and Telegraph Hill, has a
 village square with village stores -  
 post office and 'pub' and nearby a    
 church and 2 primary schools. A mile  
 further north is a Boarding school for
 maladjusted children.  Up Marden      
 consists of only a few houses and a   
 church.  Of archealogical interest one
 can see some tumuli on Fernbeds Down  
 and between these and Telegraph Hill  
 a Long Barrow called 'Bevis's Thumb'. 
 The local water supply comes from     
 Apple Down where there is an          
 underground reservoir.
