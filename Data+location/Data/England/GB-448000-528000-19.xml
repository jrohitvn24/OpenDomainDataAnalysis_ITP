   The west and south western edges of 
 this area are farmland. No one farm is
 entirely within the area, but there   
 are large parts of Claxton Grange and 
 Owton Grange farms.                   
   The local farms are of average size 
 for this country, around{250}hectares.
 They are mixed farms, like most in    
 Northern England. The landscape of the
 farmland is fairly flat, at about{30  
 metres above sea level. It is the     
 local climate, with its short growing 
 season and lower summer temperatures  
 that leads farmers to keep a range of 
 crops and animals.                    
   The main crops are Barley, Oil Seed 
 Rape, Wheat and Potatoes. A large part
 of most farms is given to grazing     
 land, while hay is grown as winter    
 feed.                                 </content>
