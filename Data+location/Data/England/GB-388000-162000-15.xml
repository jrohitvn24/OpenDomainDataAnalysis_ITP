		<title>15FASHION/MUSIC IN MELKSHAM</title>
		<content>   Fashion and pop music are very      
 closely linked.  A lot of the current 
 trends in clothing and hair styles    
 amongst the younger generation follow 
 the more successful pop groups.       
   Duran Duran, probably the most      
 successful group around today give    
 fashion and clothes a clean-cut and   
 tidy image, whereas Boy George and    
 Culture Club dress in rags and wear   
 make-up which makes it hard to tell   
 whether they are male or female.      
 Other groups influence fashions such  
 as Skinheads, who werar tight jeans,  
 large boots and who shave their heads.
 Punks have brightly coloured hair,    
 dark clothing and use chains and      
 safety pins as jewelry, even through  
 the nose.  One notable thing about pop
 music today is that it is being used  
 as a means to raise mone for disasters
 like the Ethiopian famine.            </content>
