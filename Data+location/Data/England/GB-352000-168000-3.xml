		<title>03SHOPS IN LONG ASHTON</title>
		<content> In Long Ashton there are only a few   
 shops on the main road, but down a    
 side road there is a parade of shops. 
 There are no large shops,apart from a 
 'Gateway' supermarket. They are all   
 small private concerns. In 'Gateway'  
 we go around the shop, picking food   
 and cleaning materials from the       
 shelves and putting them in a basket  
 or trolley. On each item there is a   
 sticky label showing its price.The    
 shops I visit most are the post       
 office, because my mum is a post lady;
 the newsagents, to collect my comics; 
 and 'Homes and Gardens', because I am 
 a keen gardener. Other shops include  
 an antique shop, an off-licence, a    
 Chinese take-away and a hairdresser's.
 Everywhere there is a friendly        
 service.
