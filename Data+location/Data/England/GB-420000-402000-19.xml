		<title>19A DAY IN THE LIFE OF STEVEN</title>
		<content> school. Before play we do maths,      
 reading laboratory and handwriting.   
 Then we go to assembly. The teacher   
 reads us a story about things that go 
 wrong. Then it's playtime. Rob gets   
 his frisby and we play catch on the   
 field. The frisby comes towards me but
 the wind gets hold of it and it sails 
 up on the roof. We ask the teacher if 
 we can get it down. Dingerlingerling! 
 The bell goes. Back to work. We do    
 geography, spelling and watch a TV    
 programme. At 11.30 we write a horror 
 story called "All Dead", with Dracula 
 and Frankenstein. Dingerling! Save my 
 day! The dinner bell goes at last! We 
 have jelly and blancmange for afters. 
 Out to play for a game of rounders. My
 team wins 10 to 8. I scored 4 of them.
 Back into school a bit early to get   
 the painting equipment out. I paint a 
 picture of our rounders game and stay </content>
