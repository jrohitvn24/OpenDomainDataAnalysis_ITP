		<content> I  hate lunch times because you spend 
 half the break queueing and the other 
 half eating.In Art and Craft I        
 finished my collage and made Christmas
 decorations.                          
  At 15.30 Emma and I sprinted home and
 got back in 5 minutes.At home Emma    
 stayed at my house to play.It was     
 really good because we made tropical  
 fruit drinks,and watched T.V. It was  
 really funny.At 16.30 Emma went home.I
 changed into my football kit and at   
 18.00 I went to football practice with
 Stephanie Heath.We got very           
 cold,wet and tired but it was good.At 
 20.00 we went home.I got really       
 bored.I had my tea and then I watched 
 Channel Four news.Channel Four news is
 really interesting.Today they had a   
 special on Anti-Apartheid.I watched   
 the news till 20.30 then I went to    
 bed.                                  </content>
