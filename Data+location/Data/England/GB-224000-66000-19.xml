		<title>19St.Cleer Carnival.</title>
		<content>      St Cleer Carnival is an annual   
 event held during July. Leading up to 
 the Carnival itself are various       
 activities,  such as the all-important
 choosing of the Carnival Queen and her
 attendants. The week begins with a    
 Fashion Show on Monday and a village  
 Street Dance on Tuesday. On Wednesday 
 we have a Sports Night. There is a    
 Senior Citizens' Lunch on Thursday    
 followed by a Junior Disco. On Friday 
 we have a Fun Run through the village.
  The Carnival assembles at the Horizon
 Egg Farm on Saturday evening. The     
 walkers and floats then prepare for   
 the 3 km procession through the       
 village led by the Liskeard Silver    
 Band. They pass through Shortacross,  
 Tremar, Well Lane and Fore Street.    
 Prizes are presented finally on St.   
 Cleer Downs.  The money collected goes
 towards the Memorial Hall Fund.       </content>
