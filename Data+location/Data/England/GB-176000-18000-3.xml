		<title>03VILLAGE HOMES</title>
		<content> Coverack has some two-hundred houses  
 and bungalows; many of them homes for 
 people who have chosen to retire to   
 the village. Some forty houses are not
 lived in for nine months of the year. 
 These houses are second homes for     
 people living in other parts of the   
 country, or whose owners rent them out
 during the summer season as holiday   
 homes. This gives rise to some concern
 amongst local people, for there is    
 little prospect that planning         
 approval would be given for building  
 more homes, and house prices are      
 inflated by reason of the popularity  
 of the area. The young people of the  
 village, after marrying, have slight  
 chance of continuing to live in the   
 area in which they were born. The age 
 of the population is increasing as    
 gradually the young men and women move
 out to seek work and homes elsewhere. </content>
