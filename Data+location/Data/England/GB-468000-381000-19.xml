		<title>19Trade:Market Day in Retford</title>
		<content> Being a busy housewife with two small 
 children my food and clothing         
 allowance is very tight.{Thursday and}
{Saturday markets}are therefore ideal  
 for{basic shopping}needs.Both markets 
 are equipped with vegetables,fresh    
 fish and flower stalls:babies,men's   
 and women's clothing:shoes,linen and  
 towels:birthday cards and gift        
 paper.The odd luxury stalls sell      
 jewellery,leather goods and cosmetics.
 Carpets,pottery,D.I.Y,wool            
 fabrics,habadashery are also sold.    
 In contrast{,Friday market}is more    
 specialised,selling                   
 ;bric-a-brak,brass,second-hand books  
 and clothing:a market designed mainly 
 with the collector in mind.           
{Market day attracts buyers}from the   
 outlying villages who enjoy a day's   
 shopping.Small cafes and              
 newsagents benefit from{casual trade.}</content>
