 we saw were in an old quarry.Along the
 path were dead trees which{Mr Joint   
 said were to encourage more wildlife  
 in to the Quarry.Already there are    
 moles,shrews and ants and many more   
 birds coming back into the quarry.{   
{Joint Mitnor}was our next stop and    
 inside was a bone desposit which is   
 unique.It is the only cave in{Europe  
 in which these very important deposits
 have been left in the{talus}formation 
 so that you can see the bones and     
 skeletons.We saw the tooth of a baby  
{straight-toothed elephant}which was   
 the size of a cucumber.After{Joint    
{Mitnor}we went along a path and into  
 the museum to see some primitive tools
 and skeletons found in the caves.
