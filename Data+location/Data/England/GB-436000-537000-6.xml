		<content>    Wingate Grange Farm covers a total 
 area of{700 acres}made up from a      
 number of smaller areas{around Wingate
{and}the nearby village of{Blackhall.  
 The present owner has farmed there for
 fifteen years but could not supply    
 details of its history.               
    The farm concentrates{mainly}in the
 areas of{arable farming and beef      
 production. To compensate for the poor
 summer weather the farmer has invested
 in a{large drying shed}to reduce the  
 moisture content of the grain.        
    Two types of{cattle}are kept,      
{charolais}and{fresian,}the former for 
 beef and the latter for milk as a     
 supplementary product.                
   {Fir trees}are grown as a{cash crop 
 in the form of{Christmas Tree         
   {Equipment}includes a selection of  
{tractors,}a{combined harvester}and a  
{small aircraft}for crop spraying.     </content>
