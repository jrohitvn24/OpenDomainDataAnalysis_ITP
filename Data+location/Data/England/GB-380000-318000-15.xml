		<content>  There are 6 police constables and a  
segeant in charge at Gnosall. Vandalism
is the most common crime and young     
people between the ages of 12 and 20   
years are usually responsible. When    
vandals are caught the police either   
give a caution or start court action.  
  Gnosall police believe that it is    
important to get to know all the people
living on their "beat", and to try to  
help them with their problems.         
  Not all of their work is done in     
uniform. The police do periods of time 
with the C.I.D. when they wear leisure 
clothes.                               
  The village policemen get called out 
about 6 times a day, an average of     
about 40 times a week.                 
  One of the areas to be investigated  
by police in the Gnosall area is       
complaints about cruelty to farm       
animals.                               </content>
