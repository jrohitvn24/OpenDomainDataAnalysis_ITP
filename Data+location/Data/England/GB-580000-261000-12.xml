		<title>12Life In Bury-1920's. Jayne</title>
		<content>Mr. B. was born in a house in Cannon   
St. He had no bathroom, his family used
a tin bath in front of the fire which  
was made from coal. There was no       
central heating. The only water tap was
in the yard and 12 families had to     
share it. The toilet was outside the   
house too. Some homes had gas lights   
and some people used parafin lamps.    
Everyone used candles. They were very  
cheap.                                 
The outskirts of Bury were:            
East.....Hollow Rd.                    
South....The gaol in Sicklesmere Rd.   
West.....The Spread Eagle Inn.         
North....The Tollgate Inn.             
The town was completely surrounded by  
fields. It was quiet and children could
play in the streets safely because     
there was very little traffic. There   
were few car parks and no Traffic      
Wardens.                               </content>
