Somerleyton green is in the middle of  
Somerleyton. There are nineteen        
houses. Nine of the houses have        
porches. Two of the house have         
greenhouses. The houses belong to Lord 
Somerleyton. People that live in them  
rent the houses from him. Parts of the 
houses are wooden. They have lattice   
windows and there are bird tables in   
the gardens.                           
Somerleyton Hall                       
Somerleyton Hall has pretty gardens    
that you can walk round. It has a      
miniature railway and maze. You can go 
in the house and look round. In the    
gardens, some of the trees are 200     
years old. For the children, they have 
swings and things to play on.
