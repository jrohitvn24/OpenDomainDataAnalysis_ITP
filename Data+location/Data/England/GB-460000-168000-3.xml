		<title>03THEALE BY-PASS</title>
		<content> The Theale by-pass allows access to   
 and from the M4(Junction 12) and the  
 main Reading road. The by-pass was    
 built to reduce the number of vehicles
 travelling through Theale village. 762
 vehicles went onto the Theale by-pass 
 from the roundabout. 18 had come from 
 Wigmore Lane, 480 from the            
 A4(Thatcham), 245 from the A340, 11   
 from the A4(Theale) and 8 had gone    
 once round the roundabout. 522        
 vehicles went onto the roundabout     
 from the Theale by-pass. 29 went      
 to Wigmore Lane, 270 wto the          
 A4(Thatcham), 195 to the A340, 20     
 to the A4(Theale) and 8 had gone      
 once round the roundabout. The Theale 
 by-pass has been effective in removing
 the through traffic from Theale       
 village. At present the roundabout can
 cope effectively with the traffic even
 during the times of peak usage.       </content>
