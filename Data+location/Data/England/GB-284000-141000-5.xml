		<title>05Stoke Pero Church</title>
		<content> Stoke Pero Church is a small church   
 1013 feet above sea level on Exmoor.  
 It has a Beautiful decorated timber   
 roof but is otherwise quite plain. The
 tower has three bells and the organ   
 was built in the U.S.A. The church was
 restored between 1820 and 1870.       
     There are many evidences that the 
 church has always had a very small    
 congregation. Among 24 or so          
 gravestones in the churchyard we      
 counted only 9 different surnames. No 
 Rector was appointed between 1675 and 
 1804 and the original dedication of   
 the church is unknown. It is now      
 dedicated to St. Peter because of his 
 associations with a rock and sheep.   
     The Rector of Porlock is in charge
 and a service is held once a month in 
 this beautiful setting.
