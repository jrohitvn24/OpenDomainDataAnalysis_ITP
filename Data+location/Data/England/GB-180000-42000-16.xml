		<content> Truro has many religious denominations
 represented in it.There is a Bishop of
 Truro, leading an Anglican diocese, in
 the catholic tradition. The Church of 
 England High Church tradition is      
 upheld by All Saints, Highertown; and 
 on weekdays at St Kea Church,can      
 be seen the more emotional outpourings
 of the charismatic style, this has    
 roots in the 18th Century influence of
 John Wesley and Billy Bray. Apart from
 the Cathedral, the Churches in Truro  
 reflect national figures showing low  
 church attendance. Only 170 people in 
 St Kea of a population of 1250 are    
 even on the Church Electoral Roll. In 
 rural areas, and close communities,   
 attendances tend to be higher. Freedom
 of Worship means people may choose    
 which Church they attend, irrespective
 of parish boundaries. Services in the 
 Cathedral are very well-attended.     </content>
