		<content>    We also made a survey of travel to 
 these leisure pursuits for pupils.    
            {Bus Bike  Walk   Car Train
 1 Ridgeway  29%   6%   40%   24%    1%
 2 St. Jos.  17%   7%   30%   46%    0%
 3 Our Lady  34%   6%   21%    3%   36%
 4 Manor     22%   4%   66%    8%    0%
            {26%   6%   39%   20%    9%
                                       
    No real differences for secondary  
 pupils (Ridgeway) and junior pupils   
 But large differences using private &amp; 
 public transport. Note use of cars for
 schools 2,3,4, and use of train &amp; bus 
 by school 3. It reflects poorer income
 areas for schools 3&amp;4 (fewer cars) but
 also shows public transport provision 
 between areas of city. Where trains or
 buses are plentiful they are well used
 by children to get to leisure pursuits
 Planners note! (Compare Amenity survey
 -bus services sqs. 3&amp;4 with sq. 10.   </content>
