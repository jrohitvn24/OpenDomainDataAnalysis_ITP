		<title>07ELMBRIDGE - GENERAL FARMING</title>
		<content> A pig farm can be found in the area.  
 There is a broiler unit for 1100      
 chickens and a turkey unit for a 1000 
 birds. The land is largely owned by   
 the occupiers. Many farms are a family
 concern where it is hoped that a son  
 will follow his father. A number of   
 farm houses have been sold off with a 
 few acres,to business men. A fourteen 
 acre Equestrian Centre with twenty    
 four loose boxes has an indoor and    
 outdoor school. A farrier living at   
 Cooksey Green travels with a mobile   
 forge where needed. An agricultural   
 contractor undertakes all types of    
 work from combine harvesting,         
 hedge-cutting to ploughing. All his   
 cars and tractors are in contact with 
 the house by citizen band to help with
 the organisation of the work. Many    
 farmers make use of this contractor   
 thus saving on there own labour.      </content>
