		<content> As far as recreational facilities for 
 children go, the area is very well    
 served.There are many small play areas
 some with swings and slides, some with
 grassy areas but others with football 
 pitches while the  new Fordton Leisure
 centre offers a wide variety  of      
 recreational facilities for old and   
 young alike.Here there are swimming   
 pools, saunas, facilities for squash, 
 table tennis and other indoor games,  
 and popmobility, which is very        
 popular.At Fordton, sports courses and
 coaching sessions for children are    
 organised  during  school holidays.   
 Courses are also organised at the     
 Studio at Padgate.The studio was      
 opened in 1982 as part of the dual_use
 Padgate District Centre(facilities are
 shared with school).These include     
 Drama Studio, sports hall , hard      
 porous pitch with floodlighting etc.  </content>
