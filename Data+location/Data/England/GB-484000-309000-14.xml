		<title>14THE CANAL</title>
		<content> The canal started in 1703 was intended
 to link Melton Mowbray with Oakham.It 
 reached Oakham in 1802 and cost #70000
 to build.All that remains now is a    
 short stretch either side of the      
 Langham to Burley Road,between the    
 Ashwell to Oakham Road and the        
 railway.It is used for coarse fishing 
 by members of the Oakham Angling      
 Society who maintain what is left of  
 the canal.The fish caught are roach,  
 perch and pike.The land around the    
 canal is mostly cereals and grazing,  
 the grazing mostly belonging to the   
 Cottesmore Hunt Kennels at whose      
 buildings the northern end of the     
 canal terminates.The canal passes     
 under the Langham to Burley Road about
 30 metres from the railway line,which 
 itself passes over the same road by   
 means of a level crossing.The railway 
 is the Birmingham-East Coast line.    </content>
