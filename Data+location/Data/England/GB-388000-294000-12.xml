		<title>12Life Style Mark's Day</title>
		<content>Every morning my mom drags me out of a 
nice warm bed. I pick my clothes up and
stagger downstairs. It is 7.45 when I  
switch on the heating and get dressed. 
Then in comes my mom who turns on the  
radio, Mike Read again-boring! She asks
us what we want for breakfast, my      
sister has "Shreddies" and I have      
"Ready Brek". After breakfast I go into
my room and pack my bag, then I clean  
my teeth.                              
I walk to school with my friends. At   
school I get the piano ready for       
assembly which is at 9.00.Then we have 
our lessons like maths in which we are 
doing percentages at present. During   
the day we have a break in the morning 
when we have our milk and a break at   
lunchtime when we have school dinners. 
My favourite lesson is swimming when   
we are taken by coach to the local     
baths. School finishes at 3.45.        </content>
