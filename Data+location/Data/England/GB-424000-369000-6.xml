		<content> For the people who live at{Chatsworth}
 the year is sharply divided between   
 the seven months when the House and   
 gardens are open and the five winter  
 months when both are closed. About a  
 quarter of a million people see round 
 it from March to October. During that 
 time the staff are busy with the      
 routine work which such a big house   
 and so many visitors require. There is
 also the day to day maintenance of the
 fabric of the building, inside and    
 out. In winter the big cleaning takes 
 place and any restoration necessary in
 the public rooms. In spite of its vast
 size the house has a wonderful        
 atmosphere and is very much a house,  
 both to us and to the six other       
 families who have appartments there.  
 The beauty of the house, its situation
 and the things in it are a continual  
 joy which none of us take for granted.</content>
