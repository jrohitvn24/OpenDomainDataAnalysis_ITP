 A SURVEY OF THE BUILDINGS IN THE AREA 
  PROVIDED A NUMBER OF INTERESTING     
 STYLES AND MATERIALS. THE AREA DOES   
 NOT HAVE A PLENTIFUL  SUPPLY OF STONE 
 TO BE QUARRIED INN THE TRADITIONAL    
 WAY.A METHOD OF BUILDING WAS  DEVISED 
 HUNDREDS OF YEARS AGO TO MAKE USE OF  
 THE  FLINT CHUNKS THAT ARE FOUND JUST 
 BELOW THE SURFACE OVER THE ENTIRE     
 AREA. KNOWN AS "FLINT RUBBLE" THE     
 BUILDINGS   CONSTRUCTED FROM THIS     
 MATERIAL HAVE A VERY DISTINCTIVE      
 APPEARANCE.AN EXCELLENT EXAMPLE       
 OF THIS   METHOD IS TO BE FOUND IN THE
 PARISH CHURCH OF NAZEING .THE ORIGINAL
 CHURCH BUILT AROUND 1060  OF STONE    
 OBTAINED FROM THE RIVER LEE,STILL     
 STANDS TODAY.
