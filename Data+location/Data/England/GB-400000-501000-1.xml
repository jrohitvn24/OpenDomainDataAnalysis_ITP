{________________________________}     
 Most of the area is within the        
 boundaries of the{North Yorkshire     
{National Park}and lies on the eastern 
 slopes of the{Pennines.}The moorland  
 is used for sheep rearing and grouse  
 shooting. Many of the buildings are   
 farm houses and barns. All of the     
 buildings are made from local stone   
 and the roofs are covered with stone  
 slabs. There have been no new houses  
 built in the dale in the last hundred 
 years. There are no fences or hedges, 
 the land is divided and enclosed by   
 dry stone walls.                      
 The{Arkle Beck}winds in a south-      
 easterly direction through the area.  
 The river is bordered by meadowland   
 and mixed woodland. There is a large  
 variety of wild flowers and birds.
