		<title>11The Spike Age</title>
		<content> The{lifestyle}of{teenagers}is depicted
 by herds of them walking around the   
 town with their hair ten feet in the  
 sky, with sticky gel smeared on it to 
 make it stay there. And if that is not
 enought, it is red, blue, pink or     
 green. This style is called mohican.  
 Someone has even thought of the idea  
 to create{hair styles}to look like    
 snooker tables, ice cream cones or    
 even a cricket square with wickets and
 a ball. But for those who are not so  
 adventurous, long hair is back in{    
{fashion}and there is a craze to have  
 hair 'permed'. Clothes are very       
 simple. You can adapt what you like   
 such as curtains or Dad's old shirts  
 and trousers to look very fashionable.
 The colours are usually very dark, but
 for summer this year (1985), people   
 have gone for light garments.
