		<title>17BBC TELEVISION STUDIOS</title>
		<content> In 1984 the BBC took over this site   
 from Central Television to relieve    
 pressure on their London studios,     
 particularly in the production of a   
 twice weekly drama serial called      
{"Eastenders".}The building occupies   
 premises dating back to early film    
 making in 1914 together with a studio 
 used by{Douglas Fairbanks Jnr.}to make
 programmes for American Television in 
 the 1950's. There are now two full    
 T.V. studios, two sound stages and    
 complete technical facilities together
 with scenery and costume stores. There
 is also an outside lot of 1.4 acres on
 which a set of Victorian houses has   
 been constructed for the Eastenders   
 series. In addition to this serial,   
 and other{light entertainment         
 production, the studios are the centre
 of BBC television{training}courses.
