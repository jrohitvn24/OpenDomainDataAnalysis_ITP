 stamps and sticker collecting.        
{MUSIC:}I play 3rd cornet. I am in the 
 school band &amp; Loxley Methodist Silver 
 Prize Band. I practise over 4 hours a 
 week. With Loxley Band we play in     
 concerts in &amp; out of Sheffield. I also
 play the bugle at Trinity Church.     
{FOOTBALL:}I play for Sheffield Rangers
 &amp; Sheffield Boys. To get in I had to  
 get through 5 trials from 150 people  
 from all over the city. We have a     
 chance of winning 4 medals &amp; have     
 already won 2 cups.                   
{SWIMMING:}We train every night and    
 before school for galas all over the  
 UK. I am one of the 6 fastest in the  
 city &amp; I have been picked to go to    
 Holland in August as an international 
 swimmer. It is not a hobby it is hard 
 work !
