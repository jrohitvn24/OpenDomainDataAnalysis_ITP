		<title>18JESUS CHURCH</title>
		<content> Our school church is one of only two  
 churches in the country called Jesus  
 Church . Though closed for some three 
 years because of serious damage by    
 dry-rot, the church should reopen in  
 September 1985.                       
 The building, now 150 years old,      
 contains wooden pews and stained glass
 windows with pictures of Mary and     
 Jesus.                                
 As a result of the damage, the old    
 wooden beams have to be removed and   
 replaced with steel trusses. The money
 needed, some Â£110,000, was raised by  
 local effort. It is reckoned that less
 than 10% of the general population    
 actually attend church services       
 nowadays.                             
 When work is finished, the church will
 be officially re-opened by the Bishop 
 at a special ceremonial service.
