		<title>02Housing Survey 1985.</title>
		<content> Parents of children in some of our    
 local primary schools took part in a  
 survey to find out about housing in   
 our area. We found that{51%}of        
 families lived in{semi-detached       
{houses, 32%}in{detached}and the rest  
 in{terraced houses, flats or cottages.
                                       
 Most families{(79%)}had lived in their
 houses for 10 years or less. Almost   
 all the houses{(96%)}had gardens and  
 most{(58%)}had garages.               
                                       
 This suggests an area of{suburban}    
 housing almost all with{gardens}and   
 many with{garages.                    
                                       
 Most families expressed themselves as 
 being{'satisfied'}or{'very satisfied' 
 with their houses.
