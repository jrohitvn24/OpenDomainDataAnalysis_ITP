		<title>19FARMING AND HEDGES</title>
		<content>  From the East Anglian Daily Times    
6/6/85                                 
  A Somersham farmer claims he is being
 orced to bulldoze 400 yds of hedge    
growth for economical reasons.But      
villagers say he's out to destroy      
footpaths on his land.Someone said the 
hedge will be disapearing in a few days
She said that sometimes up to 80 people
from Somersham and Flowton walked the  
paths,and that once the hedge alongside
the path disapeared,"It's going to be  
 bsolute hell trying to walk up here"  
  Another resident who declined to be  
named said she was"horrifed" when she  
saw the trees had been cut down."It's  
only a small hedge but there is the    
most fabulous bank of cowslips in      
spring.                                
  The farmer said the hedge had to go  
beause of sheer economics.
