		<title>05FARMING IN HARVEL</title>
		<content> During the past 30 years this area has
 changed from dairying to mainly arable
 with some sheep. Only two herds       
 remain, one pedigree beef and one     
 dairy. E.E.C. subsidies have changed  
 the springtime green to the brilliant 
 yellow of oil-seed rape and many      
 hedges have disappeared to facilitate 
 the use of ever bigger machines.The   
 numerous roadside hedges are well     
 maintained and a haven for wildlife.  
 Mechanisation has increased the output
 by 300% over 30 years but this has    
 meant fewer farm workers employed.    
 This has caused the sale of numerous  
 farmhouses and cottages and the       
 amalgamation of local farms.  The     
 farms locally are between 70 and 180  
 acres now, mostly about 120 acres.    
 One farm employed 14 men 35 years ago 
 - now it will be hard put to employ   
 the second son.                       </content>
