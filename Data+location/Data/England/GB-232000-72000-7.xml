		<content> The Duchy of Cornwall was created     
 under the Great Charter of1337,and is 
 the oldest of English Duchies.It      
 exists to provide an income for the   
 Heir Apparent to the  Throne.The Duchy
 is governed by the Council of His     
 Royal Highness which determines       
 policy. The Prince of Wales is        
 Chairman.There is a resident Land     
 Agent.In thge past 5o years there have
 been many Royal visitors to the area. 
 The Duchy is the largest land owner,  
 holding 75% of the acreage,and many   
 properties.The current policy is to   
 modernise the agricultural estate.As  
 tennant farmers have retired,farm     
 houses and cottages have been sold,and
 and acreage increased on other farms. 
 In 1984 Duchy Home Farm with 45o acres
 was leased to Cornwall County Council 
 and is now run as an Agricultural     
 College.                              </content>
