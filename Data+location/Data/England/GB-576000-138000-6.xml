INTERVIEW BY MRS NUTTAL OF APPLETREE   
STABLES.                               
                                       
   The area consists of mostly         
Conservative people,although the       
population of the area is quite small. 
Mrs Nuttal has lived at Appletree      
Stables for about fifteen years,owning 
twenty-five horses and giving private  
riding lessons.                        
                                       
   She states that the land is         
poor,but has good drainage. The main   
industry is farming.There are quite a  
few grazing fields and a few fields    
used for arable farming eg.wheat and   
orchards.                              
                                       
   Trade is not very good and the      
nearest shopping-town is Cranbrook.
