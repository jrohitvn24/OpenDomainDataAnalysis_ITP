		<title>10WICK FARM,DITCHLING</title>
		<content> Take a walk over the Downs in June and
 you'll find many farms,small villages 
 and many wild flowers and crops.      
     The owner of Wick Farm started up 
 a vineyard three year's ago,which has 
 grown over several acres.             
     The owner has a good business with
 his wine crops,with names such as     
 Miller,Thurgall and Rishensteiner.    
     The owner has several animals on  
 Wick Farm which is seperate from the  
 vineyard.You will be able to buy      
 wine by the bottle.                   
     The vineyard produced 8 thousand  
 bottles in 1983,and in 1984, 24       
 thousand bottles.                     
     The main buyer's are hotels,      
 restaurants and people who visit the  
 vineyard.The sucess of the vineyard   
 comes from the sort of soil which is  
 lower chalk at the top and green sand 
 at the bottom.{                       </content>
