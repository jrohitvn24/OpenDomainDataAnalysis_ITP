		<title>07Farncombe Boathouse</title>
		<content>  The Boathouse is about 80 years old, 
 the same age as the lock further up   
 the river. The new boats now are up to
 65 feet long, but the old boats are 70
 feet long and 7 foot wide. 6 people   
 work at the Boathouse building and    
 repairing boats. The narrow boats     
 weigh up to 8-12 tonnes.One of the new
 boats carries up to 10 people. The    
 cost for hiring a boat for a week is  
 between Â£100-Â£350. The river starts at
 Eashing. The canal was built from     
 Guildford to Godalming in 1760 to join
 the River Thames 19 miles away. Narrow
 Boats were once used for heavy goods  
 and now they are used for holidays and
 pleasure.
