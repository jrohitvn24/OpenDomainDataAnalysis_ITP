		<title>15THE SCHOOL POSTMAN</title>
		<content> Mr Lock the school postman has been a 
 postman for 22 years.He told us it was
 a pleasant job being out in the fresh 
 air.{He gets up very early and cycles 
{the three miles to the sorting office 
{in Totton.}He aims to arrive in time  
 to start work at 6.a.m.Before he      
 starts his round he has to sort the   
 letters,a job that can take anything  
 from 1to2\ hours.When this has been   
 completed he sets off on his post     
 office bicycle to deliver the letters.
{He has approximately 430 homes to     
{visit on his round and will probably  
{deliver many thousand letters in a    
{week averaging a thousand a day.}He   
 usually finishes work at 12 noon and  
 works every day other than Sunday.    
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
