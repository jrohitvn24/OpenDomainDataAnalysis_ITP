   On Friday I went to Lincoln with Mum
 and Dad to have a look at some        
 wardrobes and wallpaper for my bedroom
 after that we went and looked at the  
 patio sets.We found one we liked as   
 well as two hall rugs.                
  On Saturday I went to the Water      
 Festival and Dad won a coconut.When we
 got home we had tea and watched       
 television for the rest of the night. 
  On Sunday we had pork chops,new      
 potatoes,sprouts,gravy and mint sauce.
  Later we went to the christening of  
 my cousin. The vicar was christening  
 three others at the same time. After, 
 we went to my aunty's house for       
 sandwiches, cakes and a drink of      
 sherry.                               
  Later we returned home and spent the 
 rest of the evening  watching         
 television.                           </content>
