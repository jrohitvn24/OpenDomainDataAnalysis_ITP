		<content> Lacemaking in Chinnor                 
   Chinnor lace was once extremely     
 famous and most village women         
 practised it. However, this craft is  
 now only pursued by one or two women, 
 and now only as a hobby. In the       
 19C. lacemaking was a flourishing     
 cottage industry with Lace Schools    
 etc. Older women would train and      
 instruct young girls in the craft.    
 Sydenham Crafts                       
   There are still two lacemakers      
 living in Sydenham who display their  
 work locally.                         
   In Sydenham a man makes reproduction
 furniture, while another restores     
 antiques; one lady does smocking, an  
 additional woman, needlework. There   
 are two women who spin wool, one for  
 weaving, the other for knitting. There
 is a potter also in Sydenham village.
