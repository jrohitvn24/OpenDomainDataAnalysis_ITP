		<content> I came to live at Barnardiston when my
 father was appointed Rector of All    
 Saints church in 1898 and my childhood
 was spent there.Ithen left the        
 village,but returned in 1939,and I    
 have seen many changes.People used to 
 work very hard and had little         
 money,but were very happy.The fields  
 were smaller and all the work was done
 by men and horses,not the large       
 machines we have now.Children left    
 school at 14 to work in the fields or 
 go into service.                      
    I often think that children today  
 are like the "Lady of Shallot" in     
 Tennyson's poem,but instead of looking
 into a mirror we look  at television  
 and everything happens behind our     
 back!
