		<content> In 1941 the school was taken over by  
 the state.Until 1945 children up to 14
 years of age went to the school.In    
 that year it changed status to a      
 primary school.Then in 1973 it became 
 a first school in the educational     
 re-organisation that took place in    
 Buckinghamshire.                      
 In the past the children all came from
 the locality.The opposite is true     
 today with all 30 children on roll    
 coming in to the school from nearby   
 districts.The headteacher gives the   
 reason of a small friendly school as  
 to its continual popularity.One       
 example of this community is the fact 
 that every child stays to school      
 dinners.                              
 A first school in Bucks. caters from  
 rising fives to eight year olds.
