		<title>06WALTON HEATH (THE COMMON)</title>
		<content>  Walton Heath is common land. Many    
people use the common. They play       
football, walk their dogs, and         
practise cricket or golf. Fifth Stone  
Scouts and Cubs meet in their new      
prefabricated building.                
  On our field trip we saw rabbits, a  
grey squirrel, house martins nesting in
a disused barn and a kestrel hovering. 
We heard a cuckoo nearby and disturbed 
a barn owl on Walton House Farm.       
  Wildflowers included Red Campion,    
Tufted Vetch, Cow Parsely and St.      
John's Wort. There were Oak, Ash,      
Hawthorn, Beech, Willow and Holly      
trees. Some oaks had oak galls on them.
Insects we identified were ladybirds, a
burying beetle and aphids. We saw a Red
Admiral and a number of Large White    
butterflies.
