 water sports. A rowing club, two      
 sailing clubs and several{sub-aqua    
{diving}clubs are active there.        
 A wind surfing school caters for both 
 beginners and more advanced           
 enthusiasts. Canoe groups, scouts and 
 sea cadets all use the facilities.    
 To the west of the Gelt, near Low Gelt
 Bridge, the{East Cumbria Motor Cycle  
{Club}meet for scrambling. The adult   
 section numbering about 100 members,  
 meets five times a year.              
 The schoolboys, with about the same   
 membership, meet six times a year.    
 Members are from Cumbria and South    
 West Scotland. There is a club        
 championship with money and trophy    
 prizes to be won. On a good day as    
 many as 1000 spectators are present.  
 Occasionally a car club uses the site 
 for trials.                           </content>
