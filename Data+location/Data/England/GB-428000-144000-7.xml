		<title>07WEYHILL POLICE.</title>
		<content>   James McNiven, living in Weyhill, is
 the local policeman. As he was on     
 holiday we spoke to Ted Reynolds who  
 shared the area with him during the   
 miners' strike. In his view villages  
 are becoming dormitories in which he  
 can only conduct enquiries between    
 6pm. and 8pm.. Before and after that  
 people tend to be out. Police work is 
 concerned largely with traffic. The   
 A303 at Weyhill is a bottleneck and   
 there are between 12 &amp; 15 serious     
 accidents a year. The new road will   
 provide 100% relief. The Thruxton     
 Circuit necessitates the policing of  
 the 12 events a year and local        
 parachutists sometimes need rescuing. 
 Burglary falls into two catagories:   
 that organised by professional thieves
 attracted by antiques and opportunist 
 thefts from parked cars at tourist    
 attractions. WRVS give victim support.</content>
