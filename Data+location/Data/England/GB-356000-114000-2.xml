		<content> Two interesting features of{tourism   
 in the area are{the butterfly and silk
{farms in the grounds of Compton House.
 At the{Butterfly farm}there are about 
 500 different species of butterfly.   
 They come from all over the world from
 countries such as Maleus,Tanzania and 
 Peru. The biggest is Axelanduei. The  
 smallest is Cupido. They also keep    
 peacocks and silk worms. There are 4  
 permanent staff dealing with nearly   
 100,000 visitors in a year. The       
 butterflies are kept in natural       
 surroundings and feed on some exotic  
 plants. Silk is produced at the{silk  
{farm}from cocoons spun by silk worms. 
 Each year about 90,000 cocoons are    
 used to produce silk which is then    
 sent to clothing manufacturers. The   
 silk worms need little food so they   
 are easy  to keep.
