		<title>03HITCHIN MARKET (2)</title>
		<content>   In 1268 the market was established  
 at Bancroft, a wide street suitable   
 for a market. In the 19th century this
 proved a cause of annoyance. Local    
 farmers and dealers complained about  
 the lack of accomodation for the      
 livestock, the number of cattle       
 increased but the pens decreased. The 
 reason was the opening of a new       
 road,to the station,Hermitage Road.By 
 1857 a request was made for a plot of 
 land between West Lane and Old Park   
 Road. It was then proposed to move the
 cattle to an 'out of town' site, but  
 this was eventually rejected in 1883  
 because of the cost. In 1903 new rules
 forced the market at Bancroft to      
 close. A new cattle market established
 at Nun's Close,this land was leased   
 for 99 years from Trinity College,    
 Cambridge.Today it is run as an       
 auction for produce and small animals.</content>
