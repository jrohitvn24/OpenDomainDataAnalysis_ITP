 beautiful. There are beautiful

 The house is called Benacre Hall. Sir 
 John lives there alone because his    
 father, Sir T.S. Gooch, has died and  
 his wife is also dead.                
   There are stables at the back of the
 house. At the front door there are    
 four pillars made of stone. In fact   
 the whole house is made of stone      
 except for the doors and the          
 windows.The front door is a double    
 door and when it is open it leaves a  
 big space.                            
   Our school has one of his talbots   
 above the main door.  Janet Liddell
