		<content> WOOTTON ST.LAWRENCE IS A TYPICAL SMALL
 VILLAGE UNTOUCHED AS YET BY           
 MODERNISATION.NEW BUILDING PROJECTS   
 HAVE BEEN UNDERTAKEN IN THE VILLAGE   
 BUT HAVE BEEN DISCREET AND HAVE BEEN  
 KEPT TO A MINIMUM.THE AGE OLD INDUSTRY
 OF FARMING STILL SURVIVES NOW AIDED BY
 MODERN TECHNOLOGY.THE MAJORITY OF     
 PEOPLE WHO NOW RESIDE IN THE VILLAGE  
 HAVE ONLY LIVED THERE FOR A FEW YEARS,
 SEEKING OUT THE PEACE THAT THE VILLAGE
 HAS TO OFFER. IN THE PAST FEW DECADES 
 MANY FAMILIES HAVE HAD TO LEAVE THE   
 VILLAGE SEEKING  MORE REMUNERATIVE    
 EMPLOYMENT CLOSER TO TOWN.THE VILLAGE 
 SCHOOL STANDS EMPTY AND HAS DONE FOR  
 SEVERAL YEARS.CHILDREN HAVE QUITE A   
 JOURNEY TO GO TO JUNIOR OR SECONDARY  
 SCHOOL.THERE ARE SOME CLUBS AND       
 LEISURE FACILITIES,A VILLAGE SHOP AND 
 THE PEOPLE ARE VERY FRIENDLY.A CAR IS 
 ESSENTIAL DUE TO POOR PUBLIC TRANSPORT</content>
