		<title>15A SCHOOLBOY'S DAY:B.BALESTER</title>
		<content>   After ten hours sleep my mum wakes  
 me up at 7.45am and I get out of bed  
 at 8am. I get dressed and go          
 downstairs to the first floor and go  
 into the bathroom. I look into the    
 mirror to see my hair sticking out all
 over as if I've had an electric       
 shock!I walk downstairs, passing my   
 brother running upstairs in a hurry. I
 get downstairs to see Wincey Willis   
 forecasting the weather on television.
 I walk into the kitchen sit down and  
 have my breakfast, which is cereal, or
 eggs.When I finish I take the dog for 
 a walk, and leave for school.         
   I reach school at 8.45am, and we    
 then have ten minutes playtime. We    
 have our Assembly in the morning and  
 after that we have register and       
 spellings or we have to do some       
 writing. We then have our morning     
 break and after that, we do maths.    </content>
