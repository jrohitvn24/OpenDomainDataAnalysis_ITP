		<title>01GENERAL OVERVIEW</title>
		<content>         This area falls into two clear
 parts. To the west are the villages of
 Kiveton Park and Wales while to the   
 east is South Anston. The two parts   
 are separated by a belt of land which 
 is made up of open agricultural land  
 to the north and a small industrial   
 complex of quarries and a steel works 
 to the south.                         
    The contrast between the two parts 
 is marked. South Anston is basically  
 an ancient village but many new houses
 have been built in recent years. It is
 now largely a dormitory village for   
 Sheffield, Rotherham and Worksop.     
    Kiveton Park, which includes       
 the village of Wales, also has ancient
 origins but is now basically a mining 
 village with much local authority and 
 NCB housing. Most people are employed 
 locally, either in the pit or steel   
 works.                                </content>
