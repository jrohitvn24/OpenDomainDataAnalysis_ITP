 Our first trip was to Hillside Close. 
                                       
 Hillside Close was built by William   
 Jeffery Collins. He built it for old  
 and retired people.                   
                                       
 There are bungalows, flats and a home 
 which is called Hillside House.       
                                       
 There is an open space, in the middle 
 of the Close, which is grassed.       
                                       
 There is a memorial seat to show that 
 William Jeffery Collins Built the     
 Close.                                
                                       
 There is a Warden's house where a     
 person lives who makes sure everyone  
 living there is all right.
