		<title>05FARMING IN TYTHERINGTON</title>
		<content> Farming around Tytherington is mainly{
{dairy.}Many of the farms have         
 originated from farms dating back to  
{1791.}The average size farm is about  
 120-150 acres.The soil is a mix       
 between{lown}soil, which everything   
 can be planted on, and a heavy{clay}  
 soil, which is suitable for wheat. The
 man we interviewed had 120 acres of   
 land. 20 acres of this is lowlying    
 land, which can get rather wet in the 
 winter months. This year he is going  
 to drain 10 acres of this. he has a   
 rather old milking parlour which is   
 not like the new{"Herring bone"}set   
 up. He can have 6 cows in the parlour 
 at once. But only milk 3 at once. He  
 has 120 milkers and 50 calves. Not all
 of these are milked at once, some are 
{"dry"}cows.
