		<title>06A day in the life of Lindsey</title>
		<content>On a school day Iget up at 7o'clock.I  
get dressed,then do my teeth.Igo down  
stairs to have my toast.Ihave melted   
butter and chocolate spread.We have    
just moved from Doncaster and I keep   
forgetting to put the plates out.My Dad
moved jobs.He used to work for Inter-  
national Harvesters.He now works at the
Blackwood Hodge Management Centre in   
Northampton.                           
When Mummy gets up,she gets dressed and
wakes me up.She gets breakfast         
ready.When Daddy gets up,he has a bath,
shaves,dresses,goes downstairs,and     
leaves.                                
When my sister(Katy)wakes up,I don't   
know what she does,because she is at a 
boarding school in York.               
My mummy isn't working at the moment.  
She used to work as a physio-therapist 
in Pontefract.                         
                                       </content>
