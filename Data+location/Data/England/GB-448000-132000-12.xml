		<content>{The Currys'training centre}at Easton  
 is a large, old house. Its purpose is 
 for the training of managers who work 
 for the company. The managers can be  
 either trainees or established        
 personel. They usually go to the      
 centre for up to a week and live there
 during this time. The centre has a    
 studio used for making TV adverts and 
 another area used for CCTV work. The  
 CCTV system is used to record how     
 managers perform during the training. 
 It can be played back to show good and
 bad points. Management training should
 be a continuous process hence the need
 for a training centre.{Condor}is an   
 engineering firm which has its        
 production plant and head offices in  
 Winchester. The company makes things  
 like petrol station canopies,         
 prefabricated buildings and sewage    
 plants.                               </content>
