		<title>09Fishing at Grafham Water.</title>
		<content>   Fishing is conducted annually, 1st  
 April to 29th October and is overseen 
 by a staff of five bailiffs and one   
 fisheries officer. Fishing is         
 prohibited close to the nature reserve
 and trolling is allowed only in a deep
 water area marked by buoys.           
   Before each season, the water is    
 stocked with rainbow and brown trout, 
 some  50,000 in 1985. Replenishment   
 continues throughout the season.      
   Coarse fish find their way,as spawn,
 into Grafham water. Because coarse    
 fishing is not permitted, the grown   
 fish are regularly netted and used to 
 restock Anglian rivers.               
   Anglers must obtain a rod licence   
 and a fishing permit and fish using   
 either rod and line with artificial   
 fly or with a feathered lure. Up to   
 eight fish per angler per day may be  
 caught.                               </content>
