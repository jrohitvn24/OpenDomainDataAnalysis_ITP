{The Alford Craft Market}started in    
{1974}with about five stalls. It       
 started because people wanted to      
 promote arts and craft. There are     
 about 35 stalls now. The craft market 
 is on at the end of April and then at 
 the end of June. There is a craft     
 market at the August bank holiday.    
 Then there is an indoor one at        
 Christmas. About{30,000}people go to  
 the craft market every year. This year
 there will be an art gallery at the   
{Alford Windmill.}The things that      
 people buy are all handmade. There are
 portraits, wooden carvings &amp; pots etc.
 The Alford Pottery is owned by{H &amp; M

 Craft Market and also exported        
 worldwide.
