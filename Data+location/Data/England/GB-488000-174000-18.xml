		<content> Last{Sunday}we all went to{Church}in  
 Maidenhead and then we stayed for     
 Pathfinders. After that we came home  
 to clean the house because{visitors}  
 were coming. We tidied our rooms and I
 played cricket until they arrived. We 
 had fun in the garden and the two dogs
 were let out to romp about with us. It
 was then time for lunch which was     
 chicken wrapped in bacon with spinach,
 carrots and peas. For a short while we
 watched the{television}and then we    
 went for a{walk}through the woods and 
 we took the dogs with us. Along the   
 path in the woods we came to a stream.
 We went on a little further then we   
 returned to our house. We decided to  
 watch the television again and then it
 was time for our visitors to go home. 
 After they had left we went outside   
 and did some{gardening. }
