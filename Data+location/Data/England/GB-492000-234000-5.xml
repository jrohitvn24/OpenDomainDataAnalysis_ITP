		<content> First thing in the morning my sister  
 Katie wakes me up because she wants a 
 drink.  I go downstairs and get one.  
 While I am downstairs I make our      
 breakfast.  We have Oat Crunchies.  We
 love them.  After breakfast I go up   
 stairs and get washed and dressed.    
 Then I comb my hair, put on my shoes  
 and coat then go to school.  When I   
 get there the children are usually in 
 the playground.  Then one of the      
 teachers claps her hands and we line  
 up to go in.  Our classrooms look     
 funny - they are like oblong caravans 
 with steps.  We do our work which Mrs 
 Whitfield set.  We go to the Hall at  
 10.30. Mrs James, the head teacher    
 reads us a story about God.  Then we  
 go out to play.  We do some more work 
 before lunch at 12.00. In the         
 afternoon we have a story .Then I go  
 home and play with my friends.(Fay)   </content>
