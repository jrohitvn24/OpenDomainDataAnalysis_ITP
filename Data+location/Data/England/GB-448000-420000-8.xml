		<title>08EMBLEMS JAZZ BAND</title>
		<content> The band which we have on our estate  
 is called the Knottingley Emblems     
 Juvenile Jazz Band.We get our name    
 from all the different badges or      
 emblems we wear on our uniforms.There 
 are 32 band members aged between 4 and
 18,with others waiting to join.We     
 practice once a week and enter        
 competitions twice a week in the band 
 season,which runs from June to August.
 Our instruments are kazoos,cymbals,   
 bass drum,side drums and bell-lyres,  
 but we also have majors,mascots,      
 banner holders and baton twirlers who 
 don't play instruments.In exhibitions 
 we first do a road march followed by a
 display of pattern marching in a      
 field.Later in the day we finish with 
 presentations to the best individuals 
 from each band,the best sections from 
 each band and the best band overall.
