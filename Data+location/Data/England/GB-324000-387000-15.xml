		<content> The church is highly decorated with   
 many bouquets of flowers.The church   
 has many fellowships like housegroups,
 pathfinders and Sunday  meet every    
 Sunday after church service.We do     
 little studying and we find out some  
 things and write on leaflets.On       
 certain Tuesdays it is clubnight.We   
 play games and listen to tapes.The    
 church is hoping to make enough money 
 to build an extension.The extension   
 will be used by the Sunday school     
 people.When the church service is on  
 some people who have children so t    
 hey either take them to Sunday school 
 or leave them in the Narthex with some
 people who voluntered to look after   
 them while the service is on.The      
 church has a very good choir.At Easter
 or any other special occasion they    
 sing on the steps infront of the Altar
 to the congregation.....              </content>
