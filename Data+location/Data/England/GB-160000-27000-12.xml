		<title>12TIN MINING (3)</title>
		<content> A new company reopened the works in   
 1852 and two large engines were used  
 to drain the mines, one of them being 
 the largest of its type in the world. 
 In 1857 the price of tin has slumped  
 to Â£40 a ton. The decline had begun,  
 by 1870 mining had ceased. Many of the
 men and their families had emigrated  
 to North America and Australia.       
                                       
      In 1907 an attempt was made to   
 reopen the mine but their new electric
 pumps could not cope with the volume  
 of water in the mine and the revival  
 attempt failed.                       
                                       
      The prosperity of the mine       
 greatly helped nearby settlements. In 
 Carleen a large chapel was built in   
 1833, a school was built for 140      
 children, doctors were available for  
 two pence a month.                    </content>
