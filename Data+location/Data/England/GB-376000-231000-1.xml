		<title>01Life  in Pendock today</title>
		<content> Pendock today is used mostly for farm 
 land, so most people who work here are
 farmers. Only a few people who live   
 and work in the area are not farmers. 
 The reason for people not working in  
 the area is because there are no jobs 
 available.Today more people are coming
 from other places to live in Pendock. 
 Near me I have two families one came  
 from Australia and the other came from
 London. Everybody in Pendock has a car
 because we only have the bus on       
 Mondays and Wednesdays. On the Monday 
 the bus goes to Ledbury and on a      
 Wednesday it goes to Gloucester.      
      In our area there are two schools
 Pendock School and Berrow Wood School.
 Since the M50 has been built it has   
 cut Pendock in half.
