		<title>09TRANSPORT IN DYMCHURCH</title>
		<content> The A259 is a narrow road with one    
 lane in each direction. It stretches  
 from Folkestone to Pevensey. The A259 
 runs parallel to the sea wall beside  
 Beach Estate. Just recently some      
 traffic lights have been put up for   
 the Pelican Crossing in Dymchurch     
 where a pavement runs on both sides of
 the road all the way through the      
 Village. The road is directly under   
 the level of the sea wall and in      
 places like Beach Estate the sea      
 splashes on it.                       
 These results came from a traffic     
 survey on July 5th 1985 from 9am to   
 3.30pm: 52% of traffic was going to   
 St. Mary's Bay, 48% towards Hythe.    
 3% foreign cars, 72% British cars, 1% 
 pedestrians, 12% were lorries and     
 vans, 1% were motorbikes, 3% were     
 bikes, 1% buses, 1% army vehicles.
