		<title>03The Fremington Landscape.</title>
		<content> The area around us stretches from     
 Penhill to Heanton Court and to       
 Yelland power station and includes    
 Chivenor airfield. In Fremington there
 is a quay on the estuary and a school.
 In Yelland there is a power station   
 and a holiday camp called 'Lagoon' but
 there is no school. The land is very  
 flat. The water down near the quay is 
 polluted and you cannot drtink it or  
 swim in it. In Fremington there is an 
 old manor house which is now converted
 to an old peoples home and nearby ther
 is an army camp. There is a football  
 club that play every week at the park 
 and there are shops, apost office, a  
 supermarket and a garage.  There are  
 two areas of woodland.
