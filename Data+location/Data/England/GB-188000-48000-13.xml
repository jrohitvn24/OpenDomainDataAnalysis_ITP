		<content>   We have two classrooms, an Infants  
 and a Junior. There are 45 full time  
 pupils and 7 part time. In the Winter 
 we have a Film Club. We choose films  
 to show at Film Club in the Infants   
 classroom at night. We also have a    
 Bird Club which meets once a month    
 like the Film Club. We pay 50p to be a
 member. Sometimes we go on a bird walk
 it's good fun but it's a bit muddy.   
 Football and Sports are in the playing
 field. In the playground we have a    
 netball pitch and a hopscotch. At the 
 top of the playground we have some    
 apparatus. Further up we've a         
 garden.Our teachers are Miss Greet,Mrs
 Richards and Mrs Smith.Every Christmas
 we do a play which we enjoy. Also we  
 do Maths,English,Reading and Tables.  
 The best things are trips. I have been
 to Padstow,Plymouth,Bath and London.  
 Every year we have a Fete.            </content>
