		<title>16CHANGES IN THE AREA</title>
		<content> The Walker family moved to Newton Hall
 in 1965.They have seen many changes.  
 Here is their account -               
 "In 1965 Newton Hall was mainly       
 farmland.Only a small number of shops 
 existed and the Bluecoat Primary      
 School was in the process of being    
 built.The area contained few roads and
 a very limited amount of housing.Since
 that time the estate has mushroomed   
 and is now one of the largest in      
 Europe.The farmland is covered with   
 houses and there is an extensive road 
 system.A Church,Community Centre,Two  
 Public Houses,Two Infants Schools,Two 
 Junior Schools and Two Shopping Areas 
 have all been built."                 
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
