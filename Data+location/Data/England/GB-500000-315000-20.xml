		<content> Most children begin their education at
 Little Bytham Primary School (in the  
 next block). There is no state nursery
 education in Lincolnshire closer than 
 Grantham. Many children attend a play-
 group in nearby Castle Bytham. Some go
 to private nursery classes and schools
 elsewhere.                            
  Little Bytham School has 2 teachers. 
 The 34 children come from L.Bytham,   
 Creeton, Counthorpe and Careby. Careby
 children travel by taxi. A few go to  
 independent schools in Witham on the  
 Hill, Baston or Stamford.             
  All children sit a selection exam at 
 11. If selected they go to single-sex 
 endowed schools in Stamford (fees paid
 by the LEA). If not they go to one of 
 Stamford's 2 secondary moderns (a few 
 cross the border to a comprehensive in
 Leicestershire). This system is due to
 change in 1987.                       </content>
