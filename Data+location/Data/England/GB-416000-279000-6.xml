  My Mum and Dad were born in India but
 my father left to join the British    
 Army in Cyprus as he could not find   
 work. He is now employed at the Rover 
 works in Solihull. We belong to the   
 Bengali Association and meet with     
 other Hindu's as there are very few   
 where we live.                        
  In our religion the cow is sacred to 
 us so we do not eat red meat. The     
 Ganges in India is our sacred river.  
  In October every year we have our    
 most important festival called Puja.  
 It lasts for 3 days and celebrates a  
 God called Duga. Duga was powerful    
 with ten arms each with a weapon, who 
 fought and killed a devil who had     
 immense powers that no other God could
 match.
