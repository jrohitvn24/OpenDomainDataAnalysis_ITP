		<content> Away from the main roads one travels  
 along minor roads only one car wide,  
 and with their bends and high ditches 
 often topped by hedges the view can be
 very restricted. Steep gradients,     
 narrow bridges and rough surfaces also
 combine to make driving difficult.    
 Most roads are lined with a bank of   
 soil (the Devon Banks) and sometimes  
 trees form an arch over the road.     
 These banks may reach a height of a   
 metre or more above the road and give 
 you the feeling of walking in a large 
 flower filled ditch.                  
                                       
 Many of the hedges are now cut by     
 tractors leaving an unattractive box  
 like appearance, the old craft of     
 laying a hedge being too time         
 consuming for the modern farmer.
