 At 6.55 a.m.this morning I woke up and
 got dressed.Then I went down stairs   
 and took the dog for a walk.Afterwards
 I had my breakfast.Then I went outside
 to play until 8.15 a.m.After that I   
 set off for school.The school which   
 I go to is Christ Church School.      
 When I got to school I played football
 with my friends.At nine o'clock we    
 went in for Assembly where we sang a  
 song and said prayers.After that we   
 did maths until break.Then we came in 
 and did English.After lunch we read   
 stories.Then we played rounders.At    
 five past three we went home.I played 
 with my dogs after doing my homework. 
 Then I watched television before I    
 went to bed.
