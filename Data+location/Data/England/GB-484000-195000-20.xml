		<content>    The gentle slopes of the chalk     
hills with their wooded areas make this
a delightful place to live.In Spring   
the beech trees,clad in soft delicate  
green,with shafts of sunlight catching 
the bluebells make the woods an        
inspiring place to walk.In Autumn the  
many hues of the leaves are an equally 
commanding sight which can herald a    
winter of icy and snowy "excitement"   
for car owners who use the hills and   
children who sledge on the Common.     
    Wildlife is here in plenty for     
those who are observant.There are deer,
badgers,foxes,rabbits,squirrels and    
many smaller mammals and for the       
ornithologist kestrels,sparrow hawks,  
owls and jays as well as the common    
woodland and garden birds.             
    The information for this "D" block 
has been collected by Class 2,Downley  
Middle School under Mrs.Jo.Patience.   </content>
