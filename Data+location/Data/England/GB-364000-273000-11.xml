		<content> Saturday - My brother woke me at seven
 to play marbles. We played seven games
 then we went down stairs to watch     
 Wide Awake Club on television. After a
 breakfast of branflakes, I went out to
 use my BMX and played soccer. After   
 lunch of a bacon sandwich, I watched  
 the Cup Final, then my friends and    
 I played ball tig and made some dens. 
 I was so tired, I had salad for tea   
 and went to bed.                      
 Sunday - I played football with Ian   
 before my breakfast of shreddies.     
 I was half asleep and spilt my milk   
 everywhere. We played on a ramp on the
 field and kicked balls at each        
 other until lunch, which was cinnamon 
 toast. I met Miles. We went back to   
 the field. Halfway through our game of
 football, Miles was pulled off his    
 bike by a bully but we escaped. It was
 8 p.m. so I went to bed.              </content>
