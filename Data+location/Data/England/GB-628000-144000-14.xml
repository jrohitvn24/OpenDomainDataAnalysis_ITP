		<title>14Pineham Bottom Farm</title>
		<content>The farm covers 150 acres mostly       
devoted to animal and poultry. The     
arable farming consists of barley and  
oats grown partly to sell and feed.    
The main activity is pig farming. There
are about 150 pigs reared to a weight  
of 250lbs. This takes 12-18 months.    
They are then sold to Bowyers in       
Wiltshire where they are made into pork
pies and sausages. The poultry consists
of hens, bantoms and geese and are     
reared for eggs and as pets. One field 
is used to graze 2 donkeys and a       
shetland pony. Another contains poultry
and 12 goats. Four sheep are kept and  
one yielded a fleece of wool 16lbs in  
weight. The main flock of about 700    
sheep is grazed on land over a 15 mile 
radius. A herd of bullocks is sent to  
Ashley, 3 miles away for summer        
grazing. This farm does not use        
intensive "factory farming" methods.   </content>
