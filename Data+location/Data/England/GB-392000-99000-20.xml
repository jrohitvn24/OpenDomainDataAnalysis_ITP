		<content> IN THE BLOCK AS A WHOLE THERE DO NOT  
 SEEM TO BE MANY NEW BUILDINGS.MOST OF 
 THE FARMHOUSES AND COTTAGES LOOK AS IF
 THEY HAVE BEEN THERE FOR MANY YEARS.IN
 STURMINSTER MARSHALL HOWEVER,THERE ARE
 MANY NEW HOUSES AND OTHERS ARE BEING  
 BUILT.A FEW YEARS AGO A DEVELOPMENT   
 PLAN WAS DRAWN UP FOR THE VILLAGE AND 
 IT SAID THAT NEW HOUSES SHOULD BE     
 LIMITED TO TEN A YEAR FOR THE NEXT TEN
 YEARS.HOWEVER,NOW THAT WE HAVE MAINS  
 SEWAGE AND MAINS WATER IT SEEMS THAT  
 WE ARE LIKELY TO HAVE MORE THAN A     
 HUNDRED HOUSES IN TEN YEARS.THE LATEST
 DEVELOPMENT IS AT SHERIDAN WAY.A      
 FAMILY HAS ALREADY MOVED INTO ONE OF  
 THE HOUSES AND THE OTHERS ARE STILL   
 BEING BUILT.PHOTOGRAPH "D" WAS TAKEN  
 ON THIS SITE.VILLAGES NEARBY HAVE     
 GROWN QUICKLY INTO TOWNS,PERHAPS THIS 
 WILL HAPPEN HERE.
