		<content>  The sand dunes between Hartley and   
 St Marys is a good place to have a    
 picnic but on 12th 1864 such an event 
 ended in tragedy for a party of Seaton
 Delaval people. They were accosted by 
 a miner named Bell who demanded money 
 from William Moore. Bell drew a gun   
 and shot Moore in the thigh, he died  
 several hours later. Bell was taken   
 away and sentenced to six years       
 imprisonment.                         
  In the autumn of 1739 a gibbet could 
 be seen on Curry's point holding a    
 body. Hanging there was Michael Curry,
 recently executed for the murder of   
 Robert Sheuil a Hartley landlord. It  
 was thought that Curry had been       
 incited by the mans wife but while    
 confessing his guilt he denied this   
 claim. From that time on the spot     
 where the gibbet stood has been known 
 as Curry's point                      </content>
