		<content> Our school is over one hundred years  
 old.It is a very small school.The one 
 large room measures 13m39cm by 4m88cm.
 We have two classes,11 juniors and 10 
 infants.The bell still exists but we  
 do not use it.Our school dinners come 
 from St.Wilfrid's in Ripon.We attend  
 school from the age of four till      
 eleven, then we transfer to           
 secondary school-Ripon City or Ripon  
 Grammar or Upper Nidderdale or        
 St.Aidan's in Harrogate.We have a     
 playground, about the size of a tennis
 court and a school garden.There is a  
 Headteacher who teaches the juniors,an
 assistant who teaches the infants and 
 a part-time teacher who teaches music.
 There is a dinner lady(who is also the
 clerical assistant),a cleaner and a   
 non-teaching assistant(who also looks 
 after us at playtimes).
