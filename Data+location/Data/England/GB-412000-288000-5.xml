		<title>05...SOCIAL CONCERNS</title>
		<content>Several issues come under this heading.
There are many retired and old people  
who need day centre care, home helps   
etc. to cater for their social and     
physical needs. Services which are     
dealing with these are very stretched. 
The area has many unemployed with      
little to do. When Y.O.P. schemes end  
many people are unemployed again.      
There are few facilities for the young 
apart from youth clubs and church run  
clubs. Children hang around buildings. 
A large part of the population consists
of young single parents needing help   
from social services and provision for 
their children. More day care is needed
for these children despite the play-   
groups, mother and toddler groups and  
nurseries which are available.         
Poor housing exists particularly in the
flats in the area. Vandalism also gives
cause for concern in the locality.     </content>
