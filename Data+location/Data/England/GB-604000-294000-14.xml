  Nanny and Grandad brought some       
presents too.We had a real Christmas   
Tree with Christmas lights and         
chocolate things and Christmas crackers
on it.I got a thimble and a hat(paper) 
out of my cracker,and a funny joke.    
  For breakfast we had egg,sausage and 
fried bread and tomatoes and fried     
potatoes which mummy cooked.           
  When Nanny and Grandad came we opened
their presents.They brought me a racing
car with a trailer and the racing car  
goon the trailer.We bought Grandad a   
tie I've forgotten what we bought      
Granny.                                
  We had roast turkey for lunch with   
vegetables and Christmas pudding with  
custard for lunch.Nanny and Grandad    
stayed the night and went home on      
Boxing Day after lunch.
