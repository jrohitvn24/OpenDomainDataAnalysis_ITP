		<title>01DESCRIPTION:DANE END &amp; AREA</title>
		<content> The area consists of two villages,    
{DANE END and SACOMBE}and the three    
 hamlets of{SACOMBE GREEN, ROWNEY      
{PRIORY and POTTERS GREEN.  }          
 The area, in{North East Hertfordshire 
 is quiet and peaceful. It is good     
 farming country, mainly arable. The   
 highest point in the D-block is 125m  
 above sea level.                      
 There are two churches, All Saints at 
 Little Munden, near Dane End and St.  
 Catherine's at Sacombe.               
 There is a combined general store and 
 Post Office, a garage which used to be
 the blacksmiths and one public house  
 called "The Boot". These are all in   
 Dane End. One primary school serves   
 the area. This is Little Munden JMI   
 School which is situated next to All  
 Saints Church.                        
 Roads often become impassable because 
 of drifting snow and flood water.     </content>
