		<title>11Interview _Local Doctor</title>
		<content>{Q. What do you think are the main     
{differences between the modern role of
{a doctor in The N.H.S. and that of the
{old family practitioner?}             
 A. The biggest difference is we are   
 now one of a team, whereas there used 
 to be one doctor on his own. Now we   
 work together with nurses, midwives,  
 health visitors and social services,  
 all organized from the same building, 
 the Health Centre.                    
{Q. Is a doctors job harder due to the 
{fact that he does'nt know individual  
{patients personally.}                 
 A. It would be if that were true, but 
 I would dispute it. There are five    
 doctors working together at this      
 health centre and we have about 11,000
 patients. Obviously we can't get to   
 know every single one of them, but    
 most of these are healthy and we only 
 see about 5% to 10% of that number.   </content>
