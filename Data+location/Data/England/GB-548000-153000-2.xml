		<title>02 A day in my life.</title>
		<content>My name is Chris Wade. I am 10 years   
and 4 months old. On a weekday I wake  
up at about 07.00. I read to about     
07.30 or go downstairs and play on the 
computer. At about 07.35 I have my     
breakfast and go upstairs and get      
dressed. I unload the dishwasher for my
mum. Then I go upstairs and get my     
things ready for school. I then clean  
my teeth and say goodbye to mum and go 
to school. I arrive at school at 08.50 
and play with my friends until 09.00   
when school starts. We then have       
lessons until 10.30 when we have       
playtime until 10.50. We have more     
lessons until 12.00 (lunchtime) and    
after lunch we have playtime until     
13.15. Lessons go on until 15.15       
(hometime).When I get home I call for  
my next door neighbour or watch T.V.   
Tea is at 17.45 and I go to bed at     
20.00 and read until 20.30.            </content>
