		<content> Most of the houses in the Roundhay    
 area are Victorian or Edwardian       
 detached and semi-detached houses.    
 They are large family houses          
 constructed in brick and stone, with  
 slate roofs.  Many have attics,       
 cellars, and bay windows decorated    
 with stained glass. The area of       
 Roundhay Park has a few large villas  
 around the perimeter interspersed with
 large detached houses, some recently  
 built, and some over 100 years old.   
 One Victorian dwelling overlooking the
 park and known as Parc Mount, has been
 converted to a hotel. Behind this is a
 large block of luxury penthouses. Also
 adjoining are single storey stone alm 
 houses, built by the Nicholson family 
 who previously owned Roundhay Park    
 for their aged retired servants. To   
 the North is an old farm and buildings
 known as The Grange,now a pig farm.   </content>
