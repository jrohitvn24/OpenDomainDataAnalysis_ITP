		<content>  My house was built in 1971,so it is  
 14 years old.It's quite a big house.It
 has six rooms,two downstairs and four 
 upstairs.We have a kitchen,a living   
 room,a bathroom,three bedrooms and a  
 hall.It is a semidetached house.We    
 have a big garden with a lot of plants
 and flowers in it.We do not have a    
 garage but we have a shed.We have gas 
 central heating.I have lived here for 
 eleven years.My mum and dad have lived
 here for 14 years.                    
 2 In my family there are four people: 
 my mam,my dad,my sister and I.My      
 sister is Morag,or Moogie or Boo for  
 short.I always fight with her if she  
 comes in my bedroom.My mam works as a 
 midwife at the City Maternity Hospital
 She works on nights,so she has to     
 sleep through the day.My dad works at 
 the family practitioner committee.
