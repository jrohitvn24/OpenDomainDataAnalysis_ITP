		<title>19A DAY IN THE LIFE OF SOPHIE</title>
		<content> "I get up at 7o'clock,turn on my      
 bedside light and read for a bit.Then 
 I get dressed and mum does my hair.I  
 go downstairs and have Frosties for   
 breakfast.We walk to school or go by  
 car if we're late.Outside we wait till
 the bell rings then go in and take out
 our workshop cards. After maths we    
 have playtime at 10.30.We go outside  
 to play on the field or yard. Some of 
 us eat fruit or nuts. On Tuesdays     
 we see Look and Read on television.   
  At lunch time we wash our hands and  
 walk to the canteen for school meals  
 or packed lunches with milk or water  
 to drink.The oldest on the table wipes
 it down.Afterwards I play with all my 
 friends it is the longest play time.  
  In the afternoon we do all kinds of  
 things.I like sewing best.We take our 
 chairs and sometimes our knitting to  
 the story corner.We go home at 3.15." </content>
