		<content>{Blenheim Orchard,}at the north edge of
 the village, is comprised of{bungalows
 and{semi-detached houses,}built on an 
 orchard of Church Farm. To the south  
 is the{Lambert Estate of bungalows,   
 built on land originally part of Pool 
 Farm. On both estates building started
 in{1957.}Ribbon type development has  
 occurred along Leckhampton Lane to the
 north-east at intervals since 1935.   
 A group of local workers from the     
 nearby Dowty factory formed a         
{co-operative}between 1955 and 1960 to 
{build their own bungalows.}They pooled
 resources and skills and built the    
 bungalows in their free time.         
 The many recent conversions and       
 extensions to existing properties     
 indicate satisfaction with the        
 amenities of the area and a reluctance
 to move out of the village.
