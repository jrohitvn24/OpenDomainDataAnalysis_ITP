		<content> Flint artefacts dating from ancient   
 times have long been prized by        
 observant historians in the Cotswolds.
 These include flint tools, scrapers,  
 borers and arrowheads, although hand  
 axes are rare. Many finds are in the  
 Ashmolean Museum Oxford and the Museum
 at Cheltenham. Local people also have 
 good collections.                     
 Round and long barrows abound in this 
 area. A field known as Cow Common on  
 Swell Wold Farm has one long barrow   
 and approx. 8 round tumuli, found to  
 contain 10 adult burials, one infant, 
 spoons and pottery. There is a round  
 barrow at Huntsmans Quarry.           
 Modern agricultural methods destroy   
 some sites e.g. long barrow Slaughter 
 Way field beside Condicote Lane.      
 The Bristol &amp; Gloucestershire         
 Archeological Soc. keep information on
 the above, including aerial photos.   </content>
