		<title>11School Dinners</title>
		<content>    At twelve O'Clock we go out to     
 play.                                 
 At about ten past twelve the dinner   
 lady blows a whistle and shouts       
 "Dinner eaters" which means children  
 who have hot dinners.So I go in and   
 wash my hands.After we have washed and
 dried our hands we line up.Then the   
 dinner lady counts us to make sure we 
 are all there.We walk into the canteen
 ,where I sit down next to James Sharp.
 The most popular meal is fish in      
 batter,with chips and peas.The        
 favourite sweet is cheese and biscuits
 .My favourite meal is roast pork,     
 cabbage,roast potatoes and gravy.     
   My favourite sweet is chocolate     
 sponge with custard on top.When we    
 have finished we ask the dinner lady  
 if we can go out to play.
