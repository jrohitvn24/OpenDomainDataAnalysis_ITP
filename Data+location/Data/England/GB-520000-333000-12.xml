		<title>12ST. MARGARET'S CHURCH</title>
		<content>  St. Margaret's Church is situated    
 next to the primary school in         
 Quadring. These two are by what is    
 thought to be the original main       
 road which is one kilometre away from 
 the main body of the village.         
    The building is light and airy.    
 A very good view of the surrounding   
 area can be had from the church tower.
    There is an account in ancient     
 Lincoln Diocesan Records of the       
 Induction of a Vicar to Quadring in   
 1250. Earlier still,Walter De Rochford
 in 1200 was compelled to pay tribute  
 to the Abbess of Stainfield from the  
 revenue of Quadring Church. Mention is
 made in the original Domesday Book    
 that a large part of Quadring belonged
 to the Bishop of Lincoln,and His      
 Lordship would be under an obligation 
 to provide for the spiritual needs of 
 the people. i.e. a church.            </content>
