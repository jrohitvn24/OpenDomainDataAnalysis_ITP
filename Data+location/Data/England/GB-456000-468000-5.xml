		<title>05Ivy Farm</title>
		<content> The farmhouse dates from 1607 and is  
 built in traditioanl form of Long     
 House. This means that the room lead  
 from one into another to form a line. 
 It was built using ships timbers as   
 the frame, and small bricks with some 
 stone at the base of the walls. The   
 front of the house is timbered from   
 about two metes from the ground up to 
 the eaves. The back of the house is   
 not timbered but the roof slopes down 
 to a height of 1 metre from  ground.  
 The house was origially thatched,and  
 this was replaced with tile roof in   
 about 1900. It must be assumed that   
 when first it was built there would be
 no upper storey. Not one of the four  
 bedrooms has a vertical outer wall and
 their windows are all dormer.There are
 vertical timbers exposed on interior  
 walls. One of the interior walls was  
 constructed of wattle and daub.       </content>
