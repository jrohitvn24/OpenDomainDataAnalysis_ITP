		<title>18A School Fete at Boughton</title>
		<content>   On Saturday 29th June,1985,it was   
 Boughton School Fete.People worked    
 hard in the morning to get things     
 ready.My mum helped on the Toy Stall. 
 Lots of people came.There was lots of 
 shouting,laughing,music,bells ringing,
 money clicking and people talking.    
 There were majorettes and gymnastic   
 displays.All sorts os things go on.   
 Games to play,thing to buy and rides  
 to go on.It was a lovely sunny day,   
 clear and bright(that's very unusual  
 for a fete).There was a play area,    
 teas,drinks,and ice-creams to buy. I  
 enjoyed it thoroughly.This year for   
 the first time we started the fete    
 with a three mile Fun Run around the  
 village.Afterwards I helped my mum to 
 pack up.Then I went home happy and    
 tired.We made nearly Â£600 which will  
 go towards buying things the school   
 needs,including a computer disc drive.</content>
