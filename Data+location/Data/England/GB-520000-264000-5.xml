		<content> This area,being rural, does not offer 
 many organised leisure activities and 
 many people travel outside the area to
 take part in sporting and leisure     
 pastimes.Many people use the golf and 
 squash facilities in near by St,Neots 
 and there is one squash court in Great
 Paxton itself.The river encourages    
 fishing while many spend their free   
 time gardening and doing maintenance  
 and improvement jobs in their homes.  
 There is a National Housewives        
 Register group which meets fortnightly
 to discuss varied issues and to hear  
 talks by visiting speakers.Some adults
 belong to the Round Table and Ladies  
 Circle-groups which do charitable     
 work.There are village football teams 
 and a soft ball team. The local public
 houses are well used, as are the
