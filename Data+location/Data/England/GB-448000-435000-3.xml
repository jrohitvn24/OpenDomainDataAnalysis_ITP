		<content> Fifty children at Church Fenton       
 Primary school were interviewed to    
 discover their thoughts about school  
 and the village.We found out:         
 1.50% of children walk to school,20%  
 go by bus,20% by car 10% by bike.     
 2.95% travel to school in less than 15
 mins.                                 
 3.Popular hobbies include watching    
 T.V.,computer games walking and       
 playing in the park.                  
 4.Most liked living in C.F. as it is a
 friendly  place.                      
 5.Most said they wanted more shops    
 especially toy and clothes shops.     
 6.Dislikes include lack of facilities 
 and shops.(Adults said same). Worst of
 all the noise from the RAF planes.    
 7.Most would probably leave village   
 due to noise,lack of facilities and to
 find a job.
