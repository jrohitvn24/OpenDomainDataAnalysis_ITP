		<content> THORN FARM                            
 Thorn Farm is situated in the hamlet  
 of Butt's Green, 5 kilometres         
 south-east of Chelmsford.             
 The farm is 500 years old.  It is a   
{fruit farm growing apples and pears.} 
 Some of the fruit is taken by         
 articulated lorry to be sold in       
 Doncaster in the north of England.    
 Some of the fruit is stored locally   
 before selling to London.             
                                       
 An interesting feature to be seen at  
 Thorn Farm House is a mullioned window
 which was plastered up during the     
 period of{window tax.}In 1696 houses  
 were taxed according to the number of 
 windows. The tax was increased on 6   
 occasions in the late 18th century and
 was not repealed until 1851. To avoid 
 paying too much tax many people had   
 some of their windows blocked up.     </content>
