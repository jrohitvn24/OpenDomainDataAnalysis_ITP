		<content> for school but situated next door,many
 a morning I'm knitting her plaits into
 shape as the school bell dongs its    
 constant reminder of our lateness.    
 Behind the closed door Kit and I      
 survey the wreckage then I hear"Where 
 are we going today mummy?Who's coming 
 here today?"making me feel incredibly 
 guilty if there's nothing in the      
 offing.However it's my turn to provide
 lunch for a group of friends though   
 that's not soon enough for Kit so he  
 goes to play with Richard.By the time 
 we have lunched and the children have 
 managed to grind the last crisp into  
 the carpet it's almost 3.30 and time  
 for Jolan to return from school.Much  
 to Kit's delight it's not a day for   
 piano lessons,Brownies or Gymnastics. 
 When the novelty of having his sister 
 around wears off they're squabbling   
 over who has the black fruit gum!     </content>
