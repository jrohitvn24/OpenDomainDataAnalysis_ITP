		<title>12Festival Report, Prickwillow</title>
		<content> When I went to Prickwillow on Sunday  
 23 June 1985 I went to the{Pumping    
{Engine Museum.}The pumps pumps 140    
{tons}of water a minute. The engine is 
 so large that only half of it is in   
 the museum. I went to see the vintage 
 car display near the pumping museum.  
 Later I went on the tractor ride past 
 Mr Rice's Peat farm then we saw the   
 rabbits.

 racs at Prickwillow Festival so did

 people clay pidgeon shooting at the

 the vintage car display, one of them  
 was a model T Ford.
