		<title>04A Minister in Jersey</title>
		<content>      Reverend Farley of Sion Methodist
 Church has been in Jersey nearly three
 years. He says it is different from   
 his old home in Derbyshire in the     
 Pennines. He told  us that his busiest
 day is Sunday. The size of the        
 congregation varies every week.       
 Reverend Farley said the average size 
 of his congregation is about 65 - 80  
 people that is including 30 children. 
 Certain services have more people such
 as, harvest, anniversary, carols and  
 family. He told us that  he spends his
 weekdays visiting the sick in hospital
 and homes. In the evening he does his 
 paperwork and attends meetings. He did
 not have any other jobs before        
 entering the church but he did a      
 little farming. His father is also a  
 Methodist minister.
