 There were 3 family doctors who held  
 surgeries in their homes every        
 weekday. The cottage hospital had a   
 resident matron and nurses.There was a
 casualty department and the doctors   
 also performed quite serious          
 operations.                           
 HOUSING Most people lived in small    
 cottages with no bathroom and the     
 toilet was usually outside. There were
 no houses in Longdogs Lane, Winters   
 Lane, Slade Road, Chineway, Higher    
 Ridgeway or Butts Road.The roads were 
 not tarred and therefore very         
 dusty. The water cart pulled by the   
 council horses sprayed the roads      
 to keep the dust down. Pavements were 
 mostly cobbled.
