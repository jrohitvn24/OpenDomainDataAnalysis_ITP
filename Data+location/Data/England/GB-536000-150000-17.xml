		<title>17A Typical Family In Oxted</title>
		<content>   My family is a typical one living in
{S.E. England in 1985.}Like many famil-
 ies in Oxted we have  come  here  from
 elsewhere, in our case from Wales.  We
 have{4}in our family  which  is  about
 average. My parents both work.  Mum is
 a teacher locally,  &amp; Dad works in the
 head_office of a bank in London.  Like
 most Dads  he travels out of Oxted  to
 work.     In Oxted there are plenty of
{leisure  opportunities. }Most families
 join in local sports and leisures.  My
 house is not far from  these  facilit-
 ies. We live just opposite the {Middle
{School} where my brother and  I  go to
 learn. There is is also a First School
 for young children.   Most families in
 Oxted have  a refrigerator ,  washing-
 machine , cooker , 1 or 2 cars ,  &amp;  a
 television set. Many families now have
 computers, videos, stereos,  &amp;  micro-
 wave ovens. {By Elin Davies, aged 11. </content>
