		<title>11THE DEPUTY RANGER</title>
		<content> Mr Wiseman is Deputy Head Ranger of   
 Windsor Great Park. A qualified       
 chartered surveyor, he employs 300    
 people to work on the Queen's 15000   
 acre estate, consisting of forest,    
 park, gardens and farmland. He feels a
 personal responsibility towards all   
 his tenants and employees. Mornings   
 are often spent in the office, where  
 accounts are kept on computer,        
 answering letters, otherwise he is    
 outside, seeing that all is well. His 
 aim is to keep the park fit for the   
 Royal Family to enjoy when they are at
 Windsor Castle. Much can be used by   
 the general public tool He discusses  
 new ideas with Prince Philip, the Head
 Ranger and each year he visits the    
 Royal Show. He is so busy that he     
 sometimes cannot manage to take his   
 annual six weeks of holiday.
