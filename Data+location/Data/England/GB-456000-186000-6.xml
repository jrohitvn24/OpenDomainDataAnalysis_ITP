		<content>{Fish and chips} is a favourite savoury
meal. The fish is dipped in a batter of
flour and water then fried in hot deep 
fat until it is crisp. The chips are   
potatoes which are peeled and cut into 
fingers then fried in hot deep fat     
until golden. {Fish fingers} are small 
finger shaped portions of cod covered  
with bread crumbs then fried. {Bacon   
and egg} is a tasty breakfast meal made
by cracking an egg into a frying pan   
with a little fat. Cook until the white
sets and fry the slices of bacon in the
same pan. {Mince} is meat cut by a     
machine into long thin strings which   
break into crumbs. It can then be      
cooked and served in various ways. A   
microwave oven is popular as it can be 
used to cook, or re-heat food, very    
quickly. {Ice cream} is a popular      
dessert.
