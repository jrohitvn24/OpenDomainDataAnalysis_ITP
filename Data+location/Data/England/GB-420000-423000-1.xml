		<title>01HECKMONDWIKE AND DISTRICT 1.</title>
		<content> The  industrial towns of  Heckmondwike
 and  Batley  along  with the  adjacent
 suburban    villages   of   Livesedge,
 Gomersal,   Birstall   Smithies    and
 Staincliffe  lie in the  heart of  the
 W.Yorkshire  connurbation.  Industrial
 development  comprises the remnants of
 a woolen  textile  industry.  The area
 specialised  in 'shoddy', that  is the
 reclaiming  of  wool  fibres  from old
 clothes, rags and waste to clean, spin
 and weave. Industrial decline has left
 many  valley  floor  mills  demolished
 empty or  used for other business. The
 mill  chimney  is a rare  sight in the
 1980's. Most industrial development is
 also in the valley  bottoms along Spen
 and  Batley  Becks.  Metalworking  and
 mechanical   engineering  had  origins
 in the woollen industry but industrial
 structure  has  diversified  including
 paint,chemicals and sportswear firms. </content>
