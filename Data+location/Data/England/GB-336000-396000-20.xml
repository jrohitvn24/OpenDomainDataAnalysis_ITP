		<title>20GAMES WE PLAY</title>
		<content> Some of the games played by           
 children in our area are Hide and     
 Seek, Tick, Stuck in the Mud, British 
 Bulldog, and Three Bad Eggs. Some need
 equipment like bats and balls, but    
 most just need players.               
{Hide and Seek}is still the most       
 popular. One player, chosen to be     
 'man' counts, while the other players 
 hide. The player who is 'man' then    
 tries to find the others. When a      
 hiding player is found, both race back
 to base. If 'man' gets back first, he 
 shouts "one,two,three    " and the    
 player's name. If the player gets     
 there first, he/she shouts "one,two,  
 three,got my own dead". The first     
 player caught is 'man' next time. The 
 last player can shout "blue bottle"   
 and then 'man' must be 'man' again.
