		<title>03DISABLED PEOPLE IN ENHAM</title>
		<content> Since 1918 there have been disabled   
 people in Enham Alamein.The hostel    
 where they live was built for people  
 injured in the World Wars, it is now  
 used as a place of work and lodgings  
 for disabled people all with different
 disablities.We went to see Mrs.Ballard
 who has had Polio since she was 18    
 months.She now lives with her husband 
 in a newly built bungalow,her husband 
 is disabled too.She finds she can cope
 but with things to help her{HOME LIFE 
 Her husband works in the Industries   
 which produces {ARTS AND CRAFTS}and   
 other things. The disabled people's   
{ HEALTH}is taken care of by the local 
 surgery. Their {HOUSING} is most      
 adequate, but changes have been made, 
 for example Mrs.Ballard's plug sockets
 have been moved to a position that is 
 easier to reach as she is in a        
 wheelchair.They keep a dog for company</content>
