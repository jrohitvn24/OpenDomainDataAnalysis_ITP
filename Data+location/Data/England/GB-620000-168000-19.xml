		<title>19Ecology-The Beach cont'd</title>
		<content>Moving creatures mostly consisted of   
crabs,including most often the common  
shore crab.                            
    The lower section was the most     
interesting because here we found many 
little rock pools amongst the          
mud.Especially interesting were the    
starfish of which we counted at least  
twenty and quite a number of brown     
shrimps.It is particularly difficult to
move around this lower section of the  
beach because of the thick mud but if  
yo quick enough it is possible to find 
a number of different types of crab.We 
also dug in the mud to find lug worms  
they are a popular form of bait for    
the local fishermen.
