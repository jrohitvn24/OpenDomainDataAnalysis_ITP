		<content>{Skipping.}If you want to play skipping
 2 people have to hold the rope and    
 turn it while one person jumps.If that
 person gets tangled then they are out 
 so they have to hold the end and      
 someone else jumps.There is a song    
 that you can skip to:"I am in the     
 kitchen,Doing a bit of stitching,In   
 came the bogeyman,Then I ran out." At 
 the end of the song you run out of the
 skipping.                             
{Elastics.}What you do is you choose 2 
 people to be enders.Then there might  
 be 2 people jumping toether.That is   
 doubles partners.Sometimes you jump on
 your own.You have to jump on the      
 elastic and then jump inbetween.Next  
 you take one strand over,stand on the 
 other,then jump,releasing the first   
 strand.I like it very much.
