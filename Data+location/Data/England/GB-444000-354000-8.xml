		<content>  At 3.30 pm. we go home from school.We
 go in the house,get changed and go and
 call for our friends.We see if they   
 are coming out and if they aren't in  
 then we go back home and watch        
 cartoons on the television for a      
 while. Usually after a hard day of    
 work at school we get something to    
 eat or drink and relax and watch T.V. 
 a little longer. Later we call for our
 friends again. Mostly they are in by  
 now and so we go and play at cricket  
 or go for a bike ride. When we arrive 
 back home we play games on our        
 computers.There are many computer     
 games to play. These include:         
 Ghostbusters,Invaders,Leapfrog and    
 Penetrator but our favourite game is  
 Manic Miner.In this game you have to  
 collect golden keys to open the door  
 to get out of the room,there are 20   
 rooms to complete which are very hard.</content>
