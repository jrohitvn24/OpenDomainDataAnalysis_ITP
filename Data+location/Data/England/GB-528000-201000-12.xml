		<title>12FACILITIES AT TOLMERS CAMP.</title>
		<content> On the site at Tolmers Scout Camp we  
 have got climbing and abseiling       
 facilities plus a climbing wall.We    
 have got a lake and some canoes but   
 after a while,scouts have broken the  
 paddles.Once every year we have a     
 "Come to Tolmers"fortnight where Cubs,
 Scouts,Brownies and Guides take part  
 in activities like, archery,first-aid,
 air-rifles,climbing,abseiling,rafting,
 canoeing,pioneering,car maintainance  
 and site service. There are also      
 courses in forestry,camp-cooking and  
 pioneering,the former is a fourteen   
 day course spread over the year,      
 whilst the others last for fourteen   
 continuous days. Wild life abounds in 
 the area and all visitors are welcome 
 providing they report to the warden on
 arrival.In 1985 Tolmers have been     
 hosts to the archery events in The    
 World Games.                          </content>
