		<content> In spring{beef cattle}have their      
 calves.Each year there is a different{
{letter}to call them by. If the year   
 was letter{A,}and the calf was a{girl,
 the name might be{Ada.}If it was a boy
 it might be called{Alan.}             
 If all goes to plan the best calves   
 get{auctioned}in summer. Before going 
 to auction they would be tied up with 
 a very loud{radio}next to them so that
 they wouldn't get scared when they    
 were there!                           
 In autumn the cattle are rounded up   
 and put inside the{shippon}and fed on 
{cow cake,hay,straw}and{silage}during  
 the winter.
