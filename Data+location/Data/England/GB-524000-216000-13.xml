		<content>{TYPES OF FARMS}                       
 There has been farming in and around  
 Datchworth for over 900 years. The    
 soil in this area is clay based and   
 this has given rise to a mixture of   
 different land uses for farming. There
 are 3 main farms in this area: 1) Bury
 Farm - Wheat,Barley,Rape Oil Seed,    
 small herd of beef cattle. 2)Coltsfoot
 Farm - Peas,Corn,Wheat,Barley.        
 3) Hawkins Hall Farm - Shetland Horses
 and Ponies.                           
{BURY FARM}                            
 This is the biggest farm being 218    
 hectares in size. It is over 300 years
 old. The present family have been     
 farming it for 72 years. The farmer   
 employs 2 full time workers. His main 
 worries are vandalism to machinery and
 over production of crops. He also     
 thinks that he will be producing more 
 vegetables in the future.             </content>
