		<title>01The Village of Milford</title>
		<content> The village of Milford covers two     
 square kilometres. It is a typical    
 Surrey village with a playgroup, two  
 schools, three churches, several shops
 &amp; a wide variety of organisations &amp;   
 clubs for all ages. The village is    
 surrounded by wide areas of commonland
 &amp; farmland. Walkers &amp; horse riders can
 both enjoy the beauty of the          
 countryside well away from the busy   
 roads which criss-cross the area. The 
 most widely grown crops are cereals   
 and potatoes &amp; there are several      
 pick-your-own facilities for soft     
 fruit &amp; vegetables. In the N.W.       
 corner, Peperharow Park, with the     
 river Wey flowing through it from     
 Elstead to Eashing, provides a        
 beautiful setting for the therapeutic 
 communty for adolescents for which    
 Peperharow School is now used.
