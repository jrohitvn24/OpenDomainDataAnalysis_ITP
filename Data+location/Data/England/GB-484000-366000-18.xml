		<content>   Almost allthe area around Eagle is  
 cultivated. The most important crops  
 that are grown in the area are oil    
 seed rape,potatoes,winter wheat and   
 winter barley.Other common crops are  
 stubble turnips,grass,spring          
 barley,carrots,and sugar beet.        
   Less common crops that are grown in 
 the area are triticale, rye, lupins,  
 linseed, evening primrose,and duram   
 wheat. Evening primrose and lupins    
 go to the drug industry.Triticale is  
 grown because it is high in protein   
 and fibre and it is used for bread    
 making and so is duram wheat.Oil seed 
 rape is often used as a break crop.   
 This means it rests the land and helps
 to get rid of pests. Its oil can be   
 used to save on imports and it is     
 profitable to farmers. It is used in  
 the making of margarine and cooking   
 oil.                                  </content>
