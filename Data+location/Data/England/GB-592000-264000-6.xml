  BULLDOG---OR BRITISH BULLDOG         
                                       
  Bulldog is a boys' game. Someone is  
Â£it' in the middle. He calls someone's 
name and that person has to try to     
cross to the other side of the         
playground without being caught. If he 
gets across, then everyone else tries  
to get across. If anyone is caught,he  
helps Â£it' to catch some more people,  
until only one person is left.         
  If Â£it' shouts BULLDOG they all run  
across, and if someone is caught while 
the others are still running, he might 
be given a fright!                     
  In some cases, the person caught has 
to be lifted off the ground before he  
is properly caught.
