 and Coleman's Hatch is the Primary    
 Health Care Team under the            
 NHS.,consisting of a GP, a District   
 Nurse, Health Visitor and a midwife.  
 A larger Health Centre in Forest Row  
 also has patients from this area.     
   The GP in Hartfield dispenses       
 most drugs from the surgery, the      
 nearest chemist being at Forest Row,  
 along with the nearest dentist.       
 Ante-natal, innoculation and cytology 
 clinics are held in both practices.   
 Mothers have the choice of delivery at
 Crowborough Hospital 7 miles away or  
 Pembury Hospital, 13 miles.The        
 elderly are cared for in their own    
 homes as much as possible with the    
 help of the District Nurse.The Queen  
 Victoria Hospital in West Sussex, and 
 the Kent &amp; Sussex Hospital in
