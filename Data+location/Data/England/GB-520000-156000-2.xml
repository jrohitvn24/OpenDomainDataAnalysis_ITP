 year at about the same time. It is    
 organised and run by the{Tadworth     
{Village Association.}Membership is    
 open to all local residents and       
 organisations free of charge.         
 A committee is elected consisting of a
 chairperson, a treasurer, a secretary 
 and 6 other members. The objective of 
 Village Week, as it says in it's      
 programme, is to get{'local peopleto  
{meet each other and enjoy themselves.'
   The{theme}this year was{'The Good   
{Old Days'}and people are asked to show
 this on their floats and in their     
 dress in the Carnival Procession.     
   Although not in Village Week itself 
 the first event is the selection of   
 the{Tadworth Rainbow Princess}from the
 local girls. The winner leads the     
{Carnival Procession}through Tadworth.
