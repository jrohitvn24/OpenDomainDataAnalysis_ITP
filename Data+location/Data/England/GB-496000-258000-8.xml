		<title>08Sharnbrook's Shoppers</title>
		<content> There are 6{foodshops}in Sharnbrook   
 which sell groceries, fresh fruit and 
 vegetables, meat, and bread and       
 confectionery. {Mobile shops}selling  
 frozen foods, fresh fish, and fish and
 chips call at the village.  People are
 happy to use the local shops for last 
 minute items and fresh foods, but most
 people seem to do their main shopping 
 weekly, or monthly, in the larger     
 shops of{Bedford and Rushden,}where   
 cheapness and convenient car parks    
 make the supermarkets attractive.     
 People are inclined to travel further 
 when they are shopping for clothes -  
 to{Milton Keynes, Cambridge or        
{Peterborough.} Rushden is popular for 
 shoes as there are a number of shoe   
 factory shops there.                  
 Few people buy goods from door to door
 salesmen, but half the people shop by 
 post from mail order catalogues.      </content>
