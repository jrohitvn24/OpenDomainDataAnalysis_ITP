		<title>03The Harrowby Land Settlement</title>
		<content> The Harrowby Land Settlement was      
 established after the First World as a
 group of smallholdings.In 1985 the    
 original farm settlements still all   
 exist but most are no longer          
 smallholdings.The majority of the     
 farmsteads have been sold off as      
 private dwelling houses and are either
 detached or semi-detached homes.All   
 the farming land is now farmed by the 
 tenants of the two adjacent           
 farms,Heath Farm and Coldharbour      
 Farm.The settlement is associated with
 a well known local land owner and     
 agriculturalist of the 1920s and the  
 1930s:Christopher Turnor the last     
 private owner of Stoke Rochford       
 Hall.Turnor Rd, like Turnor Crescent  
 in Grantham is named after Mr Turnor  
 who was a mayor of Grantham in the 30s
 and who contributed money towards town
 council houses and the Land Settlement</content>
