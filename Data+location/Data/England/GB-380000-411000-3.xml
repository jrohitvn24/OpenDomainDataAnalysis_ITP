		<title>03 Bury General Hospital</title>
		<content> The hospital was opened in 1882 but   
 not in its present form, more like a  
 pharmacy. The newest section of the   
 hospital is the records section, built
 just outside casualty. The oldest     
 sections are the private wards,       
 William Street ward and the board room
 which was once a chapel for the{dead. 
                                       
 There is a new{body scanner}which has 
 just been bought by public            
 subscription. There are on average 20 
 operations a day in the two theatres. 
 The{NHS}wards have 33 beds each while 
 the{private}wards have 12 single rooms
 per ward.                             
                                       
 There are around 800 people employed  
 in the hospital. The nursing school   
 round the corner has been open 19     
 years and takes 50 students per year.
