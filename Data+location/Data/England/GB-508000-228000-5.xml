 daddy is a farmer. This is a typical  
 day of his life in June. From{0615}he 
 attends to the chickens and dogs and  
{goes to work.}He meets the seven farm 
 workers to discuss the day's schedule,
 and gets the machines filled with     
 sprays or water. At{0800}there is a   
{breakfast break.}Afterwards he goes   
{crop spraying.}When he has finished he
 has lunch, collects eggs and feeds the
 pets. After lunch he cleans dirty     
 machinery and supervises repair jobs. 
 He checks the crops for diseases and  
 predators. At{1700 he has tea with the
{family.}After this he orders          
 fertiliser for autumn, makes telephone
