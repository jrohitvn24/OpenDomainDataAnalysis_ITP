		<title>04WILTSHIRE WILDLIFE</title>
		<content> Wildlife is very much in evidence, and
 up to sixty different species of bird 
 are known to breed regularly in this  
 area. They include: Rooks, Doves, Wood
 Pigeons, Cuckoos, Robins, Finches,    
 Tits, Wagtails, Sparrow Hawks, Wrens, 
 Kestrels and Lapwings. Game birds such
 as  Partridge and Pheasants (including
 a strain of White Pheasant) are seen  
 wandering about the fields and copses.
 Roe-deer are now well established on  
 the Plain and two were seen on our    
 visit to Normanton Gorse. A large     
 community of rabbits was seen near one
 of the Long Barrows, with signs of    
 stoats and weazles too.  Foxes and    
 vixen can be heard at night as they   
 search for food.  Field mice, voles   
 and shrews are much sought after by   
 Kestrels and Owls and can be seen     
 regularly hovering over the fields and
 grass verges in search of food.       </content>
