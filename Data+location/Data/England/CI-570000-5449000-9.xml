		<content>    There my tour ends, and I hope that
 you enjoyed it as I did. My favourite 
 part was reaching the top and taking  
 in the magnificent view over Gorey    
 harbour and the Island to the west,   
 St. Catherine's Bay, and the Royal    
 Bay of Grouville, with yachts dotted  
 here and there on its calm blue sea.  
 And all along the horizon to the      
 east the coast of France. I could     
 almost imagine that I was one of those
 archers, hundreds of years ago,       
 watching through the slits for the    
 French, and helping to keep our castle
 and Island from their clutches.       
                                       
    The castle figures prominently as  
 one of the major tourist attractions  
 in the island and receives more than  
 100,000 visitors every season.
