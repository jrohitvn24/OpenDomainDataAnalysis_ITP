		<content>    Compared to other major towns and  
 cities, Worksop has a low incident    
 rate for fires. There are fewer       
 firemen working in Worksop because    
 there are not so many large fires     
 expected.                             
    From the fireman's point of view   
 the people of Worksop are quite       
 friendly.                             
    Most fires in Worksop are caused by
 human negligence.                     
    The Worksop fire station is manned 
 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. There
 are 34 people working at the station, 
 17 retained officers, one sub-officer,
 three leading fire-officers and 13    
 firemen.
