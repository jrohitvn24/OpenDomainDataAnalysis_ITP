		<content> We decided to look at employment in   
 Hexham.And thought that our class     
 would be a good example. In our class 
 there are 37 children.                
 1 .59  parents of class 10 work.      
 2. 18  fathers work in Hexham.        
    18 fathers work elsewhere.         
 3. 17 mothers work elsewhere.         
    6 mothers work in Hexham.          
 4. In 9 cases both parents work in    
 Hexham.                               
{FATHERS }Those who work in Hexham work
 in various places in the town.Some    
 fathers travel to Newcastle and some  
 travel to other countries.            
{MOTHERS}most mothers who work,work in 
 Hexham.Only 6 go elsewhere.           
  In our opinion this is because Hexham
 is a small town and does not have a   
 lot of jobs whereas Newcastle is a big
 town with lots of job opportunities.
