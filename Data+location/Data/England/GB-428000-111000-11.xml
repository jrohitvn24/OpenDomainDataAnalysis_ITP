		<title>11The Parish Council Personnel</title>
		<content> The{Chairman}of Bartley Parish Council
 is Mr Derek Carter who is also        
 Headmaster of Calmore Middle School.  
 He has been Chairman for 3 years.   He
 has also been a District Councillor.  
 He thinks that the job of the council 
 is to tell the more important District
 and County Councils what the people   
 want.   The Parish Council itself has 
 few{Powers.} Mr Carter says that it is
 his job to stop people from talking on
 one Subject too long and sending other
 people to sleep.   The bit of the job 
 he likes best is meeting people, the  
 bit of the job he likes least is when 
 people become unpleasant at meetings. 
 The Chairman has no Chain of Office or
 special robes, but he does have a paid
 clerk ( part-time, not elected ) to   
 help him run the meetings.   Mr Carter
 has once been asked to open a caravan 
 and camping rally.                    </content>
