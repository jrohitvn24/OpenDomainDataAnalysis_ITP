		<content>  Religious beliefs, or lack of them,  
 are now more openly discussed but a   
 small minority maintains the ancient  
 church. Any hint of collapse or       
 closure arouses keen but short lived  
 interest. At least six families travel
 out of the village to worship         
 elsewhere.                            
  Social attitudes differ horizontally 
 between some recent arrivals and true 
 natives, particularly in what they    
 expect from village life. On the one  
 hand a desire to urbanise with street 
 lighting, mains drainage and an       
 adventure playground; on the other, a 
 desire for the status quo, if not an  
 impossible return to 'things as they  
 used to be'.                          
  As in all walks of life there are    
 differing attitudes in a vertical     
 sense between generations,most obvious
 here between farming fathers and sons.</content>
