		<content>{Interview with Mr Skelton.}           
 We went to a farm in Serlby and asked 
 the owner a few questions. Mr Skelton 
 grows sugar beet, barley, potatoes and
 peas. The sugar beet goes to Newark   
 factory. The barley goes to various   
 places.Some is used for seed, some for
 brewing and some is exported. The     
 potatoes go to Leicester to make      
 crisps. The peas go for freezing. He  
 has 450 acres of land.Some is rented  
 and 170 acres is his own.He rents the 
 land from  Lady Agnew. His land is a  
 sandy loam. The fertilizer he uses for
 potatoes is 7 parts N, 14 parts P and 
 28 parts K; for sugar beet it is 7    
 parts N, 8 parts P and 22 parts K; for
 corn it is 20 parts N, 14 parts P     
 and 14 parts K. N stands for the      
 nitrogen content,P for the phosphate  
 content and the K is for the potash   
 content.                              </content>
