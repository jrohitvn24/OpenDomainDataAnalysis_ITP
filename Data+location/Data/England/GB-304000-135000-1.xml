		<content>      This is an area of very{steep    
{hills}rising to over 350 metres in    
 much of the South of the Block.   The 
 steepest sides of the hills are       
 covered with{woodlands}- both conifers
 and mixed deciduous.                  
     The only area of{settlement}is in 
 the small but attractive village of   
{Monksilver}in the North East Square of
 the block.                            
     There is a little community at the
 bottom of the steep and winding       
{Sticklepath Hill}who are often        
 concerned by the number and size of   
 vehicles passing their properties.    
      Also within this Block is the    
 historic and still very interesting   
 complex surrounding{Combe Sydenham.
