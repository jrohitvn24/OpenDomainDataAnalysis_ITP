		<title>06A day at school 3</title>
		<content> Afternoons at school are usually good 
 fun.  We do more practical sort of    
 activities in the afternoon.  We often
 work in groups and have a parent in to
 help us.                              
                                       
 Activities include needlework, model  
 making, woodwork, clay, painting and  
 drawing.  In the winter we have games 
 lessons where we can choose to do     
 netball or football.  In the summer we
 have cricket and rounders.  We also go
 swimming everyday if the weather is   
 suitable.                             
                                       
 The school has a large field, two     
 playgrounds and an outdoor swimming   
 pool. It is not heated and sometimes  
 the water is{freezing.}               
                                       
 School ends at 3.40 pm.
