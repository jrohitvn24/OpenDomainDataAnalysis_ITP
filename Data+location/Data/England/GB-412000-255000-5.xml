		<content> I usually get up by myself then I get 
 my trousers and socks on. I go        
 downstairs to have my breakfast. I    
 have weetabix and sometimes I have    
 marmalade sandwiches. I go upstairs to
 brush my teeth. By then it is quarter 
 past eight. I put my shirt and tie on 
 then put on my tank jumper. I say     
 goodbye to Mum then I walk to school  
 or sometimes I go on my bike. After   
 school I walk home. When I've got home
 I watch the telly and I play with my  
 friends, we play football. It is      
 lucky for me because I have some      
 friends who live quite close.         
 Sometimes they come to my house and   
 sometimes I go to theirs.I have tea   
 with my Mum and my sister.Then I go to
 bed, by then it is eight o'clock. I   
 get to sleep very quickly.
