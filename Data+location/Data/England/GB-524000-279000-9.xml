		<title>09Recreational Facilities</title>
		<content> Little and Great Raveley have little  
 in the way of organised recreation in 
 their villages apart from those which 
 are home based, although there are    
 allotments available.  Wistow, a      
 larger village, has more facilities.  
 A small playgroup and a recently      
 completed BMX track cater for the     
 village children.  Many indoor        
 activities are based at the Public    
 House where Darts and Pool are played 
 in the local league and where dominoes
 are also available.  More varied sport
 facilities are provided at St. Ives   
 and Huntingdon.  With the nearest     
 cinema and theatre 7 and l3 miles away
 television and the recent introduction
 of home videos provide an important   
 area of recreation.  A limited amount 
 of game shooting takes place and the  
 Fitzwilliam and Cambridgeshire        
 Harriers occasionally hunt the area.  </content>
