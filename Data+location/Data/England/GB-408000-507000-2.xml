		<content>{Dalton,}the ton or town in the dale is
 situated on the lower slopes of{Gayles
{Moor}overlooking the valley which was 
 formed by the{Teesdale Glacier}during 
 the last ice age. The field pattern   
 near the village is of medieval       
 origin.South of the village is an Iron
 Age Fort called{Castle Steads.}Further
 South is an upright block of stone    
 called{Stone Man,}where was formerly a
 large cairn. The stones were carted   
 away to make fences and the skeleton  
 of a man found under them was         
 reburied. A mile S.E. of Stone Man,   
 another tumulus was opened in the 19th
 Cent. to reveal a{cist-vaen,}or{stone 
{chest}and within this was a{kale pot.}
 Near this village also known as{Dalton
{Travers}was a field which was held    
 under the curious{tenure}of that{"of  
{finding a grindstone for ever for the 
{people of the place".}                </content>
