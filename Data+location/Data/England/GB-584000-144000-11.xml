		<content> This land East of{Headcorn village,}  
 lies in the{Weald of Kent.}which is   
 known as the "Garden of England" -    
 famous for it's fruit, vegetables and 
 flowers. It is sheltered by a Ridge of
 higher land to the North,and was once 
 part of the great FOREST OF ANDERIDA  
 There are still woods and coppices    
 here and although some trees have been
 felled for various reasons, care is   
 taken not to cut too many. Due to the 
 number of{ponds}and the{River Sherway,
 a stream that converges with the      
 larger{River Beult}half a mile to the 
 South, the area is subject to damp,   
 mists, and fog during the Autumn and  
 Winter months. Keen North-East winds  
 affect this part of Kent,but in Spring
 and Summer,milder air from the South  
 brings warmth and showers for the     
 growing plants and crops.
