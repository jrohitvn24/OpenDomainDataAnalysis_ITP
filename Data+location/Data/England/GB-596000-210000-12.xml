		<content> Our village was around before William 
 the Conqueror wrote the first Domesday
 Book.   St Mary's church was built    
 about 1000 years ago, it was built    
 beside the Village Green which was the
 centre.   Bohuns Hall is an old house 
 and there are some 18th century houses
 round the Green.   We have an old     
 "Lock_up" by the church where         
 criminals were kept.   In Woodrolfe Rd
 there used to be a level crossing     
 which the "Crab &amp; Winkle" railway ran 
 through.   In the old days most       
 people in the village were fishermen. 
  The men wore smocks with the name of 
 their boat on .   They used to say    
 that there was a secret passage from  
 the church to monks house.   An old   
 person gave us this information.
