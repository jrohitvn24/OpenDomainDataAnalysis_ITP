		<content>                                       
 The health of the people of this area 
 is well taken care of. There are two  
 main health centres,one each in       
 Sandhurst and Yateley with additional 
 surgeries in the area, with nurses and
 doctors in daily attendance who       
 provide not only routine medical care 
 but a certain amount of emergency     
 help. There are two  opticians as     
 well as three dental                  
 surgeries.There is no longer a        
 hospital in Yateley but Frimley Park  
 close by is modern and very well      
 equipped with an accident and         
 emergency department and specialist   
 care departments too. Other  hospitals
 nearby are two at Reading and one in  
 Aldershot providing not only routine  
 hospital care, but specialist         
 facilities too.
