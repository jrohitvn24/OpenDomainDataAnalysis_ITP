		<content>{ St.Michael's Hospice}is to be found  
 adjoining the{Bartestree Convent,}and 
 its purpose is to treat people who    
 have{terminal illnesses,}usually      
 cancer patients.                      
  The nurses do their best to make the 
 last weeks and months of the patient's
 lives as comfortable as possible.     
  The hospice was built in 1980,       
 designed by architect Mr.Nigel Dees,  
 but was planned as far back as 1970.  
  Funds from the{Freda Pearce          
{Foundation}as well as other charities 
 and private donations, raised the     
 money to build the hospital, which is 
 still paid for by charities and       
 private fund raising, and is          
 unconnected with the National Health  
 Service.                              
  The largest number of people who may 
 stay at any one time is 10, out of a  
 catchment area of all Herefordshire.  </content>
