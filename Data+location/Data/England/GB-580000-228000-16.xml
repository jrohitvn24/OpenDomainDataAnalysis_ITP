		<content> My house is owned by the council but  
 we are hoping to buy it from them very
 soon. It is semi_detached. It is up a 
 hill and the road is called Windmill  
 Road because there used to be a       
 windmill at the top of the hill. There
 is none of the building left. We have 
 three bedrooms and a bathroom upstairs
 and two rooms downstairs. We have a   
 big back garden where my sister and I 
 play. The front garden is small. We   
 have a small kitchen and a big sitting
 room. We have a gas fire not a coal   
 fire to keep us warm in the winter. We
 have a very tiny hall. My house is    
 with a lot more houses, twenty seven, 
 that are the same. I live on the even 
 side of the road. My house is built of
 red bricks and the roof is grey       
 slates.
