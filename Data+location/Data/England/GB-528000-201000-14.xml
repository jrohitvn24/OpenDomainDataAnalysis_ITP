		<title>14A DAY IN THE LIFE OF ANDREW.</title>
		<content> Another hectic day begins.My brother  
 says,"Mum it's seven o'clock."and I   
 wake up to kettle boiling and taps    
 running.I get up, walk down stairs in 
 to the kitchen, that is the most      
 hectic room.My dog is running about   
 knocking over the bin.My Mum shouts at
 my brother,tells me and him to stop   
 arguing and throws the cat out just   
 after it came in! My Dad is off to    
 work and my brother is off to school, 
 8.30am I am out of the house. 3.30pm  
 back home,4.15pm my brother is back   
 home.He leaves his stuff by the door, 
 gets crisps and milk and then sits    
 down. Then my Mum makes the tea.9.00pm
 I go to bed and my Dad is still not   
 home.Later I waken,I hear my Mum      
 talking to my Dad, the time is 12.30am
 so I go back to sleep. by ANDREW
