		<title>11A HOPPING GAME/3-6 PLAYERS</title>
		<content>          {Eggy Peggy                  
 This is a game for 3-6 players.One    
 person stands opposite the others and 
 chooses a group of something,ie games,
 films,names,etc.The other players then
 choose something in this group,and    
 each whispers it to the person next to
 her.This goes on to the end of the    
 line,when the last person calls out   
 the choices to the person on the      
 opposite side of the play ground.The  
 person at the other end of the        
 playground chooses one of the games   
 (or other subjects),and calls it out  
 to the other players.The person who   
 chose the particular game that was    
 called out hops into the centre of the
 playground,and so does the person on  
 the other side of the playground.They 
 nudge each other gently,while still   
 hopping,and the first person to stand 
 on 2 feet loses the game.             </content>
