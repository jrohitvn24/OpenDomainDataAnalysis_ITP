		<title>20THE PROGRESS THEATRE</title>
		<content>{  Progress Theatre,The Mount,Reading.}
   The Progress Theatre is small and   
 they cannot fit all the things in     
 there.  They have to keep some things 
 in a store room somewhere else.       
  The actors have to use heavy lipstick
 because the lights would make the     
 lipstick seem dull. The theatre has   
 104 seats.  In the winter they had to 
 get the heaters to go in the dressing 
 rooms.                                
   They have small lights. Sometimes   
 they have big iron struts but         
 sometimes they have a lot of small    
 wooden struts for the lights. They    
 have a special work shop for repairing
 lights.  Sometimes it takes a long    
 time to rehearse a play.              
   Mrs Thorpe one of our teachers has  
 been in several plays, one of which   
 was "Blithe Spirit".
