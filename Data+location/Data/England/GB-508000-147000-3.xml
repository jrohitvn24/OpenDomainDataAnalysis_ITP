 Abinger Hammer and Gomshall are both  
 small villages but are popular with   
 visitors to the area. Abinger Hammer  
 is well known for its village clock   
 and bell. The bell is struck on the   
 hour by a model blacksmith.  This is a
 reminder of the forge and ironworks   
 that used to flourish in the area.    
                                       
 Gomshall is known for its tannery and 
 the old mill.  The presence of the    
 leather industry in the area is said  
 to date back to Norman times.  The Old
 Mill is now a restaurant.             
                                       
 Antique shops are to be found in both 
 villages together with an art gallery 
 in Gomshall.
