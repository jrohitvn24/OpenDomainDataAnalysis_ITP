		<title>15INGROW -southern Keighley</title>
		<content>{    Ingrow}is on the southern edge of 
{Keighley. }The{River Worth}flows past 
 Ingrow on its way to Keighley.In the  
 Worth Valley there is the famous      
 Keighley{Worth Valley Light Railway.  
 It runs on steam from{Oxenhope}to     
 Keighley.  Its most famous station is 
{Damems}which boasts the shortest      
 platform in the world.  It also got a 
 prize for being a pretty station.     
     The river valley is steep sided   
 and still has many small woods which  
 go back to ancient times.  On the hill
 tops farms have changed moor-land into
 dairy farmland.{Friesian cows}and also
 sheep are seen on the hill-side but   
 the cows are kept indoors on cold     
 winter nights.  In winter the cows are
 fed on{silage and dairy nuts}but in   
 summer their feeding is controlled by 
 electric fences to help the grass to  
 grow properly.                        </content>
