		<content>{The Gymkhana and Fun-day.}            
 Sampford Arundel Primary School  held 
 a Gymkhana ans Fun-day on the 16th of 
 June. There was a Horse Show and Dog  
 Show, also several other stalls like a
 Lucky Dip and Shooting Stall. I       
 especially liked the stocks. I was in 
 the stocks at one time and I can tell 
 you it was absolutely awful when lots 
 of people were throwing wet sponges at
 me. The Fun-day did very well and     
 raised Â£1,200 which all went to school
 funds.
