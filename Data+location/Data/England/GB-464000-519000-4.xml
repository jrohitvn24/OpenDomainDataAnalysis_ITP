		<title>04HOUSING IN SALTBURN</title>
		<content> Saltburn's housing shows a mixture of 
 styles since its growth from a hamlet 
 in the 1860's. The terraced housing in
 the Jewel Streets remain in good      
 condition. Many of the largest houses 
 have been converted into flats. Others
 are still used as Guest Houses. The   
 railway divides old Saltburn from     
 later construction in the late 19th   
 and early 20th Century. Most is       
 terraced but includes old town housing
 (Glenside) extending into a small post
 war private estate. The other housing 
 is found along and off Marske Road. To
 the north an inter-war estate can be  
 found, to the south a post war private
 development (Wilton Bank) and a       
 Council estate (Woodrow Avenue). On   
 the Guisborough Road there is the Hob 
 Hill Private estate. Approx. 70% of   
 housing is owner occupied, 13% council
 housing and 13% rented accommodation. </content>
