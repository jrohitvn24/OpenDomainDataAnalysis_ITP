		<content>  Mr. Smith has taught at Kingsmead for
29 years, having been Headmaster for 10
years in the local comprehensive. He   
has witnessed vast changes in the      
education system. "For a start", says  
Mr. Smith, "many new subjects have been
introduced like Environmental Science, 
Sociology, Computer Studies, so there  
is a wider choice of subjects for      
pupils." With the introduction of      
videos and computers, teaching         
techniques are more audiovisual rather 
than the normal chalk and blackboard   
ones. There is a wider variety of      
children from different walks of life  
coming to the school. Introduction of a
6th form in 1974 allowed pupils to     
continue advanced study without having 
to travel to Cannock or Stafford. In   
1985 education cuts have led to the    
amalgamating 6th forms in local        
schools.                               </content>
