		<title>04My House.</title>
		<content> I live in a semi_detached house in a  
 residential area.My house has seven   
 rooms we have a bathroom and three    
 bedrooms.Downstairs there is a front  
 room where we watch television and sit
 comfortably on easy chairs.We also    
 have a video recorder which means we  
 can watch programmes when we like.At  
 the back is the dining room where we  
 eat most of our meals.It has a table  
 and four chairs, a sideboard,a        
 bookcase,a piano and a budgie cage.I  
 practice the piano in this room to    
 give the others some peace.The kitchen
 has an electric cooker, a             
 fridge-freezer,a wash boiler and      
 tumble drier. The back garden has a   
 big lawn with two sheds and a patio.  
 The front garden is mostly gravel     
 where we park our car.
