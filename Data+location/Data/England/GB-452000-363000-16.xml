		<content>{MY COLLECTION OF DOLLS.               
 I collect dolls from around the world 
 because I like their dresses and they 
 are not too expensive.I have 14 dolls,
 3 Spanish,5 French,1 Dutch,1 Austrian,
 2 Italian and 2 American.             
    My Paris doll looks like this:     
 It has a red hat and dress,in the hat 
 is a white fluffy feather.The dress   
 has a picture of the Eiffel Tower and 
 a yellow ribbon in a bow at the back. 
 All my dolls are kept in a display    
 cabinet in my bedroom.                
{BMX BIKES.                            
 A BMX is a light weight bike,it is    
 stronger than other bikes because of  
 the things it does.You have to wear   
 special clothes with padding,a crash  
 helmet and boots.The bikes do tricks  
 like an{Aerial}where you ride up a    
 ramp very fast and turn in mid-air.   
 They also do free styling.            </content>
