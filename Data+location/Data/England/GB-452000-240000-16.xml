 registration followed by assembly.Our 
 school work was cented around the     
 Domesday Project.We had lunch at 12.00
 o'clock.We had chunks of meat,        
 potatoes,cabbage and gravy. We had    
 a biscuit for afters.                 
 In the afternoon I used paint and     
 pastels to draw some of my ideas.We   
 also played rounders.We went home at  
 3.45pm and I went to my friends for   
 tea.I helped wash up and put away.    
 In the evening I took my dog for a    
 walk and tidied my bedroom.I went to  
 bed about 8.30pm.

 during one day.                       </content>
