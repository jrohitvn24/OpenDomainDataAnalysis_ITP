		<title>17The Glassworks [continued]</title>
		<content>The glassworkers take a metal stick and
place it in a kiln where the           
temperature is between 1240 degrees C  
And 1500 degrees C.It then comes out   
with what looks like a ball of fire on 
the top.This ball is blown into shape  
using tools made out of pear wood[which
is the only tool made of wood which    
wonÂ£t burn] and metal tongs.They make  
the glass shape and leave it to cool.  
Upstairs the cutting is done.First the 
little part of the glass which has been
attached to the stick is cut off by the
gas flame.The top of the glass will    
still be quite sharp so it is put into 
a sort of kiln on a wheel which makes  
the top smooth.Black felt tip lines are
then put onto the glass so that the    
cutters know where to put the engraving
marks.The glasses are held by the      
cutter onto a wheel which has an edge  
made of diamond so it cuts well.       </content>
