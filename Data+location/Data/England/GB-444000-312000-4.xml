		<content>  I go to{Warren Hills Primary School  
 (384 pupils) which is one of three    
 schools on a campus at 456148.I       
 started school the term after I was   
 five.My school is 'open-plan' unlike  
{Broomleys School}down the road (401). 
 When I am 11 I will go to{Castle Rock 
{High School}(705) which is just the   
 other side of our football pitch.I    
 will stay there for three years.      
 At 14 I will move on to{King Edward   
{VII Community College}(1107),which is 
 next to the High School,for two to    
 four years.I already visit this school
 for swimming and the theatre.The      
 Community College runs courses in the 
 evening as well as during the day.    
 Adults and children can use the       
 College for sports,crafts and academic
 classes. A lot of my friends go to    
 clubs at the College and some went to 
 Denmark with the Gymnastics Club.     </content>
