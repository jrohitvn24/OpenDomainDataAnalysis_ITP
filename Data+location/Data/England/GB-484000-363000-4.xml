		<content> Morton Hall is a large Victorian      
 country house, situated in extensive  
 grounds.It was a private house until  
 the 2nd World War when the whole site 
 was taken over by the RAF, who built  
 huts which are now used as prison     
 accomodation. During the 1950's the   
 Prison Commission acquired the site   
 and opened Morton Hall Borstal. This  
 flourised until the mid 70's when     
 pressure on accomodation eased,       
 allowing the establishment to be      
 moth-balled. For a brief period the   
 officers quarters and kitchen were    
 used to accommodate the Vietnamese    
 refugees. For most of the time Morton 
 Hall has been held on a care and      
 maintenance basis by a small works    
 crew. It was opened again in May 1985 
 as a prison for 150 category 'D'      
 prisoners to ease overcrowding in     
 Lincoln and other prisons.            </content>
