 people are commuters,organisations    
 within the village are still available
 The Women's Institute meet once a     
 month and has approximately sixteen   
 members.Their ages range from 30 to 65
 and consist of a mixture of old and   
 new inhabitants.Few W.I.members       
 support their county activities but   
 local group meetings (with nearby     
 villages) are popular;any village or  
 church function is supported by the   
 women i.e.The Flower Festival held in 
 the church and the May Fair on the    
 village green.The Parish Church is the
 link for all sections of the community
 in Lyddington.There is a Mother's     
 Union and an active Sunday School.A   
 senior citizen club known as the Horse
 shoe Club meet monthly.There are 60   
 members which includes people from    
 other villages.                       </content>
