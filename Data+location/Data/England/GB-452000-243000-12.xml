		<content>Apart from the usual topics always     
under discussion there are two major   
projects to be considered by The Parish
Council 1985/6.                        
The first is the construction of two   
bedroomed bungalows for senior citizens
on land owned by the village in        
Towrise. A public meeting has been held
and   it was agreed to go ahead with   
the project.These homes will first be  
offered to residents of Sulgrave,      
living in three bedroomed council      
houses.This should then release the    
larger houses for younger families.    
The other project is the provision of  
children's playground equipment on the 
playingfield in Towrise.Some parents   
are liasing with the Parish Council and
enquiries are being made about possible
grants.Extra funds will need to be     
raised by the village.
