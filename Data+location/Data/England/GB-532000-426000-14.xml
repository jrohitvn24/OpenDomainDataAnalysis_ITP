		<title>14CHILDREN'S GAMES,WITHERNSEA</title>
		<content>  In British Bulldog someone is chosen 
 to be the catcher and stands in the   
 middle of a rectangular area about the
 size of a tennis court.All the other  
 children stand at one end and one is  
 chosen by the catcher to try to run by
 him to the other end without being    
 caught.If he is caught he joins the   
 catcher and someone else is chosen.If 
 he gets through all the others have to
 try to avoid those in the middle and  
 get to the other end.Anyone caught    
 joins the catchers.The game ends with 
 all the children caught.              
  In Stuck in the Mud one person is the
 catcher and the others have to be     
 caught by being touched.They then     
 stand still with their legs apart     
 until freed by another player crawling
 under them.The catcher has to try to  
 catch everyone and stop those already 
 caught being freed.                   </content>
