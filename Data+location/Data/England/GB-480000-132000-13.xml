		<title>13Plastics Factory, Passfield.</title>
		<content> Situated close to the River Wey,      
 Auriol Plastics set up their factory  
 in 1972, partly in the old brick      
 building clearly dated 1857. It is a  
 thriving industry making household and
 garden requisites,and involves coating
 metal with plastic. It offers valuable
 employment to 68 men and women,10 in  
 modern office block alongside. This is
 almost certainly the site of Domesday 
 Book corn mill, the iron 'hammer' from
 late 1500's to 1684, also the paper   
 mill from 1684-1924. Paper for        
 banknotes was made here, and the mill 
 at work is remembered by local        
 people. Descendants of the family who 
 ran the paper mill until 1904 farm    
 nearby.                               
  A small business employing 15-20     
 people supplies garden sheds and other
 portable timber buildings all made    
 from sectional panels.                </content>
