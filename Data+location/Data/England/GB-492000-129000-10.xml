		<content>  In 1985 people in this area live in  
 houses and bungalows which are either 
 terraced,semi-detached or detached.   
  Many people live on farms or in  farm
 cottages.Some of the farm houses are  
 very old.Shonks Farmhouse was built in
 1540 or possibly earlier.Walls of     
 wattle and daub have recently been    
 uncovered.A brick outside oven was    
 also discovered.                      
  Many people live in houses which are 
 converted places of work.There are    
 several 'Forge Cottages'which were    
 once local forges.The Toll House in   
 Northchapel collected the dues from   
 travellers travelling between London  
 and Petworth.Vine Cottage was the     
 local harness and saddle makers.
