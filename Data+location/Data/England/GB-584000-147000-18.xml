		<content> Farming is one of the jobs in our     
 D-Block.  Farmers employ people to    
 help them with many tasks, such as    
 looking after the animals,sowing and  
 harvesting.  In the summer people     
 often work as pickers on the farms.   
 They are paid piece rate which means  
 they are paid for the amount they have
 picked.                               
      In Ulcombe there is a paper label
 factory.  They donate old barrels of  
 unwanted sticky labels for the annual 
 school bonfire.                       
      Many people who live round here  
 work in offices in Maidstone, or even 
 travel to London by car or train.  The
 village shops employ people as        
 assistants and of course there are    
 also the people who work in all the   
 schools in the area.
