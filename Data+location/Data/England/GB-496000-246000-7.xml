		<title>07Oilseed Rape Production</title>
		<content> Pioneered as a crop by a local seed   
 merchant,oil was largely used for     
 lubrication but poisonous substance   
 now bred out and new varieties produce
 oil for margarine and cooking oil with
 the advantages of high boiling point  
 and runs off fried food easily.The    
 crop suffers from flea and pollen     
 beetle.Sprayed, formerly from the air 
 but protests from Bee keepers led to  
 the development of insecticide        
 harmless to bees.Now ground spraying  
 avoiding critical flowering           
 time.Harvested either by spraying to  
 kill greenery and then combined,or    
 swathed,cutting a 9" stalk and left   
 for a week lying to dry off           
 leaves,then combined with a Rape      
 pick-up head.Can be a problem to      
 combine directly.Also harvesting      
 must be done before the before the    
 pods pop.Yields !.5 tons per acre.    </content>
