		<content> More and more land in our area is     
 being used for{housing for commuters. 
                                       
     Behind our house there used to be 
 a big overgrown field which the people
 round my way called{THE JUNGLE}. One  
 morning I woke up and heard a         
 chugging. I ran into my brothers room 
 but couldn't see anything. I ran      
 downstairs and unlocked the backdoor. 
 I looked through the fence which was  
 made from metal wire and saw a JCB    
 unloading bricks.                     
                                       
     Over a period of about one and a  
 half years they've built a new estate.
 They've put up a big fence which stops
 us playing football because the ball  
 keeps going over and we can't get it  
 back.                                 
                                       
                                       </content>
