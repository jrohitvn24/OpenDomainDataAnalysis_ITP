		<content> Out of 45 children we interviewed:    
 in 38 cases one of their parents drove
 to work every weekday, 5 walked and 2 
 caught a bus. We found out that 28 of 
 these people work in Exeter, 8 work in
 Silverton, 2 travel outside of Devon. 
 Only 3 people worked in Tiverton and  
 one each in Stoke Canon, Broadclyst   
 and Cullompton.                       
    Silverton is fortunate because the 
 Exeter to Tiverton bus service runs   
 through the village. The route starts 
 in Exeter, runs through Stoke Canon,  
 Rewe, Thorverton, Bickleigh, Silverton
 and ends at Tiverton. Fourteen buses  
 use this route a day. The earliest bus
 from Tiverton is 0838 and the latest  
 is 2313. The earliest from Silverton  
 is 0815 and the latest bus is at      
 2250. The earliest bus from Exeter is 
 0737 and the latest is 2220.
