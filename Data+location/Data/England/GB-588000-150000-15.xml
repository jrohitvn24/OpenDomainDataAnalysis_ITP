		<content>  Another time in the same hotel an old
 man checked in and was given the key  
 to room no.7.This man wasn't feeling  
 well but went up into the room with   
 his cases.That night,feeling very ill,
 he needed a drink.A maid carrying a   
 candle and dressed in Tudor clothes   
 came in with a cup of water.The next  
 morning the man offered his thanks for
 the water brought during the night but
 no-one in the hotel knew what he was  
 talking about.                        
      There is a place that is known as
{Suicide Corner}. A young mother, who  
 lived in a house on that corner, was  
 feeling very depressed and she shot   
 herself, leaving her young baby       
 unattended. Soon it started to cry of 
 hunger but no-one came and at last the
 poor baby died. People claim that they
 can hear its sad cries and some even  
 say that they have seen the mother.   </content>
