 At the North end of Scampton is       
 Tillbridge Lane Viewpoint.  It is on  
 the top of a steep slope called the   
 limestone ridge; locally known as     
 Lincoln Cliff.                        
 Although it is only 46 metres above   
 sea level a good view is obtained of  
 the plain below.  To the West can be  
 seen the River Trent and along its    
 banks are the cooling towers of 3     
 power stations; High Marnham, Cottam  
 and West Burton. The coal comes by    
 rail from the East Midlands. The      
 waters of the Trent are used in the   
 manufacture of electricity. The waste 
 fuel ash is used to manufacture       
 building blocks.  East of the River   
 Trent is the smaller River Till and to
 the South Fossdyke canal, originally  
 built by the Romans.
