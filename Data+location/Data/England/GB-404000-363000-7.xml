		<content>     Transporters for the cattle       
markets are Jeff Mellor, Bert Proctor, 
Sam Garlic, Eric Williams, Donny Moss, 
Glen Garlic and many others.  They will
take your cows, sheep, goats, horses,  
pigs, foals, sometimes donkeys, calves,
lambs, bulls and bullocks.  If you     
can't get there yourself they will take
you as well.  The price you pay is     
about 15 pounds and if you want to     
bring some back they will bring them   
back for you if you pay them some more 
money.  The cattle market days are     
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday,  
Friday and Saturday.  There are pens   
for the animals to wait in.  The       
milking cows get chained up in a       
different part.  The bulls get chained 
up with the cows.  The seats are made  
of bricks and wooden tops.  Some people
give a lucky quid.  The calves are in a
different part as well.                </content>
