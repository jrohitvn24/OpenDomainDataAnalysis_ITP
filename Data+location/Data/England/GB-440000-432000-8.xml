 banks and a post office. There are 3  
 chip shops and a chinese restaurant.  
 On{Saturday}the stalls of{asmall open 
{market}occupy a carpark. After        
 interviewing shoppers we found that   
 because of it's friendly atmosphere   
 Mainstreet attracts custom from other 
 areas including{Crossgates, Kippax,   
{Micklefield}and{Leeds.}Most people    
 found the shopping facilities adequate
 though some felt stores selling mens  
 and childrens wear, books, curtains   
 and a coffee shop would improve       
 present amenities.                    </content>
