		<content>   Evenley Hall is a large house on a  
hill between Brackley and Evenley. The 
National Children's Trust own it now   
but it was built in 1740 by a Cornish  
man called Francis Bassett.            
   In the bad winter of 1897 there was 
a fire at Evenley Hall. Fire engines   
in those days were pulled by horses    
and when at last the firemen reached   
it and tried to pump the water, it     
froze in the hose! The Hall was not    
badly damaged but needed a new roof.   
   Until recently Evenley Hall was a   
children's home . Children lived there 
if their parents had broken up or were 
ill. At one time there were fifty-     
seven children in five groups,each     
group having a House Mother and Father.
In 1980 it was made into a home for    
disabled young people. They come during
the day to do craftwork and gardening  
and to enjoy each other's company.     </content>
