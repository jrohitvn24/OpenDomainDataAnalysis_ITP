		<content> As can be seen from the land cover and
 amenity count, the area is very rural.
 It is all divided into fields with    
 well established hedgerows. There are 
 some areas of woodland but all are    
 small and scarcely on a commercial    
 scale.                                
 One main road runs through the area   
 the remainder being country lanes. The
 main road is just an "A" class road   
 having been improved in places but not
 really suitable for heavy goods       
 traffic. It is used primarily by      
 commutors, many travelling to the     
 Nuclear Power Station several miles   
 further down the coast.               
 Animals can be seen grazing on most of
 the fields, the land being fairly low 
 lying but undulating. The highest     
 point in the area is High Park (247m) 
 which is not divided into fields and  
 is fairly rough grazing land at best. </content>
