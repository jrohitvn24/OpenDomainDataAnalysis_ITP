		<content>     The topic we decided to cover was 
 Employment.  We  went  around the     
 Fingerpost area of St.Helens and asked
 people the following questions.       
 1"Do you think that the Youth Training
 Scheme is giving young people a taste 
 of working life?". Ten people replied 
 "Yes", six replied "No".              
 2"What  do  you  think  will  stop the
 falling  rate  of  employment?". Eight
 people thought more investment was the
 answer.                               
 3"Compared  to  other  parts  of  the 
 country, do you  think  St.Helens has 
 a  high  or  low  employment  rate".  
 Fifteen  people  replied  "Low", one  
 person replied "High".                
 4"Do you think to much money is spent 
 on Defence when it could  be  put  to 
 better  use?".  Nine  people  replied 
 "Yes", seven people replied "No".
