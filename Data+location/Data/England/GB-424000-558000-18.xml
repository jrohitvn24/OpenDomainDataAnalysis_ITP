		<content>   The disposal works are situated on  
 the site of an old Roman camp, hence  
 its name, Campground Refuse Disposal  
 Works. It has now become a landmark in
 Wrekenton and its chimney, about sixty
 metres high, can be seen all around.  
 Most rubbish comes from the town but  
 some is also broughtfrom Newcastle    
 and Washington. Private traders come  
 and pay to get rid of their waste.    
  The Incinerator was opened in 1975.  
 60000 tonnes of rubbish are burnt each
 year. In burning, the weight of the   
 rubbish is decreased by 50%  and its  
 volume by 75%. The residue after      
 burning is taken to a tipping site in 
 Birtley and is used for land fill. The
 plant is manned by 36 staff. It cost  
 Â£2000000 to build and Â£600000 a year  
 to run. Some people have said the     
 smoke is dangerous to health,but this 
 has not been proved.                  </content>
