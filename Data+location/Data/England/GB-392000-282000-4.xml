		<content> One is Halesowen baths and one is     
 Wollescote School Baths.Some people go
 to fairs.This is  place where there   
 are electrical rides for people to go 
 on.Some of our parents go to public   
 houses where alcohol is sold.Sometimes
 people sing or bands play to entertain
 you.The person that owns the pub is   
 called the licencee.He has his name   
 above the door.This shows he is       
 licenced to sell alcohol.Darts is very
 often played in pubs.This is a game   
 played on a circular board.There are  
 two players each has three darts.The  
 players throw the darts at the board  
 which has twenty-two segments.Each    
 segment is numbered and the person who
 hits the highest number wins.The      
 highest score possible is 180.There   
 are different versions to the         
 original game.One is called ROUND THE 
 BOARD and the other is HIGHEST SCORER.</content>
