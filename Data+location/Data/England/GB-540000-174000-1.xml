		<content>Eltham Church                          
The church of St John the Baptist,     
stands at the corner of Well Hall road 
and Eltham Hill on a site which has    
been occupied by a church since the    
mid twelfth century. The first         
Australian aborigine to have visited   
England is buried in its graveyard     
                                       
Avery Hill                             
The Avery Hill estate was laid out in  
the 1880's by Colonel North. It was    
Purchased by the LCC in 1902 and now   
much of it is open to the public. The  
mansion and Winter gardens now form the
nucleus of the Avery Hill College of   
Education although much of the house   
was  destroyed in World War 2. The 3   
original glasshouses still remain.     
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
