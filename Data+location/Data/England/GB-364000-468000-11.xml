		<title>11BENTHAM POTTERY</title>
		<content> There are two potteries in Bentham. We
 visited Low Bentham Pottery which is  
 owned by Kathy Cartledge. In the      
 gallery all the pots are on display.  
 One of the shelves has "seconds" on   
 it. Behind the gallery is the workshop
 where all the pots are made.  We      
 watched Mrs Cartledge throw a pot on  
 the wheel. We watched her helper      
 fettle pots. Fettling is cleaning pots
 and tidying them up.  Mrs Cartledge   
 uses stoneware clay. The pots are in  
 the kiln from 7.00am to 5.00pm. When a
 pot has dried out it is put into the  
 kiln to be biscuit fired, after that  
 it is dipped in glaze and then put    
 into the kiln again to be gloss fired.
 It comes out all shiny. The pots are  
 sold in the gallery and in shops all  
 over Lancashire, Yorkshire and        
 Cumbria.
