  Mr. Barrell usually buys three       
 hundred tons of silage for his cattle 
 in winter. The cows are milked at 6.45
 a.m. and at 4.30 p.m. He does not     
 employ anyone else but his wife and   
 two sons help out regularly. He has   
 two barns and a wide range of         
 equipment. He has a crop sprayer which
 he rarely uses as he is a keen        
 naturalist. He has three tractors and 
 a generator for milking. He rotates   
 his potatoes and turnips every year   
 and has Hereford and Fresian cattle.  
  The farmhouse was built in 1936 and  
 has seven rooms. He has two computers,
 a Land Rover and a car.
