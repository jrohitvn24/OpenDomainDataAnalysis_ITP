		<content> GLENRIDDING HAS A LONG HISTORY OF     
 MINING.  TODAY ALL THE MINES ARE      
 CLOSED, BUT THERE IS STILL PLENTY OF  
 EVIDENCE OF WHAT ONCE WENT ON.  THE   
 MAIN MINE WAS CALLED THE GREEN SIDE   
 MINE.  HERE LEAD WAS MINED AND USED   
 IN THE MAKING OF LEAD FOR ROOFS AND   
 PIPES . THERE ARE MANY MINE ENTRANCES 
 AND HOLES IN THE GROUND STILL LEFT.   
 THE SPOIL HEAPS STILL REMAIN AS UGLY  
 SCARS ON THE LANDSCAPE.  THERE ARE    
 ALSO OLD PIECES OF MINING EQUIPMENT   
 LYING AROUND ON THE FELLS AS WELL AS  
 EVIDENCE OF OLD MINE BUILDINGS.       
 TODAY SOME OF THE OLD MINE BUILDINGS  
 HAVE BEEN CONVERTED TO FORM           
 RESIDENTIAL CENTRES FOR OUTWARD BOUND 
 COURSES.  EVEN THE ROADS UP THE       
 VALLEYS WERE ONLY BUILT AS MINE ROADS.
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
