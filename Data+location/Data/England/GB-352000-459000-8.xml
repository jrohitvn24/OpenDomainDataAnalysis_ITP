The post office is a non cash sub post 
office and deals with pensions,T.V.    
licences,green giros,recorded          
deliveries,registrations,overseas      
services,postal orders and stamps but  
does not handle savings,road fund      
licences etc.It is also a general      
store selling groceries,sweets,crisps, 
tinned food,ice cream,biscuits,soft    
drinks,cigarettes and news papers.     
      Mrs.Ball manages the shop and    
says her busiest day is Friday and her 
quietest day is Wednesday.Most of her  
customers are regulars but the tourist 
trade is good particularly in summer.  
The most popular things that she sells 
are sweets,fizzy drinks and ice cream. 
They used to sell petrol but had to    
stop for safety reasons so the nearest 
petrol pump is now three miles away.
