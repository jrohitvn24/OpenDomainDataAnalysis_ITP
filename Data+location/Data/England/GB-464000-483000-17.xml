		<content> Youth (2).                            
       The following comments show the 
 feelings of many local teenagers. "I  
 like it here because I've got more    
 friends and it's quiet." "I like      
 living here because I've lived in a   
 busy area for most of my life and I   
 enjoy the peace and quiet." "I like it
 here. There's not a lot to do but we  
 play in the street and nup the cricket
 field." "I like it. There's quite a   
 lot to do. I help the farmers, go     
 fishing and walking. I go to the youth
 club in the winter." "I hope that the 
 village will stay as it is and no more
 houses will be built."
