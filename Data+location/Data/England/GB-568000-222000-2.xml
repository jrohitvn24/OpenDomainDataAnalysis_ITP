		<title>02  FARMING IN OUR AREA</title>
		<content>   In the twelve square kilometre      
 rectangle approximately 93% of the    
 land is open_space and 7% is built_up 
   There are 19 farms in this area of  
 land , most of which use their land   
 for crop_growing although on Onchors  
 farm approximately 31 acres is used   
 for grazing cattle. The field facing  
 Onchors farm is used to grow material 
 for thatching roofs of local cottages.
 Some farmers own woods where game is  
 kept for shooting. Farms in the area  
 vary greatly in size.                 
   Some local farmers refused either to
 be interveiwed or to allow the public 
 to view their premises. These were    
 battery farmers who were concerned    
 with the recent activites of the      
 Animal Liberation Front.              
   Land in this area could not be      
 described as flat or uninteresting.   
 The fields are divided by bushes.     </content>
