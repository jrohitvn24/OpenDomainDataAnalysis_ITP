 floods when the river Ouse is high.   
 At times up to seventeen houses have  
 been flooded.  There is no school in  
 the village, children from five to    
 eleven go to Naburn primary and eleven
 to sixteen to Fulford comprehensive.  
                                       
{ There is a Methodist church, with one
{service every Sunday, and a Sunday    
{school.  There is also an Anglican    
{church.  The village shop which stocks
{from food to shoe laces, is also the

{bread three times and fruit &amp;         
{vegetables once a week.  Milk is
