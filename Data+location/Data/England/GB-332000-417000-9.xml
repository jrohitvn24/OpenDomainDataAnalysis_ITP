		<title>09A School Day</title>
		<content> Friday 5th. July 1985.                
 9.10am. We go to our Parochial Hall   
 for assembly. 9.30am. We go to our    
 classroom and start with a spelling   
 test. 9.45am. Vocabulary exercise and 
 next week's spellings. At 10.30am we  
 go out to play until 10.45am when we  
 return to class for maths. For the    
 last 15 minutes we do S.R.A. At 12.00 
 pm we go to the cloakroom to collect  
 our packed lunches and put them in a  
 line on the playground until the      
 whistle goes at 12.30 when we go into 
 the canteen. At 1.25pm the bell goes  
 and we file into school to do craft   
 until 2.30pm when playtime begins.    
 Play ends at 2.45pm. Sometimes we     
 carry on with craft or we finish off  
 any work left from during the week. At
 4.00pm the bell goes and then we      
 can all go home.
