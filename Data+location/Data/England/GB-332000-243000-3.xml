		<content> The A438 Hereford to Brecon road      
 passes through the north-eastern      
 corner of the area and the B4352      
 Madley to Hay-on-Wye road runs across 
 the south-western section, closely    
 following the contour of the hills.   
 Connecting these is a network of      
 narrow lanes with high banks topped by
 hedges and trees. Transport services  
 in the area are very sparse. There are
 school buses daily from Bredwardine, a
 daily bus to and from Hereford, and,  
 on market days, a weekly bus to       
 Hereford and to Hay-on-Wye. At        
 other times there is no means of going
 shopping, or of attending doctors' or 
 dentists' surgeries (which are outside
 the area), other than by private car. 
 Thus it is essential for every family 
 living in the area to have a car, or  
 at least easy access to one.
