		<content> Not all my Saturdays are the same so I
 will just write about one.I got up    
 about 8.00 am and took my dog for a   
 walk. Then I had breakfast. After that
 I asked my friend to come over and    
 then we played{cards}and after that we
 played on my{Computer}. After lunch I 
 went{swimming}in my friend's swimming 
 pool and then we played on their{     
{Spectrum Computer}using a game called 
{'}SCHOOL DAZE{'}in which you are a{   
{Schoolboy}and the idea of the game is 
 to hit all the shields without getting
 a{1000}lines. Then after that I went  
 home and then my other friend came    
 over. Then we watched{television}for a
 while, then he went home . At about 6 
 o'clock I had dinner . After I went   
 and got changed and then I went to my 
 friend's{DISCO!}until 10:00 p.m and   
 then I went to bed.
