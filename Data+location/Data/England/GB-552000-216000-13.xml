		<title>13Hatfield Broad Oak Farms: 2</title>
		<content>{Information derived from an interview 
{   with a local farmer - continued.   
{ }Britain's membership of the European
 Economic Community has had some effect
 on the type of crops grown; for       
 instance, local farms are now growing 
 some French varieties of wheat. Also, 
 the past few years have seen notable  
 increases in the yields: an area which
 a few years ago was producing 1.5 to 2
 tons per acre will now be yielding 3  
 to 4 tons. Farmers depend on the EEC  
 for their markets and much locally    
 grown corn is now sold abroad.        
   Carefully controlled stubble burning
 is carried out to help to prepare the 
 land for the following season's crop. 
 Other recent changes in farming       
 methods have meant the loss of some   
 hedgerows and the reduction in height 
 of others to make possible the        
 efficient use of machinery.           </content>
