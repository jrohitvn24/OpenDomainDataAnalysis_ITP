		<content>  The primary school at present has a  
 roll of 48 boys and girls aged 4 - 11.
  Following county policy there is only
 one intake of children in September.  
 Children from Loweswater, Buttermere, 
 Embleton and Wythop are brought in by 
 mini-bus. There are 2 full time and 1 
 part time teachers plus secretarial   
 help midday cum kitchen assistant and 
 caretaker. Numbers will probably      
 decline gradually over the next few   
 years to be mid 30's since more leave 
 at 11 each year than start at 4.      
 Nearly all children go to Cockermouth 
 School at 11 an odd one goes to       
 Keswick School.  The school has a     
 board of Governors.  There is no      
 P.T.A. but parents are very supportive
 in any fund raising which must be done
 to maintain funds. Several children   
 from the area go to junior schools in 
 other towns.                          </content>
