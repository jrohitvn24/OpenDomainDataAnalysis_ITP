		<title>03Ecology of the Nibley area.</title>
		<content> This area, typical of the surrounding 
 Gloucestershire countryside, is well  
 balanced with trees and hedges        
 dividing the fields which support the 
 wide range of natural wildlife. The   
 woodland is fairly dense but kept in  
 order. It consists mainly of beech    
 with a scattering of oak, birch,      
 sycamore and conifers. The woods are  
 inhabited by badgers, foxes and other 
 small rodents. Beaneath the rotting   
 leaf-litter,various species of insects
 live, feeding off debris and each     
 other. The pathways are wide and well 
 defined. They are kept clear and easy 
 to follow. Pollution is not a real    
 problem at the moment, but the nearby 
 power stations are causing growing    
 concern. This area as a whole is kept 
 free from litter in the streets and   
 countryside.
