		<title>04Carrington House in Deptford</title>
		<content>   Carrington House is a men's hostel  
with 550 beds.It costs twelve pounds a 
week for a cubicle with bed and chair, 
and fifteen pounds sixty pence a week  
for a lockable cubicle. There is a can-
teen, a common room where men can cook 
their own food, two TV rooms &amp; a games 
room. It is very clean and no alcohol  
is allowed in the building.The methers,
dossers &amp; tramps seen around Deptford  
do not usually live in the hostel. Many
of the men,however,have problems. There
are post-psychiatric patients who are  
unable to look after themselves.Many of
them have marital, drink, gambling  or 
drug problems.  There is one  welfare  
officer but the men are just as likely 
to go to cleaners &amp; porters with their 
problems as to him. The  staff do not  
try to reform the inmates but are will-
ing to give help and advice. The hostel
is also used by the single homeless.   </content>
