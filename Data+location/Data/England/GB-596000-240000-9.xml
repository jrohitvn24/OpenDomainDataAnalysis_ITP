Miss Osborne made most of the kneelers 
in Boxford Church, she started in 1978 
and the first one she made had a       
picture of the first man on the moon.  
The materials used for the kneelers    
were given by a Hadleigh factory and   
the stuffing was given by a villager   
called Mr. E.A. Locke.  There are 200  
kneelers and each one is about an event
which has happened over the last few   
years mainly about the village.  About 
30 people have helped Miss Osborne.    </content>
