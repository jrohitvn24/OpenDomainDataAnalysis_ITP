		<title>06SCREDINGTON RECOLLECTIONS.</title>
		<content> Mrs  Bell is an old lady who has lived
 in Scredington all her life."The      
 school is similar to what it is       
 now.There was an Infant room and a    
 Junior room.There was a big slab in   
 the playground to separate the boys   
 from the girls.We didnt wear a        
 uniform.The lessons were just writing 
 and arithmetic .There were no         
 organised games.There was a village   
 shop .Every Sunday we went to the     
 chapel Sunday School.It was a big     
 Sunday School.The event of the year   
 was the outing to Bell house farm.We  
 all used to pile into a cart pulled by
 horses and sit in the barn for        
 refreshments.It was the most exiting  
 thing happened to me.We used to live  
 in a farmhouse and we had horses. My  
 dad worked on the land and earned 28  
 shillings a week.In other ways village
 life has changed very little."        </content>
