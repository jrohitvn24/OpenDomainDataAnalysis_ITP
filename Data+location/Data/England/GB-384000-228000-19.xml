 because of its closeness to the M5 &amp;  
 M50 motorways,its tranquil rural      
 setting and its proximity to more     
 famous centres of interest.  The      
 nearest site is{Tewkesbury}with its   
 Abbey, Elizabethan and Georgian       
 buildings and the River Avon.         
{Cheltenham,}the Regency Spa Town with 
 its quality shopping is ten miles away

 literary festivals.{Gloucester's      
 Cathedral attracts millions of

 Triennial "Three Choirs Festival".
