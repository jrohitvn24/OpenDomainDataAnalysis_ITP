		<title>03Kielder Salmon Hatchery</title>
		<content> When Kielder Water was formed,and the 
 valley was flooded, many of the       
 salmons' spawning grounds were lost.  
{Northumbrian Water}decided to make    
 amends for this by establishing a     
{salmon hatchery.}It was set up on the 
 ourskirts of Kielder Village, on the  
 banks of the Kielder Burn.            
 The Hatchery has been very successful 
 in its aim to rear salmon from eggs,  
 and has released  more than 1 million{
 salmon{parr}into the River Tyne and   
 its tributaries.                      
 About 20% of these make the journey to
 feeding grounds off{Greenland},and    
 about 15% manage to return to the{    
{Tyne.}This could mean some 15,000     
 large fish making "home runs".        
 It is possible to book visits to the  
 Hatchery ({Wednesdays}) through the   
 Tower Knowe Kielder Water Information 
 Centre.                               </content>
