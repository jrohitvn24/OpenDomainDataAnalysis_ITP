		<title>16RELIGIOUS PROVISION</title>
		<content> APART FROM THE ROMAN CATHOLIC NUNS WHO
 HAVE THEIR OWN CHAPEL WITHIN THE      
 CONVENT AT PITSFORD, THERE IS NO      
 ALTERNATIVE PROVISION FOR OTHER       
 DENOMINATIONS THAN ANGLICAN. SEVERAL  
 YEARS AGO THERE WERE TWO CHAPELS WHICH
 PEOPLE IN THE AREA MIGHT ATTEND - ONE 
 IN PITSFORD, WHICH HAS SINCE BEEN     
 CONVERTED INTO A HOUSE - AND ONE IN   
 CHAPEL BRAMPTON WHICH WAS REPLACED BY 
 A SMALL WOODEN HUT SOME YEARS AGO, BUT
 IS NEVERTHELESS STILL USED BY THE OLD.
 LOCAL ANGLICAN CHURCHES ARE "ALL      
 SAINTS" AT PITSFORD AND "ST.BOTOLPH"  
 IN CHURCH BRAMPTON.                   
 THE FORMER RECTORIES OF THESE TWO     
 PARISHES ARE NOW PRIVATE HOUSES AND   
 THE INCUMBENT OF BRAMPTON LIVES IN A  
 SMALLER HOUSE ON THE SITE. PITSFORD   
 HAS NO RECTORY AND HAS ONLY A SHARED  
 PRIEST WITH THE PARISH OF KINGSTHORPE.
 SERVICES ARE HELD EACH SUNDAY.        </content>
