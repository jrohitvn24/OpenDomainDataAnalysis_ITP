		<title>01LITTLEPORT, CAMBRIDGESHIRE</title>
		<content> Littleport is a village of 6000       
 people, sited at the north end of a 30
 metre high hill, sticking up out of   
 the flat fen country. In the{Domesday 
{Book}31 men lived there. The          
 settlement would have been dry above  
 the fen, which flooded in the winter, 
 and next to the River Ouse, which     
 provided trade and eels. The hill soil
 is clay, but it is surrounded by rich 
 fen peat, reclaimed in the C17, when  
 the area was drained by{Cornelius     
{Vermuyden.}Local people objected to   
 the improvements and later, in 1816, 5
 were hanged during the {Littleport    
{Bread Riots.}                         
 Fishing and wildfowling now only occur
 as sport. Arable farming is still the 
 important source of income, while     
 river transport has been superceded by
 road transport, there being several   
 lorry firms.                          </content>
