		<title>05OLD GRANARY CONVERSION</title>
		<content>  Mrs Lake converted the old granary   
 outside her home into a Roman Catholic
 Chapel in 1951.                       
  On the ceiling of the chapel there is
 a pretty arab tent which Mrs Lake     
 bought at a junk auction not realising
 how much it was worth. The Marquis    
 D'Oizie, a friend of Mrs Lake's       
 recognised what it was worth so they  
 put it on the ceiling of the chapel.  
  There is a pedal organ which is not  
 played anymore but is still in tune.  
  The weekly service is on Saturday at 
 18.00 and lasts for half an hour and  
 anyone can come.                      
  It is called the Chapel of the       
 Annunciation because the Protestant   
 church in the village is called St    
 Mary the Virgin which is the first    
 great mystery and the Annunciation    
 follows.                              
                                       </content>
