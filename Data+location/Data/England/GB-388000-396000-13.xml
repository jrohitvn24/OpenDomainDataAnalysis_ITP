		<title>13Interesting People _ Gorton</title>
		<content> The first person that I interviewed   
 had lived in Gorton for 42 years. He  
 said that he had seen many changes in 
 the area during that time. Many of the
 old terraced houses had been          
 demolished and the traditional        
 engineering works had been depleted.  
 The locomotive and steel works had    
 gone and many people have been forced 
 to leave. He preferred the area in the
 past for its friendliness but living  
 conditions were better now. He said   
 that he felt that there was not as    
 strong a sense of responsibility and  
 caring as there used to be especially 
 for the old. He used to work for an   
 engineering firm in West Gorton but   
 was made redundant when it closed.    
 After that he worked in a shop for a  
 year before becoming chief cashier at 
 a bingo and social club. Past events  
 best remembered were the Whit Walks.  </content>
