		<title>11The Carnival</title>
		<content>     Every  year  at  the  end of July,
 Bakewell  Carnival  takes  place.   It
 lasts for one week, and many different
 events  take  place,  something  every
 evening.                              
     Thursday must  be the highlight of
 the week, because on that  evening the
{raft race }takes  place.   Anyone  can
 take part and there are prizes for the
 best  decorated  rafts as  well as the
 fastest  rafts.   The  rafts  have  to
 travel about 1km  along the{ River Wye
 from Wynn's Meadow to the Park.  There
 must be two people on each raft.  Last
 year two competitors made  a model  of
{Noddy's car,}complete with a radio!   
     The raft race  is  followed by the
{Jack Russell Races.  }Fluffy toy hares
 are pulled  along on  string,  and are
 chased by the dogs.   Some dogs  don't
 bother to run,  and  this causes great
 amusement for the spectators.         </content>
