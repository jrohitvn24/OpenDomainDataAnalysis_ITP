		<title>12THE NEW BY_PASS</title>
		<content> Annfield Plain By-Pass was started in 
 Autumn 1984.The Eastern section goes  
 to Catchgate;the Western section to   
 Greencroft.Before the by-pass was     
 built there were woods,a pond and     
 fields.We know this because we visited
 the site with our teacher.            
 The by-pass will be built in different
 stages.First the ground is cleared    
 with an excavator and dumper          
 trucks.Next, dolomite will be laid and
 levelled with a grader and roller.A   
 roadbase and basecourse are laid on   
 top and finally a wearing course.A    
 roundabout will join the new road to  
 Morrison Road.                        
 Mr.Wingrove the engineer,showed us the
 ground being cleared on the newly     
 started Eastern section.Mr.Wingrove   
 hopes it will be open by mid 1986.We  
 enjoyed splodging in the mud best on  
 our visit to the site.                </content>
