		<title>19WHY MOVE TO CLEADON &amp; BOLDON</title>
		<content>     People move to Cleadon and East   
 Boldon for many reasons but mainly job
 promotions.A better position means    
 better pay and a better house. Some   
 people prefer rural to urban          
 living.Parents prefer their children  
 to grow up in a rural setting with    
 fresh air and open spaces.The villages
 are also ideal for commuting between  
 the larger towns of Sunderland &amp; South
 Shields &amp; also the City of Newcastle. 
 Some moved into the area when they    
 were married &amp; others needed a        
 larger house as the family increased  
 but wanted to live within the         
 atmosphere of a village.A move may be 
 necessary to be near parents or other 
 members of a family.The last reason   
 mentioned by our parents was choosing 
 a school for the children.
