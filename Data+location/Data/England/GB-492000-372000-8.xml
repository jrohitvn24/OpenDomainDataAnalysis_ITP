 The Stones public house is named after
 Henry Stone who was Lord of the Manor 
 of Skellingthorpe. He died in 1693. In
 his will he gave land to Christ       
 Hospital London. On the land they     
 built cottages, a school and an inn   
 which now bears his name and the coat 
 of arms of Christ hospital.           
 For the last 16 years the landlady has
 been Mrs Joyce Vaughan. The building  
 has undergone changes internally and  
 two rooms have been made into one     
 large smoke room. There is also a bar 
 and a beer garden.
