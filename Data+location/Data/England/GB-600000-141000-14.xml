		<content>Surrounded by a wide Ring Road where   
the traffic travels just one way       
round, stands the shopping centre.     
There is a wide variety of shops of all
sizes. Recently a  pedestrian only area
has been built covered over by roofing.
This is called the Tufton Centre. Cars 
to be parked in one of the many car    
parks and people can walk more safely  
from shop to shop. The main street is  
wide enough for an open market every   
weekend. The main library, bowls club, 
police station, a church and the       
Technical College all stand within the 
Ring Road. Some people travel out of   
town towards Chart to buy most of their
food at a huge supermarket.
