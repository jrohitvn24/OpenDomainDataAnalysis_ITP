		<content>    The BMX is one of the strongest    
 bikes. It is used for racing on dirt  
 tracks. There are all sorts of BMXs.It
 is one of the most popular bikes.     
    You can get aero frames on the PK  
 Ripper and on some more bikes.You can 
 get different sorts of brakes,there   
 are two finger brakes and long brakes.
 On my bike there are long nuts to     
 stand on they are called stunt        
 nuts.The BMX tyres have good grips for
 when you are on a dirt track.They have
 different names like butterfly and    
 snake belly.                          
    The BMX always has pads so if you  
 fall you dont hurt yourself.If you are
 racing you need protective clothing   
 and you have a helmet to protect your 
 head.
