		<title>11MY DAY AT THE FIESTA</title>
		<content>     About 100 balloons competed in a  
 spectacular weekend.My favourite      
 balloons were {DAWSONS TOYS ,         
{POLLYWALLETS, COLT CARS, PLANTERS     
{PEANUTS, MANSION HOUSE ,and SMIRNOFF.}
 They took off in the morning and again
 in the afternoon . In between that    
 there was a{Red Arrows }display. There
 was also a smoke balloonist from {    
{AMERICA}.The men in charge placed some
 wood on the grass and set fire to it  
 and they placed the balloon over the  
 fire . It would inflate slowly about  
 half an hour ,and when it was ready it
 would take off with him dangling .When
 he reached 200ft he jumped and opened 
 his parachute .He landed safely but   
 the balloon lands about 2miles        
 away.There was also a Radio 1 Road    
 Show with Dave Lee Travis.
