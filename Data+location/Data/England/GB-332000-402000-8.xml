		<title>08PEOPLE IN INCE BLUNDELL</title>
		<content>  We made a survey of all the          
 households in the village . We found  
 that the people of Ince Blundell form 
 a very close-knit community. They like
 having familiar faces around them but 
 resent the inevitable gossip and lack 
 of privacy.                           
                                       
 Our survey revealed a quiet way of    
 life with home-based activities, such 
 as gardening. reading and craftwork,  
 being the most popular pastimes.      
                                       
 People liked the quiet life and       
 lovely views but one common complaint 
 was the lack of a shop or post-office 
 and the lack of mains gas supply.     
                                       
 Almost all the people surveyed lived  
 in the village by choice and many     
 families have lived here for          
 generations.                          </content>
