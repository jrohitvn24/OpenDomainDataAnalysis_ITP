		<title>18RECRATION GAMES SURVEY LCING</title>
		<content> We sent a survey around our school to 
 discover the most popular children's  
 games.We were sent details of many    
 games played using a ball eg.rounders.
  The most popular activity for boys   
 and girls was sport.The most          
 interesting game we found was'Three   
 bad eggs'.The rules are simple;one    
 player is on andthey have the ball.The
 players who aren't on run around in an
 area while the player who is on throws
 the ball into the air and lets it     
 bounce.He then calls a name and steps 
 the number of letters in that name.   
 they throw the ball and call the name 
 again.If the ball hits the named      
 person then he becomes on.If the ball 
 misses then the original player stays 
 on.                                   
    Other interesting games included;
