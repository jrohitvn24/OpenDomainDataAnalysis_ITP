 Â£100,000 per annum. To run the school 
 the headmaster has help from six      
 teachers, a secretary, one welfare    
 assistant, a cook and two helps plus  
 three supervisors. Lessons consist of 
 work in Maths, Computors, English,    
 History, Geography, R.E., Science, Art
 and Craft.These lessons are supported 
 by educational visits to museums,     
 castles, theatres and generally places
 of interest.                          </content>
