		<title>05POPULATION IN MARSHFIELD</title>
		<content> Statistical figures are derived from  
 the electoral roll for the Parish of  
 Marshfield, which covers rather more  
 ground than the survey area.  The     
 total population of the Parish in     
 October 1984 was 1,221 persons,       
 comprising 428 households (an average 
 of 2.9 persons each).  Of these people
 225 (18.5%) were below the age of 18, 
 and 241 (19.5%) over the age of 60.   
 Population is growing slowly as more  
 houses are built in the village.  As a
 result, less than half the present    
 population was born in Marshfield.    
 The Parish Church records do not show 
 full demographic changes.  They       
 exclude, for example, cremations in   
 Bath or baptisms of other             
 denominations.  They do show an       
 average of 8 deaths, 5 marriages and  
 12 baptisms a year.
