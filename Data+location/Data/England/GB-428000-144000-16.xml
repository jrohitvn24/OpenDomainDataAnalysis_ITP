		<content>   This was St Peter's Day. It began   
 with people going to work, shopping,  
 doing housework and gardening. A      
 Monxton family was moving house and   
 there was a wedding in Monxton Church 
 at one o'clock.                       
   At 2.30pm. Amport Cricket Club 1st  
 Eleven opened their league match      
 against Bentworth in Hampshire County 
 Division 3. One player only actually  
 lives in Amport!                      
   Amport Church Fete was opened at    
 2.30pm. on the Green. Amport School   
 children performed Country and Maypole
 dancing having already danced at      
 Cricklade College, Andover, that      
 morning to celebrate International    
 Youth Year. An Open Flower Show, side-
 shows and competitions entertained the
 public. A train made by REME gave     
 rides around Amport House grounds.    
 Over Â£500 was raised.                 </content>
