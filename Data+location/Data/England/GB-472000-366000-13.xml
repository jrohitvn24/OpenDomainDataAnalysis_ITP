		<title>13OIL INDUSTRY EGMANTON</title>
		<content> Industry in the area is limited except
 for British Petroleum.                
 Drilling in this area started over    
 thirty years ago, and sixty eight     
 wells have been drilled in all. Some  
 were in the village itself, and       
 others were as distant as the next    
 parish.                               
 A collecting area was built at        
 Ladywood for the gathering and        
 processing of the oil. From here it is
 sent to Tuxford rail sidings for      
 transportation to the refinery.       
 Today only four wells are producing   
 oil within our area, and another well 
 is used for water injection and other 
 experimental purposes. The dwindling  
 oil production from the wells         
 indicates that the oilfield is        
 approaching the end of its useful     
 life.
