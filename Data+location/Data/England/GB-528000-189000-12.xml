		<content> At Hornsey Depot Electric Trains      
 (class no.312 and 313) are cleaned and
 serviced and maintained. The new{High 
{Speed Electric Train}(H.S.E.T.) class 
 no.225 is currently being tested on   
 track in the Hornsey sidings.         
                                       
 Many people from other countries come 
 to make their home in Wood Green,     
 usually because they have friends or  
 relatives already living there. Though
 there is unemployment some jobs can be
 obtained; housing is fairly cheap and 
 there are many rooms to be let. There 
 are Shops, Clubs, Banks and Places of 
 Worship especially for immigrants and 
 there is good Public Transport to     
 reach other areas. They will probably 
 settle in quickly and easily because  
 of the {Multi-Ethnic}nature of the    
 community.
