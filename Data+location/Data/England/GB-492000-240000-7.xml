		<content> 11) Demonstrations  of  how fires were
     tackled  over  the  ages. Ranging 
     from modern  American  and English
     engines rescuing  kissagram  girls
     from  tall blazing  buildings, to 
     engines pulled by shire  horses   
     putting  out burning barns.       
 12) Traction engines on display.      
 13) Minature steam train rides.       
 14) A  dog show,  and  gymkana - where
     unfortunately  one  young girl was
     thrown from a  horse and ended the
     day in hospital with a broken leg.
                                       
 There  were a  number of other  things
 including  many of  the   popular beer
 tents!                                
  One fireman recently received a medal
 for his work. As an added reward after
 rescuing the kissagram girls they each
 kissed him then took his trousers off.
 It made great day out.                </content>
