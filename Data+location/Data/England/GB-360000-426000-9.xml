		<content> PRIMARY EDUCATION IN HOGHTON          
 THERE WERE ORIGINALLY TWO SCHOOLS     
 SERVING THE VILLAGE OF HOGHTON.  THE  
 CHURCH OF ENGLAND SCHOOL WAS BUILT IN 
 VICTORIAN TIMES AND WAS SITUATED ON   
 THE MAIN ROAD, NEAR TO THE ENTRANCE TO
 HOGHTON TOWER.  THE BUILDING OF NEW   
 HOUSING ESTATES AT COUPE GREEN MEANT  
 THE CLOSING DOWN OF THIS SCHOOL AND   
 THE OPENING OF A NEW PRIMARY SCHOOL AT
 COUPE GREEN IN 1974.  THE OLD SCHOOL  
 IS NOW A PRIVATE HOUSE.               
 THE ROMAN CATHOLIC PRIMARY SCHOOL HAS 
 ALSO MOVED FURTHER AWAY FROM THE      
 VILLAGE.  IT WAS ORIGINALLY NEAR TO   
 THE CHURCH.  THIS BUILDING IS NOW USED
 AS A COMMUNITY CENTRE.                
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
