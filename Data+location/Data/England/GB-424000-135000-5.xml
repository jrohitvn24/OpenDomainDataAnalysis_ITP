		<content> Broadgate Farm, a typical Hampshire   
 chalkland mixed farm of 360 acres.    
 The stock consists of 120 milking     
 cows, 13O heifers, 250 sheep and a    
 small flock of pedigree Suffolk ewes  
 for ram breeding. Barley is grown on  
 110 acres with 250 acres of grass.    
 Milk production is 6500 litres per cow
 and sells at 15pence per litre. In    
 calf heifers sell at Â£550, calves at  
 Â£70/Â£100, young ewes at Â£70, and lambs
 at Â£45.  Grain yields average         
 45/50cwts, sell at Â£100 per tonne.    
 Animals are sold in the open market at
 Salisbury and Winchester, and at the  
 Sheep Fair at Wilton. Cows are no     
 longer milked by hand but put through 
 a rotary milking parlour, where milk  
 cups are attached to the teats and the
 milk is piped back to a tank and      
 cooled, thence transported in bulk    
 tankers to the factory.               </content>
