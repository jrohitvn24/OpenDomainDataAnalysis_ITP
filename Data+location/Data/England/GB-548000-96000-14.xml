 garage in Seaford.Saxon Lodge was     
 built in 1685.Beyond the site of The  
 Ritz Cinema,is the area where the     
 Pedlars were impounded if they had    
 been in Seaford for too long.Opposite 
 The Wellington Hotel was a pump(as it 
 was near the old quay) where the ships
 refilled their water.Sutton Drove was 
 the main road in those days.          
     During the time that Mrs. Goussen 
 has been in Seaford the seafront has  
 changed a lot.Cliton Place used to be 
 lined with trees and Broad Street used
 to have privately owned houses in it, 
 and only a few shops,it is quite the  
 opposite now.                         
     She sees a change in the type of  
 people that live in Seaford and she   
 thinks that it is not a pretty town   
 but it has character.The retired play 
 Golf,Tennis or work for Organisations.</content>
