		<title>12MR.PEACHEY, FARMER</title>
		<content>  {Mr. Peachey}has lived in this area  
 all his life.   He moved to{Donkeywell
{Farm,}just outside the village of     
{Quenington}in l97O.   It is a mixed   
 farm with cattle, pigs and cereal     
 crops.   The land which he farms is   
 grade three land which is not suitable
 for the growing of root crops.   Apart
 from himself there are five other men 
 working for him on the farm and each  
 one has a specific job.   The milk    
 produced is sold to the{Milk Marketing
{Board}and the pigs produced for bacon 
 are sold to the{Co-operative Society. 
  As an active farmer Mr.Peachey does  
 not have a lot of spare time but when 
 he does find the time he enjoys a game
 of tennis.    (The farm house has a   
 tennis court next to it).   Ideally he
 would like a farm with better land,   
 preferably by the sea.
