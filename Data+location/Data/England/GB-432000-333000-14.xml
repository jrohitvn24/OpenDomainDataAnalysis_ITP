		<title>14A DERBY SCHOOLGIRL'S DAY</title>
		<content> At 7.15 I am woken by the sound of my 
 electronic alarm clock. Mother makes  
 my breakfast of cornflakes and "jungle
 juice" before we leave home in the    
 car. She drops me off at school on her
 way to work. Dad is lucky - he works  
 near enough to walk.  We have so many 
 bags that it looks as though we are   
 going on holiday. School starts at    
 8.50 with calling of the register and 
 then all the girls assemble in the    
 hall for a short Christian service of 
 worship. We have eight lessons during 
 the day and lunch is served in school.
 During the lunch hour there are       
 sporting and musical activities while 
 a few girls use the school's computers
 which are still a bit of a novelty.   
 Today I have to rush to ballet studio 
 after school and it's 7.00 before the 
 family sits down to a meal. After that
 it's homework and TV then bed at 9.00.</content>
