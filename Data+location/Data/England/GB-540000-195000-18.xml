  One of the favorite leisure pursuits 
 we have now is{computer games}and t.v.
 In a survey of 11 year olds we found  
 that many children watch over 30 hours
 of{t.v.}per week. Many older people   
 like pubs and fishing and there are   
 other things that go on all year      
 round.                                
  In Winter we do sledging and a recent
 popular pastime in summer is B.M.X.   
 bike riding.  Some people like        
 gardening while others prefer more    
 active pursuits like going swimming.  
 The{scouts and guides}are very popular
 in Loughton and they go on camps and  
 do lots of activities.{Football}is    
 very popular in schools and Loughton  
 Boys run a number of teams for boys of
 all ages. Keep-fit is popular with    
 women and they can go to one of a     
 number of clubs.                      </content>
