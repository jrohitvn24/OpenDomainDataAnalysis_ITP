   The Shropshire Giant was a big man. 
 In fact he was 7ft 3ins tall and could
 walk at a speed of 8 miles an hour.His
 weight was 23 stones. People used to  
 call him the Shropshire Giant because 
 of his enormous size.                 
   He was born in 1853 over 132 years  
 ago and named Tom Dutton. He led an   
 interesting life. Part of it was spent
 travelling abroad with a circus where 
 he was billed as the Amazing Soldier  
 and wore a Roman style uniform. For   
 much of his life he had had to support
 his Mother, but eventually he married 
 Betsy Allmark. They had 7 children.   
 Tom helped to build Stoke on Tern     
 School and Church. He was able to     
 carry the massive blocks of sandstone 
 single-handed. He was a very gentle   
 man.He lies in Stoke on Tern cemetry. </content>
