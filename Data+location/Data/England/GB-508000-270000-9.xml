		<content>     Not surprisingly, the small amount
 of industry in the area has close     
 links with agriculture.   A mill, near
 the old Kimbolton railway station,    
 processes straw to make cattle food,  
 but, in spite of the intensity of     
 arable farming in the district, most  
 of the straw is brought considerable  
 distances by lorry.                   
                                       
     Less than a kilometre away, at    
 Blackwell Manor Farm, there is a      
 newly-opened food-mobile depot.  These
 one-man-operated lorries travel round 
 to farms, where they mill the farmers'
 own grain and mix it with concentrates
 to produce animal food.   Ten men are 
 employed at the depot, all of them    
 from outside the area.                
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
