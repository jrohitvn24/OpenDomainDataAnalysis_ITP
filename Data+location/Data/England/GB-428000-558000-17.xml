		<title>17HOUSING IN WASHINGTON</title>
		<content>    In{Donwell Village}we found that   
 half the 70 people interviewed owned  
 their houses, most had 3 bedrooms.    
 Nearly everyone liked their houses and
 thought that the range was wide       
 enough.  The majority interviewed had 
 previously lived in terraced property.
   Most houses in{Sulgrave}belong to   
 the{Development Corporation,}579 in   
 all. Many of the 104{private houses   
 have been built in the last 5 years.  
 But Sulgrave is now an undesirable    
 place to live mainly because of       
{vandalism}near the flats.             
   In{Usworth,}houses have been built  
 by the{Council}and{private}firms.  A  
 few people, working in{co-operatives, 
 have built their own.  Bungalows, link
 villas and stone built cottages are   
 some styles available.  Most have     
 gardens and many have garages or car  
                                       </content>
