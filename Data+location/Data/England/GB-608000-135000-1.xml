		<title>01North of the old cliff line</title>
		<content> The south side of the block overlooks 
 Romney Marsh and the English Channel. 
 To the north the ground slopes down   
 gently to the East Stour river with   
 views of the downs. There are a few   
 springs and brooks: drainage ditches  
 surround many fields. The soil for the
 most part, overlies Kentish Ragstone; 
 the north west corner is heavy clay.  
 Ther are plenty of hedges and patches 
 of woodland. Wildlife is varied       
 Thriving in the quiet spots. The main 
 livestock is sheep: beef cattle graze 
 in the summer-shedded in winter.      
 Poultry (hens turkeys) are kept       
 inside.Airfield SE corner, established
 1916, little used, being developed as 
 an industrial estate. Nearby are      
 relics of a pre WW2 fleet air arm     
 camp. Agriculture provides some work: 
 many are employed in nearby towns: A  
 very few commute.                     </content>
