		<title>07AN ELDERLY HAILSHAM RESIDENT</title>
		<content>   Mr Miller was born in Magham Down   
 in 1900 and had to walk 4 miles to    
 school at Hellingly Church. He then   
 moved to Hailsham and went to Battle  
 Road School. As a punishment the boys 
 were given the cane across the wrist  
 for talking, messing about and playing
 truant. He left school at 14 and      
 worked in his parents' laundry for    
 four years . He then married and got a
 job as a fireman. While he was a      
 fireman a bomb dropped in Vicarage    
 Field, the Post Office and everything 
 nearby was blown up. Mr Miller did not
 have any hobbies when he was young he 
 didn't join any clubs but he enjoyed  
 playing Cricket.                      
   He told us an old wives tale: there 
 used to be a deer paddock near the    
 Police Station, in it there were some 
 Peacocks and when they crowed it meant
 it would rain.                        </content>
