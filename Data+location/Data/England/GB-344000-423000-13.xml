		<content>  The two main crops grown on our farm 
are barley and potatoes.               
  We grow Spring Barley. This is sown  
in late March or early April depending 
upon the weather.If Spring has been wet
sowing is done alittle later. The land 
has to be ploughed and cultivated or   
rotavated.Sometimes it is sprayed with 
a chemical called "Round Up" which     
kills off weeds, even the stubborn     
roots of couch grass. After sowing the 
land is harrowed. This spreads the seed
more evenly. It is then raked to cover 
the seeds and to smooth out the surface
of the soil.Chemical fertiliser is put 
down. This is very expensive.Spraying  
is done several times during the summer
to protect the ears of corn. You can   
tell that this is necessary because    
the young shoots are too pale a green  
in colour. In late August or early     
September the barley is ready.(Contd.) </content>
