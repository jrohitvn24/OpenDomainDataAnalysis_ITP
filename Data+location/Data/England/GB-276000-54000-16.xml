		<title>16Crowdy Mill</title>
		<content> Crowdy Mill is just outside the       
 village of Harbertonford.  Our class  
 visited it earlier this term.         
                                       
 The mill has been restored by the     
{Dartington Trust,}and is now fully    
 operational.  Wheat is milled here to 
 make flour. The flour is sold in the  
 health shop at Totnes.                
                                       
 When we went there there was a        
 shortage of water so we didn't        
 actually see it working.  The mill    
 stones are powered by a{water-wheel.  
                                       
 Water is extracted from the River     
 Harbourne and carried to the mill in a
 leat.  After it has turned the wheel  
 the water is returned to the river.   
                                       
 It was very interesting.
