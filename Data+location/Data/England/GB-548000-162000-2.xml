		<title>02Chelsfield Primary School</title>
		<content> One hundred years ago Chelsfield      
Primary School served an area that     
stretched as far as Green Street Green 
and Pratts Bottom to the south,to      
Shoreham in the east and into Orpington
and then out to Crockenhill.           
 The pupils who attended this school   
stayed here until their formative      
education ceased at the age of 13 or   
so.They were crowded into 2 rooms and  
were segregated so that the boys and   
girl played in different yards and even
had separate entrances and cloakrooms. 
However,during the past few years the  
Victorian surroundings have been       
altered and improved to provide more up
to date accommodation.Inside the main  
building there are now 2 classrooms    
separated by an educational play area. 
One large class has been made into a   
dining and assembly area.Outside huts  
provide a class and resource room.     </content>
