		<title>18ADVENTURE CENTRE.</title>
		<content>   An adventure centre is situated in  
 the village of Braithwaite.The        
 building was originally a school which
 was owned and run by the chapel next  
 door,now disused.It has now been      
 transformed into an action centre,    
 catering for the 7-13 age group.Groups
 come to the centre and stay either for
 a weekend or for a week.              
   On the Sunday when we visited the   
 centre,a group of Brownies were just  
 arriving.They were remaining at       
 Braithwaite until the following       
 Friday.We were told that they planned 
 to visit Haworth,the home of the      
 Bronte Sisters and Cliffe Castle park 
 in Keighley.They were also planning to
 go on a selection of local nature     
 walks.The centre also has plenty of   
 leisure facilities,including sports   
 and camping equiptment.
