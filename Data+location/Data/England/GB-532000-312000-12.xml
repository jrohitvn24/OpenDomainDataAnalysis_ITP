		<content> HOME LIFE IS, IN THE MAIN, QUITE BASIC
 ALTHOUGH AS REGARDS ENTERTAINING AT   
 HOME, THIS IS QUITE POPULAR AMONG     
 LOCAL PEOPLE. AS THERE ARE FEWER      
 PLACES TO GO TO IN THE EVENINGS PEOPLE
 SEEM TO ENJOY COOKING MEALS FOR THEIR 
 FRIENDS AND FAMILY AND MANY PEOPLE ARE
 EXPERIMENTING WITH THEIR COOKING AND  
 TRYING CHINESE COOKERY AND OTHER TYPES
 OF COOKERY WITH PASTA SUCH AS LASANGE 
 AND MOUSAKKA WHICH ONCE UPON A TIME   
 WOULD BE UNHEARD OF IN THE AREA AND   
 THERE WOULD ONLY BE STRAIGHT FORWARD  
 COOKING SUCH AS ROAST BEEF AND        
 YORKSHIRE PUDDING OR HOTPOT WITH      
 DUMPLINGS MUCH LIKE THE NORTHERNERS.  
 BARBECUE FOOD IS VERY POPULAR AND IN  
 THE SUMMER ENTERTAINING IN THE GARDEN 
 WITH A BARBECUE IS BECOMING VERY      
 POPULAR. OF COURSE THIS WAY OF        
 ENTERTAINING IS LESS EXPENSIVE THAN   
 GOING OUT TO EAT.                     </content>
