		<content>  Of the 100 or so households in       
 Broadwell, half are owner-occupied, a 
 third are rented from the Local       
 Authority and the remainder are either
 rented privately or are Agricultural  
 Service tenancies. The older houses   
 are built of stone, most of the       
 council houses are brick, while a few 
 newer houses are made of artificial   
 materials. The local planning         
 Authority would require prominent or  
 'listed' houses to be built in natural
 Cotswold stone. About 6 cottages are  
 used by week-enders. There are several
 cottages and houses owned by people   
 who have come to retire.
