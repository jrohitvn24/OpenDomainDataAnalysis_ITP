		<title>18GREAT MEOLS:THE ELMS COTTAGE</title>
		<content> Mrs. Whylie's home was built in{1691  
 by the{Washington Family,}who resided 
 there for 5 generations. Constructed  
 of sandstone,the house boasted an     
 unusual roof-a boat!-owned by the     
 builder.This was removed a few years  
 ago because of Death Watch Beetle.    
 The house consists of 2 storeys,a     
 ground floor comprising hall,lounge,  
 kitchen,utility room &amp; drawing room   
 and  upstairs of 4 bedrooms and bath. 
 There are several unusual features to 
 the house;one of the windows is of    
 stained glass, as is the porch letter 
 box.                                  
 On land adjacent to the cottage is a  
 barn constructed of stone and locally 
 quarried sandstone.This barn was one  
 of the first to be built on this land 
 and features a weather-vane; rare in  
 these parts.{The Elms}is one of the   
 few remaining examples of{Old Meols. }</content>
