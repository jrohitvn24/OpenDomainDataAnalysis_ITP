 NEW ST. CONSISTS OF TWO PARALLEL      
 TERRACES OF BRICK BUILT,SLATE ROOFED  
 HOUSES,110 YEARS OLD.  MY HOME HAS 3  
 BEDROOMS AND DOWNSTAIRS IS A KITCHEN  
 LOUNGE AND A DINING ROOM. IN 1963 A   
 BATHROOM WAS ADDED AND RECENTLY A     
 SHOWER UNIT.  MY FRONT DOOR OPENS     
 STRAIGHT ONTO THE PAVEMENT AND AS THE 
 GARDEN IS SMALL I PLAY IN THE PARK.   
 MY PARENTS ARE SAVING SPACE BY FITTING
 BUILT-IN BEDROOM FURNITURE,OUR CENTRAL
 HEATING USES SMOKELESS FUEL BUT WE USE
 MAINS ELECTRICITY FOR LIGHTING,RADIO, 
 TV,REFIGERATION,COOKING AND LAUNDRY &amp; 
 MY DAD'S POWER TOOLS.  OUR NARROW     
 STREET LOSES SUNLIGHT AND CARS PARKED 
 ON BOTH SIDES HINDERS TRAFFIC. WE HAVE
 DOUBLE GLAZED WINDOWS TO KEEP US WARM 
 AND TO REDUCE STREET NOISE.  WE WATCH 
 TV A LOT AS A FAMILY.
