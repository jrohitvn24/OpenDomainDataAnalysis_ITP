		<content> P.C.Campion never knows what jobs he  
 might have to do each day, except for 
 those listed by Dines Green Station.He
 might get a call to go out to an      
 argument or a burglary.He might get a 
 call to go to an accident or to round 
 up straying animals.If he moves       
 animals off the road into a nearby    
 field he then has to find their owner.
 Sometimes he has to speak to parents  
 about children who have been          
 trespassing.                          
 P.C.Campion has been stationed at     
 Alfrick for 18 months.In September    
 1984 he started a youth club in the   
 village hall, because there were no   
 clubs or groups for the village       
 children.Some children from Suckley   
 also attend as there is no club in    
 their village.This club is run in his 
 off duty time,with the help of a few  
 other grown ups.                      </content>
