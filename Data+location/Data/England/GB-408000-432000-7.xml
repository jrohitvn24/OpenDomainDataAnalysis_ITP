		<content>  Our square was mainly rural and the  
 land was used for grazing stock       
 animals and haymaking.                
  The only amenities were a public     
 house and a motor engineering garage. 
  The only buildings were a few farms  
 and the occasional bungalow,but at    
 Egypt there was a row of old cottages.
  In conversation with a few of the    
 inhabitants we discovered that there  
 was no bus route and they had to pay  
 to hire a private school bus.They had 
 no postal conveniencies or any shops. 
 The nearest shops were about one      
 mile away.                            
  None of the houses were supplied with
 a main drainage system.It was a very  
 good local community and many of the  
 locals often went to the pub.They said
 that you needed transport to get      
 anywhere if you lived up there.
