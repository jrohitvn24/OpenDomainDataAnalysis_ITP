		<title>08Worsley Old Hall</title>
		<content> It was called Worsley Old Hall because
 there ws a Worsley New Hall just down 
 the road. The complete house was      
 finished in 1519. The shape of the    
 building was E shaped. Surrounding the
 house there is a large garden of six  
 acres. Separating the gardens from the
 fields is a special ditch called a Ha 
 Ha. Inside the hall some of the roof  
 beams were said to be old ship's      
 timbers. Many of the windows were very
 small, one of them dating from 1639.  
 Some of the rooms were wood panelled. 
 Two important families have lived in  
 the house. They were the Egertons and 
 the Bridgewaters. James Brindley      
 planned the Bridgewater Canal from the
 house. We went into the original      
 cellars which are a series of brick   
 arches. The man who took us round was 
 Mr Smith. He was dressed in a costume 
 dating from about 1630.               </content>
