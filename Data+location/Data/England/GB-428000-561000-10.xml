		<title>10A DAY ON THE DOLE</title>
		<content> HEBBURN                               
 After spending over twenty years      
 working in the shipyards,i am         
 now unemployed.My day to day          
 activities and lifestyle bear little  
 resemblance to when I was working.The 
 disciplined pattern of starting work  
 at 7.30 am and arriving home at 5.00  
 pm has changed dramatically.A typical 
 day now will ential getting up at 8.00
 am to ensure the children get to      
 school on time and my wife gets to    
 work.I will then attend to some of    
 the household chores such as washing  
 up, cleaning etc.Next a visit to the  
 newsagent and do any shopping that is 
 necessary. One of the dubious         
 advantages of being on the dole is    
 that you have more time to do things  
 like gardening, which i enjoy.        
 Asuming that it is Monday then I visit
 the Department of Employment,         </content>
