		<title>07Compton Church</title>
		<content> The church dates back to Norman times.
 It started to fall down and was       
 rebuilt in about 1850.It is built of  
 stone and flint and it has a          
 tower.Every Sunday there are services 
 and during the week there is a choir  
 practice and bell ringing .There is   
 quite a big graveyard with a lot of   
 graves.There is a tapestry with 5     
 scenes on it.Also there is a font     
 probably the same age as the church   
 with an ornamental lid.At the front of
 the church there is a big door with   
 huge hinges and a very big key.Behind 
 the door is a porch then there is     
 another big door with a smaller door  
 cut into it.This door has ornamental  
 carvings on it.The smaller door is    
 used more often than the big door.
