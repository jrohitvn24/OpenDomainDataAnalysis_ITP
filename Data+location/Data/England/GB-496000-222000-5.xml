		<content>  There is a gravestone in Tilsworth   
 churchyard (cf.{page 4}) of an unknown
 girl found in 1821 by a tree in       
 Blackgrove wood with her throat cut.  
 Her murderer was never found but he   
 was thought to be a Leighton Buzzard  
 man who confessed on his deathbed to  
 murdering his wife. It is purported   
 that human blood has welled up from   
 the foot of the tree or from a hole in
 the trunk ever since.                 
  There have been many reported        
 sightings of a ghost seen at night,   
 thumbing a lift along the Stanbridge  
 Road. When cars stop to pick him up,  
 after entering the vehicle he         
 disappears. This seems to be the ghost
 of a man killed recently whilst       
 walking along this road.
