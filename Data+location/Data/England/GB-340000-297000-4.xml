		<title>04PICKLESCOTT VILLAGE</title>
		<content>  {Picklescott}is a village just off   
 the{Longmynd}.It has got quite a lot  
 of friendly people living around      
 there.                                
   Picklescott is ten miles west of    
{Shrewsbury}.There are four farms      
 in Picklescott.There aren't any shops 
 and there are only about fourteen     
 houses there.There is a stream running
 through the village.                  
   I think Picklescott needs a lot more
 facilities-like buses and village     
 shops.The"Bottle and Glass" is the    
 only pub in Picklescott.The nearest   
{junior school}is in{Dorrington}which  
 is two miles away.The nearest         
{secondary school}is the Mary Webb at  
{Pontesbury.                           
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
