		<title>05Buying a House (continued)</title>
		<content> The steps to buying a house are:first 
 you choose a house you want to buy    
 then go to a Building Society  or     
 Bank to ask for a mortgage and then to
 a solicitor to ask ask him to begin   
 preparations on the legal work        
 involved.                             
 If the "chain" of people buying and   
 selling their houses is a long one    
 then there can be many problems along 
 the way to signing the final contract 
 which will mean the house you want is 
 yours.                                
 Very few people are able to buy a home
 for cash and the majority will have to
 borrow the money on mortgage and      
 gradually repay it perhaps over as    
 many as twenty or twenty five years.  
 Quite a few people in Immingham have  
 bought their Council house.
