		<content>    Pilsley Church of England (Aided)  
 School was built in 1849 and extended 
 and modernised in 1970.               
    It is stone built and has two      
 classrooms and a large hall used for  
 school meals, physical education,     
 television, and community meetings.   
    The two classes are from ages four 
 to seven and then seven to eleven     
 years. There are two full-time        
 teachers, one being the head, two     
 part-time staff and two welfare       
 assistants, one being the school      
 clerk.                                
    The meals are cooked in the        
 adjoining canteen and distributed by  
 the cook and meal time supervisor.    
    There are 38 children on roll, some
 who travel from surrounding areas.    
 Most are children of employees of     
 Chatsworth. The school is closely     
 linked with St.Peter's Church, Edensor</content>
