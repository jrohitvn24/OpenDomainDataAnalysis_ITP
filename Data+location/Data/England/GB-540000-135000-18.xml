		<title>18LIFE IN ASHURSTWOOD</title>
		<content>                                       
 There is a lack of facilities in Ash- 
 urstwood which makes life boring.You  
 can attend a youth-club held in the   
 village hall but it is only open once 
 a week.You can play tennis at John    
 Piers Field but you have to pay.You   
 can play football on "The Wreck" but  
 very few facilities exist for young   
 children.Occasionally a barn dance or 
 a disco is held in the village hall   
 and people of all ages attend.They are
 good for the community spirit.The     
 shops are fairly typical for a small  
 village.There are 2 grocers, a paper  
 shop, Post Office, a hat shop, and a  
 hardware store.The village is         
 surrounded by some beautiful country  
 walks.
