		<content> In our family there are five people:  
 Mum ,Dad,and the kids.Our names are   
 Ashley,Sarah,and Hannah.The day begins
 at approximately{7:45am}when we all   
 get up,dress and have breakfast.This  
 is a{light meal}consisting of either  
 toast or cereal with coffee,tea or    
 fruit juice.{Both my parents}work:my  
 mother teaches at a girl's school,and 
 my father works in the space-research 
 department in the University.Although 
 I have a brother and sister to play   
 with,I still like to occupy myself.To 
 do this I can watch T.V ,ride my bike,
 read books,listen to music,play tennis
 use the computer or play the piano or 
 my flute.My brother spends much of his
 time at the church,as he is a member  
 of the choir.My{mother cooks most of  
{the meals,}but if she is too busy my  
 father helps.We have a cat called     
 Henry, and he is very friendly.       </content>
