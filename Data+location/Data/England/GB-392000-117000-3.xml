		<title>03Gamekeeping &amp; Pheasantry ii</title>
		<content> The area{Mr. Weekes}is responsible for
 is east of the track running down from
{Berwick St John}to{Tollard Royal}. One
 of the problems is that the chemicals 
 sprayed on the weeds kill many of the 
 insects that the pheasants eat. Sheep 
 and deer are also a problem as they   
 eat the grain put out for the birds.  
    He has to put out{snares}to catch  
 the{foxes}and in the air,{magpies and 
{rooks}attack the young birds. Of all  
 the predators the{fox}is the most     
 dangerous.                            
 He rents his pheasantry from the{Pitt-
{Rivers Estate}and he organises several
 shoots a year for a{Bournemouth}shoot-
 ing syndicate.                        
 He says it is a very interesting way  
 of earning a living but there is not  
 much profit in it.
