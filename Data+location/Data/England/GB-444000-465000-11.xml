		<content> At this time no deeds for the building
 could be traced and after 12 years new
 ones were prepared.  In 1963 it was   
 handed over to a Board of Trustees but
 is now run by a Committee, members    
 representing the organisations in the 
 village.  They run various social     
 events, dances, games evenings and    
 jumble sales, to raise money for      
 repairs and running costs and have    
 recently spent over Â£2000 on damp     
 proofing and exterior rendering.  It  
 is used by the Women's Institute and  
 the Chapel and can be hired for       
 private functions.  There is a        
 separate building housing 2 toilets &amp; 
 wash basins and the main hall has a   
 small kitchen attached.
