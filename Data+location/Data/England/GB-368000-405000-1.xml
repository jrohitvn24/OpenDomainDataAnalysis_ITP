		<title>01Bolton S.W. A Brief Review</title>
		<content> This is an area of diverse character- 
 ranging from farms and pastureland    
 interspersed with pockets of suburban 
 housing in the S.and W.at{Over Hulton 
 and part of{Deane}- to a busy, densely
 populated area of shops, industry and 
 terraced houses, relics of the        
 Industrial Revolution, in the N.E.    
 at{Daubhill}and{Great Lever}(this area
 is subject to urban renewal as old and
 unfit houses and industrial premises  
 are demolished and sites are cleared  
 to provide new housing areas).        
 The S.E. corner of the map belongs to 
 the N.W.(Highfield) area of{Farnworth.
 Until the l950's this was farmland.   
 Since then, the 6 farms which occupied
 the land have been replaced by        
 extensive housing development. The    
 area between Great Lever and Farnworth
 is occupied by hospital buildings,    
 farmland, and part of the golf course.</content>
