		<title>17MY HOBBIES</title>
		<content> My favourite hobby is riding &amp; there's
 a small riding school down my road. I 
 go &amp; help there nearly every day.     
 Just on the outskirts of our village  
 is Highfields Holiday Camp with a     
 swimming pool.They let us go in to    
 swim but you need a pass with a photo 
 on it.                                
 We have a Youth Club once a week, a   
 disco &amp; a Games evening every other   
 Friday.                               
 In my spare time I go cycling down the
 roads around Little Clacton with my   
 friends or go out along the footpaths 
 across the fields. I don't have far   
 to walk to get to school either.      
 With all the summer traffic, I think  
 it will be a good job when the bypass 
 comes because our ponies won't be so  
 bothered or frightened by the noise.  
 It will be quieter too for the elderly
 &amp; safer for the children.             </content>
