		<content> The main attraction in Mayfair is Bond
 Street which has many tourists making 
 it quite a busy place. The majority of
 land is owned by the Duke of          
 Westminster and the British Petroleum 
 Pension Fund Trust. Houses, which are 
 quite expensive, range from 200,000 to
 2,500,000 pounds.  There are three    
 quite famous squares called Berkeley, 
 Grosvenor and Hanover Squares and a   
 market called Shepherd Market.        
 Somewhere between two and three       
 thousand people live in Mayfair       
 permanently and there are several     
 hotels; the most famous being         
 Claridge's, the Hilton, The Connaught,
 the Dorchester and Grosvenor House.   
 Mayfair also contains a lot of        
 foreign embassies, the largest of them
 being the American Embassy, located in
 Grosvenor Square.
