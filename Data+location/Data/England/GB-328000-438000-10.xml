		<content>{Warbreck Service Reservoir}           
 This was built in 1924 and 1929 for   
 the Fylde Water Board. It is          
 rectangular in plan, divided into two 
 equal parts.The walls , roof and      
 columns are made of concrete.         
   These reservoirs hold treated water 
 which can be supplied from several    
 sources. These include Barnacre Water 
 Treatment works, which treats fell    
 water and Franklin Water Treatment    
 works at Catterall, which treats river
 and borehole water.                   
 When the Tower was built in 1931, an  
 electrically driven centrifugal pump  
 was installed to deliver water to the 
 tank; it is capable of delivering     
 25000 gallons of water every 24       
 hours.Two years later, a second pump  
 of the same size was installed.
