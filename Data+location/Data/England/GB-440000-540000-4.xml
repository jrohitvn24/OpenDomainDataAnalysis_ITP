		<content> Up until the 1900's, this was a very  
 rural area. In 1821 the parish of     
{Easington}contained 211 houses and    
 1,112 people. In the time of Henry I, 
{Ralph Flambard, Bishop of Durham,     
 granted the manor of{Horden}to his    
 nephew{Richard Fitzmarmaduke.         
{Horden Hall,}which is a farmhouse, is 
 one of the few historic buildings in  
 this area.It was the manor house and  
 dates from the time of Queen Elizabeth
 I. The shield of arms above the door  
 tells us that it was at that time the 
 property of{Christopher Conyers Esq., 
 and was probably built by him.        
 In 1767 it became the property of     
{Rowland Burdon Esq.}and remained with 
 his family until recent years, when it
 became the property of the{National   
{Coal Board.                           
 The coming of the coal_ mines in 1900 
 changed the countryside.              </content>
