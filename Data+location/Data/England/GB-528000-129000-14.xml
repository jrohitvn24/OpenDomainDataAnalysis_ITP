            {(MACHINERY)   }           
 On farms it is important to have      
 machinery.There is all kinds of       
 machinery you can choose from.There   
 are diggers,loaders,tractors and      
 combine harvesters.{Diggers}are not   
 usually used on farms but on road     
 repair although they may be hired or  
 even bought to install gas pipes or   
 something like that.{Loaders}are      
 things that are used to load up hay   
 bales in a shed for the cows to eat in
 the winter.It has an arm (sometimes   
 extending) onto which you can fit     
 either a shovel bucket,a fork lift or 
 a bale lift.The cab is on the right of
 the vehicle with the arm in the       
 middle.It can also be used to clear up
 the farm yard with the shovel         
 bucket.The cab is well protected.The  
 rest of the machinery is on next page.</content>
