		<title>13PORTHOLME</title>
		<content> Portholme meadow covers 247 acres and 
 is probably the largest of its kind in
 the country.The name means 'an island 
 where the river meets the road.'      
 Today the meadow is noted for its{wild
{flowers,}some of which are{quite rare.
 To be given its proper title Portholme
 is an{enclosed common.}This in itself 
 is a contradiction.It is one of only  
 two in the country to be defined thus.
 Originally the meadow was owned by the
 Lord of the Manor.                    
 Now it is owned by the parishes       
 of Brampton,Huntingdon and            
 Godmanchester. The villagers of these 
 places have the right to graze animals
 on the eddage. Some of the farmers in 
 the area also have the right to cut   
 the hay on the meadow.Although it is  
 common land people must stick to the  
 footpaths, of which there are three,  
 connecting the parishes concerned.    </content>
