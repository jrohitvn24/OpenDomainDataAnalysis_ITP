		<content> In 1985 there are{28,000}people in    
{10,000}dwellings. There is a variety  
 of housing, both private and council. 
 Near the centre of the town, old      
 terraced properties are still         
 standing, dating back to the 19th c.  
 and earlier.  Improvements have been  
 made to some houses through council   
 and subsidence grants. The Council has
 carried out slum clearance in the     
 north and south of the town, replacing
 it with houses and old people's       
 accomodation. Old people are well     
 cared for with Warden-Aided bungalows 
 and flats plus an old people's home.  
 There are large post-war estates of   
 semi-detached council houses, some    
 having been modernised, some now owner
 occupied. New private building,       
 infill continues to the west of the   
 town.
