		<title>04SHELTON WATER WORKS.</title>
		<content> Shelton Water Works has been in       
 operation since 1935 and was enlarged 
 in 1971 due to increased demand. It   
 supplis water to all of the Borough of
 Shrewsbury and to the villages along  
 the A49 to just beyond Church         
 Stretton.                             
   The water is pumped from the intake 
 in the River Severn to settling tanks 
 where chemicals are added to aid the  
 first cleansing. It then passes       
 through rapid gravity filters to      
 remove any remaining dirt or grit.    
 Samples are tested at each stage.     
   Shelton Water Works has a storage   
 capacity of 4\ million gallons in a   
 clean water reservoir. From here, the 
 water gravitates to the high lift     
 pumping station and is then pumped    
 into supply using the water tower as a
 balancing tank. Shrewsbury people use 
 5 million gallons of water each day.  </content>
