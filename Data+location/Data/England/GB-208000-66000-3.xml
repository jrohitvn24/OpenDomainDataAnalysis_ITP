		<title>03Kingswood Farm _ Cardinham</title>
		<content> MR and MRS Dyer and their son work on 
 the farm. They also have 2 men to help
 them.The farm has 402 acres. This is a
 very big farm most farms in Cardinham 
 are much smaller than this. The farm  
 was mentoined in the original Domesday
 book and was farmed in strips by many 
 farmers. The highest part of the farm 
 is over 600' above sea level.         
  Most of the land is used as pasture. 
 60 acres are used for growing barley  
 and 20 for growing fodder beet and    
 turnips. All of this is grown to feed 
 the animals during the winter. About  
 100 acres are used to make silage and 
 hay,also for feeding to the animals in
 the winter. There is also about 18    
 acres of oak coppice next to the      
 forrestry land.
