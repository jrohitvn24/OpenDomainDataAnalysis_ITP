		<title>01Overview of block 04040279</title>
		<content>This block is in the southern suburbs  
of Birmingham, 6km from the centre, not
far from the boundary. Two radial roads
cross it: Pershore Road connecting the 
city with{Kings Norton}and Alcester Rd.
with{Kings Heath}. Mainly residential, 
the area's older houses date from the  
late 19th century, followed by inter-  
war semi detached and modern estates.  
Most distinctive are the houses of the 
{Bournville Trust} developed when      
{Cadbury's} chocolate factory was      
moved from the centre to a healthier   
environment. Cadbury's and the factory 
centre in {Kings Norton}are the only   
significant industrial sites. The      
northern part of the area is heavily   
built-up with some parks in {Kings     
Heath}and{Stirchley}. There is more    
open space and a lower housing density 
in{Bournville}and{Kings Norton}.
