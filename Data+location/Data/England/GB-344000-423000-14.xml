		<content>  A contractor comes with his combine  
harvester to harvest our barley.This   
usually takes half a day. The combine  
puts the corn into large trailers      
and the straw and chaff are thrown back
onto the ground. The straw is later    
baled to be used for anilmal bedding.  
  Our barley is sent to Marsden's corn 
mill in Midge Hall where it is made    
into animal food. Our land is then     
ploughed and left to rest over winter. 
  We also plant our potatoes in Spring.
(Earlies in March, Main Crop in April.)
After ploughing and cultivating the    
land chemical and manure fertilisers   
are applied. The soil is cut into rows 
with a special machine. A helicopter   
comes four times during the Summer to  
spray the potatoes to stop them getting
blight and also to help produce a large
crop.(Contd.)
