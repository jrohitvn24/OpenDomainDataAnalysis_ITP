		<content> The{River Ouse}is a tidal river.      
 The River Ouse today affects the life 
 of the villages very little. It is a  
 barrier rather than a water           
 highway.However numerous cargo boats  
 carry goods to the Flour Mills and    
 Animal Food Mills at Selby and        
 Barlby.The River is bridged at Goole  
 and at Selby where the notorious Toll 
 Bridge gives precedence to river      
 traffic and consequential delays to   
 road users.                           
 Pleasure craft use the river          
 particularly in the summer months and 
 many small boats use the river to     
 visit the pictuesque city of York.    
 Beside the Ouse at Newhay is situated 
{"Newhay Fisheries".}A flood of the    
 Ouse left land under water. The       
 residue made excellent carp ponds. The
 table carp reared here are sold       
 throughout the country.               </content>
