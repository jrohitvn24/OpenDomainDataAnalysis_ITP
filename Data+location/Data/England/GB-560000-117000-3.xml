		<content>   The population of approximately 400 
 people is sprinkled over the area with
 a higher density at Rushlake Green    
 (RG) and Turner's Green. In those     
 areas the number of people living     
 alone,mainly elderly,is significantly 
 higher. In RG there are no children   
 under 5 and only 4 under l7, whereas  
 just outside the village there are    
 higher numbers of children. This      
 reflects the higher price of central  
 RG properties. The majority of        
 families are first generation in the  
 area although some 20% go back more   
 than 3 generations in East Sussex.It  
 is interesting to note that there are 
 only 2 council owned properties and 9 
 out of l0 homes have a telephone. Even
 the most outlying houses have power   
 and water but there are no gas lines  
 and Calor gas provides an alternative.
