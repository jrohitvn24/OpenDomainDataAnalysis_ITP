		<content>  Today  Karen, Shaun, Sarah and       
 Kerry went down to Mr.Rowans antique  
 shop.                                 
 First he  showed us a mahogany table. 
 It was made in 1780 and the price was 
 Â£5oo. Then he showed us what we       
 thought was a Grandfather clock but   
 its real name is a long case clock and
 it was made in 1795.                  
                       We also saw a   
  tea bowl and saucer which was        
 Chinese.                              
         He also said that it was all  
 hand painted.                         
              Then he  showed us a     
 silver spoon. Then he showed us  a    
 snuff  box.                           
         There is only one antique     
 shop in Blockley.                     
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
