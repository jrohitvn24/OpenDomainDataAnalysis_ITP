		<title>16Guide celebrations in Dalton</title>
		<content> In 1985 the girl guides are           
 celebrating the 75th.anniversary of   
 their formation.There has been many   
 celebrations for the guides and       
 brownies.Lady Baden Powell founded the
 guides in 1910.All the guides and     
 brownies were given a 75 year badge to
 sew on their uniforn at the beginning 
 of the year.One of the most inportant 
 celebrations was when the guides and  
 brownies of South Cumbria went to     
 Levens Hall to collect a birthday     
 candle.The candle we saw was          
 originally lit at Buckingham Palace by
 Princess Margaret and distributed to  
 regional commissioners from all  parts
 of the country.The regional commission
 travelled all over the north west of  
 England and passed on the candle to   
 the various commissioners at Levens   
 Hall as well as at other venues.
