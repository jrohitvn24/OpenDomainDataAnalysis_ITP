		<title>04All About Potters Bar</title>
		<content> I like Potters Bar because it has     
 got lots of sports things. There is a 
 swimming pool which is having a new   
 weight training room built and it     
 already has squash courts and some    
 tennis courts.I sometimes go to the   
 swimming pool for lessons. I also like
 the big field because it is very good 
 for football and cricket.I like our   
 neighbourhood because it is within    
 walking distance from our school. I   
 like our school because all my friends
 go. I also think the woods are very   
 nice because there is a lot of nature 
 and it is nice to go there on a bike.
