		<title>01GENERAL SUMMARY</title>
		<content> The area is very rural,lying about 3  
 miles NE of Carlisle and having really
 only 3 settlements of any size.These  
 are the villages of HOUGHTON,LINSTOCK 
 and BRUNSTOCK.The countryside is good 
 farmland,mostly pasture or grazing    
 land and supporting a number of quite 
 large dairy farms.                    
   In our area the largest farm        
 (Linstock) is about 1100 acres but    
 others are 5_600 acres.Most animals   
 are bought and sold in nearby         
 Carlisle,an important market town and 
 agricultural centre.                  
 Industry other than farming is        
 minimal,but some tourists come looking
 for the route of Hadrians Wall which  
 crosses the area.The M6 motorway      
 slices through the area and the R.Eden
 meanders across one corner.This quiet 
 rural area has few amenities but is   
 unspoilt and even deer roam freely.   </content>
