		<content> My name is Chris Timons.I live at the 
 Cottage,Upper Langwith,where I was    
 born almost 11years ago.I enjoy       
 meeting my friends,Glen               
 McBroom,Richard Thomson and Sean      
 Harris,who come to my home after      
 school.We often go for walks to Guildy
 Wells or the Mill Dam where we amuse  
 ourselves throwing stones into the    
 stream and splashing each other.We've 
 all got the same types of sports      
 bicycles on which we go riding around 
 the village,Langwith,Shirebrook and   
 on to the Comprehensive School        
 field,which is the favourite because  
 it has hills and humps,spills and     
 jumps.At other times we enjoy         
 ourselves climbing the fruit trees in 
 our orchard,playing cricket and       
 football,or tennis when we find the   
 racquets and balls.
