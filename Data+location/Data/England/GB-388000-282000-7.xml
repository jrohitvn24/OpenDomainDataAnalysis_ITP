		<title>07STOURBRIDGE TRANSPORT</title>
		<content>  The residents of Stourbridge are the 
 proud owners of the shortest public   
  ailway track in the whole of         
 Britain.it is known as the            
 "Shuttle"and runs for an average time 
 of 3mins. 7secs.The track lies between
 Stourbridge Town Centre and the       
 railway station,Stourbridge Junction. 
  The bus service has been in          
 existence since 1663,the days of the  
 horseless carriage.Today the buses are
 more smoothly run, but there are      
 occasional adventures as one          
 interviewed driver recalls.He tells   
 the story of a baby who was born on   
 his bus!                              
  Stourbridge has a controversial ring 
 road system.It had it's critics when  
 it opened at 2 am.on the 13/11/68,and 
 still has today.A 1985 survey shows   
 that over 50%think it a "death trap."
