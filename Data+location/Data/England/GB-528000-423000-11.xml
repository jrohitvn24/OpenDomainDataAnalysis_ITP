		<content>{SCHOOL HOUSE AT WINESTEAD}            
 The school house built originally as a
 "Dame School" with one room upstairs  
 and one room downstairs was later     
 extended to be used solely for housing
 the Head Teacher when Winestead School
 was built next door.  Eventually the  
 school closed as did many  smaller    
 local schools and all children were   
 sent to the school at Patrington.     
 The school house, standing in 1/3 acre
 of ground was purchased in 1984 by the
 present owner who had retired as      
 Headmaster from Patrington School.    
 Extensive alterations internally and  
 additions externally were made        
 although the character of the house   
 remained unchanged.  When renovating  
 the dining room (which was the        
 original downstairs room in the "Dames
 School") 4 chimneys were discovered,  
 each behind the other also 4 ceilings.</content>
