 school visited{Heeley Community       
{Mosque.}In it is a praying hall, a    
 youth centre and an Islamic school for
 girls. Before they could enter they   
 had to take their shoes off because it
 was a holy place. The Qur'an is the   
 holy book of the{Muslims.}They believe
 it contains the words of God. There   
 was a prayer mat on the floor facing  
 the{Kaba}in{Mecca.}On the day of the  
 visit it was the first day of{Ramadan.
 Some people had been up at 3.30 a.m.  
 for prayers.                          
 In{Lowfield}school about a third of   
 the pupils have parents of Pakistani  
 origin. The school celebrates both    
 Christian and Muslim festivals. They  
 have recently celebrated{Eid-al-fitr  
 with a display of Muslim art,         
 ceremonial dress and prayer mats and  
 an Asian meal for school dinner.      </content>
