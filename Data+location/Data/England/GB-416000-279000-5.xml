		<content> ST.CATHERINES CHURCH, C DE B          
   The village church of Catherine de  
 Barnes, situated in the old school    
 building, Hampton Lane, is under      
 threat of closure. The small village  
 community who use the school hall as a
 place of worship, are worried that the
 Parochial Council will no longer be   
 able to support the small congregation
 financially. The villagers agree that 
 most of them could travel to another  
 church but St. Catherines is more than
 a church. The Hall is the centre of   
 village social life with many clubs   
 and socities using its facilities.    
   A village Association is to be      
 formed to organise events and maintain
 the Hall by renting it out.This they  
 hope will finance the church building.
 The congregation would be left with   
 the task of paying their share of     
 normal Parish expenses.               </content>
