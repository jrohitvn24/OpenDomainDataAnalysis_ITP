		<title>12A Headmaster Talks.</title>
		<content>  Severn Vale Secondary Modern School  
 was opened in Quedgeley in 1961. In   
 1985 it had 490 children, of whom     
 about 70 live in Quedgeley. Others    
 travel from as far away as Arlingham. 
 There are 27 teachers.                
  Mr. Lutkins, headmaster since 1973,  
 finds the children in his charge very 
 friendly. The most important lesson   
 that the children should learn, he    
 believes, is to care for other people.
 One of the most pleasing things to    
 have happened at the school recently  
 is the way pupils have looked after a 
 badly physically handicapped boy.     
  Mr. Lutkins recalls going into       
 assembly one day, and finding all the 
 children facing the wrong way.        
 Realising that it was April 1st, he   
 successfully managed to persuade many 
 children to look up at the ceiling    
 where, he claimed, hung an elephant.  </content>
