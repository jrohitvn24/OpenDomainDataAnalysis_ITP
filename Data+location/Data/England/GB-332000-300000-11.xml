		<content>HOPE SHOW                              
This is an annual show in August,a big 
undertaking for such a small scattered 
community.It has run for 4years and in 
1983 attracted a record 2,000          
attendance.                            
The show has a full range of           
craft,cookery and horticultural        
competititions and field events such as
dog,goat and ferret shows.There are    
childrens rides,sideshows and arena    
events such as theatre groups, country 
dancing and brass bands.It is held in  
the village hall and adjoining field.  
The show is run as an entertainment not
a money raising venture, though the    
show does give the opportunity to local
charities and voluntary groups to have 
stalls which boost funds for the       
church,youth clubs etc.A five a side   
fooball competition and clay pigeon    
shoot take place on the same day.      </content>
