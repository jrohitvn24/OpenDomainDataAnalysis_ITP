		<content> There are several areas of forest and 
 woodland within the block: Aller Wood 
 in the S.W. corner, Turn Hill and Beer
 Wood in the N. and Blackham Wood to   
 the N.E. are all woods dominated by   
 deciduous trees. Breach Wood, to the  
 S.W. is mainly coniferous. Children   
 from High Ham Primary School surveyed 
 8 random areas of forest and woodland.
 10 types of tree were found in the    
 sample areas. Ash, field maple and    
 hawthorn trees predominate. There are 
 also a number of hazel, elderberry,   
 sycamore and beech. Oak, sloe and     
 rowan trees are found individually    
 within wooded areas.Turn Hill, to the 
 N.W., National Trust land, also has   
 several ornamental trees e.g. apple   
 and laburnam. Breach Wood at Bowdens, 
 to the S.W., is an area of cultivated 
 forest. It is a coniferous forest     
 covering approximately 100 hectares.  </content>
