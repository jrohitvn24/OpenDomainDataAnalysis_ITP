		<title>14Nomansland Common,Sandridge</title>
		<content> Nomansland Common was formed          
 originally by a very large glacier    
 during the Ice Age.In Medieval times  
 there were disputes between the       
 Abbey of St.Albans and Westminster.   
 They both said that the land was      
 theirs and wanted to use it.If they   
 could hang a body on a gibbet for 24  
 hours without anyone taking it        
 down,they were entitled to claim the  
 land.The trouble passed when they     
 agreed to share it.Later the land was 
 used for grazing which kept the trees 
 and shrubs down.In the past it was the
 haunt of highwaymen.It was later  used
 for various sports.At times it has    
 been used for prizefighting,a         
 racecourse and cricket.Cricket is     
 still played there.At the weekend     
 people come to fly kites and          
 model planes.Part of the common has   
 been cleared especially for this.     </content>
