		<content> P.C.Tutton is a Beat Officer who came 
 to tell us about the Community Police.
 Beat officers use a car or walk around
 in their jobs.His code number is 1272.
 His code stands for Chelmsford        
 Division.As our Community Policeman he
 comes to our school to tell us about  
 the Green Cross Code and he shows us  
 films about never going with          
 strangers.His 4 major tasks are to    
 save lives and property,to keep the   
 Queen's Peace and to take people to   
 court. P.C.Tutton has a truncheon made
 of solid oak.It is very heavy and very
 dangerous.He uses it to break windows 
 in car crashes but he has never used  
 it as a weapon.A police officer must  
 carry his truncheon at all times.If   
 someone gets knocked over and they    
 have stopped breathing, he will have  
 to give them the kiss of life.
