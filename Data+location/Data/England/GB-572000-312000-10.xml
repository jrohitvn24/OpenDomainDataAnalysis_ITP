		<title>10LANDSCAPE Pentney &amp; Narboro'</title>
		<content> The approach to Narborough from King's
 Lynn passes through an area of{mixed  
{woodland}concealing the sovereign     
{lakes,}formed by peat cuttings and fed
 by the{river Nar.}                    
                                       
 The main residential area of the      
 village is to the south of the main   
 road. The{landscape is slightly       
{undulating}and the large{belts of     
{trees}planted to form{windbreaks}are a
 very prominent feature. Bare fields   
 are seen to be prodigiously covered   
 with{flints.                          
                                       
 Pentney is a less populous village    
 well{spread out}on minor roads to the 
 west of Narborough. The{landscape is  
{flat}without the planted windbreaks.  
 Features of the village are the       
 church, and the former school and     
 station are both now dwellings.       </content>
