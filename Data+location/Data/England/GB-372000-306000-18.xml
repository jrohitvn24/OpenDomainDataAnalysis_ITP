		<content>   One study on air led to the making  
 of tissue paper hot air balloons which
 travelled several miles with cotton   
 wool and methylated spirit propulsion.
 This was followed by a helium balloon 
 race .                                
   One balloon was found by a teacher  
 from a small village school in        
 Linconshire ,and now there is a       
 twinning between the two schools.     
   The upper juniors play a variety of 
 instruments including clarinet and    
 violin,and there is a small brass     
 band. They play netball, cricket      
 rounders and football against other   
 schools in the area,and there are     
 swimming competitions.
