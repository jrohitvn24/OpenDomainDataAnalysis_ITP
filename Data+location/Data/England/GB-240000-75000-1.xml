		<content> The area is rural, with good soil. The
 land is convoluted into 'combes', and 
 is wooded with both deciduous and     
 coniferous copses.                    
 Population is sparse, the majority    
 based in agricultural pursuits, with  
 some commuting to the nearby towns.   
 Public services are minimal.          
 The water table flows southwest       
 towards the River Tamar, and there are
 many natural springs.There are several
 disused mines which are monuments to a
 brief period of wealth.               
 Most of the dwellings are built from  
 locally quarried stone. The quarries  
 are now defunct.                      
 People are for the main, locals, and  
 are friendly though reticent with     
 strangers, and treat surveys such as  
 this with suspicion.
