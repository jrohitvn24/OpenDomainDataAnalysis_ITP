		<title>20Newspapers in Banbury</title>
		<content>  As well as all the usual daily       
newspapers, there are three local      
weekly newspapers in Banbury.          
  There are two free newspapers which  
are delivered to every house on        
Wednesday or Thursday. These are the   
Banbury Cake and the Banbury Focus.    
  The one you have to pay for is the   
Banbury Guardian. It usually has about 
48 pages, half of them adverts, and it 
costs 16p.                             
                                       
  Both of the schools which have       
written these twenty pages for the     
Domesday Project have produced their   
own school newspapers just for the     
children in the school to read.        
  The schools are Queensway and        
Dashwood. They are both primary schools
and children in the upper junior       
classes worked with their teachers on  
this project in Summer 1985.           </content>
