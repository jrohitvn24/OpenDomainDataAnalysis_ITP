		<title>12HOUSES IN THORPE</title>
		<content>{Ebenizer}is the oldest house and one  
 of the most historic buildings in     
 Thorpe-on-the-Hill.                   
 It was built in 1843 and in it's      
 earlier days it was used as a general 
 store although it has now been        
 converted to a house.                 
 Most of the other houses in Thorpe    
 look like expensive properties and    
 many are for old and retired people.  
 Another house converted from something
 else is the{Old Mill.}Originally this 
 was a mill but as it is not now used  
 it has been converted to a house.
