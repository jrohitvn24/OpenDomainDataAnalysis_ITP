		<content> Children enjoy a variety of both trad-
 itional and  modern games  at playtime
 in school.  Many boys  and  some girls
 prefer{football. }Other games include:
{Train Catch: }one child is catcher and
 counts to 20 then gives chase.  Anyone
 caught  joins on to form a 'train' and
 the last caught  is catcher next time.
{Stick in the Mud: }a catch  game where
 anyone caught  stands still  with legs
 apart but  is freed if  another player
 goes through them.  The catcher  tries
 to make all others 'stick in the mud'.
{Skipping is}popular; one rhyme goes :-
{"Bumper-car, bumper-car, No.27, Racing
{round the corner with a crash, bang,  
{wallop, Please put on your brakes."   
{Hopscotch }needs a grid chalked on the
 playground.  Players hop  from one end
 to  the  other  and  back, pushing  or
 throwing a small pebble as they go.
