		<content>Harborne is three miles from Birmingham
City Centre &amp; straddles the outer      
circle bus route. The High St.is a     
moderately large shopping centre with a
full range of shops, banks, building   
societies &amp; restaurants.               
Housing ranges from the very expensive 
detached houses to terraces, many of   
which have been renovated &amp; modernised 
in the private sector. Council houses  
are built in estates with some tower   
blocks.                                
To the S.W. of Harborne is Woodgate    
Valley Country Park, a large open area 
designated a park in 1984, which is    
flanked to the north by the large mixed
housing estate of Quinton &amp; to the     
south by the newer development of      
Woodgate Valley. The large pre-war     
housing estate of Weoley Castle lies to
the S.E. of the park &amp; is flanked by   
Lodge Hill Crematorium.                </content>
