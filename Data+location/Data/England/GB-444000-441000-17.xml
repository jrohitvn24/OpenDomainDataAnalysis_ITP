		<title>17The Tadcaster Carnival</title>
		<content> The main{event}of the year is the     
 Tadcaster Carnival which in 1985 was  
 held on the 29th June. A{carnival}    
 queen was elected and this year it was
 Jeanette Adey. There were floats and  
 little children dressed in funny{     
{costumes.}There was plenty of beer and
 other drinks and the food included    
 sandwiches, beefburgers, hot dogs and 
 crisps. There were games to spend your
 money on with always a chance of      
 winning it back. There was a haunted  
 castle for the{children.}Inside it was
 very dark, but lights kept flashing   
 near some bars behind which there were
 some scarey faces. In the evening a   
 disco was held for the young people at
 the Youth Club which also had a tuck  
 shop and games room open.
