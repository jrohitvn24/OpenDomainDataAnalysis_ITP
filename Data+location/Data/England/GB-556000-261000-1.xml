		<content> The area is mostly of a farming       
 narure. he ground is undulating. It is
 mostly arable. In the north west      
 corner is the village. In the south   
 east corner is the Beacon house and   
 Round house. As you approach the      
 village trees make their appearance   
 and gradually the houses start to     
 emerge. The Devils Dyke is at the     
 north east corner. At the south west  
 corner is Swaffam Bulbeck. The farms  
 are mostly along Heath Road, Swaffam  
 Prior. The others are between this    
 road and Heath Road, Swaffam Bulbeck. 
 Middle Hill is a hill between the two 
 roads which reaches up to 125 feet    
 above sea level. This is two feet off 
 the highest level in the area. It is a
 quite chalky area.
