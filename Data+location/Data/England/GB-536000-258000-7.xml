		<content> In school you can get jobs as teachers
 secretaries and dinner ladies and     
 kitchen staff.There are lots of       
 farming jobs from crop spraying to    
 general agriculture.In clubs you can  
 get a job as an assistant or organiser
 like in brownies or cubs.Churches need
 flower arrangers and cleaners.Pubs    
 have jobs like bar tenders,stock      
 keepers and assistant managers or     
 caretakers.The cafes need cashiers,   
 caretakers,cooks and managers.The     
 garage has mechanics.Shops need       
 assistants.There is not much          
 opportunity for work in the block,so  
 most people have to leave the Hardwick
 and surrounding area to find work.They
 usually go to Cambridge.The population
 has increased recently in Hardwick so 
 there are some extra jobs coming into 
 Hardwick.
