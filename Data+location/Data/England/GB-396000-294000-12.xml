		<title>12Wood Green Road.</title>
		<content>  In this square there are lots of     
 houses and roads. The main road is    
{Wood Green Road}and it is a very busy 
 road which carries traffic to and from
 the motorway.                         
  Next to the Wood Green Road is       
{Brunswick Park.}This is a large       
 playing area with a paddling          
 pool, football pitches, crazy golf    
 course, tennis courts and a bowling   
 green. Some of the problems in the    
 park are caused by people letting dogs
 off their leads, the paintwork on the 
 playground equipment is crumbling, the
 park keeper is not always there and   
 because of that people fight and      
 deface the buildings within the park. 
  Over the other side of the park is a 
{railway}which carries goods from here 
 to other parts of the country. The    
 railway is not used by passengers.
