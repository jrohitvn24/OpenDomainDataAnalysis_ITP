		<content>    I have a canal boat we use it every
 week-end and go to the local pub.Every
 school holiday we go on a holiday and 
 most times it means going down the    
 Hatton twenty one flight of locks.Our 
 boat is forty three feet long it has a
 Perkins diesel engine.My cabin is near
 the front of the boat it has          
 bunk-bed,a wardrobe and a desk.My     
 sister and I used to share a cabin but
 she doesn't come anymore so the cabin 
 is mine.The very front cabin used to  
 be the dogs cabin but one died so the 
 other sleeps with my Mum and Dad.Their
 cabin is behind mine,it is nearly the 
 same as mine but has two wardrobes and
 a smaller desk.Next there is the      
 galley.It has a sink and then on the  
 other side there is a lavatory and two
 cupboards.Then there is our           
 woodburning stove and a long seat.On  
 the other side there is a worksurface.</content>
