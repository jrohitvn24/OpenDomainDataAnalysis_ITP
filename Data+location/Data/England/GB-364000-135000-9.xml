		<title>09 SPARGROVE MANOR NR.BRUTON</title>
		<content>   Spargrove Manor lies to the north-  
west of Bruton and is one of the more  
interesting places to visit in the     
area.The village of Spargrove has more 
or less disappeared now,declining over 
the centuries.So has the original      
manor,but the one that still stands    
today dates from the early 18th        
century.It is set in a very rural      
location.                              
   The manor is deserted and has been  
for several decades.Geraniums grow in  
and around the window frames and the   
whole place is overgrown.Seen in the   
early evening,in the still quiet of    
the countryside,a very spooky          
atmosphere envelops one.It is said     
that the manor is haunted and that     
comes as no surprise.Nearby is an      
old mill,inhabited but no longer       
in working order.A serene setting,     
Spargrove Manor seems almost unreal.   </content>
