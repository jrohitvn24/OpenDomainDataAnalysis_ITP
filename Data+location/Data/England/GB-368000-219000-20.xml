		<title>20Clubs in Longhope</title>
		<content> One of the best supported clubs in {  
{Longhope}is the{Evergreens}.It exists 
 for those over 60 and meets in the    
 village hall. Many activities are     
 organised and the members have enjoyed
 visiting speakers,demonstrations and  
 during the Summer months outings on a 
 regular basis. We have visited the{   
{Evergreens}to sing and do some country
 dancing. Many of the people have grown
 up in the area ,attending the village 
 schools and they have told us many    
 stories of the past. They meet on a   
 Tuesday afternoon and in the morning  
 the Playgroup meets so with both old  
 and young catered for the life of the 
 village area seems set to continue.
