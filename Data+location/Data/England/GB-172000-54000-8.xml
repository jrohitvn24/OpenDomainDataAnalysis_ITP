		<title>08RECREATION _BOATING</title>
		<content> On Saturday July 6th 1985 my family   
 and I went on our boat to sleep.My    
 gran looked after Echo,who is my dog. 
 We sailed our boat "Bizzizzi",to      
 Falmouth Docks.Here outlined is the   
 route we took_leaving Pandora Inn,    
 down the Carrick Roads,past St. Mawes 
 and on into Falmouth.We then did a    
 return journey_altogether this took   
 one and a half hours.Our boat is a    
 Venturer with a blue strip around it. 
 We eventually arrived home at 10 in   
 the evening on that Sunday.Boating is 
 great fun.I have been on a canal      
 boating holiday in Wales,but I prefer 
 our boat."Bizzizzi"is 22 feet long,   
 has one mast and four berths.There    
 is a boating lake in Perranporth but  
 it is only for rowing boats.
