		<title>14Brackley &amp; Evenley housing</title>
		<content>   We talked to an estate agent in the 
town about housing in our area.        
   On the whole she dealt with more    
houses in the village of Evenley than  
in Brackley and the former are         
generally more expensive than the      
latter. That is to say that the same   
sized house would cost more in Evenley 
than in Brackley (see "Brackley Estate 
Agent" - page 13).                     
   The oldest house in Evenly is called
"The Manor House" and it dates from the
sixteenth century. The oldest house in 
Brackley is to be found on Buckingham  
Road. It is one of Brackley's four     
thatched houses.                       
   Not many houses were built in       
Brackley between 1900 and 1960. This is
because there was hardly any new       
industry appearing at the time. However
there have been many houses built      
during the last twenty-five years.     </content>
