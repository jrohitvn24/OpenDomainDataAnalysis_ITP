  The{railway}had now disappeared,too, 
 and so had the Railway Tavern leaving 
 one public house in Willoughby called 
 the Willoughby Arms.The main line of  
 the railway was built in 1848 and went
 to Alford and Louth to the north and  
 Boston to the south.A branch line was 
 added in 1886 which superseded a tram-
 line from Alford to Sutton-on-Sea and 
 Mablethorpe. The station bridge was   
 removed but can still be seen near    
 Burgh-le-Marsh.                       
  There was a blacksmith's forge where 
 Whites now have their lawnmower shop; 
 near White's garage there was a       
 cobbler named Mr.R.Dalton who also    
 made willow baskets;the corner stores 
 has been many things including a fish 
 and chip shop.The Smith's house was a 
 store and was next to a butcher.      </content>
