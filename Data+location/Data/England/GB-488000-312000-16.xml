		<title>16Cottesmore Cubs at Camp</title>
		<content> We went to Cub Camp on 28th June 1985 
 at Ullesthorp.The first thing we did  
 was dive into our tents,because as    
 soon as we got our tents pitched it   
 started to rain.That night we got to  
 bed at 3 A.M. In the morning we did   
 the Grand Howl,our tribe was called   
 Arapaho.We had a number of events that
 day:horse shoe throwing,rope climbing,
 and the rodeo.We went through the     
 woods using our compasses.We ate beans
 at every meal except one which was a  
 casserole.We sat by the camp fire we  
 sang a lot of songs  and it started to
 rain and we all had to stay in our    
 tents.We made some paper guns and     
 head_bands.On the second day we were  
 allowed to dress up as Indians,I got  
 given some war paint.Then we went home
 on the Sunday.
