		<title>05COTTAM VILLAGE</title>
		<content> I live at Cottam near on of the       
 biggest Power Stations in the country,
 which is one of many built along the  
 banks of the River Trent. It makes my 
 house small. Sometimes at night it    
 lets out a sudden burst of steam which
 deafens you. We have a lot of animals 
 including six cats, two dogs and four 
 guinea pigs. My dad works at Rampton  
 Hospital as a stoker. He keeps        
 steam engines and showing is a family 
 interest. We also have a classic bus  
 which we take to rallies every        
 weekend. My hobbies are engines and   
 playing football. There is nothing    
 much to do for children in the        
 village. I travel to school by        
 mini-bus.                             
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
