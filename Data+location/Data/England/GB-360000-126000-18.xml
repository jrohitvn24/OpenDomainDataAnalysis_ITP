 Outside the school is a red{postbox}  
 built into a wall. The first          
 collection is taken at 09.50 am and   
 the second collection is taken at     
 16.45 pm from Monday to Friday. On    
 Saturdays the post comes at 09.50 am. 
 The {postbox}was made when King George
 VI was on the throne.                 
    I feel that it is a pity{postboxes}
 were not included on the Amenities    
 list as they are very important and   
 interesting to study.                 
  It is important for a village to have
 a{telephone box}somewhere in the      
 village in case of an emergency or an 
 accident or a breakdown or just simply
 because a person hasn't got a phone at
 home.In a town or city help is much   
 nearer.
