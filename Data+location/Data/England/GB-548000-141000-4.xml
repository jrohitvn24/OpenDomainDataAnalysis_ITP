		<content> There is no production of energy in   
 the area. The supply of electricity is
 by overhead cable which is subject to 
 interruption by storms. As the lines  
 go through woods which are often      
 overgrown they somestimes touch trees 
 causing breaks. There is no supply of 
 mains gas. Many people use calor gas  
 for heating &amp; cooking to suppliment   
 electricity. Some have battery        
 generators as standby for central     
 heating &amp; milking machines. Most      
 central heating is oil fired. Many    
 homes have wood burning stoves as     
 there is ready access to supplies of  
 logs. A coal merchant delivers fuel   
 from Edenbridge.
