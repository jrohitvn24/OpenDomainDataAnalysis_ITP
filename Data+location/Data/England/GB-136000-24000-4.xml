		<content> BURNEWHALL FARM,which is owned by Lord
 Falmouth,lies in the parish of St     
 Buryan.Burnewhall is farmed by Phil   
 Pengelly and is something of a parish 
 in its own right.                     
 As well as Burnewhall,he runs the 150 
 acre Tower Farm at Sennen where he    
 keeps young dairy stock and beef ,173 
 beasts all told which together with   
 Burnewhall's herd makes 283 mouths to 
 feed.Yet the business only has a      
 workforce of five:Phil himself,his    
 wife Rosemary as secretary,herdsman   
 Irwin Rowe,tractorman Jeremy Parker   
 and pre_college student Lindsay       
 Sowden.Do they ever sleep.....        
 "We're pretty well organised," Phil   
 says with some understatement: "It's  
 essential to keep the two units       
 independent of each other with just   
 the machinery moving between.
