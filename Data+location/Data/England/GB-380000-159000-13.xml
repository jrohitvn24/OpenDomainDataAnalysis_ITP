		<content>  The most amazing recent development  
 is an electrically powered vehicle    
 which has just been mass produced. You
 can see one in our photograph (D).    
 Strangely they have not proved very   
 popular, perhaps because people are   
 doubtful about their reliability. This
 Summer has been the wettest for over  
 100 years and this has not helped     
 sales of the open topped electric car.
  The motor car is still the most      
 popular form of transport though      
 bicycling is increasingly popular.    
 Heavy lorries destroy the peace and   
 calm of our town as well as damaging  
 buildings by vibration and exhaust    
 fumes. Our railway is underused and   
 the service is poor. The canal is     
 being cleared for lesiure use.
