<title>31Farms and Farming</title>
<content>

There is only one dairy farm in Scotton and two beef farms. The beef farmers both grow arable crops such as wheat and barley to feed their cattle, but the dairy farmer only grows grass to feed his. There are not as many farms as there used to be, with the land being taken over by the remaining farmers who are owner-occupiers. The old farm houses have been sold off as family homes with little or no land. There are also a few hobby farmers with only a small amount of land and a few animals kept for a hobby and not as a business to make a profit. A lot of hay and straw is taken through the village on large tractors and trailers heading up to the dales where few arable crops are grown.   &lt;br />
