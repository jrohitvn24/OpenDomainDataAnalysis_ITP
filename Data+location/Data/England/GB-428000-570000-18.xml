		<content>A survey of 150 people in Shiremoor    
showed that whilst a half of the number
said that their only recreation was to 
visit "pubs and clubs" many took part  
team games e.g.football,cricket,darts, 
golf and badminton.Swimming and        
windsurfing were also mentioned as     
growing in popularity although people  
had to travel out of the area to       
participate in them.                   
The more regional hobbies of Whippet   
Racing,Pigeon Racing and Leek Growing  
were the other most popular activities 
of the area.                           
Street Games played by the children    
throughout the area were very much the 
same e.g.Hide and Seek,Hop Scotch and  
Cannon were the most popular,closly    
followed by Stick in the Mud and       
Traffic Lights.
