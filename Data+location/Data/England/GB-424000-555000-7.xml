		<content> Every year Birtley Grenadiers Jazz    
 Band holds a carnival. Which is a sort
 of competition between different Jazz 
 Bands. It is held at the Community    
 Centre Birtley. The manager and       
 trainer are called Daisy and Joe      
 McKenna who live on Vigo estate and   
 the rest of the band live all around  
 them. There are 6O members and they   
 play the gazoo a sort of trumpet,     
 drums and the big bass drum and there 
 is also flag corners. The carnival was
 held on Sunday 21st April 1985. As    
 Birtley is the host band they cannot  
 compete as if they win it would seem  
 unfair. So Birtley Jazz Band can only 
 go on display for practice, and show  
 off their routine and impress the     
 other bands. Another annual event is  
 the fairground that comes to Barley   
 Mow in mid June. It has a variety of  
 rides and stalls.                     </content>
