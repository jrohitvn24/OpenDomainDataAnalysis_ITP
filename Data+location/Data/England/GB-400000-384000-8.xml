 Most of the people in New Mills live  
 mainly in stone built and terraced    
 houses. Only the council houses are   
 rented and the other houses are owned 
 by the people who live in them. There 
 are no tower blocks of flats. The     
 first council houses were erected on  
 the High Hill Road area in 1919-20    
 (High Hill Estate). The Bakehurst     
 Estate was started in 1927. There has 
 been some new council houses like     
 Highfield Estate, Diglands Estate,    
 including extensions to the Bakehurst 
 Estate. 725 council houses have been  
 erected by 1973, some of which have   
 subsequently been sold. There are two 
 private estates which are High Hill   
 and Eaves Knoll. They were built in   
 1960 to 1970.
