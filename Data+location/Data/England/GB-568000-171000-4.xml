		<title>04  CHALK CHURCH</title>
		<content> Chalk Church is about 1000 years old. 
 However,the inside of of the church   
 has been greatly modernised. The      
 church can hold about 250 people.     
 There are three services each week    
 which are attended by people from     
 Chalk, Gravesend and Strood.The Church
 has a tower with three bells but the  
 bells are no longer used.             
   The Church has a flower festival    
 every other year to raise money for   
 the restoration of the Church. It is  
 said that Charles Dickens attended the
 Church each Sunday and loved it there.
 The Church was mentioned in the       
 original domesday book.               
   It is a very attractive Church with 
 many different fellowships for both   
 old and young . These mostly take     
 place in Chalk parish hall.
