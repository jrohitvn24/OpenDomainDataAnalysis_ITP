    The afternoon's festivities        
 included games, sideshows, maypole    
 and country dancing. There was also a 
 Boules Tournament (French style) and a
 football match between Fordingbridge  
 Turks and Vimoutiers.                 
    On Sunday 30th May there was an    
{Interdenominational Service}at        
 St. Mary's Church to celebrate The    
 Twinning. Later in the afternoon two  
 new roads at Westacres were named     
{Vimoutiers Court}and{Normandy Way}to  
 honour our new French friends.        
   {Fordingbridge International        
{Friendship Association,}which         
 pioneered the twinning, are pleased   
 that exchanges between schools, clubs 
 and families continue to stimulate    
 interest and give enjoyment to the    
 residents of both towns.
