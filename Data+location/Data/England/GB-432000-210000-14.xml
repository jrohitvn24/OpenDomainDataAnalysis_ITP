house and built other parts on later   
onewhich was the SW Tower.A man was    
trapped in hidden room.In 1708 some    
workmen found his skeleton which       
fell to dust on discovery.It was       
thought to be the remains of Frances,  
the 9th and last Baron,who was in      
hiding after his involvment in the     
Lambert Simnel Rebellion.In the 17th   
Centur the Manor was owned by Edward   
Coke.Gradually the Manor fell to ruin  
and is now in the care of the Ministry 
of Works.
