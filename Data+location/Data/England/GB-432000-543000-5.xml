 Selby.                                
   We arrived at St. Laurence Church at
 9.40a.m. on 13th June 1985. There we  
 met Mr. Robert Chadwick, our guide,   
 and the Rev.Charles Havens, the vicar.
 They told us that the first church was
 probably a primitive wooden structure 
 in the days of Aidan, 635-651. Then we
 learnt about the Norman church which  
 was a bigger and better building.How- 
 ever it was still only a small church,
 which was made from stone with a      
 wooden roof.                          
   We saw the rare and beautiful 12th  
 century Saxon wall-paintings in the   
 splay of two small round-headed       
 windows. One illustration shows St.   
 Cuthbert being anointed in his youth.
