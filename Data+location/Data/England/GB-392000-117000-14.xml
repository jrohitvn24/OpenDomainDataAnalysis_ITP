		<content>   Most deer are poached by lurcher    
 dogs because they are very silent. It 
 is mostly done at night with a        
 spotlight. The time taken to catch a  
 deer is about three minutes.  Mr Brown
 has caught quite a few poachers but it
 is a very dangerous job. The first lot
 he caught were fined Â£20 but the      
 carcass cost Â£60. The next lot were   
 fined Â£I000 and got 9 months in jail. 
  Mrs Reynolds told us that the area   
 has a very good bird population. Birds
 of prey are plenteous. There are lots 
 of kestrels ,buzzards ,merlins  and   
 sparrow-hawks as well as owls.        
   On the Downs there is a rare        
 butterfly called the Green Hairstreak.
   The best butterfly seen here is the 
 Purple Emperor. After spraying a lot  
 of the butterflies left. There are    
 lots of insects, particularly grass-  
 hoppers which live in the ha-ha.      </content>
