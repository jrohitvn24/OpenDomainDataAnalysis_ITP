		<title>14CHRIST CHURCH ARMLEY LEEDS</title>
		<content>      The church, built in 1872, was   
 completely modernised internally in   
 1984. A number of parishoners had been
 seriously questioning the future of   
 the church, but it was the present    
 vicar who put forward the ideas which 
 were eventually acted upon. To cut the
 high costs of heating, the ceiling was
 lowered and the nave was divided so   
 that 250 to 350 seats can still be    
 used. The side aisles and rear nave   
 are separate sections that include    
 kitchen and toilets with access for   
 disabled. Now the building can more   
 ably cater for a variety of uses for 7
 days a week. Activities include a     
 playgroup, children's clubs, committee
 and prayer meetings and social events,
 as well as the normal services. The   
 total cost of Â£115,000. has mainly    
 been given by the congregation.
