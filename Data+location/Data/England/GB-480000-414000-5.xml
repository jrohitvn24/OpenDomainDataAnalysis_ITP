		<title>05Paul's Day in the village</title>
		<content> I woke up suddenly with the noise of a
 jet flying overhead. As it passed I   
 heard the steady rumble of tractors   
 right outside the house planting      
 potatoes, King Edwards I expect. I got
 dressed and had my breakfast of       
 buttered toast and coffee got my bike 
 and set off. I called for my friends  
 and we went to the playing fields with
 a football. It is right next to St    
 Oswalds Church and they are both out  
 of the main part of the village. After
 about 2 hours we all went home for    
 lunch. We all met later to ride down  
 Ox Pastures, a rough track for the    
 tractors, and onto the river Trent for
 a while. Returning to the village two 
 more RAF training jets flew over. Now 
 it was teatime after which I watched  
 T.V. At about 8pm I went out to play  
 Bingo where I won a Babycham and      
 brass plate which I gave to Mum.      </content>
