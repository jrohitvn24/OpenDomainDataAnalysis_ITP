		<content> This area includes the Eastern half of
 Ingoldmells village and a coastal     
 strip of land which is low lying,flat 
 and criss crossed with drainage dykes,
 except for the elevated coast road of 
 Roman Bank.Protection from the sea is 
 by sand dunes and the sea wall.Until  
 the end of the 1939-1945 War,it was   
 mainly mixed meadow and arable land   
 except for Butlin's Holiday Camp built
 in 1936.Since then,along the coast    
 North of Butlin's and Sea Lane,caravan
 sites have been developed.South of    
 Butlin's is Winthorpe,a district of   
 Skegness where there is the Derbyshire
 Miners' Holiday Home.Nearby is Carey  
 House,a convalescent home for         
 ex-hospital patients.In recent years  
 an estate of bungalows has been       
 erected in Eastern Ingoldmells.In     
 summer the area is crowded and in     
 winter it is deserted.                </content>
