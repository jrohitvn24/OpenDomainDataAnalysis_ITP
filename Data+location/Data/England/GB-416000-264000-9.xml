		<content>  Preston Green is a small commuter    
 hamlet. Almost all of the houses are  
 large and expensive.                  
 There are no local facilities, no     
 school, no shops, not even a telephone
 box. In fact the only thing we saw was
 a post box.                           
 Local industry is farming - mixed     
 arable and grazing. This supports only
 a few families who live in the few    
 farms and farm cottages. Otherwise    
 there is only a family nursery garden 
 and a Bed and Breakfast hotel both    
 situated on the main road ( B4095 ) to
 take advantage of passing trade.      
 Residents obviously travel to Warwick,
 Leamington, Stratford and perhaps even
 Birmingham, both to work and for      
 shopping and for other requirements.
