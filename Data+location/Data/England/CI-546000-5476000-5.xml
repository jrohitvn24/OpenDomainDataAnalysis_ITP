		<title>05  THE TELEPHONE EXCHANGE</title>
		<content> Before the telephone exchange was     
 built all calls had to go through the 
 operator in what is now the Greffe    
 office.Often the person called would  
 be at home but because the Island is  
 small the operator would know where to
 find them and would divert the call to
 the pub,hotel or whereverthe recipient
 was at the time.                      
 Now calls go through the exchange     
 automatically.                        
 Inside the exchange ther are six      
 rooms.The biggest room is the one     
 where calls are received.Another room 
 houses a generator so that if there is
 a power cut the generator in the      
 exchange would start up.If that to    
 fails,then twenty-four batteries will 
 keep the exchange going for up to a   
 day.There is also a 500ft high mast   
 outside.The telephone engineer now has
 his own tractor for service calls.    </content>
