		<title>15EDUCATION IN CHITTERNE</title>
		<content> People in Chitterne were sorry to see 
 the village school close in 1969 but  
 there were insufficient children to   
 keep it open. Primary school children 
 now go to school in Codford or        
 Tilshead, whilst those of secondary   
 age go to Warminster or Market        
 Lavington. Colleges of Further        
 Education are situated in Salisbury   
 and Trowbridge. The Education         
 Authority provides transport to       
 Codford and Warminster. Tilshead      
 School has its own mini bus which     
 collects children from Chitterne, and 
 parents take to Lavington by private  
 car. Travel grants are provided for   
 those attending Colleges. The school  
 bus leaves for Warminster at 7.5O a.m.
 whilst those going to Colleges have to
 be in Codford by 7.3O a.m. to catch   
 the service buses.
