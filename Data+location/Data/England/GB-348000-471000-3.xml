		<content>    St.Oswald's 14th. century church   
is well attended on Sunday mornings.   
Groups include Cubs, Brownies, Scouts, 
Guides, Youth, Mothers Union and Choir 
of 31. The well kept church reflects   
the commitment of a well loved and     
respected vicar, Rev.F.B.Oddy.         
    A small early Methodist Chapel is  
now having much needed extensions,water
supply and toilets. House groups meet  
midweek. There are 27 members but times
when the chapel is crowded. A mission  
in 1985 followed a joint church mission
in 1984.                               
    Hyning Hall, since 1974 home of    
Bernadine Cistercian nuns and Monastery
since 1983, attracts Roman Catholics   
who otherwise go to Yealand, Carnforth,
or Lancaster.  Quakers attend Yealand's
very early Meeting House.  Jehovah's   
Witnesses are active in small numbers  
and meet at Carnforth.                 </content>
