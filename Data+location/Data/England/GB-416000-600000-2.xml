		<title>02A Short History of Felton.</title>
		<content> Felton lies on the main route from    
 Newcastle to Edinburgh on the River   
 Coquet.Many years ago there was a ford
 across the river. The old bridge was  
 built in the 15th Century but was     
 widened twice to cope with the        
 traffic.In the early 1940's a wide    
 bridge was built.At that time there   
 were about 10 shops,a bank and a      
 reading room.There have been at least 
 8 pubs in Felton at different         
 times,some for the travellers going   
 N.,S.or E.to Acklington station.There 
 were also 2 schools.Many of the houses
 on the main street were once shops,you
 can see the signs on the old stone if 
 you look carefully. The present Post  
 Office used to be a pub called        
 the"Widdrington Arms".Another local   
 landowning family was Riddell they    
 built a private R.C.chapel at Felton  
 Park.                                 </content>
