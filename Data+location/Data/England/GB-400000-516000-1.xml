 from{Barnard Castle}and lies in the   
 valley of the{River Tees}.The one     
 storied cottages with their tidy      
 gardens give the village a feudal     
 atmosphere as it is in the shadow of a
 large country manor,{Lartington Hall.

{Domesday Book}as Lertington.Lartington
 Hall was built in the reign of Charles

 Catholics. In nearby{Romaldkirk}church
 there is a tablet to one of the family
 who became Bishop of Cimno in 1767.The
 last descendant,a Catholic priest,died
 at Lartington,in 1897.The family      
 changed its name to Witham in 1800    
 .The{Witham Hall}in Barnard Castle is 
 a memorial to the family.In 1918 the  
 Hall was sold to Norman Field.He and  
 his wife Olive owned the  property    
 until 1973.                           </content>
