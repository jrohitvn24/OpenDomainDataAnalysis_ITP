		<title>01Farmlands in NE Norfolk</title>
		<content> This section is mainly open flat, &amp;   
 arable country, the many fields       
 bordered by hedges &amp; occasional large 
 trees.   There are no villages of any 
 size.   Meandering streams curve round
 the SE part, widening out into two    
 small lakes eventually reaching South 
 Walsham Broad.   There are several    
 densely wooded plantations on the     
 undulating slopes above the streams.  
 Except for the NE corner near         
 Ransworth, where there are orchards &amp; 
 young tree plantations, the land is   
 intensively farmed.   At Ransworth    
 there is a fine church containing a   
 painted screen &amp; an illuminated       
 antiphoner.  Eastward lies Malthouse  
 broad, much frequented by holiday     
 crusiers &amp; yachts, where adequate     
 mooring &amp; shopping facilities exist.  
 Nearby a lane leads to a nature       
 conservation centre of great interest.</content>
