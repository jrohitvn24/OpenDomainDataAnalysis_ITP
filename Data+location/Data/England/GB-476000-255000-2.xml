		<title>02  Wootton  Parish  Church.</title>
		<content>  The church is in the centre of       
Wootton on High Street. It has some    
features dating from the thirteenth    
century and it is thought that the     
tower was not originally part of the   
church and is older.                   
  The church is built of stone of      
varying colours and there is a         
weathercock at the top of the tower.   
The entrance is at the back because    
the north porch was demolished when    
High Street was improved.              
  The first rector was Walter de       
Bidum who died in 1178. There are      
five bells, four of them dating back   
to the seventeenth century, and they   
have been rehung in an iron frame.The  
Saint George window is by William      
Morris.
