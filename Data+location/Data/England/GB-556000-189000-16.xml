		<title>16LEISURE AMENITIES: WARLEY</title>
		<content>   The main leisure facilities, apart  
 from Public Houses in Great Warley,   
 are to be found in a large{golf course
 (Club House 598904), the various      
{woodlands}(although there is only a   
 public right of way through one of    
 these - 5992), Tyler's Common 5690,   
 now uncomfortably close to the M25 and
 certain{riding stables}where lessons  
 may be taken. Outdoor sports are      
 played on the common, and people      
 occasionally walk through the woods - 
 although most drive through them at   
 high speed. Most leisure activities   
 are undoubtedly pursued outside the   
 block, however, in one of the         
{surrounding urban areas}of Brentwood, 
 Upminster, Romford or Harold Wood, all
 of which have Sports' Centres; or else
 in{London}itself, easily accessible by
 train (31 minutes from Brentwood),    
 less easily by car.                   </content>
