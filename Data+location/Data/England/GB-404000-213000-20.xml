 Compton Casey _ through Chedworth Wood
 _ and so to Cirencester and beyond.   
     At  {Compton  Casey  }the   partly
 demolished{17 C. mansion, }once a farm
 house,  is now a privately rented home
 with few signs of the former elegance.

 was a slow rural link for Cheltenham /
 Cirencester.Foss Cross station handled
 farm crops, quarry stone and coal.

 for its Oolitic limestone exposures.
