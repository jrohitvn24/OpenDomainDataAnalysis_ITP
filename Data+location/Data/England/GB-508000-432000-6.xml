		<title>06 HOUSES AND UNDERPASSES</title>
		<content> A  VILLAGE PLAN IS WHERE PEOPLE       
 CHANGE ROUND THE HOUSES SO THAT       
 THE BACK GARDEN IS SMALLER AND THE    
 FRONT IS BIGGER.                      
 SUTTON PARK WAS BUILT LIKE THIS       
 BECAUSE THE ROADS ARE DANGEROUS AND   
 IT IS MORE FRIENDLY. WE FOUND  OUT    
 ABOUT THE HOUSES BY DOING A SURVEY.   
 THE DANGERS  OF SHORT BACK GARDENS    
 ARE THAT CHILDREN PLAYED IN THE BACK  
 GARDENS AND RAN OUT INTO THE MAIN     
 ROADS. AN UNDERPASS  IS A KIND OF PATH
 THAT GOES UNDER THE ROADS. THE        
 UNDERPASS IS MESSY WET AND HORRIBLE.  
 PEOPLE DON'T USE THE UNDERPASS BECAUSE
 THERE ARE BIG CHILDREN ABOUT 16 WHO   
 MUG PEOPLE GOING THROUGH. THEY HANG   
 AROUND THE UNDERPASS. INSTEAD OF THE  
 UNDERPASS WE COULD HAVE A FLYOVER THAT
 GOES OVER THE ROAD INSTEAD OF AN      
 UNDERPASS THAT GOES UNDER THE ROAD.
