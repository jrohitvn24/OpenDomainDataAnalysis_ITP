		<title>10BEVERTON FARM</title>
		<content> We visited the old man who lived at   
 Beverton Farm, this farm is typical of
 the traditional farms in the area.    
 It used to be a sixty acre farm with  
 cattle and sheep but he has now sold  
 off most of the land and is left with 
 five acres around his house.          
 The farmhouse had once been lived in  
 by the engine driver from the iron ore
 railway and subsequently by the       
 present owners parents. He has lived  
 there all his life, 74 years. He has  
 never married and now lives on his    
 own. The farmhouse used to be one down
 two up but his parents extended it on 
 both sides and it now has four        
 bedrooms. The walls are of stone      
 and both the roof and some of the     
 walls are covered with slates.        
 He has had visits from various firms  
 trying to persuade him to spend money 
 on it but he has not done so.         </content>
