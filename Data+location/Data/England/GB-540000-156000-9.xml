Daddy wakes me at 7.30 a.m. all ready  
for work, his electric calculator      
inside his briefcase.  I dress in my   
green and red uniform, then downstairs 
for breakfast of cereal and orange     
juice.  To school in Mummy's mini -    
school starts at 9.05 a.m.  We use the 
school computer in groups to solve     
puzzles. Lunchtime is sandwiches for   
me but my friend has a cooked meal at  
12.20 p.m.  We use the Adventure       
Playground and top field in fine       
weather and go swimming in the heated  
pool in summer.  School ends at 3 p.m. 
Some children have Beavers or Cubs     
after school.  I am in the Beavers and 
go swimming at West Wickham and to     
Disco Dancing.  I watch children's T.V.
for a long time and my favourite supper
is fish and chips. I go to bed at 8    
p.m. and read for a while.             </content>
