		<content> In the district there are five state  
 primary schools for children aged     
 5-11.The two city schools also have a 
 nursery for 3-5 year olds.At 10 or 11 
 children transfer to comprehensive    
 schools in the city or county.Our     
 school,Willowbrook is just inside the 
 city boundary. It is nearly 30 years  
 old.This is what we do at school.Every
 morning we play in the playground     
 until the whistle goes,then we line up
 outside our classroom.When our teacher
 lets us in,we hang our coats in the   
 cloakroom.I wish we could take our    
 things in our room so no one could get
 them.While the teacher does the       
 register,we do our spellings and      
 tables.Then we go to assembly where   
 the headmaster tells us a story and we
 sing hymns and say our prayers.
