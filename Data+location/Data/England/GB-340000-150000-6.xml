		<title>06Inside Ashton Windmill</title>
		<content> Inside the tower of Ashton Windmill on
 the bottom floor is a large wooden    
 wheel with cogs called a spur         
 wheel.There is a brake on it to stop  
 the shaft which runs from top to      
 bottom turning.Up some wooden steps   
 are the two large grindstones which   
 the shaft turns.The corn is put       
 between them and the top one turns    
 round.The bags of corn are put on a   
 hook and pulled through three         
 trapdoors to the top where it is put  
 in a shute which goes to the          
 grindstones.The top of the windmill is
 the 'engine room' which makes         
 everything happen.The sails outside   
 are attached to the shaft by large cog
 wheels.There is a brake switch to stop
 the sails turning too quickly in a    
 strong wind.The whole cap can be      
 turned so that it faces the way the   
 wind is blowing.                      </content>
