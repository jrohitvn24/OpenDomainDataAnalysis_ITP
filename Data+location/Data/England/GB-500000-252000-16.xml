		<title>16Fishing on the Ouse</title>
		<content> Bedford Angling Club owns the majority
 of the fishing rights for the section 
 of the Ouse which runs through the    
 area.  There are four main stretches: 
 Oakley Main, The Backstream, College  
 Farm and Stafford Bridge.             
 Oakley Main - Oakley Main is a wide,  
 fast flowing stretch with straight    
 open banks.   The river bed is about  
 2 metres deep at the edges and slopes 
 away to about 3O metres towards the   
 centre of the river.   The main       
 species caught in this section is     
 bream but there are also pike, perch, 
 roach and bleak.                      
 The Backstream - The river is         
 shallower and not as fast flowing and 
 consequently species more suited to   
 these conditions such as chub and     
 tench can be caught as well as those  
 mentioned above.
