   Being an{agricultural area,}farming 
 is the most obvious source of employ_ 
 ment.But a larger %age of the popula_ 
 tion here{commute}by car or bus(there 
 is a regular,convenient service)into  
 large nearby settlements eg.Oswestry  
 (only 4km away at its furthest),Welsh_
 pool(12km away from Llynclys)or Shrew_
 sbury.Many people in our area work in 
 Dol_y_Goch quarry,east of and outside 
 our area.Because the area is{sparsely 
{populated}there is{little unemployment
 among the residents compared to that  
 expected and found in large nearby    
 settlements.However,this part of Shro_
 pshire in general has low unemployment
   The younger section of the populat_ 
 ion prefer to work in large settle_   
 ments outside the area,where there are
 more leisure facilities for them and  
 wages are generally higher.           </content>
