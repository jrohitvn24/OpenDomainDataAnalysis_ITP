		<title>01SUMMARY OF AREA AS A WHOLE</title>
		<content> This area is very rural and peaceful  
 with only one shop. There are two     
 churches and about 14 or 15 farms with
 quiet country lanes connecting them.  
 There are very friendly people here   
 who will always talk and help you.    
 There is only one school but very nice
 at that. There is one garage which    
 always helps you and your car out of  
 any trouble. There is a track leading 
 to a chalk pit from which you can get 
 a lovely view. Every house has a      
 splendid view out on to some field or 
 down some lane. There is only one pub 
 called "The Gaggle of Geese" and there
 is a friendly atmosphere whenever you 
 go in.{Buckland Newton}               
 is the only village but there are     
 little hamlets.These are{Duntish,     
{Brockhampton Green}and{Beaulieu Wood.
