		<content>{The Chaucer Hospital,}built on the    
 edge of farmland, was opened in 1982. 
 It provides private care as an        
 alterna- tive to National Health      
 Service hospitals. The hospital with  
 48 beds, has two operating theatres,  
 an inten- sive care unit, and         
 radiology and physiotherapy           
 departments. All bedrooms have private
 shower and toilet,nurse-to-patient    
 intercom and electrically operated    
 beds. Food is of a high standard      
 prepared by top class chefs for       
 patients, staff and visitors. Visiting
 hours are flexible. About 200 staff   
 are employed. Nursing staff are fully 
 trained in the latest techniques. Fees
 are from Â£126 per day, plus surgeons' 
 and treatment fees. There are insur-  
 ance schemes to cover the cost of     
 private hospital treatment and some   
 employers offer this as a benefit.    </content>
