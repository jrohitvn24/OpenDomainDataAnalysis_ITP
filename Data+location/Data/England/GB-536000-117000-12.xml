		<content> I live on a farm and we have a very   
 busy life we have 117 sheep, 8 cows   
 some ducks, chickens, dogs, cats,     
 geese and a pony. I have two brothers 
 and twice a year we dip the sheep.    
 Every sheep has to be dipped by law   
 against scab and flystrike. Twice a   
 year we also have to shear them. You  
 start off at the rear of the sheep and
 work up its tummy until you get to its
 head then you turn the sheep over and 
 start on its back. once they are shorn
 you have told fold the flece in a     
 special way and then it is put into a 
 sack and sent to be sold.
