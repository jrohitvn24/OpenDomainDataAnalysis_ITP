		<content> There is only 1 "A" class road,the    
 A5087,in the area and it passes along 
 the eastern edge skirting the coast   
 and is locally called the "Coast Road"
 It was built during the depression of 
 the 1920's.A two-hourly bus service   
 runs along this route connecting      
 Barrow and Ulverston.Another          
 two-hourly service links Barrow and   
 Ulverston further inland via the      
 villages of Leece and Gleaston.There  
 is no railway line through the area.  
 About 70% of the people travel to work
 in the nearby towns by private car.
