 I woke up at 8.00am this morning and  
 went down stairs. I got dressed into  
 my school clothes and had my          
 breakfast.I sat down to watch TVAM.   
 Ann Diamond was on with some other    
 people but I didn't find it very      
 interesting so I went out in the      
 kichen to pack my bag.It was coming up
 to 8.50am now so I went to school. To 
 start the day we did Maths English and
 some reading. Then it was playtime.   
 After play we did some work on the    
 computer until dinner time. At dinner 
 time I washed my hands and went in for
 dinner. We had sausages, mashed       
 potatoes and baked beans. For pudding 
 we had apple crumble.During the       
 afternoon we did some painting. At    
 3.30pm we went home and I played      
 badminton until 6pm.Then I watched    
 TV until my bedtime at 9pm.           </content>
