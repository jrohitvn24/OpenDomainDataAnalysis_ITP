		<title>03FARMING AND FISHING</title>
		<content> The area is mainly pastoral land used 
 for beef cattle,dairy cows and sheep. 
 Many of the cows are Friesian and some
 of the sheep are from the Lake        
 District to winter in this area       
 because of its unusually mild winters.
 A small part of the area is devoted to
 market gardening with the produce sold
 at the Barrow and Ulverston markets.  
 Vegetables grown include potatoes,    
 cabbages and turnips.Farming is mainly
 run as a family business with little  
 necessity for hired help.The working  
 day is normally the 12 hours from     
 6a.m. to 6p.m. Farm buildings are     
 built mainly from carboniferous       
 limestone but with some built from    
 beach pebbles cemented together.Since 
 some of the land is very wet,deep     
 drainage ditches augment hedges and   
 barbed wire as field boundaries.
