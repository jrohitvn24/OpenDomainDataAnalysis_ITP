		<content> 1I was sent to the accident and       
 emergency department at Pinderfields  
 General Hospital as part of my        
 pre-nursing course. The Casualty      
 department is the hospitals "Clearing 
 House". Here your condition, whether  
 minor or serious, will be assessed and
 you will be given whatever immediate  
 treatment is needed before being      
 discharged or transferred to another  
 department. They have no particular   
 routine in this department as         
 different cases are brought in at all 
 times whether during the day or at    
 night. The staff working in this      
 department are specialists in such    
 emergency cases. They have to be alert
 at all times and prepared for the     
 worst. I really enjoyed my time there 
 and I am looking forward to my nursing
 course even more than before.
