		<title>04 BUYING A COUNCIL HOUSE</title>
		<content>                                       
  Greenwich council does not think     
selling houses that belong to the      
council is a good thing because it     
means that they have fewer houses for  
people that need them.They have not a  
lot of money to build more or the land 
to build houses with gardens.It is     
government policy to sell them.Bromley 
council approves of selling council    
houses.                                
   The houses have not got garages and 
the roads are too narrow.Many people   
now have cars and this is causing      
problems.                              
   We think it is nice to be able to   
buy your own house but we feel sorry   
for those people in flats or houses in 
bad condition or without gardens.
