		<content> The Norman Prince pursued the doe,    
 Between the trees in heated chase,    
 And loosed the arrow from his bow,    
 And quaffed red wine with princely    
 grace.                                
                                       
 The aged miner on his stick,          
 Rested awhile between the rows,       
 Of little houses on the hill,         
 And supped his ale with dominoes.     
                                       
 The concrete palace taunts the sky,   
 Trees and factory all are done,       
 The motorway cuts straight as die,    
 The moor from which the doe has gone. 
                                       
 The watching eye records unseen,      
 The passing of our deeds and names,   
 And under all and overall,            
 Nine hundred years the land remains.  
                                       
                                       </content>
