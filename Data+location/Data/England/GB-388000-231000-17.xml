		<content>  My working day starts at around      
 8.30am,the first step is to sort out  
 the willow in different sizes         
 according to the type of basket I am  
 going to make.I then put them into a  
 big water tank to soak for about      
 45mins.I then have a cup of tea and   
 some toast.                           
  I return to my workshop,take the     
 willow out of the tank which by now is
 supple so I can work it to make the   
 basket.While I work I listen to the   
 radio, the station I prefer is radio  
 4.My lunchtime is 1 o'clock. I take   
 about half an hour and then carry on  
 until around 4pm which is cup of tea  
 and biscuit time.                     
  I have by this time made a variety of
 baskets and my finishing time is      
 around 5.30pm.I then sort out some    
 more willow for the following day.
