		<title>19SHOPS AND POST OFFICE</title>
		<content> We went to the Post Office and the    
 post is collected at 6.00 a.m. and    
 4.00 p.m. The Post Office opens at    
 9.00 a.m. and closes at 5.30 p.m. They
 sell groceries, seeds and paints. We  
 went  to Prices Supermarket and it    
 opens every day and it sells bread,   
 ice cream, cakes, tins of food,       
 sweets, books and cards. The owner    
 gets up at 6.30 a.m. The bread is     
 delivered at 7.15 a.m. It opens at    
 8.00 a.m. He has to go to the         
 warehouse 3 times a week. He has 2    
 tills. Each night he puts money in the
 safe. He goes to the bank two times a 
 week and he has to sweep the floor as 
 well. We went to the shop by the      
 canal. We found out that it opened    
 from 8.00 a.m. until 5.00 p.m. and it 
 sold post cards, crisps, sweets, ice  
 cream, milk, bread and eggs.
