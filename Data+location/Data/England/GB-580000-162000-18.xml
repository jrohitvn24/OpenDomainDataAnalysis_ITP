       Paris Farm consists of 175 acres
 (approximately 70 hectares)  and is  a
 small family concern  which started in
 1900. Various  crops are grown, mainly
 cereals: oats, wheat and barley. These
 are  grown  and  harvested  using  two
 tractors  and  two combine harvesters.
 The oats  are  used as animal feed and
 the wheat  and  barley are sold. Sheep
 are raised  on  the  farm also. At the
 moment  there  are 200  ewes  and  200
 lambs. The  owner  and  three  helpers
 shear the  sheep  themselves  and sell
 the wool. At  one  time  the  farm was
 served   by  a  lorry   which  brought
 groceries  but now the family shops at
 the  SavaCentre,  a  local hypermarket
 and shopping centre.
