		<title>07 Gypsum Mining</title>
		<content>  Gypsum is mined at Fauld.It is a     
white rock and quite soft. The mine and
the mill are completely mechanised and 
give jobs to 260 people.It also        
provides jobs for haulage people.      
 They produce 6000 tonnes of bagged    
plaster a week and 12000 tonnes of     
other products. Chalk is also made from
gypsum.The rain water that seeps       
through gypsum is used for brewing     
beer.That is probably why it is the    
best beer in the world. Alabaster is a 
hard form of gypsum. It can be carved  
into attractive statues and ornaments. 
  In 1894 an order of 18 alabaster     
blocks was carried out. the alabaster  
was used for building a mansion in New 
York. It was being built for Cornelius 
Vanderbilt.Some of the blocks weighed  
15 tonnes each.They were cut by hand   
loaded and transported out of the mine 
by horse and cart.                     </content>
