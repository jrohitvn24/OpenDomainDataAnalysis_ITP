		<title>17GAMES WE PLAY</title>
		<content> At school we play a lot of different  
 games,we play{Bulldog, Tiggy, 45 and  
{in, cricket}and{football.}In{Bulldog  
 someone is on and others stand behind 
 a line and the person who is on picks 
 a person and that person has to dodge 
 the person who is on who is trying to 
 catch him. If he gets into the        
 semi_circle the others run into the   
 semi_cicle and if someone gets caught 
 they are on with the original catcher.
                                       
{45 AND IN                             
{---------                             
 45 and in is a very fast game and can 
 be dangerous. One person is on and    
 stays counting at a post up to 45 and 
 the others hide and have to run to the
 post and say 45 and in before they are
 caught.
