		<title>16MARWOOD N. THE "CHURCH"</title>
		<content>     This block has no Parish          
 Church,only the little chapel         
 at Middle Marwood.However the Reverand
 Cranston lives in Middle Marwood and  
 he is the non_stipendary vicar for    
 MARWOOD.Previously he had been a      
 research scientist for B.P. With a    
 company pension he was able to offer  
 his services to the Bishop of         
 Exeter who decided that MARWOOD needed
 him most.He spends time home visiting 
 preparing for sermons and talks.I     
 asked him what he was most pleased    
 that he had been able to achieve and  
 he said,"Sunday congregations have    
 risen from 10-50 and I'm pleased I am 
 working with the other chapels        
 within MARWOOD parish.We run two youth
 groups (Adventurers and Teenagers), a 
 house fellowship and joint services   
 together.                             
                                       </content>
