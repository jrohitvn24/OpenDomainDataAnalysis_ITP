		<title>04Buxted Chicken Farm_Boreham</title>
		<content> We went to{Buxted Chicken Factory,}   
 Boreham,and met Bill Jefferies.We saw 
 all the chickens being unloaded from  
 the truck and being put onto a        
 revolving rack.They went behind the   
 truck and when they came round they   
 were unconscious.We then saw some     
 slides which showed us a pool of      
 electrified water called a water      
 stunner.It showed us the chickens     
 throats being cut and there was a lot 
 of{blood.}If the machine didn't cut   
 the throats a man would do them. The  
 feathers were taken off in a tank at a
{180}degs.They were cleaned in Chlorine
 water.Then all their insides were     
 taken out and necks and feet were     
 pulled off.They were weighed and      
 wrapped.There are{190}workers and it  
 was opened in{1961.}Buxted are the    
 largest chicken producers in Britain. 
 They pack 100 per min.&amp; 6000 an hour. </content>
