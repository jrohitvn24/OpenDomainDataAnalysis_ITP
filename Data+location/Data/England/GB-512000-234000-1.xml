 Shillington is a village of some 2000 
 inhabitants. Its centre is clustered  
 around the grand, historic church with
 its partly renovated buttresses       
 reflecting their shiny newness in the 
 sun. Money is still being raised to   
 complete the job, which is scheduled  
 to take another two years and to cost 
 #90 000.                              
                                       
 At the time of writing, there is no   
 parish priest and during the          
 interregnum, lay people are attending 
 to the Pastoral care of the village.  
 The Bishop of Bedford will collate    
 Father Dennis Morgan to the benefice  
 on November 27th. 1985.
