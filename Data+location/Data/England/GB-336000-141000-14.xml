 The Richards  own a holiday home,they 
 advertise through an agency called    
 Summer cottages,they say that the     
 main attraction is being in the middle
 of Somerset near Street,Glastambury   
 and Chedder.The holiday home has been 
 there for about four years.Most people
 come here between Easter and          
 September.Young and old people stay   
 for one to two weeks or more.The      
 holiday home is a house which         
 accomodates twelve adults and two     
 childrens cots but pets are not       
 allowed.Approximately two hundred and 
 fifty people stay a year,the majority 
 of people come from the British Isles 
 although,Americans,Dutch and Germans  
 stay.They also own a shop which is a  
 Post Office and it is right next to   
 the holiday home.                     </content>
