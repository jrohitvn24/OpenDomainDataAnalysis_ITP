		<title>01ST.MARTINS ISLES OF SCILLY.</title>
		<content>  St.Martins is one of five            
 inhabited islands in the Isles of     
 Scilly,it is the third largest        
 island.It lies in the Atlantic Ocean  
 approximately 27 miles from Lands     
 End.On St.Martins there is a resident 
 population of 88 but sometimes        
 fishermen come and stay in cottages or
 chalets and it increases then.The     
 people of St.Martins live in three    
 little hamlets called Lower           
 Town,Middle                           
 Town and Higher Town.Higher Town is   
 the largest hamlet and the most people
 live there.The island is approximately
 three kilomeres long and one kilometre
 wide in the widest place.On the       
 Northern side the landscape is        
 very rocky and it has lots of         
 cliffs.Butthe Southern side is nearly 
 all white sandy beaches,which make a  
 softer landscape.                     </content>
