		<title>13Hythe Town Council</title>
		<content>    Until 1974 Hythe was a borough with
 a council which operated all main     
 survices in the town. After this date 
 the former borough council of Hythe   
 was abolished and its powers          
 transferred to the new District       
 Council called{Shepway.}Hythe was     
 created a parish, but because of its  
 size conferred on itself the status of
 the town. This gave the town the right
 to elect a{Town Mayor.                
                                       
    The Mayor or his deputy chairs each
 meeting of the Town Council. There are
 18 Town Councillors in all. Their job 
 in the meeting is to decide on how the
 Parish precept, raised through the    
 rates, should be spent. The Council   
 has to fund and administer allotment  
 sites, recreation grounds and open    
 spaces in the town.
