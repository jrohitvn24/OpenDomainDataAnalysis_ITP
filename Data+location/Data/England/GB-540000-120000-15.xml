		<title>15RECREATION IN OLD NEWICK</title>
		<content> Today we have a great deal of leisure 
 time, whereas in the past there was   
 little time for recreation but there  
 are many similarities between the     
 sports of then and now. In the Middle 
 Ages travelling jugglers, acrobats and
 performing bears would have come      
 regularly to the Green, just as the   
 fair still comes today. Hunting the   
 fox (and the wolf in the past) has    
 always been a popular,if controversial
 pastime. Other sports were archery    
 (promoted by Henry VIII), football (an
 exceedingly rough game, involving many
 balls and many players), gambling and 
 dicing, tennis (for the rich only) and
 bowling. All these sports are popular 
 today although their manner and their 
 rules may have changed somewhat. One  
 sport which has fortunately died out  
 is cudgel play where they tried to    
 crack each others' skulls with sticks!</content>
