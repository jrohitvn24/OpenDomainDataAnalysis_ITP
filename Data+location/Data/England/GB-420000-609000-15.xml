		<content> Take for instance the City of London; 
 it would be very unlikley that the    
 people living there would know someone
 in the next street, but in our block  
 it is much different, both Lesbury and
 Hipsburn villages are quite small and 
 the people living there would probably
 know their neighbours well enough to  
 call them by name in the street.      
 There are not many children in our    
 block so there is only one school,    
 which is a primary school with only 58
 children attending. When the children 
 reach the age of nine they go on to   
 Lindisfarne Middle School, which is in
 Alnwick three miles away, so they have
 to catch a bus each morning. There    
 they are joined by children from other
 first schools near Alnwick.
