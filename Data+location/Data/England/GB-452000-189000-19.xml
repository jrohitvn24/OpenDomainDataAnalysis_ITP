		<content>Didcot Labour Club has 450 members who 
pay 1.26p when they first join, then   
1.00p each year. It opens at 11 am     
except on Wednesday and again at 7 pm. 
There is a bar, a billiards table and a
ballroom, which is upstairs.  This can 
be hired by members who want to hold a 
private function.  A kitchen may also  
be hired.                              
The Duke of Marlborough's grandfather  
opened the Marlborough Club about 50   
years ago.  Both the old and very      
expensive snooker tables came with the 
building.  Most of the 400 members, who
own the Club, are local.  The Club is  
open seven days a week.  It also has a 
Theatre Club and, like the Labour      
Club, its rooms may be hired for       
special purposes, such as weddings and 
lectures.  There used to be a tennis   
court, but it no longer exists.
