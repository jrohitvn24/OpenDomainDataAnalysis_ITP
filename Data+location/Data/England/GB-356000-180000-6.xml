		<title>06The Labour Club, Patchway</title>
		<content>    To join this club you have to pay  
 Â£2.60 every year.  It is open to      
 everyone over 18 years of age.        
    It began in Hazeldene Road in 1950,
 and was moved to the new club building
 in Coniston Parade in 1969.  It was   
 opened by L.W.Bosisto Esq J.P.  He was
 the club founder and president. The   
 club has a lounge, a function room and
 a hall.  In the lounge people can buy 
 drinks and snacks, play bingo, darts, 
 skittles, pool and snooker. There is a
 T.V. and Video, fruit machines and a  
 "Space Invader" game in the lounge    
 too.  A dance is held in the every    
 Saturday.  The function room is       
 used for parties etc.  I have been in 
 the bingo hall with my mum, nanny and 
 grandad.  Once I won Â£2.60.  Children 
 aren't allowed to go in there any more
 as it is very rough.  Often it is     
 noisy and some people have fights.    </content>
