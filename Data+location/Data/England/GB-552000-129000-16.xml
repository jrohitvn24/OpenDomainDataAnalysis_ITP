		<content> The Parish Council has no powers over 
 Transport, but takes an interest in   
 decisions that are being made.The Sec_
 retary of State plans to close the    
 Eridge to Tonbridge railway line.This 
 is against peoples' wishes, the Eridge
 Line  Support Group has been formed.  
 Trains leave Crowborough for London &amp; 
 Uckfield and are used by commuters.3  
 mornings a week the Parish Council    
 organise a free bus to take elderly   
 people shopping in Crowboro'.Other    
 residents use cars, bicycles or taxis.
 Many commuters live in Crowboro' be_  
 cause property is cheaper.Some travel 
 from Crowboro' others drive to Tunbri_
 dge Wells where trains are faster &amp;   
 more frequent.They find the journeys  
 tiring and many would prefer to work  
 in Crowborough if opportunities arose.
 It takes over an hour to reach London.
