		<title>13Events in Debenham.</title>
		<content>  An exciting event in 1985 has been   
the presence of BBC film crews.To quote
the East Anglian Daily Times:-         
  "Foresters Hall Antique Shop has been
transformed from its usual sedate role 
as an antiques showroom to a busy,     
crowded auction room for the new series
Â£Lovejoy'.Lovejoy is a lovable antiques
dealer and the character will travel,in
the series,through Suffolk and return  
from time to time to the Â£auction      
rooms' at Debenham when the plot       
requires it."                          
  The two top Junior classes from the  
Primary School had an exciting day when
they took part in the Suffolk Schools  
History Project at Orford Castle in    
July.A day in the year 1173 was        
enacted,the children taking the part   
of apprentices.They practised several  
medieval skills,and saw their Head-    
master put in the pillory for theft.   </content>
