		<content> The entire block is hilly farming land
 sparsley populated. The ground rises  
 between 400ft to over 1000ft in places
 and none of the fields are flat. Farms
 are small family concerns employing   
 little or no outside labour. Mostly   
 sheep graze outside all year round,   
 but some are over-wintered under cover
 feeding on hay and silage. Cattle are 
 reared for beef, there is no arable   
 farming. The water treatment works in 
 Station Road provides employment for  
 two or three men who live on the site.
 About six times a year point-to-point 
 races are held on the race course east
 of the road at Stowford Cross and are 
 very popular with local people. South 
 Stowford Farm is the Exmoor Bird      
 Gardens and attracts many holiday     
 visitors to the see exotic birds and  
 smalll animals. It is owned by two    
 families who live on the premises.    </content>
