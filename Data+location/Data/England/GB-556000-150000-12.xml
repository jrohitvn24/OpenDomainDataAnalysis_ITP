		<title>12Shipbourne C.P. School.</title>
		<content> Shipbourne school was built in 1852 as
 Shipbourne National and Industrial    
 School.It is made from Kentish        
 ragstone and red brick.               
 There are now 50 pupils who come from 
 the village and Tonbridge but in the  
 past century there were as many as 120
 because there were no schools in the  
 neighbouring villages.                
 We do maths,creative writing,art,     
 sport and music.We do many projects   
 for which we visit places of          
 interest.Each term we hold a concert  
 and at Christmas time we perform a    
 pantomime.Although we are a small     
 school we have a swimming pool,a      
 computer and a film projector.
