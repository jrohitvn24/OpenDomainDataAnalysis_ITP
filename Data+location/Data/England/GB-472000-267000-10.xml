		<title>10PITSFORD VILLAGE SHOPKEEPER</title>
		<content> IN ADDITION TO THE ACTUAL SHOP, MY    
 LIVING ACCOMMODATION IS ALSO IN THIS  
 BUILDING.THE UPSTAIRS FLAT IS QUITE   
 SMALL BUT COMFORTABLE AND VERY NICE.  
 SINCE COMING HERE TWO YEARS AGO I HAVE
 FOUND THE VILLAGERS TO BE VERY NICE,  
 FRIENDLY AND KIND.                    
 BECAUSE THE SHOP IS A GENERAL STORE I 
 SELL ANYTHING FROM EGGS AND BACON TO  
 SCOURERS AND FURNITURE POLISH.        
 I DO NOT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT TRANSPORT
 TO WORK AS I LIVE OVER THE SHOP, BUT I
 DO HAVE TO GO TO THE WHOLESALE        
 WAREHOUSE OCCASIONALLY IN ORDER TO    
 RESTOCK THE SHELVES FOR MY CUSTOMERS. 
 THE SHOP IS OPEN FROM 9-00 A.M. UNTIL 
 5-30 P.M. DAILY EXCEPT ON THURSDAYS   
 AND SATURDAYS WHEN I CLOSE AT MID-DAY.
 THESE TWO HALF-DAYS AND THE WHOLE OF  
 SUNDAY GIVE ME SOME LEISURE TIME IN   
 WHICH TO READ OR TAKE A WALK BY THE   
 RESERVOIR AND ENJOY ITS BEAUTY &amp; PEACE</content>
