		<title>08Industry: Kilns old &amp; new</title>
		<content> The largest industry in the block is  
 the firm of Timbmet which kiln-dries  
 timber from all over the world and    
 supplies rare woods for repair or     
 renovation of woodwork in historic    
 buildings eg. the Bodleian Library.   
 Its kilns are on the site of the      
 ancient Chawley brickworks where      
 bricks were made by hand until        
 1940 and a saw mill operated until    
 1963. About 220 people are employed by
 the firm.                             
 At Farmoor on the edge of the block   
 there is a small panel beating works  
 which carries out car body repairs.
