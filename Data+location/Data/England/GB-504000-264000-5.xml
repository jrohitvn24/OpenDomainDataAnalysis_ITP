		<title>05Restoring Swineshead Church</title>
		<content> At the moment the church is in the    
 process of a major restoration        
 programme, to date, the spire, south  
 wall and roof have been completed. The
 villagers help in various ways with   
 the church restoration. One way, was  
 manual help by digging a trench around
 the church which was filled with      
 gravel. This was done to help fight   
 against rising damp.                  
 Other means are peoples support in    
 fund raising events which are held    
 throughout the year. All of these     
 activities require lots of voluntary  
 help and donations depending on the   
 event.
