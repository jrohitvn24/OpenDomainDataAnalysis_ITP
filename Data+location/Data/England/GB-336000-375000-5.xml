		<title>05 MEMORIES OF GREAT SUTTON</title>
		<content>   Two ladies have spoken about Great  
 Sutton's development during the{last  
{sixty years. Mrs.Price}remembers the  
 village as a farming community.{Mrs.  
{Foxhall}was born on Mount Farm in     
 1923. She remembers taking the cows   
 down the lane to the fields and       
 milking them in the "shippons"        
 (cowsheds). There were no flats or    
 houses, but two pubs,the{White Swan   
{and the Bull's Head.}The village      
 school was called "Eleanor school".   
 If you did anything naughty either    
 inside or outside school you would be 
 caned.                                
   In{1934 the by-pass was built.}Now  
 there are houses and roads where there
 used to be fields. Interesting road   
 names include: Gerrard Avenue (after  
 Dr.Gerrard), Beasley Close (after Sir 
 Gordon Beasley), Demage Drive (changed
 from the original Dangerous Meadow).  </content>
