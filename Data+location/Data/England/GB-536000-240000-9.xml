		<title>09HOUSING ESTATES IN ROYSTON</title>
		<content> I live on the {Ridings}and in front of
 our front garden is a path,and on the 
 other side of the path are more       
 houses.We are quite near the town,and 
 the school is only a few minutes walk 
 away.We are also near the park,but we 
 have to go round the corner to get to 
 our garage.                           
 The {Shaftesbury}estate is off Barkway
 Road.It is made up of two roads.The   
 gardens are very steep.At the bottom  
 there are mostly terraced or semi -   
 detached houses.My house is a special 
 kind.It is a staggered,terraced house.
 It is also split-level.It has a hill  
 onto Grange Bottom.There are several  
 car parking spaces.                   
 My house is on{Poplar Drive}estate.   
 Forty years ago Honey Way was on an   
 army camp and my uncle was stationed  
 there in the war.Now there are many   
 modern houses.                        </content>
