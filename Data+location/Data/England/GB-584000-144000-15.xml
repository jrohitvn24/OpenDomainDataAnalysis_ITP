 precaution of fitting a burglar alarm 
 to their property because they are    
 more vulnerable being in a lonely part
 of the countryside, with no street-   
 lighting. Double-glazing and special  
 locks on the doors are other safety   
 measures taken by householders in the 
 busier part,closer to{Headcorn village
 DOGS are the most popular pets, though
 some are working farm dogs. There are 
 Dpg training classes held in the      
 village,which many owners take advan- 
 tage of. HORSES are kept for riding by
 people with private stabling.The local
 farms have a number pets as well as   
 their stock animals - GOATS, DONKEYS, 
 and of course CATS to catch any vermin
 CATS are also popular pets with the   
 non-farming comunity, as are caged    
 birds like budgerigars.
