 A church has stood on this site for   
 over 800 years. The first churches    
 were made of wood. The present church 
 has a tower dating from 1533 but the  
 main part of the church was built in  
 the 1820's, with parts added to it    
 later.                                
 SAXON FONT - the font was returned to 
 the church in the 1880's. It had a    
 cover at one time to prevent people   
 stealing the holy water.              
 STOCKS - the old stocks outside the   
 church were erected in 1902 but not on
 the original site.                    
 CHEST - An old blackened chest in the 
 church holds parchments dating back to
 Henry IV. the chest dates back to     
 1666.                                 
 CHURCH RECORDS - date back to 1600's.
