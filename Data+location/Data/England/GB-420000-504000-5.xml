		<title>05The Post Office</title>
		<content> The history of the Post Office started
 a long time ago. It used to be in a   
 cottage across the road from its      
 present site. The present day building
 was erected in 1872.                  
 The post office has changed quite a   
 lot. It is now twice as big as it ever
 was and serves a lot more customers.  
 We think that running it must be very 
 hard work.                            
                                       
{Mr King}is the{present owner}of this  
{combined shop and post office,}he     
 works 13 hours each weekday. It would 
 be a great shame if ever the post     
 office had to close because it helps  
 to characterise our village,{provides 
{employment} as  well  as  being  an   
{essential service} and  is  also  an  
 excellent general store.
