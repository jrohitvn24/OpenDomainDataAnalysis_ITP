		<content>   The village owes its reputation for 
 being rather sleepy to a by-pass built
 in the 1930's. A delightful village   
 green slopes up towards the church and
 a line of cottages in mellow stone    
 which give the village centre the     
 appearance of somewhere in the        
{Cotswolds.}There is also a fine       
 selection of specimen trees; one an   
 Oak dates back to{Queen Victoria's    
 Coronation.                           
   Unfortunately, some of the names of 
 roads have been changed over the      
 years.{"The Gravel", "Sheep Walk Hill"
 and{"Flannel Row"}now only exist in   
 the minds of village patriots.        
   The village has witnessed a recent  
 growth with the advent of 2 housing   
 estates. The houses lie on meadow land
 and the site of a{fish pond}and key   
 hole shaped{sheep dip.}Salient        
 reminders of the past.                </content>
