		<title>10LOCAL INHABITANTS</title>
		<content> In the past,the families of local     
 inhabitants would have lived here for 
 generations,but now the ratio of      
 "natives" to "comers_in" is about     
 50:50.The attraction of beautiful     
 scenery,individual houses,peace &amp;     
 lower rates have drawn people from the
 town to the country.With the advent of
 mechanisation,farms employed fewer    
 men,cottages became empty &amp; were      
 quickly bought &amp; modernised by        
 "townies".Many locals now have jobs in
 or near Sheffield &amp; also keep a few   
 animals to supplement their income.   
 They enjoy living in the country &amp; are
 glad to return after a day at work.   
 They dislike the traffic &amp; noise of   
 the city.Very few want any changes to 
 their area except perhaps to have     
 mains drains!
