		<content>  The oldest part of the town is       
 dominated by terraced housing with    
 slate roofs.The streets following the 
 line of the beach are also mainly     
 terraced,although the houses are      
 fairly large and often of 3 storeys.  
 Development has been rather hotch     
 potch.The areas containing most of the
 detached houses are on the outskirts  
 of the town on 3 newly developed      
 estates,which give excellent views    
 over the golf course or open          
 agricultural land.These estates       
 contain a mixture of houses,chalet    
 bungalows and bungalows,both detached 
 and semi-detached.Much of the housing 
 is in private hands but there are 3   
 council estates,the largest containing
 160 houses.Included within these      
 estates are homes for the elderly,    
 several of which are undergoing       
 modernisation.                        </content>
