 Apart from the shops the main feature 
 of the Promenade is the Pier. It was  
 built in the 1850's by The Ulverston  
 and Lancaster Railway company to      
 replace an earlier wooden structure   
 when the construction of the railway  
 viaduct across the estuary prevented  
 ships from reaching the port of       
 Milnthorpe. After storm damage in the 
 late 1930's it was repaired by the    
 London, Midland and Scottish Railway  
 Company. It was sold to Arnside       
 Parish Council by British Rail for    
 Â£100 in 1964.                         
 A storm in January 1983 destroyed the 
 causeway which was rebuilt by public  
 subscription at a cost of Â£25000.
