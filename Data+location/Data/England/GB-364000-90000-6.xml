		<content>}  There is a single-track railway     
 running through our area. It is a main
 line from Weymouth to Yeovil. It is   
 part of the Great Western line and has
 always been threatened with closure.  
   At this time of the year the summer 
 excursions are run from Bristol,      
 Birmingham and the Midlands to        
 Weymouth so it looks busy but for the 
 rest of the year, not many people use 
 it.                                   
   The line skirts the villages of     
 Bradford Peverell &amp; Charminster and   
 follows an embankment crossing the    
 River Frome at places. There is a long
 tunnel cut through the chalk which    
 takes the line through Poundbury into 
 Dorchester West station which is now  
 unmanned, just a few years ago it used
 to be a busy station.
