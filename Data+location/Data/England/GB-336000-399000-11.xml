		<content> In this area there is not much        
 commercial entertainment. There is one
 cinema, no theatres and no night      
 clubs.  There are several private     
 clubs which do have live              
 entertainment, such as pop groups ,   
 comedians and musicians.  Besides     
 these there are lots of amateur       
 societies giving performances in      
 church halls and community centres.   
 The Tithebarn at Melling is such a    
 centre and is aided by the Arts       
 Council, som many atalented artists of
 repute are able to bring the theatre  
 and concert hall tothe district.      
 There are many public houses in the   
 area in a variety of styles from the  
 ancient sandstone of Bootle Arms to   
 ultra modern Alt Park Hotel.  There   
 are two or three small restaurants.   
 Most local people rely on Liverpool or
 Southport for entertainment.          </content>
