		<title>12TOADSMOOR WOOD</title>
		<content> The Toadsmoor Valley is heavily wooded
 with deciduous trees.  Some of the    
 woods are owned privately and some by 
 the Forestry Commission.  Beech grows 
 best in the area. The foresters cut   
 out ash and sycamore because they are 
 not needed.  After about fifteen years
 beech saplings are thinned for space  
 and are used for firewood.  They want 
 no side branches so they cut them off 
 or use specially selected seeds.  Dead
 leaves and twigs are left for compost.
 The big trees are felled at about one 
 hundred years and sold for furniture  
 at about two hundred pounds each.  If 
 they grow any silver birch they don't 
 fell them because they look nice.     
 Although elm was not grown widely     
 locally Dutch Elm Disease has now     
 killed all of them. The wood has a    
 lake called Toadsmoor Lake. It has    
 been known to freeze over in winter.  </content>
