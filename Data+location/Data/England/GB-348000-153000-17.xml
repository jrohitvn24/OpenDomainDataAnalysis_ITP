		<title>17LONGWOOD NATURE RESERVE</title>
		<content>  This Nature reserve is owned by the{ 
{Bristol Waterworks Company}but leased 
 to the Somerset Trust For Nature      
 Conservation (STNC).                  
  Longwood has a nature trial &amp; many   
 distinctive flowers including wild    
 garlic,bluebells, orchids &amp; tooth     
 wort. It is an important area of      
 deciduous woodland and careful        
 management is restoring its natural   
 vegetation.                           
  Foxes, badgers, squirrels &amp; many     
 birds are found in large numbers.     
 Longwood is also distinctive for its  
 caves. A stream flowing through the   
 valley disappears into a swallet      
 leading to a large cave system_       
 Longwood/August Hole. Another         
 spectacular cave_ the 170 metres deep 
 Rhino Rift_is also found in this      
 valley. Conservation also extends     
 underground_to protect formations.    </content>
