		<content> The area is rich in tourism. There are
 provisions for caravans and tents at  
 some farms.                           
 The area is very popular with car     
 owners who are able to drive around on
 the many country roads and admire the 
 beautiful countryside. There are many 
 public footpaths which criss-cross the
 moorland and these are used by walkers
 and ramblers.                         
 The North York Moors National Park has
 a nature trail called The May Beck    
 Trail which meanders its way through  
 the forest taking in much wild life.  
 The area is onlu five miles from      
 Whitby and twenty miles from          
 Scarborough, the largest holiday      
 resort on the Yorkshire Coast.        
 Tourists travel from Whitby and       
 Scarborough mainly during the summer  
 months, to use the tourist facilities 
 provided by the area.                 </content>
