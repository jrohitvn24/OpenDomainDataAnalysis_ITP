		<title>04GREENMILE FARM, RANBY</title>
		<content>   Situated in the south-east quadrant 
 of the block (664,819) this farm      
 illustrates one system by which       
 farmers have adapted to constantly    
 changing conditions.                  
   The farm is of approximately 700    
 acres and employs 17 staff. The       
 principal crops are barley, wheat,    
 peas and sugar beet. To combat the    
 lack of fertility the farmer keeps    
 over 3000 pigs, of which the manure is
 ploughed back into the soil.          
   Large quantities of soft fruit are  
 grown which occupies most of the      
 workforce. Much of the field work is  
 now done by machine for which a full  
 time mechanic is employed.            
   Several acres are used for growing  
 trees which are used to create        
 windbreaks and are sold to local      
 authorities for parks and gardens.
