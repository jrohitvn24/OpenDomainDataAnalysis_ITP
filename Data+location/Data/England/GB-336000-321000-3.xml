		<title>03RTUYTON XI TOWNS CHURCH</title>
		<content>{Ruyton XI Towns Church}was built in   
 1140 so that means it is 845 years    
 old.The graveyard is as old as the    
 church. There are about 900 people in 
 the parish. There are 40-50 people in 
 the congregation.                     
 The church architecture is mostly     
 Norman. The reredos shows S. John the 
 Baptist to whom the church is         
 dedicated.                            
 The existing registers of the church  
 date from 1719 as the earlier ones    
 were destroyed by fire.               
 In 1860 a Methodist chapel was built  
 for 180 sittings but has now been     
 demolished. A Congregational chapel   
 was built in 1883 with 250 sittings   
 and this chapel is still in use today 
 although the attendance is very       
 small.
