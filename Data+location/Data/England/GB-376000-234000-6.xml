		<content> The area consists of a hillside with  
 cottages and larger houses, the land  
 falling away from the crest of Chase  
 End Hill towards the Severn Valley.   
 There is no centre of population and  
 so the{crafts}and{hobbies}are those   
 which are completed in homes or in    
 loosely formed groups covering several
 interests. The most popular{hobby}is  
{landscape painting,}closely followed  
 by{spinning and weaving}the local     
 fleece. This is dyed with vegetable   
 dyes found in the fields and          
 hedgerows. This yarn is knitted or    
 crocheted into garments or woven into 
 rugs. A number of local people        
 embroider on fine linen. We have an   
 expert lacemaker who has been pursuing
 her craft for many years, and a lady  
 who presses local flowers and leaves  
 and makes them into attractive        
 pictures, which she sells.            </content>
