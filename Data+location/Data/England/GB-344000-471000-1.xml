		<content>  This Eastern verge of Morecambe Bay  
 covers a small area of coastline      
 within the boundary of Silverdale     
 village. It is within a Designated    
 Area Of Outstanding Natural Beauty.   
  It is sparsely populated in three    
 small groups of houses and cottages.  
  There is a small amount of farmland  
 used for grazing and a disused quarry 
 now used as a sheep run with long     
 feeding troughs. These are used twice 
 monthly when the high tides deprive   
 the sheep of grazing on the salt      
 marshes.                              
  The coastline varies from a gentle   
 slope on the Eastern side to steeply  
 sloping cliffs of broken rock up to 15
 metres high. On the Western side of   
 the peninsula is a break in the cliffs
 called The Cows Mouth which was used  
 by drovers bringing cattle across the 
 Kent Estuary.                         </content>
