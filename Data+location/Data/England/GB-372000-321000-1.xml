		<content>   THE MAIN AIMS OF OUR SURVEY WERE TO 
 STUDY SAMPLE AREAS OF WOODLAND AND    
 HEDGEROWS IN THE GRID SQUARES GIVEN.  
   SECTIONS OF WOODLAND WERE FOUND IN  
 GRID SQUARES 03730323 03740323        
 03720322 03730322 03740322 03720321   
 AND 03730321. PULESTON COMMON WAS THE 
 FIRST AREA WE VISITED IN GRID SQUARE  
 03730323. THE MAP SHOWS MIXED WOODLAND
 BUT THE TREES WE SAW WERE ALL         
 DECIDUOUS. THERE WERE SIGNS THAT IT   
 WAS NOT ALL NATURAL WOODLAND AS THERE 
 WERE A FEW OPEN SPACES WITH TREE      
 STUMPS WHERE THE TREES HAD BEEN       
 FELLED.                               
   THERE WERE FOUR CANOPY LAYERS. THE  
 TALLEST LAYER CONSISTED OF OLD BEECH  
 AND OAK TREES. AT ABOUT FOUR METRES   
 ROWAN AND SILVER BIRCH MADE THE SECOND
 CANOPY LAYER. THE THIRD LAYER INCLUDED
 BRAMBLES AND FERNS AS WELL AS NETTLES 
 AND TALLER GRASSES.THE GROUND LAYER   </content>
