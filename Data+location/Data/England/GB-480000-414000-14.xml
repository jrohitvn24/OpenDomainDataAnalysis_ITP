 years. She took them until she left   
 school.                               
        If you were a lady you couldn't
 teach if you married. The children    
 walked about 1mile to school. Mrs.    
 Holkan  used to make her own butter   
 which the farm helpers churned  for   
 her.

 cows and about 100 bullocks.They grew 
 potatoes,barley and sugar beet.They   
 grow cereals now.Farming has changed  
 completely.Mrs Holkan has a spade that
 dug the first bit of earth of the
