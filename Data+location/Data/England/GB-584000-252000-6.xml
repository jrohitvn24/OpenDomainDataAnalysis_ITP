		<title>06Churches in Lawshall Area.</title>
		<content>In this area we have 3 places of       
Worship. In Lawshall village is All    
Saints Parish Church, which was record-
ed in the Domesday Book of 1086,       
althoughwe cannot be certain it was the
same building as the earliest we can   
date it is the Early English Period    
1166-1266. At present we are without an
incumbent due to the retirement of the 
Rector in June 1984,but the Parish has 
been looked after by the Rector-in-    
Charge of the adjoining Parish, but in 
September 1985 a new Curate-in-Charge  
will be taking up residence in the     
rectory.The church is now in a poor    
state of repair,the tower needs 30,000 
pounds to repair it,and many fund rais-
ing events are taking place at present.
Most recently a Flower Festival in July
The church was beautifully decorated   
with flowers,each display portraying a 
village craft or trade.                </content>
