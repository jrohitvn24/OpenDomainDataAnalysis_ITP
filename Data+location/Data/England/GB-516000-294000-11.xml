		<title>11New Orton Estates</title>
		<content>   The new Ortons have come about as a 
 result of the New Towns Act of        
 Parliament in the mid 1960's and this 
 designated Peterborough a New town and
 charged it with providing housing,    
 industry and facilities for those who 
 wished to move out of London.   The   
 first of the new Peterborough         
 Townships was Bretton, and Orton was  
 the second.  Orton is designed round  
 five neighbourhoods, each having a    
 school, shops and a pub.   The housing
 is a mixture of privately built and   
 owned houses and those built by the   
 Development Corporation.   The houses 
 are deliberately desinged to be       
 different heights and sizes alongside 
 each other the make the effect        
 interesting - like an old village.    
 Many are built round courts to        
 encourage community feeling. Thousands
 of trees and shrubs have been planted.</content>
