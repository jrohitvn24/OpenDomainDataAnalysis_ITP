		<title>17A VILLAGE MUM'S DAY - 5</title>
		<content>  At 8 p.m. I am mask making to help   
 with our school play. I have to get a 
 babysitter as my husband is away on a 
 course. I leave the children safely in
 the hands of Kathryn, my next door    
 neighbour and set off for the home of 
 the producer. The mask making goes    
 well and my cardboard box and papier  
 mache IS looking like an owl. I hope  
 the lad who will be wearing it will be
 happy. I leave Marion and Mike picking
 up feathers from their kitchen floor  
 and go home at 11 o'clock.            
  I pay the babysitter and make myself 
 a cup of tea. The girls are cosy in   
 their beds with their teddies at their
 sides. I go to bed and drink my tea - 
 and have another five minutes to      
 myself, like I did at the beginning of
 my long day early this morning.       
  Goodnight!
