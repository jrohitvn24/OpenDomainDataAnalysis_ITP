 We divide our flock into two groups,  
 the first lamb in January to produce  
 lamb for the Easter market. The second
 group is March. The breed used are    
 Scotch half bred and Mule ewes mated  
 mainly with Suffolk and Hampshire     
 rams. The best lambs are gradually    
 fattened on grass, kale and turnips   
 for marketing throughout the rest of  
 the year.                             
                                       
 We would like our sheep to have twin  
 lambs every year and the nearer we are
 to this target the more economic lamb 
 production becomes. The sheep are     
 sheared once a year in June and the   
 wool is sold to the Wool Marketing    
 Board, where it is graded and used for
 clothing, carpets etc. An average     
 fleece weighs 3.5 kilograms. By Serena</content>
