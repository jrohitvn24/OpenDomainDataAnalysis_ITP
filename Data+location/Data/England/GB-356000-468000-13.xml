		<content>Mr and Mrs Field run the village Post  
Office. Although they live in one of   
the neighbouring villages they have    
become part of Hornby. They provide an 
important service for which many of the
villagers are grateful; particularly   
the elderly, those with very young     
children and those without transport.  
The next Post Office is 7 km away.     
Because of the nature of their work    
they are often the first to know of new
arrivals to, and departures from, the  
village. The Post Office is one of the 
focal points of the village and much   
news is exchanged here.                
Hornby sees many tourists passing      
through but of those who stop quite a  
few call in at the Post Office, either 
to buy post cards, refreshments,etc. or
to obtain information concerning       
routes, local events, accomodation and 
so on.                                 </content>
