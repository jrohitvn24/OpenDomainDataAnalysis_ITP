 This originated from the annual Barrow
 Race which was held as part of the    
 local Wakes Week Celebration. In 1977 
 it was decided to hold a gala to      
 celebrate the Queen's Silver Jubilee  
 and revive the custom of choosing a   
 Queen and attendants.                 
                                       
{May Celebrations.}                    
 In 1984 children from Anstey Latimer  
 School made Leicestershire May Crosses
 to celebrate May Day. In 1985 this was
 turned into a May Celebration         
 throughout the village,with the       
{Anstey Morris Men and Royal Chalfont  
{Garland Dancers}and local children,   
 processing the{May Crosses and Jack o'
{the Green.}It is hoped,that like the  
 gala,this will become an annual       
 event.
