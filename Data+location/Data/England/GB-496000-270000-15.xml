		<title>15MR CYRIL PUTT-AN INTERVIEW</title>
		<content> Mr Cyril Putt has lived in Raunds for 
 sixty five years.He said:"The shoe    
 trade industry has decreased to less  
 than twenty five percent.Some of the  
 industries have completely            
 disappeared,eg factories like Adams   
 Brothers which once had three hundred 
 people,Grave Stokes,St.Crispins,      
 Harrells,James Chambers Hill Builders,
 E.W Chambers and Owen Smiths have     
 completely vanished.The lack of       
 council houses has increased over the 
 last twenty years.There have been more
 private houses in their place.The lack
 of council houses means there is a    
 lack of back yards".We asked him if he
 prefered the old or the new houses,and
 he said that he prefered the old      
 houses.When asked about the youth in  
 Raunds he said"There's always been the
 good and bad children.They need some- 
 where to keep them off the streets."  </content>
