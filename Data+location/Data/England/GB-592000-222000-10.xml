		<content>  The warm summers are well suited to  
 the production of{soft fruit}and      
 although early crops need{protection  
 with plastic clotches and wind breaks,
 they may arrive up to a month ahead of
 the main crop.                        
  A portion of the early crops are     
 picked for{whole sale markets,}the    
 rest is given over to retail sale in  
 the form of{"pick your own".}The main 
 crop is{strawberries}which become     
 available from July to September but  
 most soft fruits as well as{orchard   
{fruits,}are available in season.      
  Recently there has been a move       
 to include{vegetables}such as         
 beans,potatoes and even sweetcorn in  
 the rotation. By making the public do 
 the harvesting labour costs are       
 reduced.
