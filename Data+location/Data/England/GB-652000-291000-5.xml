  A major development is planned for   
Lowestoft in the town centre next to   
the library. There will be offices on  
higher floors and entertainment below. 
British Home Stores will be extending  
their shop and Bejam, Mothercare and   
Superdrug are going to have stores     
there. The centre is going to be called
the Britten centre after the composer  
who was born in Lowestoft.             
                                       
 There has recently been an argument   
over whether there should be a gipsy   
site on Kirkley Ham. Local people      
signed a petition against it. Some     
families started camping but have been 
moved on and the plan has been shelved.
