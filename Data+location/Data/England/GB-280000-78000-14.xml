		<content> One of the clubs in Bovey Tracey for  
 boys aged 8 to 10 years, is the Cub   
 scouts.In cubs, at the beginning, we  
 have to work for a badge.If you       
 wanted your artist badge you would    
 have to draw a picture. You have to   
 get three arrows, the bronze arrow,   
 siver arrow, and the gold arrow. At   
 the age of 10\ cubs go up to scouts.  
 This is for boys up to the age of 16  
 yrs. The scouts have more adventures. 
 They go camping, absailing, rock      
 climbing and many other activities.   
 Other clubs include a youth club at   
 Hennock, and in Bovey Tracey, the Boys
 Brigade, Guides and Brownies, and     
 Tracey Troopers.There are also many   
 clubs for adults. The Rotary club,    
 Bovey Belles(dancers),Bovey Wives,    
 Mother's Union,Rotaract,and The       
 Conservative Club etc.
