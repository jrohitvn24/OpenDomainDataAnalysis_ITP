		<content>   Our school is built right in the    
 centre of a densely populated housing 
 estate. It was much appreciated then, 
 by local residents, when last year    
 every class in the school participated
 in a planting exercise to create a    
 long herbaceous border around two     
 sides of the playground.              
   At the same time we began turning a 
 wild area of a couple of acres within 
 our grounds into a nature area,       
 complete with a pond. This is the only
 area of its kind in the entire estate,
 Goldsworth Park (Europe's largest).   
 Some children have cleared much of the
 ground beneath the trees, creating a  
 network of paths for the rest of the  
 pupils. Frogs and many insects have   
 come to live in our pond, while a vast
 variety of flowers has been discovered
 including, for the first time in this 
 area, orchids.                        </content>
