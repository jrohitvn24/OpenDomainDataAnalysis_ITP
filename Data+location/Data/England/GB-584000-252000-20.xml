		<title>20Work in the Lawshall Area</title>
		<content>In our area,apart from farms,pubs,shops
and schools,there are some small busin-
esses employing a few local people.A   
wood yard,selling fire logs from trees 
felled locally,a wood carver,a local   
handyman/gardener,a car repair workshop
a small business restoring vintage cars
There are 4 separate builders  and a   
few clerical workers with offices at   
home.Several villagers grow vegetables 
and sell at their garden gate,it is    
quite common to see a table laden with 
fresh garden produce,to serve yourself 
and leave the money in a tin. The re-  
mainder of the working population      
travel out of the area for employment  
using their own transport or the works 
bus service.                           
The facts and information within have  
been painstakingly prepared by a small 
group of Parents, Friends and Children 
of Lawshall Primary School, Suffolk.   </content>
