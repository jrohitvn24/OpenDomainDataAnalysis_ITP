		<title>17Garden Birds in Fulford</title>
		<content> House sparrows inhabit different areas
 around Fulford, from farmland to      
 heathland but its normal home is near 
 the city where it can find food in    
 harsh winters. Starlings are common in
 Fulford. Flocks of them greedily eat  
 almost anything but their favourite   
 foods are leather jackets. they nest  
 in trees, bushes and hedgerows. Black-
 birds feed on worms, beetles and other
 invertebrates. They nest in trees and 
 hedges. Robins are very tame in the   
 gardens of Fulford. They are very     
 protective over their territory, often
 nesting in dense undergrowth or       
 bushes. Bluetits are clever birds who 
 have learnt to take milk bottle tops  
 off to get at the cream. Their        
 favourite nest sites are hollow trees 
 but so many trees have been felled    
 that they have taken to nesting in    
 artificial nest boxes.                </content>
