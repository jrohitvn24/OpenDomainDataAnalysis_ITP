		<title>02 Beck Row Village</title>
		<content>  We discovered that the name Beck is  
Scandinavian and so was probably named 
by the Vikings when they landed on high
ground having rowed their boats from   
The Wash.                              
  We managed to follow the dried up    
course of The Beck or stream as far as 
{Beck House}, over part of The Close-an
area of special interest,as it was part
of the grounds of {Aspal Hall}. One    
resident told us that in I930 there    
were less than 100 houses and water was
drawn from wells.  In 1934 the         
Waterworks was supplying water to most 
houses. Beck Row started to expand when
the R.A.F.opened the airfield and there
are now over 1,000 houses in the       
village. Amenities include a {Village  
Hall},{Post Office},{Primary School},  
2 {Churches},3 food shops,furniture    
shop,antiques shop,2 hotels,and 2      
public houses.                         </content>
