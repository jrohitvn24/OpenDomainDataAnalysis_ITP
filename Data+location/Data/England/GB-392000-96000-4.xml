		<title>04Henbury House</title>
		<content>    Built in the reign of{George III,  
 in the second half of the 18th        
 century, this house has in the last   
 five years been{rescued from          
{deriliction.}There are twelve acres of
 gardens and parkland with some fine   
 lime trees, and a large{walled garden.
 The plan was to transform the house   
 into a{hotel and restaurant}and the   
 Old Kitchens opened as a restaurant   
 under that name. This was forced to   
 close due to financial difficulties   
 and the house has been sold. The new  
 owners hope to turn the range of      
 buildings around the courtyard into a 
 number of{holiday cottages}and to     
 build a{leisure centre}with swimming  
 pool and tennis courts.               
    This house is off the main A31     
 Wimborne to Bere Regis road just east 
 of Roundhouse Roundabout.
