		<title>14Transport in Appleby</title>
		<content>    Robinson's is the only bus company 
 in Appleby.It has about 2 buses and   
 nine coaches.They do school bus runs  
 for Appleby Grammar School and Appleby
 Primary School and round the town.    
 They sometimes go abroad to           
 Switzerland,France and other          
 places.They sometimes go to Blackpool 
 and other places all over England     
 doing special holiday tours.There is  
 a bus to Penrith on Tuesdays.My       
 Grandad John Lance Elliott owns the   
 company and my dad Philip Robinson    
 Elliott drives the buses with other   
 drivers.                              
    We have a special railway station  
 at Appleby because it is on the       
 Carlisle to Settle railway line which 
 is danger of being closed down.       
 Sometimes steam trains run on our line
 and then Appleby Station is very busy.
