		<content> During the recent Miners Strike, it   
 was reported that about 30 miners     
 lived in the Manor/Woodthorpe Areas.  
     There is plenty of evidence around
 to show that mining used to take place
 in this area. In fact, many people dig
 coal or shale in their garden, but not
 enough to use as fuel.                
     There are several "pit-hills", and
 disused mineshafts have caused one or 
 two near-accidents.                   
     There used to be many pits in this
 area, and local records show that many
 miners used to live here.             
     Woodthorpe Colliery closed in     
 1921, after 70 years working, and up  
 to 300 men were employed there.       
     It is now against the law to burn 
 coal in this area. It was made a      
 Smokeless Zone to make the area       
 cleaner and healthier.
