 and barley. They have got 98 beast and
 143 sheep. The farm covers  240 acres.
 They feed the beast with ground oats, 
 and barley,hay and straw. They go to  
 Melton cattle market on Tuesdays and  
 sometimes on  Fridays, as well as     
 Leicester cattle market. The hay      
 bales we use are small.They buy all of
 the beast and sheep at Melton market  
  and sell their lambs there..{by Chris
