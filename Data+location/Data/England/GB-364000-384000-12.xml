		<title>12A DAY IN MY LIFE - MORNING</title>
		<content> I awake on a sunny Thursday morning,  
 my mother is already preparing for a  
 long day looking after our two babies.
 I grope for my watch and as usual its 
 time to get up, 8am.  My sister is now
 using the bathroom, I haven't got much
 chance of going in there for half an  
 hour.  I roll out of bed and dress in 
 my school uniform.  Picking up my bag,
 I dash down stairs and eat a breakfast
 of cereal and toast.  Then after      
 saying my goodbyes, I'm off to school.
 I meet with my friend and we set off  
 down the canal bank towards Lymm High 
 School.  The lessons are enjoyable on 
 Thursday, games, Maths and Science.   
 Now comes lunchtime, our lunches are  
 self-service and show a range of foods
 from pizza to grapefruit.             
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
