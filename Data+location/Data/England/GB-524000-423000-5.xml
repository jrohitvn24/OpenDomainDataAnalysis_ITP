		<content> Daily routine starts in most homes    
 between 6.0am and 7.0am, breakfast and
 tea (evening meal) are usually shared 
 by all the family. After breakfast the
 children go to school, by bus in this 
 area and dad goes to work, leaving mum
 at home. Increasingly more women are  
 working, if the woman does work and   
 time for preparing food is short, a   
 meal may be taken from the deep       
 freezer and cooked in a micro-wave    
 oven. Although where time permits     
 fresh fruit, vegetables, meat and fish
 will be traditionally cooked. Children
 finish school by 4.0pm and men are    
 home by 6.0pm, occasionally families  
 will go out in an evening, children to
 Youth clubs of disco's and parents may
 go to a public house or club. It is   
 still largely regarded as the womans  
 job to look after the home and the    
 mans to provide money for its upkeep. </content>
