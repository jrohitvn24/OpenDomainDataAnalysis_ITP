old. I get up at half past seven.I go  
into the bathroom and wash my hands and
face,then I go to my bedroom and get   
dressed. I go downstairs, let Jim our  
dog outside,then I have a breakfast of 
cornflakes and toast.At halfpast eight 
we walk to school,which takes about ten
minutes and which starts at nine.The   
main lessons are usually English,Maths,
History,R.E.and Geography.At halfpast  
three we go home. I usually change into
trousers and have something to eat and 
drink,then I go out to play.At six     
oclock we have dinner. Afterwards I do 
my piano practice. At halfpast seven I 
get undressed washed and ready for bed 
and then go downstairs and watch       
televison or read a book for a while.
