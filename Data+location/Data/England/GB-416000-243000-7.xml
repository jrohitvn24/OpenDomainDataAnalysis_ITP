		<content> Views of{Mr W Brain,}local resident.  
 It was a big market gardening area    
 where thousands of cauliflowers were  
 grown.Horses were used on the land as 
 well as tractors.                     
 An older resident{Mrs Elizabeth       
{Fairfax.}                             
 There are more strangers around now.  
 There was a lot less traffic then and 
 it went a lot slower.Mickleton had a  
 population of 680 then.The centre of  
 the village is much less pretty than  
 it was.It used to have iron railings  
 and bushes and more countryside.There 
 are more shops now.The Post Office    
 used to be at a house called Wycombe. 
 There were more public houses.Three-  
 Ways Hotel used to be a private house 
 with a big garden behind a stone wall.
 Some of the old cottages have been    
 pulled down.
