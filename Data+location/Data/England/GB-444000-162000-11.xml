 I surveyed three classes and found    
 that only 10 children were born in    
 Newbury.Nearly one third of the       
 children surveyed had moved in the    
 last year,many of them from Thatcham  
 where there is a lot of new building  
 and people think it is getting too    
 crowed.Some people moved  within      
 Newbury from other parts of Berkshire 
 but some came from further away.Last  
 year 147 children moved into our area 
 and started our school and 16 moved   
 away.Out of a class of 33 only 3      
 children had no relations in          
 Newbury.19 had Aunts and Uncles living
 locally and 1 Chinese girl had all 30 
 ofher relations living in Wash        
 Common.From last September 29 rising  
 five year olds started our school.
