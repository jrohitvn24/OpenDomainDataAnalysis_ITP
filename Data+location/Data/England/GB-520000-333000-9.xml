		<title>09QUADRING PRIMARY SCHOOL</title>
		<content> Quadring Cowley and Brown's Primary   
 School dates from the 1720's. It was  
 set up with rent from land left by two
 local land owners. The school still   
 receives money from this source at the
 discretion of the Charity Trustees.   
      Initially it was a boarding      
 school, part of the original building 
 is still standing, but now it is a two
 teacher primary school with           
 approximately 46 children.            
      Most of the pupils live in       
 Quadring but some travel by car from  
 Donington. Those from the village     
 either walk or cycle along a footpath 
 which runs directly from the village  
 to the school.                        
      On leaving this school children  
 either go to the secondary school in  
 Donington or Grammar or High in       
 Spalding.
