		<title>13Amenities in Hauxton</title>
		<content>  Hauxton Post Office had notices with 
 information for most age groups, such 
 as a toddler group, youth discos      
 as well as a youth club.              
                                       
  There was only one village shop and  
 the church wasn't the central focus,  
 as it was on the outskirts of the     
 village, on the way to Cambridge. It  
 was built in the fourteenth century   
 out of stone. It has a small font, an 
 organ, choir stalls and wooden pews.  
  There is also a sunday school and    
 fetes, bazaars etc. are also held     
 there.
