		<content> THERE IS A WIDE RANGE OF GOOD QUALITY 
 SHOPS IN OVERTON.THE COMMUNITY CAR    
 PARK SHOULD BE BETTER CONTROLLED.     
 I THINK THAT BRIDGE STREET SHOULD BE  
 MADE INTO A ONE WAY STREET BECAUSE IT 
 IS TOO NARROW.THERE IS A GOOD BUS     
 TIME-TABLE. THERE ARE A WIDE RANGE    
 OF SPORTS PLAYED IN OVERTON INCLUDING 
 SWIMMING AND LOTS MORE.THE DOCTOR'S   
 SURGERY IS IN A GOOD POSITION  FOR    
 PEOPLE IN OVERTON. BUT FOR OLD PEOPLE 
 AND PEOPLE WHO DO NOT HAVE A CAR AND  
 LIVE RIGHT OUT OF OVERTON TRANSPORT IS
 A PROBLEM. THE CHEMIST IS QUITE NEAR  
 THE DOCTORS SURGERY AND HAS NEARLY ALL
 THE MEDICINE YOU WANT.                
 THE YOUTH HOSTEL IN OVERTON IS IN A   
 GOOD PLACE.THE OLD INFANT SCHOOL HAS  
 BEEN MADE INTO A COMMUNITY CENTRE-GOOD
 FOR THE COMMUNITY BUT THE INFANTS HAVE
 FURTHER TO GO TO SCHOOL.
