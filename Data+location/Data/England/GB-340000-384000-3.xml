		<title>03Past And Present In Woolton</title>
		<content>   The centre of our area is Woolton   
{village}which has an entry in the     
 Domesday Book! Many of the buildings  
 are hundreds of years old. Woolton    
 Hall, a Georgian Manor House, is now a
 licensed restaurant. The village fete 
 is still an annual affair and well    
 supported by the residents.           
   The sandstone from the{quarry}was   
 used in the building of Liverpool     
 Anglican{Cathedral}and all the Woolton
 churches. Much of the area is wide    
 open spaces of parkland used as       
 recreation grounds. There are also two
 golf courses - Allerton Municipal Golf
 Course and Woolton Golf Club.         
   Woolton village is a busy shopping  
 area. In 1982 Sainsbury's new shopping
 precinct was opened here. Some small  
 shops have been put out of business   
 because of this.
