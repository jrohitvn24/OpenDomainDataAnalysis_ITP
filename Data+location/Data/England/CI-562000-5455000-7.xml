		<content> The only church in the area is St.    
 John's Parish Church which is well    
 situated in the "centre" of the       
 Parish. It was{built}in the 12th.     
 century but has been added to many    
 times since.                          
                                       
 It is a very beautiful building       
 constructed in pink granite with a    
 spire which houses a full peal of     
{bells.}These were restored and re-hung
 during the late 1970's.               
                                       
 Anglican{Services}take place every    
 Sunday, often with a family service in
 the morning and evensong later in the 
 day.                                  
                                       
 Many of the local children sing in the
{choir}which practices once a week and 
 a{Sunday School}meets weekly, staffed 
 by lay volunteers.                    </content>
