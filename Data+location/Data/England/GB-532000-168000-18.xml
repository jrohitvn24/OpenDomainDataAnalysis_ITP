		<content> will be coming home. The cricket      
 finishes. Then my mum comes through   
 the door, puts the bags down, and     
 makes a cup of tea. Meanwhile i'm     
 playing in the playground. At quarter 
 to two my dad leaves for work. My mum 
 is doing the ironing. At quarter to   
 three my mum goes to work at Edenham. 
 At half past three after a long and   
 tiring day, we go home to our nan's   
 house.                                
   Meanwhile my mum is washing the     
 floors, and my is delivering letters. 
 At my nan's i'm having my tea. At     
 quarter past six my mum comes around  
 and picks us up. At eight o'clock p.m.
 my dad comes home, then I go to bed   
 looking forward to                    
  SATURDAY.
