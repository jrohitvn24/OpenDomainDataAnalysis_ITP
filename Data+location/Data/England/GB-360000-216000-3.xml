     I go to Ruardean School. Ruardean 
 school is very old and has a nice view
 of Ruardean. We have acomputer and on 
 it we play "Spacex" which is a game   
 where you have to find parts of your  
 spaceship. We do Maths, English,      
 Science, History, Geography, Art,     
 Games. We watch T.V. three times a    
 week. We sometimes go for a walk and  
 for trips. We are going to the        
 Wilderness for three days. The        
 Wilderness is a schools activities    
 centre. The girls play netball and the
 boys play football. In the summer we  
 play rounders and non stop cricket and
 other games. In our yard we have a    
 netball court. We have a sports day   
 every summer and we have a parent's   
 sports evening every year.
