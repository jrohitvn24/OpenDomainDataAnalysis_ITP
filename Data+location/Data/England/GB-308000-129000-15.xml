 Pigs:                                 
                                       
 The shed contains a slatted floor to  
 ensure that the piglets avoid         
 infaction by rolling in their own     
 urine etc. The pigs have food and     
 water constantly available.

 Mr. Bramall enjoys his job. "I could  
 just about manage all this on my own,"
 he told us. "I do all my own building 
 and bookwork. It's a busy, hectic     
 existence but then it's the same for  
 everyone in farming these days, isn't 
 it?"
