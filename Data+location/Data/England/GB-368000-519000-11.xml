		<title>11Appleby Fire Station</title>
		<content>       Appleby fire station is in Holme
    Street.In the fire station yard    
    there is a big white tower shaped  
    like a letter T with hooks on.That 
    is used to clean the hoses out.    
    They have two fire engines and     
    a van.At Appleby the sub officer   
    is Mr.David Richardson and         
    there are twelve retained fire     
    men.That means they don't work     
    there all the time.They just       
    carry bleepers.When the bleeper    
    goes all the fire men hurry to     
    the fire station.Fire station      
    night is on Monday when they       
    have meetings,check the equipment  
    and train.The next nearest fire    
    stations are at Shap,Kirkby Stephen
    and Penrith.Fire men also go to    
    road accidents,and floods.But most 
    of the things are fires.
