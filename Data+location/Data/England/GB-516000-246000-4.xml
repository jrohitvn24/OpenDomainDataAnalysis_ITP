		<content> In 1862, the London &amp; North Western   
 Railway opened an extension of their  
 Bletchley to Bedford line via Sandy to
 Cambridge, using Captain Peel's       
 railway. A branch from Sandy had been 
 proposed by the G.N.R. in 1850 to run 
 to Bedford but opposition from other  
 railway companies forced them to      
 abandon the idea.                     
 When it did open, it became well-     
 known as the 'Universities Line,'     
 running as it did from Cambridge with 
 a connection at Bletchley on to       
 Oxford. The countryside through which 
 it passed was very lightly populated  
 and therefore, although it carried    
 some local market gardening produce,  
 it was not used by large numbers of   
 passengers.                           
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
