 cast and maintained by Mears and      
 Stainbeck now the Whitechapel Bell    
 Foundry in London.The Tower Captain   
 and Ringing Master is Mr P.M. Dawson. 
 He arranges the ringing,keeps the     
 bells and ropes in working order and  
 adjusts the clock as necessary.       
   The ringers,except for Mr. and Mrs. 
 Dawson who are "Surprise" ringers and 
 spend much of their spare time ringing
 in various parts of the country, are  
 "Plain Method" ringers.               
   Mr. and Mrs. Dawson were proud and  
 honoured to be invited to ring in the 
 quarter peal,rung half muffled on     
 Sunday 19th.May 1985 at Bradford      
 Cathedral in memory of the Bradford   
 City Fire victims.
