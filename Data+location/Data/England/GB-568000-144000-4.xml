		<title>04COLLIER STREET FETE.</title>
		<content>On the 8th.June 1985 we visited a fete 
at Claygate,Collier Street.The warm    
weather which melted the ice cream     
attracted 400 people.There were a      
number of stalls including rifle range,
doughnuts,tombola,death ride and raffle
tickets.The latter were sold at a pound
each which we thought was a high price 
but the prize was a holiday for two in 
Brighton.There was a "penny roll"stall 
and a Guide stall celebrating 75 years 
of Guiding.The funds from the fete were
going towards the church which was     
burnt in January.870 pounds was raised 
and this was made up to 1,000 pounds by
an anonymous donor after the church    
service the following Sunday.Last year 
the fete was much larger with          
helicopters and fairground rides but   
this did not make much profit even     
though 7,000 people went.
