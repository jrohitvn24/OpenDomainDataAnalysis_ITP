 On the north_facing scarp slope of the
 Chiltern Hills, Coombe Hill being the 
 highest point in the range, the       
 weather is cold rather than warm and  
 is subject to extremes. Snow lies long
 on the north slope in winter,while in 
 hot summers the chalky soil quickly   
 becomes hard_baked, and cracked. The  
 hills themselves often break up a     
 weather pattern; heavy rain may be    
 falling on the other side of the hills
 in High Wycombe or Marlow while the   
 north slope remains dry and rain free 
 and the rainfall continues in the Vale
 of Aylesbury 2mls away. It may also   
 happen the other way round. The steep 
 sided deep valleys, usually running   
 north/south and characteristic of the 
 area, are more sheltered from the     
 elements. They are on the whole water 
 free and are termed BOTTOMS locally   </content>
