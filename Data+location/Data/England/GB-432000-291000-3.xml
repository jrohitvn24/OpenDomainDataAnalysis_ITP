		<title>03Poor's Piece</title>
		<content>  There's a piece of land at the corner
 of Tuttle Hill and Mancetter Road     
 called{Poor's Piece,}so named because 
 it was set aside for the poor in the  
 early 19th century.Now it is part of a
 disused quarry surrounded by a fence. 
  To get into this land you have to go 
 through a car-park and down a steep   
 slope. It is a very nice place with a 
 lot of natural life around. There are 
 bushes and grass everywhere and lots  
 of{hawthorn}trees which provide places
 for a variety of birds to nest. By the
 side of a small pool there is a picnic
 table from where you can hear the     
 birds singing and enjoy the scenery.  
  Nearby on the{Coventry Canal}is      
{Boon's Wharf,}owned by{British        
{Waterways.}It was built so that stone 
 from the local quarry could be loaded 
 onto barges and sent all over the     
 country. Today it is disused.         </content>
