		<content>{Neil Horner writes -}My Dad is an A.A.
 Patrolman. He has to answer calls     
 from the roadside or from homes. If he
 can he repairs the vehicle, otherwise 
 he arranges recovery to a garage. It  
 is a 24hr service, 365 days a year.   
 The Island has a team of six breakdown
 patrols with one Inspector and two    
 ladies at the Newport Office. The work
 load varies greatly with the weather  
 and with traffic volume. Tourists make
 summer very busy. Heavy rain or severe
 winter weather will increase the calls
 for the Breakdown Service.            
 Mostly work is on popular models -    
 cars, vans or motor bikes. Sometimes a
 more exotic vehicle needs help.       
 Ignition failure is the most common   
 cause of breakdown but anything from  
 punctures to seized engines have to be
 dealt with ... including an increasing
 number of keys locked in cars!        </content>
