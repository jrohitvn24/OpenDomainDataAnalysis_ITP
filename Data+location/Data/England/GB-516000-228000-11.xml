		<title>11CHARLTON HAMLET, HITCHIN</title>
		<content>  {CHARLTON}is a picturesque hamlet of 
 23 houses(pop.approx.40)lying just    
 over 1 mile W of Hitchin town centre, 
 and sited on the River Hiz. This      
 attractive hamlet is one of Herts     
 small village showpieces. One of the  
 main attractions is the Windmill Pub  
 which was named pub of the year 1979. 
 It derives its name from a windmill   
 which used to stand near to the pub   
 until it was burnt down. The first    
 known tenants to run an 'ale house' in
 Charlton came from Finsbury Park and  
 sold corn and coal during the day and 
 ale at night from a covered wagon. The
 windmill is occasionally the venue for
 sword dancers from nearby Offley. Sir 
 Henry Bessemer was born in the house  
 adjacent to the pub in 1813. Bessemer 
 pioneered the large scale manufacture 
 of cheap steel. He was knighted in    
 1879.                                 </content>
