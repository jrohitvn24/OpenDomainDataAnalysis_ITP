		<content>With the exception of Noke,the area is 
well served by Charlton on Otmoor      
Services,a privately owned bus company 
whose fares are very reasonable (50p   
into Oxford from Islip).The many       
people of the area who work in         
Oxford use this service regularly to   
go to and return from work.Others use  
it for shopping.Most                   
people,however,own their own cars and  
it is quite common for a family to     
have two cars.There is a huge surge of 
traffic through Islip between 8 and 9  
am going into Cowley from the Bicester 
area,and again about 5 pm              
returning.Congestion in the village's  
narrow streets is                      
considerable,and the danger has        
obliged the school to establish a      
patrol to see children across the road.
