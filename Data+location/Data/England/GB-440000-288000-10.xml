		<content> The canal is called the Ashby de la   
 Zouch canal. It flows from the North  
 to South West over a quarter of the   
 area. There are six bridges which     
 cross over the canal. Five of these   
 bridges link up the farms and their   
 land. The canal itself was not        
 overgrown but it has reeds and grasses
 on the edge. The towpath is           
 overgrown.There are nettles growing   
 over the path and it is really muddy. 
 Some of the bridges, which are        
 numbered, are old but the sides have  
 been built up to make them safer for  
 cattle crossing. In the old days they 
 had been lower so that the hubs on the
 wheels of the farm carts could  stick 
 out because the bridges were quite    
 narrow. A series of electricity pylons
 follow the line of the canal.
