		<title>05DONNINGTON WOOD VILLAGE</title>
		<content> The village is centred around the     
 intersection of Church Road, Queens   
 Road and The Fields.The area was a    
 centre for the local coal mining      
 industry.Most of the houses were built
 for the Duke of Sutherland,who owned  
 most of the land. Along The Fields are
 some long single storey houses which  
 originally housed mining families.    
    On the corner of Queens Rd. and    
 Curch Rd. is the Ravenhurst Joinery   
 Centre.This was the local Baptist     
 Church until a new church was built   
 further along Queens Rd.The village   
 still has a general store.The old     
 school on Church Rd.still exists and  
 is now an annexe of the new school.The
 Parish Church of St.Matthews is at the
 top of the hill.To the north of The   
 Fields is a modern leisure centre with
 gymnasium, swimming pool and playing  
 fields.                               </content>
