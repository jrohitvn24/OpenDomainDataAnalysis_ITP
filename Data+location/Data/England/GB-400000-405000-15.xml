		<title>15FARMING IN SADDLEWORTH</title>
		<content> The area originally had scattered     
 farmsteads with the traditional few   
 animals to keep the owners relatively 
 self-sufficient in milk, meat,etc. &amp;  
 to produce wool for spinning &amp;        
 weaving. As elsewhere in the country, 
 farming developed into more of a      
 specialised concern, and small 'dairy'
 farms came into being, amongst the    
 more traditional sheep farms. Cattle  
 were normally exclusively Shorthorns, 
 but were replaced by Freisians in more
 recent times, so 'black &amp; white' cows 
 took the place of the 'reds' &amp; 'roans'
 seen previously, as these are better  
 milk-producers. Today, however, there 
 are no longer any dairy cows to be    
 seen, nor beef cattle. Farms are now  
 solely sheep, with pasture divided    
 into pens on lower accessible slopes &amp;
 open grazing on the moors. Hay is     
 produced, but there is no arable.     </content>
