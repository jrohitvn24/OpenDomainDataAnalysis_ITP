		<content> The sewage works, built in 1898, cater
 for the needs of Prestwich.There are  
 four processes needed to clean the    
 sewage and make it ready to be pumped 
 into the River Irwell. The solid      
 effluent is taken by tankers to the   
 sewage works at Bolton where it is    
 made into methane gas. It is a small  
 plant employing five men.             
                                       
 Agecroft power station is situated in 
 the suburbs of Manchester.It has been 
 going for over a hundred years and at 
 one time was one of the biggest in    
 England.It is the main supplier of    
 electricity in Manchester,thus it is  
 deliberatly situated near a coal      
 mine,the River Irwell and also        
 relatively close to a densely         
 populated area.
