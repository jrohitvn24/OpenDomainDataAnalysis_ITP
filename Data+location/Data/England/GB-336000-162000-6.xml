		<title>06CASTLE BATCH</title>
		<content> Castle Batch is a recreational        
 area                                  
 which is surrounded on all sides by   
 new housing development.It is used by 
 local residents as a dog walking area 
 and there is a small childrens        
 playground.                           
 Castle Batch never had a castle,only a
 moat.It is large circular earthwork   
 with walls over 5 metres high,a hollow
 centre and an entrance at the         
 south-west.It was probably built as   
 the tomb to a long-forgotten          
 chieftain,possibly one of the leaders 
 of Worlebury Camp community.          
 There is some evidence to suggest that
 a gun site or fort once stood on top  
 of the mound.An old map of the Severn 
 coastline at the time when the Spanish
 Armada was expected shows a fort      
 roughly at the spot we now call Castle
 Batch.                                </content>
