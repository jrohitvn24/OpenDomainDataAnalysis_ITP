		<content>  This is still an important aspect of 
 village life, but the newcomers to the
 village are less involved and as their
 numbers grow there are fewer villages 
 to maintain religious life.           
 Traditionally the villages were       
 divided into two main groups,         
 Anglicans and Methodists. Today there 
 are three groups; Anglicans,          
 Methodists and the non_religious.  Of 
 a population of about 300 about thirty
 worship each week in the Parish       
 Church,twelve at the Methodist chapel.
 There are two or Three families which 
 are Catholic.                         
  Church members are optimistic and    
 have this year reroofed the 13th      
 century church at a cost of Â£18,000.  
  The methodists are also planning to  
 refloor their chapel.
