		<content>     The parish council is to press for
 more{parking spaces,}despite a refusal
 from Bracknell District Council due to
 lack of available funds.              
                                       
     A petition has been sent to       
 Berkshire County Council deploring the
{postponement}of the provision of a    
{Nursery Unit}at Broadmoor School.     
                                       
  The future of the{charity shop,}which
 is the sole source of income for the  
 village's short stay home and day     
 centre for the elderly, is secure for 
 the next two years as the council have
 renewed the lease on the premises.    
                                       
  The information on this disk has been
 collected by the children of{Broadmoor
{Primary}and{Edgbarrow Comprehensive   
{Schools.}They would like to thank the 
 people of Crowthorne for their help.  </content>
