		<content>   Casey's Camping started their       
 business in 1983 and sell a range of  
 camping equipment. The building which 
 they work in was built in 1877. There 
 are five floors and only the one in   
 use.                                  
   Around the mill there are several   
 other industrial buildings which      
 include an engineering company, a foam
 company, and a furniture and carpet   
 warehouse. Next to Casey's Camping    
 there used to be a 190 ft. chimney    
 which has been knocked down. At the   
 back of the mill there used to be a   
 lodge which is now a car park for the 
 industrial estate.
