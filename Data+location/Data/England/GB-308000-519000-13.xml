		<title>13FELL FOX HUNTING  LAMPLUGH</title>
		<content> The fell fox hunting season starts    
 in September and finishes in May. In  
 fell fox hunting you go on foot       
 instead of horse back because you     
 could not go far on horse back. The   
 huntsman meets the farmers and makes a
 list of places to hunt. Then he starts
 to do early morning hunts, for these  
 he has to get up at 4.30 am. The      
 huntsman has 45 hounds he takes about 
 30 to 32 hounds out on a hunt. If a   
 hound has a cold the huntsman does not
 take it out for another two weeks     
 after its cured. The hounds get fed on
 porrage and flaked maize. The huntsman
 mixes the feed in big pots and cooks  
 it in them too. They power the pots by
 gas. The reason for fell fox hunting  
 is to keep the numbers of foxs down   
 all year and especially in lambing    
 season.
