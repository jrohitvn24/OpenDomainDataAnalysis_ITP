In 1984 the new extensions to Boxford  
School were completed.  There only used
to be two classrooms so some classes   
were in mobile classrooms on the       
playing field.  We now have classrooms 
with adjoining activity areas.  The    
extension had to be built so that it   
was in-keeping with the oldest part of 
the building which dates back to 1839. 
The school was remodelled because      
nearby Assington school was closed in  
1984 and the children now come by bus  
to Boxford.  Children also come by bus 
from Edwardstone and Groton.           
                                       
Mr. Lowe has been the head teacher for 
eighteen years.                        
                                       
We have playing fields and we have a   
covered swimming pool which children   
from other schools can also use.       </content>
