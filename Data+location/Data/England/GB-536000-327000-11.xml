		<title>11Pea selling,Holbeach Hurn.</title>
		<content> Every year the village of Holbeach    
 Hurn has a "pea sale".On each of two  
 Saturday mornings in July the         
 villagers turn out onto the playing   
 field at about 8.30a.m.Waiting there  
 will be a massive trailer load of     
 freshly vined peas.These are then sold
 by the scoopful,each about 2lbs.The   
 sale goes on until 1p.m.People come   
 from all over the country to buy,and  
 some people buy as many as 20 or more 
 scoops.They bring all sorts of things 
 to put the peas in,from carrier bags  
 to plastic dustbins.In July 1985 a    
 scoop cost 50p.There was also one     
 Saturday morning selling peas on      
 Spalding market.The peas come from    
 local farmers who sell them to the    
 village at discount price.They are    
 washed and shelled for sale.The       
 profits go towards buying things for  
 the villagers and their hall.         </content>
