		<title>13ATTRACTIONS OF HAMSTERLEY</title>
		<content>  On the way to the Church,which stands
 1/2 mile east of the village can be   
 seen an excellent example of the      
 medieval open field system with its   
 long narrow strips-STETHS-separated   
 from each other by BALKS-portions of  
 the wall which can also be seen.On the
 north side of Bedburn is The Castles,a
 fortified enclosure of stone walls at 
 the foot of a ridge of hills.It has   
 puzzled antiquarians but is believed  
 to have been a camp of protection     
 built on Roman plan.The ruins of      
 Bedburn Mill remind us of the industry
 once in the area.A rectangular site of
 a moated homestead may be seen at East
 Shipley.Near Park House is a sulphur  
 spring,samples having lately been     
 taken for analyses for radio active   
 properties.Hoppyland Hall,now in ruins
 was once the seat of the local squire 
 The stone is now used to repair walls.</content>
