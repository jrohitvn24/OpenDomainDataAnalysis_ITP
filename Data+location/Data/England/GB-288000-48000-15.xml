		<title>15Dartmouth Castle (cont.)</title>
		<content> Down in the basement it was wet and   
 rocky,there was a freshwater spring   
 and they used to store the gunpowder  
 there.On the groundfloor there were   
 swords,pikes,helmets and breastplates.
 There was a first floor which had a   
 kitchen with a big fireplace,2        
 bedrooms,a toilet place and a living  
 room.On the battlements,we hid in a   
 little watch-house.I could see a      
 long way across the sea and the River 
 Dart.Once there was a chain           
 going across the river to Kingswear   
 which they could pull up to keep enemy
 ships out.There is a display of       
 different sorts of cannon near the    
 gate of the castle.Next-door there is 
 a little church called St.Petrox.There
 is a shop in the tower which was a    
 Victorian lighthouse.We climbed up the
 corner tower of the old keep, in the  
 mist we could hear boats,gulls,waves. </content>
