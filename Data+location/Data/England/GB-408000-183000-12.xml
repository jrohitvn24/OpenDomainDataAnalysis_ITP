		<title>12West Swindon Shopping Centre</title>
		<content> To serve the west Swindon community a 
 the West Swindon Centre has been built
 including the Carrefour Hypermarket,  
 24 smaller shops and a pub called "The
 Harvester".                           
 The{restaurant}has over{6000 customers
{every week,}with Thurs_Sat being the  
 busiest time of week with 1500        
 customers each day. Modern equipment  
 like a{Â£15000 dishwasher}makes life   
 easier for the staff as do microwaves 
 and convector ovens.                  
 In a survey of shops most said that   
 the{Fri-Sat period}was the{busiest    
 time with people shopping for the     
 weekend.                              
 Outside there is extensive car parking
 a play area for children and an       
 attempt has been made to landscape the
 area but the choice of building       
 material, concrete block, is rather   
 drab.                                 </content>
