		<title>10HEAD VERGER,DURHAM CATHEDRAL</title>
		<content> Mr.Owen Rees' job is one of the       
 busiest in the Cathedral.He is the {  
{Public Relations Officer}caring for   
 the welfare of the visitors.The       
 Vergers care for school parties,      
 services,concerts and the daily       
 routine of the Cathedral.This job can 
 be very hectic and with about{500,000}
 visitors per annum,these are mainly in
 the summer months,it can be very      
 tiring and you can become overworked  
 so his days off when he takes his     
 Spaniels for a walk or goes to Berwick
 on Tweed and his four weeks holiday   
 are a just reward.                    
  There are times when the Cathedral   
 becomes overcrowded.Once British Rail 
 offered cheap tickets to pensioners   
 and this brought the crowds in.{Bishop
{David Jenkins}has also brought a lot  
 of publicity to the diocese.This means
 that Mr.Rees often has to say "stop". </content>
