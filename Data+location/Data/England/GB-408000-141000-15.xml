		<title>15SALISBURY PLAIN "BARROWS"</title>
		<content> There  are many types of "Barrow" -   
 burial mounds - in this area.         
{King and Queen barrows}were used for  
 the burial of royalty or V.I.P's.{    
{Long barrows}were used to bury many   
 people and measured 100 ft. long. {   
{Round barrows}were of three types:    
{ Bowl:}a small inverted shape for one 
        person.                        
{ Bell:}a shallow hand-bell shape used 
        to bury warriors.              
{ Disc:}a tiny hump surrounded by a    
        circular bank and used to bury 
        women.                         
 Radioactive materials have dated these
 barrows between 4000 BC and 2000 BC.  
 They were made of stone or wooden     
 structures and covered with rubbly    
 chalk.                                
 Today these barrows are covered over  
 by grass and wild flowers and         
 sometimes fenced for protection.      </content>
