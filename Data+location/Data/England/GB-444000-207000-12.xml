		<title>12The White Hart, Wytham.</title>
		<content> The 15th century village pub is called
 "The White Hart". It stands at the    
 centre of the village, close to the   
 church and the village shop, its old  
 stone walls and tiled roof, with      
 several gables, adding to the         
 picturesque appearance of the village.
 In the courtyard behind the pub is an 
 old dovecot now used for a wood store.
 "The White Hart" is owned by Halls    
 Brewery and is one of the well-known  
 pubs in the area. Three miles from the
 centre of Oxford it is a very popular 
 student pub, a favourite lunching     
 place for local businessmen and       
 academics, the haunt of tourists in   
 the summer and the accepted meeting   
 place for the 'regulars'. The walled  
 garden with its wrought iron gates,   
 the converted barn, the stone-flagged 
 floor and the huge open fireplace in  
 the bar add charm to this village pub.</content>
