		<content> Lionel Walter Rothschild was born in  
 1868 and soon became very interested  
 in natural history.At the age of seven
 his intention was to create a museum. 
 He had help from a skilled taxidermist
 named Alfred Minall.By the time of    
 Lionel's 21st birthday he had such a  
 huge collection that his father was   
 persuaded to build  two cottages, one 
 for Minall and one for a library and  
 display gallery.                      
 The museum grew in the years and      
 because of this two more people were  
 to help run it called Ernst Hartert   
 and Karl Jorden.                      
 Today Tring Museum which is in Akeman 
 Street has 120,000 visitors each year 
 and some of the animals which Lionel  
 first collected can still be seen     
 today.People come from all over the   
 world to see the animals.
