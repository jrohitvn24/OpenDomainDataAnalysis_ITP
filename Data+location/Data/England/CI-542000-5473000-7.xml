		<content> Brecqhou is an island off the west    
 coast of Sark.It is privately owned   
 and therefore inaccessible to the     
 General Public.                       
 The island which has a total area of  
 160 acres is surrounded by cliffs     
 making any sea landing difficult.There
 is one sheltered landing on the south-
 west of the island and another to the 
 north-east known as "Jacob's Ladder". 
 Brecqhou has 70 acres of land         
 available for farming and there is a  
 working farm on the island.The owner's
 house and servants' cottages have been
 fully renovated.Generally,access is by
 helicopter and there is a landing pad 
 on the island.                        
 Brecqhou is separated from Sark by a  
 narrow stretch of water called the    
 "Gouliot Passage" and the telephone   
 link between the two islands can be   
 seen straddling the gap.              </content>
