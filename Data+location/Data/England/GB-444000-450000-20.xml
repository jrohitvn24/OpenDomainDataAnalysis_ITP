		<title>20Tockwith Charity Cycle Race.</title>
		<content>   The first cycle race was organized  
 in June 1982, by a Tockwith youth     
 leader, Mr Alan Kay. It was to raise  
 money, by sponsorship, for Tockwith   
 Youth Club. The race was from Tockwith
 to Scarborough, 62 miles away. It was 
 so popular that it has become an      
 annual event. In 1985, the race       
 started in Wetherby. 392 cyclists took
 part. Their ages ranged from 12 to 80 
 years. The fastest person took 4      
 hours, and the slowest 10 hours.      
 People from all over the area took    
 part and people from as far afield as 
 London and Devon. The race was        
 advertised locally and in cycling     
 magazines. Approximately Â£10 500 was  
 raised and the money was shared       
 between Martin House Children's       
 Hospice for the terminally ill, and a 
 National Cancer Relief Fund.
