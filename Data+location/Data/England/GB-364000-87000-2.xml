		<title>02Farming Around Martinstown.</title>
		<content>   The agricultural land of the area   
 lies in the South Winterborne valley  
 and on the surrounding chalk slopes.  
   There are six main farms:Park,Ashton
 ,Winterborne Monkton,Wylye Croft and  
 Clandon.Although just outside the     
 grid, some of Manor Farm's fields     
 occupy the Northernmost section.      
   Most farming is dairy. The land     
 cover survey  shows a high percentage 
 of rough or managed grassland.Many    
 fields were also laid down with kale  
 or similar fodder crops.              
   There is little woodland here,      
 although Ashton Farm has planted some 
 acres along the Monkton road with     
 coniferous seedlings since 1983.One   
 difficulty for farmers is the large   
 numbers of tumuli that litter this    
 landscape.Conservation and economics  
 battle over the question:To plough,   
 graze or preserve?                    </content>
