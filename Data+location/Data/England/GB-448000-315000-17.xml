		<content>  Longcliffe Ecology Centre is just    
 past Nanpantan and close to the Golf  
 Course. It covers 20 acres of land and
 is listed as an area of outstanding   
 scientific and scenic interest.       
    It is a place where students can   
 study wildlife and various ecosystems.
 There are six types of land surface:- 
 1. naturally regenerating Charnwood   
    Forest                             
 2. grazed woodland                    
 3. cleared pasture.                   
 4. coppice                            
 5. cultivated land                    
 6. pond area                          
    The present owner bought the land  
 in l978.  Before that, the area had   
 been neglected.  About a hundred years
 ago,part of the area formed a carriage
 way and rhododendrons were planted    
 along the drive. Now they cover a     
 rocky area known as Rhododendron Hill.</content>
