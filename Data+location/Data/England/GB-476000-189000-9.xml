		<content>  In each of the villages there are    
public houses, all serving food. The   
King's Arms in Skirmett is an Inn with 
four bedrooms. Only The Crown in       
Skirmett and The Prince Albert at      
Frieth approximate to being locals.    
The Yew Tree at Frieth is a licenced   
restaurant, The King's Arms, The Bull  
and Butcher in Turville, and The       
Chequers at Fingest all serve main     
meals and attract a clientelle from a  
wide area. The Bull and Butcher is a   
favourite of the car rally fraternity, 
and currently the King's Arms is a     
venue for the younger set in that it   
provides live music -individual music- 
ians, groups etc., each week.          
  The Yew Tree some fifteen years ago  
was a typical old English village      
local, then modernised and lately      
converted to a licenced restaurant.
