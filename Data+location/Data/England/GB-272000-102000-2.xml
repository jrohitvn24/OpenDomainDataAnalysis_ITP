		<title>02DOWN-ST-MARY VILLAGE HALL</title>
		<content>  The Village Hall is on the edge of   
 the green next to the church. It was  
 built in 1860 and used to be a school 
 containing about 40 pupils. The last  
 headmistress was Miss Ball and the    
 last infant teacher was Miss Kathy    
 Andrews. Miss Ball came from          
 Ilfracombe. She came by train to      
 teach. When the school closed down in 
 1939 there were only three infants:   
 Michael Quant, Pat Gun, and Phyliss   
 Shobbrook; and the juniors were Johnny
 Harris, John Bolt, Philip Quant, Ian  
 Quant, Alan Lear, Billy Tonkins and   
 Madeline Tout. The infants went to Bow
 School and the juniors to North       
 Tawton. It is now just a Village Hall 
 used for many activities, including   
 the Youth Club and Women's Institute.
