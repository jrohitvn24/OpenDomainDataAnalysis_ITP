		<content>   The wife of a local farmer came to  
tell us about her farm. It is one of   
the smallest farms in the area; they   
own 46 acres and rent a further 49     
acres. It is a dairy farm and they     
own  70 cows (and 7 horses wich they   
ride for pleasure). The milk is sold   
to the milk marketing board. On their  
land they grow grass and they turn     
some of it into silage and some into   
hay. It is hard work, especially in    
winter and if it is snowing they       
somtimes connot get across their       
fields. Somtimes vandals come on to    
the farm and destroy farm land and     
mess about with the hay. Despite this  
all the family enjoy living on a farm. 
   This farm does not use any sprays or
chemicals, but of course some sprays   
are blown over from other farms onto   
other peoples land.
