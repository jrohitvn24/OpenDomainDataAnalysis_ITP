		<content> Attitudes vary with age. People of    
 middle age and over have usually lived
 in the area all their lives and have  
 relatives and friends here. They do   
 not go out much and regret the lack of
 old village life - doctor, butcher,   
 baker. They feel life is not as good  
 as it was. New people have usually    
 chosen to live here and purchased     
 their own houses. They tend to be     
 young, most have children and have    
 created facilities for them -         
 playgroups and Youth Clubs.  Children 
 are children anywhere and happily     
 attend the village school. They are   
 more unsophisticated than the children
 from the cities and towns.
