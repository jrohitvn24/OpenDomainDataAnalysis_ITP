		<title>10Choir fete</title>
		<content> On 20th July the{Church Choir}held a  
{fete}followed by a barbecue to raise  
 money for some new{choir robes.}Not   
 many people stayed at the fete because
 it rained so much, but there were     
 cake, jewellery, book, art and craft, 
 plant and produce stalls, a tombola,  
 raffle and a big bouncy castle. The   
 cake stall raised about Â£40. The      
{barbecue}was very successful because  
 it didn't rain; there was also a disco
 there.{Guidford Cathedral Choir}sung  
 evensong before the barbecue, they    
 were there as well. The fete was held 
 in the churchyard and in the rectory  
 garden; the barbecue was held at the  
 school.In the middle of the fete there
 was a wedding as well.
