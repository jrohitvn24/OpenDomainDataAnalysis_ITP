		<content>   Teynham Church of England Primary   
 School lies just north of the A2. The 
 present building replaced the original
 19th Century structure about 11 years 
 ago. It is a single-storey building of
 light construction, standing in what  
 was formerly a cherry orchard. The    
 school has a large playing field, part
 of which will shortly be sold for the 
 building of a Parish hall.            
   At present there are approximately  
 290 children attending the school,    
 aged between 5 and 11. The majority   
 live close to the school on housing   
 estates built in the 1960s. Most of   
 these houses are semi-detached. A     
 number of pupils live in Conyer, about
 two miles away. The staff comprises   
 ten teachers and a headmistress.      
   An unusual feature of the school is 
 its use as a church on Sundays.
