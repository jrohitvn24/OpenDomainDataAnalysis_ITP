		<title>14William Penn in Chorleywood</title>
		<content>William Penn was born in London in 1644
and became famous for his Quaker       
beliefs and the founding of the state  
of Pennsylvania. However he had many   
connections with the local area and in 
Chorleywood two local buildings are of 
particular note.                       
THE MANOR HOUSE opposite Christ Church 
on the A404 was originally known as    
Meeting House Farm and was a meeting   
house for local Quakers including Penn.
Behind the house is a small burial     
ground.                                
PENN FARM is a Tudor Building on the   
corner of Shepherds Lane and Berry     
Lane. Known to be a Protestant meeting 
place during the English Civil War it  
is the house where William Penn was    
married to Guilelma Springett.
