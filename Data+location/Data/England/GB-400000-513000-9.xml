		<content>  Kilmond Wood Quarry is the only      
 quarry in the block area that is still
 in operation.At present it is owned by
 Hargreaves,a local haulage and highway
 maintenance firm.There is only one    
 permanent employee who is generally   
 occupied in supervising the premises  
 and controlling the public weighbridge
 situated near the entrance.When large 
 amounts of ballast are needed the firm
 contracts out to another firm called  
 Budge.Local people do visit the quarry
 to order various amounts of gravel or 
 loose chippings.                      
  During the construction of the A66   
 dual carriageway the quarry was very  
 busy with blasting,rock sorting and   
 crushing.Considerably more local men  
 were employed then.Unfortunately,the  
 completion of the roadworks signalled 
 an immediate fall in production and a 
 reduction in the number of employees. </content>
