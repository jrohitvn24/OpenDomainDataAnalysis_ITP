 works night shift and goes on courses.
 His position is a T1 which is a       
 formans job.He has Saturday and Sunday
 off also every other Friday.Sometimes 
 he works up a pole or in the exchange 
 and outside.He wears overalls over his
 clothes and when he's up a pole he    
 wears helmets and safety belts. He has
 to pay his bills the same as everyone
