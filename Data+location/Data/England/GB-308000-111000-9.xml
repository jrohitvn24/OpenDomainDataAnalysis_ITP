		<title>09Culmstock after World War 1</title>
		<content> Many of the old cottages in Culmstock 
 have been pulled down.Three cottages  
 which were where the garage is now had
 a trap door outside with steps leading
 down to the well where they used to   
 get their water.The old train,which   
 stopped carrying passengers in l963   
 provided many days out especially to  
 Exeter for shopping.One of the best   
 days of the year would be Culmstock   
 Fair when the windows of all the      
 houses would be boarded up by eight   
 o'clock in the morning so that the    
 cattle could be turned loose onto the 
 streets controlled,it was hoped,by    
 their owners.The sheep would be penned
 behind the vicarage and the auction   
 would begin.At lunch time the dealers 
 would be given free bread,cheese and  
 cider.The local boys were welcome to a
 share of the bread and cheese but     
 there was very little spare cider!    </content>
