		<title>05FARMING IN SHERIFFHALES</title>
		<content> Slaters farm in Sheriffhales is a     
 dairy farm but there are a few beef   
 cattle.The land covers 600 acres and  
 is used for growing wheat, barley,    
 sugarbeet and rye grass.The Rye grass 
 is regrown every 5 years, because of  
 grass and other crops getting mixed in
 with it.The grass is cut twice a year 
 with a 6 week gap inbetween. The brown
 and white cattle that are kept at the 
 farm are Ayrshires and there are 140  
 of them. The milk gets sucked out of  
 the cows through some pipes and       
 into a big metal tank which keeps the 
 milk cold. Each cow gives 3 gallons a 
 day and 1200 gallons of milk in a     
 year. The place where the silage is   
 stored is quite a long way from where 
 the milking takes place. It is stored 
 in an area with concrete walls cutting
 it off from the rest of the farm.
