		<title>06Transport in Knypersley.</title>
		<content>  As Knypersley is relatively small its
transport facilitiesare limited.The    
only public transport system is a bus  
route via Knypersley to Hanley and     
Newcastle-under-Lyme.                  
  The residential estate surrounding   
the High School has a regular two      
hourly bus service on a local circular 
route.A single bus service by the small
local Stoniers Company runs from this  
estate to Hanley.It is inconvenient due
its infrequency.The alternative service
requires users to travel into          
Knypersley before they may join the    
service to reach Hanley.               
  The Council owned estate has a       
regular half-hourly service to Biddulph
and Hanley.This service links with     
others to Congleton.                   
  Charges are generally regarded as    
reasonable with concessions to the     
eldery and children at two/thirds fare.</content>
