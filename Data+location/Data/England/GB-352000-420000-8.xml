		<content> Surrounding Leyland is a large area of
 agricultural land and many farms.Farm 
 machinery is often seen on the roads. 
 Some of the farms around Leyland are  
 Brookfold Farm,Cliffs Farm,Rose Hill  
 Farm,Altcar Farm and Snubsnape Farm.  
 Some of the farmhouses and farm       
 buildings have been converted into    
 homes.                                
 We visited{Snubsnape Farm}and asked   
 the farmer some questions.The         
 farmhouse is on Altcar Lane and was   
 built in 1696.The farmer is called{Mr.
{Tattersall}and his family has farmed  
 there for 3 generations.He has three  
 people working for him.He has 50 acres
 of land on which he grows barley and  
 grass for hay and silage. He also     
 keeps cows,sheep,pigs,geese and some  
 horses.                               
 He would like money to grow wheat and 
 for more machinery.                   </content>
