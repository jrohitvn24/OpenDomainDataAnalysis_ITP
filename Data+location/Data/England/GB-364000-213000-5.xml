		<content> Thoughout the years a language has    
 developed in the forest, we still use 
 some of it now. Here is a conversation
 in 'Forest'.                          
                                       
{"How bist yer old butt?" said Bert.   
{"I bent very well I hit me yud on a   
{stwun," said Alf.                     
{"Yer bist a right muntle, how duw do  
{it?" said Bert.                       
{"I was chasing me ship, me vit slipped
{into a dipple. It did'nt half give me 
{some jip. I was wum for a wik with a  
{bad yud "                             
                                       
 This tells of a man who banged his    
 head on a stone while he was chasing  
 his sheep. His feet slipped into a    
 steep sided pit. It gave him so much  
 pain he stayed home for a week.       
                                       
                                       </content>
