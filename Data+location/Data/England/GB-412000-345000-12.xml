		<content>THE MOTHER OF SCHOOL CHILDREN          
I usually wake up between 7a.m. and    
7.30m. After dressing,I wake up my     
daughter and sons and go downstairs    
to prepare breakfast.What a variety... 
From toast to cereals,to marmite       
sandwiches,something different for     
everyone.At 8 a.m. the eldest,Jason,   
leaves home to catch the bus to school.
Then at 8.07a.m. the second,Robert,    
leaves to catch his bus.After these two
departures,Nicholas,my third son helps 
to wash the breakfast pots.After we've 
 inished it is time to make sure that  
Nick,Richard and Elizabeth are ready to
make the journey to school,although    
Elizabeth isn't old enough yet.She     
likes making sure where her brothers   
are.This morning,Thursday,Elizabeth and
I went to Ashbourne,as it was Market   
Day, and did some shopping.
