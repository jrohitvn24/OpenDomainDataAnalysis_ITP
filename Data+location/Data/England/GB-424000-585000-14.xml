		<content>  One day Carly's French grandpa came  
 to our class to talk about the changes
 in Ashington since he came in 1947    
 after the war.                        
   He said there were many things which
 have changed.Across the road from     
 Bothal School there used to be long   
 rows of houses,but they have been     
 demolished and I live in the modern   
 ones now.                             
  Where Hintons is there was once a    
 railway station.You can just see the  
 remains of the platforms now.         
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
