		<title>16GILMORTON POST OFFICE</title>
		<content> Gilmorton Post Office Stores was built
 in 1880 by Mr Clayton Willey as a     
 hotel,but it never opened as one.It   
 then became a shop and family home.The
 present owner and his family came to  
 the village from London in 1973 and   
 has continued as a general store and  
 post office.In the shop they try to   
 carry as many goods as                
 possible,including food,coal,calor    
 gas,stationery and some hardware      
 goods.The post office caters for the  
 collection of mail,distribution of    
 family allowances and old age         
 pensions.The shop provides a useful   
 service in communication for the      
 village as all manner of notices are  
 displayed in the shop window.
