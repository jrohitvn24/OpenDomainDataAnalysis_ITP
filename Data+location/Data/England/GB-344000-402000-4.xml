		<title>04Residents Concerns</title>
		<content>The people in the area have many       
feelings towards the area both from a  
negative and positive point of view.   
          Although there is a public   
transport system consisting of both    
a  rail and bus network, a large       
percentage of residents feel that the  
bus services are totally inadequate    
and that if given the option this is   
the one most important facility they   
would ask for.                         
  There is a great deal of concern     
that there are not enough facilities   
for children and teenagers.Within      
walking distance of Rainford           
Junction there is only one small       
play area. At a meeting  on the        
12th June 1984 the Community Liason    
Forum stated that "local parents had   
been motivated towards more provision  
socially for young people and that 80  
young people wish to join a Youth Club"</content>
