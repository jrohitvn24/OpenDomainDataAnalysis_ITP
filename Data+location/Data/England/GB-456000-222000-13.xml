		<title>13LOCAL ISSUES IN BICESTER</title>
		<content>Over the past year there has been      
concern about the integration of       
American personnel in the town.300 more
houses are due to be built at          
Caversfield.Local residents are worried
that house prices will depreciate.They 
are not allowed to use American        
facilities.                            
THE M40:The plans for the M40 have     
finally been passed, much to the       
 elief of people living in Bicester.It 
 is hoped this will take some of the   
heavy traffic out of the town centre   
and bring more jobs to the area.       
OPEN SPACES:The local paper,the        
'Bicester Advertiser',has featured     
many letters about the lack of open    
spaces in the town.Plans have been     
mooted to build on large playing       
fields behind Bicester School and      
Longfields.People are angry that they  
will have nowhere to their dogs.       </content>
