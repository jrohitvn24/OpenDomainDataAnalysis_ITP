		<title>14N.TONBRIDGE FASHION:MODERN</title>
		<content>  In our interview with 2 people in    
 their twenties we learnt that women's 
 fashions are reverting to the 60's    
 look eg mini_skirts.The prices have   
 risen.Hairstyles now are wilder and   
 formerly people wore duller coloured, 
 more straightforward clothes.Studs and
 chains are less fashionable than a few
 years ago.Hats have not been popular  
 for many years.Men's suits in the 70's
 were similar to those of the 60's but 
 were of plainer line with no flared   
 trousers.Double_breasted jackets are  
 returning and shirts and jerseys more 
 popular.Casual clothes are now gener_ 
 ally smarter.Trousers now are baggier 
 and wider whereas in the mid_70's     
 clothes were tight.Hair is worn much  
 shorter now than in the 70's."Punk"   
 spikey hairstyles are very recent.    
 Jeans were very popular in the 70's   
 and still are.                        </content>
