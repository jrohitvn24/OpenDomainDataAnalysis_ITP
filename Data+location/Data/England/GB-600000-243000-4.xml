		<title>04AIRFIELD</title>
		<content>  The airfield was originally built in 
World War 2 as an American Air base.   
Today it is used by light aeroplanes   
and a Glider Club,it is open to the    
public at weekends.                    
  On the airfield is a windsock wich is
used by the pilots to tell them the    
direction the wind is blowing.There are
also hangers used to store aircraft and
gliders when they are not being used.  
  People enjoy flying gliders here     
because it is peaceful and all they can
hear is the rushing wind.When they look
down they can see the fields full off  
crops and poeple or animals looking    
like tiny ants.
