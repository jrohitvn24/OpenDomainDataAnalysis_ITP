		<title>03COUNTRY LIFE - THE LAND</title>
		<content> The twelve grid sqares allocated for  
 this project are almost totally used  
 for farming.The land is generally flat
 or undulating with small areas of     
 woodland and copse between the fields 
 of crops.The woodlands contain a      
 mixture of trees but are mainly       
 deciduous with a variety of plants and
 wildlife.The woods are private and may
 contain wild fowl.                    
 The farms are large and concentrate on
 arable farming.The fields are varied  
 in size but mostly large.The main     
 crops grown are wheat and barley. This
 gives the landscape a beautiful view  
 of rolling green fields in the Spring 
 with the skyline broken up by the     
 woodlands.                            
 There are few roads in this area most 
 of which are narrow country lanes     
 running through the farmlands.
