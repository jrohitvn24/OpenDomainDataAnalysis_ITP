		<content>The children at our school have a      
variety of hobbies and so do the       
parents. These range from sport,       
gardening, reading, DIY, home brewing  
to sleeping as was stated by one       
person. A lot of people use a near by  
park in their time. There are some     
facilities at Cofton park for all the  
family. A lot of people go there just  
to walk, they may also take their      
dogs. Both exercising and training of  
dogs takes place as well as a lot of   
fun for the dogs. There are facilities 
for football cricket and other ball    
games for the enegetic members of the  
family. For the children there is a    
play area with swings and a slide and  
an assault course. The more adventurous
may be seen body popping. Some children
use this area to learn to ride their   
bike in saftey. Others may be learning 
to fly kites in the open areas.        </content>
