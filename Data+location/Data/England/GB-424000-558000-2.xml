		<content> Several of the settlements are very   
 old. They formed individual           
 villages. During the 19th century     
 areas of industrial housing were built
 and in the 20th century much of the   
 remaining land was built on to form   
 estates - housing areas with some     
 amenities.In many cases these new     
 housing areas were built to replace   
 houses in the town centre which were  
 too old,the old houses have been      
 knocked down.  All of these areas were
  given names which appear on the O.S. 
 Map. Examples of the old villages are 
 Eighton Banks and Lamesley. An example
 of a 19th Century industrial          
 settlement is Wrekenton. Examples of  
 20th Century Council and Private      
 estates (some estates have both       
 council and private houses) are       
 Blackhill,White Hills and Chowdene.
