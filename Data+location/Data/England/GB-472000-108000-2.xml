		<title>02Sharp's Copse(Description)</title>
		<content>   Sharp's Copse is situated at the    
{western side}of Leigh-Park. It was    
 built by{Portsmouth City Council.}When
 it was built it had problems with     
 vandalism and theft. Now there are    
 less problems,which could reflect the 
 fact that the estate has matured.     
 There is an awful lot of unemployment 
 and only{12%}of the children who have 
 school dinners pay for them.          
   There are large areas of green land 
 for children to play on but there is a
 lack of places for social activities  
 except for{St Alban's}church hall and 
{Wakeford's School.                    
   More houses are privately owned and 
 this adds to the appearance of the    
 area.                                 
   Many of the working people          
 particularly women work on the New    
 Lane industrial estate.
