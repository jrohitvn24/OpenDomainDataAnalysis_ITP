		<title>10WEATHER AND ECOLOGY.</title>
		<content> The area is considered locally to have
 a unique climate as showers often pass
 by. It is very windy with prevailing  
 West or South West winds.  Very       
 occasionally the winds are so         
 salt_laden, leaves of trees are       
 scorched. Although atmospheric        
 pollution from Severn_side industry is
 visible it is strictly controlled and 
 so its effect on the environ is not   
 very apparent.                        
 The Elm trees are recovering after the
 devastation of Dutch Elm disease.     
 Cowslips flourish on motorway edges.  
 Butterflies are increasing, as are    
 bats. Rabbits have increased greatly  
 this year causing havoc in many       
 gardens.
