		<title>03ILFRACOMBE HARBOUR</title>
		<content> Today in the harbour there are only   
 small privately owned fishing and     
 sailing boats.Some fishing boats take 
 parties of people fishing.One         
 boat,the Queen of Cornwall,takes      
 visitors for voyages along the coast  
 in summer.Surrounding the harbour are 
 many small shops.One is a boat        
 chandlers and the others are mainly   
 gift shops used by tourists rather    
 than local people.You will also find  
 cafes,restaurants and take away food  
 shops,but they are only open in the   
 summer season.There is a pier where   
 the life boat is stationed.Both adults
 and children enjoy fishing from the   
 pier.It is very crowded in the summer 
 the car parks are always full and even
 the pier is used for parking cars.Once
 a year a paddle steamer,the Waverley, 
 arrives and takes passengers to Lundy.
