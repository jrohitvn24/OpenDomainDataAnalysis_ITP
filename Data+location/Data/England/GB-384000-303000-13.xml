		<content>The Grecian Temple, Chillington Woods,a
fine address,a deserted lodge a half   
mile or so within the woods of a park  
set out by Capability Brown in the late
eighteenth century. On a cloudy night  
it was surrounded by blackness, its out
line barely visible. The silence almost
deafening,interrupted only by the eerie
calls from the woods and nearby lake.In
the daytime a more idyllic place could 
not be imagined. The drive from the    
gates transported one back to past eras
being lined with mature, mixed woodland
redolent of the atmosphere and times of
Charles II and the Royal Oak, not three
miles away across the fields. Nearing  
the Temple, Chillington Pool comes into
view-silent,inviting yet daunting. In  
front of the Temple, 'Capability' had  
placed a grassy avenue leading to the  
pool, and at the rear, the cottage     
attached was surrounded by tall trees. </content>
