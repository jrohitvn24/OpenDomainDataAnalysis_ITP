		<title>14HIGH TOP OBSERVATORY.</title>
		<content> In January 1986{Halley's Comet}will be
 sighted again.The comet was seen last 
 in 1910 and the next time it will be  
 observed (apart from 1986) will be    
 2062.When it appears in 1986 a        
 satelite interceptor called{Giotto}   
 willenable us to learn about the      
 comets composition and to detect it's 
 nucleus--if it exists,it may also     
 reveal some of the mysteries          
 surrounding the origins of our solar  
 system.The satelite is named after the
 florentine artist Giotto Di Bondone   
 who (it is estimated) was born in 1267
 and died 1337.Giotto painted a fresco 
 called "The Adoration of the          
 Magi",painted in the background of    
 this picture was Halley's Comet.The   
 Giotto satelite will be one in five   
 satelites sent to meet Halley's       
 Comet.In 1986 High Top observatory    
 will observe Halley's Comet.          </content>
