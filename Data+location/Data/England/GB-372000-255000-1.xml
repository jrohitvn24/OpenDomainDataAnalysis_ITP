 The area that the children of         
 Whitbourne School have studied is a   
{rural area}incorporating the two      
 villages of{Broadwas}and              
{Whitbourne.}The land is undulating and
 used mainly for crops including many  
{orchards.}There is also much{natural  
{woodland}and it is considered to be a 
 area of{scenic beauty.} We have chosen
 to concentrate on our own village and 
 our text relates to life as it is     
 lived today.The accounts are those of 
 the children living in a pretty and   
 thriving village.The{population       
 consists of a cross_section of people 
 involved in{local farming}and in      
{commuting}to larger towns in the area.
 Buildings can be found dating from the
 middle ages to the present time and   
 the village has a thriving church and 
 school.                               </content>
