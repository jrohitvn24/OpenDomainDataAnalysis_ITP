		<content> "I came to Borehamwood fom London in  
 1953. Theobald Street was a country   
 road which seemed to go on for ever.  
 There were big houses on both sides,  
 which have now been replaced by modern
 buildings. Ours was one of the first  
 roads on the Council estate to be     
 occupied. There were no pavements or  
 road-surfacing, just a muddy track.   
 Halfway down scaffolding had been     
 erected to prevent cars passing       
 through to the rest of the estate     
 which was still under construction.   
 There were a few shops next to the    
 Wellington pub, including a bakers and
 a butchers, with cattle grazing in the
 field next to it. In the main road was
 a small Sainsbury's and Boots the     
 chemist. There were also rows of      
 cottages along each side of the shops:
 in one of these the local doctor held 
 his surgery."                         </content>
