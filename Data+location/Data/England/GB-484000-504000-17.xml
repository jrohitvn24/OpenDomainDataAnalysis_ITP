 The entire block, except for about    
 2.5 hectares north of Eskdaleside     
 road is within the National Park. The 
{objectives of a National Park}are "to 
 preserve and enhance the natural      
 beauty" of the area, "to promote its  
 enjoyment by the public", but at the  
 same time "to pay due regard" to local
 needs.                                
                                       
{Schemes for}the{ management} of the   
 uplands,and for the planting of native
 deciduous trees, are there to help the
 land owners to "conserve the essential
 character" of the area and can assist 
 in resolving  conflicts of land use.  
                                       
 The provision of the{Bluebank Top Car 
{Park}and the "beehive" litter bins may
 have reduced picnicking and perhaps   
 sheep kills, elsewhere on the A169.   </content>
