		<title>04A DAY IN MY LIFE by P.Quinn</title>
		<content> On school mornings I wake up at       
 7.30am go downstairs and make my      
 breakfast and eat a cereal called     
 Cornflakes.I get my clothes on and I  
 pack my bag,then I brush my teeth and 
 I go to school. At 9.00am we walk into
 school and sit down.We do reading and 
 sums,then we walk into the hall for   
 assembly.In assembly we sing and our  
 Headmaster tells us stories.We come   
 out of assembly and we have a         
 break,when we can go outside and run  
 about or play games.When we hear the  
 bell ringing we walk into school and  
 do some more work.At 12.00 noon we    
 have lunch after which we can play    
 until 1.15pm,then the bell rings to   
 begin lessons.We do mental tests,after
 which we will do either art,topic or  
 P.E.until school ends at 3.30pm.I go  
 home, eat my tea, then play or watch  
 TV until I go to bed at 9.45pm.       </content>
