		<content> Many street names in the area give    
 clues to the history of Braintree.    
 An estate of semi_detached houses is  
 named for the orchard which once      
 occupied the ground. Names include    
 Peartree Walk, Appletree Walk, Orchard
 Drive, Worcestor Close and Russett    
 Close.                                
 Aetheric Road is named after an Anglo 
 Saxon leader who fought against       
 invading Vikings at Maldon and who    
 died of his wounds.                   
 The Courtauld family were instumental 
 in Braintree's former prosperity and  
 have roads named after them.          
 John Ray Street commemorates the life 
 of one of Britain's earliest          
 naturalists who was born at Black     
 Notley.
