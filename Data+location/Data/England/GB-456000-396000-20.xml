 into the bathroom and has a wash then 
 he goes down stairs gets his shoes and
 coat on and goes to look at his       
 brothers cattle in the field. After he
 has looked at the cattle he goes back 
 home and has breakfast. Usually he    
 goes and gets the tractor and spray,  
 fills it with fungicide.From June he  
 fortnightly sprays the potaoes against
 blight.After spraying he washes the   
 sprayer and puts it away and goes to  
 have dinner. After dinner he goes and 
 works on the combine ready for        
 harvest. Then he goes to Plats for    
 some spare parts for the combine. By  
 the time he gets back it is time for  
 tea so he puts the spare parts ready  
 for tomorrow. After tea we let the    
 dogs out for a run. At different times
 of the year he harvests, burns stubble
