		<content>  Mattesons Meats is the second of the 
 larger companies to establish         
 themselves, while Joshua Wilsons      
 opened their food wholesale regional  
 distribution centre in the mid        
 nineteen sixties. On the debit side , 
 however, Bicklers have ceased to      
 operate and their buildings are now   
 being utilised as the base for a youth
 training scheme.                      
  The most significant recent          
 developments are twofold. Already in  
 operation is aself contained estate of
 36 small units which have been built  
 upon the former sports fieldof        
 Mackays. To open in the autumn of this
 year is a Fine Fare hyper-market on   
 land which has remained overgrown and 
 neglected for many years and is       
 adjacent to Mackays Carpet Factory.
