		<title>14     Redenham Park.</title>
		<content> Much of the area of the block is taken
 up by the two thousand{acres}which    
 comprise the{Redenham Park. }It is a  
 privately owned and run estate        
 engaged in forestry, animal husbandry 
 and general{farming. }There are six   
 hundred{acres}of woodland and         
 racehorses are bred and trained here. 
                                       
 The{farming}comprises cereal crops and
 cattle and to a large extent reflects 
 the wider aspect of the whole area.   
 There is a large private{house        
 approached by two long drives and     
 still remote from the{roads}and more  
 crowded civilisation even in these    
 over-populated days. There are many   
 fine examples of established specimen 
{trees}such as oak, cedar and sycamore.
  Many elms have disappeared, killed by
{Dutch Elm disease}which swept the     
 country during the nineteen-seventies.</content>
