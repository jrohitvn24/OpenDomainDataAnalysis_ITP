		<title>02Housing In Denaby Main</title>
		<content>  In 1967{Denaby}had been a mining     
 village for about 100 years. Dwellings
 had been built as a ribbon-development
 plan,very close together, in order to 
 house as many people as possible.     
 Conisbrough Urban District Council    
 decided on a slum-clearance programme 
 which would involve about 4,000 houses
 and 10,000 people: this represented   
 about 95% of the whole village. The   
 existing houses and land had first to 
 be purchased from the{National Coal   
{Board.}Important features of the 'new 
 village' are: senior citizens'        
 bungalows with gardens, disabled-     
 persons' units, communal halls,       
 shopping precincts, playing fields and
 a small ,industrial estate. This      
 unique scheme was completed by the {  
{Doncaster Metropolitan Borough        
{Council}in 1980.
