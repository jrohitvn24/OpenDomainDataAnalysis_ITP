		<content>   Theres about nine different types of
 schools and only three are compulsory.
 First school-which teaches you how to 
 read,write and play the recorder.     
 Middle school-which teaches English,  
 Science,Maths etc.Secondary school-   
 which teaches you more complicated    
 subjects.These are the only schools   
 you{have}to go to.All the others are  
 where you go out of choice.Now with   
 unemployment so high most people go to
 at least one of the places of Further 
 Education so they have more chance of 
 getting a job.                        
   Education has greatly improved but I
 think it will change and become a lot 
 better eg:The use of more personal    
 computers,More individual work rather 
 than class work.Maybe even a computer 
 teaching you and not a person. Maybe  
 even in the comfort of your own home  
 not at school.                        </content>
