		<title>09THE CHURCH IN LONGSTANTON</title>
		<content>   There are 2 {C.of E.}churches, All  
 Saints and St.Michaels. The latter (in
 the next D-Block) is a "Reduntant"    
 church, now seldom used. The All      
 Saints Rector also looks after All    
 Saints, Lolwoth. There are {Roman     
{Catholic }services at the Army Camp.  
 Our Methodist Chapel closed many years
 ago:the nearest non-conformist chapel 
 is the{Baptists'}Chapel  at Over.     
   A usual congregation at All Saints  
 would be 30 to 35 people. There are   
 many more at Christmas and Easter.    
 Communion is now from the{Alternative 
{Service Book (Rite A),}except for one 
 Sunday a month when the{1662}service  
 is retained.                          
 The Rector considers that many more   
 people are reached by the ministry    
 than actually attend church.
