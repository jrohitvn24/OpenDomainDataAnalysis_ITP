		<content> In my spare time I enjoy going        
 horse-riding. I go to a riding centre 
 every Sunday.                         
   I enjoy reading books about horse   
 adventures and I like boarding school 
 mysteries too.I also like watching    
 television. I don't like westerns or  
 the news, but I prefer comedies and   
 most other programs. I go swimming ,  
 usually once a week, with my friend.  
   In winter I like playing on my      
 family's computer. I like playing     
 board games and drawing. Also in      
 winter I watch more television.       
   My dad enjoys watching nature and   
 sport programmes on the television.He 
 also enjoys drinking at the Royal     
 British Legion.                       
    My mum enjoys knitting and watching
 films on television.
