 The textile company of Ashton Brothers
 is closely linked with the town of{   
{Hyde}and in particular the district of
{Flowery Field.}Here,the Ashton family 
 built the church and school (now      
 disused but still standing) and an    
 estate of several hundred houses for  
 it's employees.In 1881,when the town  
 was granted it's Borough Charter,{    
{Thomas Ashton}became it's first mayor.
 In 1905,the company became the first  
 in Europe to install automatic looms. 
 In{1985}the{Carrfield Mill}site at    
 Flowery Field employs{740}workers     
 although production is now limited    
 to plain dyed towels and babies'      
 nappies instead of the 27 items       
 advertised in the catalogue of 1961.
