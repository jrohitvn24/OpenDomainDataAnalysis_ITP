		<content>  BUILDINGS &amp; LANDSCAPE.               
   Buildings are scattered along the   
 main road;settlements are far too     
 small to qualify as villages.The local
 material is probably red sandstone,as 
 many cottages use this at least as a  
 base.Some of the larger houses are    
 nineteenth century,painted white.Both 
 of these types of buildings were      
 originally built for farm _           
 labourers.There are some modern       
 bungalows built for commuters.        
   The landscape is dominated          
 by farmland and a mixture of deciduous
 and evergreen trees,some of which line
 the main road.for most of the way     
 hedgerows line the road,with some     
 metal fencing.The landscape is        
 reasonably flat.The Welsh border hills
 can be seen from Upper Berwick        
 farm.Local people apreciate the       
 quiet,pleasant,gentle scenery.        </content>
