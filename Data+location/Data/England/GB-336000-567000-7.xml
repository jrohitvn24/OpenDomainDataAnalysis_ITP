		<title>07EMPLOYMENT IN LONGTOWN.</title>
		<content> Many inhabitants of Longtown have to  
 travel to Carlisle to their place of  
 work.The town itself has insufficient 
 employment to offer jobs for all.Of   
 those people who earn their living    
 locally,some are in the retail trade;a
 significant number in the transport   
 industry, a similar number work in a  
 local M.O.D. establishment.With the   
 area being predominately rural,some   
 workers find employment in            
 farming,though most local farms are   
 worked by father/son partnerships.    
 Traditional apprenticeships for       
 school-leavers are scarce,and many    
 young people join YTS schemes to      
 experience their first paid           
 employment.Young people generally are 
 reluctant to leave the area,and do not
 enter further education.Some do       
 however, join the armed services to   
 find stable employment.               </content>
