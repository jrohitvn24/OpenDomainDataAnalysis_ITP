{Larkenshaw Farm}has 51 acres. At the  
 moment they have 9{horses}because they
 only have one helper. Only Mrs        
 McAlister goes horse{riding,}but they 
 don't have a{riding school.}They do   
{breed horses}but only a little. They  
 train their horses for{dressage}and   
{show jumping.}They keep horses because
 they find them interesting and they   
 like them too. They have to get the   
 vet in roughly two to three times a   
 year. They think{hunting}for horses is
 a very good idea because they like    
 hunting. As well as horses they have  
 chickens, dogs, cats and cattle.
