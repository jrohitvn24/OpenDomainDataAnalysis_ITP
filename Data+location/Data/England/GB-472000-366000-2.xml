		<content> This predominantly rural area is      
 complicated by two factors:_          
    1: The history which is reflected  
 in the Medieval three field system    
 which is preserved and still operated 
 at Laxton.                            
    2: The oilfield which underlies the
 area.                                 
    The villages of Laxton, Egmanton   
 and Moorhouse are still very small and
 residential land use is secondary to  
 the farming user in terms of area     
 covered.                              
    The map shows that on the higher   
 land between 77 and 38 metres arable  
 crops including wheat, barley, oil    
 seed rape and rye are grown. On the   
 lower land between 30 and 16 metres in
 the valleys of the small streams,     
 grassland supports cattle and ponies. 
    The population of the area is less 
 than 500. 3 squares are uninhabited.  </content>
