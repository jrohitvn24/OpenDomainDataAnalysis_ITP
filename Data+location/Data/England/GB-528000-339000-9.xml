		<content> Farming is intense, many hedgerows and
 woods have been removed.              
 Rabbits, hares, pheasants, rats and   
 weasels have adapted to living in     
 these conditions.Flockingh birds such 
 as the crow, starling, sparrow and    
 seagull are seen in our fields and    
 following the plough. The fox, mole,  
 and hedgehog live in fields but are   
 adapting to life in gardens.          
{Birds}have adapted well to life with  
 man as woodlands reduce they live in  
 our gardens and on our houses.        
 Housemartins and bluetits are typical 
 and are in good numbers, at least 30  
 other species can be seen. Despite    
 crop sprays 7 species of{butterfly}   
 have been recorded.                   
 We must not forget domestic animals   
 dog, cat, pigeon, goose, rabbit, hen, 
 etc. Lets hope all species survive.
