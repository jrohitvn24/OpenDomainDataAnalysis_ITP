		<title>13Trails at the Country Park</title>
		<content>      Around Durlston Country Park     
 there are many trails which can be    
 followed with information to assist   
 the visitor, these include:           
                                       
 THE STONE TRAIL -  As its name        
 suggests this trail concentrates on   
 geology and Purbeck stone and its use 
 in the past; while drawing attention  
 to its use for stone walling          
 renovations taking place throughout   
 the Park at present.                  
                                       
 THE FARMLAND TRAIL - This new trail   
 was designed to encourage visitors to 
 explore the more remote area of the   
 Park. Much of this land is leased to  
 local farmers, but is managed by the  
 Park. Throughout this trail markers   
 with interesting titles such as "Hay  
 bales and Hoverflies","Foxes and      
 Fertilizers", can be seen.            </content>
