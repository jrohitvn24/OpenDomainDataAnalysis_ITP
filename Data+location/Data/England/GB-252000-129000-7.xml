 There were lots of memorial stones    
 each very carefully decorated and     
 completely different to the one next  
 to it. There were lots of figures     
 around in different places in the     
 church all with history. Pictures on  
 the walls, windows showed a different 
 picture story on each. In one of the  
 walls was carved a story of The Last  
 Supper with Jesus and his disciples   
 sitting round the table and Jesus     
 breaking the bread. That story on the 
 wall was one of the things I liked    
 best there. Tawstock church is very   
 beautiful as well as interesting.
