		<content>      This was founded in 1909.  The   
 club house was built by John Penn,    
 second son of William Penn in 1774.   
 Our questions about the club house    
 were answered by Mr. P. Lunn, the     
 caretaker.  It has about fifty rooms  
 and is a listed building.  The club   
 house has many works of art including 
 an Adam fireplace and sculpture       
 featured in Country Life magazine.    
      The course is 6642 yards long and
 measures 198 acres.  The longest holes
 are the first and thirteenth which    
 both measure 502 yards.  The course   
 record for eighteen holes is 65.  The 
 club has about 700 members and the    
 course is looked after by five people.
 In the professional's shop iron clubs 
 start at Â£15.95 and can be as much as 
 Â£65. Woods start at Â£19.95 and can be
