		<title>10HOUSES OLD AND NEW</title>
		<content>                                       
       Houses built this century       
 consist of grid-like roads lined with 
 terraces.These have rounded or square 
 bays,slate roofs or tiles,red-brick   
 walls,small forecourt,neat back garden
 conservatory.There is some new        
 sheltered housing for the old.        
 On the new housing estate, Anchorage  
 Park,houses are grouped in threes and 
 fours ,with narrow windows and front  
 gardens without fences.Interviews with
 residents reveal a liking for the     
 quiet environment,easy access out of  
 town (The Eastern Road connects with  
 the motorway),bigger gardens,and      
 comfort.Disadvantages include only one
 bus service,necessity of owning a     
 car,few facilities (just one community
 centre and pub),one post box,no       
 shops,and isolation.A new hypermarket 
 opens in 1986.                        </content>
