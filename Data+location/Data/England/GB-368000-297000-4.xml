		<title>04River Severn,Stockton Parish</title>
		<content> The River Severn,the longest river in 
 England,forms part of the western &amp;   
 southern parish boundary.It flows     
 lazily amid green fields &amp; wooded     
 slopes &amp; presents a beautiful aspect  
 to Apley Hall,which stands on its     
 north bank.The remains of an ancient  
 fish weir and barge gutter are to be  
 found,emphasizing the rivers          
 importance in history as a major      
 highway &amp; fishing river.At Apley Forge
 a small stream joins the Severn as a  
 right bank tributary.This,the Frog    
 Mill,provided a source of water power 
 for an iron forge in the 18th &amp; 19th  
 centurie, &amp; here cannon were forged   
 for Nelson's navy &amp; Wellington's army 
 at Waterloo.A little further upstream 
 at Willey Wharf,the world's first iron
 boat was launched by John Wilkinson.
