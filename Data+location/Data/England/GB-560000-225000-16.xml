 area and 6 farmhouses which are not   
 attached to farms.Most are arable     
 farms.Few farmers in the area have    
 livestock.We spoke to Christopher     
 Askew about farming.He is an arable   
 farmer.Mr Askew has 300 acres; his    
 largest field is 44 acres and his     
 smallest is 5.25 acres.Christopher    
 Askew manages the farm with one part- 
 time man.His grandfather started it   
 for his son just before the second    
 world war in 1939.When they first     
 started they had one tractor which was
 50hp,now tractors are 100hp.Mr.C.Askew
 grows Winter Wheat,Winter Barley,Peas 
 and Potatoes.He harvests them by him- 
 self with the part-time worker.Brick  
 House Farm is a pig farm and The Hyde 
 keeps cattle.Mr.C.Askew has 6 barns,2 
 are modern in which he stores grain   
 and in the other 4 he keeps machinery.</content>
