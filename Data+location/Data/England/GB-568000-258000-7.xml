		<title>07THE CHURCH REMAINS AND TREES</title>
		<content> There are some {church remains }in    
 Silverley a village which has been    
 knocked down near  Cheveley. Henry the
 Eighth told Thomas Cromwell to knock  
 down the church. The tower remained.  
{August 1971}the council told builders 
 to knock it down. Jim Claydon a       
 governor of our school got local      
 people to sign a petition to stop the 
 builders.It was saved. The tower has  
 arches at the back and front and you  
 can see part of the spiral staircase. 
 Birds nest there.                     
 There are trees around the remains:   
{Beech, Sycamore, Common Alder}and{Yew.
 We measured the height of the biggest 
 tree, a{Beech.}We used half metre and 
 metre sticks, put the metre stick     
 down, stood the half metre by it and  
 lined it up with the tree .The        
 distance  along the ground was {43m}so
 the height of the tree is{21.5}metres.</content>
