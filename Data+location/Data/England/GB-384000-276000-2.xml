		<content>{Link Detached.}My house is link       
 detched which means it is joined to   
 the next house by the garage.It is    
 made of brick and has twelve windows  
 and two doors.There are two           
 chimneys.The house is painted black   
 and white.The garage and the          
 decorative parts at the top of the    
 windows are black.Although the house  
 is made of bricks it is painted white.
{Semi Detached. }My semi detached house
 is mostly built of bricks but on the  
 front it has some varnished boards,   
 underneath the window of the lounge   
 and underneath my mom and dad's       
 bedroom window.The window frames are  
 white but the front door is just plain
 wood varnished.We have a small front  
 porch with a dustbin store and a      
 bigger porch at the back with a toilet
 in it.We have a small back and front  
 garden.                               </content>
