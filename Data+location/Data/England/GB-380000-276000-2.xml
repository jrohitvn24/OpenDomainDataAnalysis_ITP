		<content>{Mark (aged 11) interviews his "Nan"   
{(Grandmother) about her childhood     
{during the Second World War (1939-    
{1945).                                
 Mark: What was school like in those   
       days?                           
 Nan : Well, we sat on benches in      
       front of long desks which had   
       inkwells  set in them. There was
       a coke-burning stove to heat the
       classroom. The rooms were lit by
       oil lamps.                      
 Mark: What was it like during the war?
 Nan : There was food &amp; clothing       
       rationing; no street lights and 
       the cars used only dim lights.  
       Children were evacuated from    
       towns and cities and some people
       had air-raid shelters in their  
       gardens.                        
 Mark: How did you cook your food?     
 Nan : Food was cooked on an open fire.</content>
