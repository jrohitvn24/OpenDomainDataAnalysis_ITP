 We found out that when this company   
 started 8 years ago it only had 5     
 workers but now it has expanded to 20 
 employees. The company gets it's stock
 from all over the world. Two hundred  
 years ago on the same site there was a
 mill called Pen Mill after that the   
 name was changed to Chugley Mill. The 
 area they supply covers a 30 mile     
 radius. They are not that well known  
 in Britain because they are based in  
 the West Country.In the area they     
 supply 13 thousand members. They are  
 open 266 days a year. The area of     
 the building covers 3 acres and it has
 grown quite alot over the last 2      
 years. The things they sell covers a  
 wide range from agricultural          
 equipment,clothes,tools,seeds,garden  
 equipment and other things as well.
