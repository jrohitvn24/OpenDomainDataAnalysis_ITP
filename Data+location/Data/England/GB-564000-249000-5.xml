		<title>05Farming in Thurlow</title>
		<content> The land, part of a 13000 acre estate 
 formed originally by the buying up of 
 small farms is farmed 'in hand' by the
 owner and his estate manager, farm    
 manager and stockman, who all live in 
 this block. Shelter belts of evergreen
 and deciduous trees planted since 1940
 provide timber which is felled in     
 rotation with saplings replanted among
 existing trees, or clear felled and   
 completely replanted. Thinnings are   
 used for pulp wood, or rails and posts
 on the estate, and big timber is sold 
 commercially. The land, lowland clays,
 chalks and sandstones is very heavy   
 and once winter sets in becomes       
 impossible to work, so timeliness is  
 of the essence. This means that each  
 summer and autumn harvesting must be  
 finished promptly, a problem in a wet 
 summer, and the land ploughed and     
 harrowed in time to drill the seeds.  </content>
