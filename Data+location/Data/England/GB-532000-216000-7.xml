		<content>Youth Training Scheme has been employed
from time to time but this has not been
found satisfactory. Some have been keen
on the job but others less so and this 
has left a feeling against further     
involvement.                           
The recovery side of the business is   
run by Mr D Flack. He has three        
breakdown lorries capable of pulling   
loads of either 48tonnes,38tonnes or 68
tonnes. In the case of a breakdown the 
lorry concerned either contacts the    
company directly or one of the main    
organisations who in turn send the     
nearest company to the vehicle. This   
company was on the lists of Octogan    
Recovery and the National Breakdown    
Commercial Recovery Ltd.               
All the team take part in courses run  
to show the latest techniques in       
vehicle recovery. They are well trained
for what is sometimes dangerous work.  </content>
