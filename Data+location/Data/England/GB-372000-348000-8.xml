gardener.The activities done there are 
W.I.,Darby and Joan Club, Badminton,   
B.A.T.S,Cubs,Brownies,Playgroup,       
Auctions,Weddings and other functions. 
    It is 2.80 an hour to hire the     
hall and 2.00 pounds an hour for the   
committee room.There is a stage on     
which the B.A.T.S.do shows 2 or 3      
times a year.The money raised is all

committee organises a Bonfire and      
Firework display every year.
