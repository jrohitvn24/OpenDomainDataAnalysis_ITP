		<title>02EMPLOYMENT IN PRUDHOE</title>
		<content> We surveyed on employment in Prudhoe. 
 We asked the pupils at school whether 
 they had parents working either at    
 Kimberly Clark Paper Fractory or      
 Prudhoe Hospital for mentally         
 handicapped. These places employ the  
 most people in Prodhoe.               
 These are our results:                
 Parents employed by Kimberly Clark 24%
 Parents employed by Prudhoe Hospital  
 26%                                   
 Other places which employ large       
 numbers of people are:                
 Finnigans Paint Works, The Falcon     
 Restaurant and Public House, Unifibres
 Paper Works, Insu Insulation,         
 Thompsons Garage and Haulage and      
 Tynedale District Council.            
 In Prudhoe many people (especially    
 school leavers) are unemployed. This  
 might be because of workforce cutbacks
 and the closing down of factories.    </content>
