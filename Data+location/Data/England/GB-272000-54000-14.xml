		<title>14DIPTFORD HAPPENINGS</title>
		<content> Beating the Bounds is run every nine  
 years in aid of Cancer Relief and St. 
 Mary's Church Diptford. It used to be 
 held so people would know where the { 
 boundary  stones were. People used to 
 take other younger people, so as the  
 generations went by, somebody would   
 know where the boudary was. At the {  
{Fun} evening there are lots of games  
 for children and adults. We have the  
 fun evening at Diptford playing       
 fields. There are hotdogs to buy, we  
 have a sing song and to finish off the
 evening there are some fireworks.Each 
 year a Horticultural {show}is held in 
 a huge marquee where Flowers,         
 Vegetables, cakes and crafts are on   
 display for all to see. Outside stalls
 and games are organised. Everyone     
 enjoys the Dog Show. In the evening   
 the villagers come to the Barn{Dance} 
 to end the happy day.                 </content>
