 Services are held in the church every 
 Sunday. These are usually taken by the
 Vicar. The main service is held on the
 first Sunday in the month, when a     
 Family Communion service is held. The 
 children go to a Sunday School at the 
 same time as the service is held in   
 the church. They come in to the church
 during the offertory and go to the    
 Altar rail for blessing before the    
 adults receive communion. This has    
 proved a very worthwhile service and  
 congregations of 70 people usually    
 attend.                               
 The vicar is the Rev. Frank Hung who  
 is the first Non-European to be a     
 vicar in the Salisbury Diocese. He was
 born in China and came to England when
 he was two years old.                 
 A new floor is being put into the     
 church as the old one was rotting.    </content>
