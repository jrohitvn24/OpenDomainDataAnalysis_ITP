		<title>02Farming in the Horton Area</title>
		<content> Horton is a mainly farming community, 
 the area is prime dairy land due to   
 it's flat rolling fields of lush green
 grass.Being in the West Country it    
 enjoys warm,damp weather which        
 encourages growth.                    
     On the farms some cereal crops    
 are grown such as wheat and barley.Hay
 is also grown for animals to feed on, 
 vegetables can also be bought at the  
 farms and considering there are no    
 shops in Horton to buy groceries this 
 is a good ideal.                      
     The milking starts at around      
 six am and then sometime in the day   
 the CO-OP Dairy Company comes to      
 collect the milk.In Horton there is an
 agricultural engineering company who  
 sell farm machinery.Some farmland     
 nowadays is used for other things such
 as camping.                           
                                       </content>
