		<content>   There is no local public transport  
 in the area;a loal GWR Branch line    
 closed in 1966.There are no scheduled 
 bus routes,only a long distance coach 
 to London or Bristol along the A361.  
 From the Oakford area a Community     
 bus goes weekly to market at Tiverton 
 &amp; will call at farms if asked to by   
 telephone.Dulverton Community bus goes
 weekly to Minehead and monthly to     
 South Molton.                         
   Farmers hire lorries to take animals
 to markets or sales;most have cars,   
 tractors and land rovers,some also run
 a van or pickup truck.Some households 
 own horse-boxes.Only three cottages   
 have no motorised transport, one of   
 these using cycles.Altogether there   
 were probably over 50 cars,about 6    
 landrovers,several vans and trucks,5  
 motorbikes and 6 bicycles,1 motorbike 
 used for motocross.Tractors used too. </content>
