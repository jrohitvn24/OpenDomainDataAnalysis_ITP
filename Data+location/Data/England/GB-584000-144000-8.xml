		<content> This rural section of ENGLAND is      
 mainly Agricultural.It is situated in 
 the middle of the{WEALD of KENT,}to   
 the East of the busy but attractive   
 village of HEADCORN and is mostly     
 contained within that Parish.Sheltered
 by a ridge to the North, the land     
 appears flat when approached from that
 direction but it is undulating country
 side, with hedge-lined fields and     
 winding lanes.{Trees}are plentiful;   
 some being protected by{Conservation }
 orders to prevent the destruction of  
 the remaining decendants of the great 
 FOREST OF ANDREDA which once covered  
 this area. The patchwork of fields is 
 puncuated with numerous small{Ponds,} 
 some hidden by groups of Willow or    
 undergrowth,and{Public footpaths}cross
 the meadows connecting the farms. Old 
 Farmhouses and Oasts complete the land
 scape,which is pleasing in all Seasons</content>
