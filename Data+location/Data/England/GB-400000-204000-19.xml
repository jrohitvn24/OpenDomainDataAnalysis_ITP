		<title>19RICHARD AT PLAY.</title>
		<content>  In the evenings I often play in the  
 allotments.We play block which is a   
 game where 1 person is counting and   
 the others are hiding.                
  We also play on the mudpile which has
 been left from the foundations of the 
 new houses. On one side of the mudpile
 there is a limb of a tree which we    
 use as a swing. We've made a base     
 near the mudpile. It's by fir trees   
 which we climb up and use as a look   
 out. The main part of the base is the 
 rain shelter. This is where someone   
 has dumped some plastic and we've made
 a shelter from it.                    
  Each time we go to the mudpile we    
 play a game of spying, army or S.A.S. 
 They are types of war games but we use
 sticks for guns.                      
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
