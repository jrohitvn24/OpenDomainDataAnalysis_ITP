		<content> At home we have our certain jobs to   
 do. I have to get tea, wash the dishes
 and make the beds. My family lives on 
 a farm. In our home we have two       
 kitchens, three sitting rooms, two    
 bath rooms, one larder and five       
 bedrooms.                             
 On our farm we keep dairy cows, beef  
 cattle, sheep and lambs for meat and  
 wool.                                 
 We have cereals or fry for breakfast. 
 Fry is eggs, bacon, sausages and      
 mashed potatoes. Eggs come from hens, 
 bacon comes from an animal called a   
 pig and sausages are also made with   
 meat from a pig. For dinner we have   
 roast meat and vegetables and for tea 
 we have pasty, cakes, tart or in      
 summer strawberries and cream. For    
 supper we have crisps.
