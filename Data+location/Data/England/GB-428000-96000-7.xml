		<content>  Those working full-time work from 7am
 to 4pm and have 4 weeks holiday a     
 year. They work a 5 day week.         
  They use 100-150 grammes of tomato   
 seeds a year and the{tomatoes}take    
 approximately 11 months to grow. About
 120 tonnes of fruit are produced per  
 acre. They have a special watering    
 device called a trickle waterer. It is
 a little pipe attached to a large pipe
 which drips water every few seconds.  
 Machines are now used to grade the    
 tomatoes into different sizes;before, 
 they used cardboard with holes cut    
 out. Each box has the size of tomatoes
 stamped on it, the most common size   
 being 47-57mm. They keep a record of  
 what they grow and turn the heating   
 off during hot days. They have adapted
 with the times, originally growing    
{strawberries}which eventually suffered
 the disastrous effect of{red core}.   </content>
