		<content> In 1220, in the reign of Henry III, a 
 new kind of monk appeared in Derby    
 Market Place; dressed in a black cloak
 with a bowl hanging at the girdle,    
 talking in the ordinary language of   
 the people. He was a friar, a follower
 of St. Dominic. The friars went into  
 Derby and surrounding villages        
 preaching and tending the sick. They  
 lived by begging, owning nothing      
 themselves, but serving only God and  
 the people. They probably preached at 
 the Headless Cross on Ashbourne Road  
 and brought the Word of God to the    
 ordinary people of Derby. The Black   
 Friars built a friary in what is now  
 Friargate (Freregate 1342) where the  
 Friary Hotel now stands. This along   
 with other religious houses was       
 dissolved by Henry VIII in 1534/5. The
 friars had worked in Derby for over   
 300 years.                            </content>
