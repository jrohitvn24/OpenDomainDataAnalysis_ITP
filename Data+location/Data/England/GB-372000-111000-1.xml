		<content>   This area of Dorset is a typically  
 rural one, much of the land being     
 common and farm land.Away from the    
 A357 and the A3030 it is very         
 quiet,fairly open countryside, which  
 has lost a great many of its elm trees
 in the last few years because of the  
 spread of Dutch elm disease.In the    
 hedgerows the dead trees which have   
 not been cut down look like winter    
 skeletons throughout the year.        
   The River Lydden crosses the        
 block never really becoming more than 
 a big stream.                         
   Unless one had specific business in 
 this area it is really only           
 countryside that one would pass       
 through.
