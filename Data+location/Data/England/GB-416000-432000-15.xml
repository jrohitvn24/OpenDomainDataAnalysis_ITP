		<title>15WAPPING SCHOOL POOL BRADFORD</title>
		<content>    Wapping Swimming Pool  is {over 100
{years old. }It was the {first swimming
{pool to be built in Bradford.      }  
                                       
    Our school, Wapping  First  School,
 still uses it. Three different classes
 and  the  nursery children  with their
 mums  visit  the pool each week.   Two
 other   schools   nearby   also   have
 swimming lessons in the pool.         
                                       
    Several Bradford South  Scout &amp; Cub
 Groups use the pool  for {swimming and
{canoeing.}A football club, Ventus Utd,
 use it too!                           
                                       
   The pool is 14 metres long, 5 metres
 wide and there are two changing rooms.
 It  isn't  very big  or deep  but it's
 warm and we love to swim!
