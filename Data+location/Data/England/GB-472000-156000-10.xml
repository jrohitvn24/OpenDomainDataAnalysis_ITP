		<content>{There are no shops in the block.}For  
 everyday items residents travel to    
 Hook, Hartley Wintney, Fleet or       
 Yateley. Some go to the village shop  
 at Rotherwick which is also the       
 nearest Post Office. For larger items 
 they have to go to Basingstoke, Fleet,
 Reading or elsewhere. Most of the     
 trade within the block is done in the 
 two public houses,{'The Leather       
{Bottle'}at Mattingley &amp;{'The Old Mill 
{Inn'}at Dipley - the former is        
 particularly popular at weekends.     
   Eggs, fruit &amp; other{farm produce}is 
 sold in season. On the edge of Hazeley
 Heath is{Wedgewood Farm Licensed      
{Boarding Kennels}which has been in    
 business since 1982. They usually have
 about 30 dogs staying for anything up 
 to several months if their owners have
 gone abroad.
