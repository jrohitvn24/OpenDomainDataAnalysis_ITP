		<content> Sewerby Hall is a beautiful Georgian  
 stately house that has been added to  
 in recent years. It stands amongst    
 colourful gardens and extensive       
 parkland. Once a private residence, it
 is now owned by East Yorkshire Borough
 Council and is open as a leisure      
 amenity. The house contains an art    
 gallery, museum &amp; the area teachers'  
 centre. The art gallery contains no   
 famous paintings but some fine works, 
 several by local artists. Each year   
 the gallery accommodates the local art
 exhibition. The museum is divided into
 natural history, archeology which     
 consists of finds from the surrounding
 area &amp; the Amy Johnson room, which    
 contains exhibits &amp; memorabilia of the
 famous woman air pilot. The teachers' 
 centre contains information &amp; study   
 packs for local teachers and visiting 
 schools.                              </content>
