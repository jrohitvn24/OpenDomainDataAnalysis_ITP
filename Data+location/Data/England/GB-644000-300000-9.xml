		<title>09BURGH CASTLE CHURCH</title>
		<content>   The lovely church of St.Peter and   
 St.Paul at Burgh Castle forms half of 
 the 'living' for the rector, with the 
 similiar building in Belton.Both have 
 the round tower which is usually an   
 indication that in former days the    
 parish could not afford expensive     
 imported materials.The base of the    
 tower was built from flint and tiles  
 taken from the nearby Roman fort.The  
 gables show clearly that the roof was 
 originally thatched.Inside several    
 phases of construction may be seen,the
 most interesting of which is the now  
 redundant staircase which once led to 
 a rood gallery.The church dates back  
 to 7th Century and was founded by the 
 Irish missionary St.Fursey.A Celtic   
 cross in the churchyard bares a gaelic
 inscription in his memory.
