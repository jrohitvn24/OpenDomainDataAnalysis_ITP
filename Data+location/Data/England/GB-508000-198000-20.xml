		<title>20North Watford Group.</title>
		<content>The research was carried out by 4      
schools in the North Watford area in   
the summer term 1985.  Approximately   
120 children took part and a large     
group of parents helped collect the    
information.  The teachers taking part 
included Maureen Martindale from Holy  
Rood JM., Gillian Flitt from Walter de 
Merton (after September 1985 to be     
known as Beechfield JMI), Ken Heaton   
from Lea Farm JM and Carol Dunford and 
Ian Gibson from Parkgate JM.  There    
were two disks made by the group.  The 
BBC disk was edited and typed up by Ken
Heaton and his class 4H at Lea Farm    
School.  The RML 480Z disk was edited  
and typed up by Ian Gibson at Parkgate 
JM School.                             
Just a thought..Watford had its wettest
June for many years whilst we were     
collecting the information. How was the
weather 900 years ago?                 </content>
