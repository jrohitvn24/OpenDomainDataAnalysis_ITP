		<title>01Braithwell-Stainton-Survey</title>
		<content> The land within the boundaries of our 
 Domesday Survey is predominantly an   
 area of farmland.Most of the land is  
 arable,the main crops being cereal,   
 rape and sugar beet.There is some     
 dairy farming of mainly Friesian      
 herds.The population of the area is   
 approximately 1110,centred around the 
 two villages of Braithwell and        
 Stainton.In the North East are small  
 patches of woodland.Limestone is the  
 dominant rock,dipping to the East.In  
 the 19th century Ruddle was an        
 important mineral.Limestone is now    
 quarried mainly for road building.    
 Maltby Main Colliery lies on          
 the Southern boundary and the Barnsley
 Seam lies under much of the area at a 
 depth of 757 metres.The M18 cuts      
 across the North west corner section. 
 The major road is the B6376.
