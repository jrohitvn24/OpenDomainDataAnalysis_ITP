		<content> A religious sect, founded in 1954 by  
 american R Hubbard, the Church of     
 Scientology, has its headquarters at  
 Saint Hill Manor, a secluded country  
 estate on the edge of East Grinstead. 
 Over 400 adults study courses on      
 spiritual counselling, management     
 technology and self improvement, which
 they believe enables them to get more 
 out of life. What is Scientology? They
 believe "Man is regarded as a         
 spiritual being and once he is        
 understood in this light, his life &amp;  
 abilities are improved by helping him 
 become more aware of his true nature. 
 Scientology has severe critics in many
 countries as experts feel it can      
 adversely affect the mental health of 
 students.The sect has been banned in  
 several countries and a ban on foreign
 Scientology students entering the     
 United Kingdom is still in force.     </content>
