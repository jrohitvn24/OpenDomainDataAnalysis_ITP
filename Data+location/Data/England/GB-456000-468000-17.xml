		<title>17Old Village School</title>
		<content> Old school in Crayke was opened on New
 Years DAy 1846, from the design of Mr 
 Jones, architect, York. The  opening  
 day was celebrated by a service in the
 Village Church (it was the Festival of
 the Circumcision).                    
 At 12 the school room was prepared    
 with a feast including plum pudding   
 and roast beef for the thirty seven   
 girls and thirty five boys. The school
 building was paid for by Rev Churton, 
 Dr Whytehead and other benevolent     
 individuals for the free education of 
 boys. It closed on 23 March 1973 when 
 a new school was built on Easingwold  
 Rd. The old school is now used as a   
 village hall and play group. Some of  
 the names which came up on the old    
 register which are still in school, or
 in the village today, are Gilleard,   
 Knowles, Leckenby, Jackson and Dennis.
