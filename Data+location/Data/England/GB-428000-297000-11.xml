		<title>11VISIT TO THE LOCK</title>
		<content>It was raining hard when we arrived at 
the canal.We walked along the tow-path 
until we met Mr Gammie,the lock keeper.
We soon learnt there were as many as 11
locks in the Atherstone district.It    
took around ten minutes for a boat to  
get through a lock.Industries used the 
canals,especially coal mining.Today    
only 4 coal boats go up and down the   
canal.There are around 24 barges and   
boats passing through Atherstone each  
day,now they are nearly all holiday    
makers.Locks can be very dangerous.With
all our questions answered we went back
out in the rain to the first lock.Mr   
Gammie wound the lock and we pushed the
large gate open and all the water      
rushed in.The water level soon became  
the same, that is when the boat could  
pass through.After taking photographs  
under the bridge we left.
