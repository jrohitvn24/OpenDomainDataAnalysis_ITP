		<content> There are three main areas of         
 residential accommodation:{the main   
{town,}bordered by the Thanet Way, the 
 villages of {Herne}and{Broomfield,}and
 a development south of the Thanet Way 
 known as {Greenhill}. The central town
 comprises mainly second world war     
 houses.Whereas {Herne,Broomfield and  
{Greenhill}have many modern houses     
 built on new estates surrounding older
 village housing.                      
 45%of properties surveyed were over 30
 year old whilst 55% were newer. At    
 houses surveyed 69% of the people had 
 lived in their homes less than 10 yrs,
 this being consistant with the        
 increase in new residential areas.    
 91% of the properties belonged to     
 owner occupiers, only 9% was rented   
 accommodation.
