		<title>15Ancient Uyeasound.</title>
		<content> Some tourists come to Uyeasound to see
 the ancient remains which illustrate  
 our early history.                    
   Cairns are Stone-Age burial         
 chambers.They are found nowhere else  
 in Britain except Shetland.One can be 
 found on Gallow Hill and another at   
 the Loch of Snabrough.                
   Brochs date from over a thousand    
 years ago.They were built as defences 
 and the one to be found on north side 
 of the Loch of Snabrough overlooks    
 Bluemull Sound which is a known Viking
 routeway.                             
   At Belmont on the approach to Gallow
 Hill is the site of a Norse           
 Farmstead,probably built about 800    
 A.D.This shows that the Vikings       
 settled in Unst and did not only use  
 it as a stopping-off point on their   
 way to the Western Isles and Ireland.
