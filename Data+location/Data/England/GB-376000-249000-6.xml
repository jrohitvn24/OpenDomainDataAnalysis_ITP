 he taught himself his skill.He went to
 college and took O levels,the national
 certificate and more.He is the only   
 person in his family to be a          
 blacksmith.Mr Shaw makes              
 plaques,letterboxes,cookerhoods and   
 fires.The plaques cost Â£35-Â£45 and the
 brass ones cost from Â£45_Â£60.The      
 letterboxes cost Â£85_Â£100.In the      
 winter he has more calls for fires.In 
 the summer he really sells plaques.He 
 makes alot of fires.Mr Shaw gets his  
 materials from Worcester, Malvern,
