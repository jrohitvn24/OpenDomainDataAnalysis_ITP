		<title>17Attitudes in S'key&amp;C'thorpe.</title>
		<content>{Local pride}in past; love of marshes  
 and village. People friendly to       
 strangers but protect privacy. Approve
 conservation that does not conflict   
 with ancient rights; find low-flying  
 aircraft a nuisance and a             
 contradiction.                        
{Newcomers}who blend in unobtrusively  
 tolerated but inflated house prices   
 resented since outsiders buy and do up
 old cottages while young and old of   
 village have nowhere to live.         
{Change:}Social Club and new shop      
 welcomed, provide real community      
 service for young and elderly. Not    
 many church-goers. Closing of school  
 and chapel regretted. Both once       
 essential part of village life but    
 neither sufficiently used to be       
 maintained. New owners of Chapel said 
 to contribute much to villge life.    
 Newcomers tend to be enthusiastic.    </content>
