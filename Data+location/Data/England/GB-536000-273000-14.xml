		<title>14HISTORY OF EARITH</title>
		<content>{Earith's}name is based from Hithe,    
 which means a{landing place.} When you
 come down the{River Ouse}you can stop 
 at Earith where the land is higher    
 than the fens around. Earith is called
{"The Gateway to the Fens"}because as  
 boats get to Earith they enter the    
{Fens.}The Romans were some of the     
 first settlers.They used the river for
{washing, drinking, cooking}and{goods  
{transportation.}They ate wild fowl,   
 eels, fish and other small animals.   
 This position on the river helped with
 their defense. After the romans left, 
 other settlers came using the local   
 building materials, food and water.   
 Soon,  Earith became important because
 of its markets. In 1318,{The Bishop of
{Ely}gave permission for a{weekly      
{market}and{regular fairs.}
