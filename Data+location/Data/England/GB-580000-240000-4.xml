		<content>{Tourism.}The area has several         
 beautiful houses and cottages dating  
 from the 14th Century most of which   
 simply                                
 loved and lived in family homes.      
   The only house open to the public is
 Belchamp Hall, Belchamp Walter built  
 in 1720 by the third John Raymond and 
 still lived in by his direct          
 descendants. The Raymonds came to live
 in Belchamp Walter in Norman times.   
 The house is open by appointment only 
 and seems to be usually visited by    
 coachloads of American Tourist.       
   Near the house are a set of old     
 stables, converted during the 1939-45 
 war to a cow house and in 1984        
 converted to an Exhibition Room and   
 Art Gallery.
