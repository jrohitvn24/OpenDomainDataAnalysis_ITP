		<title>11Social Concerns in Parbold</title>
		<content>{       }A committee was formed some   
 years ago to find out from the        
 residents how they wanted their       
 village to look in the near future.   
 The general view was that Parbold     
 could be improved by the provision of 
 more facilities but that it should    
 remain basically a residential        
 village.                              
{Traffic:}Problems were noted about    
 increased traffic to the M6 passing   
 through the village and the increased 
 potential for accidents.Parking within
 the village was causing concern, as   
 the high car ownership put pressure on
 lack of space.                        
{Pollution:}There is concern about     
 smells from the sewage works, slurry  
 spraying, and the Mill, with some     
 improvement over recent years.Nuisance
 from dogs was noted, as was rubbish   
 and half-submerged boats in the canal.</content>
