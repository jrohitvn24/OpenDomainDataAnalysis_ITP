 At the heart of the centre of Cannock 
is the Parish Church of St Luke.       
According to church records it was     
founded early as 1143 and had a chantry
and a grammar school linked with it.   
 The oldest remaining part of the      
church is the church tower,which dates 
from the 14th century.                 
 The church was extended in 1878 by two
bays and a chancel. In 1949 a lovely   
war memorial chapel was added to the   
south side.                            
 Alongside the church is the church    
centre which is well fitted and        
furnished and has all the facilities   
for the social needs of the parish,as  
well as administrative block.
