		<title>15THE MARKET SQUARE,HARLOW.</title>
		<content>  There has been a{market square}in the
 town for about{25}years.Most stalls   
 are set up 4 days a week (Tues.Thurs. 
 Fri.Sat.)to sell clothes,jewellery,   
 fruit/veg.,records and make-up.       
 They take about two to four hours each
 time to assemble.                     
 Most of the shoppers say they prefer  
 the market because there is more      
 variety and it is cheaper. Most       
 travel to the market by car or        
 motorbike.                            
 Many people would like improvements:  
 changing rooms in the clothes stalls; 
 more variety of stalls;wider choice of
 clothes;fully covered walkways.       
 Some trade has been lost since the    
{Harvey Centre}was opened in{1982}and a
 few stallholders have taken their     
 trade elsewhere. About eight of the   
 original stalls from the 1960s are    
 still there.                          </content>
