		<content> In the centre of Purbrook Village,next
 to the church is {PURBROOK CHURCH OF  
{ENGLAND FIRST SCHOOL.} This school was
 built more than a hundred years ago in
 the 19th Century is still used as a   
 state school for children between 5   
 and 8. There are 53 children in the   
 school with two members of staff, a   
 headteacher and one other member of   
 staff.  There is only one large main  
 classroom in use but small            
 room,originally used as living        
 quarters for the headteacher,are now  
 used for smaller groups of children.  
 There is a very small playground for  
 the children to play in,a small office
 and a headteacher's room. The children
 mainly live near to the school and are
 able to walk to school every day. When
 they leave the school most of them go 
 to the local Middle School nearby.
