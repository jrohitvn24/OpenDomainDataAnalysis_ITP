		<content>   Arable crops cover, by far, the     
 largest area in our sector. Winter    
 cereals account for about three-      
 quarters of this area with winter     
 wheat, grown for the milling industry,
 the largest single crop. Other winter 
 cereals include barley for animal feed
 and oats for porridge. Spring barley, 
 mainly for the brewing industry, is   
 the only spring cereal. Other arable  
 crops include oilseed rape, peas,     
 beans, maize and lupins, a very new   
 crop to British farming and used for  
 oil.                                  
   The farmer uses modern machinery to 
 plough and sow and the harvesting is  
 done by combine harvester. The farmer 
 also grows grass for cattle. The one  
 dairy herd, 120 Friesians, graze in   
 the summer but in the winter they are 
 kept inside and fed on silage. Hay is 
 made on the farms in the summer.      </content>
