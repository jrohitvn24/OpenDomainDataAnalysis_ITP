		<content>   In the eighties one of societies    
 biggest problems was brought to       
 light,soccer violence.This year alone 
 there were horrific scenes at the     
 Luton v Millwall cup tie,violence in  
 which a wall collapsed and killed a   
 15 year old boy. There was the        
 tradedy of the European Cup Final     
 between Liverpool and Juventus when 48
 died because a wall collapsed at the  
 Hienzel Stadium in Brussels.For FIFA  
 this was the last straw and they      
 promptly banned English clubs from    
 playing in Europe indefinitely.       
   On the bright side there was NASAs  
 space shuttle,the first reusable space
 vehicle,it proved a great success     
 until it muffed a few satellite       
 launches.Sir Clive Sinclair had a     
 massive success with the ZX SPECTRUM  
 computer.
