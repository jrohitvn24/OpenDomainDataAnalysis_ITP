		<content> St. Julian's is a lay Christian       
 Community founded by Florence         
 Allshorn in 1941.  Named after the    
 Sussex saint of hospitality, St.      
 Julian's Guest House offers bodily and
 spiritual refreshment in beautiful,   
 peaceful surroundings in 8 acres of   
 lakeside grounds.                     
 The small, simple, wooden chapel, with
 straw covered floor, has a glass wall 
 behind the altar giving everchanging  
 views of trees, leaves and light.     
 Guests enjoy silent mealtimes,        
 breakfast in bed, wholesome food and  
 fresh milk. There are 16 rooms for 23 
 guests. The Community lives in the    
 main house and outbuildings. It owns  
 Farleys House for self catering       
 groups, cottages and a tenanted farm. 
 Weekly charges - full Â£84, clergy and 
 professional church workers Â£56 and   
 low income guests Â£28.                </content>
