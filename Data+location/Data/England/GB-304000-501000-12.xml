		<content>  I went to Casualty Department to have
 my finger X-Rayed.Then the doctor     
 bandaged my finger using my little    
 finger as a splint.I had to go back   
 the next week for the doctor to check 
 it was alright.In about three months  
 my finger had healed.                 
  Most people go to the Clinic when    
 they are ill. There are four Doctors, 
 one of whom is a lady. If the Doctor  
 thinks you need some medicine you go  
 to the counter in the waiting room and
 the lady Pharmacist gives you what you
 need.There are several Nurses as well 
 who help the Doctors.                 
  There is also a dentist at the Clinic
 but most people go to have their teeth
 filled by other Dentists,at Sellafield
 or Egremont. Sometimes you have to see
 someone at the Hospital if your teeth 
 are growing crooked.
