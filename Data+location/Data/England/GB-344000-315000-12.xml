		<title>12THE ISLE CONT'D.</title>
		<content> Most of the dwelling places still     
 visible date back no further than the 
 19th Century.They are built of red    
 brick with several houses being       
 decorated with yellow or black brick. 
 Most of the houses appear to have been
 farm labourers cottages &amp; are semi-   
 detached.Some are the farmers'houses. 
 The biggest house looks Georgian &amp; has
 a walled garden and tennis court.Next 
 tothis is a much older black and white
 timbered house.The buildings around it
 vary-some are old barns &amp; stables,one 
 withthe date 1874 in coloured         
 tiles on the roof;some others are     
 clearly modern,such as the Dutch      
 Barn.                                 
 One pair of cottages near Park Lane   
 has the date 1928.
