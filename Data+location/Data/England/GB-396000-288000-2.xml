		<content>                                       
  It is surprising to find a farm in   
 the heart of the Black Country.       
 Portway Farm is situated on Portway   
 Hill, approximately one and a half    
 miles S.W. of Oldbury town centre.    
  The black and white farmhouse is one 
 of the oldest buildings in the area.  
 Parts of the building date back to the
 1400's, with additions made in the    
 sixteenth century. It is built of     
 wattle and daub and was a Tudor coach 
 station.                              
  The farm covers an area of 25 acres  
 and is managed by the farmer and his  
 wife with two helpers on the          
 governmment Youth Opportunities       
 Programme.                            
  No crops are grown on the farm. The  
 farmer keeps up to 40 beef cattle,    
 10,000 deep litter hens and 12 horses,
 which form part of a riding stable.   </content>
