		<title>17A CHILD IN COOKSMILL GREEN</title>
		<content> My sister and live too far away from  
 our school to walk.We are taken by a  
{school bus.}We never know exactly     
 when it will come.It can come at 8.30 
 or at 8.55.We wait at our gate and we 
 can see Zita up the lane waiting with 
 her mum.The coach comes with the hand-
 icapped children because it takes them
 to their special school as well.Last  
 Winter in the snow it got stuck out-  
 side our house.Our headmaster had to  
 come and get us.There are no other    
 boys of my age to play with near me.I 
 wish my school friends were nearer.I  
 go to cubs at Roxwell.At school my    
 best game is Buzz.This is how we play 
 it.A group of children get together   
 and count up to 7.The one who is IT   
 has to get someone off an obstacle.If 
 the person calls "Buzz" you have to   
 get off and run away.If you are caught
 you are IT and the game goes on.      </content>
