		<title>13ORWELL PARK SCHOOL</title>
		<content> Orwell Park used to be the home of    
Admiral Vernon,who introduced Grog to  
the Royal Navy. It passed into the     
Tomlin family. Colonel Tomlin built the
railway line to Felixstowe so that it  
could rival Harwich as a port. Now it  
is a Preparatory Boarding School for   
boys aged 6 to 13. The curriculum is   
similar to that of a State School with 
the addition of Latin,French, German   
and Greek. There are excellent         
facilities for Sports and activities.  
Music practice rooms have been built in
the cellars and every boy learns to    
play a musical instrument. To save     
money each boy has to do ten minutes   
housework daily.When they leave, the   
boys usually go to Public Schools.     
 In the dome there is the seventh      
largest privately owned telescope in   
Great Britain. This belongs to the     
Ipswich Astrological Society.          </content>
