		<content> Some two miles by road from Coverack, 
 on the road crossing Crousa Downs     
 between Penhallick and St. Keverne,   
 stands{a rock}about which there is a  
{strange legend.}It is called{Tide     
{Rock,}and is simply an ordinary rock  
 protruding from the ground, which has 
 a small hollow in the upper surface.  
 This hollow invariably contains some  
 water. Legend has it that the state of
 the tide can be predicted according to
{the amount of water in the hollow;    
 when the tide is in the hollow is     
 full, and conversely, when the tide is
 out very little water is to be found  
 in the rock. It is also said that{the 
{water in the hollow is as salty as the
{sea.}Since the water is very murky and
 appears most unpalatable, I leave it  
 to the truly inquisitive to discover  
 whether this really is so.
