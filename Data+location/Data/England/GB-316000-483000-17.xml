		<content> The railway station in our area is    
 called Green Road Station. It is an   
 unmanned station. Eleven trains pass  
 through it towards Millom every day,  
 except Sunday when no passenger trains
 travel on this line. The line goes    
 from Barrow to Carlisle. Some trains  
 only go as far as Millom, others go   
 to Carlisle. On Monday to Friday 13   
 trains go through Green Road Station  
 towards Barrow. On Saturday, 11 go to 
 Barrow and there are no passenger     
 trains on Sunday.                     
 23% of households interviewed said    
 they regularly used the train service 
 from Green Road Station. Of this 23%, 
 a half of the people used it for      
 shopping, 30% used it for work and 20%

 If you want the train to stop you have
 to signal to the driver.
