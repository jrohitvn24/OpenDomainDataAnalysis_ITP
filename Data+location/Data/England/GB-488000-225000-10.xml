		<content> The Grand Union Canal, opened in 1800,
 passes through Leighton/Linslade. It  
 was built for conveying coal from     
 Braunston Junction to London. The     
 railway soon replaced the canal for   
 haulage. This year enthusiasts have   
 transported 200 tons of coal(6 boats) 
 through Linslade but the majority of  
 the 4540 boat movements were for      
 leisure purposes.                     
 Leighton/Linslade has a main-line     
 railway station. The electrified      
 railway links Glasgow and Manchester  
 to London and was built in 1839, for  
 the haulage of coal. It also carried  
 sand quarried from this area. The     
 train and the geological deposits in  
 the area are the main factors         
 responsible for the growth of the     
 town. Many commuters live in the town,
 some 2750 people using the 113 train  
 which stop at the station daily.      </content>
