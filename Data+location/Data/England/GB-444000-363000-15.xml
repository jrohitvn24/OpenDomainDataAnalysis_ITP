		<title>15ECOLOGY AT HARDWICK</title>
		<content>  The fact that much of the area around
 Hardwick Hall is owned by the National
 Trust means that there are many       
 designated{conservation sites}and     
 schemes.                              
  The{weather and climate is typical   
 for this part of north-east           
 Derbyshire.{Rain}is the predominant   
 element, with occasional heavy{snows  
 in winter.                            
  The vast parkland and fields hosts a 
 variety of{wildlife, plants and trees.
  Within the Hardwick estate are many  
{footpaths,}having beautifully scenic  
 surroundings both in the wooded       
 hillside and by the lake.             
  Since the population is small and    
{industrialisation}is notable by its   
 absence, the main source of{pollution 
 in the area emanates from the exhausts
 of the heavy motorway{traffic.
