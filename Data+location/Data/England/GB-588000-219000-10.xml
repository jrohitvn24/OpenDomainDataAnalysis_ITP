		<content> In our D_block most people said that a
 Bistro has opened as well as a nursery
 school which is supposed to be very   
 good. Another thing that has opened is
 a new village hall. Although these    
 three buildings are not in our        
 D_block, they have obviously          
 affected the people in the village.The
 Saxons founded Easthorpe.The Roman    
 road was an escape route from         
 Colchester. Then the Danes came and   
 renamed it Easthorpe.The prefabricated
 council houses were only supposed to  
 stay up for 10 years,but they are     
 still standing 40 years later. In     
 Easthorpe we talked to the owner of   
 Easthorpe Hall who said the houses    
 have changed in Easthorpe.Most people 
 said that there were more houses and  
 that the pub was a shop.The pub is    
 known as The House Without a Name,as  
 they couldn't think of a name for it. </content>
