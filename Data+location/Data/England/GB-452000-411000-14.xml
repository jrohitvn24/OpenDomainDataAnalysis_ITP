		<title>14The Miners' Strike</title>
		<content>   The miners' strike didn't affect our
 close families, but rather our other  
 family, Askern Swimming Club.The      
 boilers needed coal to heat the       
 water, but because of the strike we   
 didn't get any. Thus, of course, the  
 water was freezing, making swimming   
 impossible. Therefore we entered a 6  
 month swimless period. During this    
 period however, Carl and I went to the
 volleyball set-up in Campsall Village 
 Hall. These sessions were good but    
 nowhere as good as swimming. Other    
 pools, however, were still open around
 Doncaster and so we could go to       
 inter_club galas. However, because of 
 the lack of training we didn't win    
 any. Our personal best times didn't   
 improve much.                         
  When the pool reopened after 6 months
 Carl left the swimming club but I     
 stayed.                               </content>
