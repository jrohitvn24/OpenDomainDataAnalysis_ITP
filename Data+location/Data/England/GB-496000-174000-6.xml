 Mr.Oliver Everett has been the        
 librarian at Windsor Castle since     
 February 1985;he was deputy for 12    
 months before that.40% of his time    
 is spent in caring for the archives   
 in the Round Tower;less than 10% on   
 the book collection and the rest in   
 helping special researchers and       
 historians allowed access to the      
 papers.                               
{FAVOURITE BOOK *}A Dance to the Music 
 of Time by Anthony Powell (12 volumes)
{SPARE TIME ACTIVITIES *}Playing real  
 tennis, squash,racquets;gardening     
{HIS VIEW OF 1985 *}Great achievements 
 are rapid travel, space travel,       
 computers.                            
 Sad points are, little progress made  
 in combating terrorism and violence.  
 People in Africa are starving while   
 Europeans have too much of everything.</content>
