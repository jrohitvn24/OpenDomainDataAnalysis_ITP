		<title>16ST.MARY MAGDALENE'S CHURCH</title>
		<content> HISTORY.We looked up the Domesday Book
 and found that our church was built by
 the Saxons. You can still see a Saxon 
 wall and doorway and sundials carved  
 in the wall. There are medieval       
 windows and  piscina but the biggest  
 extension was when John Bolney built  
 the tower in 1536. It is 66ft. high,  
 square with four small turrets, each  
 with bands of iron to remind villagers
 of the wealden iron industry.It has a 
 Tudos-style doorway and the coats of  
 arms of John Bolnay and St. Leger. The
 South porch is 18th. Century and its  
 floor is made of old gravestones. The 
 sundial above it is dated 1850. The   
 clock on the tower was built to       
 celebrate Queen Victoria's Jubilee.   
 The Victorians added the North        
 aisle.The whole church is of local    
 sandstone and is architecturally      
 coherent and pleasing.                </content>
