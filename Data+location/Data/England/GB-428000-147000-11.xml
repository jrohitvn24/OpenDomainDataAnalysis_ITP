		<title>11        Appleshaw.</title>
		<content> A vee-shaped road separates{Appleshaw 
 from{Ragged Appleshaw. }The latter    
 consists mainly of modern{houses}built
 since 1945 and a row of average-sized 
{bungalows. }There is a large complex  
 of{council houses,}a{vicarage}and a   
 couple of{cottages. }A{playing field  
 offers a{cricket pitch}and{football   
 facilities, both regularly used by    
 local teams.                          
                                       
{Appleshaw}also has a new housing      
 development, 'West View', but apart   
 from this is relatively undeveloped.  
 Another{public house,}'The Walnut     
 Tree', a{church, post office}and food 
 store provide the focal points.  One  
 of the inhabitants described the place
 as '...a real English village...' and 
 it certainly blends in well with the  
 general atmosphere of the block
