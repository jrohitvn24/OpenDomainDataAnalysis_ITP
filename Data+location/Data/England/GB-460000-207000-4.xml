Local inhabitants are most concerned in
1985 about the possibility of motorway 
being built through the area.  This    
will be the M40 link from Waterstock to
Birmingham.                            
                                       
Finding employment in this area can be 
a problem.  People not directly        
involved with farming must go elsewhere
to find work, usually to Oxford,       
Aylesbury or High Wycombe, and many    
people commute to London.              
                                       
Property in this area is very          
expensive.  In the villages only rarely
is property available at less than     
40,000 pounds.  Thus, young people tend
to leave the area, initially for       
employment and later for accommodation.
