		<content> The working day begins about 7 o'clock
 Bacon and eggs are no longer usual for
 breakfast, except at week-ends.Workers
 drive away. The school buses leave at 
 8.30a.m. taking small children to     
 Kirkbymoorside,and others to Nawton.On
 the farms,'10 o'clocks' or'allowances'
 are mid-morning snacks. The mid-day   
 meal, now not usually the main meal , 
 is referred to,as'lunch' by all except
 the children, who still call it the   
 more traditional 'dinner-time'. Sunday
 lunch, however, is still roast meat   
 Yorkshire pudding, and vegatables. The
 evening meal, usually called 'tea',may
 be sandwiches and cakes,or a 3 course 
 meal.About 60% of people eat only trad
 -itional English food. Fish and chips 
 or convenience foods are rarely eaten.
 Cooking is done on oil, electric or   
 coal stoves. Most homes have a deep-  
 freezer. Cakes and jams are homemade. </content>
