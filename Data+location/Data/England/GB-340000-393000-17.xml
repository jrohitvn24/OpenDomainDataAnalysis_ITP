		<title>17Visiting a Safari Park</title>
		<content>    Last Sunday we went with our next  
 door neighbours by car to{Knowsley    
{Safari Park.}  It was very hot in the 
 car because we had to keep the windows
 shut.   First we went through the lion
 enclosure.   They were all loose.   A 
 notice said if lions approach or      
 attack, sound the horn and wait for a 
 white hunter.   One lion started to   
 approach.  My sister started to scream
 and my mum went from 15 to 30 mph.  We
 were luck the gates were open or we   
 would have crashed.   After all that  
 we went into the monkey enclosure.    
 There were lots of them all over the  
 car.   They were having fights on the 
 bonnet, one fell backwards onto the   
 aerial and it snapped.   After that we
 went to the picnic area to have       
 something to eat.
