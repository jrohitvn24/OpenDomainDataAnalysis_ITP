		<title>17The Village Pub(1)</title>
		<content>  My Dad,Walter Taylor ,is the landlord
of the  Walmer Bridge  Inn. The pub    
is nearly a hundred years old. It is   
open every day.The licensing hours are 
Mondays to Saturdays - 11.30a.m. to    
3.00p.m. and 5.30p.m. to 11.00p.m. and 
Sundays -12..00 until 2.00p.m. and     
7.00p.m. until 10.30p.m.               
  The pub is owned by the Greenall     
Whitley brewery. The most popular      
drink is bitter beer. We have a cellar 
to keep barrels of beer in.Altogether  
we keep about three hundred gallons of 
beer at any one time.                  
  Like most pubs these days we serve   
food as well as drink but it does not  
make as much money. We serve food      
at lunchtime from 12.00 until 2.00 but 
we don't serve any on Sunday.          
  My dad has seven part-time staff and 
the busiest time of the week is Friday 
evening.(Contd.)                       </content>
