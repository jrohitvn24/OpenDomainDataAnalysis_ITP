		<title>01The Whitchurch Area</title>
		<content> The Whitchurch area lies south of     
 Bristol.It is dominated by the eastern
 slopes of Dundry hill,which rise to   
 197 metres.This is extensively farmed 
 and provides many opportunities for   
 recreational activities.              
 The area has 3 settlements,which are  
 the villages of Queen Charlton,Norton 
 Malreward and Whitchurch.The first two
 have remained virtually undeveloped,  
 whilst Whitchurch has become a suburb 
 of Bristol,with intensive development 
 during the last 20 years,around the   
 heart of the old village.Steady       
 expansion continues,but on a smaller  
 scale.                                
 There is evidence of much earlier     
 occupation.Roman remains have been    
 found near Lyons Court farm.The       
 Wansdyke,a Saxon earthwork,can be seen
 near Maes Knoll,which is itself an    
 Iron Age Fort on Dundry.              </content>
