		<title>08WHY HONDA CHOSE SWINDON</title>
		<content>{Honda's}decision to establish a site  
 at South Marston has been front page  
 news in the Swindon local newspapers  
 and has been a major topic of         
 conversation. Some have called the    
 decision as important as that taken by
 the Great Western Railway in 1840 to  
 establish their workshops at Swindon. 
                                       
{Why was Swindon chosen?               
{1.}The car with which Honda will be   
 most concerned is the Project XX being
 developed in collaboration with       
 British car company Austin Rover.     
 Austin Rover already have a car body  
 plant at Swindon and the new car will 
 be assembled at Cowley only 40        
 kilometres from Swindon.              
{2.}The South Marston site includes the
 former Vickers airfield which offers  
 both a runway for executive aircraft  
 and an excellent car testing track.   </content>
