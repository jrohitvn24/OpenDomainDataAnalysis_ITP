		<content>    On Sunday 2nd June 1985 I got up at
 quarter past ten. Then I had my break-
 fast.                                 
   I went to church because I am in the
 church choir. At twelve o'clock we    
 came out of church and went home.     
   I did some cooking.Then I had my    
 dinner.                               
   At half past two my Mum,Dad,Grandma 
 and myself went out for the afternoon.
 We went to Widecombe on the Moor.We   
 looked round,in the shops and         
 brought little things. Then we went   
 back to the car park and had an       
 icecream each. Then we went across    
 Dartmoor and saw horses, foals, cows  
 and calves.                           
   Then we went to Badgers Holt. At    
 Dartmeet we looked at some birds and  
 walked by the river.  Then we went    
 home.
