  {Halsway Manor}lies between the      
{Brendon}and{Quantock}hills in 10 acres
 of garden and woodland. This fine     
 mansion,built of local red sandstone  
 has battlements and gargoyles and     
 resident ghosts.                      
   Although Halsway spans more than 9  
 centuries only a little of a{Tudor}   
 house can be traced  as it has been   
 much altered over the years. The      
 cellars,and the library with its dark 
 and beautifully carved panels are the 
 oldest parts. Tradition says that     
{Cardinal Beaufort}used it as a{Hunting
{Lodge.}Years later it was sold to     
 pay off a ransom to a Breton Pirate.  
   After being a farmhouse it fell into
 disrepair. The{Halsway Society}bought 
 it 21 years ago and in 1982 the       
 original stables were reunited with   
 the Manor and formed {The Mews.       </content>
