		<content> Now children still do chores and help 
 out,but they goto bed a lot later.    
   There were'nt a lot of shops in the 
 village at this time. There was a     
 spice shop (sweet shop),butchers and  
 grocers. Most shops in 1930-40 were   
 along the main road which is called   
 Marshland Road. In the grocers in     
 Moorends, a loaf of bread would have  
 cost two pence ha'penny (just under   
 one pence) now a loaf costs thirty    
 nine pence.                           
   Dutchmen came to cut the peat on the
 moors. Most people used peat for fuel.
 Then coal was discovered so the Dutch 
 workers helped to sink the first coal 
 pit. Six people were killed doing     
 this. One man slipped from the top of 
 the shaft and was killed because      
 someone stole his clogs so he had to  
 go to work in shoes. There was also   
 flooding in the pit.                  </content>
