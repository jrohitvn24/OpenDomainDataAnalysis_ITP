		<content>   It used to be called  the  Ipswich  
Sanatorium, founded as a  memorial to  
King Edward VII  and  built  in 1912.  
The original  buildings and equipment  
cost  about  16,000 Pounds,  but  the  
hospital was extended during the next  
twenty years.                          
   It was  built for people suffering  
from  tuberculosis, facing south with  
balconies, so that patients could get  
sunshine  and fresh air.  In 1948 the  
hospital  was   taken  over   by  the  
National Health Service and  became a  
home  for   Ukranians  who  had  been  
prisoners  in  the  Second World War.  
From 1960 to 1975  the hospital dealt  
with  general  chest  conditions, not  
just  tuberculosis.    In  1975   the  
hospital was closed. From April 1980,  
for about a year,  the  hospital  was  
used as a centre for  Vietnamese Boat  
People from the Far East.              </content>
