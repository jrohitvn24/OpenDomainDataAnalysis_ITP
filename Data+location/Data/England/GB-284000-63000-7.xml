		<content> At 8.45 a.m.on a Sunday morning my    
 alarm clock went off. I got out of    
 bedand went downstairs and washed.    
 Then I got dressed. The bells of the  
 churchstarted to ring at 9 o'clock,so 
 I went to church on my white rally    
 racer. When I got to church I went in 
 and changed. We wear a red cassock and
 a white cottar which is a sort of     
 short shirt. After singing in the     
 choir, I go home. I usully see my dad 
 and then my auntie turns up. When she 
 goes we have dinner. This week we had 
 roast pork, potatoes,                 
 carrots, peas, swede and gravy.       
 In the afternoon I usually go outside 
 and play on my bike.                  
 After tea I sit and watch T.V. I like 
 watching quiz shows. Sometimes I play 
 on my computer.                       
 I go to bed at 9.30 p.m.
