		<content> Busy streets and cars are jammed      
 together,but to live in Tenterden is  
 nice. I like it because there is a lot
 to do and lots of nice people. I would
 like  it more if there was a Sports   
 Centre and I think that's what's      
 missing. There are lots of shops and  
 there are some nice places to visit,  
 where you  can see some nice things.  
 In the Museum there are things about  
 the railway where some times you can  
 see some old steam engines.           
 In school today apart from having to  
 write this, we did lots of charts     
 about how people came to school. Eight
 came by car, one by bicycle, three in 
 a taxi, twelve walked and the other   
 eleven walked unless it was raining,  
 when they came by car.
