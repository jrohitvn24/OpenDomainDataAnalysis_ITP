		<content> When I first arrived in Lichfield     
seven years ago the fields behind King 
Edward VI School on the outskirts of   
the city were, well, just fields! Now  
as the years have gone by, a strange   
phenomenon has occured. A "plague" of  
modern houses has "crept" across the   
fields stretching further and further  
out from the city "gobbling up"        
anything that stands in its way.       
  The first indication one gets that   
the "plague" is about to begin is when 
large signs appear in the field bearing
the name of some "mythical god" (or    
developer!) who has "Purchased the land
for Development." Next, large monstrous
creatures appear on the scene devouring
the land - and turning it into a sea of
mud (with holes in it!). At this stage 
you have passed the point of no return,
and, as if by magic, in a few weeks    
more "Creeping Houses" will appear!    </content>
