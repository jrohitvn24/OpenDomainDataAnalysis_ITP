		<content> Most typifying Dalwood is its thriving
 community spirit. People in the       
 village work cooperatively on many    
 village projects. The local school    
 enjoys the support of the whole       
 community in fund raising,project work
 and helpers in school. The school in  
 turn is involved in village events    
 such as Fair Week, May Day            
 Celebrations and Harvest Festival.    
 There is a thriving Women's Institute,
 Parochial Church Council and Village  
 Hall Committee. A whole week of events
 is organised by the villagers during  
 Fair Week including a concert in the  
 Village Hall and a Fancy Dress Parade.
 The whole village is involved.
