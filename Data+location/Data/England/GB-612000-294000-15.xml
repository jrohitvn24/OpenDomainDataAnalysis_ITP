		<title>15TACOLNESTON VILLAGE HALL</title>
		<content> The inception of a village hall arose 
 from a public meeting called by the   
 W.I. &amp; Ladies Friendship Club.        
 3.5 acres of land were purchased, most
 of which became a recreation area, &amp;  
 finally the hall was built in 1983.   
                                       
{The cost was Â£45,000 of which Â£15,000 
 was from fundraising activities,&amp; the 
 remainder from grants from public     
 funds.Although the hall was designed &amp;
 built within a strict financial limit,
 it has proved to be adequate for most 
 of the needs of the village.It is very
 well_used &amp; financially sound.        
                                       
 The recreation area provides a cricket
 pitch,football pitch &amp; a hard court   
 for netball or tennis also a childrens
 play area.                            
 All these amenities are in            
 full use.                             </content>
