		<title>09ARABLE FARMING IN ELMBRIDGE</title>
		<content> The mainarable crops are wheat and    
 barley with a small amount of sugar   
 beet, oil seed rape and potatoes. The 
 crops are generally sold to local     
 markets, feed merchants and also      
 co-operatives. On the larger farms    
 many of the hedges and odd trees have 
 been removed to make the fields larger
 enabling the use of big machinery. The
 hedges surrounding the fields are     
 generally cut by a pulverising machine
 Many of the farms are a family concern
 Contract labour is used quite often.  
 The land is largely owned by the      
 occupiers, except a four hundred acre 
 unit which is rented from a pension   
 fund. A nursery produces container    
 grown shrubs for sale to the general  
 public and landscape gardeners. A 70  
 acre fruit farm mainly produces apples
 which are stored in a refridgeration  
 unit before they are sold.            </content>
