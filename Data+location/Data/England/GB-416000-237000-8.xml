		<title>08FARMING IN PAXFORD AREA (2)</title>
		<content> Grassland is for summer grazing,hay   
 and silage,some in large bales in     
 plastic bags.4 Friesian herds contain 
 15,90,95&amp;115 cows.Milk is collected   
 daily by tanker to a Milk Marketing   
 Board Depot where it is pasteurised   
 and bottled.Any surplus is made into  
 butter,cheese etc.Due to over         
 production the M.M.B.(who have a      
 monopoly)impose a quota system.A levy 
 is charged on excess.Other stock are  
 2 flocks of 500 &amp; 150 sheep for fat   
 lamb production and 2 herds of beef   
 cattle,either fattened on the farm or 
 sold as stores at Stratford or Banbury
 Market.There are no working horses but
 17 are kept for riding or breeding.   
 Farming is thriving in this area but  
 threats of over production may be     
 partly solved by one of the wettest   
 seasons that can be remembered.
