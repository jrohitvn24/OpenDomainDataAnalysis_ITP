		<content>  Recreational facilities in a rural   
 area are obviously very limited but a 
{Cricket Club}was formed in 1976 and   
 now has its home ground at the        
 Stocking's Field which belongs to the 
 Church at Aston Ingham. A{Tennis Club 
 was formed a few years later and now  
 has one hard court laid on the same   
 field and plans are in hand for a     
 grass court. On a separate piece of   
 land the work has started on laying a 
{Bowling Green}and it is hoped it will 
 be ready for use in 1987.             
  All these clubs draw their membership
 from a wide area which includes our   
 block. There are a few houses with    
 outdoor swimming pools. The owners are
 all very generous in allowing others  
 the use of these pools,in particular  
 the Scouts and Guides.
