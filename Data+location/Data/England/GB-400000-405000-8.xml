		<title>08MILLS IN SADDLEWORTH</title>
		<content> In this area there were several mills 
 of importance but now they exist only 
 as buildings serving other purposes.  
 The most impressive was Dobcross Loom 
 Works, which was the original site of 
 Wrigley Mill. Finished in 1861, it was
 famous for woollen and cotton looms   
 which were exported worldwide &amp; were  
 renowned for their lasting qualities. 
 These Hutchinson &amp; Hollingworth looms 
 are now superseded by Italian looms, &amp;
 the Mill was closed in 1967, to be    
 taken over by Shaws, pallet makers.   
 This is currently a thriving concern. 
 The office building with a Victorian  
 frontage &amp; fine clock are notable.    
 Wharf Mill nearby, built in 1780, was 
 originally the Cooperative Wholesale  
 Society's, but is now a group of small
 units (upholsterers &amp; sheet metal).At 
 Kiln Green was Henry Smith's, adhesive
 manufacturer, now an incubator makers.</content>
