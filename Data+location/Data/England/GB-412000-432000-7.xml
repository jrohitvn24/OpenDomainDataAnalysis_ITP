 On{Saturday May 11th 1985}at          
 aproximately 3.45pm the mainstand at  
 Valley Parade,the home of Bradford    
 City Football Club,caught fire.There  
 were almost 3000 fans in the stand,of 
 which{56 people were killed}and many  
 seriously injured.It is not known how 
 the fire started but it is thought a  
 cigarette fell into the rubbish under 
 the stand and set it alight.Once the  
 fire took hold it soon spread,in four 
 minutes the{whole stand was ablaze.}  
 Most of the dead were killed in the   
 passageway.The fans who were trapped  
 were burned.The emergency services    
 worked very hard trying to save the   
 many fans who were trapped.Many of the
 rescuers were also burned as they     
 tried to save the casualties.
