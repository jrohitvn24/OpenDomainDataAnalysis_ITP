		<content> In constrast to their neighbours the  
 villages have relatively little crime.
 This does'nt mean it is a haven of    
 purity as there are still cases of    
 petty crime,burglary being the most   
 frequent but on the whole the         
 perpetraters come from outside the    
 area.The days of the villages bobby   
 are gone and policeman are generally  
 only seen in emergency.The nearest    
 police station is several miles away  
 and the area is policed by a mobile   
 force.Vandalism is much less as there 
 are less young people to make mischief
 and also a lack of street lights in   
 the villages means a lack of movement 
 on winter nights.Although country     
 people are noted for their            
 watchfulness of strangers they are not
 very security conscious and are quite 
 trusting,making them easier targets   
 for travelling thieves.               </content>
