 In Codrington ,a small settlement just
 outside  Bristol the roads are        
 narrow.There are no pavements making  
 it very dangerous for pedestrians ,   
 especially as people who drive on     
 these roads drive fast and carelessly 
 because they do not expectto meet much
 traffic in the country.In Codrington  
 there is only one bus a week to Yate  
 on a Friday,returning an hour and a   
 half later,which is not very          
 convenient.All the villagers have cars
 and say that you must have one to live
 in the country as there are no local  
 shops and they have to go to          
 Bristol,Yate or Chipping Sodbury.Most 
 villagers think that the Motorway is  
 an advantage as they can reach Bristol
 very quickly, but some prefer to go   
 through the quiet country roads even  
 if takes longer.                      </content>
