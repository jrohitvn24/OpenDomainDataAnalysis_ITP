		<content> The former gamekeepers cottage is now 
 a UMIST field study centre.Besides    
 accommodation for a research team     
 working on nearby Great Dun Fell,there
 are weather measuring devices whose   
 readings at 200m complement those made
 on the high station.Research is into  
 cloud formation &amp; atmospheric chemist-
 ry.The information gained enables     
 scientists to study the effect of     
 pollutants in the atmosphere.Because  
 "acid rain" is now a matter of inter- 
 national concern,this is now one of a 
 network of research sites being used  
 by different groups to investigate the
 effect of gases on clouds &amp; rain.The  
 question is so complex that the work  
 has years still to go,but it is       
 encouraging that so many organisations
 take part,from the Atomic Energy      
 Authority &amp; CEGB to the Met.Office &amp;  
 Institute of Terrestrial Ecology.     </content>
