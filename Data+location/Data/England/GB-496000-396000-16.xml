		<content> Many people in the area travel out to 
{Brigg }or {Scunthorpe}if they want    
 most sports but if they want to watch 
 football they can watch {Waddingham   
{F.C.}play (even though the pitch is in
 a village nearby).Some people do      
 gardening or cut the grass.In         
 Waddingham the teenagers play football
 on the green or on a small bit of     
 grass on a public path called{"Joshua 
{Way"}.In September_October time       
 people go to a small fair that comes  
 to the green each year.At night people
 go to Waddingham pub to play          
 darts,dominoes or cards for cups and  
 trophies against other pubs.Many      
 people go to the{Village Hall}to play 
 bingo.It starts at 7.00pm and finishes
 at 9.30pm.There is also a snooker room
 which is well used.Some people in our 
 village like drawing the Church or    
 other interesting buildings.          </content>
