		<content>  Two becks run through the village,the
{Kirk and Skirden}becks.Both of these  
 join the{River Ribble.                
  There is a waterfall in Holden called
 'Scarloons'which is on the            
 Holden Beck.                          
  There is a large area of land in the 
 village called{Bolton Park.}The land  
 used to belong to Bolton Hall(which   
 was demolished),but is now mostly     
 farmland.The park still has many      
 deciduous trees and flowering shrubs. 
  There is a row of 13 trees on the    
 village green.The trees were planted  
 in 1884,and are all Horse-chestnut and
 Lime trees,except for one,which is    
 Oak.                                  
 There are several mixed woods and     
 conifer plantations in the eastern    
 part of the area.
