		<title>13Willsbridge Nature Trail.</title>
		<content>   The Avon Wildlife Trust are con-    
 verting Willsbridge Mill and Valley   
 into a Wildlife and Countryside       
 Centre. Siston Brook was dammed in    
 1730 .The first mill was an iron mill 
 and then became a corn mill, but in   
 1968 there was a flood and the dam was
 destroyed. The mill was so damaged    
 that it could not work any more.      
   The Trust have created a wildlife   
 garden, with an area for butterflies, 
 an area for bees, a wildflower meadow 
 and trees with berries to attract     
 birds. Two ponds have been created by 
 the mill to attract wildlife. The mill
 is being turned into a visitor centre 
 and classrooms are being built. The   
 valley is very quiet and beautiful.   
 The nature trail takes about an hour  
 walking slowly.
