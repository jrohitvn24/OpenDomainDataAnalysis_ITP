		<title>19Thoughts on Thurmaston.</title>
		<content>    I think Thurmaston is a good place 
 to live because the factories are in  
 three clumps and the rest is shops,   
 houses and parks. There are quite a   
 lot of shops in the village and a big 
 Superstore.                           
    There are lots of friendly people  
 and lots of places to go to like clubs
 including Judo, Squash, Cricket, Cubs,
 Scouts, Brownies and Guides.There are 
 also lots of pubs and clubs for       
 adults. I go to the British Legion    
 with my dad. It has got a games room  
 with a pool table, two dart boards and
 a table video game.                   
    It is a very safe place. On the    
 main roads, like the Bypass, there are
 foot bridges and an under pass.       
    There are definitely enough        
 facilities in Thurmaston because we   
 are only a small village.
