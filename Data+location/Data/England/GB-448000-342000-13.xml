		<title>13Traffic Survey in Nuthall</title>
		<content> A Survey of the A610 By-pass:- We went
 to the bypass at lunch time on Monday,
 Wednesday, Thursday and Friday in one 
 week. We watched the road and counted 
 the traffic. We found that Monday was 
 the busiest day and Wednesday the     
 quietest. On each day cars were seen  
 most often and lorries second most    
 often. Vans were also common. One or  
 two motor cycles were seen each day.  
 Coaches travelling South were seen on 
 Thursday, Friday and Monday. On       
 Tuesday we saw one coach going North. 
 Only two bicycles were seen, one going
 North, the other South. They were seen
 on Monday and Friday. Only one service
 bus was seen. It was going South on   
 Wednesday. There was more traffic     
 travelling North every day except on  
 Friday. Pedestrians were only seen on 
 the footbridge, never on the busy dual
 carriageway itself.                   </content>
