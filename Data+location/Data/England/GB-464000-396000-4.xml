		<title>04INDUSTRY IN FINNINGLEY</title>
		<content>       Finningley, although a{commuter 
{village}, has a small area of         
{industrial development.}But it is well
{hidden}from the main part of the      
 village and few passers-by know it    
 exists. Yet the industries are well   
{known}in the area. Leons motor        
 services operate the{bus services}into
 Doncaster whilst Biffa Waste          
 Disposal's red lorries are often seen 
 on the roads and lorry loads of       
{potatoes}head towards Higgins Potato  
 store from surrounding farms. It seems
 odd that such a{rural environment     
 should be home for these industrial   
 concerns. However the most suprising  
 "find" is R.E.Trem &amp; Co. Ltd. whose   
{engineering business}lies hemned in   
 between Leons bus garage and a        
 bungalow - who would have thought such
 a business could exist in this        
 location ?                            </content>
