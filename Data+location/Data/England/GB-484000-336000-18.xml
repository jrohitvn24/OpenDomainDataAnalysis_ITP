		<content>{King William (by J.Dixon age 10yrs)   
                                       
 King William came from Normandy,      
 And sailed across the English sea.    
 He had his eye on Harold's throne,    
 And wanted England as his own./       
 William landed at Pevensey Bay,       
 Harold went to meet him,              
 He had an army strong and bold,       
 And thought that he would beat him,/  
 King Harold's men were on a hill,     
 King Harold stood up high,            
 A Norman arrow whizzed past them,     
 And struck him in the eye./           
 King William had a Domesday book,     
 It was a great long list,             
 Of all the people in the land,        
 And nobody was missed./               
 Then William sent his nobles round,   
 To see what people owned,             
 And then he knew what tax to charge,  
 But many people moaned.               </content>
