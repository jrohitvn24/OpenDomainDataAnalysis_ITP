		<title>10EMERGENCY SERVICES</title>
		<content> We have a Fire Station with a         
 part_time brigade, 1 fire engine and 1
 fire landrover.  We have a police     
 station but this is only manned at    
 intervals.  3 men patrol the district 
 by car during each 24 hours.  They    
 work 3x8 hour shifts.  A 4th man      
 rests.  If you dialled 999 your call  
 would go to Chester.  They could send 
 a car within 3 minutes of receiving   
 the call.  The building of the M6 has 
 not affected police calls, but it has 
 affected the fire and ambulance       
 services.  The ambulance comes from   
 Sandbach.  The police answer all      
 emergency calls which are mainly      
 burglaries and traffic accidents. They
 all receive special training but only 
 traffic police drive at very high     
 speed.  They are liable to prosecution
 if they cause an accident.  All       
 casualities are taken to Leighton H.  </content>
