		<title>12Conservation And Climate</title>
		<content> An average summers day in the North   
 West of England is about 72F.We have a
 lot of rain because the clouds blown  
 in from they Atlantic sea have to rise
 to get over the Pennine mountains.As  
 the clouds rise they get colder and   
 let out the rain.Our climatic         
 conditions are ideal for growing trees
 and so we have lots of greenery.A     
 green conservation area near to us is 
 Runcorn Hill.In the 19th century      
 Runcorn Hill was a quarry then in the 
 Victorian times it was used as a      
 rubbish dump.In the early 1900's many 
 people were out of work so they       
 lanscaped Runcorn Hill and made it    
 into a recreation area.Today people   
 can use Runcorn Hill and the          
 surrounding area for a walk or        
 birdwatching.
