		<title>04THE WURLITZER ORGAN.</title>
		<content> In Beer there is a{Wurlitzer}organ.It 
 was the first{Wurlitzer}organ that    
 came from the U.S.A.The organ was     
 installed in the Congregational Chapel
 in 1925.In those days it wore a brass 
 plate that bore the words "Hope Jones 
 Unit Orchestra"which has now worn     
 away.                                 
      Each year people ask to see      
 and play the organ,a man even comes   
 from Holland just to have a go on the 
 organ.Many famous people have played  
 on it.Really the organ is very small  
 with only two manuals and a pedal-    
 board but it is still a very interes- 
 ting object for organ fanatics.
