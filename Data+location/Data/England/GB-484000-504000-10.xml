		<title>10Eskdaleside Manor; a poem.</title>
		<content>           {ESKDALEGATE                
 South-West of Sleights there lies a   
                                   road
 Where once the Lords of Manor rode    
 With greatest dignity and Pride,      
 To Manor House of Eskdaleside.        
 Built up in sixteen ninty seven       
 The house rose up like bread and      
                                leaven,
 Three storeys built with great        
                              dispatch,
 Were covered skilfully with thatch    
 For tiles were not yet on their way   
 Though later they had come to stay.   
 The Lord's Apartments,on the East,    
 Were quite cut off from man and beast,
 While on the other side,the farm,     
 Was noisy,thrang,and never calm.      
 BUT FARMS WERE REALLY BUILT FOR STOCK 
 WHILE MANORS WERE FOR ARISTOC!
