		<title>03Desford Village (Part2)</title>
		<content> Desford is a lively village owing much
 to the community college. There is    
 much social life generated by the 4   
 local pubs. It also has Scouts,       
 Cubs, Beavers, Guides, Brownies, Youth
 Club and Woodcraft for its youngsters.
 There are also events at the Miners'  
 Institute and the Church Centre (the  
 old edwardian Infants' School), whilst
 the old Board School is now owned by  
 the Scouts. The village is well served
 with shops, bank and dentists.
