		<content>   To the east of Hedge End is the much
 older village of Botley.There is a    
 busy main road through the village.   
 Around the village are fields and     
 farms.The  fields are mainly full of  
 crops with some grazing land.The crops
 are mostly strawberries.In the south  
 is the Hamble river.It runs through   
 the Hamble Country Park and Botley    
 village itself.The river used to work 
 a flour mill which is still there     
 today producing flour.Also to the     
 south is Manor farm which is now a    
 museum to show farming techniques in  
 Hampshire between 1850 and 1950.There 
 is a walk from here to the Hamble     
 Country Park which is a large area of 
 woodland beside the river.There is    
 also a stretch of roman road which is 
 now a bridleway.
