		<title>18Ash Lagoons Sutton-cum-Lound</title>
		<content> In Sutton there are two ash lagoons.  
 These have been made from old gravel  
 pits that have been deepened and the  
 sides built up.  When they have       
 finished digging they sow grass seed  
 on the banks to make them look more   
 natural.  The water inside can be up  
 to sixty feet deep.  All the ash is   
 piped from Cottam Power Station.      
 Normally it takes lO years to fill    
 them but sometimes it does not take as
 long as that.  The ash looks very     
 solid and safe but really it is very  
 dangerous and is like quick-sand.  The
 sides of the lagoons are very steep   
 and the top is flat.  When the ash    
 lagoon is full, they sprinkle soil on 
 and use it to plant things in         
 eventually.  Last year the ash froze  
 and the wind blew dust all over Sutton
 and Lound.
