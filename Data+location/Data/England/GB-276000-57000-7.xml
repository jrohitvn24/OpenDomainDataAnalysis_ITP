		<title>07Transport around Harberton</title>
		<content> Most people feel that a car is        
 essential especially those in outlying
 areas.                                
 Car ownership has lead to a decline in
 public transport services which are   
 now inadequate.Over the last ten years
 the bus service has declined from     
 several buses a day to two a week     
 (apart from the daily school buses to 
 Totnes and Harbertonford during school
 terms). A community bus service has   
 been instigated recently, and taxis   
 are used regularly by villagers as a  
 flexible alternative to public        
 transport. Many people could not live 
 in the area if they did not have acess
 to a car - some families have two     
 cars.                                 
 The nearest town Totnes is on the main
 railway line from the West Country to 
 London.
