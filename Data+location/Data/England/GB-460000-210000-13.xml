		<title>13Oakley Airstrip</title>
		<content>The Oakley airstip was constructed for 
the Second World War, it was used by   
Lancaster bombers, one of which crashed
in the Thame Road .After the war its   
use as an aerodrome ceased. It has been
used by British Leyland for the storage
of cars. Nowadays the airfied has a    
single hanger on it.This is used for   
the storage of grain for the E.E.C.    
One of the James Bond films,"Octopussy"
had scenes shot on the airstrip.       
Nowadays,the land has crops growing on 
it,and the runway is used by the       
villagers for walking their dogs,riding
bicycles,flying model aeroplanes and   
some gliding. Auctions have been held  
there. Looking towards the future, an  
application has been made for its use  
as a skidpan and driving lesson centre 
by the Police.
