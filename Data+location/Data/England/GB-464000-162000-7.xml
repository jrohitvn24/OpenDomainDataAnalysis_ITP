 Childrens accounts of talk (5-6yrs):- 
 "She told us about the house called   
 Saddlers (the oldest house in the     
 village). On one side of the house her
 Grandpa made saddles for horses, but  
 on the other side was a small sweet   
 shop and she went to get her sweets   
 there." "The school was much smaller  
 and it only had 30 children in one    
 large room - that is the amount we've 
 got in one class." "There was a       
 pumping station and a water tower and 
 two cobblers and four blacksmiths and 
 when she was a girl she painted the   
 horse's hooves with oil if it was     
 quiet." "There were two cycle shops   
 and the vicar was the first one in the
 village to have a car." "There were   
 five little sweet shops that had nice 
 sweets in them."
