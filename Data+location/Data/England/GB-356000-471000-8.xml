		<title>08Gypsy travellers in Melling.</title>
		<content>                                       
   Every June a Fair is held at Appleby
in Cumbria where, for 300 years,       
gypsies have been meeting and trading  
horses. Melling is on the gypsies'     
trade route to Appleby and at this     
time they come through the village     
regularly and stay en-route to and     
from the Fair. Some call in the        
Melling Hall Hotel for an evening      
drink and a chat. Some come from       
Bolton where,in winter,they live in    
houses. Many come in bow-topped wagons 
which are light for the horses to pull 
up hills. They tether their horses on  
the moor and stay here free of charge. 
One young gipsy stays in his tent in   
the village while his parents go on to 
the Fair. He works for local farmers,  
potato picking, siloing or odd jobbing,
to earn money. He rides bareback       
through the village on a gypsy horse.  </content>
