		<title>18CHOLWICH TOWN FARM.</title>
		<content> Cholwich Town has never been a town   
 as we might imagine with shops and    
 factories.The word town is a form of  
 the old English 'tun',meaning farm.   
 This farm has been here since 1204,   
 over 750 years,although it has been   
 added to over the centuries.Although  
 it is being encroached upon by the    
 Cholwichtown waste tip,its historical 
 importance should preserve it for the 
 future.The house has been altered over
 the centuries and has a number of     
 staircases,deep cupboards and winding 
 passages.At one time the farm did     
 belong to the Cholwich family but by  
 the 1870's all the land had been      
 dispersed,leaving only the farm name. 
 The hill under which it is situated   
 gives some protection from the cold   
 wind in winter and a spring still runs
 past the farm.At present the farm is  
 unoccupied.                           </content>
