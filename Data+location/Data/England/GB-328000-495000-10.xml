		<content>{WATER SPORTS:}Coniston Water offers   
 wonderful opportunities for many kinds
 of water sport. There is a 16kph{speed
{limit}over the whole lake, so that    
 speedboats and water-skiing are not   
 allowed. This makes the lake more     
 pleasant to use for{sailing}craft,    
 windsurfers, rowing boats and         
 swimmers. The{fishing}in the lake is  
 very good.                            
 There is a{public launching site}with 
 boatyard, cafe, carpark and toilets.  
 At Coniston Hall the{Coniston Sailing 
{Club}have their launching site and    
 club facilities, from which they run  
 frequent yacht races. The public have 
 access to much of the lake's west     
 shore, and pebbly{beaches}near to     
 fairly shallow water give good        
 opportunities for{swimming}and        
 paddling.
