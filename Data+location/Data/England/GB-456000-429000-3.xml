		<content> Mr Twigg gets up at half past six in  
 the morning.  He has cereals for      
 breakfast.  He is married and works in
 Leeds as a telephone engineer.  In    
 his spare time he enjoys gardening.   
 He goes to bed at 10.30.  His wife    
 gets up at the same time - she works  
 in Leeds as a nurse.  Mrs Twigg enjoys
 riding a horse in her spare time.     
 They do not have any children.        
                                       
 They usually have a sandwich for lunch
 and a cooked meal on an evening.  They
 have a car.                           
                                       
 They enjoy living in Thorpe Willoughby
 because it is quiet.  They have lived 
 there for 5 years.                    
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
