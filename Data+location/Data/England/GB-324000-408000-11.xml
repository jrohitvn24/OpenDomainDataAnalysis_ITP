		<title>11THE CHANGING SHAPE</title>
		<content> THIS EXPOSED STRETCH OF COASTLINE IS  
 CONSTANTLY UNDER ATTACK FROM THE WIND 
 AND SEA. CONSEQUENTLY THE SHAPE OF    
 THIS COAST HAS CHANGED MANY TIMES IN  
 THE RECENT PAST, GENERALLY GRADUAL BUT
 OFTEN DRAMATICALLY.                   
 DURING THE NINETEENTH CENTURY THERE   
 WAS ABOUT 220 METRES ADDED TO THE     
 COAST OFF FORMBY POINT. HOWEVER, SINCE
 1906 THERE HAS BEEN A LOSS OF 400     
 METRES IN PLACES.                     
 THE PLANTING OF MARRAM GRASS IS STILL 
 THE MAIN METHOD OF STOPPING EROSION,  
 ALTHOUGH BRUSHWOOD AND SYNTHETIC      
 FENCES ARE BEING PUT UP TO TRY TO     
 REGAIN SOME OF THE RECENT LOSSES. THIS
 AREA IS PART OF THE SEFTON COAST      
 MANAGEMENT SCHEME WHERE SEVERAL BODIES
 CO-OPERATE TO PRESERVE THIS IMPORTANT 
 COASTLINE.                            
                                       
                                       </content>
