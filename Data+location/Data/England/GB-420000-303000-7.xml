		<title>07 Transport in 1985.</title>
		<content>                                       
 Today's transport in Tamworth is much 
quicker than walking.                  
 {Cars} use petrol and small vans      
diesel. Ordinary cars are for          
families. Lorries are for taking loads 
and parcels to people around the       
country. Most cars are made of metal   
but Reliant use fibre glass.           
 The {Sinclair C5} is a new vehicle to 
be seen on the roads. You can pedal it 
like a bicycle near the edge of the    
road.                                  
 {Trains} are powered by electricity or
by diesel. Trains can carry you        
anywhere in the world for business     
or for pleasure. The trains are        
timetabled to  arrive and depart at    
certain times but they never seem to   
be on time. Trains are quick; they     
never get stuck in traffic jams!
