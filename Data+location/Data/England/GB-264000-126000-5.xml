 The Triumphal Arch was built in 1959  
 on a hill overlooking Castle Hill, in 
 memory of the Earl and Countess       
 Fortescue who died within days of each
 other in 1958.                        
 Hugh Fortescue founded Filleigh school
 in 1861.  It has been extended and now
 houses three classes: Infants (5 to   
 7 years old), Lower Juniors (7 to 9)  
 and Upper Juniors (9 to 11).          
 There was a major fire at Castle Hill 
 on March 10, 1934.  The house-keeper  
 and another servant lost their lives  
 in the fire, the house-keeper after   
 alerting the other occupants of the   
 house to the danger.  Fire brigades   
 from South Molton, Barnstaple,        
 Tiverton and Bideford were summoned.  
 Much valuable furniture was destroyed 
 but most of the family silver was     
 saved.                                </content>
