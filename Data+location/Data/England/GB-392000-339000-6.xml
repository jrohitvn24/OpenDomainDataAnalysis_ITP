		<title>06THE WINDMILL AT MEIR HEATH.</title>
		<content>The Windmill was recorded on Yate's    
county map of 1775 and was thought to  
have been built by R.A.Broster in      
1771.The pub by it was called The Dusty
Miller.In 1827 the mill had a kiln,    
new built house, garden and stables.In 
1939 two sails and a cap remained      
until the Home  Guards removed them and
built a watchtower for the war and that
was removed in the 1960s.Now the tower 
carries a set of radio communication   
aerials.Two of the three windows have  
been altered from rectangular to       
circular.The windmill went out of use  
after 1897 because the machinery was   
worn out.Altons Brewery of Derby bought
the mill and The Dusty Miller.         
Staffordshire Potteries Water Works    
bought the mill in 1908 and put in a   
water tank to distribute water locally 
and it stayed like this until 1928 when
Joules Brewery bought it.              </content>
