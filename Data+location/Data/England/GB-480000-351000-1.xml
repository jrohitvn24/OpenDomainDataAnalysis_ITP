		<content>{                                      
{SITUATION}The village is in East      
 Notts. being about 30 kms from        
 Lincoln and Leicester with the Fosse  
 Way, a Roman Road, linking the two    
 cities.Newark is 3 kms away in a N.W. 
 direction and Mansfield 27kms away in 
 a W.N.W. direction. Balderton is      
 easily found on the new A.1. road.    
{SITE}Balderton grew on good fertile   
 soil. There is a road called Spring   
 Lane which suggests a local source of 
 water. The village is built around St.
 Giles'Church which was built on a     
 slight rise in the centre of the      
 village.                              
{CHANGES}'Village'is not a good word to
 use when describing Balderton as it is
 almost a small town. It has grown     
 rapidly since the 1920's and houses   
 have been built  on the farmland so   
 fewer farms remain.                   </content>
