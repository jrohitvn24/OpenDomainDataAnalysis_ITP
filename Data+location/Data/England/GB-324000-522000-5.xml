		<title>05Keswicks Parks</title>
		<content> More than a century ago,the old Fitz  
 Park was made.In the early 1880's,a   
 group of men started the park which is
 situated on the bank's of the River   
 Greta.The New Park is more or less    
 for older people to play games like   
 bowls,and in summer,tennis.In the New 
 Park there is a golf course.The Old   
 Park has now got a B.M.X course.The   
 course was made a few months          
 ago.Before the B.M.X course was       
 made,there used to be sheep trials but
 they cannot be any now.The Old Park   
 has also got some swings.             
    In the summer visitors use Crow    
 Park (by Lake Derwentwater) as an area
 of enjoyment.It is known as a bathing 
 area.Last year in 1984 there was a    
 service where the churches of Keswick 
 gathered together.The service was a   
 Holy Communion.It was an Easter       
 Service so there was an Easter Play.  </content>
