		<content>{ Quatford}is easily accessible from   
 Bridgnorth. The picturesque and       
 pleasant villa residences attract the 
 attention of many tourists. Woods     
 surround the area of sandstone        
 terraces covered by rich red loamy    
 soils. There existed an old river     
 crossing at Quatford before the town  
 of Bridgnorth was established.        
   The village has a{pub,}a{nursery, a 
{garage, two restaurants, two caravan  
 sites and a{church,}which was         
 consecrated 900 years ago_at the same 
 time as the Doomesday Book was        
 compiled.                             
   Many tourists pass through, or stop 
 to admire this attractive village.    
 They provide a valuable source of     
 income for the village and are        
 tolerated by the villagers, many of   
 whom appear to have an old fashioned  
 view on life.                         </content>
