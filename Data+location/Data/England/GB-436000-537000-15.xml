		<title>15Wheatley Hill - My Village</title>
		<content>    I live in{Wheatley Hill.}It is a   
 small village in County Durham. There 
 used to be a{coal mine}in the village 
 and most of the men were{miners.}In   
 1968 the mine closed.                 
    The large pulley wheel used to     
 overshadow the village, but now it has
 gone and there are horses grazing on  
 green fields where it once stood.     
    Now there is a lot of unemployment 
 in the village. Some people have been 
 lucky enough to find work in nearby { 
{toy or clothing factories}in{Peterlee.
    There are some new businesses in   
 the village but not many new          
 buildings. Old buildings are changed  
 not pulled down. The Anorak Factory   
 was once the chapel, a large D.I.Y    
 store was a cinema, a Sportswear      
 factory was the dance hall. The old   
 secondary school is now factory units.
