		<content>There are not many Clubs in Perton     
itselcause of its relatively small     
population. There is a local Drame     
Group(Perton Players),Perton Angling   
Club,a Swimming Club(Perton  Dippers-  
which use a local pool) and so on. For 
the children of Perton a Disco is      
usually held on a Saturday at the      
Community Centre. There is a Youth Club
at the Community Centre which runs a   
number of activities for the children: 
for example; Table Tennis and Snooker. 
   I think that there should be a      
Sports Hall in Perton so you would not 
have to go to Codsall just to play     
Tennis.                                
  Visiters to Perton could visit the   
two Public Houses here, take a walk    
alon the lakeside or simply sit        
on one of the benches and feed the     
Ducks.                                 
                                       </content>
