		<content> Clerkenwell and Finsbury lie almost   
 immediately northwards of the City of 
 London.  Practically bordered by one  
 of the Thames's main tributaries, the 
 Fleet River, the area has also always 
 been famous for an abundance of good  
 quality fresh water.This is reflected 
 in place names, as Clerkenwell itself,
 and that many industries are 'water   
 based'.The locality is now mainly     
 residential, providing workers for the
 City and central London. The two main 
 Post Office HQ, and the Smithfield    
 meat market have also been traditional
 important employers. Most housing is  
 modern or modernised. A ready market  
 for labour has thus always meant waves
 of immigration.From other parts of the
 UK, central &amp; southern Europe, the    
 Mediterranean, the Carribbean and all 
 over Asia, they have come to live and 
 give their character to the district. </content>
