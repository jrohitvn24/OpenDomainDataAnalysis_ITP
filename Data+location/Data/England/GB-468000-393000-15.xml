		<title>15THE CLOTHES PEOPLE WEAR</title>
		<content> I try to wear things that are in      
 fashion,like a blouse with a tie or a 
 plain skirt with big pockets and      
 dresses with no waistband,but a       
 bigwide skirt at the bottom.Socks with
 little trimmings(pom poms) beads and  
 studs are fashionable,cotton,nylon and
 polyester are the main                
 materials.Fluorescent socks           
 (worn odd)are in fashion              
 green,pink,orange,yellow and blue.The 
 fashionable jeans are either slack or 
 tight so baggy or short zip-ups or    
 button ups are very fashionable.Jelly 
 bean sandals look nice but are slowly 
 going out of fashion(jelly bean       
 sandals are plastic)Ankle chains are  
 fashionable with boys.Big chunky      
 necalaces and bracelets with big and  
 bright coloured earings are in        
 fashion.Shoes with pointed toes are   
 slip-ons are the fashion.             </content>
