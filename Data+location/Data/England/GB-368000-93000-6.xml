		<title>06E. CHARMINSTER - RECREATION</title>
		<content>  There are no organised facilities for
 recreation within this section of the 
 parish, other than those based on     
 rural pursuits.                       
  The Riding School situated at New    
 Buildings has fourteen horses. There  
 is an enclosed training area, although
 riders also make use of the many      
 bridleways in the surrounding         
 countryside. The school also offers   
 livery facilities to horse owners.    
 They are fortunate in having the use  
 of a natural water bore hole on their 
 land.                                 
  Several small copses within the area 
 house pheasant hatcheries, and{shoots}
 in season make use of the land, which 
 also supports the South Dorset Hunt.  
  The eastern side of the parish is    
 greatly enjoyed by walkers, who make  
 full use of the network of footpaths. 
 Views are extensive in all directions.</content>
