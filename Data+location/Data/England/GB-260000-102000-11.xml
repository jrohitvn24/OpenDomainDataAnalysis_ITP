		<title>11Local History of Exbourne</title>
		<content> We can trace Exbournes' Saxon origins 
 in the names of some of the farms,eg. 
 Court Barton,East Barton.Add to these 
 the acreage of Town Living and Home   
 Living Farms and the total is 436     
 acres,the original Domesday acreage;  
 valued at half a virgate with 2 plough
 teams and 13 slaves.The original      
 ten Villein farms have been identified
 and still exist today. They are       
 Coxwell,Waterhouse,Woodhall,Shilston, 
 Swanstone,Buskin,Yardown,Narracott,   
 Chattafin and Hole.In 1800 Town       
 Living was still divided between 10   
 occupiers in a Strip field system.It  
 is now one farm.                      
 Farm boundaries have tended to remain 
 unchanged as this is an area of small 
 yeoman farmers and squires not Country
 estates.The cottages have been built  
 to house farm workers and their needs 
 around the central farms and Church.  </content>
