		<content>     There is little full time         
 employment in the area. Although some 
 farms are still worked most are owned 
 by commuters who leave the land or    
 work it as a small holding. Bed and   
 breakfast and standing for caravans   
 are available. All the inns provide   
 bed and breakfast, meals and snacks.  
 Milltown-Clay Cross Iron and Foundries
 Co. did mine fluorspar. Now the site  
 is used for a floatation plant where  
 fluorspar and barytes from elsewhere, 
 including parts of Derbyshire, are    
 brought in and processed. The minerals
 are then sold to other companies. Only
 a few people are employed at this     
 plant. Some lead mines are still      
 uncapped but no longer mined. There is
 a small complex comprising of a       
 joinery, a building contrator and two 
 subsidiaries. There are two garages. A
 local council tip employs one man.    </content>
