		<content> A chalk quarry on the eastern edge of 
 the block is in Anstey parish.Owned   
 and worked by Pertwee Landforce,it    
 covers 16 acres and has been in       
 production since 1914.Originally the  
 chalk was dug by hand and carted by   
 horses.Later a large steam engine was 
 installed.Since 1945 all is dug and   
 moved by tractor.Today it produces    
 up to 20,000 tonnes of chalk per      
 year.This is used for agricultural    
 chalk and is delivered over about 300 
 square miles.                         
  Flints are also quarried.These are   
 used for knapping,mainly for  the     
 repair of old churches and other      
 buildings.Originally there were glass 
 works that used flint in Hare Street 3
 miles south,but these no longer       
 exist.The quarry employs 5            
 people.Flint Cottages on the edge of  
 the block were built from this Quarry.</content>
