		<content>  Following the drainage of the land   
 around Newport at the end of the      
 1780's,the farming changed from       
 pastural to arable. The soil is mainly
 a heavy clay with small areas of      
 lighter silt soil.The main crops grown
 are barley and wheat.There are also   
 several grass fields,that have proved 
 too wet to cultivate cereals.On these 
 grass fields,cattle and sheep are     
 reared.                               
  A new development to have emerged in 
 the last few years is the amount of   
 land in the area being used for market
 gardening.Many hectares are now       
 growing lettuce, celery, carrots,     
 tomatoes and other vegetables. There  
 is a daily collection of produce by   
 large lorries for distribution to a   
 large chain of super markets.
