		<title>07Housing in Rawdon</title>
		<content>  There is a wide variety of housing in
 the Rawdon district.A few old halls   
 and mansions,some dating from the     
 first Elizabethan era,are still used  
 as private homes,and there are many   
 old Yorkshire-stone cottages.Those in 
 Little London have been extensively   
 renovated,and this is now a           
 conservation area.                    
  Gradual expansion of housing has     
 taken place this century,including    
 small estates of both private and     
 council houses,and developments of    
 sheltered accommodation for the       
 elderly.Most property is privately    
 owned,and a wide range is available,  
 varying in price from about Â£20 000   
 to over Â£100 000.                     
  The present population of Rawdon     
 village is approximately 6 580,and    
 there are no plans for any major      
 developments within the next 10 years.</content>
