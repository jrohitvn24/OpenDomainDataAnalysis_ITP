		<title>13FARMING IN FACCOMBE</title>
		<content> All agricultural and grazing land in  
 Faccombe is owned by Faccombe Estates 
 Ltd. The soil is varied with pockets  
 of chalk. There are 24 acres of       
 permanent pasture and 205 acres of    
 ploughed fields which have a 6m strip 
 around the edge which is never        
 fertilised or sprayed. This enables   
 the ground to produce its natural crop
 alongside the sown crop. Poppies,     
 cowslips, orchids, snowdrops,         
 daffodils, and primroses abound, with 
 butterflies including the small blue. 
 3000 fattening lambs and 2500 ewes are
 kept.In 1985 the grass was plentiful  
 but too wet and consequently of poor  
 quality, the animals did not fatten,  
 needing extra feeding. Grain yield was
 average but high rainfall accompanied 
 by mainly low temperatures and strong 
 winds resulted in the grain starting  
 to grow and be of very poor quality.  </content>
