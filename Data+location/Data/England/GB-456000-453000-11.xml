		<title>11Fashion for Women &amp; Girls</title>
		<content>  In 1985 young girls and teenagers    
 would probably wear fashion clothes   
 from department and chain stores and  
 boutiques. Cotton skirts and blouses  
 are popular in pastel colours and     
 primary colours and especially in     
 white during the summer. Denim jeans  
 are still popular. Teenagers like     
 wearing three quarter length trousers 
 plain brightly coloured tops and white
 cotton jackets. The creased look is   
 fashionable and clothes are loose     
 fitting. Older women tend to wear     
 clothes that stay fashionable longer. 
 Most women have a shirtwaister which  
 is a dress with a shirt top with long 
 or short sleeves,and a full or        
 straight skirt. Most ladies like to   
 wear separates, which are blouses or  
 jumpers with straight or gathered     
 skirts with hems just below the knee.
