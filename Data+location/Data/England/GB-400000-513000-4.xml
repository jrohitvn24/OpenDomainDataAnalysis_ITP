		<title>04Dialect</title>
		<content>  As in all other parts of the country 
 this area has its own dialect which is
 fully understood only by those native 
 to the place,and even they might have 
 difficulty in grasping the meaning of 
 some of the farmers' conversations.   
  Among other things,less printable    
 than the following,you will hear "gey"
 used for "very" and "yon" for "that". 
 The old words "thee" and "thou" tend  
 to be used often."Ewe" is pronounced  
 as "yow" and "pasture" as "passter".A 
 local boy will leave his friends to   
 "gan yam" rather than "go home".      
  A farmer who has cows to take to the 
 local auction has "beast t' tek t't   
 mart".Another expression is "Seesther"
 which means "Seest thou?" or "Look at 
 that".A freer translation for this all
 -purpose phrase would be "xxxxx!" When
 poultry is prepared for market it is  
 plucked.In this area it is "ploated". </content>
