		<title>16Girl Guides in S.on A.</title>
		<content> Clubs. The Girl Guide movement was    
 started by Lady Baden-Powell in 1910. 
 It has been growing ever since and now
 has spread all over the world.This    
 year,1985,is the 75th Aniversary.To   
 mark the occasion each Guide and      
 Brownie Pack has done 75 "Good Turns",
 for example "Make 75 new friends" or  
 "Clean 75 windows".As another         
 celebration a candle was lit by the   
 Queen Mother and the flame passed     
 around Britain to every Pack.At first 
 the candle was given to the County    
 Commissioners,they passed the flame   
 to the District Commissioners who in  
 turn gave it to the Guide Leaders.Our 
 Leader went to Alcester to collect our
 Light.The 1st Shottery and Bishopton  
 Guides celebrated by having a party.At
 the party we all had little candles   
 which we lit from the big candle.The  
 candle was blue with seven trefoils.  </content>
