		<content> The block is an undulating area to the
 east of the industrial town of Barrow 
 -in-Furness.The bulk of the block is  
 good quality pasture land with smaller
 areas of enclosed rough grazing and   
 wet lands.Much of the area is drained 
 by deep drainage ditches which with   
 the help of small streams(becks)      
 drains the land to the sea on the     
 east.The area is lightly populated    
 with four small settlements:Leece,    
 Gleaston,Dendron and Newbiggin,and    
 isolated farm houses.The local stone, 
 carboniferous limestone,and the rocks 
 from the sea form the building        
 materials of the old houses.There is  
 an attractive coastline facing        
 Morecambe Bay whish in summer attracts
 day visitors from Barrow.The block has
 very little in the way of amenities or
 entertainment and people look to      
 Barrow for this.                      </content>
