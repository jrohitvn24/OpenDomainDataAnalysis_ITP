		<title>14Police Headquarters (2)</title>
		<content> The Headquarters controls the whole of
 North Yorkshire.The County is divided 
 into four                             
 divisions,Richmond,Harrogate,York and 
 Malton.                               
 We saw the recording studio and were  
 filmed asking questions.At first we   
 couldn't think of anything to say.It  
 was very hot because of the studio    
 lights and we felt shy.We saw         
 ourselves on film and also saw film   
 about the North Yorkshire Police and  
 their work.                           
 There is a Fingerprint Department and 
 a Photographic Studio but most of the 
 rooms are used as offices.The police  
 use a lot of computers,these cut out  
 paperwork.When a policeman sees       
 something wrong,he radios to the man  
 on the computer and he puts the       
 information on the computer.
