 within the grid area is {FARMING.     
 However, it employs comparatively few.
 The majority of farms are operated by 
 one man and his family. Casual        
 labour,especially women,is hired for  
 seasonal work.Other industries in the 
 area:    { Commercial stationery}     
  {Road haulage       Garage services  
{  Market gardening   Egg producers    
{  Plant hire         Caravan storage  
{  Potato merchant    Welding          
{  Builders           Light engineering
{  Pottery            Electrical contr.
{  Plumbers           Tile manufacture 
 These are the larger businesses in the
 area, although some are run from the  
 'operators' own home.There are a      
 number of one man firms not shown.An  
 example is the fact that 2 large road 
 hauliers operate from Coates, together
 with dozens of one man owner/operators</content>
