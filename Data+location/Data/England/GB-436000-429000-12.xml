		<content>   We have plenty of small shops in    
 Swillington. Here is a list of them:- 
{Two General Stores, One Pet Shop, Two 
{Mini Markets, Three Newsagents, Three 
{Hairdressers, Two Grocers, One Off-   
{licence, One Nusery, One Chemist, Two 
{Electrical Shops, One Butchers Shop,  
{One Lawnderette, One Fish and Chip    
{Shop, One Post Office and Two Garages.
 We have to go to nearby larger        
 villages to find a supermarket.       
                                       
   One of the most popular shops is the
 Spar because it opens longer hours and
 the owner is very friendly. They often
 have special offers. Because it is    
 near to school the Spar is like a tuck
 shop to the children. We have to go to
{Leeds, Wakefield}or other nearby towns
 to buy clothes, shoes, furniture, etc.
