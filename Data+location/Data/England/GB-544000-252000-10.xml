		<title>10Views on Great Shelford</title>
		<content>  One man we interviewed was over 65.  
 He used a car for transport. Several  
 young people as well as some older    
 people were interviewed, some used a  
 car while others used a bike.         
                                       
  They all did some kind of sport and  
 were very enthusiastic. Most of them  
 travelled into Cambridge for their    
 shopping as there was lots of choice. 
                                       
  The land is flat except for the      
 occasional hill. It is good           
 agricultural land around Great        
 Shelford and the types of farming are 
 very interesting. Many fields         
 are brilliant yellow (Rape), and      
 later on golden ripe corn covers      
 them.                                 
                                       
   There is plenty of open space for   
 recreation and other such activities. </content>
