		<title>06EDUCATION:WOODTON AREA</title>
		<content> There are 4 County Primary schools in 
 reach of children living here,Brooke, 
 Woodton,Seething &amp; Ditchingham.The    
 majority attend one of these.Woodton  
 school was founded in 1877,&amp; although 
 it is still housed in the original    
 building _ plus a mobile classroom _  
 it is light &amp; spacious &amp; its 2.2      
 teachers provide a wide education for 
 its 56 5_11-year-olds ranging from    
 computers to cookery,music &amp; pottery.A
 major step forward is the building of 
 indoor lavatories etc. to replace out-
 door facilities,which were doubtless a
 great advance in their day.Parent-    
 teacher association fund-raising &amp;    
 voluntary labour have made this       
 possible.For further education child- 
 ren attend secondary schools in       
 Norfolk,at Norwich,Framingham Earl or 
 Loddon,or over the border in Bungay,  
 to which schools they are bussed.     </content>
