		<content> rented quite cheaply are now renovated
 and put on the market at high prices. 
 This together with the expense of     
 travelling to and from their form of  
 work means only those with a high     
 income can afford to live in the      
 country.This means the village is more
 and more becoming the residence of    
 professional people and not           
 of the farm worker and the tradesman. 
 There is less interest in the church  
 these days particularly amongst young 
 people and though financial support   
 for this is good,the time residents   
 are willing to give to the running of 
 activities.This is less than it used  
 to be.Attitudes to country pursuits   
 like field sports is varied but in    
 general the view against them is      
 hardening with a new generation of    
 village dwellers.
