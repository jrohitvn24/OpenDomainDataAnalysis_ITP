		<content> In Woolmer Green there are 5 shops and
 3 pubs.There is a very old,large sign 
 painted on the side of the Post       
 Office.It says{"W.GATES LATE PEDDAR'S 
{STORES GROCERIES,PROVISIONS,HARDWARE  
{etc,CIGARETTES,TOBACCO AND SWEETS AT  
{MARKET PRICES"}.                      
 The shops are used by the local people
 although most shopping is done in     
 supermarkets in Stevenage.            
 In the Oaklands area, which is 1 km   
 southwards along the B197, there is a 
 parade of 6 shops,1 garage and a      
 pub.A fish and chip shop has only     
 recently been opened.The pub is called
 the North Star and is situated beside 
 the old Great North Road.             
 The main garage in our area was built 
 in 1900.Its name is now Lisles. They  
 are agents for Bedford,Opal and       
 Vauxhall.The other 2 petrol stations  
 are also owned by the same company.   </content>
