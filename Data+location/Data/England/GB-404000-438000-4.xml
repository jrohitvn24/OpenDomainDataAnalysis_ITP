		<content>   There are many schools in the       
 area for the{education}of younger     
 children.  These are First Schools,   
 for five to nine year olds.   Children
 in Keighley then transfer to Middle   
 Schools.  They stay at their Middle   
 School until they are 13 years old,   
 and then go on to an Upper School.    
 They can stay at an Upper School until
 they are 18 years old.  There is a    
 centre for the handicapped of all     
 ages.

 population in two purpose built homes,
 and some bungalows with a warden      
 service.  Here the occupants can be   
 independent, and yet have help at hand
 in an emergency.
