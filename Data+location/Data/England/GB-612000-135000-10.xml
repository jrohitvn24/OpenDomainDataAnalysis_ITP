  Saltwood Primary School.1985.        
                                       
 It's Monday morning and I wake up at  
 about half past seven.My sister is in 
 the bathroom and I have to wait.When I
 have finished I get dressed in my     
 school uniform and go down for        
 breakfast.It's about 8.o'clock and I  
 usually have a cup of tea and maybe   
 some cereal. I usually see my teacher 
 driving into the school.I wait at the 
 door of the classroom until the       
 whistle goes at 8.55.When we go in we 
 have Maths.At 10.10. we have Assembly 
 and then play(10.30-10.50).           
           As it's Monday we have P.E. 
 in the hall until lunch time at 12.   
 o'clock.After lunch we can play on the
 field until 1.15.when lessons start   
 again.                                
                                       </content>
