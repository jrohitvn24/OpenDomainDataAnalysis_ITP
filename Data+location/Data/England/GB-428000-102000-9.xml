		<content> William Rufus was the second son of   
 William the Conquerer.He was known as 
 William Rufus because he had red      
 hair.William Rufus became king in     
 1087.He was not a very good king      
 because he made bad laws and went     
 hunting a lot.He was out hunting in   
 the New Forest one day,when an arrow  
 struck him and he was killed straight 
 away.People think he was killed by Sir
 Walter Tyrell,but do not know if it   
 was murder or an accident.There is a  
 legend his body was taken to          
 Winchester on a cart by a man called  
 Purkis.A stone was set up in the New  
 Forest where he died and is known     
 today as the Rufus Stone. The Rufus   
 Stone is a popular tourist attraction 
 nowadays.
