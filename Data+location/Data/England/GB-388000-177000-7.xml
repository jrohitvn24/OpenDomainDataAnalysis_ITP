 him. We asked Mr Plummer some         
 questions.                            
 In the fields there is oil seed rape  
 and it is used for vegetable oil. Mr  
 Plummer has 500{cows,}and he grows

 He said "Cow cake." Mr Plummer's      
 biggest field is 250 acres. Mr        
 Plummer's tractors have cabs. Mr
