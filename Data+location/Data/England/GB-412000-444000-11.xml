 all its necessaries whilst Diane was  
 in the way, (she got an eye full of   
 cow dung.) On each side we had to get 
 six cows and get them ready for       
 milking. Once we had finished         
 milking the cows we had to swill out  
 the two sides where they had been     
 milked, for about two hours, maybe    
 more, (milking starts at 4.00pm and   
 finishes between 6.00 and 7.00pm.) At 
 about 5.30pm{Mrs. Chapman}brought us  
 some tea, a bun and a biscuit. They   
 were soon finished, we were very      
 hungry. At exactly 6.55pm we started  
 for home, by having a lift, from{     
{Mr.Chapman}in his bright yellow Rover.
 I enjoyed my day greatly and would not
 mind spending another day with a      
 farmer.
