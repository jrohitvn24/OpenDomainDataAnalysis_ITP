		<title>05BENWELL NATURE PARK</title>
		<content> In the mid 1970's terraces of{Tyneside
{flats}were demolished because they    
 were old and unsuitable for living in.
 Tyneside flats were built for two     
 families and had a front door and a   
 backdoor. The council could not build 
 new houses on the site because it was 
 on a very steep slope and there were  
 old mine workings in the area.        
  A member of the council visited      
 London to look at the{William Curtis} 
 Ecolgical Park. He came back to       
 Newcastle and persuaded the council to
 set up a{nature park}in Benwell.In    
 1982 the work began with tractors and 
 excavators reshaping the land and     
 creating a large  pond in the centre  
 of the site.Children came from all    
 over Newcastle to plant trees and     
 shrubs.The pond has attracted         
 tadpoles, frogs and newts.
