		<content> A DAY IN MY FAMILY'S LIFE             
 My name is Emma Howard.               
 On Sunday, May 31st., the family got  
 up between 6.30 and 8.30am. We all had
 cereals for breakfast.                
                                       
 My dad went up to his work at New Farm
 and my mum did a little washing and   
 dusting. My brothers and I played     
 cricket until 10.30 when I went to a  
 Brownie Service at Welsh Frankton when
 I read a prayer.                      
                                       
 My family then went to Lake Vyrnwy by 
 car. It was a beautiful day and a     
 beautiful view. I saw a tower on our  
 walk of about 1km. along the road.    
 We arrived home at 7.3opm. but then we
 went to 'The Trotting Mare' for tea.  
 I went to bed at 8.30pm. My brothers  
 and my parents went between 10.30 and 
 11.30pm. after watching television.   </content>
