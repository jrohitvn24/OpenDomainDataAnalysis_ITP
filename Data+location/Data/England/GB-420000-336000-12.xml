		<title>12THE VET</title>
		<content>    My dad is a vet.He works at        
 Kedleston, Mickleover and Duffield    
 surgery. Sometimes he gets called out 
 in the night, 3 or 4 times a week     
 - far too many! The nicest thing in a 
 vet's life is bringing new animals    
 into the world, (puppies, kittens,    
 etc). The worst thing is putting      
 animals to sleep, especially if they  
 belong to old people and the animals  
 are their only friends.               
    The strangest thing which ever     
 happened to my dad was when he had to 
 inject penicillin into an elephant    
 from the circus.                      
    When dad is on duty (that means he 
 works in the morning, noon or         
 at night) he works in the office, in  
 villages, in the country or in some   
 towns.                                
    When dad is not too busy, my       
 brother and I go with him.            </content>
