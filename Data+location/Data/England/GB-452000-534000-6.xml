		<title>06The Maritime Museum</title>
		<content>{The Headland-H/pool By Alan Watt      
 There is a Maritime Museum on the top 
 floor of Northgate Library.We went to 
 visit the Museum,which was opened in  
 1971.In the entrance hall there is a  
 mosaic floor showing the H/pool coat  
 of arms.There are old paintings on the
 walls as you go upstairs.One of the   
 paintings is of the time when the     
 Germans shelled H/pool{(Bombardment).}
 Inside the Museum there are cases full
 of things about the sea.There is an   
 old cottage with  a hole-in-the-wall  
 bed and an old-fashioned fire place.  
 There is a big old document from the  
 shipyard of William Gray showing the  
 names of the first 1000 ships which   
 they built when Hartlepool was a      
 ship-building town.The date on the    
 wall outside the library is 1903-1904.
