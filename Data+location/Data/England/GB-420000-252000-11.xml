		<content>    Stratford on Avon is a very popular
 town for tourists mainly because of   
 the Shakespeare connections.          
 Shakespeare was born in Stratford and 
 is buried at Holy Trinity church which
 stands on the banks of the River Avon.
 There is much for the tourist to see. 
 The Royal Shakespeare Theatre and     
 museum, the Shakespeare centre ,Nash's
 house and the World of Shakespeare.   
 Stratford is also a picturesque Tudor 
 town in its own right and the         
 beautiful River Avon winds its way    
 through the town.A survey we conducted
 showed that over a half of the        
 tourists we interviewed (from a sample
 of 32 )were day trippers.Over three   
 quarters of tourists were in the 20_40
 yrs age bracket and they had come from
 a variety of destinations;a half were 
 from U.S.A.and one fifth from         
 continental countries.                </content>
