 restored by the Norman Lord of the    
 Manor.Nearby is a moat where the monks
 used to catch their fish.It is on     
 private land,but ask to see it because
 it is interesting.If you walk down{   
{ABBOTS MORTON'S} only road you will   
 see the milk churn steps,used a long  
 time ago to put milk churns on.At the 
 other end of the village is the Post  
 Office and if you go there you may    
 hear about the post mistress' cat and 
 how he saved her from some robbers.If 
 you carry on you will come to a pig   
 farm.There are no shops in{ABBOTS     
{MORTON}only the Post Office which     
 sells sweets.If you do visit{ABBOTS
