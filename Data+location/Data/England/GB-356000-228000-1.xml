		<content> This is a very quiet and remote part  
 of Herefordshire.   There is one      
 village, King's Caple, a few farms,   
 and a lot of countryside.  The people 
 in King's Caple were very friendly and
 helpful, and the ones we met were most
 interested in their community and knew
 everyone else.   They seem to know    
 their neighbours and their            
 neighbourhood much better than town   
 people do.   There are some lovely old
 houses, and everyone seems to care    
 about their surroundings.   They do   
 not want them changed, and they care  
 about the countryside.   There are    
 some large farms and a man who trains 
 gun-dogs.   The River Wye winds       
 through the area and it is very good  
 for fishing and canoeing.   Like other
 parts of the county, people sell      
 things like Christmas trees and eggs  
 and vegetables from their homes.      </content>
