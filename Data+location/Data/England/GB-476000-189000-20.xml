		<content> The Church of England school at       
Frieth built as a one room school in   
1865, later in the 19th. century two   
further rooms added, all flint faced.  
 The outside Victorian toilet block    
demolished 1985 to make room for a     
toilet and cloakroom block.            
 A temporary double classroom block    
was added in 1973.                     
 The catchment area is contiguous with 
the area reviewed, the Turville area   
having been transfered in 1984 on the  
closure of its School.                 
 It caters for children 5-12 yrs. old.
