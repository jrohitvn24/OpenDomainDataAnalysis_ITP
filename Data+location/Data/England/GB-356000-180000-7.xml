		<title>07Hobbies in Patchway</title>
		<content>   I have two hobbies.  One of them is 
 computer programming.  The language I 
 use is{BASIC}which means Beginners All
 Purpose Symbolic Instruction Code.    
 There are other languages such as{    
{PILOT FORTH}and{MACHINE CODE}.        
   My other hobby is vintage motoring. 
 I am a junior member of the{Bristol   
{Austin 7 Club}.  An Austin 7 is a     
 motorcar built in the vintage period  
 1920-1935.                            
   I keep Koi carp.  They are a breed  
 of Japanese and German carp. They feed
 out of your hand.  They can live to be
 two hundred years old and grow up to  
 be four foot long. Their colours vary.
 I have fourteen of them.  Some people 
 think they're all slimy, but I stroke 
 them all the time and they feel very  
 fragile.  I have entered some of my   
 fish in shows and have got a second   
 and a third placing.                  </content>
