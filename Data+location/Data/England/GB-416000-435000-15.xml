		<title>15School Trip,Bradford(cont.)</title>
		<content>   Suddenly it was dinnertime.I was    
 hungry and hot,so I sat under a tree  
 and ate my dinner.Afterwards I went   
 to the toilet and the present shop,but
 I didn't buy anything because I went  
 to the toilet first and forgot about  
 the gift shop.After that we played    
 some more and then it was time to come
 home.I was sleepy on the coach and    
 wanted to go to sleep but Ben kept    
 tickling me and moving about.When we  
 got back to school it was home time so
 I went up to my Grandma's and told her
 all about the trip.I hadn't told her  
 where I was going because I thought   
 she already knew so I sat down last   
 night and told her.I really liked my  
 trip.                                 
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
