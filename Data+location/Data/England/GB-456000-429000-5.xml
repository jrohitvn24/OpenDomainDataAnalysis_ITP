		<content> 285 children attend {Thorpe Willoughby
{Primary School.}The pupils are aged   
 between 5 and ll.  The school is used 
 by people living in the village for   
 such activities as evening classes and
 clubs.                                
                                       
 There are 11 full-time teachers and 1 
 part-time teacher.  There is a School 
 Library but this is not housed in a   
 separate room.  Many fund-raising     
 events are held to bring in money for 
 school equipment.                     
                                       
 Many outings are organised by the     
 School but they no longer have visits 
 to the Swimming Baths like they used  
 to.  Sports matches against other     
 schools are played.  There are        
 football, cricket, netball and        
 rounders teams.
