		<title>11MARKET RASEN RACE COURSE</title>
		<content> During the first half of the 19th.    
 century the Brocklesby,Burton and     
 S.Wold Hunts held Point to Point races
 on various sites in the area. Racing  
 continued in this form until 1924,    
 when the present course was           
 constructed just to the east of the   
 town alongside the Louth road. The    
 site was used by the army during the  
 2nd. world war and in 1946 there was a
 crowd of over 22,000 to enjoy the re- 
 opening of this very picturesque      
 course. Further improvements ,        
 including a fine grandstand built     
 in 1967, have been added and large    
 crowds regularly attend the N.H.      
 meetings held through the season(about
 15 per year). It is the only          
 race-course in Lincs. and is possibly 
 has the finest setting in the country.
 The grandstand and facilities are also
 used for parties,gatherings, etc.     </content>
