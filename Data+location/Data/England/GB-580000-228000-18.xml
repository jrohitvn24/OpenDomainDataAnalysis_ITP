		<content> My house is eight hundred years old.  
 It is privately owned. It is detached.
 My house is made from large wooden    
 beams, which you can see, filled in   
 with laths and plaster made of mud    
 and horse hair. It is quite big. We   
 have three bedrooms. In the sitting   
 room the fire place is very big and   
 you can sit inside it close to the    
 fire. We have a big garden with a     
 caravan in it. Our house is {haunted. 
{I}know this because I have seen the { 
{ghost.}The house used to be two old   
 cottages until about 35 years ago when
 they changed it and made it into one  
 house. A vicar used to own the house  
 and he had a tunnel dug leading up to 
 St.Andrew's church. It is under the   
 sitting room floor. Our house is the  
 oldest in Halstead and the oldest     
 cottage in Essex.
