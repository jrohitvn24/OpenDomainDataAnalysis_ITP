 very good ambulance service, and they 
 are very quick and efficient.{        
{HOME LIFE                             
    Most people get up by 7 a.m. and   
 have finished breakfast by 8 a.m.  in 
 order to get to school or work at 9   
 a.m. Lunch is mainly eaten between 12 
 a.m. and 2 p.m.  The majority have a  
 snack, but some make it their main    
 meal. Tea is served at any time       
 between 5 p.m. and 8 p.m.  depending  
 on what time the family gets home     
 according to their activities so some 
 families do not eat together.  Supper 
 is just a cup of cocoa or coffee and a
 biscuit.  Supper is not so popular    
 these days.
