		<content>   This year{Shaftesbury Boys' Club}is 
 celebrating its hundredth anniversary.
 It is open from 6-15pm on Monday to   
 Friday. When you first join it is 50p 
 and then every time you come a further
 10p.                                  
   Inside the club, there are a gym and
 rooms for games, television, art and  
 computer. Outside, the club has a     
 five-a-side court, two grass football 
 pitches and a cricket pitch.          
   Shaftesbury organises football teams
 in six different age groups from nine 
 to eighteen, and enters the Wallasey  
 Cup, Wirral League Cup and the        
 Knockout Cup. They play matches on    
 Sundays. At Easter the under twelves  
 football team went to Belgium to play 
 matches. They stayed with Belgian     
 families.                             
   On Fridays they have judo. Sometimes
 the boys go camping to Wales.         </content>
