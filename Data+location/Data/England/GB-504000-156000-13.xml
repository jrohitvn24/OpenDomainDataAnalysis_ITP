		<content> Most houses in the area are privately 
 owned, with some rented or tied estate
 cottages. Some older houses are large 
 but with much infilling in gardens:   
 others have been replaced by 'closes' 
 of small properties. Many smaller old 
 houses and cottages have been         
 gentrified. All have mains water and  
 electricity, some gas; a few still    
 have septic tanks. Good communications
 and a situation midway between        
 Heathrow &amp; Gatwick have caused a big  
 middle class influx &amp; hence inflated  
 prices. Houses range from Tudor to mod
 -ern, all well maintained  and most of
 a pleasing traditional type. Ripley   
 has a high proportion of listed build-
 ings. Pyrford contains a permanent    
 caravan site of 100 units, which may  
 be enlarged. There is a shortage of   
 low price houses for first-time       
 buyers and the elderly.               </content>
