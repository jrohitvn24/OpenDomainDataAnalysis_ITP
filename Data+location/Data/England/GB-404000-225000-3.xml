		<content> There are two cottages opposite Lynes 
 Barn Farm.  Both are rented to young  
 couples by the farmer.  They only     
 moved in a few weeks before our       
 survey.                               
 One man is a free-lance gardener who  
 is hoping to develope the garden to be
 more or less self sufficient. He keeps
 fancy hens and and eventually hopes to
 keep goats.  He has planted some      
 vegetables in the garden.             
 The couple in the other cottage are   
 also keen on living in a remote rural 
 area although they both work in       
 Cheltenham.  They have a dog and two  
 cats.                                 
 There is electricity but no gas in the
 cottages.  They have spring water so  
 pay no water rates.                   
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
