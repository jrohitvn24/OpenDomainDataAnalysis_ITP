		<content>    On 27th June 1985 we went to Chaves
 Dairy. There we met Mr. Tadman who is 
 the milkman in charge. Chaves Dairy   
 started running about 10 years ago    
 in 1975. Mr Tadman has been there for 
 8 years. He likes his job. He is the  
 boss. He organises the rounds and     
 orders the things they need.          
     Chaves is a little cottage with a 
 big step leading up to the side door. 
     The Dairy has three big           
 refrigerated rooms where the milk     
 is stored. It is kept at 40 degrees   
 fahrenheit.                           
    The milkmen are all busy. The work 
 is hard. They work from 3am until     
 2.30pm. There are nine milk floats.   
    They sell mostly Channel Island    
 milk; silver top and some gold top    
 which is very creamy. Blue top is semi
 skimmed and red top which is sterilzed
 They also sell all types of creams.   </content>
