		<content>{Terraced houses: }These were built    
 from the 1830's onwards to house the  
 mill workers.  Some of these houses   
 are still owned by the mill           
 authorities and although fairly small,
 they are very well maintained.        
 Many of them back straight on to the  
 valley sides and as a result have     
 exceedingly long and steep gardens.   
 The names of these terraces are Long  
 Row, Albert Terrace, Victoria Terrace,
 and The Holme.   These are stone      
 built.                                
{                                      
{Semi detatched houses: }There is an   
 estate of local authority built semi  
 detatched houses in Calder Vale.  They
 are of typical 1930's design of brick 
 and pebble dash. They are situated on 
 the flatter land above the village and
 known as Burnside.
