		<title>13The Village School, Wytham</title>
		<content>   None of the 19 children living in   
 the village now go to school there.   
 There is a school and a school house, 
 but no school teachers Both of the    
 buildings are private houses.         
   When it closed in July 1968, there  
 were 13 pupils in the school.         
 Generally parents were in favour of   
 the change,though one mother said, "A 
 village is great for the younger      
 children and preferable to the crowded
 Botley schools". It cost the Berkshire
 Education Authority Â£2,400 to run the 
 school; there would be a saving after 
 meeting the cost of transport for each
 pupil to the school two miles away.   
   It was reported that the village was
 "running under strength". The farms   
 needed less labour, the cottages      
 couldn't be sold on the open market,  
 there were fewer young families and so
 the school was no longer viable.      </content>
