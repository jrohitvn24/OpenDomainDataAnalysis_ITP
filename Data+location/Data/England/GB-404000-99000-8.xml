 one of the firms is{Keith Spicer Tea  
{and Coffee Ltd.}My Grandpa started    
 the company 50 years ago. My Dad      
 joined 23 years ago and is Deputy     
 Managing Director. He often has to    
 drive a long way to see important     
 customers. Through the main door is   
 the reception desk. The offices are   
 upstairs. The laboratory, where the   
 tea and coffee are tasted, is at the  
 end of the corridor.                  
 My Dad sometimes tastes the tea and   
 coffee as a check. The main part of   
 the factory is where they roast the   
 green coffee beans, grind and pack    
 them. They import tea (in chests) and 
 make it into tea bags with machines;  
 24 million a week. You have to wear a 
 white overall in the factory. There   
 is a staff of about l00 in the        
 offices.                              </content>
