		<title>03POOLE KEYNES - BUILDINGS</title>
		<content>  In{Poole Keynes}there are a few old  
 buildings including my house. It has  
 been in our family for over 200 years 
 and my dad has kept up the farming    
 tradition. It was built over 600 years
 ago. It is built of{Cotswold}stone and
 has a big round chimney. There is a   
 big room in the house which was used  
 as a coach house or a ballroom.       
  Another old building is the church   
 which is next door to us. The church  
 was built in 1467. It is called "St.  
 Michael and All Angels". It does not  
 have a spire, just a tower like a     
 castle. Occasionally, the Sunday      
 School meets there. The church isn't  
 very big but you can hear the bell a  
 long way away. The only other         
 buildings of interest are the old     
 vicarage and the Queen Victoria       
 Memorial.
