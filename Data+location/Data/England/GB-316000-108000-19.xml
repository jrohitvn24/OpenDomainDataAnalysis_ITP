		<content> Town dwellers usually have a romantic 
 picture of country life.  Reality can 
 be rather different.                  
 Isolation is a problem for many people
 living in rural communities.  It means
 that children playing with friends has
 to be an arranged event.              
 A surprising fact is the high incid-  
 ence of depression and suicide, part- 
 icularly among farmers and their      
 wives.  The farmer is under constant  
 stress, worrying about the weather,   
 plus often pressure from the bank.    
 His wife has to cook and wash-up sev- 
 eral times a day when he comes in from
 the fields.  Usually she has to help  
 on the farm as well.  In days gone by 
 she would have farm servants, who also
 provided companionship.  The continual
 grind and the isolation, especially if
 she cannot drive, can lead to depress-
 ion.                                  </content>
