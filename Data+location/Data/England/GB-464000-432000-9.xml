		<title>09South Duffield - transport</title>
		<content>      Some of the parents in South     
 Duffield are threatening to keep      
 their children away from school       
 because the County Council will not   
 provide{free school transport.}When   
 the school closed the East Riding     
 county Council promised to provide    
 free transport to the school at       
 Hemingbrough.                         
      Now North Yorkshire County       
 Council says that as the distance is  
 less than two miles the children are  
 not entitled to free transport and    
 will have to pay.                     
      Parents say they cannot afford to
 pay, and the route the children, aged 
 between 4 and 10, have to walk is very
 dangerous. There is a deep dyke along 
 part of the road, and children have to
 cross an unmanned railway crossing,   
 and the busy A63 road.
