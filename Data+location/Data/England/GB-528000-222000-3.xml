		<title>03ST.PETER'S CHURCH, BENINGTON</title>
		<content>(Part 1)                               
In Saxon times a church probably stood 
on the same site as that now occupied  
by the present Church.As in those times
the Church still stands prominent in   
Village Life and Character.            
On entering by the 14th century PORCH  
through an ancient door, we see an     
impressive KNAVE. The arches are 14th  
century and supported on interesting   
carved corbels probably depicting local
characters of that period.The FONT bowl
is made of Barnack Stone and it is int-
eresting to speculate that babies are  
still being babtised regularly in the  
same font as their ancestors over 600  
years before.It is dated about 1350 and
the base about a century later. (Cont.)
