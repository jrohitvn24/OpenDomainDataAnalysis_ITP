		<content>{Steel production}has been carried on  
 the{Derwent Howe}site workington      
 since 19th century .In{1974}the       
 Bessamar method of producing steel was
 stopped .In{1981}the{steel works      
 closed with the loss of over{300  jobs
 the coke ovens ,pig casting           
 machines,and the huge sintar plant    
 which lime and coke together were all 
 scrapped.This left a large area of    
 land at Workington.The old Ironworks  
 buildings are used for displays.A slag
 bank 220 feet high is now being       
 dismantled.BSC were interested in     
 creating new jobs,so the{Moss Bay     
{Enterprise Trust (Mobet)}was set up to
 encourage hi-tech firms to come to    
 Workington.
