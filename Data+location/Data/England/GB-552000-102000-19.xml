		<title>19Drusillas Wine Centre</title>
		<content> Drusillas Wine Centre is famous in the
 south of England for its fine English 
 wines. Some of the wine is produced at
 the English Wine Centre,but the       
 majority is produced elsewhere in     
 Sussex. The quantity of the wine is   
 less favoured than the quality.       
                                       
 There is a small demonstration        
 vineyard at the Wine Centre. In one   
 barn there is old equipment that was  
 used to make wine &amp; cider,dating from 
 the 1700's. The main building is the  
 Walton Oak Barn which dates from      
 1770. Traditional English Gourmet     
 dinners take place at the Wine Centre 
 and this occurs in the thatched barn  
 when the numbers are large. Wine      
 tasting is another great attraction.  
 Each year there is a wine festival and
 a wine run to France.
