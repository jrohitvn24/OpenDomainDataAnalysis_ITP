		<title>16FARMING AROUND MIDHURST</title>
		<content> All farms but 1 are tenanted from the 
 Cowdray Estate.Most are 28O-3OO acres,
 mainly arable,worked with modern      
 machinery and chemical aids.Farm      
 buildings have not usually been       
 modernised and many are over 1OO years
 old.Most farms have a dairy unit for a
 secondary income.Loves farm is typical
 of local farms.It is a 3OO acre unit  
 and lets some rough grazing to a      
 neighbour's beef stock.Water is drawn 
 from the mains and the river which    
 flows through the farm.A serious      
 problem is erosion of the sandy soil. 
 When it rains the soil is carried down
 through the village street about a    
 mile away.                            
     The Water Authority has some local
 problems caused by cattle straying    
 into the river and with pollution of  
 the water when silage effluent is     
 allowed to drain into the river.      </content>
