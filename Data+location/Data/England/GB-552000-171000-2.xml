		<content> Despite its rural appearance, this    
area is very busy and traffic flow is  
one of the main points to note.        
 The A.2 Trunk road disects the area   
and is often congested at peak periods 
as commuters travel to London in the   
morning and return in the evening. In  
addition to this road are many smaller 
roads taking traffic into Dartford,    
Bexley, Crayford and Swanley, nearby   
settlements.                           
 The M.25 joins the A.2 near to Hawley 
and links through to the Dartford      
Tunnel. Extensive road works are being 
carried out at the tunnel end and      
Swanley end of this section which      
affects the traffic flow considerably. 
 As well as private cars and caravans  
a great number of commercial vehicles, 
vans, lorries, articulated and         
container traffic pass through the area
on route to Dover and the Continent.   </content>
