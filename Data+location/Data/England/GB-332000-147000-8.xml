		<content>   ON THE EASTERN OUTSKIRTS OF         
HIGHBRIDGE,THIS INDUSTRIAL ESTATE WAS  
PURCHASED BY THE NOW EXTINCT LOCAL     
COUNCIL IT THE EARLY 1950'S WHEN IT WAS
NO LONGER NEEDED AS A RAILWAY          
MARSHALLING YARD.                      
   ROADS WERE BUILT,SERVICES WERE      
PROVIDED AND LAND WAS MADE AVAILABLE   
FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF LIGHT INDUSTRY  
TO PROVIDE EMPLOYMENT FOR LOCAL PEOPLE 
NO LONGER NEEDED IN THE DECLINING      
RAILWAY AND FOOD PROCESSING            
ESTABLISHMENTS.                        
   TODAY SOME FORTY EMPLOYERS ARE      
WORKING ON THE SITE AND ALTHOUGH       
CHARGES ARE CONTINUOUS,ITS FUTURE      
APPEARS TO BE SECURE.                  
   THE CHIEF PROBLEM IS THAT OF HAVING 
A POUR ROAD BY THEM.HEAVY LORRIES STILL
TRUNDLE THROUGH THE TOWN TO THE        
INDUSTRIAL SITE.AN ALTERNATIVE ROUTE   
HAS BEEN PROVIDED BUT IS NOT POPULAR.  </content>
