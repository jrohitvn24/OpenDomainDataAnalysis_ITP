		<title>11Favourite Food at Woodthorpe</title>
		<content> If the children in our school had     
 to choose their Favourite meal, it    
 would be:                             
{First Course:                         
  Soup (Tomato, Oxtail, Chicken)       
{Main Course:                          
  Fish Fingers, Roast Beef, Beefburgers
  or Corned Beef.                      
  Chips (Nearly everyone loves chips!) 
  Peas, Baked Beans or Sweetcorn (all  
  from a tin!) or carrots (fresh)      
{Sweet:                                
  Lemon meringue pie or treacle pudding
  and custard.                         
 When it came to{drinks}most people    
 wanted some kind of fizzy drink.Most  
 preferred shandy (a little beer and a 
 lot of lemonade).                     
    Children are not allowed to drink  
{alcoholic drinks,}and most of those   
 who had tried them did not like them  
 very much.                            </content>
