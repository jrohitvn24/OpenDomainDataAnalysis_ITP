		<title>17Ladybird Kennels</title>
		<content>    Mrs.Stallard has only just taken   
 over the Ladybird Kennels, but was    
 able to give us some information about
 the business. Boarding kennels have to
 be licensed by the Local Authority and
 a vet. makes an inspection twice a    
 year.                                 
    The kennels are on about 1.8 acres 
 of land and are licensed for 50 dogs  
 and 30 cats. Each dog has its own     
 kennel and run and is exercised four  
 times a day, but the cats stay in     
 their chalets. The charges are Â£2.90 +
 V.A.T. per night for dogs and Â£1.95 + 
 V.A.T. per night for cats. Business is
 seasonal, with their busy times being 
 in the Summer and at Christmas when   
 people take their holidays.           
    Mrs.Stallard breeds and shows Great
 Danes. One of them is called Garth and
 he has to put up with a playful kitten
 called Kit.                           </content>
