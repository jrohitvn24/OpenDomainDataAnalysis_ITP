There are also Sheep Farms in the      
Bagnall area and the sheep are kept for
their wool and their meat.             
   The sheep are sheared once a        
year.Many years ago the sheep were     
sheared with clippers,now the farmers  
have installed electic shears .        
   Twice a year the sheep are dipped.It
is now the job of the police to ensure 
that the sheep are dipped properly.When
the sheep are due for a dipping the    
farmers contact the police to make sure
that they will be present when they dip
their sheep.                           
   When the sheep are dipped they are  
put in pens and then in turn they are  
pushed into a large troth like bath    
containing disinfectant.Here their body
is held under the water for around 3   
minutes to ensure that all diseases    
have been neutralized.                 </content>
