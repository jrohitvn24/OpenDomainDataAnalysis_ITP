		<content> The most significant feature of the   
 area is the part that it plays in the 
 transport network. The river Kennet   
 had been extensively used in medieval 
 and earlier times; the Kennet and Avon
 canal was of importance for 50 years  
 until the coming of the Great Western 
 Railway in the 1840's. Since the      
 1840's most of the area has been owned
 and farmed by the Benyon family of    
 Englefield House. They bought the land
 at auction from the bankrupt owner of 
 Ufton Court. The maroon coloured doors
 used by the Englefield Estate are to  
 be seen on almost all of the 19th     
 century buildings in the area,        
 demonstrating the extent of the       
 Englefield Estate's holdings even     
 today. So few medieval records appear 
 to survive for this area that it is   
 impossible to reconstruct the medieval
 environment.                          </content>
