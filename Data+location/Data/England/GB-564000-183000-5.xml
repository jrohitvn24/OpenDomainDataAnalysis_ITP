 My Dad said "these shelves need       
 filling up" and he asked me to help.  
 We started in the Off Licence first   
 because it was opening at 7 p.m. that 
 night.  I stocked up the sweets and my
 Dad stocked up the beers and spirits. 
 We had everthing the customers wanted.
  We started to work in the from of the
 shop where we sell newspapers, sweets,
 groceries and cigarettes.  We went    
 straight to bed because we had to get 
 up at 5.30 a.m. for the papers.  The 5
 paper boys arrive early and wait      
 outside until we open at 6 a.m.  We   
 close at 9 p.m.  My Dad is going to   
 change the times.  We now have the    
 front shop open from 6 a.m. until 6   
 p.m.  The Off Licence is open until   
 7.30 p.m. until 9 p.m. j
