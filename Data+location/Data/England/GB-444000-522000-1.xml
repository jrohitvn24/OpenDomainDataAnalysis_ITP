		<content> This area contrasts the old with the  
 new. There are two old villages,      
 Norton and Billingham, and many new   
 developments.                         
 Norton especially still looks like a  
 small village with a church           
 overlooking a village green complete  
 with duck pond. Contrasting this is   
 the new town centre of Billingham with
 modern buildings and The Forum, a     
 large sports centre.                  
 Most of the area has been developed.  
 There is a large industrial concern,  
 ICI, and only a few small farms and a 
 golf course.                          
 Running through the area is the A19, a
 major north - south road link serving 
 the needs of the area.                
 This is an area of contrast - the old 
 and the new - the industrial and the  
 rural.
