		<title>18A TYPICAL SATURDAY</title>
		<content>    On Saturday at 7 o'clock my alarm  
 clock wakes me. I wake my two brothers
 and have a cup of tea made by the tea-
 maker. I get milk from the refrigera- 
 tor. Then I get dressed, go downstairs
 and take out a bowl and spoon from the
 dish-washer. I get Shreddies(a cereal)
 from the cupboard. I put two pieces of
 bread in the toaster.                 
    After breakfast we go and feed the 
 ducks and chickens. Then we collect   
 the eggs. Afterwards we watch televis-
 ion on one of four channels. I go out-
 side and ride my bike which is a BMX. 
    At about 1 o'clock we have dinner  
 consisting of chicken, peas, carrots, 
 potatoes and cabbage. We have damsons 
 and cream for dessert.                
    After dinner we watch a film on the
 video. Then we garden. We eat bread   
 and jam and cake for tea. Then we     
 watch television and go to bed.       </content>
