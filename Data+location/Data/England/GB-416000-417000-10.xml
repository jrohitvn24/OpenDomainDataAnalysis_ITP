		<title>10RAWTHORPE AND KIRKHEATON</title>
		<content> The Rawthorpe area begins at the top  
 of a "{scar}"and occupies the downward
 slope of the dip.Densely populated it 
 includes two council estates built    
 since 1931 and some private           
 housing.The developers have included  
 many grassy verges and trees.Local    
 history is rather obscure and some    
 people prefer{to identify with Dalton.
 The church was built in a modern style
 during the last 20 years and many     
 local people made donations towards   
 the cost.Rawthorpe High School,Junior 
 School and Infant School have been    
 built on the same campus to serve the 
 area.In contrast,{Kirkheaton}retains  
 its village atmosphere with the church
 being a central feature.Private       
 housing development has taken place   
 but{pleasant countryside surrounds the
{area.}Jarmain's,ICI and T.W.Broadbent 
 are the major firms.                  </content>
