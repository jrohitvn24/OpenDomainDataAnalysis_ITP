 Several farms have flourishing hop    
 fields, which are protected from      
 strong winds by high hedges.   The    
 permanent poles are strung in spring &amp;
 the vines climb clockwise.            
 They are harvested mechanically in    
 late September &amp; taken by trailer to  
 the hop kilns.   Here the hops are    
 automatically separated from the      
 stalks &amp; leaves &amp; spread over canvas  
 in the kiln for some hours at a       
 controlled temperature to dry over a  
 furnace.   They are then spread out to
 cool before being compressed &amp; packed 
 into "hop pockets".                   
 Hops are susceptible to a disease     
 called Verticillium Wilt which occurs 
 in this area.   Precautionary "Keep   
 Out" notices protect most hop fields.
