		<title>07Life in a Beverley pub</title>
		<content> Our pub is called the'{Mariners arms'.
 Living in a pub is very awkward       
 because I have to lock all the doors  
 after me. We have to pay for every    
 drink that we have.  I cannot ever go 
 in the pub or the bottle store when it
 is opening time.  I help my Dad bottle
 up, that means I have to put bottles  
 on the shelves.                       
      Upstairs there is a lot of space,
 the pub is over 100 years old.  Our   
 living room used to be a dance hall,so
 it is very big.  It has a bar at one  
 end and a stage at the other.         
      We need to have trained guard    
 dogs in case of burglary.  I am nine  
 years old,when I grow up I would like 
 a pub of my own.
