		<content>  My name is David Ponsonby. I am 11   
 years old.I get up at quarter to 8 and
 dress. Then I go downstairs and have  
 some breakfast.At 1/4 to 9 I set off  
 for school.                           
  School starts at 9 o'clock and we    
 have an assembly.At about 9.30am I go 
 to the classroom and read for twenty  
 minutes, then I do maths.At 10.30a.m. 
 the school has a break.It lasts 20    
 minutes,and then we go in and do      
 English Language.At 12 noon I go for  
 dinner; I take my own sandwiches.We   
 then have playtime until 1.20pm. In   
 first part of the afternoon we do art 
 and things like that,and after a short
 break we do project work.At 3.50pm we 
 say a prayer and then I go home.When I
 get home I watch television and have  
 my tea.After tea I go out and play    
 cricket and football.I come in at     
 8.o'clock and go to bed at 10.00pm.   </content>
