		<content>   A local place of interest is the    
 Waltham Windmill.Visitors to the area 
 are able to see how the Waltham       
 Windmill Trust Society have tried to  
 restore the mill to working order.The 
 Society hold Open Days when the public
  are able to  watch the mill being    
 worked by Mr.Wilson,the miller.       
   They have maintained the four sets  
 of stones,two Derbyshire grit stones  
 which grind oats and cattle feed,and  
 the two French Burr stones which grind
 the flour.The mill can now be worked  
 by wind and engine power.             
    The Trust Society has spent over   
 thirty thousand pounds since 1979.The 
 money has been spent on painting and  
 tarring the mill.By late August or    
 early September of this year four     
 sails will have been replaced which   
 will restore it to the original six   
 sailed mill.                          </content>
