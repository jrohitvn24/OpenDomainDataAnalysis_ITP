{lived at Moat Hall Farm for 30 years.}
  (contd. from p. 14)                  
  The farm is down a chase but the     
 house has long since gone. There were 
 two cottages belonging to it beside   
 the road. They were pulled down about 
 15 years ago.                         
  Further along on the double bend     
 three cottages used to stand. They    
 were partly pulled down, and a large  
 house built on the site, which is     
 there now called Old Robins. Beside   
 Moat Hall Farm there is a bridle path 
 which goes through onto the           
 Finchingfield road at the other end of
 the village
