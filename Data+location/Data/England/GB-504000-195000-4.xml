		<content> During construction of the{M25}local  
 residents suffered from dust and      
 excessive noise. In{February 1976}the 
{Maple Cross}to{Hunton Bridge}Section  
{was opened and}in{January 1985}a      
 further section was opened linking    
 this to the{M40 at Denham.}The road is
 built in a{cutting}at one section but 
 this seems to{increase}noise to       
 surrounding houses. Some people along 
 the route sold their houses at{reduced
{prices}to escape the{increased        
{noise.At  Parkfield,}a new housing    
 development next to the{M25,}houses   
 sold quickly but some were reduced by 
{Â£1,000}because of the noise.The       
 builders sandwiched{polystyrene       
 between two fences to deaden the      
 sound.In a survey{45%}of adults       
 questioned moved to this area because 
 of good access to motorways.{62%}use  
 the M25{regularly.                    </content>
