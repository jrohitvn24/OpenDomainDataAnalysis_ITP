		<content> These are some of the memories that   
 the grandmother of one of our children
 told us.                              
 I lived in a lane which was very quiet
 with fields all round ,but now it is a
 large housing-estate.There was a dairy
 nearby and I used to collect two or   
 three pennywoth of milk in a jug. Our 
 house had four rooms and it was one of
 a group of six.Our lavatory was at the
 end of the garden and we shared it    
 with our neighbour.There was only one 
 water tap for the six houses and we   
 had to collect it in buckets. I didn't
 have any regular pocket money,because 
 my father was often ill and my mother 
 had to work very hard. We were quite  
 happy to play in the fields  and have 
 picnics. I didn't have many toys- a   
 doll of course and my brother once    
 made me a doll's pram from orange     
 boxes painted bright green.           </content>
