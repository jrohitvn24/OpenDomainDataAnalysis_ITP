		<title>16OLDER PEOPLE IN LONGSTANTON</title>
		<content>  About 120 Longstanton residents      
 are{pensioners.}Many have lived here a
 long while, but a few have arrived    
 only since retirement.                
  There are certain{problems}for old   
 people here. Suitable houses are      
 scarce, and expensive. Without a car, 
 shopping facilities are limited, and  
 the local shops are dearer than the   
 supermarkets. The nearest doctor is at
 Willingham; and those attending       
 morning surgery have no return bus    
 till afternoon.                       
  An active{Over-60s group meets on    
 alternate Thursday afternoons.        
 Sometimes there are visiting speakers,
 sometimes outings. An average         
 attendance is 35.                     
  There are 18{Old People's flats,     
 Warden-controlled and run by the      
 County Council, and 6 more are to be  
 built. There is a long waiting list.  </content>
