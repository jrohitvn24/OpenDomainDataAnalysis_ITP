		<title>18St. Mary's Church, Bridport.</title>
		<content>      Bridport's  Parish Church of St. 
 Mary in South Street is one of a Team 
 Ministry embracing six churches. The  
 rector is the Rev. Canon Edward       
 Montague Youens, Rural Dean of Lyme   
 Bay. There are three services every   
 Sunday: Holy Communion at 8 a.m.,     
 Parish or Family Communion at 9.30 a.m
 and Evensong at 6.30 p.m. Sometimes   
 there is Choral Matins or a Civic     
 Service at 11.a.m. There is also Holy 
 Communion on Tuesdays at 10.30 a.m.   
      The Church was extensively       
 restored and enlarged in 1860. Whilst 
 most of the nave and the handsome     
 three-storey embattled tower date from
 the Perpendicular period of the       
 fifteenth century, in the transepts   
 are some early English arches and     
 lancet windows going back a further   
 two centuries.                        
                                       </content>
