		<content> Emborough Pond is situated off the    
 main Bath to Wells road.  It is a     
 quiet, picturesque, picnic and fishing
 spot, set in a valley with beech      
 woods on either side and marsh land at
 the rear.  There has recently been a  
 number of platforms build around the  
 edge of the pond, used for coarse     
 fishing.Day permits are issued from   
 the local bailiff or from a pet shop  
 in Wells.  The pond attracts a variety
 of wildfowl including ducks, moorhens 
 and coots.  It has been known or swans
 to nest there.  It also has a         
 stone-built boat house with housing   
 for one small craft.  A local school  
 uses the pond for canoeing.  In the   
 winter of 1985 the pond for froze over
 and people were seen iceskating and   
 walking on it.
