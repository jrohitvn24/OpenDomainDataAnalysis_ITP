		<title>17LAMPLUGH SENIOR CITIZENS</title>
		<content> There are 96 Senior Citizens in       
 Lamplugh parish, 39 men and 57 women. 
 The oldest person is 95 years old. You
 have to be over 60 to join. When you  
 are over 60 you automatically join.   
 Out of all the Senior Citizens only 9 
 work. People who want to can go on a  
 trip or to the Christmas party if they
 like. In 1984 about 50 people went to 
 the Christmas party in the Women's    
 Institute. The Senior Citizens was    
 started by the Reverand Goddard and   
 people gave donations to start their  
 funds. Now they raise their money from
 Bingos, Stalls and Raffles. The Senior
 Citizens have been going since 1973.  
 This year there is a committee of 16.
