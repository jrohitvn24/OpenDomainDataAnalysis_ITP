		<title>17Cricket Tournament - Sussex</title>
		<content>   It had been raining for the past two
 days but the village pitch was fit to 
 play on.I (Neil) watched the days     
 play.In the first round Hartfield     
 played Ashurst and won by 9 wks.In the
 other matches Ashurst Wood beat       
 Fordcombe and Cowden beat Groombridge.
 Hammerwood just beat Colemans Hatch.In
 the first semi-final Hartfield put    
 Ashurst Wood in to bat and had to     
 chase 53 runs.Hartfield got there with
 2 overs to spare.In the other match   
 Cowden made 72 ,Hammerwood couldn't   
 get the runs.In the final Hartfield   
 scored 86 without losing a wicket.    
 Cowden started well but collapsed and 
 Hartfield won for the first time since
 1980.                                 
   The following Wednesday Hartfield   
 played against Sussex in a benefit    
 game .All the stars played.Hartfield  
 just lost by 10 runs.We all enjoyed it</content>
