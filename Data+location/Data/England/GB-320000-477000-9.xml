		<title>09A STREET INTERVIEW</title>
		<content>     A group of the researchers        
 interviewed an old gentleman whilst   
 doing field work in Askam. Asked about
 his opinion of the life in the        
 district he replied with enthusiasm:  
 "It suits me fine. I have my          
 allotment,I keep poultry,I keep       
 pigeons,I love wild life,particularly 
 birds,although there have been certain
 changes in the area which has altered 
 the pattern of wild life visitors.For 
 instance,some derelict areas have     
 introduced pollution of the           
 environment and as a consequence some 
 wild life no longer visits the scene, 
 particularly in the housing areas."   
    Asked if he was satisfied with the 
 services available in the district he 
 replied: "Yes, I do not seem to       
 require more than at present." A      
 contented man, in fact!               
                                       </content>
