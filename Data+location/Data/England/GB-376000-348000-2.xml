		<title>02BATESWOOD OPEN CAST MINE</title>
		<content>The open cast mine near our school     
takes up a large area of land.It has   
been here for about 6 years and will be
mined for about another 4 years.It     
employs about 60 men working from 7am  
in the morning to 7pm at night.Often   
the men work overtime.                 
The mine is allowed to bore down to 75 
metres and we have had permission to   
visit the site to see the work.        
Years ago the land was all grassland   
and trees with a footpath across it to 
Scot Hay.Today the trees and grass and 
wildlife have gone and we cannot walk  
along the path because huge Caterpillar
trucks are moving the soil,rocks and   
coal.When I went they showed me the    
machinery and trucks - one of them     
could hold 50 tonnes of rocks or coal.
