		<title>08LAND OWNERSHIP</title>
		<content>    Most of the land in the Stambridge 
 area is owned by {Rankins Farms}.The  
 land is used mainly for arable crops  
 but there is also a large poultry farm
 in the area. This comprises of several
 buildings spread around the area. The 
 sheds behind Stambridge Church produce
 large numbers of fertilised chicken   
 eggs. These are then transferred to   
 an incubation house behind the Cherry 
 Tree Public House.After hatching they 
 are then sent to rearing stations.    
 Eventually they are killed for the    
 table.This is a regular cycle of      
 production.                           
    The area produces a wide range of  
 crops including potatoes,rape         
 seed,peas,wheat and numerous other    
 cereals.
