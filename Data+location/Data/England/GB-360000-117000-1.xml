		<content> This area of land is all in{Dorset}but
 close to the Somerset border.It is    
 quite{hilly}although not very high,the
 highest point is 162m above sea level.
 The hill tops join with one another   
 along a line from North East to South 
 West.They are connected by farm       
 tracks. Nearly all of the area is     
{farmland},the steep slopes are mostly 
 rough grazing and the rest either     
 arable or grassland. There are a      
 number of very{small villages}        
 surrounding the block, but none in    
 it. The only place in the block to    
 have shops and several houses is in   
 the south-east corner which contains  
 the historic town of{Sherborne.}There 
 are some fairly{small woodlands;}and a
 number of small{streams.}The streams  
 all join the{River Yeo}just outside   
 our block.                            
                                       </content>
