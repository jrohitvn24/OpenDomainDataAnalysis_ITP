		<content> The{M11}motorway runs north-south     
 across this area. Further south it    
 intersects with the{M25}London orbital
 motorway. A fortunate effect of the   
 opening of these two roads            
 (particularly the latter) has been a  
 considerable decrease in heavy goods  
 traffic in the North Weald area. It   
 has, incidentally, resulted in the    
 closure of the only transport cafe in 
 North Weald.                          
   The presence of the M11 has probably
 been a blessing inasmuch as it forms a
 barrier to the further spread of      
 Harlow New Town in this direction,    
 saving North Weald from being         
 swallowed up in urban expansion, a    
 fate which has befallen a number of   
 other villages in the Harlow area.
