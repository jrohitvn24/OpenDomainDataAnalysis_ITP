		<title>01ST.MARGARET'S BAY.</title>
		<content>  {ST.MARGARET'S BAY }is a part of the 
 village of {ST.MARGARET'S-AT-CLIFFE,  
 which is about 4 miles from {DOVER.}  
 There are about 2000 people in the    
 village and most of them commute to   
 nearby towns to work.                 
   It is divided into two parts-{THE   
{BAY}and {THE VILLAGE.}The village     
 contains houses and shops while the   
 Bay consists mainly of houses.        
   We are quite lucky to have enough   
 shops for us to manage to live well   
 without having to go into Dover-baker,
 grocer,greengrocer,chemist,newsagent, 
 butcher and a post office as well as 6
 pubs!                                 
   The name of the village come from   
 the name given to the church-{ST.     
{MARGARET'S  OF ANTIOCH }and its only  
 claim to fame in the past has been    
 when the bay was used as a landing    
 beach for cross Channel swims.        </content>
