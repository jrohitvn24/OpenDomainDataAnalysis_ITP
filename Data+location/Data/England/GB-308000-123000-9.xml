		<title>09BATHEALTON</title>
		<content> The landscape round Bathealton is very
 beautiful country land.It has lots of 
 different types of wildlife e.g.      
 badger,deer and many others.There are 
 different woods and lanes which have  
 a lot of history behind them.Stone    
 Hill Lane winds up for three miles    
 through a copse,it has a well just to 
 the right and in 1959 it is believed  
 that an old woman who lived up in the 
 copse was pushed down the well or she 
 could have thrown herself in ,no one  
 will ever know.The coomn land is      
 traditionally land that anybody can   
 put their animals on to graze.But the 
 land around Bathealton for about one  
 and a half miles is very marshy and   
 not very good for animals.The land is 
 very nice to look at and you get a    
 lovely view on a clear day.
