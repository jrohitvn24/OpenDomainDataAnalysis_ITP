When we looked at how people got to    
school we found that 83 people in the  
first year travelled by bus, 12 people 
travelled by car, 1 person by taxi, a  
few people cycled and nobody walked. If
we had asked the whole school we would 
expect the same results. Had we done   
the survey in a town school we would   
expect most pupils to walk or cycle.   </content>
