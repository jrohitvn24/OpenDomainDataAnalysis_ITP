		<content>I get out of bed at 7.45 each morning. 
Then I have my breakfast which is      
usually toast, cereals and a cup of    
tea. After breakfast I get ready and   
set for school. I catch the No 50      
Whitegate bus. My fare is 13p.(half    
fare). As I get off the bus I go to the
corner shop to buy a packet of crisps  
or some sweets. Then I go to school    
which starts at 8.55. We assemble in   
the hall after registration for hymns  
and prayers. Then we go to class for   
Maths. At 10.30 we have playtime. I    
play Tig, a game of chasing with the   
other boys and girls. Playtime finishes
at 10.45. We do English until 12.00,   
dinner time when I have a main meal and
a dessert. In the afternoon we have    
General Studies until 3.40, home time. 
When I get home I watch TV until tea.  
After tea I play out until 8.30. Then I
have supper and go to bed.             </content>
