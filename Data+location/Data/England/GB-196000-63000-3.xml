 wheel but are small{Sherpas.}The vans 
 are both diesel. Mr Martyn uses his   
 buses to collect and deliver children 
 to and from school safely.            
  The{Milk lorry}can not go faster than
 40 m.p.h.It is 6 tons when empty, but 
 when it is full it weighs 16 tons .It 
 is 19 feet or so long.It holds 2000   
 gallons.

 of machinery.They are versatile and   
 are used for many jobs.Farmers may    
 have a number of tractors each being  
 suited for heavy or light work.
