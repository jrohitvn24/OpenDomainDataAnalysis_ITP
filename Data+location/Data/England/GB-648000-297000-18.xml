There are quite a few different things 
in the village. There is a school, the 
Ripplecraft Boat Company, a few farms, 
a public house, a manor house and a    
Lord and Lady Somerleyton. There is a  
man, Mr. Thacker, who has a collection 
of old tractors that he is selling. My 
dad bought one. Then, of course, there 
is my parent's business. They own and  
work in a petrol station and an oil    
business.                              
The Post Office must be quite old for  
it has lattice windows. Outside is a   
post box and a telephone box. These    
are both red. The Post Office is a     
Savings Bank. It sells postcards, food 
and some clothes like gloves and       
legwarmers.
