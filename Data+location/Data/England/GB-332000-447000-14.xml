		<title>14HACKENSALL HALL AND FARM.</title>
		<content>   South of the village and east of    
 Knott End Golf links lie{Hackensall   
{ Hall}and{Farm}. There has been a Hall
 there since 1190, but the original one
 was burnt down, and the present Hall, 
 now a{listed}building, was built by   
 Richard and Anne Fleetwood in 1656.   
 The I.C.I. still extracts salt from   
 Preesall salt fields; the control of  
 the mineral rights determined their   
 purchase of the Hall from the Bourne  
 May family, but the tenants for the   
 past 70 years, the Ashworth family,   
 are guaranteed tenure during their    
 lifetime. A private residence not open
 to the public, the Hall is still very 
 much a loved and lived-in home.       
   A locked door separates Hackensall  
 Hall from Hackensall Farm, whose      
 building is really the servants'      
 quarters of the Hall. Sheltered by    
 tall trees is this fine dairy farm.   </content>
