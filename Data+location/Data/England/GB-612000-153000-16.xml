		<title>1620TH CENTURY NACKINGTON</title>
		<content> A new Canterbury to Dover by-pass     
 road cuts through the area and 2 new  
 bridges have been built over it, one  
 on the B2068 road near Winters Farm   
 and one in Stuppington Lane. In this  
 area nearer to Canterbury some modern 
 buildings have been erected. A small  
 complex of prestigious homes has been 
 built near{Stuppington Farm.}Some of  
 the 18th century farm buildings and   
 barns have been converted or very     
 tastefully and faithfully copied. The 
 Foundation of{Simon Langton Boys'}    
{School}goes back to 1218. Now a Kent  
 County Council Grammar School it has  
 over 600 pupils and moved to its new  
 building in Nackington Road in 1959.  
 Entry is by examination. It is hoped  
 that pupils will stay until the age of
 18, taking A Levels for entry to      
 University.
