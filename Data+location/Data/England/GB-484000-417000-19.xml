		<content> There are quite a number of clubs and 
 activities for people, young and not  
 so young, in Burton. For very young   
 children there is the Mother and      
 Toddler Group and the Pre-School Play 
 Group. For older children there is the
 Youth Club which is run in two        
 sections - a junior and a senior.     
 There are not any clubs specifically  
 for men, but there are for women such 
 as the Women's Institute, the Mothers'
 Union and the Housewives' Register.   
 Evening classes are held in the       
 primary school and can vary from year 
 to year. At the moment there is       
 Ladies' Keep Fit, Calligraphy,        
 Tapestry and Flower Arranging. In     
 other years there have been classes in
 Yoga, French for Holidays, Art and    
 Dress Making. Bingo is held weekly and
 is run by various groups in turn to   
 help to support their club.           </content>
