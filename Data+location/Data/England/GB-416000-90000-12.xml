 of orange or tea.You can have a bag of
 crisps.You can bring sandwiches with  
 something in them.We have a canteen

 the playground all year round and he  
 has a wooly thick coat and the gerbils
 are at the back of the classes and the
 fish have a large tank at Mrs Holt's  
 office and they are very small and    
 there is all sorts of fish in         
 there.Some are all coloured and some  
 aren't and they are very interesting.
