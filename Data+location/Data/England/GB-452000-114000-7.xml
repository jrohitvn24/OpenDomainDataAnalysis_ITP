 The EEC and government grants play and
 important role in the farmer's        
 decisions on these farms. Not long ago
 they built a cattle shed for which    
 they received a large grant. The      
 farmer admitted that the shed would   
 not be as large and complex without   
 the grant.                            
  The land farmed is very wet which    
 gives low grass yields of 2 tons per  
 field instead of 3. This is due to the
 clay content of the soil which causes 
 water to lie on the surface of the    
 land                                  
 Many jobs have been lost on the farm  
 due to mechanisation and todays       
 farming methods are less labour       
 intensive. A small crew of men run the
 two farms.
