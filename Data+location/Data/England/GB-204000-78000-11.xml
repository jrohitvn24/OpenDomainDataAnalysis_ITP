		<content>                                       
    THE TOURIST INDUSTRY IN THIS AREA  
 HAS GROWN RAPIDLY OVER THE PAST TWENTY
 YEARS. WHEREAS THIRTY YEARS AGO       
 HOLIDAY ACCOMMODATION WAS VIRTUALLY   
 UNKNOWN IN ST. TEATH, THERE ARE NOW   
 MANY HOLIDAY COTTAGES, A TOURIST      
 CARAVAN PARK AND A LARGE PROPORTION OF
 RESIDENTS PROVIDING BED AND BREAKFAST 
 FACILITIES.  TOURISTS USE ST. TEATH AS
 A CONVENIENT BASE FROM WHICH TO       
 EXPLORE THE SPECTACULAR COASTAQL      
 SCENERY OF NORTH CORNWALL.THE VILLAGE 
 POPULATION IS THEREFORE VASTLY        
 INCREASED DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS AND
 THIS PUTS A STRAIN ON LOCAL SERVICES. 
 NARROW COUNTRY LANES ARE UNSUITED TO  
 THE LARGE VOLUME OF TRAFFIC OCCASIONED
 BY THESE TOURISTS AND ACCESS TO NEARBY
 TOWNS IS MADE IMPOSSIBLE FOR THREE    
 MONTHS EVERY YEAR DUE TO LONG QUEUES  
 OF CARS AND CARAVANS.                 </content>
