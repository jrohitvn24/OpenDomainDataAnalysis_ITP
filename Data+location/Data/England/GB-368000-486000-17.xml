 around 1080 most likely being in the  
 care of monks in Covern Abbey,near    
 Middleham.Since the church has been   
 on this spot it has been in four      
 Dioceses,York, Chester,Ripon and now  
 Bradford.In 1417 the church was       
 rebuilt and has been restored since   
 then.The original Norman tower fell   
 down in 1772;it was rebuilt in 1787   
 using the original stone.1828 saw the 
 addition of the clock we see today.   
 Piers of the original Norman church   
 form part of the present church,the   
 front pair being octagonal.Box pews   
 from the 17th century can be found in 
 the side aisles.1614 is the date found
 on the pulpit which was part of a     
 Jacobean three decker pulpit.Dent     
 Marble edged with Barrow limestone    
 makes a most attractive chancel       
 floor,which is full of fossils.       </content>
