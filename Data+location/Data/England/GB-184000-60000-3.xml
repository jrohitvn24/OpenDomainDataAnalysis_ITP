		<content> At the back of the Belltower there was
 a garden which had a lawn with        
 gooseberry and blackcurrent bushes.   
 You can tell it was a lawn because    
 there are no trees there.The bushes no
 longer bear fruit as they are now     
 wild. The main trees are evergreens   
 and the main flowers are Campians,    
 Bluebells and Foxgloves.              
{COLAN CHURCH}was build in l250 and is 
 made of granite and slate with a tower
 and is very sturdy looking. By the    
 church door there is a pillar of      
 granite which was found by the OLD    
 CORNWALL SOCIETY in a hedge and in    
 l970 it was erected in the Church     
 grounds and is known as the {COLAN    
{CROSS. Outside the door there are some
{iron bars which are used for wiping   
{feet.The lamposts around the graveyard
{look Victorian.
