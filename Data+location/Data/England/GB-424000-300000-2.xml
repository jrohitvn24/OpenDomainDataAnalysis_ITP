		<title>02A DAY IN THE LIFE.....</title>
		<content> At seven o'clock I get up, make my bed
 and draw back my curtains.I go down   
 stairs and watch television until     
 eight o'clock,when I get washed and   
 dressed.Before I go to school I take  
 the dog to my Grandad's.              
        It is a Monday today,so I take 
 my swimming kit to school with me.At  
 nine o'clock the school bell goes and 
 I go into school with my friends.Mr.  
 Eames calls the register and we go    
 into assembly for songs,a story and   
 prayers.After assembly we go back to  
 the classroom and on the board is a   
 list  of work that we must finish     
 before the end of school.Just before  
 playtime, group one swimmers go       
 swimming to Atherstone.We have a small
 pool at school which was built by the 
 Parent's Association, but the top two 
 classes go to the larger pool using   
 the school mini bus.                  </content>
