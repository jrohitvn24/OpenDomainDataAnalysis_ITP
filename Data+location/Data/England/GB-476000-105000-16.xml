		<title>16SUGGESTED AREA IMPROVEMENTS</title>
		<content> 1.SHOPS These are a vital aspect of   
 our lifeand the area,being so rural,is
 not well served but at least it is    
 near to the shopping centres of       
 Chichester,Havant and Portsmouth.     
 Residents would particularly like to  
 see a Baker's shop,a Butcher's shop   
 and a clothes shop opened.            
 2.TRAVEL People were generally fairly 
 satisfied with the train service but  
 would like to see more buses.         
 3.PUBLIC SERVICES Surprisingly,many   
 people claimed to be dissatisfied with
 local milk deliveries,street lighting,
 and didn't like gas or electricity    
 meters.                               
 4.LEISURE In the smaller villages,    
 Hambrook and Woodmancote,people felt  
 that their opportunities for leisure  
 were non-existant.More youth and      
 social clubs seem to be in demand.
