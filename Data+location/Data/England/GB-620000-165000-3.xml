		<content> The natural history of the Highstead  
 Terrace.  This is mostly, open arable 
 land, well drained friable soil, a    
 'redsina'.  Here and there are patches
 of deciduous woodland, and the        
 remains of ancient hedgerows.  The    
 flora is typical of North East Kent.{ 
{ANIMALS:}Foxes, Badgers, Hares,       
 Rabbits, Hedgehogs, Rats, Mice, Voles,
 Moles, Stoats, Weasels, Toads. {      
{OTTERS }have been seen in the last    
 15 years.  Over 350 species of moths  
 and butterflies have been observed. { 
 BIRDS: all common wood field and      
 hedgerow birds. Within the overall    
 environment are 'islands' consisting  
 of old gravel pits and valley bottoms 
 with streams.  These micro            
 environments have their own ecologies.
 The Boyden Gate area seems not to be  
 under threat from the modern world.
