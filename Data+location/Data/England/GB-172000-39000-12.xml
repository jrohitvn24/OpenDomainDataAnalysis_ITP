		<title>12A "COFFIN DROP"</title>
		<content> At the end of Sparry Lane in          
 Carharrack is an old cottage.It is a  
 traditional granite building which has
 remained largely unchanged for many   
 years.It was probably built to house a
 local{mine worker}and his family.     
 One interesting feature of this       
 cottage is that there is a{"Coffin    
{Drop".}The staircase is very steep and
 narrow which makes it impossible for a
 coffin to be removed from an upstairs 
 room,so a hole has been specially cut 
 in the ceiling.                       
 When a person died they were often{   
{"Laid Out"}on their bed or placed in  
 an open coffin so that friends and    
 family could pay their{last respects.}
 When it was time for the{funeral}the  
 specially cut floorboards were removed
 leaving a hole through which the      
 coffin could be lowered.
