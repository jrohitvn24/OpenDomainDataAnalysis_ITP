		<title>07Hayle Rugby Club.</title>
		<content>  The Rugby Club in Hayle was founded  
  in 1877 by T.Edmund Hockin. In 1946 a
  new wooden club house was built and  
  then,in 1968,the present club house  
  was built. In the present clubhouse  
  there is a lounge and a much bigger  
  room where nearly everybody goes     
  during or after a match. You have to 
  pay for membership so that you can   
  purchace alcohol. In the rugby season
  which is from the first Saturday in  
  September to the last Saturday in    
  April, the big room is used for after
  matches and in the evening but you   
  can also rent it for private         
  functions. The club runs two senior  
  teams and one colts team for boys    
  under 19 years old. Over the years   
  some players have represented        
  cornwall and even a few have         
  represented England.
