		<title>18SNAITH COMMUNITY LIFE .1.</title>
		<content> Living in Snaith is quite a pleasant  
 experience. It is only a small town,  
 there is relatively little            
 unemployment, and the quality of      
 housing is good.                      
 There is something available to       
 support and enhance the life of       
 everyone.                             
 Under Fives.                          
 There is a regular Health clinic      
 organised by Dr Jennifer and two      
 Health Visitors. A playgroup operates 
 four mornings a week and the church   
 runs a mother and toddler group. There
 is a Nursery at the school and a play 
 area with swings and slides.          
 Five to Eleven                        
 All children go to the local primary  
 school.                               
 There are packs of cubs and brownies  
 opertating, and a Girl's Friendly     
 Society...(not always friendly).      </content>
