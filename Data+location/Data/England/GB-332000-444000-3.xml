		<title>03LAND RECLAMATION,FLEETWOOD</title>
		<content> New land has been created on the west 
 banks of the{River Wyre}by waste ash  
 from the boilers of the power station,
 (demolished in 1984).The ash was mixed
 with water,and spread layer by layer, 
 onto the sand banks.The land was sown 
 with grass and was then used for the  
 grazing of cattle.However,the cattle  
 began to show sign of weakness and    
 they were removed.                    
   Scientists,from Lancaster University
 found,at first, little animal life.   
 However after a few months,worms and  
 other insects were observed.Cattle    
 once again were allowed to graze,this 
 time with no ill effects.             
   The{Central Electricity Generating  
{Board,}left two lakes on the site as a
 bird sanctuary.Seagulls,which used to 
 rest and feed on the sea shore,now    
 prefer this area which is near the    
 Fleetwood tip.                        </content>
