The Grizedale valley is surrounded by forest, with open grassland in the valley bottom. This gives a wide range of habitats for birds and animals.&lt;br />&lt;br />The most spectacular animal is the red deer. The herd is increasing rapidly and has to be controlled by the Wildlife Rangers to ensure a strong herd and protect crops. Fallow deer also roam the woodlands.&lt;br />&lt;br />Red squirrel numbers have dropped dramatically because of a disease carried by their grey cousins. Greys are being trapped and shot in an attempt to reverse this decline, and squirrel feeders only accessible to reds have been placed in the forest. However, only a few pockets of red squirrels remain and it seems the battle has been lost.   &lt;br />
