		<content> Mr.Jim Kerr farms 330 acres at Worten 
 Home Farm.He has about 300 sheep which
 he keeps for their meat.He would like 
 to have some cattle but they are not a
 paying proposition.The cereal crops,  
 grown on his good land,are wheat,     
 barley,rape and oats,and he also grows
 peas and beans on the poorer land.It  
 is an extensive farm with three men to
 help and an extra one at pea harvest. 
 He has three combines and six         
 tractors.Most of his crops are grown  
 for cash though some go for animal    
 feed.His soil is a mixture of grade   
 two and grade three.He has trouble    
 with the River Stour flooding so he   
 cannot grow crops in that area.He is  
 not affected by recent changes in the 
 area as he is some way from the       
 housing estates and the by-pass.
