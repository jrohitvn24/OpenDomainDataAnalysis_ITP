		<title>06BLACKBIRD LEYS FARM</title>
		<content>     Blackbird Leys Farm consists of   
four hundred and sixty acres of which  
one hundred and ten are in grass and   
oil seed rape.   The rest is in        
cereals, barley and wheat.   The       
farmer also keeps about l00 beef       
cattle.   The farmer employs two       
workers.   He enjoys farming because   
he likes animals and working closely   
with the land.   The work is very hard 
and the days long and tiring.   He     
finds vandalism such as dumped cars    
and rubbish, left open gates, broken   
fences and arson very annoying.        
The farm will lose 200 acres when the  
new development of houses starts in    
l988.   This loss of land will create  
many problems.   The land  is used for 
the  disposal of two million gallons   
of sewage sludge a year. What will     
happen   to it?   One man will lose    
his job - one more for the dole queue. </content>
