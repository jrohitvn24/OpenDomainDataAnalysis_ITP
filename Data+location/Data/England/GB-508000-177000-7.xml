		<title>07Western International Market</title>
		<content>  There is a market in Hayes.  It is   
 called the Western International      
 Market. Every Sunday it is open       
 between 9.00 a.m. and 2.00 p.m. You   
 can buy clothing and footwear, toys,  
 vegetables, meat and many other items.
 The market is very big and it is      
 difficult to park as it is very busy. 
 Many people cannot get into the car   
 park. They park on the road instead   
 which causes traffic jams.
