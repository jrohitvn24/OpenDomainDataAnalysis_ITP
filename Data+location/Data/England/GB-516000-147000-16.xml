      There is a health centre situated
 on the south side of the A24          
 roundabout.The number of patients has 
 grown since it was opened in 1955.Two 
 doctors (Mr.and Mrs.Goode),nursing and
 pharmacy services are available.The   
 most common complaint the doctors     
 treat is Coryza (common cold).They see
 about 52 patients a day both children 
 and adults equally but more females   
 than males!                           
      The ambulance station in Spook   
 Hill serves the whole of the Dorking  
 area.Emergencies are taken to the main
 hospital in Redhill.                  
     The Fire service is situated next 
 to the ambulance station and covers   
 the same area. The fire men fight on  
 average 1 fire every week and often   
 use their advanced rescue services for
 road accidents.                       </content>
