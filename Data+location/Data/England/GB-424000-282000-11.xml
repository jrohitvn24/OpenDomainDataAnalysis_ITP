		<content> There has been a school in the village
 for over one hundred years, and the   
 logbooks of the present school go back
 to 1918.                              
                                       
 They present an interesting picture of
 life in a rural community between the 
 wars, with the closure of the school  
 for outbreaks of infectious diseases  
 as well as for more important events  
 such as the potato harvest and        
 haymaking time.                       
                                       
 The original school buildings still   
 stand in the village and are now      
 converted for use as the Doctor's     
 Surgery.
