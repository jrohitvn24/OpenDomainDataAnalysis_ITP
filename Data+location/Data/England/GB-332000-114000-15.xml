 We have been talking to Mrs.P.Hooper  
 and she has lived in Broadway for 35  
 years since the 1950's.She has told us
 about life in the 1950's.Nowadays some
 people use the bus service but many   
 now have a car.Only three Broadway    
 families had cars  in the 1950's.     
  Today children go to a new primary   
 school,in Broadway and then to the    
 Comprehensive school in Chard.In the  
 1950's the primary school was in      
 Broadway but the children went to a   
 Secondary Modern or a Grammar School  
 in Ilmiinster.                        
 The village has grown there were two  
 lots of council houses in 1950's but  
 there were no private estates.Also    
 there were no houses up Pound Road and
 up Brookside.
