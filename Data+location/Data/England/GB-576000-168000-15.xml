		<content> Sinclair C5                           
 It costs lp for the battery to bs     
 charged. The vehicle cost Â£299. They  
 are driven along by a washing machine 
 motor.  It is made from fibreglass.   
 You need to be fourteen years old to  
 drive one. When they first came out   
 they were Â£400 so they have gone down 
 rapidly as no one was buying because  
 of the cost. They were also too small 
 as the traffic could not see the C5.  
 Safety                                
 Safety in transport is very important 
 nowadays as most deaths are caused by 
 road accidents, crossing the road is  
 made easier by pelican and zebra      
 crossings. A bridge or subway are     
 useful for major roads or motorways   
 and all bridges have safety rails.    
 Before cars or any other vehicle can  
 be put on the road they have to go    
 through tough and difficult test.     </content>
