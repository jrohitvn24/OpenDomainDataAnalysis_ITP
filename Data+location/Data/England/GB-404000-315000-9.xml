It's up bright and early 8.00a.m.      
sharp. Into the bathroom she goes and  
gets ready. She has breakfast then     
books a taxi to take her to town at    
9.30am. From 8.00 t0 9.30. she does    
the housework, hoovering, washing and  
dusting. When the taxi arrives she     
goes to "Lo-Cost" Superstore to do the 
shopping, then returns home. Then she  
gets ready and walks to the fish-bar.  
A fish-bar is a place where you can    
buy cooked food, like fish and chips   
and other foods. When she gets there   
she serves people with what they want  
Sometimes she gets a little burnt      
because when you put the chips in the  
hot fat it spits. She is there for 8   
hours and gets very tired. When she    
gets home she goes to bed.             
                                       
                                       </content>
