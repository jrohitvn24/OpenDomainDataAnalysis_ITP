		<content> The population is thinly spread out   
 through the area.The major{village} on
 the north side is{Rodley}where the    
 population in and around the village  
 is between{150-200}.There are         
 not,however,many young people living  
 there.The area caters mainly for the  
 older generation who come for peace   
 and quiet or those who are local      
 farmers.The average age seems to be   
 35-40.                                
 The area to the south of the River has
 a similar population,approximately    
 150-200.Again it consists mainly of   
 the over-40's.The population does seem
 to have been very stable over the last
 few years,however,since those who have
 moved away to urban areas have been   
 replaced by families moving into the  
 area to find peace and quiet away from
 the towns and cities.
