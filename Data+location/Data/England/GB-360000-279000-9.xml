		<content> Every Saturday morning I go to "The   
 Mounts", a riding school for an hours 
 lesson. It costs Â£3.50 per hour. There
 are three other girls with me. My pony
 is called Rocket and she is very      
 strong. Our riding teacher is a good  
 sport. Sometimes we go out for hacks  
 on the common and that's great. I     
 enjoy these lessons and I hope to have
 a pony of my own soon.                
     Out of    families at our small   
 school of 57 children, 3 families have
 one horse, one family has two horses  
 and James &amp; Abigail's family own three
 horses.                               
     In Spring and Summer about 7      
 horses are left out on the common and 
 16 donkeys are turned loose each      
 morning.                              
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
