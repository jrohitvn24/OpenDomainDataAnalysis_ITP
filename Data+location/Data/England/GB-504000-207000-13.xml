		<content>   {Housing}in the area is a mixture of
{rented}and{private.}In the new part of
 the town the houses were built by the 
 New Town's Commission (wound up about 
 1980) and the Council. Many of these  
 are now privately owned.              
    Adeyfield, Gadebridge, Warners End 
 and Highfield are more established    
{neighbourhoods}of the new town, but   
 Grovehill and Woodhall Farm are still 
 expanding.                            
    The majority of the housing is     
{terraced,}but there are many          
{semi-detached}and{detached}houses.    
 There are also several{low rise blocks
{of flats}and{maisonettes,}but few     
{tower blocks.                         
  {Older properties}(mainly Victorian) 
 are to be found in old Hemel          
 Hempstead and off the Marlowes.
