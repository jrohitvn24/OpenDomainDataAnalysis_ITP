		<content> Many people are 'new' to the area,    
 living in houses built in the 1960's. 
 Most were concerned with the fact that
 'Green Belt'land should not be lost to
 further development.An assosiation    
 called the'Three Arrows Residents'    
 Association'has been formed with that 
 purpose in mind.                      
 People registered quite strong concern
 at the lack of pedestrian facilities  
 on the main Bolton Road.              
 Many were concerned with the lack of  
 playgrounds and play areas for        
 children in the area and wished to see
 swings etc. installed.Many people     
 thought that this lack of facilities, 
 especially for teenagers,was a primary
 cause of vandalism.                   
 The people interviewed for this       
 information came from the centre of   
 our survey block.
