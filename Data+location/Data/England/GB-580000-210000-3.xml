 Fairplay House was built in 1928 by   
 the Labour Peer Lord Braintree. When  
 he died in the mid 1950's the house   
 was sold to the London Borough of East
 Ham and converted into an old people's
 home. At this time the name was       
 changed from Crockies to Fairplay     
 House as being more suitable. When the
 railway was abandoned in 1963 there   
 was no  adequate transport link       
 with East London and it was taken over
 by the Education Department.The Centre
 now provides short-term residential   
 courses in various aspects of outdoor 
 education for the London Borough of   
 Newham's schools, colleges, youth     
 organisations, teachers and leaders.  
 The courses include environmental     
 studies, sailing, canoeing,           
 orienteering, walking and camping     
 expeditions.                          </content>
