 Out of 64 houses in the area, 16      
 households are retired and 19         
 households have children under the age
 of 18 years. Almost every house has a 
 freezer of necessity, the shopping    
 being done once a week. Surplus fruit 
 and vegetables from the gardens are   
 also frozen, and jam making is        
 popular. The majority of households   
 use electricity for cooking, the rest 
 having bottled gas, oil-fired or      
 solid                                 
 fuel Agas. There is no piped gas. A   
 few people have micro-wave ovens.     
 Many households keep more than one    
 pet; dogs and cats are common. Some   
 residents keep a pony or donkey and   
 others have poultry and small caged   
 animals such as rabbits and guinea    
 pigs.
