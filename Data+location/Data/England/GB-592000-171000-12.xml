		<content> A DAY IN MY LIFE.BY DEREK GRANTHAM(13)
  I usually wake up around 0600 and,   
 after washing and dressing, I eat some
 cornflakes. I then brush my teeth and 
 go outside to play football. I play   
 until about 1000 and then I take my   
 dog for a run. At 1100 I usually call 
 for a friend, and we either go to the 
 fair,the arcades or the beach.At the  
 beach there is not much sand,but there
 are still things like crabs etc.      
 Sometimes a stray dog follows us and  
 we walk along the breakers and throw a
 stick out to sea, to watch him swim   
 after it. At 1400 I return home, eat a
 quick snack and go fishing or play    
 football. Then at 1700 I eat my       
 dinner, normally a plate of chips,some
 vegetables and meat.After this, at    
 about 1800, I play football AGAIN! At 
 1900 I watch telly and  I go to bed at
 about 2200.                           </content>
