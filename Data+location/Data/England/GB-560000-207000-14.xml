		<title>14PIG FARMING IN ROXWELL</title>
		<content>  {Stonehill Farm}is used for breeding 
{PIGS.}It covers three acres of land   
 and has several sheds for pigs at     
 different ages. Each sow has about ten
 piglets at a time and they stay with  
 their mothers for two to three weeks. 
   They are kept in special pens so the
 sows cannot squash them. The piglets  
 are then separated from their mothers 
 and put into pens with about          
 twenty-five other pigs. There are over
 two hundred and fifty pigs in the     
 shed. They are called weaners at this 
 age. After this some pigs are sent to 
 be fattened at another farm and then  
 slaughtered for meat. There are about 
 twenty-five other sows expecting their
 piglets and some more in another shed 
 with the boars. Some of the sows are  
 kept in a shed and have a field to go 
 into as well. The farm was quite      
 spacious and the pigs clean and happy.</content>
