		<content> Following typical settlement patterns 
 found in much of Cornwall, farms are  
{scattered}around the landscape, for   
 the most part within the curtilage of 
 their own land. Only{two hamlets}have 
 developed: St Minver in the north west
 and Amble in the south east. And while
 the economic backbone of the block is 
 still as it always has been,{mixed}   
{farming,}since 1945{tourism}has played
 an increasingly important part.       
 Co_incidentally, full_time labour     
 requirements on such farms have been  
 reduced to such an extent that the    
 survey found hardly any examples in   
 1985 of an agricultural labourer.     
 However there were over 20 people in  
 seasonal or full_time tourist_linked  
 employment. The majority of the       
 inhabitants are{car owners}who have   
 to travel out of the block for work,  
 school and most of their shopping.    </content>
