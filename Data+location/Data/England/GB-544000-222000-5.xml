		<title>05LITTLE HADHAM CHURCH</title>
		<content>    The small church of St Cecilia is  
 situated halfway between Hadham Hall  
 and Little Hadham which lies in the   
 valley of the River Ash. Between 1276 
 and 1870 the village church was a     
 'chapel' under the larger Much Hadham 
 parish.Today Little Hadham shares its 
 vicar with Albury, a village 2 miles  
 to the north.                         
     Much of St Cecilia's dates from   
 late Medieval times; restored from    
 1883 onwards. Flintstone is the main  
 building material used, and the tower,
 containing 5 bells, is capped by a    
 small lead spire.                     
     Most noticable internal features  
 are a 1633 '3 decker'pulpit, 2 brasses
 of the arms of a Bishop of London,    
 and a wood screen, partly 16th century
 About 24 Capels of Hadham Hall were   
 buried in the vault under the altar.
