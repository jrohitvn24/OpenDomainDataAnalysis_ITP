		<title>19FASHION IN WESTCOTT</title>
		<content>      The people of Westcott change    
 their fashions and lifestyles as they 
 grow older.  In summer teenage boys   
 wear baggy trousers, white leisure    
 boots and lightweight raincoats with a
 hood.  The girls wear white skirts,   
 white jackets and white shoes.        
      In winter leisure boots are still
 in fashion but warmer trousers and    
 jackets are worn by both sexes.       
      The older people of Westcott     
 usually just wear what is comfortable 
 such as platform shoes and cardigans. 
 The middle aged people wear flared    
 jeans, striped shirts and jumpers.    
 The ladies wear skirts, sandles and   
 light tops.                           
      Dorking and Guildford are        
 essential for clothes and cosmetic    
 supplies, as there are no clothes     
 shops in Westcott.
