		<title>03CLEVELAND - N YORK MOORS</title>
		<content> Apart from a small area of coniferous 
 woodland managed by the Forestry      
 Commission on the slopes of the       
 western escarpment, the area is       
 typical heather clad moor at a height 
 of 300-400 metres. There are no       
 buildings in the area and people are  
 rarely seen working: workers are      
 shepherds, game-keepers and forestry  
 workers.                              
 The area is crossed by two old routes,
 The Rudland Rigg road crosses it N/S  
 and the abandoned Middlesborough/     
 Rosedale railway build 1870-1 crosses 
 N/S and W/E. These routes are         
 regularly used by walkers either for  
 short local walks or as part of long  
 distance walks e.g. The Lyke Wake, a  
 40 mile W/E crossing of the highest   
 points of the North York Moors and    
 three others; Rosedale Circiut; White 
 Rose Challenge and Cleveland Way.     </content>
