		<content> In Chedworth we have lots of special  
 arts and crafts.The most unusual is   
{screen printing.}My mum and dad make  
 smocks.They make them like this.First 
 they draw pictures of the smocks,then 
 they print the front and back then    
 wash the screen and sew the smocks up 
 .Then they sell them at the Corn Hall 
 or Covent Garden.We have a{potter}in  
 the village.He gets his clay from     
 the rivers he says it does not dry so 
 quickly and is easy to work with.He   
 makes plates,bowls,jugs,cups and      
 saucers then he sells them at         
 markets.His wife is an{author.}She    
 writes paper back books for little    
 children.Her latest book is a hard    
 back book for adults about herb       
 gardens.Her books are normaly about   
 family disasters when doing something.
