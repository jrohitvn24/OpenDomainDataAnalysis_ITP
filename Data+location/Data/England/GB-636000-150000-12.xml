 Association is a group of people that 
 looks after their interests. The      
 Ratepayers have been going since 1971.

 buildings and objects that will spoil 
 the area. People complain about road  
 surfaces and country{conservation.}The
 dirty beaches in Walmer and Deal are  
 caused by fishermen and people object 
 to fishermen parking on the promenade.

 an old school and the local people    
 hope soon it will be a{Community      
{Centre.}In the 1990's we might have a 
 swimming pool in Walmer or Deal. The  
 Walmer Ratepayers has{300 members}and 
 each household pay Â£1.50 per year.
