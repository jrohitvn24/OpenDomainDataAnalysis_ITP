 I live at 60 Hillside Avenue.I live in
 a sort of countryside town,in this    
 town of Bridgnorth. My house is near a
 new by-pass.There is a new bridge over
 the River Severn as well as the old   
 stone one.There are some factories    
 near to where I live :Star            
 Aluminiuim,Tatung Electrical and      
 Choron Pipes. The Lowtown is not very 
 modern,many of the shops are old,one  
 is very old,it is half timbered.Most  
 of the really interesting things are  
 in the High Town area.Lowtown, towards
 the bridge is all very old.Once a     
 great inland port with ships          
 called'trows passing from London via  
 the sea,up the Severn to Shrewsbury.  
 There are a few shops left open,one   
 bank and a small sub post office.It is
 an unused part of town with cars      
 passing through,but never stopping.   </content>
