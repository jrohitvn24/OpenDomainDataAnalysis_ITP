		<title>19LOCAL CHARACTER OF ELMBRIDGE</title>
		<content> Local character born in Randan Woods. 
 When talking to him he was wearing    
 brown smock with string round his     
 waist. We talked sitting on bench     
 seats in his kitchen, his farm dog by 
 his side. Joined by his son they told 
 of their only outings in the year to  
 the Royal Show and weekly to          
 Kidderminster market. His spare time  
 is spent gardening and fishing in his 
 own pool which he cleaned out two     
 years ago and with help from Severn   
 Trent water board stocked with perch  
 and trout, which the local herons     
 would enjoy if allowed. An early riser
 he walks half the farm before         
 breakfast inspecting stock and pool.  
 All vegetables home grown, he gives   
 ladies posies of flowers from his     
 country style garden of old fashioned 
 flowers and shrubs. A teller of tales 
 recomends good food hard work laughter</content>
