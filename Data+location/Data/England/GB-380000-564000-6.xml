		<title>06CRUELSYKE, HAYDON BRIDGE</title>
		<content> These are two interesting houses to   
 the north of Haydon Bridge. They stand
 amid Permanent pasture land.{Cruelsyke
 was built in the early nineteenth     
 century, and was named after a burn   
 which runs nearby. It was the scene of
 a{Border raid}after which the burn ran
 red with Scottish blood. Mr. &amp; Mrs.   
 Heslop live there now &amp; breed         
 successful{racing greyhounds.}The dogs
 are walked for miles each day. They   
 get three meals a day and sometimes   
 honey and sherry. We found that Mr. &amp; 
 Mrs. Anderson farmed forty acres at   
{Westley Bank}in 1851. They had nine   
 children and employed one labourer. In
 1985, Mr. &amp;. Mrs. Nagel own the house 
 and have two children. This           
 illustrates the fall in{family size}  
 over the last century. The present    
 family owns a shop.
