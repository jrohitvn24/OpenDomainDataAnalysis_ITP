		<title>12Linslade-A Commuter Town</title>
		<content>    At about eight o'clock in the      
 morning some people are getting on the
 train to go to London to work. Most   
 commuters get on the fast line trains.
 Most of Linslade was built around the 
 railway, which was built in the       
 eighteen hundreds. Many people who    
 work in London commute from Linslade. 
 Some people cycle, drive or walk from 
 their homes to the station.           
    There are trains from Linslade to  
 London every half hour, but in peak   
 times there are more. The fastest     
 trains to London from here take 35    
 minutes but the slow ones take about  
 55 minutes. The reason why workers    
 live here is because they don't want  
 to live in a large, bustling city with
 lots of noise. Also, if you move about
 ten miles nearer to London, the price 
 of houses goes up about ten thousand  
 pounds.                               </content>
