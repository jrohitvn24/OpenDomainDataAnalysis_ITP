		<content> We live in and around a very rural    
 part of{Wiltshire}in the south of     
{England.                              
   The land around is mainly           
 agricultural and it is still possible 
 to find people engaged in rural       
 crafts.                               
   We found it very interesting        
 interveiwing local inhabitants of the 
 area that we have always known, but   
 never realised how much they know     
 about the locality. The places we     
 looked at in detail are typical of the
 area. We have no large industries or  
 over powering buildings to spoil the  
 natural serenity of the surroundings. 
   The largest village in our block is 
{Tisbury}and it was possible for us to 
 study the life and surroundings of a  
 typically rural community.
