		<title>03LANGRISH MANOR FARM</title>
		<content> The farm has been owned by the Lambert
 family for 80 years.They farm cereal  
 crops, cattle for milk and beef, and  
 other protein crops. The EEC quota    
 forced the farm to destroy 20         
 cattle. Grain sales depend on the     
 Russians as they dominate the grain   
 market. Crops change nearly every year
 to meet with public demand.The Govern-
 ment buys any surplus grain from the  
 farm and it can be stored for up to 12
 years. The EEC quota reduced the value
 of a cow from Â£700 to Â£400.The value  
 of a farm can change in a matter of   
 months, so there are subsidies from   
 time to time. If disease spreads, a   
 break crop(cereals etc.) are grown to 
 lower the extent of the disease.In the
 winter,turnips or grass(eaten by sheep
 )are grown. 22 people worked on the   
 farm at first, but now only 4 people  
 work there.                           </content>
