		<title>07WORK AT A HOSPITAL</title>
		<content>    My mum works at a hospital and she 
 says it is hard work and in the summer
 it is very hot.  She comes home very  
 tired and as soon as she gets in my   
 dad makes her a cup of tea. She drinks
 it in front of the television.        
   At the hospital my mum's job is to  
 put all the instruments used on a     
 trolley for the doctors to use.       
   My mum works in the Maternity part  
 of the Royal Berkshire Hospital.  It  
 is a large building with many levels  
 to it.  It is a fairly new wing.
