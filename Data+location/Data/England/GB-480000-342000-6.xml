		<content> After school I went on a cycle ride   
 to the old air base, situated near    
{Staunton.}I reached the bumpy muddy   
 track which leads towards the         
 abandoned air base. I decided to      
 explore. Some rooms had the bones of  
 trapped animals which had died.       
 Other rooms are just derelict. After  
 exploring I decided to go home.       
   During the weekend I play on my     
 computer. At 8.10am I go to{Grantham  
 to do my Gold swimming award with my  
 brother. I do some shopping and come  
 back. I feed my finger devouring      
 rabbit. My brother and I set off on a 
 bike ride to {Staunton in the Vale.}We
 come back over the bridge over the A1 
 and return down Vicarage Lane.        
 I sometimes have a three course Sunday
 lunch at the Manor Hotel in{Long      
{Bennington. }
