		<title>15    Order Of St.John</title>
		<content> After the closing of the hospital of  
 St.John at Lt.Maplestead,the order of 
 Knights Hospitallers disappeared, but 
 in 1836 the Order of St.John of       
 Jerusalem was refounded.Early this    
 century the church of England gave the
 Round Church back to the Order.The    
 Vicar,Rev. K.Belben,is Chaplain of the
 Order. He wears a tippet over his     
 cassock lined in red, showing that    
 originally Chaplains were cardinals.  
 There is a St.John's cross embroidered
 on it. Mr. Felton,an elderly man who  
 the class interviewed,is a serving    
 brother of the Order. In the Middle   
 Ages Serving Brothers looked after the
 Knights in the Chapel. On 16th June,  
 1985 there was the Annual St.John's   
 service in the Round Church.The Order 
 now has three functions-to teach first
 aid,to run the ambulance service and  
 to run an eye hosital in Jerusalem.   </content>
