		<content> The 1985 DOMESDAY PROJECT started when
 CLASS 5-thirty 9-10 year olds-were    
 watching "Zig Zag".The programme told 
 us all about it and we were so        
 interested our teacher,Mrs.           
 Williams,sent for information.When it 
 arrived we chose 20 subjects to find  
 out about.With parents help we VISITED
 farms and factories,INTERVIEWED and   
 QUESTIONED police,firemen,elderly     
 residents and shoppers and made a     
 SURVEY of village life.In the         
 classroom we PROCESSED piles of       
 completed QUESTIONNAIRES.When we had  
 written a subject in about 140 words  
 we transferred it to the computer.We  
 took four photographs and did a land  
 cover and amenities count.It was hard 
 work but great fun.We found out lots  
 about where we live.
