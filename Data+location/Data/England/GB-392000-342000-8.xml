		<content>     In my street,my friend Gary and   
myself have found a way of Break       
Dancing that no one else knows how to  
do.We have thought about doing         
something to impress the others for a  
long time.They gather at the corner of 
our street every night but Gary and I  
tend not to bother with them.We had    
higher ambitions.                      
     One day we decided that we would  
put on a show to really impress        
them.Gary began by spinning on his head
and doing a backflip over me.They were 
really impressed.However Beany came    
along and boasted how much better he   
was at Break Dancing and then he       
started to give a demonstration.However
he slipped and fell on Brenda's foot   
who then struck him over the head,Gary 
and I couldn't stop laughing but we    
thought it was to avoid Beany since    
then.    Lee Murfin and Gary Latham    </content>
