		<title>12CORNARD MERE</title>
		<content>  The Mere is an unusual,if not unique,
type of habitat for south-west Suffolk.
It is the remains of what was once a   
great lake in inter-glacial times.It   
still floods in winter and dries out   
completely by mid summer.A wide variety
of wetland plants can be found, and    
the area of 5.26 hectares has been     
designated a Site of Special Scientific
Interest.It is common land and up till 
the mid 1950's the land was grazed.It  
was left unmanaged until 1973,when     
Little Cornard Parish Council agreed to
lease the site to the Suffolk Trust for
Nature Conservation as a nature reserve
   There are many species of water     
plants to be seen, and the area        
attracts a wide variety of birds.      
Lizards,frogs and grass snakes have    
been reported,and insects are numerous 
and diverse.The Mere boasts one of     
Britain's rarest trees,the Black Poplar</content>
