		<title>18        MY HOBBY</title>
		<content> My name is Michael and I am in charge 
 of the computer while the rest of the 
 class feeds in the information that   
 they have collected.I like this job   
 because I have got my own computer and
 I like typing in more or less anything
 at home.I usually type in games from  
 a computer book or I like trying to   
 make them up myself and fiddle around 
 with them.I usually get my magazines  
 from Barnstaple when I go shopping    
 because the computer facilites in     
 Ilfracombe are poor.I think computers 
 are very handy if you are a business  
 man and have lots of files to look at.
 I would like to invent a small box to 
 fit on to a computer so that the blind
 can use it.It could have a microphone 
 so that whatever you say the computer 
 will talk to you.You would also be    
 able to get ones that translate into  
 different languages.                  </content>
