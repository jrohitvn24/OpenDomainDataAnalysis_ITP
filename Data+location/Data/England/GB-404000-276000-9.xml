		<title>09BIRMINGHAM WORCESTER CANAL</title>
		<content>On Monday 3rd.June class 3 went out to 
walk along Kings Norton canal to see   
the landscape.First we walked down to  
the canal.The first thing we noticed   
was the greenery. Our group went to the
left.We saw boats moving and staying   
still.My group leader was Mrs.Legg.We  
saw different trees with blossom on    
most most of them.Also there was lots  
of blossom in the canal.Just in front  
of the bridge there is a sewage pipe   
and in the olden days there was a fire 
door on every bridge. On our walk we   
saw lots of boats and some of the      
people waved to us.If we looked up to  
the sky it was lovely and blue except  
for a few clouds.We got a good view of 
St.Nicholas Church.We saw some reeds   
and bulrushes,which were growing in    
the canal.They came upto my knees.
