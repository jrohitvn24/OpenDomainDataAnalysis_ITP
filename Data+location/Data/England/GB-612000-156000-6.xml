		<title>06Education in Canterbury (1)</title>
		<content>   Within the Canterbury division there
 are 11 secondary schools with 8,541   
 pupils, 40 primary{schools}with 8,540 
 pupils and 3 special schools with 180 
 pupils. 912 teachers are employed.    
   In Canterbury itself there are 2    
{secondary modern,}1{comprehensive,}1  
 bi-lateral and 3{grammar schools.}    
   A middle school scheme was adopted  
 by the L.E.A. in 1969 but many new    
 buildings were needed for which the   
 approval was not given. The           
 Conservative government elected in    
 1979 gave education authorities a     
 choice of either implementing the     
 comprehensive schemes or withdrawing  
 them. Canterbury withdrew their scheme
 and there are no new plans for        
 comprehensive schooling in Canterbury.
   However, St.Anselm's - a Roman      
 Catholic Secondary school- is         
 organised as a comprehensive.         </content>
