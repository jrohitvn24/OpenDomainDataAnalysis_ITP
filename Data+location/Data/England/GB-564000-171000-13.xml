		<content>THE AREA WE STUDIED IS A MULTIFAITH    
SOCIETY.THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE ARE     
CHRISTIANS.THEY BELIEVE THAT JESUS IS  
THE SON OF GOD.USUALLY THEY ATTEND     
CHURCH ON SUNDAYS,AND SOMETIMES OTHER  
DAYS.EACH CHURCH HAS ITS OWN CLERGYMAN 
WHO MAY BE CALLED A RECTOR,VICAR,PRIEST
,MINISTER OR PASTOR.THE ALTAR IS THE   
MOST SACRED PART OF THE CHURCH,AND IT  
IS HERE THE CHRISTIANS COME DURING THE 
HOLY COMMUNION SERVICE.BAPTISM IS USED 
TO BAPTISE BABIES.THE BABY IS GIVEN A  
CHRISTIAN NAME AND IS WELCOMED TO THE  
CHURCH.WHEN THE BABY IS BAPTISED IT    
CAN'T MAKE ITS OWN PROMISE,SO IT MAKES 
THE PROMISE WHEN IT IS OLDER.DURING THE
YEAR,SPECIAL SERVICES ARE HELD.AT      
HARVEST TIME THERE IS A HARVEST        
FESTIVAL.AT CHRISTMAS THERE IS A CAROL 
SERVICE AND AT EASTER THERE IS A       
SERVICE TO CELEBRATE JESUS RISING FROM 
THE DEAD.                              </content>
