		<content> Government policy has a great effect  
 on farming today  and in April l984   
 milk quotas were imposed on farmers.  
 Forest Farm was told that it was      
 over its quota and so needed to       
 cutback. The farmer was very fortunate
 in that during the winter of 1983/1984
 the cows had a high grade feed, giving
 a high yield on which the quota  was  
 based. When they had sold ten cows    
 they were within their quota. Now in  
 1985 the herd has stabilised at 108   
 milking cows with 18  heifers and 33  
 calves. Friesians  are kept because   
 they have a good milk yield, calve    
 easily and are also good for beef. The
 herd has been built up from  two cows 
 which cost Â£34 each, in 1946 to its   
 present size. With the present over   
 production of milk in the E.E.C. there
 are no plans for further expansion.
