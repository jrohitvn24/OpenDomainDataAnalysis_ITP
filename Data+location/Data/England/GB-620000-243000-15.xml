   I get up at 6.30 and  go  downstairs
and have breakfast and  then  help wash
up.  I then go upstairs and have a wash
and get dressed.  I usually sort out my
school bag and go to school at 8.45. We
go in at 9 o'clock, have  the  register
and then got to the hall for  Assembly.
We  have  Maths  or   Spellings   until
playtime  at  10.30  which lasts for 20
minutes.   More lessons  and  then I go
home for dinner at 12 o'clock. At  1.30
school starts again and we do art work,
games or story until home-time at 3.30.
                                       
   At home I have to do a little home- 
work. I have my tea at 5 o'clock, play 
or watch  television  until bedtime at 
about 9.30 pm.                         
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
