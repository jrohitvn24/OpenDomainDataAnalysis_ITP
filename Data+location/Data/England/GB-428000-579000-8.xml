		<title>08EMPLOYMENT  BLYTH</title>
		<content>{We did a survey in our class of the   
{jobs our dads and mams do.            
   Most of the men work in the coal    
 mines. The second most popular job for
 men is factory work. Other jobs were  
 things like electrician, policeman,   
 machanic and labourers. Out of the    
 fifty men in our survey eight were    
 unemployed. Most dads work in Blyth or
 in the towns nearby. Four dads work   
 abroad. Half of the mams we found out 
 about stay at home. Most of those who 
 work are either factory workers or    
 shop assistants. All the mams work in 
 Blyth. We looked at a survey of jobs  
 done two hundred years ago,to see if  
 the jobs had changed much. Then, most 
 of the men were either sailors or had 
 something to do with ships.There were 
 no miners or factory workers.
