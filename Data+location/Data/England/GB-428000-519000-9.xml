		<title>09Farming in Brafferton</title>
		<content>      The average size of farms in the 
 area is between 180 and 200 acres.    
                                       
     {Mixed farming}is the most common 
 type practised here.Crops grown       
 include wheat which is grown for      
 cash,barley which is grown for cattle 
 feed,and grass for silage.There are   
 also some potatoes,oil seed rape,and  
 root crops such as beet.              
                                       
     {Cattle}is the main live-stock    
 with the major variety being          
 Friesian.The primary emphasis is on   
 fattening for beef but there is also  
 some dairying.                        
                                       
      The area does contain some sheep 
 on rough grazing as well as a few     
 pigs kept for fattening for Christmas.
