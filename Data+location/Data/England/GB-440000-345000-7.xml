		<title>07HEANOR PARISH CHURCH</title>
		<content> The total cost of rebuilding since    
 1978 has now been raised -            
 Â£220,000.The church now comprises     
 three different architrectural styles,
 the tower (15th century), the north   
 aisle (Victorian), the remainder      
 (modern). Subsidence of foundations   
 necessitated demolition of the south  
 side, choir and sanctuary. The former 
 east end is now a church hall with    
 outside paved area and modern kitchen 
 and storeroom facilities. There are   
 toilets and an upstairs meeting room. 
 Gas heating and carpeting have made   
 the service much more comfortable.    
 Movable pews and altar allow us to    
 vary the arrangement for different    
 occasions and sliding doors permit    
 extension of seating into the hall    
 when necessary. Most regular          
 worshippers are very satisfied with   
 the rebuilt church.                   </content>
