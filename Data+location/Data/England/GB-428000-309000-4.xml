		<title>04APPLEBY VILLAGE CONTINUED</title>
		<content>  Recently there have been suggestions 
 that Appleby may be affected by       
 boundary changes and moved into       
{Warwickshire.}Most villagers do not   
 want this to happen.In addition there 
 have been plans put forward to{develop
 9 acres of land in the middle of the  
 village for{housing.}Again this is not
 popular.However it seems that the     
 local council will allow a smaller    
 development of 50 houses on the       
 western end of the village.           
  One problem facing the village is    
 that a large proportion of the village
 are{elderly}(109 over the age of 70   
 while only 72 of primary school age)  
 and they find{transport}a difficulty. 
 They do not like using buses(4 on a   
 weekday)and those over 70 do not like 
 driving cars.Many of these people     
 retired to Appleby from Birmingham and
 have no family locally to help.       </content>
