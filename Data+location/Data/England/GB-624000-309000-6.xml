 Centre,which covers 4\ acres of land  
 and employs 26 people including 2 on  
 Y.T.S., believes that gardening is now
 Britian's No 1. leisure activity.     
   Each week between 5000 and 6000     
 people visit this Garden Centre.They  
 are particularly busy on Saturday and 
 Sunday and the plants and shrubs      
 purchased are usually a joint decision
 of the couples.                       
   There has been a steady increase in 
 the sales at the Centre, although over

 has slowed down. This year ,however,  
 many plants were purchased in the     
 early Summer to replace those which   
 were lost during the very hard winter.
   People in the Sprowston area are

 plants,probably due to the excellent
