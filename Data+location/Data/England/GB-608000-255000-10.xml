		<title>10People's Jobs in Creeting</title>
		<content>    Although the majority of land in   
Creeting is used for farming, only     
about 2% of the population of 800 is   
employed in it.                        
    Most of these people are working   
with cereal crops and pigs, though a   
few are involved in growing fruit and  
vegetables.                            
    Much of the population commute into
Needham Market, Stowmarket, Ipswich,   
Martlesham and even London.            
    Their work is varied. Several are  
involved in computer design and        
technology, electronics and            
accountancy. Other jobs include        
clerical work, teaching, child         
evangelism, plumbing and building.     
    Several people move around: lorry  
drivers,groundsmen and insurancemen.   
         Out of the people covered in  
this survey the unemployment rate was  
low.                                   </content>
