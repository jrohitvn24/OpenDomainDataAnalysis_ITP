		<title>12GILMORTON CRICKET CLUB</title>
		<content> This was formed in 1971 by local      
 residents to play social matches      
 against nearby village teams.After 3  
 separate grounds were used in the     
 first 4 years,a lease was obtained on 
 the present ground at Lutterworth     
 Road,Gilmorton.1979 saw the entry into
 Division Six of the Rugby Advertiser  
 League played on Wednesday evenings.  
 Today the club has over 40 members and
 a thriving junior section for children
 over 5 years old. Friendly matches are
 played each Sunday throughout the     
 cricket season and continued success  
 in the Evening League has advanced    
 Gilmorton to Division Three.          
 The local village identity is still   
 retained as all members are either    
 local residents or have strong        
 connections with Gilmorton,thus       
 preserving the original concept of the
 founders.                             </content>
