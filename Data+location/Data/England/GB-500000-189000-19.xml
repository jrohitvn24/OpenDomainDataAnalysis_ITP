		<title>19Chalfont House Ch St Peter</title>
		<content> Chalfont House is situated east of the
London Road.Now owned by British Alcan 
it was once the most important house in
Chalfont St Peter.Most of its grounds  
are now the Gerrards Cross golf course.
 It was built in 1792 and owned by the 
Hibbert family who had made their money
n the slave trade.                     
 The first Lombardy poplars to be seen 
in this country  were grown in the park
and there is an attractive Cedar tree  
by the house.Edward Lutyens designed   
an Italian garden there.               
 The River Misbourne flowing through   
the parkland has been dammed to form a 
lake that is a home for much wildlife. 
 The house was once used as a hotel for
some time.                             
 Public footpaths go through the park  
giving pleasant views of the house and 
grounds.                               
                                       </content>
