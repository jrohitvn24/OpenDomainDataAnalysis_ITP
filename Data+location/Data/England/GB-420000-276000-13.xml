		<title>13Building Survey</title>
		<content> Mrs James took our group to Balsall   
 Street East junction where we were    
 going to observe the buildings along  
 Station Road to Needlers End Lane. Our
 job was to find out if the buildings  
 were very old, Victorian, 1920's/30', 
 1950's or modern.                     
 We started to view the buildings on   
 one side. Many houses were extremely  
 interesting. One lady told us about a 
 bench mark that was printed on one of 
 the walls of her house. Apparently a  
 bench mark was put there to measure   
 the height of the surrounding land.   
 Another interesting point was an old  
 Tudor house. The craftsmanship on it  
 was lovely, the house also had its own
 coat of arms. Alongside the house     
 there was a barn,it had the same charm
 as the house. This Tudor building     
 seemed to clash with the modern houses
 all around.                           </content>
