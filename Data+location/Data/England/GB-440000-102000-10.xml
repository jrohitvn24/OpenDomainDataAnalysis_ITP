		<content> It is pleasing to note that           
 nightingales have bred successfully   
 this summer,a 50% increase on previous
 years.The montague Harrier has        
 returned to a joining area,it's       
 location a closely guarded secret.The 
 most exciting species seen this year  
 is the Wryneck.Although none have been
 observed on the site they have been   
 observed locally throughout the spring
 and summer indicating that they have  
 bred although as yet no nests have    
 been located.At present man is able to
 expand in his variable pursuits and   
 move about the forest without         
 detriment to the bird life and there  
 is no reason why he should not        
 continue to do so provided the puplic 
 is kept aware of the need to preserve 
 our heritage.
