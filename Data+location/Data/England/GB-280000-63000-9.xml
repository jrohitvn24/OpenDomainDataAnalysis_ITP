		<title>09Buckyette Guest House</title>
		<content> Buckyette is a guest house and it is  
 very nice.  Buckyette has 7 bedrooms  
 and 84 beds, including some in flats  
 that were barns.  The house is 114    
 years old.  The cooking is done by    
 them and it is all fresh including    
 their bread.  I would like to stay    
 there.  All the rooms were polished   
 and attractive, especially the mixture
 of modern and old furniture. It is a  
 very historic place on the site of a  
 Domesday village with a spring which  
 they still use for drinking.  They    
 have an old butter cooler made of     
 stone.  They have 51 acres and they   
 rent it out for grazing.  They        
 puppy-walk guide-dogs, who were       
 excited and friendly and jumped up at 
 us.  They have a bronze medal for     
 puppy-walking.  The owners are very   
 kind and we think it would be a good  
 place for people from a city to stay. </content>
