		<title>05Local Agriculture + Goats!</title>
		<content> The locality does not contain 1st rate
 argicultural land and is mostly used  
 for{dairy farming.}                   
{Godwins Farm}at{Lydiard Green}is a    
 typical small local farm of some 75   
 acres of cultivated grass land on     
 which a herd of{66 Friesians}graze.   
 They produce 278,000 litres per year, 
 this is stored in a cooling tank each 
 day before it is taken to the{Unigate 
{Dairies}at Wootton Bassett.           
 Many people keep{goats,}there being   
 about 30 goats in the area, a mixture 
 of{saanen, toggenburg}and{anglo       
{nubrians.}Most of the owners keep     
 them for their milk, which they can   
 drink or make into butter and cheese  
 or sell. The male{"goatlings"}are     
 slaughtered for meat. For most people 
 the initial attraction of self_       
 sufficiency soon wears off due to the 
 labour intensive nature of this hobby.</content>
