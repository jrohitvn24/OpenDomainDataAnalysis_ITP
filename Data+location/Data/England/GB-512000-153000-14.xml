		<content>{Lt.Bookham Village Hall}was given to  
 the community by Mrs Chrystie, the    
 temperance reformer, and after a      
 period of dilapidation, is now in the 
 care of a youth drama group (Pose).   
                                       
{Fetcham Village Hall}was originally a 
 barn, the main structure being about  
 150 yrs old. In 1933 the 200 residents
 of the village raised money to buy the
 building and convert it into a village
 hall. In the course of the renovation,
 carried out by voluntary labour, chalk
 from the newly opened Mickleham bypass
 (A24) was used in the foundations. The
 adjoining small hut was built as a    
 British Restaurant during World War 2.
                                       
 The Hall is the main public meeting   
 place in the village. The hall is run 
 by a council of management &amp; trustees 
 who are elected from the council.     </content>
