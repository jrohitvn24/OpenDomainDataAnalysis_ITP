		<content> THE VILLAGES OF KENN AND KENNFORD     
 SNUGGLE UNDER THE STEEP ESCARPMENT OF 
 THE HALDON HILLS RISING ABOUT 1KM     
 SOUTH OF THEM. THEY ARE PICTURESQUE   
 VILLAGES WITH A POPULATION OF ABOUT   
 1200 PEOPLE. THEY COME UNDER THE CARE 
 OF TEIGNBRIDGE DISTRICT COUNCIL. THE  
 POPULATION COVERS ALL AGES FROM YOUNG 
 CHILDREN TO RETIRED PEOPLE. MANY OF   
 THE HOUSES ARE BUILT OF DEVON COB AND 
 MANY HAVE THATCHED ROOFS.THE VILLAGES 
 ADJOIN THE MAJOR HIGHWAY THE A38 WHICH
 LINKS TO OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY.  
 THE PEOPLE HAVE MIXED FEELINGS AS TO  
 THE WORTH OF THE ROAD. TO SOME IT     
 BRINGS NOISE AND UNWANTED VISITORS, TO
 OTHERS IT IS A LINK TO ARES OUTSIDE   
 DEVON. THE LEISURE ACTIVITIES OF THE  
 VILLAGERS COVER SPORTS,GARDENING, AND 
 STAMPCOLLECTING. TO SOME THE VILLAGES 
 ARE A RETREAT FROM THE NEARBY CITY OF 
 EXETER.                               </content>
