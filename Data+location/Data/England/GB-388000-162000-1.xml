		<title>01MELKSHAM - AN INTRODUCTION</title>
		<content>   Melksham, a town on the river Avon, 
 is surrounded by unspoilt scenery.  It
 is expanding rapidly due to many new  
 estates and the recent reopening of   
 the railway.  The origin of the town  
 can be traced back to before the      
 Doomsday record, but the only building
 with a trace of this is the parish    
 church.  However, there are still many
 other buildings of interest.  For     
 example the stone houses in Church    
 Street, or the Georgian and Regency   
 houses in Spa Road.                   
   The local government has 12         
 councillors.   The town is divided    
 into 4 Wards; Roundpond, Forest,      
 Lambourne and Town.                   
   Melksham falls into the Westbury    
 constituency of Parliament, and the   
 Wessex European Parliamentary         
 constituency.
