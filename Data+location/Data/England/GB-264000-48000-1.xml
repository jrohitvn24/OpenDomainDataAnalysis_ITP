		<content> This is an area of farmland within the
 coastal hills of Devonshire's south   
 hams.   To the SE of the block is a   
 small concentration of farms and      
 cottages, and the whole is intersected
 by small lanes set within high, grass 
 grown Devon stone hedges.   There are 
 very few trees.   Traditional farming 
 is milk and beef production from S    
 Devon and Friesian Cattle, carried out
 on medium sized, family owned or      
 tenanted units.   Land use, however is
 undergoing rapid change, with the     
 acquisition of larger acreages   by   
 fewer owners.   Traditional pasture   
 fields are being opened up for arable 
 crops, mainly barley, but including   
 wheat, potatoes, rape and turnips.    
 This is inevitably changing the       
 appearance of the countryside as      
 hedges are removed, allowing easier   
 use without its barns and dwellings,  </content>
