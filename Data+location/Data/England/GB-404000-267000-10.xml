		<title>10A Typical Working Mum's Day.</title>
		<content> At 7.15am.{I get up}and make the      
 packed lunches. The family get their  
 own breakfast. I wash dishes, make    
 beds and shower. A short car journey  
 gets us to the{Y.M.C.A.}Community     
 Centre where I work with my husband. I
 see the children to school, then I    
 start. My day varies according to the 
 programme but each morning I oversee  
 the coffee bar; buying and making food
 to be sold, and supervising any       
 volunteers. Some days I have special  
 lunches to prepare. I see people, make
 telephone calls and organise{publicity
 for new clubs or{fund raising}        
 activities. Occasionally I supply     
 teach locally. We return home between 
 5 and 8 o'clock. I make dinner, tidy  
 up, read, write or watch television.  
 Sometimes I go to a meeting or take   
 the children to a club. I fall asleep 
 around midnight.                      </content>
