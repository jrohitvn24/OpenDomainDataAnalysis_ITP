		<title>08THE WATERWORKS AND RESERVOIR</title>
		<content>                                       
     The Waterworks and reservoir are  
 situated at the east end of the       
 village of Castle Carrock.   The      
 project was started in 1905, completed
 in 1908 and in use ever since.   The  
 reservoir holds approx. 180 million   
 gallons of water.                     
     The source of the water is at     
 Geltsdale on the fells 3 miles east of
 the Works.   The water comes from     
 springs in the catchment area and is  
 piped directly into the reservoir from
 where it is filtered, tested, and then
 piped for use to Carlisle and         
 district: 3 million gallons each day  
 being consumed.                       
     Two employees, the foreman and    
 filter attendant, live on the Works   
 and two more travel in each day.      
 Additional labour is brought in when  
 needed.                               </content>
