Darnet fort 807707 is one of two       
guarding the narrow entry to Gillingham
Reach of the river Medway.It is        
situated on the tip of Darnet Ness one 
of the islands which at high tide form 
the Nore marsh. Dating from the        
nineteenth  century it was in use      
from 1872 until the 1900s. The fort is 
round with two floors, the  upper is an
open platform while the lower has a    
series of gunports.Today the fort is a 
popular picnicing spot with the many   
boating enthusiasts which the broad    
Medway estuary attracts. South of the  
island is an anchorage sheltered from  
the easterly breezes which frequently  
in summer give good sailing. The area  
being out of the fierce tidal race of  
of the main channel has safe bathing   
for children with shallow water at all 
states of the tide.                    </content>
