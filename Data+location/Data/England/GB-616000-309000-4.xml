 The former village elementary school  
 is now Saint Augustine's Roman        
 Catholic Primary School.              
 A new school was built on Beaumont    
 Road in the 1930s:  this is now       
 Costessey Infant School.              
 An imposing site overlooking the A47  
 was chosen for Costessey Junior       
 School, in the early 1950s.  At its   
 peak, it had over 500 pupils, but has 
 now stabilised in the 300+ range.     
 The former Secondary Modern School is 
 now Costessey High School, dealing    
 with children aged 11 to 16.  Pupils  
 transfer to the City College or a     
 comprehensive school in the city for  
 Sixth Form.  Costessey is unusual in  
 retaining transfer at 11+ rather than 
 12+ like the city middle schools do.
