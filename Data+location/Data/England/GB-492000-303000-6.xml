		<content> Each summer the school holds a fete.  
 This year we had a Wild West Show.    
 This is an account given by a 7 year  
 old:_"At the Fete I went on the       
 Tombola and won some stuffing. I had a
 strawberry flavoured ice cream with   
 strawberry topping.I had a go on the  
 "Pick a Pocket" game. Children walk   
 around in a costume covered in pockets
 and you pay to take a present from a  
 pocket.                               
 I was a squaw in the Fancy Dress      
 Competition.My friend won first prize 
 in the Infants and my sister won first
 prize in the Juniors. She won a Â£1    
 note."                                
 Other attractions included:_Pony      
 rides, barbecue, various stalls,      
 games, competitions, greasy pole and  
 raffle.                               
 The fete raised Â£555 for school funds.
