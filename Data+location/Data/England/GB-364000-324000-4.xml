 The children turned the school garden 
 into a nature garden complete with    
 pool. Much work had to be done because
 part of the garden was neglected and  
 full of lots of rubbish such as old   
 iron and plastic bags.                
 I am Emma wellings aged 11 and one day
 I went to the nature garden on March  
 20th 1985 and wrote;                  
        {Our nature garden.            
 Looking at our Jumble litter of a     
 garden, I thought in my mind what it  
 would look like if we tried hard.     
 Digging and turning the hard cold     
 litter ground, to be a bright and     
 brilliant place to be, With flowers   
 and trees full of birds  and a fish   
 pond right in the middle. But that is 
 all in the future all we have now is a
 tangle scramble mess.
