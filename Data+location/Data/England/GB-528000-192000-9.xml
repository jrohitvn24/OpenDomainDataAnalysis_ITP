 Sir Anthony Berry was MP for          
 Enfield-Southgate until his tragic    
 death last October from the IRA bomb  
 at Brighton.  His successor is Michael
 Portillo.  The constituency has been  
 controlled by Conservatives for the   
 last 20 years.                        
 The famous tennis player, Jo Durie    
 lives locally.  She has participated  
 at Wimbledon in the past.             
 The writer, Leigh Hunt, was born in   
 Southgate.  He was very fond of its   
 peaceful rural environment.           
 The area has royal connections from   
 its proximity to Enfield Chase which  
 was hunted by kings and nobles for    
 many centuries.
