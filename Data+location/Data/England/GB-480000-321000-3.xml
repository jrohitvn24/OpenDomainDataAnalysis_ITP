		<content> Grass-land is used for three purposes:
 1. Pasture - either for sheep or      
    fattening cattle, or for dairy     
    herds. Being an important hunting  
    area, grazing is also used for     
    horses.                            
 2. Silage - is made from cut grass    
    which after consolidation in a     
    clamp is then covered to keep the  
    air out. It is then common practice
    to weight down the cover with bales
    or old vehicle tyres.              
 3. Hay - like silage is used for      
    animal feed during the winter. The 
    grass is mown and dried in the     
    fields, turning frquently. When    
    dried the hay is baled. As with    
    straw both circular and rectangular
    bales can be made, the latter being
    more labour intensive, both during 
    the baling stage and when required 
    for feeding stock in the fields.   </content>
