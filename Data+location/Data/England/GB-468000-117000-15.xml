		<title>15NAMES AND LANES IN CLANFIELD</title>
		<content> Numerous lanes and footpaths bear old 
 names.Thieves Lane is reputed to      
 have been the lair of highwaymen.Lime 
 Kiln Lane was the track taken by the  
 lime kiln burners of which there were 
 many.No information can be obtained   
 about the footpath leading to  Dead   
 Womans Gate.Cannon Ball Corner,also   
 known as the Warn Cannon Bow has two  
 legends.One that a cart load of cannon
 balls tipped over there and the other 
 a spot reached by a cannon ball fired 
 from Portsmouth.Hogs Lodge (formerly  
 Hog) could be from the celtic HOEG    
 meaning an ancient burial ground or   
 from HOWEN,a general in charge of the 
 nearby Roman camp site.The lanes      
 leading to the view points become     
 congested with visitors at weekends   
 and hazardous in the winter months    
 especially after a snowfall.
