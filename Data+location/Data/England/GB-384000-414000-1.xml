 Norden is a western suburb of Rochdale
 built along the main route from       
 Rochdale to Blackburn and Bury. The   
 first homes grew round textile mills  
 situated in the valleys with their    
 plentiful supplies of water for power 
 and processing, and were built from   
 locally quarried stone. When mills    
 turned to steam power Norden still    
 provided a good site because of nearby
 coal deposits.                        
    Today Norden, Cutgate and Lanehead 
 are largely residential. They are in  
 attracive surroundings close to open  
 countryside and are commuter areas for
 people working in Rochdale, Manchester
 and surrounding towns. There are good 
 facilities such as a post office,     
 library, pubs, shops and bus services.
