 The houses in Nibley are scattered    
 over a large area.There is a large    
 variety of styles and ages from 18th  
 century bow-windowed houses to new    
 estates of council housing in the     
 centre of the village.In Woodmancote  
 there are approximately equal numbers 
 of modern and three-storey 18th       
 century houses.In both areas Cotswold 
 Stone walls predominate in the older  
 of the properties.When they were built
 the stone was cheap and in abundance. 
 It now raises the value of the        
 house.One house in Wodmancote has a   
 wrought iron porch that is listed     
 while the house itself,a fine early   
 18th century building,is not! Present 
 house selling prices are :Â£17OOO for a
 small end terrace; Â£44OOO for a 193O's
 detached house; Â£6OOOO for a larger   
 cottage with 4.5 acres of ground.     </content>
