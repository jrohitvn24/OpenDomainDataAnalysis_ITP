		<content>{Bartley Middle School}is the only     
 school remaining in the area. It      
 became a Middle School in 1974 after  
 having previously been a Secondary    
 School. It caters for children in the 
 8-12 age group. Within the catchment  
 area, there are insufficient pupils,  
 so many are 'bussed' in from          
 Lyndhurst. At present there are 290 on
 roll but numbers are falling.         
    The School is arranged on a        
 semi-open plan system, with all       
 classrooms opening onto a central     
 corridor. In the lower school, class  
 sizes are 30-33 pupils and in the     
 upper school class sizes are about 26.
 As well as the School's 11.5 teaching 
 staff, it has a full time secretary   
 and Caretaker, plus three kitchen     
 staff and six cleaners. From Bartley, 
 the children move to Hounsdown        
 Comprehensive School                  </content>
