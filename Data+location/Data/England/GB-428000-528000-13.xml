		<title>13Children's leisure.</title>
		<content>   Children may join the Boy Scouts or 
 the Girl Guides or the Jazzband.      
   During school playtimes we play the 
 usual games. The boys play football or
 cricket. Sometimes the girls may join 
 in but they may be skipping or playing
 'two-baller'. Tiggy-on-high is popular
 and so is British Bulldog but this can
 become too rough when children are    
 lifted off the ground and is sometimes
 banned at school.                     
   At certain times there may be crazes
 for particular games such as marbles  
 or conkers or collecting football     
 stickers.                             
   We have no amusement arcades with   
 slot machines or 'space invader'      
 machines but the open countryside     
 around us more than makes up for this.
