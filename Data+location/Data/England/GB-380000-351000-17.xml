land is used in quite a few different  
ways.There is a park with many kinds of
trees, a cricket ground, a pavillion   
for the players, four tennis courts,   
bowling greens, and a putting green.   
Clough Hall park is a very enjoyable   
leisure ground.Also there is a         
wood that you could go through, it is  
full   of wildlife and there is a      
little pool. In the wood there are     
squirrels,butterflies,moths            
and many more things. In the pool      
there are tadpoles, frogs   and a few  
toads.In the summer the leisure ground 
attracts many people young and old.    
There is a little stream that you can  
cross to get in and out, but there are 
also gates. Every year, on November    
5th, there is a big bonfire.
