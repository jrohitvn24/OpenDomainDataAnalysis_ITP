		<title>19 STRATFORD MARKET'S FUTURE</title>
		<content>  THE SITE OF A STALL IN THE MARKET    
PLACE COSTS 180 POUNDS PER QUARTER IN  
RENT. MOST OF THE STALLHOLDERS IN THIS 
MARKET HAVE BEEN USING IT FOR 2 to 10  
YEARS,ON AVERAGE. THE GENERAL FEELING  
AMONG STALLHOLDERS IS THAT THERE HAS   
BEEN A STEADY DECREASE IN TRADE OVER   
THE LAST FEW YEARS.EVEN SO,THE MARKET  
IS STILL CONSIDERED TO BE QUITE GOOD.  
IN THEIR OPINION THE RECENT INTRODUCT- 
ION OF THE "CREDIT CARD" HAS BEEN THE  
MAIN CAUSE OF THE DECLINE OF THE       
MARKET. THIS IS BECAUSE PEOPLE FIND IT 
EASIER TO CARRY ROUND A CREDIT CARD    
INSTEAD OF MONEY,AND BECAUSE OF THIS   
PEOPLE TEND TO USE SHOPS WHERE THE     
CREDIT CARD IS ACCEPTABLE CURRENCY.BUT 
AS FAR AS THE GENERAL IMPRESSION OF THE
MARKET GOES THE STALLHOLDERS AGREED    
THAT THEY HAVEN'T SEEN ANY REAL CHANGES
IN IT OVER THE YEARS.
