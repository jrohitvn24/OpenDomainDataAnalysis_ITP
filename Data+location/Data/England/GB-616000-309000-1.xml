		<content> Costessey is an Anglo-Saxon placename,
 coming from Cost's Ey, which means    
 Cost's Island.  It grew up on a piece 
 of land next to the River Wensum      
 surrounded by marshy ground, so no    
 doubt it was an island, or nearly one,
 in those days.                        
                                       
 On the North side of the river is the 
 parish of Hellesdon, where Edmund,    
 King of the East Angles, was martyred,
 so it is not surprising that the      
 village church in Costessey is        
 dedicated to Saint Edmund.            
                                       
 The unusual thing about the name      
 'Costessey' is that it is pronounced  
 'Cossey' by local people, which       
 confuses 'foreigners'.                
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
