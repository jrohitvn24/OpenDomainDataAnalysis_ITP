		<title>04TRANSPORT IN CHARD</title>
		<content> The main road in Chard is the A30     
 which runs from East to West through  
 the centre of town.It is called the   
 High Road from about half way up      
 Snowdon Hill to the top,the lower part
 is called Fore Street.The A358 runs   
 from North to South through the       
 town.                                 
 We wanted to find out how busy these  
 roads were,so we carried out a survey 
 one week in June.As we expected we    
 found that the intersection of the two
 main roads was the busiest place,with 
 over 20 cars a minute.12 cars a minute
 went past the Guildhall on Fore       
 Street.Most of the heavier lorries    
 went to the industrial estate,such as 
 the milk tankers and refrigerated     
 lorries.                              
 Chard lost her railway in the Beeching
 cuts.                                 
                                       </content>
