		<title>13     Rambridge Farm.</title>
		<content> The largest{farm}in the block has its 
 own{cottages}and is chiefly given over
 to arable{crops. }There is some{sheep 
 farming and paddocks for{horses,}and  
 some fields are under vegetable crops.
{ Rambridge Park}still comprises open  
 ground with stately trees and has an  
 air of wealth which still lingers from
 its original planning.                
                                       
 Many livelihoods depended on larger   
 estates such as these and although the
 support has disappeared the evidence  
 of the crafts still remains.          
 Hedgerows no longer layered but still 
 used as boundaries and{thatch}for     
 walling as well as houses are two     
 examples.
