		<title>09SCHOOL SPORTS: FOUR MARKS</title>
		<content> AREA SPORTS DAY:  Area Sports is a    
 sports day when losts of schools race 
 each other.  My friend Vicki and I    
 were in it.  We collected our sports  
 vests and went to our pen, with the   
 people from our school.  There were 9 
 schools altogether.  There were flat  
 races, hurdles, obstacle races,       
 relays, and skipping races as well.   
 Four Marks school won the trophy for  
 the Juniors and Infants.              
      The Area Sports took place at    
 Four Marks school.  It was a very hot 
 day and everyone was sweating.  Some  
 children were allowed to go swimming  
 in the pool at school because it was  
 so hot.  I was reserve for one race   
 because the girl who was to be in it  
 had pulled a muscle in her leg.  I    
 came second in that race.
