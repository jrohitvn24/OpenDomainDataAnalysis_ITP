		<content> This is a thinly populated rural area 
 of Mid-Sussex and because it contains 
 no mass cheap housing and generates   
 little economic activity, the         
 poulation is weighted towards the     
 wealthy and the retired. The overall  
 figure remains stable. The elderly    
 tenants living in tied cottages are a 
 remnant of the old estate system which
 will soon pass as the cottages are    
 usually sold for modernisation on the 
 death of the tenants or the break up  
 of an estate.The large houses are     
 sometimes occupied by families but    
 more often by older people many of    
 whom are newcomers. The nature of     
 these properties demands affluence    
 from their owners but this is rarely  
 based on long term land holding rather
 earnings from city professions or     
 business.                             
                                       </content>
