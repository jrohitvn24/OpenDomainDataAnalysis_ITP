		<title>04Mills on the lower Coquet.</title>
		<content> Until the late 19th.century most      
 farming communities had their own corn
 mills,usually provided by the Lord of 
 the Manor.Between Guyzance and        
 Warkworth,on the River Coquet,there   
 were several water mills and a wind   
 powered mill.There was also a fulling 
 mill at Wark Mill.                    
 The water mills at Morwick and        
 Guyzance were in use from the 13th.   
 century until early this century.     
 Today there is little left of this    
 once thriving industry.The mill race  
 can be seen at Morwick and parts of   
 Guyzance Mill were recently used to   
 help restore Heatherslaw Mill in      
 North Northumberland. The other mills 
 survive in name only eg.Wark Mill.    
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
