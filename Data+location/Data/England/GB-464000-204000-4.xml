		<content>   These are the results of a random   
survey of 54 householders in this area.
   2 to 3 people lived in the majority 
of houses. No house had more than 6    
occupants.                             
   The average age of houses within the
survey was 34 years.The oldest house   
was built over 200 years ago, whilst   
the newest had been completed in the   
last 3 years.                          
   The householders questioned had     
lived in their present house for an    
average of 17 years.The longest any    
householder had lived in their present 
house was 45 years whereas the most    
recent occupant had lived there only a 
matter of weeks.                       
   28% of householders had been brought
up in the village they were presently  
living in.                             
   Less than 10% of the houses did not 
have the use of a car.                 </content>
