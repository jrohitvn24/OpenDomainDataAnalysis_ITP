owner,Mr.Antony Bamford,of J.C.B       
Excavators Ltd.,Rocester. Mr.Bamford   
employs a butler,a nanny,a cook,maids,a
groom and gardeners,somewhat unusual in
this day and age.Instead of travelling 
to work by horse and carriage,however, 
he uses a helicopter.The properties in 
the old village are owned by           
Mr.Bamford. Some are in the process of 
being  renovated."Home Farm" is now a  
stud farm breeding Arabs.The old farm  
house is a British craft shop open

old Smithy has been restored and is of 
historical interest. The tiny village  
shop closed in 1945.                   </content>
