		<content> (TRAVELLING FAIR) ARE OVER BUT SUMMER 
 FAIRS ARE HELD ANNUALLY IN THE LOCAL  
 VILLAGES. THE MOST EXCITING EVENT IN  
 LIVING MEMORY APART FROM THE          
 OCCASIONAL ESCAPED  BULL APPEARS TO   
 HAVE BEEN THE ALMOST ANNUAL "FLOOD"   
 WHICH OCCUCRRED UNTIL 1947. A         
 DESCRIPTION OF THIS CAN BE FOUND ON A 
 LATER PAGE. THE MOST CONTROVERSIAL    
 TOPIC IN RECENT TIMES OCCURRED        
 WHEN THE COUNCIL GREATLY INCREASED THE
 CHARGE FOR THE EMPTYING OF CESSPOOLS. 
 NO MAINS DRAINAGE IN THE AREA ,OBLIGES
 ALL HOUSEHOLDS TO USE THE POOLS. THE  
 SEWAGE TANKERS PULLED BY LOCAL        
 TRACTORS NOW VIE WITH THOSE OF THE    
 COUNCIL ON THE LOCAL ROADS AND        
 LANES.THERE ARE SOME HOUSES TO BE     
 FOUND WHICH HAVE NO WATER SANITATION. 
 THERE IS NO MAINS GAS SUPPLY TO THE   
 AREA BUT SOME PREMISES USE GAS BOTTLES
 OR TANKS TO SUPPLY GAS FOR COOKING    </content>
