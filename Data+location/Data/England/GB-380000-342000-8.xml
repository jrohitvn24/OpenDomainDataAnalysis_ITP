		<title>08ECOLOGY-STREAM SURVEY.</title>
		<content>On Tuesday 4/6/85,Class 4 visited a    
local stream as part of our Domesday   
project. It was a sunnyday.The stream  
was about 2M. wide,the water was a bit 
muddy  and was flowing quite fast. We  
timed how long it took for a tennis    
ball, a ping pong ball, and an empty   
jam jar to float a distance of 10,     
metres in the stream.                  
We measured a profile of the width of  
the stream by measuring how  deep it   
was at 20cm intervals. At its deepest, 
it was only 50cm. There were many      
different plants. Pink Campion, Lady   
smock, Willow Herb, reeds and trees    
like Willow and Alder. Sticklebacks    
were in the stream and swallows        
swooping down to scoop up a drink.
