		<content> I get up and go down stairs for       
 breakfast. Then I'd hear the noise of 
 the{tractors on their days work.Then I
 climb over the fence and up Natasha   
 and Alexia's drive. Their dog would   
 run out of their conservatory barking 
 It makes me gulp a bit and I have to  
 say" Hello Captain".I then knock on   
 the door. Then we go and play poole   
 while Alexia's getting ready.We play  
 around and dare each other to go in   
 the farm yard.At half past one,I am   
 called for my dinner and I hear all   
 the{same familiar sounds,My brother   
 playing his tapes,my mum cooking and  
 my dad typing and I sit down for      
 dinner and about half an hour later   
 I'll go out to play.At 6.oopm I go in 
 for my tea and after tea I watch tv   
 and at 9.00 I go to bed and read.
