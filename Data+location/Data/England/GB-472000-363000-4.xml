		<title>04LANDSCAPE AROUND OSSINGTON.</title>
		<content>    This very{rural}landscape with     
 its many wooded areas is inhabited by 
 various species of{wildlife,}such as  
{rabbits, hares, foxes}and{badgers.}It 
 has a few gently sloping gradients,   
 but is mainly flat, so much so that it
 was the site of{Ossington aerodrome}in
 the{second world war.}The runways have
 almost gone now returning the land to 
 farmland again, but one or two{air    
{raid shelters}still remain.           
    A number of exotic trees are now   
 growing wild, where they used to be   
 enclosed in gardens belonging to the  
 old hall which has since been         
 demolished. There is also part of a   
{Haha}remaining here, this is a{sunken 
{fence bounding the garden.            
    The lake at Ossington is mainly    
 used as a base for wild duck, and a   
 few eels and fish are to be found     
 there.                                </content>
