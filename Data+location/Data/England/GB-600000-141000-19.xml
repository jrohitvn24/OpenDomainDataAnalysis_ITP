		<title>19Newtown Fete, Ashford</title>
		<content>Each year in July, a fete is held on   
Newtown Green.  Usually there are lots 
od games and stalls selling ice-cream  
and hamburgers.  This year there were  
donkey-rides, races, tugs-of-war, and a
fun-castle to bounce on.  There was an 
Aunt Sally, where you throw wet sponges
at a person's face, which is poking    
through a wooden picture.  In the race 
for 9-ll years old, Christian Addy won,
Tommy Dixon was second, Robert Dixon   
was third, and Stephen MacMillan came  
fourth.  All the boys go to East Stour 
C.P. School.                           
   There was a tug-of-war between      
Newtown and South Willesborough which  
the latter won.  There was also a game 
called Splat the Rat.  Someone drops   
a pretend rat down a tube and you have 
to hit where you think the rat is.  The
fete started at ll o'clock and went on 
until tea-time.                        </content>
