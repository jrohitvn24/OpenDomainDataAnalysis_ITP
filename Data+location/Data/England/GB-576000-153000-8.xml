		<title>08SHEPWAY CARE FOR THE ELDERLY</title>
		<content>   The estate now has a far greater    
 proportion of old people compared with
 its original population. A warden     
 makes regular visits and is on        
 emergency call to elderly residents.  
 Coach outings are organised by        
 Cambridge House, an attractive day    
 centre and residential home. A new    
 development of self-contained         
 bungalows and flats with a community  
 lounge and site warden opens soon. The
 W.V.S. provides meals on wheels while 
 St Martin's Church, celebrating its   
 silver anniversary (1985), runs a     
 weekly luncheon club and operates a   
 care scheme. Quarterly meetings are   
 held co-ordinating services for the   
 estate. The Borough Council supplies  
 23 pounds' worth of tokens (1985) for 
 each pensioner's use on local bus     
 routes, and on express train and coach
 services to London.                   </content>
