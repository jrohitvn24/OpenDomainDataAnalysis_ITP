		<title>01UTTOXETER - AN INTRODUCTION</title>
		<content>   Uttoxeter is a small market town    
lying close to the Staffs-Derbyshire   
border,14 miles NE of Stafford.        
   The town has a population of 10,008 
and is mainly associated with its race 
course and the penitence of Dr Samuel  
Johnson who,in the late 18th century,  
stood bareheaded in the rain in        
atonement for his youthful refusal to  
man his father's Market Place          
bookstall.                             
   The town is possessed of good road  
links with its neighbours,the most     
recently completed being the new Stoke 
link road which by-passes many of the  
intermediate villagers,relievingthe    
problems of motorists and villagers    
alike.                                 
   Although Uttoxeter station is       
no longer manned,we still enjoy good   
rail links to Stoke and Derby.
