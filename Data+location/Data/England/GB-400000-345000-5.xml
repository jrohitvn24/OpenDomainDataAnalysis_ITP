		<title>05Dairy Farming round Kingsley</title>
		<content>  Mr Clowes and Mr Fallows are ordinary
dairy farmers. Their working day       
normally starts at 6.30 am when they   
milk the cows. That takes until 9.0 am.
They are both very busy because Mr     
Clowes has 55 cows and Mr Fallows 107. 
After milking they feed the animals.   
Next the farmer has his breakfast.     
  The rest of the day is spent on      
maintenance, cleaning, spreading       
manure, cutting and baling hay or      
spraying against weed. The hay harvest 
is the busiest time of the year.       
Evening milking starts at 4.30 pm,     
and the working day ends at about      
9.0 pm.                                
  Mr Clowes has been a farmer for 16   
years and he bought his 100-acre farm. 
Mr Fallows has 400 acres on two sites  
which he took over from his father     
when he retired.
