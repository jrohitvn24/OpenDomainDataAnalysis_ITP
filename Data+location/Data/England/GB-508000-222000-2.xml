		<content> To the south and east of People's Park
 are rows of Victorian terraced houses.
 There used to be hat factories here   
 and the workers lived in these houses 
 and the factories were between the    
 streets. Now a lot of the area is     
 being redeveloped and light industry  
 has taken the place of the hat        
 factories.                            
 To the north of People's Park and     
 Pope's Meadow there are semi-detached 
 and some detached houses. These were  
 built in the middle of the 20th       
 century. It is a good place to live if
 you want to commute to work in        
 Bedford, Hitchin or Stevenage, or to  
 catch a train to London.
