<title>21Devizes - 2011</title>
<content>Devizes is still very much as it was in 1986 - it still has a healthy weekly market every Thursday, and the twin town scheme still operates. The brewery is still a significant employer in the town, though most people commute out to Bristol and Swindon to work.&lt;br />&lt;br />The hospital at Roundway closed in 1995, replaced by a more modern building nearby. The old hospital was converted into town houses (this article was typed by the author in the building itself!), surrounded by maintained woodland with public access.&lt;br />
