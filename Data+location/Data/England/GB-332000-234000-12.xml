		<title>12LOCAL TRAFFIC</title>
		<content>   The traffic in the area is fairly   
 buisy especially on Market day which  
 is on a Wednesday when farmers take   
 their livestock to market. During the 
 rest on the week it is about average  
 for a rural area. It fairly dangerous 
 for the cars that are passing through 
 the area because of the many sharp    
 bends in the road.The road is called  
 the B4348 and links Hay-On-Wye to     
 Hereford.On the weekend there are more
 coaches taking groups of people to the
 country.During the weekdays there are 
 coaches taking children to and from   
 school. Mostly the traffic is not so  
 buisy during the evening after 8.00pm
