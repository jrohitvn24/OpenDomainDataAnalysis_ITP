<title>21Horsley School</title>
<content>Horsley School now has 115 pupils and 19 staff. There are 4 mixed age classes, the largest one has 34 children in it. In our playground, we have an outdoor classroom, Logworld to play on and an outdoor stage where we perform plays. The nearby church has recently been converted so we can use it in the day as our school hall. Lots of us play musical instruments, and we enjoy all the creative projects we do in lessons. As we have no kitchen, all of us have packed lunches which we eat in our classrooms. &lt;br />
