		<content> In our block there are two villages:  
 Swaffham Bulbeck and Lode with        
 Longmeadow which rise out of flat,rich
 fields.In these arable fields the main
 crops grown are wheat and barley.The  
 villages are quite small.There are    
 about 700 people in Swaffham Bulbeck. 
 In recent years more and more people  
 who commute to Cambridge to work have 
 moved into these farming villages.Life
 is changing and will continue to      
 change. Each village now has one      
 shop/post office,hairdresser,church,  
 chapel and primary school.Lode has    
 recently lost one of its two pubs and 
 is about to lose its school.          
 Running North from the villages are   
 ancient waterways called lodes.Apart  
 from some rising chalk land on the    
 extreme East of our block the raised  
 banks of the lodes are the highest    
 points on the fen landscape.          </content>
