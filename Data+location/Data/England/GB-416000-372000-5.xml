		<content>{STONE CUTTING at CRESSBROOK MILL.}    
 Sand-stone from Stancliffe Quarry     
 arrives at the mill in 5-8 ton blocks.
 There are 2 specialist cutters and 5  
 labourers employed.There are 4 cutting
 machines and 2 splitters.The stone is 
 cut into building blocks and ashlar   
 blocks.Most stone is cut to order and 
 used for both interior and exterior   
 work,60% is used locally,the rest sent
 countrywide.                          
{DRY STONE WALLING }where no mortar is 
 used is a very skilled job.The largest
 stones are used at the base,the middle
 filled with small ones,and coping     
 stones on top keep out the rain and   
 hold the tapered-shaped wall          
 together.A man can build 3-4 metres   
 per day at a cost of Â£5-Â£10 per metre.
 Progress depends upon the size of the 
 limestone available from the nearby   
 fields and quarries.                  </content>
