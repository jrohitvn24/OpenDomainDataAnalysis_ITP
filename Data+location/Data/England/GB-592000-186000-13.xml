		<title>13GT. WAKERINGS COMMUNICATIONS</title>
		<content> THERE ARE TWO MAIN FORMS OF           
 COMMUNICATIONS THEY ARE THE TELEPHONE 
 SYSTEM AND THE LETTER POST.   THE     
 LOCAL TELEPHONE EXCHANGE IS TOTALLY   
 AUTOMATIC AND COMES UNDER THE SOUTHEND
 AREA. THE CODE IS 0702 AND THE GREAT  
 WAKERING NUMBERS START WITH           
 217,218,219 AND THE NEW ONE IS 216.THE
 PUBLIC TELEPHONES OPERATE WITH 10p.   
 COINS BUT MOST OF THEM ARE IN A BAD   
 STATE OF DISREPAIR.   MOST PRIVATE    
 HOMES, SHOPS AND PUBLIC HOUSES HAVE   
 THEIR OWN TELEPHONE.   THE LETTER POST
 IS COLLECTED FROM POST BOXES          
 POSITIONED AT CONVENIENT PLACES       
 THROUGHOUT OUR AREA.  ALL OUR POST    
 BOXES ARE RED SOME ARE ROUND AND SOME 
 OF THE SMALLER ONES ARE SQUARE.  MOST 
 OF THEM HAVE E.R. ON THEM.  THE POST  
 IS COLLECTED FROM THE POST BOXES EVERY
 WEEKDAY AT 9.30 A.M AND 4.30P.M. AND  
 4.45 P.M. ON SATURDAYS.               </content>
