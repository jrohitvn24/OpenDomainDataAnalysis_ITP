		<title>01EDGEFIELD AND AREA</title>
		<content> Edgefield has a population of about   
 400 most of whom live in the village, 
 but some in scattered farms throughout
 the area which is primarily concerned 
 with agriculture. There is one shop,  
 which is also a Post Office,one public
 house and one garage/petrol station.  
 Those who are not employed in the     
 village travel to neighbouring towns  
 to work: Holt,3 miles, Sheringham,6   
 miles, or even Norwich,20 miles. There
 are also  retired people in the       
 village, some who have always lived   
 here, and some who have chosen it as a
 pleasant place for retirement. Houses 
 in the village are mostly of warm red 
 brick, combined with flint. The       
 landscape is varied with woodland,    
 ponds and small streams and hedgerows 
 rich with colour from wild flowers and
 berries.                              
                                       </content>
