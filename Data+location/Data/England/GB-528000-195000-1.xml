  This is an area of contrasts,        
 containing highly residential parts   
 and the open countryside of farmland  
 and recreational space.               
  Since the imposition of the Green    
 Belt,there has been little outward    
 growth in housing.The majorty of homes
 are privately-owned and semi-detached,
 built between the two wars.           
  There is little local industry and   
 many commute into London to find      
 employment.They are well-served for   
 transport with two Underground and    
 British Rail Stations.                
  A few find work at the two hospitals 
 through there are plans for an        
 amalgamation in the 1990's.           
  The area offers a variety of shopping
 facilities and a fair number of       
 educational establishments and        
 religions institutions.               </content>
