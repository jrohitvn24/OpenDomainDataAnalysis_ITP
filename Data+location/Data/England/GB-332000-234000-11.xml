		<title>11GHOSTS OF THE AREA</title>
		<content>   The ghosts of Turnastone and St     
 Margarets are few and far between.    
 Most of the area is shrouded in local 
 superstition which are just stories   
 handed down over the years. Of all the
 ghosts there are a few that have been 
 seen or heard such as the stage-coach 
 which runs past Peterchurch and into  
 Turnastone. The Abbey at Abbey Dore is
 haunted by a monk who was killed for  
 being kindly towards the local people.
 A Roman legion is supposed to march   
 down 'Long Lane' which is why it is so
 straight.
