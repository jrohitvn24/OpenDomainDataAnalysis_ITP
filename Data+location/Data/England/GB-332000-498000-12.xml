		<content> The main summer events are the{Rose   
{Queen Parade}and{Hawkshead Show,}which
 does not include sports but is        
 agriculture and horticulture with a   
 most extensive section of cookery and 
 handicrafts. The 1985 show had so much
 rain that the few spectators were let 
 in free! At most outdoor functions    
 there are{hound trails.}Carefully     
 bred, highly trained and remarkably   
 fed hounds race over an artificially  
 laid trail. Bookmakers are always     
 present on these occasions. There are 
 regular displays of{morris and folk   
{dancing}in the village. In winter     
 evening classes and drama take over,  
 culminating in the{drama festival.    
 Other organizations run eagerly       
 anticipated Christmas parties. At all 
 these events meetings between         
 relatives and friends are as important
 as the actual entertainment.          </content>
