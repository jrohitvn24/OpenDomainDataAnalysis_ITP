		<title>11WALKING</title>
		<content>{The South Downs Way}is a Long Distance
 footpath which runs from Eastbourne to
 the Sussex_Hampshire border. It       
 follows the scarp slope of the Downs  
 from East to West, and walkers enjoy  
 panoramic views of the Weald to the   
 North and extensive vistas of Downland
 and Sea to the South.  The traditional
 Downland scene of green turf, close   
 cropped by sheep is no longer seen    
 because the farmers do not keep sheep.
 The Downs are too accessible to       
 walkers, many of whom bring dogs which
 worry the sheep.  The area is also    
 crossed by a number of tracks running 
 North to South which are rights of    
 way.  Some are pre_historic , others  
 have Roman origins. Walkers are       
 nowadays confined to the tracks as    
 wire fences edge all the cultivated   
 fields.
