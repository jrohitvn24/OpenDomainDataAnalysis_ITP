		<title>09Lord Denbigh.Interview</title>
		<content>{Newnham Paddox}is owned by{Lord       
{Denbigh.}He owns just under 3,000     
 acres of land and most of that is     
 covered by arable crops.Some of it is 
 also covered with rough grazing where 
 the cows eat.Some of the farmers on   
 his land keep sheep. If Lord Denbigh  
 had to move he would move somewhere   
 sunny.Lord Denbigh is very interested 
 in conservation and he is planning to 
 make sure there's enough habitat for  
 birds and to give cover               
 from preditors.                       
  The Denbigh family have been living  
 in the grounds from the year 1400.    
 Lord Denbigh's family have been living
 on the estate for only four years     
 because they used to live in          
 Pailton House near Pailton. In Lord   
 Denbigh's immediate family there are  
 thirty relatives.
