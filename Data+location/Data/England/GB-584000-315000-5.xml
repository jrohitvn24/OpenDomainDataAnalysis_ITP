		<title>05Land Usage</title>
		<content> The land is very heavily used for     
{farming}and this is borne out by      
 statistics.In a count of one hundred  
 areas of land 94 were used for{       
{farming}purposes,one for{recreation   
  and one for deciduous woodland.The   
 type of{farming}carried out is very   
 intensive,one crop replacing another  
 on a strict rotational basis.The      
 fields do not stay bare for any length
 of time.No land is wasted as crops are
 grown right up to the very edge of    
 roads and hedges etc.Because of this  
 there is a need to keep the fields    
 fertilized and a combination of manure
 and artificial fertilizer is used for 
 this purpose.Some of the chemical     
 fertilizer has to be applied by crop  
 spraying aeroplane and this is of     
 special concern for those people      
 connected with the{ecology}of the     
 area.                                 </content>
