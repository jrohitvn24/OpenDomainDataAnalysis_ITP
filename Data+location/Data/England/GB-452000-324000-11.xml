		<title>11THE SOUTH NOTTS.BUS COMPANY</title>
		<content> The South Notts.Bus Company is a small
 concern.It operates between Nottingham
 and Loughborough using one set route. 
 Buses pass regularly through East     
 Leake each hour but more frequently at
 busier times of the day.              
 The service is very popular with local
 people.Its fares are said to be the   
 cheapest in Nottinghamshire,the reason
 being that,with one popular           
 route,good profits can be made whilst 
 charging a reasonable fare.           
 Although most people own cars,a good  
 number of them use the bus to get to  
 work at either Nottingham or          
 Loughborough.                         
 The buses are blue in colour and most 
 of them are old.Breakdowns take place 
 fairly frequently.                    
 South Notts. buses are used to convey 
 children fom outlying villages to the 
 Harry Carlton Comprehensive School.   </content>
