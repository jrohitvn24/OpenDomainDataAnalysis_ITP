		<content> One night, me and my friend went to   
{Wollaton Hall}to interview a man who  
 worked there. We asked him if they had
 ever got to the museum and found      
 anything missing. He said they had not
 had anything missing or they would not
 be doing their job properly.          
                                       
 Then we asked him if he had any       
 strange stories to tell us about the  
 museum. He said, 'Yes. Two of the     
 people that worked there heard someone
 talking. All the doors were locked and
 they went down the stairs, but nobody 
 was there.                            
                                       
 Then we asked him if he had any more  
 stories. He said, 'No'                
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
