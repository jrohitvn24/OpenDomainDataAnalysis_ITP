      People enjoy themselves in many  
different ways in our village. For the 
children there are Cubs,Scouts,Brownies
and Guides,morris dancing and a youth  
club. For the adults there is football,
cricket,bowling,tennis and badminton.  
Each year,the Mawdesley Dramatic       
Society puts on a pantomime and a play.
      The new village hall has provided
many new activities.Indoors people can 
play table-tennis and badminton.       
Outdoors there are four floodlit       
tennis courts.These are all- weather   
courts,so football can also be         
played on them.                        
      We have a good-sized cricket     
ground with a pavilion.In summer,      
matches are played against other       
villages.There is also a good bowling  
green,which is popular in good weather.
