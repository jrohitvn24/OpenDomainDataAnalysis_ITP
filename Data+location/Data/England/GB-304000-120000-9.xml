       There are four churches in our  
 block, at Kittisford, Stawley,        
 Ashbrittle and Greenham. They are     
 all Church of England. Very few people
 go to regular services now. Only one  
 child in our school goes to church    
 every Sunday and he lives in          
 Wellington which, of course, is       
 outside our block.                    
        At Appley there used to be a   
 chapel but it has been turned into a  
 private house.                        
        The four churches in our block 
 have to share one rector, so he is    
 kept very busy. He also comes to      
 Stawley Primary School every Monday   
 morning to join in our morning        
 assembly.
