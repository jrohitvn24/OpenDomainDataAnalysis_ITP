		<content>     People now have much more leisure 
 time. There are more electrical       
 gadgets around the house, mixers, food
 processors, fridge_freezers and       
 microwave ovens mean a meal can be    
 produced quickly. Automatic washers,  
 dryers and dishwashers up dated vacuum
 cleaners mean housework is done more  
 quickly. Men do more in the house to  
 help.                                 
                                       
      In offices photo_copiers,        
 computers and modern robots do the job
 that took several people a long       
 time.Therefore, lots of people work   
 shorter hours or even lose their jobs 
 altogether. This means more sports    
 centres and garden centres are        
 opening like the new one in the       
 Trading Estate at Buywell.
