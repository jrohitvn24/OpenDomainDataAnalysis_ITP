The surgery was built in 1982 to       
replace some very dingy depressing     
rooms where the surgery used to be.    
About 400 patients a week visit the    
surgery. The staff can deal with minor 
accidents. Winter is the busiest time  
of the year because there are more     
accidents then. From 8.30a.m. to 12    
noon is the busiest time of the day    
but the surgery is open until 8p.m.    
each weekday. There are ten rooms, the 
waiting room, dispensary, consulting   
rooms and doctor's rooms. Their oldest 
patient is a lady of 100 years. In the 
future they hope another lady doctor   
will be appointed to the practice as   
Framlingham is a growing town.         
If there are accidents or emergencies  
the ambulance has to be summoned from  
Saxmundham,8 miles away. Patients get  
to Ipswich(19 miles) in about 45 mins. </content>
