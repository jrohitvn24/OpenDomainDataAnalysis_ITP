		<content> The fields around Hawkchurch are      
 mostly grazing fields. There are a lot
 of cattle. The wildlife is mostly     
 nocturnal; animals like badgers,      
 foxes, rabbits, shrews and moles. The 
 houses are very old and most of them  
 have thatched roofs and the building  
 material is not brick but stone.There 
 are a few fields used for grazing     
 sheep and horses.Some farms have      
 poultry. In the village the most      
 important buildings are the           
 post-office, the church, the pub and  
 there is a village cross in memory of 
 the first world war.
