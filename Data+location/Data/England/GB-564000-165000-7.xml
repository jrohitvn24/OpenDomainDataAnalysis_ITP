		<content> The land in the area is mainly used   
 for housing and farming. The people in
 the area are not very wealthy but not 
 very poor. There are no industrial    
 factories so the people are mostly    
 commuters because there is a railway  
 station in Meopham. In the area there 
 are many groups such as Scouts, Cubs, 
 Beavers and Theatrical Groups. There  
 are a couple of groups of shops in the
 area but they are not big stores.     
 Meopham School has three playing      
 fields. There are a number of Schools 
 and petrol stations and there is one  
 park called Camer Park. The weather is
 not bad, but we get a fair amount of  
 rain before the summer. There is also 
 a Footpaths Group who walk regularly  
 and are well organised and lay walks  
 for the public.
