		<content> Contained within the four by three    
 kilometre block are sections of the   
 parishes of Asgarby and Howell,       
 Heckington, Great Hale, Little Hale,  
 and Burton Pedwardine.In the main     
 however the parishes of Heckington and
 Great Hale comprise the majority of   
 the area and these villages and the   
 hamlet of Little Hale mark the        
 boundary of the reclaimed fen land and
 the north to south route along its    
 westernmost edge.This boundary is also
 marked by the ancient Roman canal     
 known for most of its length as the   
 Car Dyke which extends  north towards 
 the Humber estuary and south into     
 Cambridgeshire. The line of the canal 
 is marked by some modern roads and    
 ditches ,  Roman pottery and tiles    
 etc. are regularly unearthed during   
 the everyday agricultural processes.
