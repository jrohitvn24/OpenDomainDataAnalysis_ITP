		<title>12Work &amp; Play at Horton School</title>
		<content> After Assembly we usually do          
 Mathematics or English until playtime.
  Then, the boys play football and     
 cricket and the girls skip or play    
 tig.  We also play on the climbing    
 frame or on the field if it is fine.  
 In winter we bring sledges to play on 
 the field.  In the summer the whole   
 school goes by bus to Wettle for      
 swimming.  As well as lessons like    
 Reading and Music we have some lessons
 on the television and there is also a 
 computer in each classroom.           
                                       
 At Christmas we make cards and sweets 
 to take to the oldest people in Horton
 and Stainforth and do a Nativity Play 
 at the Carol Service in Church. In the
 Summer there is always a concert when 
 the children play recorders and sing  
 or perform a play for the parents.
