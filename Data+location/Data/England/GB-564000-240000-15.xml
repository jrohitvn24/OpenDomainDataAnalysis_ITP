		<title>15Bumpstead Hall.</title>
		<content> The front of the house is 400 years   
 old and the back is 200 years old. It 
 was the hall for Helions Bumpstead.   
 The{Gurteen family}owned it.Then Ian  
 Gemmell and his father in law took    
 over in 1984.The back of the house was
 for servants.They were separated from 
 the rest of the household by green    
 baize doors which still remain. The   
 butler's pantry is near the dining    
 room.{The farm}has 340 acres 131 of   
 wheat,100 of barley,(45 acres for     
 malting) 56 of oilseed rape, 36 acres 
 of linseed, 21 acres of durum.There is
 a pond and a pumping shed for pumping 
 water out of it. There is a combine   
 harvester, a drill and a grain dryer. 
 The barns date back to Tudor times.   
 Now they have to be repaired and it   
 will take Â£ 30,000 to Â£40,000 to do   
 the job.
