		<title>04PUNKS IN ROMSEY</title>
		<content> Most punks became punk for the image, 
 because the clothes were cheaper or   
 for something to do.  One punk said   
 even though he was on the dole he felt
 as if he meant something because he   
 was a punk, not just another statistic
 on a dole chart.  They said that their
 main food was chips, and they ate at  
 odd times rather than at meal times,  
 either at home or on a park bench.    
 They get up quite late, go out about  
 12.30 and come in whenever they want. 
 Their spare time, of which they have a
 lot, is spent hanging around with     
 friends, sometimes playing            
 space-invader machines, with money    
 from dole, social security or         
 sometimes from parents.  Out of 50    
 punks, 47 were unemployed, 44 smoked -
 they withheld information about drugs.
