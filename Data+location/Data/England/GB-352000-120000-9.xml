		<title>09Collecting Postage Stamps</title>
		<content>   I started to{collect stamps}when I  
 was eight.(I am now 11). It all began 
 when I saw some old stamps in a shop  
 window. My mother bought them for me  
 because I would not be quiet about    
 them and it was the only way she could
 get some peace! After that I bought   
 myself some{first day covers}with my  
 holiday spending money instead of     
 buying ice creams. I wanted the stamps
 more than the ice creams!             
   Postage stamps come in all{shapes   
 and{sizes}and in many{colours.}They   
 have all sorts of interesting{pictures
 on them including wild life, natural  
 scenery and famous people and events. 
 You can learn a lot from just looking 
 at stamps!.                           
   Many people collect stamps because  
 they are{cheap to buy.}I mount my     
 stamps in{albums}to keep them safe and
 keep my{swops}in a plastic bag. TECLA </content>
