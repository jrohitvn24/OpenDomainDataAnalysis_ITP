		<content>   I like Jacks. Jacks is a game where 
 you have five jacks and a ball. You   
 put the jacks on the back of your hand
 and throw them to land on your palm.  
 If any fall on the floor you have to  
 pick them up one at a time. When you  
 do it the next time you have to pick  
 them up in two's. You go on until you 
 get up four and then you go on to     
 double bounce. When you have done four
 double bounces you go on to three     
 bounces and then four.                
   Another thing I like doing is       
 playing with my Aunt's kittens. When I
 wave my hand on the floor the kittens 
 jump on my hand and climb on my lap.  
 If you roll a ball it chases after it.
   My best game is playing Dogs with my
 brother Ricky. Ricky is the dog and he
 has races all by himself and when I   
 say he has won he cuddles me and gives
 me a kiss.                            </content>
