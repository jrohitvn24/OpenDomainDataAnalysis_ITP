 1942. At present it has a membership  
 of fifty.The Annual General Meeting is
 held in Calverley Library.            
    They have three plays per season   
 which they perform in the Mechanics   
 Institute. Their plays vary from      
 comedies to serious drama. It is usual
 to hold the plays on four separate    
 nights which is asking for a large    
 commitment in time and energy from an 
 amateur company.

 for adults and 75 pence for children

 full audiences though mainly of local 
 paople.
