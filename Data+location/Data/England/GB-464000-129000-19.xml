		<title>19The Lime Quarry,Ropley.</title>
		<content>                                       
 The lime quarry covers an area of 6   
 acres. 10000 tonnes of chalk are      
 transported from the quarry to an area
 of 30 mile radius &amp; is mainly for     
 spreading on the fields to balance the
 pH of the soil.The pit was opened in  
 1945 and they are now working at a    
 depth of 80 ft.Three JCBs are digging 
 the lumps of chalk which are then     
 taken to an elevator where they are   
 crushed.Huge stacks of powdered chalk 
 are stacked in readiness for the busy 
 season which starts after harvest and 
 lasts until about November.The loader 
 scoops the powdered chalk into the    
 back of the lorry which holds 10      
 tonnes. Then the lorry goes to the    
 farm to spread the chalk over the     
 fields.With a correct pH balance of   
 the soil the farmer gets good crops.  
 It is done every 3-5 years.           </content>
