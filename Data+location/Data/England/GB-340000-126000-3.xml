 Huish Episcopi with my parents and 2  
 sisters. I go to Huish Episcopi       
 C.P.School.On the 10th June 1985 I got

 downstairs, had breakfast and brushed 
 my hair. At 8 o'clock I put my packed 
 lunch in my bag.I set off for school  
 at 8.40.At school I hung up my bag and
 jacket then went into my classroom.At
