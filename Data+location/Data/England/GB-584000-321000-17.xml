		<content> The older people in Weasenham have    
 seen many changes. Many remember the  
 main road A1065 being built which by- 
 passes the villages and leaves the    
 school standing in further isolation. 
 They have seen many new houses built  
 and outsiders moving into the village.
 There was once a bakers,butchers,black
 smiths and 2 grocery shops in ST.Peter
 a post office, general shop and cycle 
 shop in All Saints. Milk was supplied 
 by local farmers. The rectory was liv-
 ed in by the village vicar until 1967.
 Weasenham football and cricket teams  
 were well remembered. The Reading Room
 was used for School cookery classes &amp; 
 Concerts, as well as Dances and Whist 
 Drives but is now closed for public   
 entertainment as it has been declared 
 too great a fire risk. The 2 village  
 public houses are still open.There was
 daily pubic transport till the 1960's.</content>
