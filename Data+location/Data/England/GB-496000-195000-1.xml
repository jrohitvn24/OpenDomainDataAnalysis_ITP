		<title>01GENERAL INFORMATION</title>
		<content> The area we have covered includes     
 Little Chalfont, part of Amersham Old 
 Town,arable farming land, the Harewood
 Downs Golf Course and the privately   
 owned Pollards Wood. The building is  
 largely residential and the population
 professional with above-average       
 educational qualifications. As housing
 is very expensive the proportion of   
 retired and young married people is   
 small. In a typical family the father 
 commutes daily to London, the mother  
 works as a teacher, nurse or secretary
 (if she works) and the children are of
 school age or above. Since access to  
 London is very easy (by both          
 Metropolitan tube and B.R. and the M40
 and M25) and the countryside is green 
 belt, the district is very popular.   
 The educational system is considered  
 good with transfer from middle schools
 as a result of the 12+ examination.   </content>
