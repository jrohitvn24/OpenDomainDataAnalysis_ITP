		<title>16Mr.&amp; Mrs.Hill of Monks Kirby</title>
		<content> Mr. and Mrs. Hill have lived in Monks 
 Kirby since 1964. Mrs Hill thinks the 
 village is not as good as before.     
 Because there are less elderly people 
 and more commuters.They have seen an  
 increase in traffic through the       
 village due to school coaches and the 
 midland red bus service.When Mr.and   
 Mrs.Hill came to Monks Kirby the vicar
 was reverend Fag.They told us King    
 Alfred's daughter Alfreada came to the
 village in the 9th century.Also there 
 was a market of which Henry V11,gave  
 the charter and there was a belltower 
 seperate from the churches on the site
 where the Bell Inn is today probably  
 where it gets it's name from.
