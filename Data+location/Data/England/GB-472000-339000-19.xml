		<content> Aslocktons claim to fame is that      
 Thomas Cranmer, Archbishop of         
 Canterbury in the time of King Henry  
 VIII, Was born here. Local legend     
 tells that he used to sit on a small  
 mound of earth and listen to the      
 church bells in Whatton, And this is  
 why he became a churchman. The mound  
 still exists and is called Cranmers   
 mound. He was famous for getting rid  
 of three of Henry VIII's Wives. He is 
 also remembered for translating a     
 prayerbook into the common language.  
 He was born in a house near the centre
 of the village. Our school is named   
 after him and the local group of      
 churches is called the Cranmer group.
