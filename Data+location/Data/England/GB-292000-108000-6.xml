		<title>06ASHLEY REFUSE TIP</title>
		<content> The{domestic refuse tip}at{Ashley}near
{Tiverton}was opened by{Devon County   
{Council}in 1975 and covers an area of 
 8 acres of leased land. It serves the 
 town of Tiverton and roughly a 10 mile
 radius. From April 1985 the site will 
 no longer be used for depositing      
 refuse and the land will be reinstated
 using surplus soil from the Eastern   
 Distributor Road. It will subsequently
 be grassed and returned to the owner  
 as agricultural grazing land. For     
 about one more year Devon County      
 Council will use it as a refuse       
 collecting centre before transferring 
 this to the{Punch Bowl site}near      
{Crediton.}When a large enough fleet of
 transport vehicles is available the   
 refuse will go direct to{Sutton near  
{Honiton.
