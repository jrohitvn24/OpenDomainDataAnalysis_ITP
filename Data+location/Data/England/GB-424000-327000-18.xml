		<title>18PLAYGROUND GAMES</title>
		<content> Many of the games that we play in the 
 school playground are played in small 
 groups. Often we invent our own games 
 but frequently base them on television
 programmes and films, such as         
 Wonderwoman.                          
 Another favourite of ours is to invent
 space games. We are still fond of     
 running games and either play 'tig' or
 kiss-chase. We also organise our own  
 races across the yard and are quite   
 determined to win. It is an honour to 
 be known as the fastest runner.       
 Sometimes we just stand and watch the 
 others.
