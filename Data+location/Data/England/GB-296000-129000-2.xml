		<content> Buildings                             
 Some of the cottages are now used as  
 retirement homes or holiday cottages. 
 There is one large rectory in the area
 near Rainsbury farm but the church    
 that it served is now derelict.       
 The ruined church of St. James is     
 looked after by the "Redundant        
 Churches Fund". It seems as though it 
 only served the immediate area since  
 it is very small, the nave being only 
 about seven metres long.              
 The area is mainly high ground,       
 Wimbleball lake being at an           
 altitude of about 200m, the land      
 rising to over 300m in the east of the
 area.                                 
 It is an area of great natural beauty,
 the steep banks at the side of the    
 roads being covered with foxgloves    
 when we were there in the summer.
