		<title>15Horses in Horsted</title>
		<content>     Our village is a very horsey place
 because lots of people own and ride   
 horses. My friend Helen owns her own  
 pony and I know six people who ride.  
                                       
     There is a riding stable called   
 Tremains and they have about thirty   
 horses. They have a covered school and
 an out_door school, with about 6 acres
 of land.                              
     There are plenty of bridle paths  
 around, like the one down Wyatt's Lane
 and the one to Broadhurst Manor. Horse
 riders and walkers are allowed to use 
 them.                                 
     The village is called Horsted     
 Keynes so it is partly named after    
 horses. In the past the name Horsted  
 was spelt Horstede, pronounced        
 Horsteed: it meant a place to keep    
 horses.
