		<title>02SHOPPING IN S.E.LUTON(1)</title>
		<content> The main shops in Luton are in The    
 Arndale Centre.Very often people go   
 there in cars and there is a car park 
 which holds 2300 cars.                
                                       
 The"Arndale"(as everybody calls       
 it)looks very,very new as if it has   
 just been built.When you go into the  
 Centre it seems like a completely     
 different world because it is so      
 tidy.It is always busy.In the summer  
 air conditioning keeps you cool but in
 the winter central heating keeps you  
 warm.You can rest in the seats that   
 are there or have a cup of tea or     
 coffee.There are lots of cafes or you 
 can go to your bank.                  
                                       
 It is great when I meet my friend     
 in Debenhams because we keep hiding   
 from our mums.Then we go back home to 
 play.                                 </content>
