		<title>10TRANSPORT IN DONCASTER</title>
		<content> LOCAL PEOPLE TRAVEL BY CAR,BUS,TRAIN, 
 MOTOR-BIKE,BICYCLE OR THEY WALK.THERE 
 IS NO LOCAL MAIN AIRPORT.THE MOST     
 EXPENSIVE TRANSPORT IS A TAXI WHICH   
 COSTS ABOUT A POUND A MILE.TRAINS FOR 
 LONG DISTANCE ARE VERY EXPENSIVE BUT  
 THERE IS A GOOD SERVICE FROM DONCASTER
 AND THEY ARE QUICK.IT TAKES 1 HOUR 45 
 MINS. TO LONDON ON A FAST TRAIN.      
 BUSES IN DONCASTER ARE VERY CHEAP     
 COMPARED TO OTHER TOWNS.A RIDE INTO   
 TOWN COSTS 5P OR 10P FOR AN ADULT, 2P 
 FOR A CHILD.THE SAME DISTANCE COULD   
 COST UP TO 50P ELSEWHERE.THIS IS      
 BECAUSE THE PRICES ARE SUBSIDISED BY  
 THE LOCAL RATES.EVEN JOURNEYS TO      
 SHEFFIELD AND BRADFORD ARE VERY       
 CHEAP.THE MOST POPULAR BICYCLE AT THE 
 MOMENT WITH YOUNG PEOPLE IS THE B.M.X 
 AND CHILDREN PERFORM TRICKS ON THIS.
