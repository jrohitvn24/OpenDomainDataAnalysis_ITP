 the junction of North Street, West

 commuting. On Thursdays and Saturdays 
 there is a{street market. }           
   The{Town Hall} with its clock       
 dominates the crossing and the Court  
 Sessions are held within. There are   
 three{public houses;}the 19thC. Nag's 
 Head, the Angel Hotel-an old coaching 
 house and the oldest hotel in Bourne  
 and The Burghley Arms, birthplace of  
 William Cecil, Lord Burghley.         
   All four main banks are to be found 
 in the Market Place.                  
   The{Corn Exchange}is used as a      
 public hall and the meeting place for 
 the local Chamber of Trade. Outside, a
 shield bears the Bourne Coat of Arms. </content>
