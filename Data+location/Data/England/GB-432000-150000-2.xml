		<title>02CHRIST CHURCH HATHERDEN</title>
		<content> This church, the first in Hatherden,  
 was built in 1857 as a Chapel of Ease 
 to Smannell. In 1873, however, it was 
 made a parish church in its own right.
 In the early morning of July 8th, 1975
 it was struck by lightning and        
 completely gutted by fire. After much 
 prayer and discussion it was decided  
 to rebuild the interior on modern     
 lines, incorporating a Narthex for    
 meetings but retaining the old brick  
 and flint walls.The work was begun on 
 July 8th, 1976, (a year to the day    
 after the fire), and completed in     
 February 1977. The rebuilt church was 
 dedicated by the Rt. Rev. John Taylor,
 Bishop of Winchester, on Sunday,      
 February 20th, 1977.
