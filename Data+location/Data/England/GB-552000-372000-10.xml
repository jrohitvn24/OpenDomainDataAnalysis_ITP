		<content> Chapel St Leonards is not a very big  
 place.There is a few shops,arcades,a  
 church and a fairground and a green.  
 On the green they have a brass band   
 every year.The band is Spilsby brass  
 band.Mr Emerson the vicar aranges a   
 fancy dress.The winner gets a pound   
 and the losers get 10p.Usually they   
 have stalls at this fancy dress.Last

 jokes.There are raffle prizes,stalls  
 selling lacy things.Mr Emerson has a  
 coffee evening at his house aswell    
 where you can get coffee and toys.At
