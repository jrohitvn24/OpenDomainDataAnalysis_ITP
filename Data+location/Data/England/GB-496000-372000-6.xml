 This was established in 1969 to show  
 the domestic agricultural and social  
 life of the county over the last 200  
 years.  The Museum is housed in the   
 Old Barracks which was built in 1857  
 for the Loyal North Lincoln Militia   
 and later became the Headquarters of  
 the Lincolnshire Yeomanry.  The       
 collection put together by members of 
 the Lincolnshire Local History Society
 formed the nucleus of the museum which
 was set up in the gatehouse of the Old
 Barracks in Burton Road.  Since that  
 time the collection had increased in  
 size so quickly that the museum had to
 be made larger.
