		<title>16THE LOCAL POLICEMAN</title>
		<content> The closest police station is at Looe,
 which has got cells in it.The         
 policeman's duty is to go to          
 accidents,talk to old people to make  
 sure they are alright,to check on     
 people and help people who have been  
 threatened by outsiders.He always     
 looks out for speeding cars and motor 
 bikes.He keeps an eye on children     
 playing football in the road or riding
 two on a bike,because it is very      
 dangerous.He warns us not to steal or 
 leave litter around or vandalise phone
 boxes or smash windows.He also warned 
 us not to go with strangers,or to     
 accept sweets from them.
