		<title>04The Villages - Fingest.</title>
		<content>  The four villages are different in   
character and size. The majority of the
older houses are flint faced, typical  
of chalk land building. The three in   
the valley are very old settlements.   
The Romans almost certainly settled    
there and there is strong evidence of  
Saxon occupation.                      
  The beauty of the countryside, the   
quietness, the network of footpaths,   
and the historic churches in the area  
attract thousands of visitors each     
year.                                  
 FINGEST is the smallest with about    
thirty houses clustered near the       
church. The name has changed through   
the centuries -Thengest - Tingehurst - 
Â£at the hanging wood'. Hanger Wood over
looks the village today.               
 The 13th. century St. Bartholomew's   
Church, built of flint has a unique    
double gabled tower.                   </content>
