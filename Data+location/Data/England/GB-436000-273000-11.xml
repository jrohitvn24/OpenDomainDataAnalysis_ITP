  My busiest day is Thursday. At 7:15 I
 get up and have a wash. I have cereal 
 for breakfast then I get dressed. I   
 get my swimming bag ready. At 8:40 I  
 say goodbye to my mum and help to push
 Mrs Timm's baby up to school. We      
 arrive in the playground at 8:50.At   
 9:05 the bell rings and we go into    
 school. At 9:15 we go to Assembly,    
 then we have hymn practice. We go back
 to our classroom to work. We have     
 dinner at 12:00, sometimes it is very 
 nice. We start work again at 1:00.    
 Then at 2:30 we go swimming. We have  
 to go to Ryton Police College to swim.
 We get back to school at 3:30, then I 
 walk home. I have my tea then I go to 
 my nan's until 6:30. I brush my dog   
 then I brush my teeth and go to bed at
 8:00. goodnight. {Lyndsey (age 7).    </content>
