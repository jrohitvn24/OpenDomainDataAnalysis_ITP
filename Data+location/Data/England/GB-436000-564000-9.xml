		<title>09SOUTH TYNESIDE COLLEGE</title>
		<content> In the middle of the 19th century     
 Doctor Thomas Winterbottom sailed to  
 and forth from Africa. There was often
 trouble on these voyages,so when      
 Doctor Winterbottom retired to South  
 Shields he set up a marine school with
 some of his own money.This school was 
 the first in the world and it became  
 world famous. Around 1950 Doctor      
 Winterbottom's money began to run     
 out,so the local authority bought the 
 school.At Westoe Village there was a  
 pig farm called Colleys. This farm was
 the site for the new Marine Technical 
 College as it was called then.The Duke
 of Edinburgh opened it in 1954.Today  
 there are 6000 students who come from 
 all over the world.The college has    
 nine depts.and is open 5 days weekly. 
 In 1984 the college merged with       
 Hebburn Technical College and was     
 renamed South Tyneside College.       </content>
