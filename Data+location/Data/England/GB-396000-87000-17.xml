		<content>   The path emerges into a sandy beach,
 and a developing sand spit can be     
 seen. This is being colonised by small
 plants.The sand is a dry and unstable 
 soil and the plants have long roots to
 reach moisture.Trampling by visitors  
 has destroyed the vegetation and the  
 neck of the spit,but further along,sea
 couch grass and sea lyme grass have   
 stabilised the ridge crest.           
   The cliffs at the back of the beach 
 are composed of Bagshot sands and     
 acidic gravels,which are easily       
 leached,and therefore poor for        
 agriculture.The cliffs are being      
 slowly eroded by wind and rain,and    
 mass movement ie, slumps and slides,is
 common.Offshore black-headed and      
 herring gulls,cormorants and oyster   
 catchers can be seen on the wing,and  
 also settling on the shores of Long   
 and Round Islands.                    </content>
