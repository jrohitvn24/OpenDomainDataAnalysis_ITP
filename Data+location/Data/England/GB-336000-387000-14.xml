		<title>14Admiral St. Traffic Survey</title>
		<content> On the 5th June we conducted a traffic
 survey on Admiral Street.             
                                       
 We started  our  survey  at 10 o'clock
 and finished  at half past ten. During
 this time we saw 186 cars, 44 vans, 18
 wagons,  23 taxis,  6 motor  bikes, 10
 buses, 10 bicycles and 1 tractor using
 Admiral  Street. This  was a total  of
 298 vehicles in  thirty  minutes using
 Admiral Street. We then calulated that
 the  average  hourly total of vehicles
 using  Admiral Street would be 596.   
                                       
 We decided  that with this  amount  of
 traffic  using  Admiral Street  during
 the day that there was a good case for
 a  zebra crossing  being  provided  to
 help  pedestrians get  across  Admiral
 Street.                               
                                       
                                       </content>
