		<content> Fifty years or more ago many{houses}in
 the area had no inside toilet.Therewas
 no electricity and all they had for   
 light was a paraffin lamp.There was no
 hot water tap and all the hot water   
 had to be heated over the fire. If    
 they wanted to heat a lot of water    
 then they would boil it in a tank     
 beside the fire.                      
{Children}went to the secondary school 
 in Aberfeldy by train.The train left  
 at 7.30.The railway was built in 1865.
 It carried wood,coal,livestock and    
 potatoes.People were also carried.The 
 three men who worked at Grandtully    
 Station were the porter,clerk and the 
 station master.                       
{Fishing}on the River Tay in those days
 was excellent. It was so good that any
 good angler could get a salmon        
 weighing about 20lb at any time he    
 wanted. &lt;continued>                   </content>
