		<title>19HOW THINGS HAVE CHANGED</title>
		<content> Many things have changed in 60 years. 
 Small mining villages wre slow to     
 emerge into the 20th century.In 1925  
 earth closets,oil lamps,candles,coal  
 for heating and cooking,no running    
 water and unlit streets were all      
 normal.Life was hard mining provided  
 the only jobs and every day men walked
 the three miles to work.The only other
 transport in Hesleden was the railway 
 now gone.The pits brought electricity 
 to the area but the current was'nt    
 strong enough for cookers and washers.
 War brought great changes for women   
 who had done war work were reluctant  
 to go back to household tasks and so  
 they took jobs.This meant more labour 
 saving devices were  gave more        
 money to the community and            
 Nationalisation gave more money to the
 community and made possible holidays, 
 television and th car.                </content>
