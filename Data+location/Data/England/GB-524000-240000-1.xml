		<title>01COUNTRYSIDE NORTH OF ASHWELL</title>
		<content>  The area is north and west of the    
 village of Ashwell. A few residential 
 houses are included in the block but  
 it is mainly open farmland and farm   
 buildings. The fields are mostly      
 arable although there is pasture for a
 dairy herd. There are various small   
 roads, many retain their hedges though
 the elm trees have gone.Recently many 
 new trees have been planted. One road,
 leading to a derelict bridge, has     
 fallen into disuse. It is a footpath  
 and a county boundary. The river Rhee,
 a tributary of the Cam, rises just    
 south of the area and forks northwards
 through the centre of it. There are   
 two large houses, Ashwell End and     
 Elbrook House, as well as old farm    
 houses and cottages which are now     
 not occupied by farming families. A   
 cemetary, a corner of a recreation    
 ground and factory yard are included. </content>
