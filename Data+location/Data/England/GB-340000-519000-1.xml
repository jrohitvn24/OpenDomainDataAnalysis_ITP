		<title>01Ullswater and Howtown</title>
		<content> A large percentage of the area is     
 covered by Ullswater now a watersports
 centre excepting water skiing which is
 prohibited by a recent local by-law in
 response to pressure from             
 environmentalists to reduce the noise 
 level. The Outward Bound School and   
 Howtown Outdoor Education Centre are  
 well positioned to take advantage of  
 both mountain and water environments. 
 The population is sparse consisting of
 local residents and second home       
 owners. The latter tend to falsely    
 inflate the price of property to the  
 exclusion of young local people who   
 are then forced to leave the locality.
 The local residents are employed in   
 the main either in agriculture        
 including hill farming (sheep) and    
 conservation, or providing for the    
 large influx of tourists particularly 
 during the summer months.             </content>
