		<content>      Along the shore line is part of  
 the Solent Way. This is a major       
 leisure footpath which follows the    
 eastern 61 miles of Hampshire's       
 interesting coastline, from           
 Milford-on-Sea in the west to Emsworth
 at the eastern border with West       
 Sussex. Along the Gosport coastline   
 the route clings to the beach from    
 Lee-on-Solent to Gilkicker Point and  
 is waymarked with distinctive blue    
 signposts.                            
      A matter of few yards from the   
 beach at Stokes Bay is Stanley Park   
 creating an entirely different world  
 with its slender trees and ornamental 
 gardens.                              
      The Alverbank Hotel provides food
 and accomodation on the edge of       
 Stanley Park and there are several ice
 cream kiosks which are only open in   
 the summer season.                    </content>
