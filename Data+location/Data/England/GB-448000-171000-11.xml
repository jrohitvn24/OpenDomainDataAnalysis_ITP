		<title>11HERMITAGE SCHOOL HALL</title>
		<content>   There have been vague plans to build
 a hall for many years. The Parish     
 Council decided to commit money to the
 project with the object of the        
 completed hall being available for    
 parish use outside school hours,      
 compensating for the lack of          
 alternative sporting facilities in the
 village. The Parish Council, by       
 increasing the local rate, will       
 contribute just over Â£20,000 towards a
 project which has cost some Â£90,000.  
   School activities in the hall will  
 include assembly, PE and games, drama 
 and movement, concerts and plays,     
 parents' meetings and PTA events.     
   The Parish Council expect local     
 groups to use the hall for badminton, 
 keep fit, basket ball, cricket,       
 netball, softball, etc.
