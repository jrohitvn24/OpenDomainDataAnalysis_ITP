		<title>16ST WULSTANS HOSPITAL MALVERN</title>
		<content> The 65 single storey buildings        
 covering 88 acres were an army camp.  
 In 1950 they became a{National Health 
{Service hospital}for tuberculosis. In 
 1961 they changed to treating{mental  
{illness}for which St Wulstan's became 
 nationally famous. With 93 in-patients
 45 out-patients and 150 staff it is   
 running at about half capacity because
 it is gradually{closing down.}The site
 is peaceful but remote, the buildings 
 are{deteriorating}and it is considered
 desirable for patients to be in       
 hostels in the{community}rather than  
 in one specialised unit. Many patients
 have been there since 1961. Most can  
 leave if they wish unless they might  
 endanger their own lives or someone   
 else. To encourage a{normal working   
{life}they are paid for working in the 
 gardens, offices, kitchens, laundry or
 workshops making plastic bags, fences.</content>
