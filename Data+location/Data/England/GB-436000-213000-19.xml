		<title>19Leisure Time</title>
		<content>I am going to write about what people  
do in their leisure time.Nowadays      
people have more leisure time than they
used to.This is because some people    
have no jobs or some people may work   
part time.My mum works part time in a  
dentist. She cannot work full time     
because she has to look after me. In   
their leisure time people may swim or  
walk their dogs. North Leigh is out in 
the country side, so you have to go a  
long way to go to Witney sports        
centre.My mum plays squash and swims   
in her leisure time. My friend's       
mum works. She has no spare time       
except weekends.When it is hot, she    
sun-bathes and swims.Her dad works but 
is home 4.00 so he normally falls      
asleep or works in the garden. He      
sometimes plays football on Saturday.
