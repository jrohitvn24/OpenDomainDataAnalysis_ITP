		<title>16Getting up in the morning P1</title>
		<content>  I half wake up and open the curtains.
 An instinct tells me that the house   
 isn't properly alive. By this time i'm
 fully awake. Now I play golf with an  
 old cricket bat, a tennis ball and a  
 table leg as the hole. I go into Mum  
 and Dads room. Mum is lying in bed    
 awake. I'm tired and instead of going 
 back to my bed I go into Mums and Dads
 double bed because it is more comfy.  
 Dad is downstairs washing up the      
 coffee mugs. I went downstairs and got
 a breakfast of start breakfast cereal.
 Mum came downstairs. I droped a little
 bitnofnstart andbasked the dog if she 
 wanted any. Mum said Jenny had been at
 a meat pie and two bins in the night. 
 I decided not to give Jenny the Start 
 as she was naughty. After finishing   
 breakfast I got dressed. Mum went on a
 walk with the dog and by the time she 
 was back I was ready.                 </content>
