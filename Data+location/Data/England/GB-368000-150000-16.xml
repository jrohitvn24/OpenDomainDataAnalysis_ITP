		<title>16ARTS AND CRAFT IN KILMERSDON</title>
		<content> Several who seek to make a living from
 their artistic skills have found a    
 home in the Kilmersdon area. One group
 share a workshop converted from old   
 farm buildings where they do          
 wrought-iron work, strip furniture and
 make it. The disused Methodist chapel 
 has been utilised by a Stone Mason    
 specialising in large sculptures. He  
 has helped in the restoration work at 
 Wells Cathedral. The couple who run   
 the Herb Farm have a craft shop where 
 they sell anything made to a high     
 enough standard - knitwear, clothing, 
 pottery, woodwork, basket-weaving and 
 honey. Like other communities, there  
 are many gifted amateurs of craft and 
 skills encouraged by the W.I. These   
 include flower-arranging, homecrafts, 
 lace-work, handicrafts in general and 
 photography. An exhibition is held in 
 the courtroom to sell their wares.    </content>
