		<content> The{flowers}which grow best in this   
 area are lime loving ones like        
 Snapdragon (Antirrhinum),Nasturtiums, 
 Lupins and wild Cowslips. In summer   
 the{salty atmosphere}keeps the air    
 damp and levels the temperature so    
 plants grow well. In winter it keeps  
 the frost away so that tender plants  
 can be grown. High winds and soil     
 containing salt burns the leaves of   
 plants. In winter crops such as sugar 
 beet like a high salt level in the    
 soil. Mainly hardy types of{trees and 
{shrubs}grow well. Some of the more    
 unusual ones are Mimosa, Eucalyptus,  
 Senecios and Hebes. The Hebes are a   
 family of shrubs from New Zealand and 
 are too tender to grow well away from 
 the coast. They are all evergreen and 
 range in size from a few centimetres  
 to three metres or more.
