		<content> In the peace and quiet of Crocks      
 Bottom roe deer live out their lives  
 while pheasants call and squirrels    
 jump between the trees.  The buzzard  
 circles far overhead while voles,     
 field mice, weasels and stoats scurry 
 amongst the undergrowth.  Badgers     
 wander the countryside at night along 
 with their spikey neighbours the      
 hedgehogs, while bats, dark shapes    
 against the night sky, go foraging.   
 The owl goes about his errie business.
 The fox can be seen making his way    
 through the hedges and across fields  
 startling rabbits and birds as he     
 goes. During the day magpies chatter  
 as they search for food for their     
 fledglings and blackbirds, robins,    
 finches and watails flit between the  
 hederows feeding on the berries of    
 autumnal abundance.
