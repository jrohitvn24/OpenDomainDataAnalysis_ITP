      The main activity in this area is
 Dairy and Sheep farming with some land
 being used to grow hay and straw.     
 Some of the land is cultivated but    
 most is left as rough pasture for the 
 animals to graze in.                  
                                       
      All of the fields are divided up 
 using ditches and hedges _ there are  
 no stone walls as seen around other   
 parts of Gloucestershire _ and all    
 are well served by drainage ditches.  
                                       
     Ten seperate farms were counted in
 this area.                            
                                       
     There are a few scattered houses  
 in the area - most of which occur in  
 the small villages of Bevington, Hill 
 and Upper Hill - none of which        
 contains more than 6 houses.          </content>
