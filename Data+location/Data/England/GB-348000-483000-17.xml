		<title>17THE VILLAGE SHOP</title>
		<content> The local shop is opposite Heversham  
 Church.  It is run by Mr. and Mrs.    
 Shuttleworth.  They have lived there  
 for 23 years and run a post office    
 which has been open for five and a    
 half years.  The shop averages 70 -   
 l00 customers every day.  They like   
 living in the area and like the       
 customers very much.  The building is 
 200 years old and today it is fitted  
 out as a general grocery store which  
 goes a long way to meet the needs of  
 the local population.  They keep a    
 wide range of stock which includes not
 only frozen and fresh food stuff but  
 general stock ranging from greetings  
 cards to items of hardware.  They sell
 sweets and tobacco, have daily        
 deliveries of fresh bread and milk and
 with the shop being in the centre of  
 the village, it provides notices of   
 general interest and acts as a centre </content>
