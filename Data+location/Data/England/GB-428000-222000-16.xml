		<title>16WORK AND TRADE IN CHURCHILL</title>
		<content>  Churchill does not possess an        
 industrial site, but there are several
 small businesses within the area.     
 Mount Farm is converting farm         
 buildings for use by one-man operated 
 trades and crafts such as woodworking,
 pottery, etc.:  in 1985 this is still 
 in its early stages.   Established    
 commercial enterprises employing staff
 are automobile engineers, a building  
 contractor, an equestrian school, a   
 public house and the farms.   There   
 are many self-employed people         
 including a landscape gardener, window
 cleaner, potter, private car hire and 
 courier, general engineer, road       
 haulier, agricultural contractor,     
 carpenter, picture framer and two     
 blacksmiths. Some teachers and school 
 helpers work locally, and there is a  
 paid part-time Parish Clerk.   Few    
 people are unemployed.                </content>
