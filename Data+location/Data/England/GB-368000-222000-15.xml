 land use in this block,with{apples}as 
 the main crop.There are four extensive
 orchards where the fruit produced is  
 sold commercially. Examples of the    
 fruit grown are Cox's Orange Pippin,  
 Worcester and Bramley. The Grade 1    
 apples are marketed at Birmingham,    
 Bristol, and Cardiff or are bought by 
 co-operatives for distribution to     
 supermarkets around the country. The  
 smaller fruit is sold for{cider making
  However, there are still many true   
{cider apple trees,}especially in{Aston
{Ingham}together with some{cider pears.
 Some fruit also goes to the jam       
 factories.  Most of the farms and     
 cottages have apple,plum and pear     
 trees and sell the fruit from the     
 door.  Soft fruits are grown as a     
 secondary crop. Top quality fruit goes
 to hotel trade.                       </content>
