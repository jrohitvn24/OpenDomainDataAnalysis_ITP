		<content>   Near Mucking is the largest working 
 sand and gravel quarry in S.E.Essex.  
 It is owned by Cory Sand and Ballast  
 Co. and covers over 1,000 acres.      
 Materials from this site have been    
 widely used in the construction       
 industry eg. M 25, A 13 and house     
 building.The old workings have either 
 been conserved or are being restored. 
   The Warren consists of 3 waterfilled
 pits which are relics of former       
 workings.Shell U.K. maintains the two 
 largest as a recreational amenity for 
 its refinery workers.Fishing is very  
 popular at this site.                 
   Around Mucking Creek, nearby, is a  
 Nature Reserve, run by the Essex      
 Naturalist Trust, where rare birds can
 be seen.                              
   At the jetty on Mucking Flats,      
 refuse from London arrives in sealed  
 containers to be used for landfill.   </content>
