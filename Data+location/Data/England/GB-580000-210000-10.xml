		<content> Sandford's quarry comprises a number  
 of gravel extraction works. One is    
 privately owned, and the majority is  
 worked by Redland Aggregates. Their   
 total holding was 109 acres. All but  
 40 acres are now exhausted. The       
 remaining gravel deposits are expected
 to last until 1989. These lie 14ft.   
 below ground level, and the strata are
 about 15ft. thick. 165000 tons are    
 extracted annually. There are 9 people
 employed, most of whom worked         
 previously on local farms. The eight  
 lorry drivers are self-employed. When 
 the area is worked out, it is returned
 to agriculture, and has a high degree 
 of fertility. Two lakes 4 acres in    
 extent have been formed, trees have   
 been planted around and fishing is    
 available for local people.
