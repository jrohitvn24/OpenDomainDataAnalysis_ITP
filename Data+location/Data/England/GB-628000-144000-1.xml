		<title>01Whitfield Village</title>
		<content>The village of Whitfield is situated   
approximately 4km from the port of     
Dover, 21km from Canterbury, 28km from 
Thanet, 1.5hours driving time from     
London and 2 hours from Calais.        
The population in 1801 was 164 and rose
to 4923 by 1981 but we are sure that   
the figures have grown since then as   
many more houses have been built.      
In character, Whitfield consists of a  
series of housing estates that have    
been built outwards from both sides of 
the main road (A256) extending into    
agricultural land.                     
The village has many amenities, the    
most important being the village hall, 
post office, paper shop, old people's  
homes, guide hut and the primary       
school. We also have a police and fire 
station.                               
The farms have mostly arable land.
