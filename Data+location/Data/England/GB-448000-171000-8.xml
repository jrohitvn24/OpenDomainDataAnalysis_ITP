		<title>08HERMITAGE SCHOOL FETE</title>
		<content> The Parent Teacher Association        
 organizes a fete at the school every  
 year. The PTA is an association where 
 parents and teachers join together to 
 raise money to buy things for the     
 school. A fete is when lots of people 
 come to enjoy themselves and look at  
 the displays and stalls, and buy      
 things like plants, books and games.  
 There is a rainbow stall which        
 contains lots of different coloured   
 items. A tombola is where you can win 
 bottles of drink and cans of food.    
 There is also a refreshment tent where
 you can go and buy drinks, cakes and  
 ice-creams. One of the main           
 attractions is the aerial ropeway. You
 shoot down a rope which is supported  
 by a pulley. There are displays like  
 remote control helicopters,judo,Morris
 dancing, disco dancing and a football 
 tournament.                           </content>
