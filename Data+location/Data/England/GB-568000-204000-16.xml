		<content> Moulsham Lodge is a residential       
 housing Estate,built between 1956 and 
 1968, when the southern suburbs of    
 Chelmsford were being developed.The   
 Estate contains around 1685 homes.    
 The Estate takes its name from the    
 18th.century house called{Moulsham    
{Lodge}which stands just to the north  
 of the estate.This was the lodge house
 for the much larger{Moulsham Hall}    
 which was the home of the {Mildmay    
{family.}Moulsham Hall no longer       
 exists.                               
 The land on which the houses now stand
 was once farmed by Moulsham Lodge and,
 before that, was part of the Mildmay  
 family estate.                        
 The modern housing estate covers an   
 area approximately one km. long by    
 half a kilometre wide.                
 The Estate has its own parade of      
 seventeen varied shops.               </content>
