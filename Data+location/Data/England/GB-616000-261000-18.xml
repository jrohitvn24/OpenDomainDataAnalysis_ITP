		<title>18Attitudes in Debenham (2).</title>
		<content>  Many Debenham inhabitants believe    
that the District Council should give a
greater share of its resources to      
Debenham rather than to Stowmarket,the 
largest town in the Mid-Suffolk        
district.Plans to build a swimming pool
at Stowmarket cause particular concern.
Others argue that the proposed new     
council houses and additional sheltered
accommodation show that Debenham gets a
fair share of available money.It is    
felt by some that the school pools and 
grounds in Debenham should be made     
available for community use throughout 
the year.                              
  Other complaints concern the         
excessive amount ot parking in the High
Street and the number of heavy lorries 
which pass through Debenham.The amount 
of litter has increased in recent years
and public places are not kept clear   
of grass and weeds.                    </content>
