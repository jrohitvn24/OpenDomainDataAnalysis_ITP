		<content> In the Domesday Book{Warboys}is spelt 
 "Wardebusc", thought to mean          
 "Look-out-wood".{Warboys }has grown   
 up on the southern edge of the Fens   
 so it is known to be a good farming   
 area, particularly for arable crops.  
 In  1901 much of the west side of     
{Warboys}was burned down by fire       
 so there are not many buildings that  
 are old and of historic interest. Just
 outside{Warboys}is an airfield that   
 was used in the Second World          
 War.Now it is mainly used for         
 arable crops and there is a small     
 industrial estate there.              
 The historic parts  of{Warboys}are the
 Clock Tower,Church, and Manor House.{ 
{Warboys}is situated some seven miles  
 north-east of Huntingdon,four miles   
 south of Ramsey and about seven miles 
 north of St.Ives. The population  of  
{Warboys}for 1985 is 2,870.            </content>
