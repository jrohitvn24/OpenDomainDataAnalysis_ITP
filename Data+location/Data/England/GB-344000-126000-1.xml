		<content> This area contrasts greatly with the  
 flat land of the Somerset Levels which
 lie to its north and south.The gently 
 undulating landscape supports numerous
 farms.Fields are small and are used   
 for grazing land and the cultivation  
 of crops,mainly cereals.The population
 is well scattered,but one village     
 dominates this area.Pitney  has many  
 old thatched cottages and             
 farmhouses,built of the local blue    
 lias.In recent years many new         
 detatched houses and bungalows have   
 been built in vacant plots within     
 Pitney,along the A372 at              
 Pibsbury,Upton and the western        
 outskirts of Somerton.The area has two
 major roads:the B3153 in the north,the
 A372 in the south and in between runs 
 the main line railway from Castle Cary
 to Taunton.All three follow a general 
 east_west course across the block.    </content>
