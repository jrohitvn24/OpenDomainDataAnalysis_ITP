		<content> The River Wear,the port and           
 shipbuilding are the main reasons for 
 Sunderland's growth to a population of
 over 300,000.Sunderland was an        
 important shipbuilding centre in the  
 17th.century and later,in 1834,the    
 town was producing about half of all  
 the ships built in this               
 country.Records show that coal was    
 shipped as early as 1396,but there was
 a lull and in 1565 Sunderland was     
 described as a 'fishing town'.By 1609 
 trade had grown to 11,000tonnes  of   
 coal exported and by 1710 coal        
 shipments had reached                 
 175,000tonnes.The peak figure was 5   
 million tonnes per year.Development of
 the port began in 1717.The North Docks
 were opened in 1837,the South Docks in
 1850 and Corporation Quay in 1934.
