		<content> A study and bathroom have been added  
 on the ground floor of the house which
 has 5 bedrooms and two bathrooms      
 upstairs; sitting room dining room and
 kitchen downstairs. Drove cottage is  
 unusual because it has two known      
 ghosts. Dr. Robinson is not a bit     
 afraid of ghosts. She always hoped    
 they would stay around longer. Dr     
 Barbara Robinson and her daughter     
 have seen one ghost a shape like a    
 human being, but not very detaild.    
 It looked like thick layers of grey   
 mesh. Elderly people of Compton       
 village say it is the ghost of a      
 shepherd who never received enough    
 wages and so he comes back looking for
 more money. The other ghost, a lady   
 wearing nice clothes is supposed to   
 hount the landing. Dr. Robinson has   
 not seen the lady ghost.
