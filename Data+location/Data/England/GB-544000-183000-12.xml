		<content>    I don't mind living in a tower     
 block. I can see as far as Dagenham   
 one way and as far as the Thames the  
 other way. I share my bedroom with my 
 brother. We have bunk beds. On our    
 walls there are posters of 'Wham' and 
 'Madness' who are our favourite pop   
 groups.                               
   In the front room we can watch the  
 television or a film on the video.    
 Last Christmas my mother bought us    
 some computer games to play.          
   At night time is the only time I    
 don't like living here. It's noisy    
 from next door, and you can hear them 
 shouting or playing loud music through
 the walls. When someone has a party   
 upstairs you can hear thumping and    
 singing all night.                    
   In the day it's okay.
