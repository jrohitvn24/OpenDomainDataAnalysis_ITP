		<content> Generally,houses are small and fairly 
 uniform in accomodation, 3-4 bed-     
 rooms, 2 sitting rooms, kitchen and   
 indoors bathroom and lavatory. There  
 are some grander houses, a few still  
 privately occupied by very wealthy    
 owners; several have been divided into
 flats or individual appartments.      
 A mobile homes site is occupied by    
 retired and working people.           
  Most households are family groups;   
 normally with washing machine,        
 refrigerator and television: most have
 telephone and freezer. People take a  
 pride in their homes, the majority    
 being owner occupied. Gardens being   
 bright with flowers, lawns are        
 extending while the vegetable patch   
 shrinks. The advent of the Farm Shop  
 and'Pick Your Own'fruit and vegetables
 is partly responsible, but birds and  
 pests deter the less skilled gardener.</content>
