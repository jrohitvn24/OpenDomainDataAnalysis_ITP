     Preston is an abbreviation of     
 priest town,which rightly indicates   
 its strong religious traditions.Roman 
 Catholicism is still strong in the    
 area &amp; has been joined by Muslim &amp;    
 West Indian culture. Originally a town
 of trade &amp; craftsmen,it became centre 
 of the textile industry,specialising  
 in cotton sheets &amp; towelling.This     
 lasted for over 100 years but         
 eventually, a victim of cheap foreign 
 imports,the textile industry declined 
 to be replaced by aircraft            
 construction and major electrical     
 plant manufacture. A major crossroads 
 for all parts of Lancashire. Preston  
 has seen an influx of immigrants from 
 both the Indian Sub-continent and the 
 West Indies. It is now the heart of   
 the Central Lancashire New Town based 
 on Leyland,Chorley and itself.        </content>
