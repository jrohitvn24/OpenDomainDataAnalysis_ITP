		<title>05FARMING, CHICKEN FARM</title>
		<content> The farm which we visited lies on     
 Dalton Back Lane. THe chickens are    
 brought from a hatchery near Thirsk   
 and about 600,000 birds pass through  
 the farm each year. They are strictly 
 rationed -170 tons of grain and       
 13,000 gallons of water for  13,500   
 pullets, in 30 days.                  
 Each crop of chickens stays until they
 are 42 to 72 days old and then they   
 are moved to town factories to be     
 killed. After each crop the farm is   
 cleaned and disinfected and clean     
 chopped straw is put down.            
 The large concern which owns this farm
 has other farms in the area. The      
 managers live on the site but are not 
 allowed to keep pigs or pigeons in    
 case disease spreads to the           
 chickens.The present managers have    
 been at the farm for 17 years and work
 with a floating staff.                </content>
