		<title>20ATTITUDES IN MAWNAN</title>
		<content> Mawnan is not a typical Cornish       
 village as it has a large proportion  
 of retired people from other regions. 
 The young people often have to leave  
 to find work and cheaper housing as   
 local prices are inflated due to the  
 holiday trade. However the village has
 a strong community spirit with a great
 feeling of local pride in both the way
 of life and the outstanding natural   
 beauty of the area.                   
 The future of the village lies with   
 the children of{Mawnan Smith Primary  
 School.The survey has provided a      
 valuable means of assessing their     
 community and their future in it.
