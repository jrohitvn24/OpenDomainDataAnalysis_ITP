		<content> Dodsworth Coaches is a small coach    
 firm which started after the 1914-1918
 war. Its founder was H.Dodsworth (the 
 grandfather of the present owner) with
 his sons, Wilf, Jack and Sid.         
 It was sold to West Yorkshire in      
 November 1931. Jack started in January
 1932 when he bought a bus for Â£70     
 and had                               
 built the number of buses up to 8 when
 he died in 1963. The firm moved from  
 Minskip , where it originally started,
 to a new site in Boroughbridge in     
 August 1977.                          
 There are now 11 coaches, including 6 
 executive coaches with toilets, videos
 and drinks. These coaches travel all  
 over Europe on holiday trips, visiting
 places such as Spain, Italy and       
 France. The other coaches run an all  
 year service for schools and private  
 parties.                              </content>
