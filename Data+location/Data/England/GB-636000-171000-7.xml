		<content>    Situated at one corner of Britain  
 no motorways go through our area.     
 Though the A28 reaches to Margate. We 
 have a network of minor roads linking 
 to Margate and Broadstairs, and the M2
 has speeded our journeys to London.   
 Many of our local roads were old      
 country lanes which have never been   
 widened and are consequently very     
 congested at times, especially in     
 summer when the holiday-makers are in 
 Clifftonville. Some newer roads are   
 wider including those built for the   
 trams or the trains which never       
 reached Clifftonville. Most of the    
 roads were badly pot holed during the 
 cold winter of January 1985 when even 
 Pegwell Bay froze over. We are        
 writting this in June 1985 and work is
 still going on repairing the roads.
