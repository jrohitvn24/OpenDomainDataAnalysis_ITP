		<title>13GOXHILL PRIMARY SCHOOL.</title>
		<content> The school moved into its present     
 building in two stages - the Juniors  
 in September 1975 and the Infants the 
 following Easter. There are almost 200
 children on role in three Junior and  
 three Infant classes which are        
 preceded by a nursery class with      
 children from three and a half years  
 of age. Most children go on to        
 Baysgarth Comprehensive School in     
 Barton for their secondary education. 
 Thornton Curtis, Burnham and Goxhill  
 Marsh children come to school daily by
 bus. There are 8 classrooms, 4 each on
 opposite sides of a central hall. The 
 eighth classroom is used as a school  
 library and resources room. The school
 has its own playing fields and kitchen
 to cook school meals. Over half the   
 children have a school meal costing   
 60 p., a few go home and slightly     
 less than half bring a packed lunch.  </content>
