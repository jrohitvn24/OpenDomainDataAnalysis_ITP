 A new estate has been built opposite  
 Herontyre. Just under 400 plots were  
 made available.The concern expressed  
 by local authorities was that         
 extensive woodland had to remain as a 
 boundary to the estate and no         
 development was allowed until 2 major 
 roads had been laid-Woodberry Drive   
 and Estcots Drive.The estate is sited 
 at the bottom of a shallow valley and 
 the flow of water was a major problem 
 and this led to the doubling in the   
 size of the sewage pipes being laid as
 the others were inadequate.The        
 children on the estate have 2 play    
 sites- something stipulated by the    
 council.An extension into the         
 surrounding woodland is forbidden.
