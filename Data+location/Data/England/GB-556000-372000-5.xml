		<content> Along Seabank Road at the Dell over   
 looking the beach three sailors would 
 go for a couple of drinks at the Dell 
 quite a few years ago.When ever they  
 were passing they always stopped for  
 a drink and once they all got pushed  
 down into the cells underneath the    
 actual pub and locked probably for    
 punishment.They stayed in there for a 
 few months then they died and left    
 nothing except their clothes.Now when 
 it's nearly dark you can hear them    
 banging on the door and sort of       
 scratching or groaning to get out.    
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
