		<content> In a hundred years time people could  
 be going for holidays in space, or    
 even living there. People may not be  
 working in factories as the work may  
 be done by computers and robots.      
 Transport could be very different as  
 oil resources may have been           
 exhausted, although new vehicles could
 be invented using other fuels. The    
 clothing people wear will be very     
 different.  New materials may be used 
 and wool and animal fibre cloths may  
 not be available.  If the world       
 population increases as expected there
 will be fewer animals, forests and    
 cultivated land. Cities will be even  
 larger.  Schools may become obsolete  
 and teaching taken over by computers. 
 In general, we think that the earth   
 will  become very crowded and people  
 will have to move into space to live.
