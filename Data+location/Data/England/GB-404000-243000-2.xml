		<title>02THE VALE OF EVESHAM</title>
		<content>  This particular area of the{Vale of  
{Evesham}is very fertile with all of   
 the land being cultivated in some form
 or other. Much of this land ,         
 particularly in the{Offenham}area, is 
 intensively cultivated with a lot of  
 it under glass. The whole area        
 consists of the{Bengeworth}part of    
 Evesham, the village of{Badsey}, part 
 of Offenham and the smaller hamlets of
{Aldington}and{Blackminster}.          
  Most of the area lies to the East of 
 the{River Avon}before it enters the   
 town of Evesham itself, infact, the   
 Bengeworth part of Evesham is that    
 which lies on the East side of the    
 Avon. A small part of the area        
 concerned does spread to the West side
 of the Avon also.
