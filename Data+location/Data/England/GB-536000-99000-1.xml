		<title>01Telscombe Cliffs Today</title>
		<content>  Telscombe Cliffs is a small seaside  
 residential area. Most people find    
 employment in neighbouring Peacehaven 
 or the bigger towns of Brighton and   
 Newhaven.In the last three years there
 has been a rapid increase in housing  
 developments, much land previously    
 classed as greenbelt has now been     
 built on, but there is little sign of 
 a similiar growth in amenities such as
 health centres,youth clubs etc.The    
 local school is full with all classes 
 the maximum allowed size.The sea al-  
 though accessable is not ideal for    
 bathing as sewage from here, Saltdean,
 Rottingdean and Brighton is pumped in 
 to it.The original Victorian sewers   
 are still used when the newly built   
 system breaks down.The nearest cross  
 Channel port is Newhaven 4 miles east 
 &amp; Brighton the nearest major entertain
 ment centre is 7 miles to the west.   </content>
