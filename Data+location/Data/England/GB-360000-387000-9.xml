		<title>09CHURCH STREET</title>
		<content>    Without doubt, Church Street is the
 oldest street in Warrington. At its   
 eastern end stands Warrington Parish  
 Church, dedicated to St.Elphin. The   
 church stands on the site of a Saxon  
 church and has a spire 281 feet high -
 a landmark for miles around.          
 Originally the centre of Warrington,  
 the church is now two-thirds of a mile
 from the town-centre, but is still the
 centre for civic occasions.           
    A market was once held in the      
 street, a charter for which was       
 granted in 1277. Church Street        
 contains two tudor cottages, next to  
 which is the site of an hostelry where
 Oliver Cromwell stayed in 1648. There 
 is also the National School,          
 Warrington's first elementary school, 
 founded by public subscription in     
 1833. The area has recently been      
 designated a conservation area.       </content>
