		<content>  The White Hart, a timber-framed      
building constructed in 1444 as the    
Chantry House for Sir John Golafre,    
draws many Oxford students and their   
families.  It is reputed to have a     
cavalier ghost.  Mr. Howard the        
proprietor has established it as an    
excellent restaurant as well as a pub. 
Many local people use it.  There is no 
overnight accommodation but people are 
recommended to Manor Farm, which is    
included in the Farm Holiday Guide.    
Visitors enjoy the fine trees and deep 
sense of history.                      
  The Baptist Chapel, along with 4     
cottages, is cut off from the village  
by the bypass.  It is over 150 years   
old.  The congregation averages about  
40 and consists of students and        
families not from Fyfield, but from a  
ten mile radius.  The minister Mr.     
Aldridge is a part-time dental surgeon </content>
