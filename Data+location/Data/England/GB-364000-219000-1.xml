		<content> The area under Survey is              
 administered by Gloucestershire and   
 the County of Hereford and            
 Worcester.  At the lowest tier of     
 administration there are 7 parishes:  
 The Lea, Weston under Penyard, Hope   
 Mansell, Drybrook, Mitcheldean,       
 Longhope and Aston Ingham.            
    Just over 25% is on a forested     
 plateau which is part of The Royal    
 Forest of Dean.  Of the remaining area
 70% is undulating farmland.           
    There are only 2 main residential  
 areas yet there are small scattered   
 hamlets, farmhouses and cottages      
 across the whole spectrum many in     
 complete isolation.                   
    The village of The Lea is the only 
 community that has the characteristic 
 features of rural life, namely, Parish
 Church,Village School  and an Inn.
