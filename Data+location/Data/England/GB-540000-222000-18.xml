        THE BLACK HOUND                
                                       
As well as [REDACTED] and Upp 
Hall there is another haunting which 
involves everybody in the area even 
though they may not realise it. 
It involves a black hound which 
roams the streets day or night. 
Some people may have seen it without
knowing what they are seeing. 
The only proof that there is a 
phantom hound roaming the streets of 
this area is that at least one person 
has seen it walk through a garden 
wall. 
Legend has it that this dog belonged 
to the local gamekeeper but was shot 
after the gamekeeper was killed in an 
accident.                        
                                       
                                       </content>
