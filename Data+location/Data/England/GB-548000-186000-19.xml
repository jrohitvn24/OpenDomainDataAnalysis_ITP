		<title>19DENIS'S VIEW OF DAGENHAM</title>
		<content>                                       
  Mr.Denis Marshall is 57 years old and
 has lived in Dagenham all his life.   
 He thinks that Dagenham is not        
 such a nice place to live in as it was
 years ago.People seem less friendly   
 and shopping facilities are poorer.Big
 shopping centres such as Romford cater
 for all needs instead of the local    
 shops.Food shops locally are fine     
 though.He feels that schools,transport
 services and youth clubs have all     
 deteriorated over the years,and that  
 vandalism and violence have increased.
  To improve things Denis would employ 
 more street cleaners,have more police 
 on foot patrol,create more areas for  
 children to play safely and to let off
 steam,and generally tidy up the       
 place.Although he would like to see   
 changes Denis can't imagine how they  
 would come about.                     </content>
