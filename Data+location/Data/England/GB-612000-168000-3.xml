		<title>03OYSTERS AT HAMPTON,HERNE BAY</title>
		<content> In 1985 Hampton Pier is a short solid 
 concrete structure about 70 yards long
 and from the end of this a line of    
 rocks show how the original pier      
 extended further into the sea. The    
 Pier appears to be of little practical
 use but during the second half of the 
 last Century it was very busy with the
 boats which came from English and     
 Continental ports in connection with  
 the oyster trade. Twice a week oysters
 were taken to Billingsgate from the   
 Hampton Oyster Beds and there was also
 a tramway from the Pier to the railway
 line. The oyster beds extended about  
 three miles from the shore. There were
 breeding pits inshore and the Company 
 built a row of 12 cottages for their  
 employees. The Company folded before  
 the turn of the Century apparently    
 after several sevre winters. The      
 cottages are gone as their land eroded</content>
