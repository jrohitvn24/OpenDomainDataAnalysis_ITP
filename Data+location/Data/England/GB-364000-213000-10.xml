		<title>10The World Today</title>
		<content> The World is a lovely place full of   
 things to do but bombs and things ruin
 it. Terrorists killing and kidnapping 
 people. Men that grab children and    
 kill them. Soon everyone will be too  
 scared to go outside the door.        
 Pickpockets are so bad takeing money  
 out of old peoles pockets. If the     
 world carries on like this the streets
 will soon be empty. This world has    
 lovely forests and lots of animals    
 too. The lakes, rivers and ponds full 
 of little creatures. I'd like the     
 world today if only the horrible      
 people would go away. I like the      
 cottages out in the country. The      
 hooligans that go to football do not  
 go for the game they go to cause      
 trouble. I think that people should be
 seached before they go into a match   
 for knives and drink.
