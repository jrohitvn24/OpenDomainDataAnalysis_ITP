		<title>01INTRODUCTION TO THE AREA.</title>
		<content> Most of the area is farmland.There is 
 a small residential area in one       
 corner and there are many farms.The   
 main farms are{Bilton Barns}and{      
{Greenrigg.}There are two small        
 villages,called Lesbury and Hipsburn. 
 Lesbury got its name from the leeches 
 which lived in the river.Hipsburn     
 originated from the stepping stones   
 across the river.Lesbury is made up   
 mainly from stone cottages, whilst    
 Hipsburn has more modern brick        
 buildings.There is an old church at   
 Lesbury dating from the twelfth       
 century.{Wooden Farm,}on the outskirts
 of Hipsburn,was built where a pack of 
 wolves once roamed.It was also        
 bombarded by the famous American      
 privateer,John Paul Jones,in the war  
 of 1812.
