 reference of 044470134 or on the      
 outskirts of Littleton.The camp holds 
 about one thousand civilians and      
 soldiers. All the soldiers are being  
 trained to be{Military Accoutants}.   
   The camp is heavily guarded with    
 Alsatians which they call {War Dogs,} 
 patrolling guards and barricads.Nearly
 all the men live on the camp.When they
 first go to the camp they sleep  in   
 four man rooms,but when they gain a   
 higher postion they have rooms of     
 their own.                            
   The{Adjutant}of Worthy Down lives in
 one of the houses just outside the    
 camp.He has a wife and a dog.When his 
 wife goes shopping she has to go to   
 Littleton or Winchester,because there 
 is only one shop in the camp which is 
 only a post office .The shop is called
 the N.A.A.F.I.                        </content>
