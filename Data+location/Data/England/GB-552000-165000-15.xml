		<title>15TOURISM-EYNSFORD</title>
		<content>We are only 20 miles from London, very 
near the M20 and attract many visitors.
Eynsford has interesting medieval      
houses, a 15th century Bridge over the 
River Darent, the ruins of a Norman    
castle and a church with its sided     
spire and a 13th century porch.        
Tourists come enjoy the village and    
many artistic people have decided to   
live in the area. A boy in our class   
lives in Willow Cottage where Graham   
Sutherland  the artist lived. Peter    
Warlock the composer once lived in a   
cottage near our school. C. Ross       
Parker who wrote    There'll Always be 
an England' lived here until 1974.     
At weekends and holidays we get lots   
of day trippers down by the river.     
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
