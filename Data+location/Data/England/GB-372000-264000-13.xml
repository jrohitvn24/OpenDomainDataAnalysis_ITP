		<content>{Scouts}is an organization where you   
 can work for badges and play          
 games.They have just made a new way of
 getting certain badges.You have a book
 in which you mark down the activities 
 you want to do.There are age groups   
 for each of the badges and when you   
 finish one you go straight on to the  
 next.Some of the badges we have to do 
 at home.There are swimming,athletics  
 collecters and others.When you get    
 older you can do sailing,rock climbing
 and other sports like that.I go for   
 one hour forty-five minutes.The games 
 we play are non-stop Cricket,Trenches,
 Circles,Captain is Coming Aboard and  
 others.The Scouts also go swimming on 
 Sunday morning at about seven o'clock.
 We go to indoor pools and an outdoor  
 pool.The outdoor pool is near Abberley
 Clock Tower.We also go on camps       
 without the leaders.                  </content>
