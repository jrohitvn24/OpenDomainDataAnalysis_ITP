 Interviews.....Past to Present.       
                                       
 We interviewed five people. Two were  
 over fifty years old. The others were 
 one each from 20-30, 30-40,40-50. They
 all felt that Huntington was a good   
 place to live,because it has always   
 been near the countryside. The older  
 people remembered when there was a    
 railway line with a station, but now  
 there is a pub: "The Flag and         
 Whistle", where the station used to   
 be. The railway used to go to Hull.   
 The biggest change has been the       
 building of new houses. Twenty years  
 ago Huntington was a quarter the size 
 it is now. Sewerage and water have    
 been introduced in the last thiry     
 years. The roads have been mde wider. 
 The leather factory has disappeared,  
 where a lot of people used to work.   </content>
