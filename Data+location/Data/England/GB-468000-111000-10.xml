		<title>10A DAY AT WECOCK SCHOOL</title>
		<content> At 8.50a.m. the bell is rung in the   
 playground. We go into school, put our
 coats in the cloakroom and go to our  
 classrooms for registration. At       
 9.10a.m. there is Assembly in the     
 Hall. At 9.30a.m. it is time for      
 English work until playtime at        
 10.30a.m. After games in the          
 playground it is Mathematics from     
 10.45a.m. until 12.00 noon.  We have  
 lunch either at home or in school, or 
 a sandwich meal and then playtime     
 until 1.10p.m. The afternoon session  
 starts with registration and is       
 followed by a variety of lessons,e.g. 
 topic, science, craft, games, music,  
 art, and computing. School finishes at
 3.30p.m. We put up our chairs and go  
 home.
