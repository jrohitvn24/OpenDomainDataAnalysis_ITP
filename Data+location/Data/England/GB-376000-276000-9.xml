		<title>09Farming - Severn Valley/Wyre</title>
		<content> A rich agricultural area bordering a  
 river basin. Mainly mixed farming with
 cereals, fruit, sugar-beet (refined   
 locally), dairy and beef cattle.      
 Milk is collected daily by the Milk   
 Marketing Board, beef is auctioned at 
 local cattle markets and free-range   
 eggs are available from farmhouses. At
 Bite Farm several rare breeds of sheep
 and goat are kept which are listed by 
 the Rare Breeds Survival Trust. These 
 are: Bagot, Golden Guernsey and Pigmy 
 goats; Herdwick, White Faced Woodland,
 Soay, Portland and North Ronaldsay    
 sheep: kept for conservation purposes 
 only. A tradition has built up of     
 smallholdings selling their produce on
 the roadside; plums, apples and       
 cherries from the orchards and a      
 selection of vegetables. A recent     
 innovation is 'Pick Your Own' fruit   
 and vegetables at lower prices.       </content>
