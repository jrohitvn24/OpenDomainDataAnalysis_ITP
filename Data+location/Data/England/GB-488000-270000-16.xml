		<content>                                       
 Most of the farms around Finedon are  
arable farms.The main crop is wheat of 
which 2 varieties are grown.1 for      
bread and 1 for cattle food.Barley's   
also grown for cattle food.More and    
more land is being used to grow rape   
for its oil used in many products such 
as margarine.                          
 Townside Farm (466 acres) is mainly   
arable.A few cattle are bought in for  
fattening.Scotch half breed sheep are  
kept.Shearing is done by the 3 farm    
workers.                               
 Busiest time of the year is harvest   
when the crops have to be reaped and   
dried before storage.                  
 The biggest change in farming has been
the change from horse drawn implements 
to the complex machinery of today.
