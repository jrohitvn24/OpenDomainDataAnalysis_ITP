		<content>{St. Laurence's Church}Wichenford is   
 one of four small village churches    
 under the care of{Reverend Goddard.   
 The building has stood since the      
{1400's}and contains tombs and effigies
 of the{Washbournes,}early parish      
 squires, whose descendants now live in
 America, but still maintain and visit 
 their ancestral church.               
 There are{six Sunday services}a month;
 four Communions, one Mattins and a    
 Family Service. The{old prayer book}is
 used for two of the Communions, and   
 the{Alternate Service}book otherwise. 
 All church festivals are celebrated,  
 as is the{Parish Fete in June.        
 A{leather bound bible}was presented by
 the Britten family in{1867.}100 years 
 later two grandsons read  the lessons,
 and that same bible used today .      
 Patron,{St. Laurence,}was a{martyr    
 burned in Rome for his Christianity.  </content>
