		<content> A FARMER TOLD US OF A UFO HE HAD SEEN 
 TEN DAYS BEFORE WE VISITED HIM.       
 HE SAID HE THOUGHT THE CHIMNEY WAS ON 
 FIRE BUT HE THEN HE HEARD A NOISE OVER
 HIS ROOF AND HE WATCHED AS THE UFO    
 DISAPEARED OVER THE HILLS.AFTER THIS  
 ACCURANCE HE WONDERED WETHER IT WAS A 
 MILLATARY NEW DEVELOPMENT OR A UFO.HE 
 DECIDED IT HAD TO HAVE BEEN A UFO FOR 
 THE COLOUR,SHAPE AND NOISE MADE AND   
 THIS WAS LATER REPORTED IN A PAPER.
