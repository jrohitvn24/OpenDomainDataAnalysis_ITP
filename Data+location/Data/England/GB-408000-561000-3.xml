		<content> Kimberly-Clark Limited was opened on  
 the 29th of November 1971. The factory
 was built for production of: Kitchen  
 towels, handkerchieves, medical wipes,
 tampons, feminine towels, toilet      
 tissues, etc. It was opened by        
 Princess Anne. When the factory opened
 the managing director of              
 Kimberly-Clark was Derek Croxon. It   
 cost over Â£10 million to build and has
 brought 946 people jobs (140-150 of   
 them are for women). It took over 2   
 years to develop the 53 acres site on 
 the banks of the River Tyne,          
 demolishing old chemical works and    
 building the most modern paper tissue 
 mill in Europe in it's place.         
    Prudhoe was selected for 4 reasons:
 Plentiful water, adequate land, good  
 communications and workforce. The     
 average wages for 3 shift workers=Â£550
 and for 4 shift workers=Â£700 a month. </content>
