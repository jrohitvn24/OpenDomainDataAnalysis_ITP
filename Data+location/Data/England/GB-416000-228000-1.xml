		<content> The area is situated in the           
 N.Cotswolds.The landscape consists    
 of gently undulating hills;the highest
 point is approximately 800ft. above   
 sea level.The land is fairly          
 intensively farmed &amp; cereal &amp; fruit   
 growing predominate.Settlements are   
 dispersed although there are the      
 villages of Longborough &amp;             
 Donnington.Dwellings are mainly of    
 Cotswold Stone &amp; it is an area of     
 rising house prices as it becomes     
 increasingly popular as a retirement  
 haven.Longborough is an attractive    
 village &amp; possesses a school, post    
 office, church &amp; pub.Donnington is    
 equally attractive but considerably   
 smaller &amp; is largely dependent upon   
 Broadwell nearby as it has no services
 of its own.Dry Cotswold stone walls   
 are a feature of the landscape.
