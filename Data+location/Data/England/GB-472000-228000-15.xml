		<title>15 Sick Benefit Society</title>
		<content> When the sick club was formed in      
Padbury about 130 years ago there was  
no National insurance or sick pay from 
the estate.The villages worked locally 
mostly as farm labourers, and were     
fairly poor.They paid quarterly into   
the club, which then gave them money   
when they were ill.Money is still paid 
out to widows,although the club is not 
need now as it was years ago. Members  
were fined if they did not attend both 
club meetings and church regulary.     
Each year the club has a feast day at  
Whitsun. On Whit sunday a band, once   
the village band,but now GT Horwood    
band, plays in the church,then by the  
war memoral. On Whit Monday the band   
marches round the village,going from   
pub to pub.At 1.30 the procession      
arives at the Village Hall,formerly the
school,where the men eat a Traditional 
dinner of roast beef &amp; beer.           </content>
