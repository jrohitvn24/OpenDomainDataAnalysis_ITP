		<title>10A View of Dean</title>
		<content> I live in a small village called Lower
 Dean. The nearest shop is a mile away.
 If you want lots of food or almost    
 anything which is not groceries, you  
 go to Bedford.                        
 There is a Church in Upper Dean and   
 every Sunday the same vicar and the   
 people go to a different church  in   
 the 6 parishes (Dean, Melchbourne,    
 Shelton Swineshead, Yelden and        
 Pertenhall)                           
 Dean is a very pretty village with    
 lots of fields and wildlife - rabbits,
 hedgehogs, pheasants and lots more.   
 Upper Dean has got the wrong name     
 because it is down in a dip. There are
 a lot of dips in the fields which fill
 with water and an 8 ft. pond which has
 frogs and tadpoles in it.             
                                       
 (the thoughts of a 9 year old boy)
