  Out of our parents in the school 42% 
 of dads have professions and 58% are  
 non-professional.There are no         
 particular common professions or jobs.
 The University and College give       
 several parents occupations connected 
 with Education. There are quite a few 
 computer experts, several work for    
 Racal. One or two are connected with  
 the hospital and we have 3 ministers  
 amongst our dads. The non-professional
 include plumbers, bricklayers, tilers,
 waiters,shop owners and assistants and
 several salesman.  65% of our mums go 
 out to work (52 only part time). 24%  
 of mums hold professional jobs. Quite 
 a few are teachers,1 dentist, 1       
 accountant, and 1 doctor.The rest are 
 secretaries, sales ladies,florists and
 2 do ironing. 35% are housewives,most 
 with children in the Infants.         </content>
