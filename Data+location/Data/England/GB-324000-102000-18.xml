		<title>18THE TROUT FARM</title>
		<content> The trout farm is in the pretty little
 village called Membury.It has six     
 ponds and you can fish your self.You  
 have to put them back after.When they 
 are full,you can't fish your self.One 
 pond is on the other side of the road 
 and there is a gate to go             
 through.There you will see the young  
 trout about a week old.The first pond 
 is for the parent fish.The second     
 third and fourth ponds are where fish 
 can be caught and sold .Previously the
 building was used as a flour mill     
 driven by the water wheel which still 
 can be seen_thus the name Rock Mill.
