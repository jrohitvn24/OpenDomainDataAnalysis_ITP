 King Arthurs, involved in swimming,   
 craft, economics, trampolining,       
 pottery, tennis and just about every  
 other activity you can think of.It was
 the{Summer Activity week.

 activities. Brownies and Guides meet  
 in the Primary school. The 1st Winc.  
 Scouts, Cubs and Beavers meet in the  
 Youth club. A Scout hut is to be put  
 up in the recreation ground. There is 
 a desperate shortage of Scout leaders.

 lease the town hall for practice, so  
 they still use the primary school.When
