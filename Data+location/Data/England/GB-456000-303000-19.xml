		<title>19Leicester Great Central Way</title>
		<content> The Great Central Way is now a        
 tarmacadam footpath and cycle way into
 the City of Leicester. It begins about
 5 kilometres to the south of the city 
 centre. It was made as part of a      
 community work scheme.                
 The Great Central Way was originally  
 part of the Midland Region railway    
 network from London to the North of   
 England.                              
 Today many people use the Great       
 Central Way for leisure time walks or 
 cycling to work in the city centre.   
 Much of the surrounding land is now   
 landscaped and wildlife is encouraged 
 as much as possible.It is not uncommon
 to see foxes, rabbits, grey squirrels,
 stoats and a great variety of         
 birdlife. There are established       
 hawthorn hedgerows as well as newly   
 planted Buddleias and other shrubs.
