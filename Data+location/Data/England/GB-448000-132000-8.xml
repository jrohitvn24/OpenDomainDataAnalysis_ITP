		<content> Three{major roads}bisect King's Worthy
 and  it's two associated villages. The
 traffic on the King's Worthy Link     
 Bridge the{A34}can easily be seen     
 between Headbourne Worthy and King's  
 Worthy.                               
 The{A33 or Winchester By-pass         
 separates Abbots Worthy and King's    
 Worthy and during the summer months   
 and at weekends has always caused     
 major congestions and traffic flow    
 problems. It is an accident blackspot 
 with many serious accidents.          
 On May 22nd 1985 the newest stretch of
 the{M3 Motorway}opened between Popham 
 and Easton Lane, Winchester. Already  
 the local residents of King's Worthy  
 have noticed the improvment.The triple
 intersection is virtually free of fast
 moving and heavy, noisy traffic. The  
 newest eleven mile stretch has cost   
 Â£25 million.                          </content>
