		<content>   More people on average go to{church 
 in this area than in many other areas 
 in 1985. This is perhaps a reflection 
 on the habits of an{older population. 
 However, within our block{St. Peter's 
 Church has a very healthy{younger     
{element}and so has St. Michael's. The 
 former is always full on a Sunday     
 morning and has a cathedral standard  
{choir.}The church is also used for    
 local{music concerts.}Each June it has
 a special festival{week of flowers and
{music.}At Christmas there is a custom 
 of giving{"Christingle" oranges}to    
 children to remind them of the true   
 meaning of Christmas. This originated 
 in Central Europe.                    
   Other local customs include{Morris  
{Dancing}and playing the{Sussex game of
{stool ball.}Some dialect words are    
 still in common use in our block such 
 as{"Twittens"}for footpaths or alleys.</content>
