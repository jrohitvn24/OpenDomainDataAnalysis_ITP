		<title>01S E Fakenham and Area</title>
		<content> Our block includes the SE quarter of  
 Fakenham and the neighbouring farmland
 as far as lower Great Ryburgh. In the 
 1068 Domesday Book the town is entered
 as Faganham. Today it is a small      
 market town set amid mainly arable    
 farmland. The River Wensum (a trout   
 stream) runs through the town. The    
 population is about 5500. The market  
 (no longer a cattle market) and       
 auction are held on Thursdays. There  
 has been an increase in unemployment  
 since the main printing works closed, 
 although there is some light industry 
 and farm work (including seasonal part
 time work). Our corner of Fakenham is 
 mainly residential and doesn't cover  
 the town centre. The rest of our block
 contains the racecourse, 3 farms and  
 part of Great Ryburgh - a small       
 village with a maltings where barley  
 is prepared for brewing.              </content>
