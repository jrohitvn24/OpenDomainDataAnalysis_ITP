		<content> The construction of the Midland       
 Railway Sheffield to Manchester line  
 through the Hope Valley was the last  
 major trans Pennine rail route to be  
 completed. The line was opened to     
 traffic in 1893.                      
   The principal engineering features  
 of the line were Cowburn Tunnel       
 (3,702 yds long) to the west of Edale 
 village and Totley Tunnel (6,230 yds  
 long) at the eastern end of the       
 valley. In 1985 the latter is the     
 longest railway tunnel in the United  
 Kingdom. At the Western portal of the 
 tunnel is Grindleford Station situated
 in Padley woods, but over one mile    
 from the heart of the village.        
   Today the station is unstaffed and  
 served each weekday by 19 passenger   
 trains travelling between Sheffield   
 and New Mills.
