		<title>05HOUSING IN BLOFIELD HEATH</title>
		<content>   In the Blofield Heath area we       
 studied 135 homes.  Of these, the     
 majority were bungalows or chalets.   
 Most of these were modern, there were 
 very few old houses in the area.  Both
 old and new homes had the same size   
 gardens, which were small.  There were
 no specific parts where the old houses
 are situated, they are all scattered  
 around.  All of them were privately   
 owned.  Most of the bungalows were    
 fairly large, often with three        
 bedrroms.                             
   The modern homes were built in the  
 ealy 70s, the older houses were built 
 in the 50s after the war.  The homes  
 were set out in lines fairly close    
 together.                             
   Most of the homes were situated     
 along one road or in cul_de_sacs      
 branching off the main roads.
