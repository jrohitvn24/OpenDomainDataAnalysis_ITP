		<title>15A Sunday in the Life of Kel.</title>
		<content>    At 8 o'clock I woke up but I didn't
 get dressed and go downstairs until 25
 to 9. At a quarter to 9 I had my      
 breakfast of "Weetabix" and then at 10
 to 9 I watched a video of the FA Cup  
 Final. My favourite team Manchester   
 Utd. had won the cup the day before,  
 beating Everton 1-0. A GREAT VIDEO!   
    At a quarter past 9 I went to play 
 football with my friend John Clarkson.
 I went home at 1 o'clock and I had my 
 dinner.                               
    After dinner I went out again at   
 1.30pm on my BMX bike. I played on my 
 bicycle until I went to my Granddad's 
 house at 3 o'clock. We came home at   
 4.15 and I went out to play again. I  
 had my tea at 6.45 and a bath at      
 7.30pm. I finally went to bed at      
 9.15pm.                               
                                       
                                       </content>
