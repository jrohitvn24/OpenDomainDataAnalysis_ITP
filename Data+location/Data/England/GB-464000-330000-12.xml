		<title>12People's Jobs in Kinoulton</title>
		<content>   We collected{questionnaires}from    
 parents of 20 children asking them    
 about their jobs.With the information 
 we were able to find that the average 
 distance travelled was 15.6 miles     
 daily.The average hours worked in a   
 week was 44.27. We went round the     
 school asking all the children who    
 lived in our area what their parents' 
 jobs were.Some we found were quite    
 interesting-one person works in a firm
 manufacturing scientific instruments, 
 another makes electric generators, a  
 few people work in other countries.   
 With this new information we worked   
 out percentages-{22%}public services, 
{26%}managers,{12%}engineers,{8%}build-
 ers,{18%}salesmen,{8%}others. What we 
 found strange was, though we live in a
 rural area, only{6%}are farmers where-
 as 50 years ago most people would have
 worked on the land or locally.        </content>
