		<title>15Education in Wootton</title>
		<content>    In 1959,the Bishop of Oxford opened
 Wootton C of E School,  on the site of
 another school on farmland.65 children
 and  two  full-time teachers go to the
 school. The school relies on voluntary
 help from parents, following{education
{cuts }which  have  also  affected  the
 range  of  activities  like computing,
 woodwork and crafts.                  
    44  children have school meals and,
 according to the cook who has provided
 these  meals  for 32 years, they still
 like  the same meals today as they did
 then.  The  children  enjoy  practical
 tasks   like   building   a  pond  and
 producing  vegetables  and  flowers in
 their school garden.                  
    Most  of  the  children  go  on  to
 schools  in  Abingdon and as no school
 bus  is  provided  the local authority
 plans to establish a{cycle track}along
 the B417.                             </content>
