A major change from 1986 has been that farm unit size has increased with smaller family farms being bought by neighbours.  This has resulted in consolidation with larger farm machinery being used but with fewer people being employed on the land.  Consequently many of the inhabitants of Ovington are now retired/semiretired.  Some are professionals from teaching or hospital backgrounds, others from other streams of civil service.  Younger individuals continue to run internet based businesses from home (though struggle with poor service provision - many modern facilities like fast broadband, good mobile phone connections and gas remain unavailable).  Only three homes remain under council control, one with retired occupants, the others with unemployed families.  Employment in the area generally is suppressed and poorly remunerated compared to other regions.   &lt;br />
