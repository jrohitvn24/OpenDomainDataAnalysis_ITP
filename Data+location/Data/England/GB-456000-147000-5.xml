		<title>05Transport South of Oakley 2</title>
		<content> The area of South Oakley and Pardown  
 are served by the{National Bus Company
 with a route to and from Basingstoke  
 Bus Terminus. These are usually two   
 buses per hour with three at the peak 
 times when people are travelling to   
 and from work (0800 to 0900 and 1700  
 to 1800).                             
                                       
 The{London/Southampton railway}passes 
 through the area but due to the fact  
 that there is no local railway station
 it serves only to act as a barrier to 
 road and foot transport which are     
 limited to crossing by the bridges.   
                                       
{Helicopters}from nearby R.A.F. Odiham 
 cross the area daily and create noise 
 which is a cause for complaint by     
 local residents.
