 Set in a quiet valley these 2 small   
 establishments,with one owner,are the 
 only places which could be classed as 
 light industry within this D.Block.   
 The slaughterhouse,employing 2 men,   
 receives only dead animals from local 
 farms;these are cut up and dressed.   
 The meat,which is all unfit for human 
 consumption,goes to a {pet food }firm 
 in Crewe for canning. The {skins }are 
 bought by a firm in Lichfield,which   
 makes small {leather }items such as   
 handbags. Some waste meat goes to the 
 Corvedale  Bait Company,across the    
 yard on the same site. Here,{maggots} 
 are bred,stored in large fridges and  
 retailed by the gallon to fishing     
 tackle shops.One man is employed to   
 tend the bait company. In addition two
 lorries are used for transportation of
 goods.                                </content>
