		<title>06Sheep farming.</title>
		<content> We visited a sheep farmer.He farms 35O
 acres, and has 2l7O sheep. They are   
 Border Leicesters and Mules. The sheep
 feed on grass in the summer and the   
 lambs feed on creep which is barley   
 and flaked wheat. The ewes get a lot  
 of illnesses; black udder, fluke,     
 stomach worms and twin lamb disease.  
 Lambs can have sway back if they are  
 not treated. Scab is the major        
 disease; sheep have to be dipped twice
 annually. The farm has shifts during  
 lambing. The lambs are kept for about 
 l6 to 2O weeks, and the ewes for 5    
 years. There are two sheep dogs,      
 Archie, aged 7 and Flash who is 2     
 years old. At shearing time, four men 
 shear twenty five sheep each in one   
 hour. The farmer goes to market to buy
 and sell sheep.
