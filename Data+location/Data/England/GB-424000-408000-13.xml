		<title>13Family Life by an 8yr.old</title>
		<content> My mum has a very hard life. She has  
 to get the food and clean the house.  
 She goes down to Denby Dale pays the  
 rent for the video  and gets the      
 groceries. She goes out at night and  
 helps at school. On Saturday she helps
 me and my dad in the garden. Mum      
 helps my sister to read and teaches me
 sums that I have trouble with.        
    My Dad  goes round the world       
 on business. When he's at home he     
 takes us out shopping. Dad teaches me 
 to sail.                              
     My sister and I go to the same    
 school. I help her with things that   
 are hard. My sister is five and I'm   
 eight.                                
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
