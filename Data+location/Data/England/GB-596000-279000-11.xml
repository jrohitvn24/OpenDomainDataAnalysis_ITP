		<title>11GAMEKEEPING, RIDDLESWORTH</title>
		<content> The present gamekeeper has been at the
 Riddlesworth estate for the past 33   
 years having followed in his father's 
 footsteps.  He works non-stop through-
 out the week.   The estate has 2000   
 acres of oak, ash, beech, lime, birch,
 sycamore, chestnut and fir trees.     
 There are a few roe and red deer as   
 well as stoats, weasles and foxes.    
 The rabbits all have mixamatosis.  The
 gamekeeper rears pheasants and        
 partridges from one day old.  They are
 fed on wheat.  1800 to 1900 birds are 
 freed each year. Shooters from all    
 over the country are invited to shoot 
 here.  The shooting season starts on 1
 September for partridges and l October
 for pheasants lasting until l         
 February.  Most of the birds are shot 
 each year.  There are quite a few     
 poachers on the estate, some of whom  
 are caught.                           </content>
