		<content> This area has no feudal tradition with
 a 'big house'supporting estate workers
 Instead there are many successful and 
 enterprising self-employed people.    
 Others who work outside the area live 
 here because they prefer the mixed    
 community, and find their recreation  
 in local activities. Much practical   
 kindness is shown in care of those in 
 need of help of many sorts and there  
 is great generosity in answer to calls
 for funds for local, national and     
 international charities. There is     
 interest in keeping local footpaths,  
 and some concern about the quality of 
 drinking water may soon be allayed    
 when our new supply is connected.     
 There is worry about possible closure 
 of churches, schools, shops and bus   
 routes.
