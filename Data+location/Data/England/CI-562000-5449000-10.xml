		<title>10MILLBROOK RESVR,WATERWKS VAL</title>
		<content> Many valleys in Jersey are used for   
 storing drinking water for the people 
 of the island. Some of the first      
 reservoirs to be built are to be found
 in {Waterworks Valley}on the border of
{St.Lawrence.}The valley itself is     
 particularly beautiful because of     
 the many different deciduous trees to 
 be found there.                       
{Millbrook Reservoir}was completed in  
 1899 and was originally designed to to
 store 12 million gallons of water. It 
 receives its water from the streams of
{St.Lawrence}and also from a small     
 pumping station in{Bellozanne Valley.}
 After filtration and sterilization the
 stored water is pumped to the {       
{Westmount Service Reservoir}and from  
 there to the customer. Until 1932     
 Millbrook was the only treatment plant
 in Jersey.
