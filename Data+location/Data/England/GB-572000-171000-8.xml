		<content> The largest bomb 33 Regiment has had  
 to deal with was an 1,800 kilogram    
 bomb. Units of 33 Regiment are often  
 requested to go to different parts of 
 the world. Recent tours have included 
 Hong Kong, Solomon Islands, Bahamas   
 and the Channel Islands. There is     
 now a permanent detachment in the     
 Falkland Islands.A lot of 33 Regiments
 day to day work is in the dangerous   
 task of clearing training areas to    
 make them safe for handing back to the
 public sector. Most of the equipment  
 used by 33 Regiment is highly         
 specialised. They have equipment      
 capable of detecting explosive devices
 underground, special equipment for    
 digging down to the bomb and of course
 special tools for making the bomb safe
 and removing the explosives. Their job
 is very dangerous most of the time and
 especially so in winter.              </content>
