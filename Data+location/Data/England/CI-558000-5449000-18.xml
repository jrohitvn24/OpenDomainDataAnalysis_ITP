		<content>   It is 1985, and we now have 4       
 television channels, BBC1, BBC2,      
 CHANNEL (our local Channel Islands    
 channel) and CHANNEL4.                
   Most homes now have colour sets     
 instead of black and white. The annual
 licence fee is Â£46 which is paid to   
 the British Broadcasting Corporation. 
 You are fined if it is not paid.      
   We now have two channels which put  
 out an early morning programme which  
 has become very popular since it      
 started two years ago. It covers news,
 sport, music, cookery, fashion etc.   
 During the rest of the day typical    
 programmes are news, weather, sport   
 (for example football, cricket,       
 horse-racing, snooker) and children's 
 shows, such as Blue Peter and         
 cartoons. There are also soap operas  
 such as{Dynasty, Coronation Street and
{Dallas.}                              </content>
