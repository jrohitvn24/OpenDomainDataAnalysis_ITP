		<content> Tanners' Dairy in Little Shelford has 
 been running for over 40 years and    
 delivers to Little Shelford,Great     
 Shelford and Stapleford.              
   They do not have their own cows,    
 however they have a bottling station  
 in Headingham.The station sends the   
 milk(bottled)which is stored in       
 crates,to them from Headingha         
   The bottles of milk are kept cool   
 and fresh in giant refrigerators,they 
 have 3 of these.                      
   They employ 20 men to work on the   
 dairy,some of which drive the milk    
 floats.On their rounds they sell milk,
 fizzy drinks,and fruit juices.        
    In the shop at the dairy they not  
 only sell dairy  products (such as    
 cheese and milk)but,frozen produce and
 fresh fruit as well.
