		<content> The church could have been built as   
 early as AD650.There are traces of an 
 original Saxon nave window in one of  
 the present arches of the church.One  
 of the stained glass windows recently 
 fitted includes hunting,cricketing and
 scenes of the village.The Greene      
 family have memorials in the church   
 one of which is suitable for          
 brass-rubbing.Lady Greene was the     
 grandmother of Queen Catherine        
 Parr.The original Arms of Queen       
 Elizabeth dated 1592 and of King      
 George IV are fixed to the interior   
 north wall.The spire rebuilt in 1956  
 can be seen for many miles with an    
 avenue of trees leading to Easton     
 Neston House,home of the Hesketh      
 family.
