		<title>18BANSTEAD ROAD CHAPEL</title>
		<content>{This chapel was built in 1962 and was 
{dedicated on the 30th April, 1962.}It 
 cost Â£30,000 to build. Before it was  
 built the builders checked the ground 
 for old graves.                       
{The chapel belongs to the Mormons.    
 They do not drink or smoke or watch   
 films with swearing in them. They do  
 not have collections in their church, 
 but instead give one tenth of their   
 earnings to the church each year.     
 Only the caretaker of the chapel is   
 paid. All the rest of the money goes  
 to poor people or to building chapels 
 in other places.                      
{When the chapel was built a workman   
{found part of a skull.}It was         
 discovered to be that of a Saxon and  
 was preserved in flint. A knife,      
 brooch, shield and sword were also    
 found with the body.
