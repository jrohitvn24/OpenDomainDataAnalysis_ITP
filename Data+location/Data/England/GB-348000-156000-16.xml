		<title>16OUR D-BLOCK RAMBLES</title>
		<content> Class 1 had three lovely days walking 
 round parts of our D-Block. The first 
 time was when we went for an afternoon
 sketching views from the hillside     
 about{60 metres above the school.}We  
 saw nearly all of the main buildings  
 from{"The Rocks",}where we worked. We 
 were visited by some inquisitive      
 heifers, who wanted to find out who   
 was making all the noise in their     
 field!                                
 The second day we went all the way to 
 the highest point of the D-Block,     
{Beacon Batch (484573).}It was a bright
 day and when we reached the summit we 
 met a group of students from{London   
{University,}who were also doing a     
 survey of their own. They explained   
 how to use their valuable equipment.  
 Our third trip was around the village,
 sketching interesting buildings or the
 details plants growing on walls.      </content>
