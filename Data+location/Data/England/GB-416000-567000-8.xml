		<title>08A School Day</title>
		<content>   In the morning I get up at 7 go to  
 the bathroom, get washed, then I get  
 dressed and go downstairs.            
   My Mam makes my breakfast which is  
 normally "Kellogs Start" then I get my
 bag ready for school. I get the number
 7 bus at Bedeburn Road and get off at 
 Hillheads Road.                       
   I go to chapel Park Middle School.  
 The bell rings at 8.55.  We usually   
 have four lessons a day. In a week we 
 mostly have Maths., English,          
 Environmental studies, Science and    
 French, but we also have Music, Art,  
 Health, Homecraft, Craft Design       
 Technology, Games and R.E.            
   We have our dinner break from 11.55 
 until 12.55. At 3.30 the bell rings   
 for home time. When I get home I do my
 homework then I have my tea.  I play  
 outside for an hour and then watch    
 television before going to bed at 10. </content>
