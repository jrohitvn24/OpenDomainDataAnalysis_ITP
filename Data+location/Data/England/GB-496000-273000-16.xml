The first mention of May Day           
Celebrations in the School Log is in   
1887 but it does not say what they     
were.The children had a holiday on this
day.The first May Day was in 1906.It   
was not organised by the school but by 
a committee of ladies who used it to   
raise money for the Chapel's Sunday    
School treat. The children walked      
around Ringstead,Thrapston and the     
Addingtons stopping at times to        
dance around the May Pole.They had no  
instruments so the younger children    
sang Come Lasses And Lads,to help them 
to dance in time.Many of the older     
people have told us about these        
festivities.The first mention of May   
Day being held at school was in 1929.  
The May Queen was crowned in the play- 
ground.After the war May Day restarted 
in 1953 and has gone on ever since.    </content>
