   Rookery Farm is the home of{Mrs. B. 
{Cooke. }Her son-in-law,{Mr.D. Symms,  
 helps her to run the farm. It has 200 
 acres which is divded into l3 fields. 
 This is a{Dairy Farm}and has 125 cows 
 in milk and 75 calves. Mr. Symms pays 
 a visit to{Beeston Cattle Market}once 
 a fortnight to buy and sell cattle.   
   The{Milk Quota}for this farm is     
 678,000 litres per year.              
   Rookery Farm is used for the local  
 Spring{Point-to-Point Meeting}of the  
 Cheshire Hunt. During this time all   
 the cattle have to be kept inside.    
   Mr. Symms thinks the farm was named 
 'Rookery' because there was a Rookery 
 in the woods nearby.
