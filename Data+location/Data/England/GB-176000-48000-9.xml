		<title>09CHOON DAIRY-FARM,ALLET,TRURO</title>
		<content> Choon is a 116 acre farm on a south-  
 facing slope, with a dairy herd of 50 
 Friesian &amp; South Devon cows. Heifers  
 are kept as dairy-followers for       
 replacement, bull-calves are fattened 
 for beef;there are a few hens. Corn is
 grown for animal feed, with grass cut 
 for silage &amp; hay.  The buildings are  
 mostly old cob, with some modern ones 
 for storage of cattle-cake etc.  The  
 farmer, his wife &amp; son run the farm.  
 Now, in late autumn, there is time to 
 repair buildings, equipment, gates, &amp; 
 Cornish-hedges.  Today the farmer has 
 renewed a bin in the milking-parlour; 
 this evening (Friday) he is preparing 
 a sermon for Sunday at Allet Chapel   
 where he is a local preacher. The main
 problem on the farm at the moment,    
 after this week's rain, is mud in the 
 yard &amp; where fields slope to a stream.
