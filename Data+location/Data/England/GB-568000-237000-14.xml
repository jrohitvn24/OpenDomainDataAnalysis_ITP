		<title>14RECOLLECTIONS OF STAMBOURNE</title>
		<content>  {Written by an older resident who has
{lived at Moat Hall Farm for 30 years.}
  This end of the village of Stambourne
 has not altered much in the last 30   
 years, as it is called the Green Belt.
 And no houses are allowed to be built 
 here. Only farm buildings etc.        
  It is the Cornish Hall end road.     
 There is a chase up to a very old     
 house called Slough Farm. Then there  
 is Moat Hall Farm, about 150 years    
 old. Also Green Farm with an old      
 thatched roof. Opposite this is a big 
 field, once the Common belonging to   
 the village, but now ploughed up and  
 used for growing corn, etc. It now    
 belongs to Revels Farm which is a     
 little further up. This used to be    
 called Lower Green Farm. Higher up    
 there is Rockalls Farm. This was      
 called Upper Green Farm and pigs were 
 kept.                   (contd on p15)</content>
