		<content> OUR AREA IS VERY WELL SERVED BY BOTH  
 PUBLIC AND PRIVATE TRANSPORT.  THE    
 PRINCIPAL ROUTES OF THE BLOCK ARE A345
 A338, A360 AND THE STRATFORD ROAD     
 THROUGH THE WOODFORD VALLEY.  THE A345
 IS THE BUSIEST ROAD DURING THE DAYTIME
 BECAUSE IT IS THE MAIN ROAD FROM      
 SALISBURY TO AMESBURY AND THEREFORE   
 LINKS UP WITH THE A303 AND ALL ROADS  
 TO THE NORTH AND WEST.  IT IS ALSO A  
 MAJOR ROUTE TO THE MOTORWAYS LEADING  
 TO WALES AND THE NORTH OF ENGLAND.    
 BUS SERVICES THROUGH THE AREA ARE     
 ADEQUATE BUT THERE IS A POOR SERVICE  
 FOR PEOPLE LIVING IN THE WOODFORD     
 VALLEY.  THE NEAREST RAILWAY STATION  
 IS AT SALISBURY AND IS WITHIN REACH OF
 ALL PARTS OF OUR BLOCK.  SALISBURY    
 LINKS WITH ALL OTHER PARTS OF THE     
 COUNTRY AND THERE IS A FREQUENT RAIL  
 SERVICE TO LONDON.
