 We get steam engines coming.All that  
 week the village is decorated with    
 buntings.Chiltern radio and Anglia TV 
 are approached to see if they can help
 with publicity.Posters are put up in  
 St Neots and Gamlingay and nearby     
 villages.The Jolly Abbot,the local    
 restaurant,has agreed to provide      
 refreshments.After the fete there is a
 barbeque where we have Morris Dancing,
 Parachutists and Fire eaters and the  
 raffle is drawn.There is a committee  
 which organises it all.               
 The Youth club and Young farmers also 
 entertain us on different days of the 
 week,and we have a Cricket match.On   
 the Sunday there is an important      
 service celebrating St Margaret's     
 day,where successful children are     
 presented with their Chorister Blue   
 Ribbons.                              </content>
