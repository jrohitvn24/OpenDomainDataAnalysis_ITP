		<content> There are{500 people who work}at the  
 Coal Board.  This Coal Board is 37    
 years old.  One of the buildings has  
 been there since before the Second    
 World War.  446 men and 54 women work 
 there.  It does not matter if the site
 gives off much{pollution}because it is
 only dust.  They have special machines
 to collect the dust.  Most of the     
 workers live by Tewkesbury and        
 Cheltenham.  The{discoveries}over the 
 years are coke, gas, petrol and       
 diesel, nylon and aspirin. Also the   
 discovery that the glass observation  
 panel in the front of coal stoves is  
 better made from rods of glass than a 
 sheet of material then the panel does 
 not get smoked or blackened. When the 
 Miners' Strike was on, they received  
 coal from the Midland, Nottingham and 
 Sheffield coal fields.
