		<title>17Trips out from Framlingham</title>
		<content>The coast is the most popular choice   
for a day out in the Summer,with       
Aldeburgh,Sizewell and Minsmere most   
favoured. Felixstowe is within easy    
reach. For many people a shopping trip 
to Ipswich is a day out, with its new  
swimming pool a special attraction.    
Other favourite places to visit within 
the county are Easton Farm Park,       
Tunstall Forest,Kessingland Wildlife   
Park,Pleasurewood Hills Amusement Park 
and Earsham Otter Trust.Open days at   
the Air Force bases are popular, with  
boys in particular. Most people have   
been on at least one day trip to London
with coach transport often laid on by  
local firms.Other frequent coach       
excursions include Woburn Abbey,Windsor
Safari Park and Alton towers. The      
County Show, at which many local firms 
exhibit, is another Framlingham outing.
