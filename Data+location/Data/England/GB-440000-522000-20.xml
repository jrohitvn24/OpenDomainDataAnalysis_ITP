		<content> We are lucky where we live because all
 we have to do is go across Junction   
 Road and we are in the{countryside.   
 There are farms, cultivated fields    
 and sometimes you can see animals     
 grazing.We must learn to care more for
 the countryside as it is a place of   
 pleasure and enjoyment and not        
 everybody has the countryside right on
 their doorstep.{Science and Technology
 have made our environment healthier   
 and more pleasant.We live in a        
 smokeless fuel area so no house       
 chimneys emit smoke to pollute the    
 atmosphere.Nearby{industries}have     
 strict restrictions on waste disposal.
 Nontheles there is still a high incid 
 ence of chest and bronchial complaints
 complaints along with other industrial
 diseases.Improvement has been made but
 so often industrial haze caused by    
{pollution}overhangs the area.         </content>
