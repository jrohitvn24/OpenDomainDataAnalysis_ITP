		<content>   The population of Waddington is     
 about 5000. Statistics, though, are   
 confused by the presence of R.A.F.    
 Waddington between the main Lincoln to
 Sleaford and Grantham roads on the    
 heath sloping eastward from the ridge.
   The two parts of Waddington are     
 linked by the long and often steep    
 Station Road which has a sprinkling of
 good-sized brick-built homes.         
   70% of houses are privately owned   
 and less than 10% are council houses. 
   The area is surrounded by farmland, 
 chiefly arable, but there are only two
 or three farms nearby and no-one      
 considers Waddington to be a farming  
 community.                            
   There is a small industrial estate  
 in upper Waddington and many local    
 people are employed at the R.A.F. camp
 but most people work outside the      
 village, mainly in Lincoln.           </content>
