		<content>{         TORNADO HITS GOTHAM          
   In this country we dont usually     
 experience extreme weather conditions,
 such as tornadoes, but on Thursday    
 August 1984 a tornado hit our small   
 village of Gotham.                    
   It was 5.30p.m.and several people on
 their way home from work, noticed a   
 strange shape moving across the sky.  
   The older inhabitants living on the 
 edge of the village were taken        
 completly by surprise .One elderly    
 couple first noticed things flying    
 past the window pieces of wood,       
 tiles, branches, waste paper, and a   
 mass of birds.A shed roof was blown   
 off and was carried over several      
 gardens. Three garages were           
 demolished, the bricks lying in a heap
 on the road.Windows were shattered,   
 ornaments broken and glass was        
  scattered everywhere.                </content>
