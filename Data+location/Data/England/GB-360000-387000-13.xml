		<title>13WARRINGTON AMBULANCE SERVICE</title>
		<content>    The Warrington branch originated as
 a direct result of the Second World   
 War. Today it has five first line     
 ambulances, two tail-lift ambulances  
 and eight sitting ambulances. The     
 station is fully staffed for five days
 a week, with 21 staff altogether, but 
 at weekends the number can drop as low
 as 8. These are on duty for           
 emergencies only.                     
    The most common accidents catered  
 for by the station are road accidents.
 This is mainly due to the three main  
 motorways surrounding the town -      
 M6,M62 and M56, but also because of   
 the traffic congestion caused by the  
 two crossing points of the Mersey.    
    Although there are recreational    
 facilities at the Ambulance station - 
 table-tennis,pool,darts and television
 - they are not available after 6 p.m.
