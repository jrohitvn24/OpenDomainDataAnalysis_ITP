		<title>16BLACKMORE VALE DAIRY FARMING</title>
		<content> Three dairy farms occupy the whole of 
 0375/0115 which has excellent pasture-
 land.They all have milking parlours   
 and modern machinery.The milk from the
 Friesian herds goes to the Milk Market
 Board depot.Grass silage and hay are  
 made.No arable crops are grown.Local  
 stone was used for the farm buildings 
 erected on the higher land above the  
 flood levels of the River Lydden which
 crosses this area in two places.      
 Only 12 people live in this area,     
 mostly agricultural workers.All the   
 farms are a distance from the nearest 
 road but there is a weekly bus service
 between Yeovil and Blandford Forum and
 another weekly service to Sturminster.
 There are many public footpaths with  
 footbridges over the river but they   
 are little used now and hard to trace.
 This area,ideal for wildlife,has only 
 common birds,butterflies and flies.   </content>
