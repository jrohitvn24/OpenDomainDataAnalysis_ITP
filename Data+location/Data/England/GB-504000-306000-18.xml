 sports.After unusually cold and wet   
 weather we were fortunate in our      
 choice.The school photographer was    
 there to take photos of the 43        
 excited children who ran races        
 according to their ages.They took part
 in running,sack,skipping with hoops,  
 egg and spoon,3 Legged and bean bag   
 races.There were also various house_  
 team relays.In the interval, ice cream
 and orange squash was served.The      
 toddlers had their race and Mums and  
 Dads joined in obstacle races.Girls   
 and boys marathons ended the afternoon
 by which time most children had won   
 several 1st,2nd or 3rd badges.The team
