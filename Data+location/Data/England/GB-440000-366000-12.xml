		<title>12TEMPLE NORMANTON'S CHURCHES.</title>
		<content> There has been a place of worship in  
 Temple Normanton since the twelfth    
 century but it is believed the first  
 church was built in 1623. It is       
 described as a plain oblong building  
 with a clumsy wooden bell turret.     
 The second church of St. James was    
 erected in 1882 on the same foundation
 It became unsafe due to colliery      
 subsidence and was demolished in 1921.
 Coal mining had been carried out      
 within the area for over a 100 years  
 and records show nine seams beneath   
 the church itself.                    
 Again on the same site a 'temporary'  
 wooden church was built in 1923. This 
 was also affected by subsidence and   
 damaged by gales and demolished as    
 unsafe in 1982. Work on the fourth    
 church built on the same site began in
 the spring of 1985 and will be        
 completed by the end of the year.     </content>
