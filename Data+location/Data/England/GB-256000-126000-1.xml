		<title>01TAW VALLEY. BISHOPS TAWTON</title>
		<content> The area is predominately pasture land
 lying in the Taw valley just above the
 tidal high water level. The main      
 feature is the Hall estate which is   
 still run by the Chichester family as 
 it has been for centuries past. The   
 Taw river is abundan in salmon and    
 trout in these reaches. A sawmill     
 producing mainly farming requirements 
 operates at Chapelton offering some   
 alternative employment. A water       
 treatment plant is being built at     
 Herner to purify water extracted from 
 the river Taw during the frequent     
 drought conditions which affect this  
 area. The main Exeter to Barnstaple   
 single track railway passes through   
 the area with one stop at Chapleton   
 which is now an unmanned station. One 
 bus service passes through the area,  
 operating 5 services daily to and from
 Exeter. Some fields and valleys abound</content>
