tier system of education.The first is  
for children aged between 5-8 years.The
next is for children aged between 8-12 
years.When you are 12,you take an exam,
the 12+,to decide which school you will
next attend.If you pass you attend a   
grammar school and if not,you go to a  
secondary modern.When you start a
