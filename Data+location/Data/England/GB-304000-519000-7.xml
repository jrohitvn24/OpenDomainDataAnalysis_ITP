 This is perhaps the most important    
 building in the area.It is owned by   
 the Dickinson family and has been in  
 their possession since it was built in
 1822.                                 
 The original building was of sandstone
 but the more recent extensions are    
 roughcast.There have been a number of 
 alterations since John Dickinson built
 it.The original house had four rooms  
 up and four down.Mr.George Dickinson  
 added a wing on both ends and intended
 to put in bow windows but this was not
 completed because of World War One.   
 The rooms are ten feet high and cost a
 great deal to heat as a consequence.  
 Under the house is a cellar and       
 outside in the garden there used to be
 a well and a pump for the water.
