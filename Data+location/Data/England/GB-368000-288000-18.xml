		<content>     Every morning I wake up and the   
 birds are making an awful noise in    
 their nests. Then I get up to look at 
 the kittens.I give them a saucer of   
 milk, then I have breakfast.          
     After breakfast all of our family 
 share the house-work. At{8.15,}we get 
 ready for school at{8.3O}.Then my     
 brothers go to the bus stop, and I go 
 to school with my mum who teaches     
 there. At school,when the buses       
 arrive, it gets noisy. When we        
 get in to school at{9 am,}there are 24
 people in my class and 56 children in 
 the school altogether; there are three
 teachers.                             
     When I get home I feed the        
 animals. On{Monday}I go to piano      
 lessons,on{Tuesday}I go to Girl Guides
 and on{Wednesday}I go to Gymnastics   
 Club. On{Thursday}and{Friday}I have a 
 rest{!!                               </content>
