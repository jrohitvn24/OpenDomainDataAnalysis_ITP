		<content>{Ulverscroft Priory,}now in ruins,was  
 founded in 1150.It was a small August_
 inian monastic house which provided   
 welcome refuge for travellers crossing
 the forest.It was dissolved in 1539,  
 when its bell,Tomasat,was moved to    
 Newtown Linford Church,where it       
 remains.The moat and fish ponds       
 belonging to the priory have been re_ 
 excavated recently.{Beacon Hill}at 248
 mtrs is the 2nd highest point in Leics
 It may have had artificial defences   
 as long ago as the New Stone Age and  
 was certainly in use in the Bronze    
 Age,for some spearheads and other     
 artifacts have been found.As the name 
 suggests,the hill was used for beacon 
 fires,which still occur on special    
 royal occassions.{Aldermans Haw,}and  
 other places in the area named Hays,  
 Heys or Haw,were ancient hedged fields
 once surrounded by unenclosed forest. </content>
