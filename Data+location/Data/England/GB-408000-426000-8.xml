		<content> In the last century most people who   
 lived in our area also worked in the  
 area, usually at the local mill. Today
 most of these mills have closed and   
 there is very little industry. The    
 only people who live and work in the  
 area today are mostly shopkeepers and 
 farmers. The people who live in this  
 area are therefore commuters and most 
 of them travel either to{Halifax}or to
 Bradford to work. The occupations of  
 the children of Salterlee School      
 include furniture upholsterer, car    
 mechanic, woodwork machine maker, taxi
 driver, optician, jeweller, engineer, 
 printer, lecturer, welder, salesman   
 and photographer. The furthest any one
 travels to work is approximately 30   
 miles to his shop in Rotherham. Some  
 mothers have part_time jobs in the    
 many public houses and restaurents in 
 this area.                            </content>
