		<content> The area contained in this grid       
 borders on the New Forest and is      
 mainly gorse and heather broken by    
 small copses - home to a variety of   
 small wildlife-birds in particular    
 abound here, to nme a few, pheasant   
 mingle with geese which visit each    
 Autumn, Plover, all types of small    
 specis plus the ever hunting          
 Sparrow-hawks and Kestrels.  The New  
 forest Poinies and cattle owned by    
 commoners and allowed to graze by the 
 Verderers Court (yes, still today!)   
 complete the wildlife picture.  there 
 are only two villages of note 1)      
 Exbury, the home of the de Rothschilds
 - The main house is now practically   
 derelict, but the gardens are known   
 world wide for the specialist shrubs  
 and trees grown there-the village     
 houses are totally inhabited by the   
 big house staff.                      </content>
