		<title>06  St.Marys Church - Porch</title>
		<content>    This is not officially part of the 
 church as it is not considered to be  
 Holy ground.In fact in Saxon days they
 also used to have christenings in the 
{Porch}because the babies were         
 considered to be unfit to enter the   
 church before they were christened.   
    At the beginning of this century   
 bread was left on the shelves in the  
 Porch for the poor people of the      
 village, and they still take a        
 collection in the services to help    
 the poor.                             
    In olden times too,the Porch was   
 the place where legal disputes and    
 quarrels were discussed, and even     
 today legal notices should still be   
 displayed on the church door inside   
 the Porch. This door is made of thick 
 oak and is covered with hide.
