		<title>10BOLAM POST OFFICE</title>
		<content> The Bolam Post Office is only a small 
 one, it is a very neat place.  The    
 equipment used is letter and parcel   
 scales, a stapler and a stamper.  The 
 Post Office has been there for 3      
 years.  They handle about 10-12       
 letters and parcels per day. The      
 heaviest parcel weighed in the post   
 office was 11 kg.  The post man has   
 been doing mail services for 14 years.
  He delivers once a day 6 times a week
 except for Sundays.  The post office  
 is owned by Mr &amp; Mrs Beckwith.  The   
 post office was the old School House  
 but it has been made into a house.
