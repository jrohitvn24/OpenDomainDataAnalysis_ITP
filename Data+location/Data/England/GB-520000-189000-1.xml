		<content>   Our Domesday block includes two     
 areas with very different             
 characteristics.The first area        
 includes Burnt Oak and Colindale,     
 which has many shopping and service   
 facilities which cater mainly for the 
 Watling and Grahame Park Estates. The 
 area is also well known for its       
 aerodrome and flying displays of the  
 past, which featured such people as   
 Claude-Grahame White. Today,Aerodrome 
 Road has replaced the famous runway   
 and the Grahame Park Estate is built  
 on the airfield.                      
   The M1 motorway runs down through   
 the middle of our block,with the      
 second area of Mill Hill and Hendon   
 lying in its eastern half. 35% of     
 the land-cover in these areas is open 
 space,with attractive parks and a     
 well used sports centre. Hendon is the
 longest established part of our block.</content>
