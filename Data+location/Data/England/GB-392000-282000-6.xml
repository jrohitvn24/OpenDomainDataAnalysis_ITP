		<content> When they built the flats in fields   
 they shipped in people from all over  
 the place, people who had no previous 
 contact with Cradley or its history.  
 Cradley has lots of foundries and     
 factories so the smell of chemicals   
 prevail.Some of the  flats  aren't    
 very nice to look at because they've  
 been neglected for so long.They've    
 also been vandelised like so many     
 other things in Cradley.              
     There is a high school called     
 Cradley high and three primary schools
 called Caslon, Colley Lane and Cradley
 Church of England.So where ever you   
 live you are near a school.The High   
 School is being rebuilt at the moment 
 and it will have many new facilities  
 and ammenities for the community to   
 use as well as the school children.
