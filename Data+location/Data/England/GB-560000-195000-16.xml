		<title>16Mountnessing Windmill</title>
		<content> Mountnessing Windmill is a postmill   
 which dates from 1807.It is built on a
 mound and we were told this probably  
 means that an earlier mill which stood
 here was also a postmill.In the last  
 few years over 50 windmills have been 
 lost within a radius of 15 miles.Our  
 windmill has been preserved by local  
 effort.In 1956 it was sold to Essex   
 County Council for one shilling and is
 now a grade 2 building. It is         
 surprising that it is still standing  
 because when it was a home guard post 
 people thought it helped German pilots
 to navigate and threatened to demolish
 it.Later it became too expensive to   
 keep and the money it was said could  
 be better used to build a bus shelter.
 It was also damaged by lightning.By   
 the summer of 1983 restoration was    
 finally completed ,the mill was opened
 and now grinds corn on open days.     </content>
