		<content>We stopped a man in Kirkham.His name   
was Mr.Peter Wells.He was taking his   
dog for a walk as he walks to Wrea     
Green every day to see his aged        
mother.He had lived in Kirkham all his 
life.He said he had seen it change a   
lot but he would not like to see any   
more buildings or flats as he very much
liked the rural environment.He enjoys  
observing the wild life of the area.He 
said many old streets had been knocked 
down to make room for other            
buildings.For example,the old Willows  
School had been knocked down and they  
had built another new school and       
club across the road.He thought that   
the population of Kirkham had not      
increased very much.Mr.Wells works at  
the Social Services Department in      
Kirkham where he is a general handyman 
at the Training Centre.
