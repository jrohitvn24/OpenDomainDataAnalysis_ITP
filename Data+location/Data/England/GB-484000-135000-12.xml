		<content> There are books for children and      
 adults.{Young children's}books have   
 simple,{easy to read}stories. The next
 age group get harder.{Adults}books are
 usally about{gardening}and{love       
 stories. At school you read books with
 different reading levels. My friends  
 like the books that{I read}which are  
{Fighting Fantasy}books where you      
 choose where to go on to in the       
 story. For example, as you reach the  
 temple you see a path leading to the  
 west. Do you want to go along the west
 path?(turn to page 327). Or do you    
 want to go inside the temple?(turn to 
 page 64). And you get to{fight        
{creatures}by using dice. You have a   
 certain goal to make, like you must   
 find the{Warlock}and destroy him.
