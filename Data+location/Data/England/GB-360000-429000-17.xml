FROM THE SCHOOL'S OLD LOG BOOK.        
June 1931 ' The board of Education have
asked the rural schools to make a      
survey of the country immediately      
surrounding them, for the purpose of   
showing to what uses the land is put. I
recieved two ordance maps of the       
Samlesbury district, and have been     
given permission to take classes out   
during school hours to do the work of  
the survey.'                           
During the month of June 1931, the     
children of standards 11 to Vll were   
taken out for walks to different parts 
of the parish to survey the fields on  
either side of the lanes and roads.They
were provided with traced maps, and    
trees, flowers and birds were also     
observed. The children who did the     
survey would be from 7 to 13 years old.
