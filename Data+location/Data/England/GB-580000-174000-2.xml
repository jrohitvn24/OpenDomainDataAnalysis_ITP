		<content> My village is Lower Stoke.  The High  
 Street has 2 pubs which both play the 
 old Kentish game of Bat &amp; Trap. They  
 are called the Nags Head and the Ship.
 The doctor's surgery only opens on    
 Thursday mornings, a new surgery has  
 been built in Allhallows.             
 There is a newspaper shop and general 
 grocery shop with a Do_it_yourself    
 section, and a shoe shop opposite.    
 Next door is a builders office and    
 estate agent. The shop next door is   
 the new post office.  I live in Stone 
 Cottage. I attend Stoke School and    
 like it here. The pillar box is       
 outside my window.                    
 Middle Stoke and Upper Stoke are also 
 part of the village. The garage and   
 chapel are at the bottom of School    
 Hill.  The village hall is just across
 the road.
