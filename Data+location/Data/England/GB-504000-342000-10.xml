		<title>10QUARRINGTON RIDING SCHOOL</title>
		<content> The owner of the{riding school}is     
 Tessa Brown. Sue Mallinson is the head
 girl. The school is used by girls,    
 women, and occasionally some boys. It 
 opened about 10 years ago.            
                                       
 There are 24{horses.}At 7.45 Sue      
 Mallinson feeds the horses and mucks  
 out the yard. She brings the horses in
 from the fields so they do not get ill
 from eating too much grass. Then she  
 rides the horses to exercise them. In 
 the afternoon the horses are groomed  
 and their hooves are polished with    
 hoof oil. The tack has to be cleaned. 
 The horses are tacked up for the      
{lessons}at 4.30 and 5.30. After the   
 lessons the horses are untacked, and  
 taken to their stables to be fed.     
 Occasionally they have a shampoo, and 
 their coats and tails are clipped.
