		<title>07LITTLEHAMPTON TOWN</title>
		<content> Over the years Littlehampton has not  
 changed much at all.In fact it is     
 rather surprising just how much of the
 old town still remains.The eastern    
 half of East street was as it is      
 today,and is still recognisable for   
 instance the cornerstones were        
 there.There was a block of houses on  
 the site of the cinema which was built
 in 1927. there was a tailors shop     
 where the card centre is today and a  
 supply stores,a wine merchants and a  
 china shop where a supermarket now    
 stands.A bank now stands where there  
 was a hotel and the local jobcentre   
 stands upon the site of a shoe and    
 boat shop. The newsagent known as the 
 "cabin" stands upon the site of an old
 cottage called "Swiss cottage".The    
 Dolphin hotel is still there, a       
 building which was erected in 1873.
