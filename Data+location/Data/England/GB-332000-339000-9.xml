		<title>09A Turkey Farm, Sodylt</title>
		<content> This turkey farm raises 6,000 birds   
 which{only}need to be fed twice a week
 on pellet food.The owner runs the farm
 by himself and the turkeys are not    
 sold for meat but are kept for        
 breeding and the production of eggs.  
 The eggs are sold to hatcheries in    
 various parts of the country.Lorries  
 from hatcheries arrive to collect eggs
 twice a week.The main labour on the   
 farm involves packing eggs in trays of
 200.                                  
 There are 7 acres of land and the     
 birds are kept in large sheds.There   
 are runs around the sheds which give  
 protection against intruders like     
 foxes which are a menace.             
 The farm is out in the country and so 
 the noise the birds make is not a     
 nuisance to anyone.                   
 This farm is unique to the area, the  
 nearest other being over 30 miles away</content>
