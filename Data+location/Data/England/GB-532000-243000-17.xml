		<title>17HISTORY IN BASSINGBOURN</title>
		<content> The road that runs past Bassingbourn  
 is called Ermine Street. It was built 
 by the Romans around 60 A.D. Another  
 old road called Ashwell Street runs on
 the southern boundary of the village. 
  There is the site of a castle in one 
 of our areas. A man called Sir Warin  
 de Bassingbourn used to live in the   
 castle at around 1266. It was later   
 owned by John of Gaunt. Now you can   
 only see the shadow of the foundations
 from the air.                         
  The Earls of Richmond owned the manor
 from 1066. Lady Margaret Beaufort was 
 the mother of Henry Tudor (Henry VII).
 There is a Tudor tithe barn at Manor  
 Farm. In 1511 the villagers performed 
 a play about St George and the dragon 
 on St Margaret's day (July 20th).     
  There are lots of books in the County
 Library, Cambridgeshire Collection, by
 local people about Bassingbourn.      </content>
