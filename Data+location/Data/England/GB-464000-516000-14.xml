		<title>14LIFESTYLES - Gamekeeper</title>
		<content>      My{dad's a gamekeeper.}He has    
 been a gamekeeper for{15 years.}Every 
 year he gets between 400 and 800      
{pheasants.}My dad's 'boss' is called  
 Mrs. Ringrose-Wharton.                
      He has{7 dogs}and one of them has
 had 7 pup's. The{Alsation}is used for 
{tracking poachers.}The{Labradors}are  
 used for{pigeon and grouse-shooting.  
      My dad looks after the pond next 
 to De-Brus School and Skelton Beck.   
 The dangers to the pheasants are      
 poachers, foxes, weasels, and stoats. 
      Mr. Anthony Wharton is Mrs.      
 Ringrose-Wharton's son. He usually    
 helps my dad in shoots. Mr. Wharton   
 holds a{clay-pigeon shoot}every year  
 on the castle lawns.                  
      My dad is a champion at clay     
 shooting so I thought I might enter   
 this year.
