      The children who come to our     
 nursery have to be 3 years old.  There
 are 26 children in the nursery in the 
 mornings and 26 other children in the 
 afternoons.  There is one teacher and 
 one nurse.  Children in the nursery   
 play with sand and water, they paint  
 pictures, build with lego bricks and  
 make jigsaw puzzles.  The children    
 enjoy playing games.  They learn to   
 sing songs and nursery rhymes.  They  
 play percussion instruments.  When the
 weather is fine the children play out-
 side in the garden.                   
      After the children have played,  
 they have a story then have their     
 dinner.  Fifteen children stay for    
 dinner which is made by the nursery   
 cook.  Children have to be 4 years old
 to attend Nursery School all day.     </content>
