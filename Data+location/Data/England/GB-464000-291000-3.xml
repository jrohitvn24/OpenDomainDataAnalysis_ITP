		<content> FLECKNEY PRIMARY SCHOOL PAST          
 The C.ofE. primary school was built in
 1873. By then all children under 10   
 had to go to school.The 5 room school 
 had to accommodate  330 children.     
 The school was extended in 1973 due to
 the expanding village and overcrowded 
 conditions in the school. The         
 extension(larger than the original    
 building) had to be built on a new    
 estate neat the edge of the village.  
 Allthe infants remained at the old    
 building and there are no plans to    
 have the children at one site. The old
 building is considered adequate.      
 The extension itself has had mobile   
 classrooms added.                     
 This information was the result of an 
 interview with the Headteache
