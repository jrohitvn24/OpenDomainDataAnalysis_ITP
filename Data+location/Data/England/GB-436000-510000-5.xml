		<content> Piersburg Grange in Low               
 Worsall,presently the house of Mr.and 
 Mrs.Tom Kidd,was first used as an     
 inn.In 1732 it was bought by two      
 Piersburg brothers who used it as a   
 trading house.They were declared      
 bankrupt in 1780 and the house fell   
 into ruin until it was bought and     
 used as a farm until approximately 20 
 years ago when the Kidd family moved  
 in. Today Piersburg Grange is         
 certified as a listed historic        
 building. The present owners who are  
 keenly interested in the history of   
 the house are constantly in search of 
 information. They have restored the   
 ingle-nook fireplace and original door
 of the inn. The cellar,with its       
 stories of smugglers and evidence of  
 tunnels still has a well with         
 beautiful spring water that remains   
 the same level all year.              </content>
