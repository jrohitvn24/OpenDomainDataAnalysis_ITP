		<content> There is a part of this grid reference
 including a farm by a river and pits  
 used for fishing and sailing, by      
 permission of the owner occupiers.    
 The farm is run for a butchery        
 business. The abbatoir is on the other
 side of a road running through the    
 farmland. The grass is used to feed   
 sheep and cattle while waiting to be  
 slaughtered as well as for rearing    
 purposes. Some corn is grown which is 
 made into cattle feed.                
 The abbatoir has been equipped        
 according to E.E.C. standards and many
 of the sheep passing through are sold 
 in France. The remaining animals,     
 purchased in mainly local markets, are
 sold through local retail outlets.    
 Many families own a deep-freezer and  
 buy their meat wholesale, as an       
 example, in July 1985 an English lamb 
 weighing 42 lbs cost 76 pence per lb. </content>
