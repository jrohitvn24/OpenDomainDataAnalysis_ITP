		<title>12 Habitats around our School</title>
		<content> The residential development of our    
estate has provided an artificial      
environment for many birds. Blackbirds 
and Starlings nest in the school       
grounds and feed on the school fields  
and gardens.                           
 The tall trees around the nearby      
farmhouse have rooks nests and the     
birds feed from the fields and nearby  
lake area. Ladybirbs and caterpillars  
in abundance are found in the shrub    
borders by the pavements.              
 The man-made lakes nearby provide food
and home for a family of ducks. The    
food they eat is both artificial and   
natural.Swans also nest in the centre  
of the lakes and around the edges are  
the homes of water rats and an         
ant-hill.
