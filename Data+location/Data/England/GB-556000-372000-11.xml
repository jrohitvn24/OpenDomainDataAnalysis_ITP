		<title>11SALES OF HOMES</title>
		<content> Chapel St. Leonards is a small coastal
 resort ideal for people retiring from 
 their work or business and wishing to 
 buy a home by the sea. As Chapel St.  
 Leonards is only 2 hours by car from  
 the midland towns we get many people  
 moving here from Nottingham,          
 Sheffeild, Leicester and neighbouring 
 towns. The type of property they      
 usually buy is a detached modern      
 bungalow with two bedrooms, garage and
 central heating at a purchase price of
 up to Â£25,000. This type of property  
 makes up about 80% of the property we 
 sell. The other 20% being family      
 houses, guest houses or buisnesses.   
 Many of the older people who retire   
 here move back to their home towns    
 when their husband or wife dies. 17%  
 of the propertys are owned by people  
 who use them for second homes for     
 holidays.70% of Chapel are retired.   </content>
