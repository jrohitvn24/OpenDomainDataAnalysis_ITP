		<title>15A DAY IN MY HOLIDAY-10yr old</title>
		<content> On Wednesday my Dad told us to get    
 ready because we were going to        
 Salcombe for the day. On the way we   
 stopped at a pub and while Mum and Dad
 went for a drink my brother and I went
 on the swings.                        
                                       
 The first thing I did when we got to  
 Salcombe was to play in the sand      
 making sand castles. My baby brother  
 paddled in the sea. The sea was very  
 cold. After lunch we walked around the
 town looking in the shops.            
                                       
 Before we came home we bought sausages
 and chips to eat on the way home in   
 the car. I ate mine in the boot.      
                                       
 We arived home at about 10 o'clock. By
 then the babies were asleep, and I had
 slept in the car, too. We had a cup of
 tea and I went to bed.                </content>
