 Bransholme is as big as Bridlington   
 but there are fewer things to do.     
 When I moved here I did not like it.  
 I had no friends to play with and     
 nowhere to go.                        
                                       
 After a week it was much better and   
 now I have lots of friends. When I am 
 bored I go and call for them to play. 
 We go to the waste land and sometimes 
 to the woods.                         
                                       
 Soon there will be as shopping centre 
 on the estate so it will be easier to 
 shop.                                 
                                       
 I live in Ladyside Close. it is a nice
 house and a nice Close.
