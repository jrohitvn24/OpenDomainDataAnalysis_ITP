		<content> In{1900}fire engines were powered by  
 steam and pulled by horses. Water was 
 drawn from the river. Only men were   
 allowed to vote. The main road was    
 dusty and rutted with cart tracks.    
 Cars were rare. Radwell Road flooded  
 to 4 feet. Trains were lit through the
 roof by gas lamps and were steam      
 powered. Streets were gas lit. Scarlet
 fever, tuberculosis, diptheria, polio,
 smallpox and whooping cough were      
 common. In{l985}fire engines are      
 motorised and water comes from fire   
 hydrants. Anyone over the age of 18   
 may vote. The tarmaccadammed A6 is    
 full of traffic (see A6 survey).      
 Radwell Road still floods. Trains are 
 electrically lit and powered by diesel
 or electricty. Streets are            
 electrically lit. People are          
 vaccinated against diseases.
