		<title>18COLTON, STAFFORDSHIRE</title>
		<content> Colton is surrounded by farmland,     
 most of which is under grass for      
 cattle and sheep, a small proportion  
 is used for growing cereals. There are
 no factories in Colton, most people   
 work in Rugeley 2 miles away and      
 beyond. Most people from Colton travel
 by private means because there is only
 one service bus. The daily service    
 leaves Colton for Rugeley at 9.00 am  
 and returns at noon. The nearest      
 railway station is Rugeley Trent      
 Valley station and is about 1 mile    
 away - about half way to Rugeley. The 
 local trains go between Stafford and  
 Rugby. In Colton there is a primary   
 school for about 40 children. Two     
 school buses take older children to   
 the secondary schools in Rugeley. The 
 village church has 2 rectories, one   
 for the vicar (at present unoccupied),
 the other is a private house.         </content>
