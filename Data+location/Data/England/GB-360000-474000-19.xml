		<title>19A childs day - Leck area</title>
		<content> I get up at about a quarter to eight  
 and get some breakfast in the kitchen.
 Then I go and get dressed and sort out
 anything I need for school.My mum or  
 dad drives me to school at about half 
 past eight and I get to school at     
 about quarter to nine. I usually play 
 football outside or perhaps chess     
 inside depending on the weather. We   
 have assembly at nine o'clock until   
 about half past nine and then we do   
 maths. At 10.30 we have morning play- 
 time for 15 minutes.Then we might have
 free writing which is writing stories.
 We have lunch from 12 noon until 1p.m.
 Then we have science or art or geog-  
 raphy until 2.30 and then it's play-  
 time for 15 minutes. Finally we have  
 singing or drama or a story until 3.30
 when it's home time. Then usually my  
 mum picks me up and I go home and     
 watch T.V..I go to bed at 9.30p.m..   </content>
