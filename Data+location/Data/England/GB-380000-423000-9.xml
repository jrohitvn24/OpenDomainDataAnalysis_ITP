		<content> There are courses at Rossendale Ski   
 Slope for beginners and for more      
 advanced skiers with all instruction  
 under the supervision of fully        
 qualified ski instructors.All         
 equiptment hire may be included in the
 cost of such courses and many local   
 schools take advantage of such        
 facilities. In addition to such       
 courses and general public practice   
 sessions the slope also caters for    
 competitive meetings when the main    
 slope is closed for public skiing.    
 Both race meetings and freestyle      
 competitions attract entrants from    
 throughout the north of England.      
 Stephen Horrocks is the top local     
 skier. In July 1985 he is travelling  
 to Austria for two weeks training,    
 then he will carry on to Italy when he
 will represent Great Britain in the   
 aerial competition.                   </content>
