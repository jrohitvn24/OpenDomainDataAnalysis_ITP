		<title>09METHODISM BISHOP SUTTON</title>
		<content> A strong Methodist tradition exists in
 Bishop Sutton and has done so for over
 200 years. At present there are two   
 buildings connected by a corridor. The
 old church is now the church hall and 
 the newer building is the sanctuary . 
 The minister is the Revd. C.J.Fellows,
 and the membership of 43 is growing.  
 The community role extends beyond that
 to include a further 80 residents.Two 
 services are held each sunday, one at 
 11.00am and the other at 6.00pm.with  
 communion services at least twice     
 every quarter. The first Sunday in    
 each month sees a United Family       
 Service, which alternates its venue   
 between the two churches in the       
 village.The church enjoys a lively    
 fellowship and is at present raising a
 target of Â£4000 to finance rewiring in
 the church and replacing the floor of 
 the hall.                             </content>
