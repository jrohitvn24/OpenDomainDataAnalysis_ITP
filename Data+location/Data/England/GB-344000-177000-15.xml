		<title>15THE LIGHT HOUSE</title>
		<content> In Portishead on{Battery Point}there  
 was a light house.It was not very big 
 and nobody was living in it.It stood  
 all alone on the jaggedy worn-away    
 rocks.There was hardly any sea life   
 near the light house but we found two 
 dead crabs but they were only about 1 
 to 1 and a halve inches wide.But even 
 though the light house was very small 
 you could still see it when you were 1
 or 2 miles away.Most of us played near
 the light house on the rocks; and on  
 the hill,two of my friends fell in    
 the dirty mud near the sea.
