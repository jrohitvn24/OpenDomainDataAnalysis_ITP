		<content>{A Day in my Life by Richard Jackson   
 I am 11 years old and have been a     
 pupil at Cotherstone School since I   
 was 4\ years old. I live at Hayberries
 Farm and my parents own and run the   
 Rose and Crown Hotel at Romaldkirk.  I
 get up at 7.30 am wash &amp; dress and    
 have breakfast. From 8 am I watch TV  
 until 8.40 am then my Mum or Dad takes
 me to wait for my school taxi. Earlier
 my sister Juliet, who is 12 years old,
 leaves to catch her bus to Teesdale   
 Comprehensive School in Barnard       
 Castle 7 miles away.                  
                                       
 School begins at 9.00 am but many     
 children keep arriving until 9.10     
 am as 70% of the pupils travel to     
 school by taxi. There are about 50 of 
 us.                                   
                                       
                                       </content>
