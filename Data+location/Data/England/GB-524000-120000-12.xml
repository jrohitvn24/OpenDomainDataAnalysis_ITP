		<content> We eat apples at playtime. They are   
 2p. They are good for our teeth. Then 
 we go back to class until dinner. The 
 dinners are great. Today we had fish  
 fingers, jacket potatoes, beans and   
 cream buns. We play football or Chain 
 He after dinner . In the afternoon we 
 go in with the Top Juniors. I am a    
 Lowere Junior and we have our own     
 teacher in the mornings. In  T.J. we  
 do drama, singing, painting or clay,  
 or games like cricket or rounders, or 
 we go swimming in the school pool. I  
 did 25 lengths for the sponsored swim 
 and raised Â£2.50.                     
 Sometimes we go out on a visit for the
 Domesday project with somebody's Mum  
 or a teacher and we enyoy that. Domes 
 day is a great project.  We have been 
 to all sorts of places, farms and     
 workshops, talking to people and doing
 questionnaires and surveys.           </content>
