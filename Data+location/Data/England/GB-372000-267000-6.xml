		<content>{ST.MICHAEL'S CHURCH.}                 
 This church fell into decay in 1848.It
 was thought impossible to restore,so  
 it became a ruin.The old chancel of   
 the church did have a roof and the    
 only services then held there were    
 funerals. It was in such a poor state 
 that it was better to build a new     
 church than restore St.Michaels.In the
 Domesday Book a priest is mentioned,  
 so it must have been once an old {    
{SAXON CHURCH} made of mud and wattle  
 walls and a thatched roof.{NORMAN}    
 work can be seen today.The present    
 Norman arch&lt;on the south side> once   
 formed the church porch.Following the 
 Norman influence,a number further     
 alterations were made to the church up
 to the time it fell into              
 ruins.Parishioners about 25 years ago
