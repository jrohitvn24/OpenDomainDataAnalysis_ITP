		<content>    Here are some more ways in which   
 children spend their time:-           
    "In Bingham there are 3 playing    
 fields. There are swings, climbing    
 frames and tubes and football         
 posts."(11 yr. old)                   
    "I like to got to the park and     
 Ilike the swings and Ilike the        
 climbing frame." (6 yr. old)          
    "I like to go down the Linear Walk 
 because it's like a countryside - it's
 quiet. It's like a zoo. There are     
 ladybirds and rabbits and mice and    
 grasshoppers." (7 yr. old)            
    "In some of my leisure time I like 
 to play football. On Saturday mornings
 and Sunday nights I go to the Swimming
 Club. I also watch a lot of           
 television. My favourite programmes   
 are adventures like 'Airwolf' but I   
 also like some quiz games and comedy  
 programmes." (13 yr. old)             </content>
