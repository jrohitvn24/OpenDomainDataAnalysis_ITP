		<content>{RELIGION}Of 202 people interviewed at 
 Freshfield, 153 said that they had    
 religious beliefs whereas 49 people   
 hadn't. 52 people went to church once 
 a week, 16 people went about once a   
 month and 37 people went less often.  
 The most common reason given for not  
 going was not having the time. The    
 most interesting reason was given by a
 man who said that you only go to      
 church to confess sins and he'd never 
 done anything wrong!
