   The area is as yet undiscovered by  
 tourists, ands those who do visit are 
 mainly walkers.                       
   The old village school in Claxby was
 renovated in 1978 as part of the      
 Silver Jubilee celerbrations and made 
 into a youth centre. It can be booked 
 by schools and youth groups for field 
 trips and sleeps about 25 people. It  
 is known as the Viking Centre.        
   The Viking Way footpath passes      
 through the area and is a long        
 distance footpath from the Humber     
 Bridge to Oakham in Leicestershire. It
 attracts many walkers every year.
