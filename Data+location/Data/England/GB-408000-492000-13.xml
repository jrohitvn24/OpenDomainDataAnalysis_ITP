		<title>13EVERYDAY LIFE IN BELLERBY</title>
		<content>  Like most small villages in          
 Wensleydale, the population of        
 Bellerby consists of a mixture of     
 people who have lived there all their 
 lives and an increasing number of     
 incomers who find it an attractive    
 place in which to live.               
  Although the village supports a shop 
 and a post office, most people rely on
 the nearby market town of Leyburn for 
 most of their shopping with perhaps   
 frequent trips to Richmond, Darlington
 or Ripon when a larger variety of     
 goods is sought.                      
  A butcher still delivers meat to the 
 door, the travelling library visits   
 the village fortnightly and a fish and
 chip van comes on Thursdays.          
  An irregular bus service means that a
 car has become a necessity rather than
 a luxury, though many old people still
 have to rely on public transport.     </content>
