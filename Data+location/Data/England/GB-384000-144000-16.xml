		<title>16WARMINSTER'S FAMILIES OFFICE</title>
		<content> Battlesbury Barracks is a big Army    
 camp on the outskirts of Warminster.  
 To help soldiers with problems, the   
 Barracks has a Families Office,       
 the lieutenant who helps to run       
 the Office, has a lot of Army         
 experience, as he joined up when he   
 was 15 and has served for 25 years,   
 being posted all around the world. In 
 the Office he deals with soldiers of  
 all ages and with all sorts of        
 problems, from financial matters to   
 marriage problems. This work is       
 confidential. Because the             
 lieutenant travels round with the same
 Battalion and lives in the Barracks,  
 he gets to know the people well.      
 Officially his Office is open from 8  
 am to 5 pm, but he is always on call  
 to deal with emergencies, and one     
 morning he was called out at 3 am!    
                                       </content>
