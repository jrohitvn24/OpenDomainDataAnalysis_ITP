		<content> Most people where we live go to work  
 in London.This is not because there is
 no work here,the reason is there are  
 only factory jobs here.               
     My dad works in London in a bank  
 he goes by train.He has a car,but in  
 London there is nowhere to park it.   
     He leaves for work at about a     
 quarter to eight and gets home at six.
 He is usually very tired when he gets 
 home.                                 
     My mum goes to work at Purfleet   
 school where she works as dinner      
 lady.She goes to school by pushbike.  
     My mum complains sometimes because
 she thinks my dad earns more than she 
 does for doing less work.             
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
