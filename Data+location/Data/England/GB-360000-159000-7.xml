		<title>07CLUTTON PARISH CHURCH</title>
		<content>  Clutton Parish Church is named after 
 St. Augustine of Hippo. He is best    
 known because he wrote a book called  
 'The Confessions'. He was born in     
 North Africa.The tower is the only    
 remaining part of the medieval church,
 mentioned in the Domesday Book.It is  
 19.5 metres tall. In 1865. Rev.       
 Johnstone the Rector, rebuilt the main
 part of the church. The famous actor, 
 Henry Irving, has connections with    
 Clutton. Members of his family the    
 Brodribbs are buried in the           
 churchyard.When it was Christian Aid  
 week, all the children in the school  
 went down to see a hut made of        
 cardboard  and tape in the churchyard.
 It was built to show us the kind of   
 house that children in the {Third     
{World}countries often have to live in.
 We managed to squash 12 girls in it.  
 We would not like to live in it.      </content>
