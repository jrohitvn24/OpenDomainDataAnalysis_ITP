 WORLD WAR WHEN IT WAS USED AS A BASE  
 FOR NIGHT FIGHTERS AND BOMBERS.THE    
 SORT OF PLANES THAT USE THE AIRFIELD  
 TODAY ARE LIGHT AIRCRAFT AND          
 GLIDERS.THE AIRFIELD IS NOW RUN BY THE
{CORNISH GLIDING CLUB.}THE AIRFIELD IS 
 BUSIEST DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS WHEN 
 THE UPDRAFT FROM THE CLIFFS AND THE   
 THERMAL AIR CURRENTS ARE BEST FOR     
 GLIDING.THERE ARE THREE SERVICEABLE   
 RUNWAYS,THE LARGEST IS THREE QUARTERS 
 OF A MILE LONG.THE GRASS LAND AROUND  
 THE RUNWAYS IS USED BY LOCAL FARMERS  
 TO GRAZE CATTLE.MANY PEOPLE PARK THEIR
 CARS ON THE NEARBY ROAD WHILST THEY   
 WATCH THE GLIDERS TAKING OFF AND      
 LANDING AT THE AIRFIELD.
