		<title>17Home Life</title>
		<content>   My house is a terraced house. I     
 live in Rochdale. I have lots of      
 friends at school, at mosque and      
 around my home. My house is neat and  
 tidy. Most of the time I eat          
 chappatties with lamb. My mum makes   
 triangular-shaped things called       
 samosas. Sometimes my mum makes       
 fishfingers, beans and chips. I enjoy 
 them very much.                       
   My favourite games are Bull Dog,    
 Ball Tig, Bottle of Poison and other  
 fairytale games like Golden Girl, the 
 Magic Worm and the Weather Witch. I   
 like the way my mum designs and makes 
 my clothes.                           
   I am a girl. I am ten years old. I  
 was born in Pakistan and I came to    
 live in England when I was three years
 old.
