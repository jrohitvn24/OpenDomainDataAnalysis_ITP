		<title>10SUMMER FAYRE 1985 HAXBY</title>
		<content>} Summer Fayre day 1985 was on 29th    
 June at Headlands County Primary      
 School, Haxby, near York.It is        
 organised by the school and its Parent
 Teacher Association.                  
  The first thing we had to do was to  
 sell programmes, they cost 20 pence   
 each.I helped my Mum and Dad they were
 on the Treasure Island stall, people  
 had to stick a flag where they thought
 the treasure was hidden. My brother   
 helped on the goldfish stall.         
  There were lots of other attractions 
 including:-                           
 Toys,Darts,Candy Floss, Hoop-La,      
 American Bar,Lucky Dip,Bouncy Castle  
 and Swing Boats.                      
  The Army 2nd Signal Division brought 
 a lot of equipment and there were     
 Karate and Gymnastics displays.       
  A very action packed Summer Fayre    
 raised over Â£1000 for school funds.   </content>
