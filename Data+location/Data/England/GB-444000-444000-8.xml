		<title>08 MATTHEW KNIGHT'S SATURDAY</title>
		<content>      I wake up to the sight of my     
 naughty pin up calendar.  On a        
 Saturday I tumber out of bed and if I 
 have time I read a Paddington book. As
 soon as I make a noise my little dog  
 called Tiny will rush upstairs to see 
 me.  I don't fancy breakfast on       
 Saturdays, so I plonk myself down in  
 an armchair to watch TV. After a      
 sandwich lunch we go shopping to      
 Wetherby and I buy 3 cans of coke. I  
 think coke makes me run faster - its  
 the fizz in it.                       
                                       
      On Saturdays I ride my BMX bike  
 and in the evening my young lady comes
 to see me while mum and dad go out    
 drinking. Sometimes we get a video or 
 watch TV. When I get a wash at bedtime
 there's always hairs in the sink from 
 my dad and toothpaste all over.  The  
 loo always needs flushing too!        </content>
