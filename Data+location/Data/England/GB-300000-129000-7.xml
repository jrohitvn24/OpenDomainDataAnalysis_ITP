 There are three pubs within a two mile
 radius but only one of these is in    
 this Domesday area.                   
 The pub at Ralegh's cross in the area 
 to the north also serves meals but    
 to find a restaurant you have to go   
 further afield, even as far as        
 Taunton.                              
 There is sailing on Wimbleball lake to
 the west but not on Clatworthy. The   
 area around Clatworthy being used now 
 only by anglers and ramblers; riding, 
 swimming and dogs are not permitted   
 within the boundary for fear of       
 pollution.                            
 There is a Young Farmers Club in      
 Brompton Regis and scout and guide    
 movements in Wiveliscombe. In Huish   
 Champflower there is a cricket club,  
 playgroup, womens institute and NFU   
 group.                                </content>
