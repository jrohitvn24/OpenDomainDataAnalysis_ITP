		<title>10Social Concerns</title>
		<content> There are many social concerns        
 apparent in Chelmsley Wood.           
 Hooliganism and graffiti have become  
 continuous problems for its residents.
 These have been accentuated by the    
 nationwide problem of unemployment. As
 a result glue sniffing amongst all    
 ages has become common and even drug  
 abuse is widespread. The people of and
 around Chelmsley Wood are promoting   
 efforts to save the Green Belt. It is 
 also quite apparent that old age      
 pensioners and the mentally and       
 physically handicapped have concerned 
 the people. Many activities are       
 organised through church societies and
 social clubs. Housing is also a major 
 concern with many flats and           
 maisonettes being demolished and newer
 houses replacing them. Residents also 
 believe that road safety should be    
 improved.                             </content>
