		<content>Many people have lawn mowers,electric  
kettles,Hoovers and cookers. Very few  
people have waffle makers,fans,metal   
detectors,slow cookers and electric    
polishers. Most people have a          
radio,camera,T.V, and calculator.      
Surprisingly few people have a         
computer,video or hi-fi.Only 10 people 
out of 40 have a computer. Most people 
heat their homes with electricity or   
solid fuel. There are only 5 homes that
are heated by oil.                     
The Radio Station.                     
This was started in 1926.It is still   
being used but they are clearing the   
transmitters out of the wings to make  
bedrooms for the students at the       
college.Several radio stations are     
being closed and some of the workers   
are moving to Stow-on-the-Wold.
