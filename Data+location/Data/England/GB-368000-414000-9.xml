		<content>   The area has three centres for      
 sporting activities, a cricket club, a
 sailing club, and a golf club. The    
 Church Community Centre in the old    
 school provides facilities for dances,
 ballet tuition, amateur operatics and 
 drama, church groups, and uniformed   
 organisations.                        
  There is a park, with tennis courts, 
 a bowling green, and play facilities  
 for younger children.                 
  There are four public houses, three  
 of which serve meals, and two         
 restaurants.                          
  Both schools have playing fields     
 which provide for children's sporting 
 activities, although there is concern 
 over the lack of facilities for young 
 people.
