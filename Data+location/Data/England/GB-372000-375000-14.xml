		<title>14ST.PETERS CHAPEL, TABLEY</title>
		<content> ALTOGETHER THERE HAVE BEEN THREE      
 CHAPELS ON THE TABLEY ESTATE,DURING   
 THE TIME THAT IT HAS BELONGED TO THE  
 LEICESTER-WARREN FAMILY.              
 ST PETER'S CHAPEL WAS ORIGINALLY BUILT
 ON AN ISLAND IN A PIECE OF WATER KNOWN
 AS"THE MOAT."                         
 THE CHAPEL BECAME UNSAFE              
 BECAUSE OF THE SALT MINING IN THE     
 DISTRICT AND SO IT WAS MOVED AND      
 REBUILT CLOSE TO TABLEY HOUSE.PARTS OF
 THE OLD MANOR WERE BUILT IN WITH      
 THE CHAPEL,WHEN IT WAS MOVED. THIS    
 PART OF THE CHAPEL IS KNOWN AS THE OLD
 HALL ROOM.THE FIRST FIREPLACE FROM THE
 OLD HALL IS IN THIS ROOM,TOGETHER WITH
 THE STAINED GLASS WINDOWS FROM THE    
 BANQUETING HALL.THESE WINDOWS DEPICT  
 THE COATS OF ARMS OF MEMBERS OF THE   
 LEICESTER FAMILY AND MEDALLIONS       
 DEPICTING SOME OF THE ENGLISH KINGS   
 AND QUEENS.                           </content>
