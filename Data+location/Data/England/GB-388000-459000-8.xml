		<title>08Customs in Malhamdale</title>
		<content> Customs connected with{Kirkby Malham  
{Church}include beating the parish     
 bounds,and distributing the Poor      
 Share.This is a piece of land which   
 was donated to the church about 250   
 years ago.It is let on a yearly       
 basis,and the proceeds are given to   
 the poor of the parish.               
 Rogation Sunday is still celebrated   
 when all the churches of the dale,of  
 all denominations,meet to bless the   
 land and ask for its fruitfulness.    
 When there is a wedding at the        
 church,the children of the dale tie up
 the lych-gates,and the best-man must  
 throw money over the gates to persuade
 the children to let them out.         
 Every June,sports are held in{Hanlith 
{Park}followed by a party tea for the  
 children in{Kirkby Malham Village     
{Hall. }                               
                                       </content>
