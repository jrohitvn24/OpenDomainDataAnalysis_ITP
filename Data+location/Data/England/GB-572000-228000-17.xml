		<content>     {Hazel,}daughter of{Cherry}and{Roy
{Threadgold}was born Apr.'82. (see p14)
 At 2 months she was diagnosed as brain
 damaged and in Feb.'84 she was taken  
 to the{British Inst. of Brain Injured 
{Children,}in{Somerset.}This charity   
 provides parents with a programme to  
 stimulate and aid development. The    
{Braintree and Witham Times}appealled  
 for help for the family and 300 people
 responded. Fund raising events were   
 organised, donations given and a trust
 fund set up. The programme began and  
{Hazel}goes to{Somerset}every 4 months.
      Now about 170 people come once a 
 fortnight. 3 come to each of 5        
 daily 90 min. sessions. There have    
 been changes but many of the original 
 helpers still come. Not all are local.
 Some come from{Yeldham, Earls Colne   
 and{Hatfield Peverel.}It is good that 
 people care and want to help{Hazel.   </content>
