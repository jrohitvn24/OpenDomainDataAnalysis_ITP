               1971  1981  1985 (est)  
 BISHAMPTON     547   634   620        
 THROCKMORTON   149    90   130        
  These trends in population can be    
 attributed to the fact that house     
 prices in Bishampton were reasonable  
 and 2 new housing estates were built  
 in the late 1960's, resulting in many 
 young families moving into the area.  
 In the 1980's the rise in housing and 
 transport costs has accelerated until 
 nowadays few young people can afford  
 to buy houses here and the rural      
 population is becoming older.         
  In Throckmorton the closing down of  
 the air field in 1978 caused many     
 service personnel to move away leaving
 the airfield houses empty until they  
 were sold cheaply in 1985 again       
 bringing young families to            
 Throckmorton.                         </content>
