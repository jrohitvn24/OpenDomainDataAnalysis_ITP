		<content>There is little employment in Oakamoor 
and people travel to Bolton's at       
Froghall,Britsh Industrial Sand,JCB at 
Rocester or into the Potteries or Leek.
People must travel to Alton or Cheadle 
to visit a doctor.There is a butcher's 
shop,a general store,a Post Office and 
a Blacksmith.Newspapers are delivered. 
People travel to Cheadle or further for
most of their shopping.There is our    
village school but older children      
travel to Cheadle to Secondary school. 
 The Picnic Area attracts many visitors
and canoeists hold events on the river.
The Admiral Jervis offers bed and break
-fast and a licensed restaurant and    
this year barn accomodation and tea    
rooms have opened.Alton Towers traffic 
is routed through the village.
