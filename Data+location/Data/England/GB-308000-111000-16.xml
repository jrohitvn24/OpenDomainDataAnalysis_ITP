		<content>           While most people think of  
 the village as expanding Mr. and Mrs. 
 Coles think Culmstock has shrunk!They 
 remember a time when there were five  
 sweet shops,two bakers,a shoe mender, 
 a blacksmith,a doctor and a nurse in  
 the village.There were also some      
 strong rules about keeping the village
 tidy.For if Mr Collier,the Lord of the
 Manor, found anything had been thrown 
 in the river there would be trouble.  
 Boys haven't changed much however and 
 Mr. Coles remembers lots of mischief  
 he got up to as a youngster.He also   
 had to help at home and on Sundays he 
 was expected to go to church and      
 Sunday school.There were times when he
 dodged out of going and if his father 
 found out he would get strapped.One   
 thing that has improved are the roads 
 as these were rough stone and riding a
 bicycle would lead to many punctures. </content>
