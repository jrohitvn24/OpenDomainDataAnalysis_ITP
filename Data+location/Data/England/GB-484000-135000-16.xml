		<title>16Horse Riding</title>
		<content>      When I  was six I went Horse     
 Riding.                               
      On the{first day}I was given a   
{hat}and taught how to{brush}my horse, 
 it was{hard work.}My horse was called 
 Silver Streak, it was a girl and it   
 was four years old.  I liked horse    
 riding but I left because I{fell off  
 and landed in{stinging nettles}and I  
{broke my wrist}and I had lots of{cuts 
 and{bruises}and they{hurt a lot.      
      But now, in 1985, I would love to
{start again,}Mum said I might be able 
 to start but it costs a lot of money. 
 I would{love a horse}and I hope one   
 day that I have a horse or pony of my 
 own which I will feed and look after  
 myself but I would have to have a     
 bigger garden.                        
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
