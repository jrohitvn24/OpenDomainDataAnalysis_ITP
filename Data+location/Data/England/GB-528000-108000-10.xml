		<title>10THE BRIGHTON BYPASS</title>
		<content>  Most people were against the         
 bypass.The main reasons being that it 
 would destroy much of the Downland    
 landscape,Patcham Court Farm would be 
 cut off from its farmlad and that it  
 would increase the noise level        
 considerably in the Makie Avenue area.
  Not all the interviewies were against
 the bypass.The main advantages thought
 to be less cars using residential     
 streets to avoid congestion  on the   
 main roads,it would remove East-West  
 traffic from the Town Centre and that 
 it would reduce accidents by 10%.     
  Most people knew how the bypass would
 effect them and this information came 
 from the newspapers,the radio or      
 visiting the Town Hall.The majority   
 felt that the Â£50 million bill would  
 not be money well spent.
