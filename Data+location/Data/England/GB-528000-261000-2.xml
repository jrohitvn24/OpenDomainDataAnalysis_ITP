		<title>02History of Papworth Everard</title>
		<content> In 1918 Dr. Pendril Varrier-Jones     
 (Cambidgeshire's Officer for TB) with 
 financial help from well-wishers      
 purchased the Papworth Estate. He     
 wished to build a village where TB    
 sufferers could live and work as      
 valued members of the community along 
 with their families. This work        
 developed and became known inter-     
 nationally.                           
                                       
 As TB was gradually  eliminated,      
 the trust began to turn its attention 
 to handicapped people, and this is the
 field in which it now specialises.    
 Half of the inhabitants of Papworth   
 are there because of their handicap   
 and now live very full lives.
