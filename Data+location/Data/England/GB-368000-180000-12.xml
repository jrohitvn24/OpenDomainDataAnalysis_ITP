		<content> Yate has become much bigger in the    
 last twenty years.A village has grown 
 into a new town.There is more traffic 
 on the main roads and the shops are   
 busy on Thursday and Friday evenings  
 and on Saturdays.Apart from a few     
 trees the area was very bare.Now the  
 gardens are full of trees,shrubs and  
 flowers and the pathways are          
 surrounded by grass.                  
     At one time Yate was full of young
 married couples and young families,now
 there are more older people here.     
     The facilities are better now.    
 There is a sports centre,parks,new    
 schools  and a big shopping centre.   
     New houses are continually being  
 built and the industrial estates are  
 getting larger.
