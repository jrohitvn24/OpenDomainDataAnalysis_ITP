		<title>11BARNSTAPLE JUNCTION STATION.</title>
		<content> Barnstaple had three{stations}once.   
 Nowadays it has one,the Barnstaple    
 junction{station.}It was opened in    
 1854.The first diesel service started 
 in 1964,before then all trains ran on 
 steam. At present the{station}has     
 eleven trains every week day.The line 
 goes from Barnstaple to Exeter        
 stopping at eleven village{stations}on
 the way.It is mostly single track     
 although there are double tracks laid 
 these are not used.Another line went  
 from Barnstaple to Bideford but the   
 track was taken up in 1985 because it 
 was considered uneconomical. This line
 may now be used as a footpath or cycle
 track.A British rail employee believes
 that the loss of this line will lead  
 to inconvenience and unemployment and 
 will put more cars on the road.The    
 line to Exeter is also threatened     
 which would be a more serious blow.   </content>
