 Rodmarton Manor and adjoining grounds 
 cover 7 acres. The house has eight    
 principal rooms and a private chapel. 
 The gardens are open to the public 26 
 times a year and the house 6 times.   
 The house was built between 1909-1926 
 by local craftsmen. The furniture is  
 all hand made. The present owner has  
 been there 30 years and now lives     
 alone. There are 6 tenants in         
 adjoining flats. Water comes from a   
 400 ft well. The same supply is pumped
 to Rodmarton &amp; Culkerton. There is    
 mains electricity and bottled gas.    
 There are open wood fires and central 
 heating. 2 are employed part time in  
 the house, 4 full time in the garden. 
 Roses, peonies, hostas, snowdrops,    
 helibores and wistaria grow well.     
 There is a swimming pool in the       
 grounds.                              </content>
