<title>42Day in the Life</title>
<content>

On Saturday me and my mum went to Eltham, I needed to get some more school shoes. When we came home I had lunch, then I played on my Xbox and I played a game called Halo Reach and you are this person and you shoot aliens and elites and you have teammates that help you. At four o'clock I went with my mum to take my brother Tyler to his friends house for a sleepover. and I played with them for an hour. On the way home my mum got me McDonalds, then me, mum and dad all watched a film together [ST Trinians]. Then I went to bed.   &lt;br />
