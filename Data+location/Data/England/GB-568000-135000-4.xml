		<title>04KILNDOWN C.E. PRIMARY SCHOOL</title>
		<content>   Kilndown School was built of        
sandstone from the Quarry opposite. It 
was opened by Louisa, Viscountess      
Beresford, on Saint Bartholomew's Day, 
24th. August, 1846. It is now a Church 
of England Aided Primary School.       
   There are now two classes, infants  
and juniors. The head teacher,         
Mr. Denton, also teaches the juniors.  
Mrs Batchelor teaches the infants, but 
is retiring at the end of this term.   
Mrs Doswell teaches part time, for one 
and a half days a week, with the       
juniors. The school has a computer     
with disc drive and we use another     
belonging to Mr. Denton. There are two 
classrooms, a hall, and a room for     
library, T.V. and computers. There are 
32 children in the school. The six     
fourth years move on to Angley School  
next term.
