		<title>06Woodland in Woodhalls</title>
		<content> The area is fortunate in having a lot 
 of woodland.The hedgebanks,many of    
 them 8ft.high,are tightly packed with 
 a variety of species:hazel,holly,will-
 ow,ivy,oak,ash and hawthorn.Along the 
 banks mature English oaks have been   
 allowed to grow up.Trees also follow  
 the water courses.There are a large   
 number of woods and copses,           
 particularly to the north of the      
 area and also on part of the Broomford
 Manor estate at Jacobstowe.The woods  
 are privately owned, not managed      
 commercially,but for household        
 purposes.The woods are predominantly  
 deciduous  woodlands, mainly oak but  
 also including common ash, silver     
 birch, willow, alder, beech, horse -  
 chestnut and sycamore.Due to Dutch Elm
 disease the English elm has sadly     
 gone.There are some coniferous        
 plantations at Jacobstowe.            </content>
