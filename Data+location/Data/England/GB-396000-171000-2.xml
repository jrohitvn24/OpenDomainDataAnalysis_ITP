		<title>02Discovering Oxygen at Calne.</title>
		<content>    The famous chemist Joseph          
 Priestley did experiments at Doctor's 
 Pond in Calne.                        
    This bend in the River Marden owes 
 its name to Priestley's practice of   
 collecting gasses that bubble up      
 through the water at this place.He    
 invented Soda water,and prepared new  
 gasses,especially Oxygen,and new forms
 of apparatus for handling gasses,1774.
 He himself called Oxygen              
 DEPHLOGISTICATED air.                 
     Priestley entered the service of  
 Lord Shelburne in 1773 at Bowood      
 Estate near Calne.He lived in Calne   
 for 7 years. His job was librarian at 
 Bowood and tutor to the Shelburne     
 sons.                                 
    Priestley's written work is called 
 "Experiments and Observations on      
 different kinds of Air".              
    He was awarded the Copley Medal.   </content>
