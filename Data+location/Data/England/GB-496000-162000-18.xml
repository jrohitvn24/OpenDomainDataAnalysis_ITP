 pick him up. When we get home we have 
 a quick snack for{lunch.              
                                       
 Then my brother and I go to our rooms 
 and we do our{homework.}When we have  
 finished we put on some old clothes   
 and go and help{Mummy}in the{garden.  
 At 4.30 I go into the house to make a 
 drink for everyone. My brother and I  
 watch{television.
