		<title>17Pets at Cottesmore</title>
		<content> My name is Nina Ball, I have lots of  
 pets but I am only writing about 3 of 
 them: 2 Guinea pigs and my Dog.My dog 
 is called Diamond, she has three walks
 a day, one in the morning at about    
 6 o-clock and one at about 9 o-clock  
 at night.She has a lead, a ball, a    
 brush and comb, a box and 2 bowls; one
 for water and one for food. We feed   
 her once a day, just before her       
 evening walk. She gets no titbits     
 apart from some chocolate drops when  
 she has been good.She loves children  
 and even if robbers were there she    
 would lick them.When she sees another 
 dog or cat she always chases them.    
 My guinea pigs are called Sooty and   
 Scruffy.They are fed morning and      
 night.Their cages are in my Dads      
 shed.We clean them out every week.They
 tip their bowls over, so they have    
 dried food all over their cages.      </content>
