		<content> Radio and television are the most     
 popular ways of obtaining news &amp;      
 entertainment. Virtually all          
 households have television, colour    
 sets being on the increase. As well as
 BBC, local Independent TV programmes  
 are transmitted from Norwich. Radio   
 sets are mostly portable &amp; frequently 
 used outside the home. Tractors are   
 often fitted with headphonesto reduce 
 boredom when working in the very large
 fields in this area. There are        
 broadcasts from local radio stations  
 in Ipswich, Norwich and Bury St.      
 Edmunds. The village shop supplies    
 daily papers to most of the           
 inhabitants, the local East Anglian   
 Daily Times and the Eastern Daily     
 Press being the most popular.         
 Magazines are supplied to order       
 ranging from Farmer's Weekly to       
 women's books &amp; children's comics.    </content>
