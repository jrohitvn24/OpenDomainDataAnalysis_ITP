		<title>20FARM LABOURERS REVOLT</title>
		<content> The inn has always been a meeting     
 place of the villagers.In 1830 farm   
 labourers gathered outside the'Red    
 lion 'to protest against their low    
 wages.They were spurred into action by
 hearing that King Charles X had fled  
 from France in the face of angry farm 
 labourers there.He had taken refuge   
 with the Weld Family at Lulworth      
 Castle.The local magistate,James      
 Frampton,read the Ript Act and three  
 people were arrested.Four years later 
 James Frampton was to play a key role 
 in the imprisonment of six farm       
 workers at Tolpuddle.                 
 During recent years this area has     
 atrracted the interest of the media.  
 Some of the B.B.C.'s Hardy's 'Wessex  
 Tales'were filmed here,as was part of 
 the major film'far from the Madding   
 Crowd'.
