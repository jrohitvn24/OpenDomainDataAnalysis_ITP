		<title>08FARMING</title>
		<content>{Arable farming}is mainly north east of
 the village of Sibson and the two main
 crops are barley and wheat.They  are  
 harvested by combine harvester which  
 unloads the crop direct onto trailers 
 it is then transported to the farm.   
 Crops average about 3.5tonnes to the  
 acre.Straw is either baled by large   
 round balers or square baled.If the   
 straw is not required to help the     
 mixed dairy sector then it is burnt to
 enable maximum use of the potash for  
 the following years crop.             
 A small partly mechanised farm at     
 Sibson uses a binder for harvesting   
 about 6 acres the crop is then stooked
 and thrashed. Three cows are hand     
 milked for the house and the rearing  
 of calves.
