		<content> The landscape is determined by        
 soil-type. On the ridge to the south  
 sand and gravel extraction leaves     
 pits, which are surrounded by         
 heathland, with heather, gorse,       
 bracken, small conifers and birches.  
 In parts this heathland slopes down   
 into bog, in others into conifer,     
 rhododendron and birch copses with    
 lines of deciduous trees. The valley  
 lies between the small rivers, Bere   
 Stream and Piddle, and is chalk-based 
 with blackthorn, hazel, hawthorn and  
 holly, scrub, ancient oakwoods, fine  
 ash, beech and chestnut trees. Willows
 edge the water. Much of the valley is 
 grassland, some damp meadows with     
 clumps of rushes. Buildings include a 
 modern Golf Clubhouse, old farm       
 buildings, cottages of brick or cob   
 and thatch, a small Victorian Chapel  
 and a l9th century mansion.           </content>
