		<title>02Land Cover Survey</title>
		<content>  The land cover survey in the whole of
 our area showed that crops were the   
 primary use for land cover.Our area   
 has 16 farms and is rural with little 
 industry.Crops such as wheat,barley   
 and oats are grown.Some farms keep    
 cattle and sheep.The secondary land   
 use on our survey was grassland most  
 of which was used for grazing for     
 cattle and sheep.                     
                                       
 There is very little woodland         
 covering,and it is mostly deciduous.  
                                       
 There are no large rivers running     
 though our area.There is Formarke     
 Reservoir nearby which supplies our   
 area with water.                      
 There are no coal mines actually      
 situated in our area but there are    
 several coal mines in the surrounding 
 area.                                 </content>
