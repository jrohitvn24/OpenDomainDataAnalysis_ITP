INTERVIEW WITH THE HOSPITAL            
ADMINISTRATOR AND SENIOR DOCTOR        
 The Royal Northern Hospital has been  
running since 1856.Today it has        
approximately 200 beds and 11 wards.   
It employs 1000 staff.                 
 The hospital has no casualty,maternity
or special units (e.g.children).These  
are in another hospital nearby-the     
Whittington.Between them the two       
hospitals work like an ordinary general
hospital.                              
 The Royal Northern has a large unit   
for sexually transmitted diseases,the  
only one in this area.There is also a  
unit for genetical diseases.These      
mainly effect Mediterranean people     
of whom there are a large group in this
area.This hospital uses a relatively   
new type of treatment using lazers for 
gynaecology.                           </content>
