 canal. Some children go horse-riding, 
 roller skating or going to the playing

 are others who prefer quieter things  
 like reading or watching television.

 place to go for squash, tennis,       
 snooker and swimming. Some boys like  
 to go out on a B.M.X bicycle.  Cricket
 is played on the cricket field.
