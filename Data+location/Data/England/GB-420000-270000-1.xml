 The area is typical of rural Warwick- 
 shire,a scatter of{small villages,}in 
 sharp contrast to the nearby          
 cities of Birmingham and Coventry.    
 Land use is mainly{agricultural.}Most 
 is intensively managed grass for use  
 as{pasture, silage or hay.}The        
 secondary land cover is cropland -    
 mainly barley and wheat.{Sheep}are the
 most common grazing animals,with      
 cattle as the next. There are several 
{woodland}areas, predominantly         
 deciduous, e.g.Haywood, but some      
 coniferous, e.g.Clattylands Wood.     
 The few{amenities}are concentrated in 
 the villages.Baddesley Clinton offers 
 most:a primary school, a Post Office  
 and food shop,an antique shop,an inn- 
 "The Orange Tree",a restaurant,a farm 
 selling "Pick Your Own" strawberries  
 and a historic manor house.           </content>
