		<content>{Yard and school games.                
 At playtime we play Bull-dogs and     
 Longball.In Longball there is a       
 bowling team and a batting team.The   
 batting person runs and the bowlers   
 have to try and hit the batter on     
 his/her leg with the ball.            
  In Bull-dogs two people are choosen  
 to go in the middle.They then choose  
 between them a person to try and make 
 a'bulldog' by running across the      
 pitch.The people in the middle have to
 try and stop the runner by picking    
 them up.If they get through then the  
 runner shouts: "Bull_dogs!".We also   
 play Polo,Chaingame,5-10 and other odd
 games. In 'Polo' there is one person  
 who says:"All different kinds of      
 flowers" or some other subject.Then   
 some people at the other end choose a 
 flower,and the guesser also has to    
 choose the name of a flower (contd.)  </content>
