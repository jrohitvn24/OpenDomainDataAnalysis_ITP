 The area covered by the grid is made  
 up mainly of well cultivated          
 grassland crisscrossed by narrow      
 country lanes with the high hedges    
 associated with the Devon             
 countryside. The main A39 Trunk road  
 passing through the area connects     
 North Devon's two most important towns
 and is subsequently very              
 busy, especially in summer as the     
 surrounding area relies heavily on    
 tourism. A ribbon development of      
 housing has taken place along this    
 road consisting mainly of post war    
 properties. The farms and hamlets are 
 much older. The area lies adjacent to 
 the low lying area of the River Taw   
 but rises steeply to over 400 feet    
 with many steep sided valleys.{
