		<title>14TRANSPORT IN GOXHILL.</title>
		<content> There are only two roads to the south 
 out of the village - one of these had 
 a gated, manned level crossing which  
 was recently replaced by an automatic 
 crossing. A traffic census, carried   
 out in the late morning of a Wednesday
 in July, confirmed that the majority  
 of lorries entering the village by    
 Thornton Road - the main access road -
 left within a short time. Cars left   
 the village but returned after a short
 time. There are only two bus services;
 the Barton-Immingham, Grimsby service 
 only skirts the village; the other    
 service is run by Humberside Technical
 Services Department using school buses
 which transport children to secondary 
 school in Barton. During the day this 
 service runs to Barton from Goxhill,  
 Barrow and New Holland but is very    
 poorly used. The village's isolation  
 makes people rely on their own cars.  </content>
