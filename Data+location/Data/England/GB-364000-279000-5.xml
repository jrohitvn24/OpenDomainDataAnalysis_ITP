		<title>05VILLAGE HALL.</title>
		<content>  The Village Hall is the hub of the   
 area's life, with it's own management 
 committee and caretaker. The Parish   
 Council's seven members meet there    
 monthly and hold an Annual Wine and   
 Cheese open Meeting for the           
 electorate. The Village Hall is run by
 a dedicated committee and the Hall is 
 used regularly by the Play Group,     
 Women's Guild, the PTA, Youth Club and
 for private functions and dances.     
  Every April for three nights the     
 Village Hall Variety Show is          
 presented, displaying a wealth of     
 local talent, now in it's tenth year. 
 The traditional Harvest Supper is held
 each October and a very popular Fur   
 and Feather Whist Drive each December.
 The PTA organises an Annual Fete and  
 Show in August. An extension was added
 in 1984. Each year an Oreton Charities
 team enters Bridgnorth Sponsored walk.</content>
