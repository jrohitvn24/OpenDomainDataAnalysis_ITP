		<title>11The River Medina.</title>
		<content>  The River Medina is the main river in
 the Isle of Wight. It roughly bisects 
 the island, hence the name. It rises  
 in the south of the island near Chale 
 Green and flows through the Wilderness
 and on to Newport the main town.There 
 is a quay at Newport where boats come 
 in. The river flows into The Solent at
 Cowes.We measured the river on the map
 and it is approximately 10.5 miles    
 (17 Km.) There is a new Industrial    
 Estate by the river and the remains of
 the old railway sidings and cement    
 mills. There is an old jetty where    
 farmers now store grain in a silo and 
 cement and coal are landed from barges
 coming up the river. The river is     
 popular for leisure activities        
 including sailing, rowing,fishing and 
 relaxing along the banks.
