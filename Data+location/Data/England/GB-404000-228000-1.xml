		<title>01THE HAILES ABBEY AREA</title>
		<content> The area is sparsely populated and    
 mainly agricultural.It has no towns or
 villages and the inhabitants live in  
 individual farmhouses and hamlets.The 
 area has been inhabited since         
 prehistoric times,and there are many  
 signs of this remaining today.They    
 include an earthwork at Beckbury      
 Camp,an Anglo_Saxon church at         
 Farmcote, a medieval abbey at Hailes  
 and farmhouses going back to Tudor    
 times.The landscape has much variety  
 and forms part of the Cotswold        
 escarpment,which runs from North East 
 to South West across the area.This    
 variety explains the range of         
 agriculture to be found in the area:  
 fruit cultivation,arable and sheep    
 farming.There has been little economic
 development and the landscape remains 
 very much as it must have been when   
 the first Domesday Book was compiled. </content>
