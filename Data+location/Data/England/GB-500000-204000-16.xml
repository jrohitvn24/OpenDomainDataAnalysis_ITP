 The hotel is built on the site of an  
 old cornmill and the waterwheel has   
 been incorporated into the design,    
 which was built 13 years ago.         
 It is a busy conference and business  
 hotel having 40 bedrooms,banqueting   
 suites for 100 people and a 50 seater 
 restaurant.Accomodation of double     
 bedroom with private bathroom,is      
 usually fully booked from Monday to   
 Thursday and conference facilities    
 Monday to Friday. This trade comes    
 mainly from the Maylands Industrial   
 Estate. August is the quietest        
 month.September to December is the    
 busiest time for conferences.         
 The pubs have little business trade by
 comparison.A few local business men   
 will come to them for a pub lunch     
 particularly during the Summer months 
 at the pub by the canal.              </content>
