		<title>04WESTMANCOTE ON BREDON HILL</title>
		<content> Westmancote is a pretty little village
 in the country.It has got many foot-  
 paths which lead to lots of exciting  
 places.Westmancote is a very quiet    
 village with{no school no post office 
{and no shops,}but in the middle of the
 village it has got a little chapel.   
 Just up the road there is a Riding    
 Stable.A Man called John Hagley owns  
 it. Some of the children in our class 
 go riding there. Some of the houses   
 are made out of Costwold Stone but we 
 have seen lots of red brick houses in 
 one little road.There are lots of     
 orchards in Westmancote.The houses in 
 the village are expensive because many
 are big.Those made out of Cotswold    
 Stone are very expensive.If you walk  
 to the top of the village there is a  
 very interesting , large, disused     
 quarry.                               
                                       </content>
