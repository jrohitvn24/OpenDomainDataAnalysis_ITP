		<title>19Profile of Streat Hamlet</title>
		<content>                                       
                                       
 The hamlet of Streat lies mainly      
 around the parish church with other   
 dwellings scattered along a narrow    
 country lane to the north and south.  
 There are no shops, but there is a    
 telephone kiosk and a post box outside
 the church. The Priest_in_Charge (of  
 Streat and Westmeston churches) is a  
 retired clergyman who uses his pension
 to supplement his salary. There are   
 l67 on the electoral roll. There are  
 no organisations connected with the   
 church; there used to be a Youth Club 
 but there are few young people now.   
 Most of the residents are retired;  a 
 few commute to London or elsewhere and
 there are very few of the farming     
 community left. There is a Women's    
 Institute in the village and a Parish 
 Meeting looks after village affairs.  </content>
