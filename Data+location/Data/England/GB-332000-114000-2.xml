   It was in the 1920's that the "Wharf
 Lane Concrete Company"was opened in   
 Wharf Lane,Ilminster,and it was in    
 1965 the factory moved and the name   
 was changed to Minsterstone (Wharf    
 Lane) Limited.                        
   Minster builds and makes such things
 as pots,bird-baths and fireplaces     
 These are made from ground            
 stone and cement which is then        
 moulded.It looks like stone but does  
 not need to be carved as it has       
 already been shaped in the moulding   
 process.In Minsterstone they make     
 models of animals, birds and of       
 people.Minsterstone is quite a big    
 factory.140 people work there.The     
 average price of a fireplace is from  
 Â£322-Â£1000 and some are even over     
 Â£1600.They export to America and they 
 sell to all the British Isles.        </content>
