		<content> Children in Whipsnade between 5 and 9 
 years travel by coach to Studham      
 School and children in Kensworth      
 attend their village school.Kensworth 
 school has 74 on roll,3 teachers,and 2
 other staff.The hours are from        
 9am-3.15pm.At the age of 9 years the  
 children move on to Middle Schools in 
 Dunstable and at 13 years transfer to 
 Upper Schools.Again coaches are       
 provided by the local authority for   
 transport.Children may leave school at
 16 years or go to Sixth Form College  
 for further education and then on to  
 University or Polytechnic if they are 
 of academic standard.As well as the   
 state education system,to which       
 everyone is entitled,some people      
 prefer to pay for their children's    
 education.There are several private   
 schools within easy reach but some    
 board at those farther afield.        </content>
