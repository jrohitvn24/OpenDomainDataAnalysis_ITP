		<title>05TOWN CENTRE SHOPS.</title>
		<content> HOCKLEY IS A SMALL TOWN WITH LIMITED  
 SHOPPING FACILITIES, SIMILAR TO A     
 DISTRICT CENTRE WITHIN A MAJOR TOWN.  
 THE TYPE OF SHOPPING FACILITIES ARE   
 LIMITED TO MEDIUM ORDER SHOPS AND     
 OFFICE FACILITIES. THIS IS DUE TO THE 
 TOWNS PROXIMITY TO SOUTHEND AND       
 BASILDON WHICH PROVIDE THE REGIONS    
 MAIN SHOPPING CENTRES. THE TYPE OF    
 SHOPS FOUND WITHIN THE CENTRE HAVE AN 
 OBVIOUS INFLUENCE UPON THE MARKET     
 AREA. PEOPLE WHO USE THE CENTRE COME  
 FROM THE TOWN AND SMALL VILLAGES TO   
 THE NORTH. THIS IS ONLY FOR GENERAL   
 SHOPPING AND NOT FOR CLOTHING AND     
 FURNITURE AS THESE FACILITIES ARE     
 LIMITED. WHEN PEOPLE SHOP FOR HIGH    
 ORDER GOODS THEY REQUIRE A SHOPPING   
 CENTRE WITH A WIDE SELECTION AND      
 THEREFORE TRAVEL TO LARGER TOWNS AND  
 SHOPPING CENTRES.                     
                                       </content>
