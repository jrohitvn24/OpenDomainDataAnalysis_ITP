		<title>12Haslington - Housing.</title>
		<content> The majority of houses of the area are
 of the Victorian period although new  
 building is being carried out.There   
 are many farms and adjoining farm     
 workers cottages.The largest          
 settlement is the village of          
 Haslington .The Hawk Inn and the two  
 black and white cottages opposite are 
 dated 1510 and these are the oldest   
 buildings in the area.                
 Much development has taken place west 
 of the main road and property dates   
 from 1930 to 1980's.                  
 Very little property is rented, the   
 majority being owner occupied.The new 
 development is high density,open plan 
 property,much of which is             
 semi-detached.
