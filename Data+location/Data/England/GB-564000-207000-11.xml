		<title>11ROXWELL KENNELS(CONT)</title>
		<content> As we walked into Tony Dobson's       
 Roxwell dog kennels we witnessed an   
 amazing sight. There were more than 45
 fairly friendly dogs, but there were a
 few bad tempered alsations. Their     
 sleeping areas were 6 foot by 6 foot  
 or 8 foot by 8 foot for the very big  
 dogs. They also keep gerbils, budgies 
 and terrapins. The dogs have their own
 wash and grooming room and hygiene and
 cleanliness are very important. Before
 you enter the kennel area you have to 
 tread in disinfectant and all dogs    
 have to have vaccination certificates 
 before they are allowed on to the     
 premises.                             
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
