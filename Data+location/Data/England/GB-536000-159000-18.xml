		<title>18Life in New Addington</title>
		<content>On Saturday mornings I get up at about 
8.30am and I watch telly all the way   
through till 12.15pm.Somtimes I watch  
or play football but now the football  
seasons over theres not much to do but 
near May 18th-20th the fair comes up on
Milne Park green but only for a        
week.Somtimes I go exploring in the    
woods with friends or I go to stay with
relatives.On Sundays I get up about    
9.00am and theres nothing on telly I   
just sit indoors and do some reading or
drawing and writing.Apart from that    
theres nothing else to do.I think they 
should put an adventure playground near
us.The nearest one is Crystal Palace.It
is too far away to go on a bus.All the 
parks near us are ruined by vandals.The
only decent one is too far to walk but 
if you are bored you might as well take
a walk.Croydon has the nearest cinema.I
think they should open one in Addington</content>
