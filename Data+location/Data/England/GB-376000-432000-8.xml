		<title>08MR. BLUNDELL 1</title>
		<content> Mr Blundell was born in 1904.  There  
 were four children in his family and  
 he lived in five different houses in  
 Read.  There was a farm and a football
 pitch where now there are houses.     
                                       
 He went to school in Read when the    
 school consisted of only the hall and 
 one classroom.  Badly behaved children
 got the cane.  If you pulled your     
 cuffs over your hand you got a harder 
 strike.  He went to Sunday School and 
 church three times on Sundays.        
                                       
 Mr Blundell started half-time work at 
 the age of twelve.  While his friends 
 worked in the cotton mill he worked   
 with his father in the shoe shjop     
 where they made clogs with wooden     
 soles.
