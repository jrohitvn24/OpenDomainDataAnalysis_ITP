		<title>13HOUSING:WOODTON AREA</title>
		<content> There are 94 dwellings in this block, 
 of which 62 lie within Woodton's      
 village guideline.Building outside the
 planning guideline is allowed only in 
 exceptional circumstances.The guide-  
 lines are being updated by Norfolk C.C
 but may not be greatly extended.The   
 majority of these dwellings are owner-
 occupied:of the 63 houses,15 are      
 rented,12 being council houses,&amp; of   
 the 31 bungalows 15 are rented,14     
 being 'homes for the elderly'.Three   
 council properties have been sold to  
 their occupants since 1980. The older 
 dwellings are houses or cottages,some 
 of the latter have been modernised    
 into single-,from double-dwellers.    
 Many of the post-1918 dwellings are   
 bungalows-Norfolk's favourite-or      
 chalet-bungalows.About half have been 
 built since 1945,in effect 'infilling'
 to create nucleated villages.         </content>
