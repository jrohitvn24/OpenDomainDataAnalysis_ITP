		<content> The only church in the area is St     
 John's Church of England. It is the   
 Parish Church for part of Roundhay and
 the Ladywood area.  Built in 1826 from
 local stone it is stituated close to  
 the A58 Wetherby Road.  The spire has 
 a clock with a blue face and Roman    
 numerals.  The two main doors are oak,
 and there are several stained glass   
 windows within the walls. The old     
 churchyard is in front of the church, 
 and the new churchyard on the hillside
 behind.  It is surrounded by trees,   
 with wild flowers, birds, foxes,      
 rabbits and squirrels inhabiting the  
 grounds.  Three services are held     
 every Sunday - Holy Communion, Matins 
 and Evensong.  The vicarage is in     
 Oakwood Grove, and the parochial hall 
 in Fitzroy Drive, Oakwood.
