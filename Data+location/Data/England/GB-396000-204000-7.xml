		<title>07Craftsman in Stone</title>
		<content>   There is a self-employed craftsman  
 who lives in Middle Duntisbourne and  
 has a small workshop where he makes   
 and sells garden ornaments, tables,   
 benches and staddle stones.           
                                       
   These are made from a mixture of    
 cement and powdered limestone from    
 Daglingworth Quarry which is poured   
 into moulds and left to set.  It is   
 then turned out and given an antique  
 finish by scouring and pitting the    
 surface with a small trowel-shaped    
 tool.                                 
                                       
   After a few days the article dries  
 rock hard and is ready for sale. When 
 it has been weathered for a few years 
 it is difficult to tell the new from  
 the genuine old stone ones.           
                                       
                                       </content>
