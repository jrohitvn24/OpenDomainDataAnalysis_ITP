		<title>06A BROWNHILLS DOCTOR'S DAY.</title>
		<content>   My father is a doctor in Brownhills.
 He usually gets up at 6.30am and then 
 makes his own breakfast before        
 journeying to his surgery which       
 commences at 9am.                     
   He is very busy during the mornings,
 rarely coming home for lunch. His most
 demanding day is Monday when he       
 averages 35 patients during the       
 morning and 20 patients in the        
 evening.                              
   He does not come home usually until 
 10pm, when I am asleep. He then       
 changes into casual clothing and has a
 snack and a hot drink. His last task  
 is to finish his paperwork in his     
 study upstairs. This takes him until  
 about 11.40pm which means that he has 
 little chance of watching television. 
 He then goes to bed at the end of a   
 hard day's work.
