		<content>  THE THANET WAY, WHICH IS NEAR HERNE  
 BAY IS 5O YEARS OLD. THIS ROAD IS VERY
 DANGEROUS BECAUSE IT USED TO HAVE 3   
 LANES BUT NOW THERE ARE ONLY 2 IN THE 
 SAME SPACE. HOLIDAY MAKERS DO NOT KNOW
 THIS ROAD AND TRY TO OVERTAKE WHERE IT
 IS NOT SAFE.                          
  THE POLICE GAVE US SOME INFORMATION  
 ABOUT ACCIDENTS. BETWEEN GREENHILL &amp;  
 MILL LANE JUNCTION, FROM MAY 1982 -   
 MAY 1985, 34 CYCLISTS WERE INJURED, A 
 LARGE NUMBER OF THESE WERE FRENCH     
 STUDENTS VISITING THE TOWN.           
 PEDESTRIANS CROSS THIS ROAD TO GET TO 
 HERNE BAY AND 11 OF THEM WERE INJURED.
 26 PEOPLE WHO USE MOTOR CYCLES HAD    
 ACCIDENTS, 17 RIDERS AND 9 PILLION    
 PASSENGERS WERE KILLED OR INJURED.    
  THE FINAL GROUP OF PEOPLE TO HAVE HAD
 ACCIDENTS ARE MOTORISTS. 11 DRIVES AND
 14 PASSENGERS BEING KILLED OR INJURED.
