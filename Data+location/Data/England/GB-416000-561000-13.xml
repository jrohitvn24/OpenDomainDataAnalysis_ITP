		<title>13BLAYDON'S AMBULANCE SERVICE.</title>
		<content> The ambulance service in Blaydon has  
 seven ambulances. They are            
 recognisable by their colours of white
 with red stripes along their sides.   
 The two drivers we spoke to said that 
 they have more doctor or house calls  
 to make than emergencies. There are   
 eleven men at Blaydon Station who all 
 work shifts. The "emergency" van is   
 equipped with three sorts of oxygen,  
 antiseptic spray, bandages, bowls,    
 splints, gauze, savlon, neck collars, 
 arm slings, a rescue box, bed-pan and 
 breathing aparatus. There are also two
 stretchers and some maternity wear    
 which they use very rarely. The       
 ambulance has many lights, and a two  
 way radio to keep in contact with the 
 station. The ambulance has a maximum  
 speed of eighty mile an hour and has a
 siren to warn traffic as it goes to   
 emergencies.                          </content>
