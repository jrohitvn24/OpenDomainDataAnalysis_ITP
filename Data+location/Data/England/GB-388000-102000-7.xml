		<title>07LIVING AT BIRCH CLOSE</title>
		<content> My daddy is a dairy man and we live at
 Lower Cottage, Birch, which is a farm 
 and group of cottages surrounded by   
 fields.  The house we live in used to 
 be two cottages, but years ago it was 
 made into one.  About six years ago   
 the original farmhouse was burnt down.
 This house had not been lived in for  
 many years.  In December 1984, from   
 our diningroom window, we could see a 
 drilling rig across the fields.  This 
 drilling rig was working night and day
 for several months, but no oil was    
 found.
