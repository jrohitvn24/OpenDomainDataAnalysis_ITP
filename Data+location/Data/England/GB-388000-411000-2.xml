		<title>02The development of Rochdale.</title>
		<content> textile industry. With the Industrial 
 Revolution however, the textile       
 industry changed from domestic to     
 factory manufacture. Soon cotton took 
 over from wool and was the main fibre 
 spun in the Rochdale area. Raw cotton 
 was imported through the port of      
 Liverpool. Rochdale became important  
 mainly for the spinning branch of the 
 industry.                             
   In common with other Lancashire     
 towns, Rochdale has suffered badly    
 from foreign competition. Many mills  
 have closed ; although, the buildings 
 are now used in some cases for other  
 industrial purposes. There has been   
 recent expansion of light industry in 
 an attempt to compensate for the      
 declining textile trade.
