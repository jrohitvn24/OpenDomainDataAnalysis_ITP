		<content>{An impression of a disco              
 As I went through the door the lights 
 buzzed as the electric was turned on. 
 The lights started flashing,the whole 
 place was lit up.A heavy metal pop    
 group stepped onto the stage          
 immediatley the sound of electric     
 guitars,drums and cymbols increased by
 two enourmous loudspeakers.Four       
 breakdancers danced and jumped at the 
 back of the stage.On the floor every  
 one was dancing there heart out.      
{Country disco}The disco lasted from   
 8.30_11.00.As I went in the door I saw
 coloured flashing lights.A record     
 played loud music_very exciting.A disc
 jockey played records favourites ones 
 could be requested.At 9.45 there was a
 break for refreshments.There were     
 competitions for the best disco dancer
 body popper and the best              
 rock'n'roller.                        </content>
