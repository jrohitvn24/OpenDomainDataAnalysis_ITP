		<title>06EARDINGTON MILL</title>
		<content>{   Eardington mill}was used in 1910.  
 Nowadays only the building remains,but
 on the wall you can still see the     
 markings of the water wheel           
 mountings.                            
    Next to the water wheel there was a
 small Bakery where local people got   
 their bread from. Inside the mill is  
 an{apple grinding stone.              
 Next to the mill were 2 cottages,and  
 by it is a small stream.Over the      
 stream is a wooden bridge.In the mill 
 they made paper as well. Nearby is a  
{track}with some logs so they could    
 take their carts down. In the wood    
 there is a boggy place where it is    
 said a{cow once sunk}under the ground 
 completely.                           
                                       
      It is said that the old mill     
 wheel has been taken to the U.S.A.
