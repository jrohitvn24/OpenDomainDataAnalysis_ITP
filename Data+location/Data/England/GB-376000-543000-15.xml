		<title>15SURROUNDINGS IN NENTHEAD</title>
		<content> Standing by the River Nent in the     
 village I can see spoil heaps on      
 either side with very little          
 vegetation. New varieties of grasses  
 and trees have been planted on them   
 this year. Behind Wright's Garage is a
 huge spoil heap with some large trees 
 growing on it.                        
  Narrow steep-sided head water valleys
 which abound in this area aare known  
 as gills or Cloughs suggesting Norse  
 or Scandinavian settlement at an      
 earlier time.                         
  The Hush has the biggest group of    
 Trees in Nenthead. The Hush was used  
 by miners looking for lead ore. Miners
 built  a dam on the fell, when it was 
 full it would be blown up. The sudden 
 rush of water would make a gorge in   
 which miners could find minerals.
