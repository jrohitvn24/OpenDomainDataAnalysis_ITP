		<content> The Dugdale family still own Blythe   
 Mill after hundreds of years.Mr Roy   
 Clark leases it from them.The mill    
 that is there now was built about 2 to
 3 hundred years ago,but a mill stood  
 on the site as long ago as 1100 AD.The
 old wheel is not in use now because it
 is broken so the mill itself is just  
 used for storage.Mr Clark sells animal
 feeds,fertilizers,and seeds.Inside the
 mill there are still a few bits of    
 machinery but these are not in use.As 
 the mill is by the River Blythe,it    
 gets quite a bit of flooding.The      
 floods usually happen in the Summer   
 because the ground is hard and dry and
 the water easily runs over it.The     
 floods are caused by the River Blythe 
 and the River Cole which all join     
 nearby.Mr Clark has to lift up his    
 furniture when the floods come so it  
 doesn't get wet.                      </content>
