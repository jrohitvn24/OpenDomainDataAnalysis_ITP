		<title>14POLICE DOG TRAINING</title>
		<content> The Greater Manchester Constabulary   
 and Lancashire Constabulary use the   
 area regularly for training their dogs
 in tracking.  It is an ideal place    
 because it is not frequented by many  
 people, therefore a dog being         
 introduced to tracking does not become
 confused with different scents.  The  
 dogs set out from a base and are then 
 encouraged to find pre-planted        
 objects, the scent of which they have 
 been given at base.  As the dog       
 learns, so the scents get harder to   
 find.  Competitions within the        
 different regional forces are popular 
 and so the area is used as a practice 
 ground prior to these events.
