		<title>12HAIRDRESSING</title>
		<content>{byPAUL AND SEAN O'SHEA (aged 10and11) 
 We have our hair cut at the barbers.  
 Above the shop there is a sign saying 
 Graham Paul.When we go in the man     
 tells us to sit down.We ask the man   
 if we can have a trim.The man sprays  
 our hair and combs it up.Before the   
 hair leaves the comb he cuts it.To cut
 round the ear he uses an electric     
 shaver.A hair cut costs Â£2.40.        
{JAMAICAN HAIR STYLES DONE AT HOME.    
 On Friday every two months Kerine and 
 I get our hair done.The hairdresser   
 starts at five 0'Clock and finishes   
 at eleven 0'clock.It takes three hours
 for my hair and three hours to do     
 Kerine's.Joyce combs our hair then she
 plaits it after she plaits false hair 
 on to our real hair then burns the    
 false hair at the bottom.Afterwards   
 she puts on beads then she knots it at
 the end.{by Kay Morgan aged 10.}      </content>
