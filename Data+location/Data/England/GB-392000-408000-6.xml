 We interviewed my mum and             
 grandmother.The first question was    
 "Why did you move house?"My mum said  
 it was  because she got married and my
 grandmother said she moved because her
 father went into business in          
 Rochdale.The second question was "How 
 many places have you lived in?"My mum 
 said she only moved once and Gran said
 she moved 6 times.We asked if they    
 liked it where they used to live and  
 they both said yes.The last question  
 was "Whereabouts were you born?" My   
 mum was born in Rochdale and Gran was 
 born at Greengate in Yeadon.
