		<content>  St Nicholas' Church is situated near 
 the centre of the village.It may have 
 been founded by St Aldhem on the site 
 of a pagan temple.The Norman building 
 is low and solid in aspect,its central
 tower squat and apparently unfinished.
 The chancel is dimly lit though more  
 light was introduced by the widening  
 of the window in the 17th century.    
 The roof is supported by decorated    
 Norman crossed-vaulting which rests on
 cushioned capitals. Outside the tower 
 has been buttressed.The stone walls of
 the church are covered in places with 
 attractive red lichen. The church     
 stands in the midst of a well tended  
 grave yard.
