		<content>    It's usually just mum and me at    
 home because my dad is often away with
 the Navy in{Oman,}in the{Middle East. 
{                                      
    When he comes home mum and I go up 
 to{Heathrow Airport}in the{car}to meet
 him. It's a great joy when he gets    
 home. He usually brings us a present. 
                                       
    He is usually tired for a while but
 the next day he often does a job,     
 cleaning the garage for instance. Most
 days we go to the{pub}for{lunch.}The  
 barman likes to chat to dad when he's 
 home.                                 
                                       
   The next day some of our relations  
 come and we often go to{Stourhead     
 because we all like it there.
