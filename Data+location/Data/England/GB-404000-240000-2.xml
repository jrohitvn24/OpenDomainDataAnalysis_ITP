		<content>  Housing within our area is very      
 varied. The oldest residence is the   
 Manor, standing next to the church at 
 Wickhamford. This is a large half -   
 timbered Tudor building with many     
 gables. It stands on the site of a    
 grange of Evesham Abbey, overlooking  
 lawns, a lake and a dovecot.          
  Also in the older part of the village
 are half-timbered, thatched cottages  
 and large farmhouses.                 
  Near the Sandys Arms public house are
 a number of council houses. Along     
 Pitchers Hill is a variety of houses  
 and bungalows. Near the recreation    
 ground is a small estate of more      
 modern housing. At the present time a 
 small estate of new houses is being   
 completed in Wickham Close.           
  The part of Evesham within our area  
 consists almost entirely of newly     
 built houses with small gardens.      </content>
