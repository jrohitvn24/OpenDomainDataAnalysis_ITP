		<title>11Lore and Legend</title>
		<content> Ugglebarnby and Fylingdales Moors have
 played host to many legends.          
 The most famous of these legends is   
 the legend of "The Penny Hedge". The  
 legend states that in the fifth year  
 of the reign of Henry the Second,     
 three noblemen were hunting a wild    
 boar. The hounds chased the wounded   
 boar into the place called The        
 Hermitage where a hermit lived. The   
 hermit looked after the boar but it   
 eventually died. The noblemen were    
 very annoyed with the hermit and set  
 about him. The hermit sent for the    
 Abbot and told him to forgive them.   
 The Abbot set a penance on the men    
 which was to build a hedge in Whitby  
 at low tide on Ascension Day which had
 to withstand three tides. The hedge   
 had to cost no more than one penny.
