		<content> The{church of all Saints}is of{12th   
{Century date.}The interior is unspoilt
 by Victorian 'renovators' who so      
 altered the fabric of many of our     
 medieval churches. Within the church  
 are memorial brasses, and on a pillar 
 in the south aisle{medieval graffiti, 
 consisting of drawings of ships and   
 geometric patterns. All saints is now 
 a{'redundant church'}and is usually   
 kept locked up. Although it is still  
 concecrated. The local people want to 
 see it opened for weddings, funerals, 
 public meetings etc, and have applied 
 to the Archbishop for this. In the    
 churchyard beneath an ancient yew tree
 are buried members of the Culmer      
 family, the headstones bearing dates  
 in the 1750s. This family is also     
 associated with Minster in Thanet, and
 Broadstairs, where they were ship-    
 builders from the reign of Henry VIII.</content>
