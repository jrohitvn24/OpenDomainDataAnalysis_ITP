		<title>20A Day in the Life of Lisa.</title>
		<content> "Lisa time to get up". I am half awake
 at 7.30 am. My sister gets up and has 
 breakfast, I get up and have a wash.  
 It's a Monday morning and all I can   
 think about is bed. I get dressed and 
 go downstairs. At 8.20 my friend      
 comes. We walk to school and talk     
 a lot! When we get school we have a   
 natter about the weekend. At 9.00 a.m.
 we all pile into school ready to work.
 We sometimes start with maths then    
 topic work or perhaps P.E. We assemble
 at 10.10 and then it is playtime      
 for 15 minutes. At 12.00 we have lunch
 and play until 1.20 and do more work. 
 At 3.00 we have a story. At 3.20 we go
 home. We have dinner at 5.00. Then I  
 get ready for Majorettes. I get in my 
 dad's van and off we go. It lasts from
 6.00 till 9.00 and by then sweat is   
 dripping off my head. At 9.30 I go to 
 bed.                                  </content>
