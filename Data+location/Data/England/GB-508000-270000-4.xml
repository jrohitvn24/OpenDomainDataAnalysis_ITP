		<content>   Two roads cross the area from North 
 to South: the B66O, leading from the  
 Al through Catworth to Kimbolton; and 
 a minor road from the A6O4 through    
 Spaldwick and Stow Longa to Kimbolton 
 and the A45.   Apart from the hamlet  
 of Little Catworth, all the housing in
 the area lies close to these roads,   
 and residents are within easy reach of
 the country's motorway network.       
                                       
   Access to the land between the two  
 roads is provided by farm tracks,     
 public footpaths and bridleways.  Most
 of these remain in use, although the  
 sign-posting of paths and bridleways  
 in the area is generally poor.   A few
 minor footpaths have fallen into      
 disuse, either as a result of modern  
 farming methods, or because they no   
 longer fulfil a local need.
