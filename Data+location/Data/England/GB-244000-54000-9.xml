		<title>09ROYAL NAVAL DOCKYARD</title>
		<content> The Royal Naval Dockyard employs      
 approximately 13,000 people. These    
 people repair and refit the{ships}in  
 the Dockyard. There is a frigate      
 complex which can hold three frigates 
 during refit. After they have been    
 refitted they will undergo tests in a 
 special basin. There is a weekend     
 annually in August called "Navy Days" 
 when members of the public can look   
 over the Dockyard, ships and          
 submarines. Some places, including the
 latest nuclear{submarines,}are        
 sometimes out of bounds for security  
 reasons. The Dockyard played a major  
 part in the Falklands conflict,       
 converting liners into troop carriers.
 Many men work shifts. There is concern
 at the moment over Government plans to
 privatise the Yard. Some people say   
 that 2000 jobs will be lost.
