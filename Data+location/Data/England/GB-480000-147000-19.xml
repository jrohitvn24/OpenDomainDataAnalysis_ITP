		<content>  The country side around Hale is      
 beautiful especicially 'Off the Beaten
 Track.'                               
  There is Farnham Park which links    
 Hale and Farnham.Its facilities       
 include,golf,ruby,cricket and         
 football.                             
  Near the town there is the old Castle
 dating back to 1138 and with many     
 addition as in use today as an        
 international breefing centre.        
  To the west lanes lead to quiet      
 valleys hiding manor houses and farms.
 It is hard to belive the town is so   
 close.                                
  Also hidden here is a thriving riding
 stable and near the army ground is a  
 purpose built B.M.X. track.           
  THe North of the village is bordered 
 by army ground left in its natural    
 state.
