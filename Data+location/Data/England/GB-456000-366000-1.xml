		<title>01Warsop: A  General View.</title>
		<content>     Our block can be divided into 3   
 main sections according to land use.  
   Settlement is mainly in the west of 
 the area, largely in the triangle     
 formed by the junction of the 2       
 mineral railways and the River Meden. 
   Warsop is an old settlement sited   
 originally around the church but      
 developed onto the south eastern      
 slopes of the river to avoid flooding.
 Although originally a farming village,
 it is now a combination of farming,   
 mining and residential areas.  It has 
 a population of over 15,000. The main 
 routes of communication are the A6O   
 road running north-south and the      
 B6035 running east-west.              
   The eastern part of the block is    
 mainly agricultural land under crops  
 and coniferous woodland which is part 
 of Sherwood Forest. The forest makes  
 our block more picturesque.           </content>
