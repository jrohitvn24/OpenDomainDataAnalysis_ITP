		<title>20An Australian Viewpoint</title>
		<content>   We are the Nulty family from Alice  
 Springs, Australia, on a teacher-     
 exchange visit to Ridgeway for 1 year.
  Our main impression is of the        
 compactness of your country. The      
 houses are smaller with upstairs      
 floors and often attached to each     
 other. The streets are narrower, cars 
 smaller and shops in many cases       
 smaller too. It is surprising to find 
 villages and farms so near to a city. 
   The English appreciate gardens and  
 parks more than we do.                
   The climate is obviously a big      
 difference, but we love your long     
 summer evenings.                      
   We miss our utility room and        
 pumpkins, and HATE mushy peas.
