 for 70 years! He is now at{Rockford

{Ringwood National School.}In 1914, at 
 13, he left school and worked on a    
 farm with shire horses and later in   
 life he owned his own{Percheron.}He   
 could plough an acre a day with a good
 horse but he had to{"move with the    
{times"}and brought tractors and he    
 could then plough 15 acres a day.     
   In{Ringwood Market}he sold eggs,    
 potatoes and cattle. He has also kept 
 sheep and done his own shearing. His  
 wife, a local lady, helped with milk- 
 ing. Nowadays he doesn't get up until 
 6 o'clock and has only a few animals.
