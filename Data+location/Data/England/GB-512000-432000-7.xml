		<title>07 Saltshouse School Ecology</title>
		<content>   We decided to do the{ecology}side of
 the DOMESDAY project. In our school   
 grounds we have 234{trees.}Among these
 there are; Almond, Ash, Cyprus, Elm,  
 Mulberry, Silver Birch, Sycamore,     
 Weeping Willow and Willow. There were 
 also many Hawthorn{trees,}in fact     
 there were 163. Elder came second with
 29 and Sycamore third with 10.        
   We decided there were more Hawthorn 
 because they spread more easily. A    
 bird eats a berry, flies off and      
 leaves the{seed}in its droppings. The 
 seed grows and the cycle is repeated. 
   Around the front of the school are  
 more decorative species put there for 
 show. Examples of these are; Almond,  
 Ash, Elm and Silver Birch.            
   We took the Ph value of the{soil}   
 around our DOMESDAY area, we found the
 majority of it was close to neutral.
