		<title>19KITTY THE GHOST</title>
		<content> Kitty, or Katy, is supposed to be a   
 ghost who haunts the site of the      
 Bridon Fibres Rope Works in Willington
 Quay that have recently been          
 demolished.                           
 The story is that Kitty is a worker   
 who used to work there many years ago.
 One day, while working in the factory,
 which was then called R. Hood Haggie, 
 or 'Haggies' as we call it, her hair  
 got caught in a machine which pulled  
 it until her head was cut off by a    
 cutting machine.                      
 She is said to haunt the mill every   
 night carrying her head.              
  There is another story that she      
 got pushed out of a train which runs  
 above the ropeworks on a viaduct and  
 the train ran over her, killing her.  
 Some people say that at midnight      
 every so often the train runs again!
