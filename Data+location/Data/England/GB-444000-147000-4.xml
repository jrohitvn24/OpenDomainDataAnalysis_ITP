		<content>   Bere Mill is another of the old     
 mills of Whitchurch.This mill was once
 owned by Henri de Portal who was      
 French Hugenot who fled from France at
 the end of the seventeenth century.He 
 bought the mill in 1712.While he was  
 at Bere Mill he discovered how to     
 watermark banknotes.                  
   He stayed at Bere Mill until 1724   
 when the mill became too small for his
 expanding business.He moved the fim to
 Overton but the mill is still owned by
 Portals.
