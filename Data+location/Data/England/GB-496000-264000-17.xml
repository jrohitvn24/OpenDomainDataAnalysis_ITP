		<title>17 Rushden Fire Station</title>
		<content>  Rushden fire station is along Newton 
Road. The station consists of 12 men,  
and 3 fire engines.                    
  The men work shifts of 4 days on, 4  
days off. Their weekly routine consists
of cleaning the station and vehicles,  
fire drills and general maintenance on 
all vehicles and equipment.            
  When an emergency call is made it is 
passed through Moulton where a V.D.U.  
is used to find the fire's location and
inform the station.                    
  The protective clothing they use is  
of a waterproof, flameproof, material. 
Their steel lined boots protect them   
from falling debris. They also wear a  
yellow helmet made of plastic and cork.
  In late 1985 a new fire station will 
be opened in Washbrook Rd, the old one 
will be closed as it is too small to   
house the equipment needed to fight    
modern day fires.                      </content>
