		<content>   In our area there are few           
 residential buildings,only three      
 houses and one hotel.We found farms   
 called Lock's Farm,Manor Farm and     
 Great Copse Farm.                     
   The{farmland}was used as both       
 cultivated fields and pasture land.   
 There was some mixed woodland.        
   A{Drainage Network}covered          
 part of the area .The ditches were    
 used to drain{Reclaimed Land}further  
 north.                                
    Most of the reclaimed land was mud 
 taken from the River Test.            
   There was only one Post Office in   
 the area.We saw a{golf course}with a  
 pub next to it;one of the two pubs in 
 the survey area.
