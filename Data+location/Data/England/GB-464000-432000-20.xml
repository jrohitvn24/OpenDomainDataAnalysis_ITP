		<title>20Education in Cliffe</title>
		<content>      Cliffe School was founded in 1708
 when Mary Waud left money to provide  
 education for poor children. The      
 school built then stayed on the same  
 site in York Road until 1982, when a  
 new one was built in Main Street, just
 outside the area of this survey.      
      Children from 4 to 11 come to    
 Cliffe School, then they go to Barlby 
 High School. This year there are 63   
 pupils in three classes in the school.
      This survey was made by children 
 in the top class: Lindsay Bowskill,   
 Yvonne Calvert, Richard Chatham,      
 Joseph Chatterton,Catherine Hayselden,
 Jane Hinchliffe, Gillian Kirby, Brian 
 Miles, Ellen Murphy, Lisa Rickard,    
 James Robinson, Ruth Simpson,         
 Alison Skinner, Deborah and Michael   
 Smith, Matthew Smith, Richard Smith,  
 Colin Stephens, Claire Thompson, David
 Tomlinson and Peter Tune.             </content>
