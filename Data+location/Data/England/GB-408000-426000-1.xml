		<title>01GENERAL DESCRIPTION</title>
		<content>  The area lies to the north of Halifax
 town centre. It comprises mainly of an
 upland area rising to a height of     
 297m. This area is covered mainly with
 uncultivated non_woodland vegetation_ 
 grassland. There are the remains of   
 many old quarries which were used for 
 local building materials, but are now 
 generally worked out.                 
  The vallies of Shibden and Ovenden   
 once used fast flowing streams to work
 textile mills which used the wool from
 locally bred sheep. Today this        
 industry has largely died out leaving 
 only one major producer of high       
 quality worsted yarns.
