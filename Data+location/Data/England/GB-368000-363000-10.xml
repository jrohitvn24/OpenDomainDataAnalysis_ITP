		<content> There are badgers, squirrels and foxes
 near the school.Some get run over.    
 There are squirrels' dreys and magpie 
 nests in the wood over the road. We   
 see them popping back and to.There are
 hedgehogs and badgers which just go   
 across the road without looking.There 
 is a moorhen and babies in the pond in
 the wood.We have a pond in the school 
 field with frogs, newts and insects.  
       {THE WOOD}                      
     Squirrels look for nuts.          
     People dump their rubbish.        
     Moorhens!                         
     A big pit with water in it.       
     Dried up in summer.               
     Lots of wild flowers.             
     Mainly oak trees.                 
{STONEY PATH.}Wild flowers grow here   
 protected by a high hedge from the    
 weedkiller sprays.In some places it is
 muddy.I got my welly stuck in a hole. </content>
