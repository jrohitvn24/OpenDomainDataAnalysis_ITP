		<content>{Faceby}derives from Feitr, a personal 
 name, and the Danish "by" and has been
 translated as "Fatty's Farm".{Swainby}
 is also thought to derive from a      
 personal name, Sveyn.{Whorlton,}the   
 "Wirueltune" of Domesday Book, comes  
 from the old Norse "hverfill" a       
 rounded hilltop and the Saxon "ton",  
 the settlement under a round hill.    
 This area is associated with{Roman    
{occupation.}A hoard of silver         
 ornaments and coins was ploughed up on
 Whorl Hill in 1810, dated well after  
 AD 402, and when Whorlton churchyard  
 was extended in 1907 and again in 1977
 fragments of Roman pottery dating     
 AD 300-407 were found each time,      
 suggesting a Roman settlement nearby. 
 Pieces of mediaeval pottery were also 
 found. Proof of pre-Conquest          
 occupation lies in the{Iron Age}fort  
 and field system on Live Moor.        </content>
