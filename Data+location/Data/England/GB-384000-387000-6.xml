		<content>    AT PLAYTIME WE PLAY GAMES LIKE     
{BULLDOG} AND{KICKSTONE.}IN{ BULLDOG   
 ONE PERSON IS ON AND HAS TO TICK OR   
 TOUCH THE OTHER PEOPLE WHO ARE        
 PLAYING. THEY HAVE TO TRY AND GET     
 ACROSS TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE       
 PLAYGROUND WITHOUT THE PERSON WHO IS  
 ON TICKING THEM. WHEN SOMEONE IS      
 TICKED THEY ARE ON TOO. THE PERSON WHO
 IS ON CAN CHOOSE ONE PERSON OR THEY   
 CAN ALL RUN. WE CARRY ON PLAYING UNTIL
 EVERYBODY IS OUT.{KICKSTONE }IS LIKE  
 HIDE AND SEEK. ONE PERSON IS ON. THE  
 OTHER PLAYERS TRY TO GET BACK TO THE  
 KICKSTONE WITHOUT BEING SEEN TO       
 RELEASE THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN CAUGHT BY 
 SHOUTING "FREE ALL". LIKE {BULLDOG }  
 THE FIRST PERSON TO BE CAUGHT STARTS  
 THE NEXT GAME.
