		<title>13MELDON RESERVOIR 2</title>
		<content> The reservoir holds 3.75million cubic 
 metres of water, being 1320m long and 
 up to 44.4m deep. The water flows off 
 the high moor into the reservoir. When
 full the overflow water flows through 
 the spillways down the 44m dam in a   
 foaming cascade. At other times the   
 river flow is maintained by water     
 passing through the outlet channel at 
 the base of the dam. At times of      
 low river flow water is pumped from   
 the reservoir to the treatment plant  
 at Prewley about 1.5km away, before   
 going into the South West Water's     
 mains. The reservoir has a reliable   
 yield of 227000 cubic metres of water 
 per day. This is very important in an 
 area which often suffers from hot dry 
 summers and therefore water shortages.
 Dartmoor lost a beautiful valley when 
 the dam was built, but gained a lake  
 for fishing and windsurfing.          </content>
