		<title>13LAW &amp; ORDER_PRESTON AREA</title>
		<content> The area is about one tenth of the    
 total patrolled by 3 policemen,  based
 in Hitchin,working in shifts_with only
 1 on duty at any one time. A car is   
 essential to cover the large 'beat'   
 and all three have a detailed know_   
 ledge of the local people and their   
 property. Each man makes good use of  
 contacts such as the village shop_    
 keeper to keep in touch with the news.
 There may be an occasional burglary or
 some poaching but there is very little
 crime to deal with. To do their job   
 well,the policemen need to be able to 
 work well alone, be able to take the  
 initiative and to relate easily to the
 local residents.A recent innovation is
 the 'Police Surgery' each Saturday. A 
 police van calls at the village for   
 3/4hr to answer queries and give help_
 to those unable to travel to Hitchin.
