		<title>12West Park Hospital 2</title>
		<content> West Park consists of wards laid out  
 in villas so as to catch the sun.     
 Towards the centre of the hospital are
 the departments such as the laundry,  
 transport and the main hall and social
 centre. There is also a{church}-sadly 
 out of use- but a new chapel is being 
 created.                              
 West Park works in conjunction with   
 the Dept. of Psychological Medicine/  
 Psychiatry at Epsom District Hospital.
                                       
 A number of us are well or nearly well
 enough to leave and go to our homes or
 'new' homes, hostels or 'group' homes.
 There are some lovely walks in the    
 grounds with lawns, gardens and sports
 field and we proudly support one of   
 the most varied collections of trees  
 in the area for which we must thank   
 past employees interest in            
 horticulture.                         </content>
