		<content> The development of Rutland Water as a 
 recreational centre for trout fishing,
 water sports and nature walks has     
 greatly increased the tourist traffic 
 through the Welland Valley, a natural 
 scenic route. There are four          
 registered Bed and Breakfast houses in
 the area and Medbourne Village Hall   
 Committee provide home-made teas every
 Sunday throughout the summer.  The    
 revenue from the teas is used for the 
 upkeep of the hall.                   
 During the autumn and winter the      
 Fernie Hunt attracts a large number of
 car followers. On Easter Monday       
 each year, the village numbers are    
 swelled by visitors who participate in
 or watch the Bottle Kicking ceremony  
 which is preceeded in Medbourne by    
 a band parade.
