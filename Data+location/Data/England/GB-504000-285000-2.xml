		<content>In Polebrook School we have got three  
classrooms. Our teachers are Mrs.      
Berry, Mr. Norwood and Mrs. Rowe.      
Mrs. Berry teaches  the youngest class,
Mr. Norwood teaches the middle class,  
and Mrs. Rowe teaches the oldest       
children. There are seventy-two        
children in the school. Mrs Lack cooks 
the dinner. Mrs. Hart and Mrs. Blake   
are the dinner ladies. Mrs. Chester is 
the caretaker. The school has an old   
building and joined to it is a new     
building. The oldest part was built    
over 100 years ago, while the two      
infant classrooms, the hall and the    
kitchen were added seventeen years ago.
We have got a playground. It has got   
yellow lines on it. We have got a      
playing field and I play tig on the    
field with my friends.
