 CHURCHES AT ST.GERMANS,HESSENFORD AND 
 DOWNDERRY, AND TWO METHODIST CHURCHES,
  AT POLBATHIC AND DOWNDERRY.UNTIL LAST
 YEAR THE METHODIST CHAPEL AT MINARD

    IN THE PAST YEAR WE HAVE LOST BOTH 
 OUR ANGLICAN AND OUR METHODIST        
 MINISTERS.THE FORMER WAS THE VICAR OF 
 ST.GERMANS,WHO ALSO HAD RESPONSIBILITY
 FOR HESSENFORD,  DOWNDERRY &amp; TIDEFORD 
 CHURCHES.FOLLOWING HIS PROMOTION WE   
 NOW HAVE AN UNEASY INTERREGNUM. THE   
 LATTER WAS A GIFTED AND INSPIRING LADY
 MINISTER, OPERATING FROM SALTASH.SHE  
 HAS MOVED ON AND HER REPLACEMENT IS A 
 LAY CLERIC OPERATING IN THIS AREA.
