		<content> In my spare time I usually play       
 outside at the park or I play         
 pressgangs with Kay, Gary, Louise,    
 Lee, Tony, Dale, Justin and           
 Claire.When my grandad has some spare 
 time he plays golf with his friend    
 Kieth.He plays golf on a Monday,      
 Sunday and Wednesday.The idea of golf 
 is to pot a golfball into a hole on   
 the course in the lowest number of    
 hits possible.If  you do this in one  
 they say it is a hole in one and you  
 get the most points.My grandma doesn't
 have much spare time because of her   
 job but when she has some she likes to
 knit or sew a picture,she also likes  
 to make dresses and skirts.When I am  
 at my dads house we go motor bike     
 racing he is number fifty six.He's got
 lots of trophies and one cup.To ride  
 the bike you need a skilled passenger 
 and be good at controling the bike.   </content>
