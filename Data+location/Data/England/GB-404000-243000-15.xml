		<title>15BENGEWORTH CHURCH  (cont)</title>
		<content> The youth club has about thirty       
 members.  There is a group for every  
 age: Mum's and Toddlers, Ladies' Group
 and the Friendly Circle for the       
 elderly.  There are special services  
 and about 24 weddings in a year. There
 is about one funeral a week.  Mr.     
 Banks has five sets of vestments which
 he wears at each season of the year,  
 but he usually wears a black cassock  
 and a white surplice.  On Fridays he  
 goes to the church school or the      
 school walks to church.  At least 75% 
 of those living in Bengeworth said    
 they didn't go to church because they 
 were too busy, but they would go to a 
 special service.  Children, Mums and  
 Dads go to the Family Service and     
 those who sing in the choir go to     
 choir practice on Fridays.
