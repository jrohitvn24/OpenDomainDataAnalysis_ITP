		<title>02The M3 motorway</title>
		<content> The bypass today is dangerous. It goes
 through Compton and Shawford and spli-
 ts the village in half. The new motor-
 way will have many more lanes and less
 bends, that means it will be quieter  
 and safer. One of the big differences 
 is that it will be much higher. That  
 means it will be on a mound. The mound
 will go from Hockley to Compton House,
 so that the motorway will go over the 
 railway instead of under. There won't 
 be a junction on the top of Compton   
 Down instead the Otterbourne Road will
 go over the motorway to Compton. It   
 will also be much less busy around    
 Compton Street. The motorway will cut 
 off a corner of Shawford Down, so some
 other land is going to be given to the
 parish. The work men are planning to  
 plant trees and natural plants. There 
 are lots of arguments about the       
 motorway.                             </content>
