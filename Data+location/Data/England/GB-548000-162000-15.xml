		<title>15Visit to Hewitts Farm.</title>
		<content> On Tuesday we went to visit {Hewitts  
Farm}.To get there we had to walk along
the busy {Orpington By-Pass} until we  
reached the farm gates.                
 Hewitts Farm is a{"Pick Your Own"}    
fruit and vegetable produce farm.There 
are many different fields on the farm  
and to reach them you can ride on a    
special bus which will take you all    
around.The summer time is the busiest  
time of year for Hewitts when they     
employ 30 people at the week ends and  
20 during the week.In winter there is  
not much work because it is often much 
too wet or cold.                       
 One of the main crops grown at Hewitts
are {strawberries} which are planted at
different times so that they do not all
ripen at the same time.This year they  
have got so much fruit they have had to
sell some of it at the markets in      
London.                                </content>
