 The only forms of public transport are
 the bus services, provided by the     
 Southdown Bus Company and Brighton    
 Borough Transport Service and various 
 taxi companies.  The coastal road, the
 A259, connects the area to Brighton in
 the west and to Newhaven in the east. 
 The A259 is the busiest road with     
 fairly heavy through traffic of all   
 types.At peak times and in the season 
 this causes some congestion,          
 especially in Rottingdean.  The only  
 access to and from the north is       
 provided by Falmer Road. Frequent bus 
 services link Rottingdean and         
 Woodingdean before turning westwards  
 to Brighton. Bicycles are only for the
 young and fit. Cars are widely used.  </content>
