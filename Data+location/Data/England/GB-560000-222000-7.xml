		<content> We visited St Mary's church which     
 dates from the 13th century.Reverend  
 Matthews helped us with our research, 
 he told us that there nearly was a    
 fire when candles in the church were  
 left burning on the altar,one candle  
 was faulty and snapped off as it      
 burned,luckily it balanced on the     
 candlestick.We saw an old beam which  
 used to be 23 centimetres thick but it
 had been eaten away to 3 cms by the   
 deathwatch beetle.There are 3 services
 each Sunday,the Sunday School meets   
 at eleven o'clock every Sunday,some   
 children from our school sing in the  
 choir.A few boys go to bell ringing   
 each Tuesday.                         
 There is a Catholic, Baptist and a    
 United Reform church,a few children   
 from our school are regular church    
 goers.Most of these go to St.Mary's   
 church.                               </content>
