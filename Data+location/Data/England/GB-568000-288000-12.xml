		<title>12FELTWELL'S CHARITABLE TRUSTS</title>
		<content>   Feltwell is lucky to have three     
 trusts. The most important is the Sir 
 Edmund de Moundeford Trust. The other 
 trusts are Acmere and Rawlings.       
   Sir Edmund de Moundeford left 660   
 acres of poor fenland to the parish   
 for grazing and peat cutting. Now it  
 is rich farmland rented by local      
 farmers.                              
   Edmund de Moundeford Trust gives the
 people over seventy, twelve pounds    
 at Christmas. Almshouse residents live
 rent free, get 75p a week free T.V    
 licence, free electricity and a       
 certain amount of fireing each year.  
   The children get twenty five pounds 
 on leaving Feltwell School for        
 Methwold High School. In the last five
 years the trust has given Feltwell    
 School a swimming pool and has bought 
 a strip of playing field which the    
 council wanted to sell for building.  </content>
