There is a Church of England Primary   
School in the village, Secondary       
education is found in Thrapston.       
A recreation ground is provided. There 
is also a grocery shop and a Post      
Office. It was the feeling of a number 
of the villagers that more amenities   
should be provided for children and    
teenagers.                             
   There are bus services to           
surrounding towns, but these are not   
always convenient and most people use  
their own cars.
