 The school was opened in l937 as a    
 secondary school, with one main       
 building. Now it operates as a 9-13   
 middle school, with three main        
 buildings.                            
                                       
 In l984 there was an attempt to close 
 the school and to 'bus'the children   
 many miles away to another            
 school.Fortunately an incredible      
 number of people were completely      
 against this move and a very          
 successful 'Save Our School'committee 
 was organised.                        
                                       
 Very many people gave much of their   
 valuable time and considerable effort 
 to this end and we were successful in 
 saving the school.for the moment.....
