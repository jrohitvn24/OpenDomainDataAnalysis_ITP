		<content>  North Newington is a very old place.

There are {107 buildings} in North     
Newington. Only eight of them are      
thatched.                              
  Most of the houses are built out of  
{Hornton Stone} which is a brown and   
beige colour. There are two Public     
Houses. Although the village is only   
small, it has its own Primary School   
called Bishop Carpenter School.        
  There is a {blacksmith} in the       
village which is a rare thing these    
days. The village {Chapel} was built in
1876 but it is now disused. Very few   
houses are built of brick.
