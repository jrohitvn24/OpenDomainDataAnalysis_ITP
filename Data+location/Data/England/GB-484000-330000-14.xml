		<title>14THE LIFE OF AN 8 YEAR OLD</title>
		<content> The first thing I do in the morning is
 I wake up and get dressed then I go   
 down to breakfast.After breakfast I go
 upstairs to the bathroom to do my     
 teeth wash my face and brush my hair. 
 After that if there is time I do my   
 piano practise then I get on my shoes 
 and coat and wait for Victoria, a     
 friend, when she comes we all say     
 goodbye and walk to school. When I get
 to school I sometimes go inside and   
 read a book or stay outside and play. 
 When the bell rings all the children  
 go inside and sit down at their table 
 and wait for Mrs Onions. When Mrs     
 Onions comes she tells us to sit down 
 for assembly and then the infants come
 in for assembly too. We sing about two
 hymns and have a story and prayer then
 the infants go back to their classroom
 and the junior class goes to sit down.
