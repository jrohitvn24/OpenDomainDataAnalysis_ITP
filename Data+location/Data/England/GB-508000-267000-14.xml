		<title>14Kimbolton - Farming</title>
		<content> The typical farm in this block is     
 about 300 acres in size;is a family   
 business employing one or two at      
 most;is rented from Boots Pension     
 Fund;is given over to the growing of  
 winter wheat and barley,and oilseed   
 rape. In fact though,four of the      
 eight farms are privately owned.The   
 field sizes are between 20 and 60     
 acres and well-suited to the use of   
 large machinery.The soil is fertile   
 medium clay loam,much of it classified
 Grade 2 by the Ministry of            
 Agriculture.Common Market policies    
 over the last few years have brought  
 farmers a good living.Another crop is 
 trees,mostly hardwoods. After some    
 years of neglect by the estate recent 
 fellings have been replaced by young  
 plantations and the landscape still   
 appears comparatively denuded.
