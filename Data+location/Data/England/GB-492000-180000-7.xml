		<content> As leisure time increases in the 80s, 
 more time is taken to try and keep    
 fit,espically in the face of          
 increasing heart disease.             
   Many people jog in their spare time 
 or attend classes in keep fit or      
 aerobics.In our class 8 people out of 
 25 regularly jogged.Others took part  
 in swimming,tennis,football and BMX   
 bicycle racing.Snooker and golf were  
 also very popular.Some children       
 enjoyed reading,or collecting things  
 such as perfume bottles and several   
 people played musical instruments.    
 Nearly everybody watched TV in their  
 spare time,some people only did this. 
 The most popular programme was Dallas,
 an American soap opera.
