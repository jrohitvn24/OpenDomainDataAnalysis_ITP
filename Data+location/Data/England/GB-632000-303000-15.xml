		<title>15GREEN BELT AREAS</title>
		<content> There are three public houses.One of  
 them,the Folley Inn,has lately been   
 closed down.The Beauchamp Arms is in a
 green belt area which means it can't  
 be built on.The area has been in the  
 green belt system for about twenty    
 years.The New Inn is probably the     
 biggest of the pubs and was built     
 about 150 years ago.In the green belt 
 area the houses are from 150_350 years
 old.They used to be thatched cottages 
 that farm workers used to live in.Each
 house has around 1 acre of land and   
 mostpeople have a vegetable           
 patch.People who live in these houses 
 don't usually live there formore than 
 ten years because people moved on from
 farm to farm.
