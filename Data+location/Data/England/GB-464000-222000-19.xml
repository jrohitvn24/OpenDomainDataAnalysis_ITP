		<title>19THE VILLAGE SHOPS</title>
		<content> The only shops in the block are       
 situated in Marsh Gibbon,although     
 there is a part time Post Office in   
 Edgcott.                              
 The{butchers shop}is family owned and 
 until recently had its own abattoir.  
 It is used by villages all round the  
 area.                                 
 The{two general stores}are very       
 different . One is a modern           
 shop,opened about 20 years ago and    
 incorporates the sub Post Office and  
 also sells newspapers.                
 The other shop is also family owned   
 and the present owner has worked in   
 the shop for nearly 50 years.The shop 
 is fitted with many old black drawers 
 and has a pair of old brass scales on 
 the counter. He has had a modern      
 weighing machine and a refrigerator   
 installed. Both old village families  
 and newcomers use the store.          </content>
