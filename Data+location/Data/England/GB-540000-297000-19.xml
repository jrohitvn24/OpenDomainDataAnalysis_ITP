		<content>{ Twenty two years ago}some waste land 
 in{Norwood Road,near the railway,}was 
 bought by the{Cambridgeshire and Isle 
 of{Ely Naturalists Trust.}This was for
 a{nature reserve, because there were  
 so{few birds in March.                
  The ground was cleared and{hawthorns 
 were planted to encourage the birds.  
 Other trees in the reserve are;       
{willows, one oak, ash, elder.}Last    
 year{300 birds nests were recorded.   
{ Over 100,000 winter starlings}came   
 from Germany to nest there,but they   
 had to be scared away because of their
 damage to the trees.                  
  Other birds visiting the reserve are 
{magpies,jay,swans,heron,woodpecker,   
{owls,longtailed tit and warblers.     
{ A path}has been made through the     
 middle{to let light in.}This has made 
 space for{grasses and shrubs}for      
{butterflies.  }Nicola Styles.         </content>
