		<title>10Farms in general</title>
		<content> Most are dairy farms with a cottage   
 garden adjoining the farmhouse. Sizes 
 vary from 80-150 acres (average 100). 
 There is no large landowner, the Pole 
 family sold out in the 1920s. At Platt
 Farm one of the sons has developed his
 own piggery, but this is an exception 
 A few sheep are kept, but usually as a
 sideline. Poultry is kept on a small  
 scale, especially turkeys, a constant 
 watch is kept for foxes.To feed the   
 cattle many fields are kept in grass  
 (for silage), maize, rape or mangels. 
 As farms have changed hands farmers   
 have tended to buy or rent fields not 
 adjacent to their own land and this   
 often causes chaos in the narrow      
 lanes as produce is taken to the home 
 farm. A recent innovation is bulb     
 growing. A Colyton businessman has    
 rented fields for spring bulb growing,
 adding colour and increasing tourism. </content>
