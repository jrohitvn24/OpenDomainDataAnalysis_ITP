		<content> Every year on Shrove Tuesday we have  
 Egg Shackling. Sometimes we do it in  
 school and sometimes we go to the     
 Village Hall. Each child brings a     
 fresh, uncooked egg marked clearly    
 with his or her name and all the eggs 
 are put in a big sieve that we borrow 
 from the bakery. Quite often the      
 Rector does the shakling. He shakes   
 all the eggs together and we all      
 listen until we hear a cracking noise.
 The cracked egg is taken out and the  
 shaking starts again. You go on taking
 out cracked eggs until there are only 
 three left. These children win a prize
 -the next one to crack gets third     
 prize and the next one second prize   
 and the last one first prize. We      
 always break the winning egg to show  
 that it is a fresh one! All the eggs  
 are used to make pancakes. It is a    
 very, very old tradition here.        </content>
