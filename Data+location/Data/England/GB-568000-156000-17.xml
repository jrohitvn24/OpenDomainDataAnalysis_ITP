		<title>17A bit of West Malling</title>
		<content> During the week 8th - 12th July I went
 to Leybourne and West Malling to take 
 part in a survey. I was in Mrs.       
 Gibson's group. When we went to West  
 Malling we passed a Dentist, a Post   
 Office, a couple of take-away food    
 shops, two food shops, five non-food  
 shops, one bank, one restaurant and   
 one cafe. We also passed a load of    
 pubs, bars, inns, a hotel and a club  
 for Working Men. We saw one chapel,   
 one abbey, one railway station, five  
 houses, a plastics firm, two lots of  
 rough grazing land, one field of      
 crops, an Estate Agent, a Solicitors  
 and a playgroup.
