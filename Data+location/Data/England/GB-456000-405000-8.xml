   This is a very good game but you    
 need quite a lot of people to play it.
 The rules of the game are simple.When 
 you have made up your mind who is     
 going to be on then the rest of the   
 people stand with their backs against 
 the wall.The person who is on stands  
 about four yards in front of the      
 others and calls out the name of one  
 of the people against the wall and    
 they have to try to get passed the    
 person who is on.                     
   When you are about half way across  
 you shout"BULLDOGS' CHARGE" and the   
 rest of the people try to get across  
 the field without being touched.If you
 are touched then you help the         
 person who is on to catch the others. 
  STOP PRESS The game is now banned    
 because of too many injured children! </content>
