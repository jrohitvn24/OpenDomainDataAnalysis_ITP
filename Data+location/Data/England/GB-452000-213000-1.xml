		<title>01General Description</title>
		<content>Except for the South Western corner of 
the area,where the land rises to the   
North and South from the River Ray,the 
land is flat at about 60 metres above  
sea level.The River Ray runs through   
the area from NE to SW and flows into  
the Cherwell over a weir at Islip.The  
area takes in part of Otmoor (see page 
3) the rest being mainly farmland      
mostly under cereals.There are three   
villages in the area.Islip with a      
population of about 600,Noke with a    
population of about 120,and Oddington  
with about 70.(Figures based on        
electoral rolls.)A footpath known as   
the Oxfordshire Way runs through the   
area from North to South through Islip 
where it turns SE to Noke.Although much
of Otmoor has been drained,the area is 
still subject to flooding in heavy     
rain.
