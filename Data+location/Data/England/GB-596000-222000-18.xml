		<title>18Colchester's "Army" School</title>
		<content>   Colchester has a large garrison, and
 a section of the town area is taken by
 the barracks.                         
   There can be several regimental     
 changes in a year, and educating the  
 army children could cause problems.   
   The children who do not go to an    
 army boarding school are educated,    
 while in Colchester, at The Alderman  
 Blaxill School.                       
   The school has slightly less than   
 fifty percent army children, the rest 
 being from civilian families.         
   Children coming over from Germany,  
 where their fathers were part of the  
 "Rhine Army" often find things        
 different in England.                 
   At one time, however, children used 
 to arrive regularly from Hong Kong, or
 Belize; places which are much further 
 and more different still.
