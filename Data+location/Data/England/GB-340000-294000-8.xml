		<content>                                       
   The{National Trust &lt;NT>}is an       
 organisation which{owns and looks     
{after countryside of natural beauty   
{and importance in England}.200 square 
 miles of the Longmynd are owned by the
 NT.It is the area around Church       
 Stretton.                             
   On the 5th of November, 1959, some  
 members of the NT decided to buy the  
 Longmynd, which was one of Britain's  
 most beautiful country spots situated 
 outside Church Stretton.It cost them  
 Â£18,500 to buy.                       
   The public raised most of the money 
 and in seven months the Longmynd was  
 bought.The deeds were received on     
 behalf of the NT by Mr.Cadbury,one of 
 the members of the NT committee.      
   They wanted to buy it so that no-one
 could build houses or dig mines or    
 spoil the area.                       </content>
