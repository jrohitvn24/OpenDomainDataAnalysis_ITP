		<title>17BRANT BROUGHTON DAIRY FARM</title>
		<content> Our farm "The Dairies" is in the area 
 of Brant Broughton known as the clays.
 This kind of land is good for         
 grassland and crops.The farm has an   
 acreage of 142 and consists of        
 grassland of which there are 100 acres
 The rest is for barley growing which  
 is winter barley. We are dairy farmers
 and have 100 cows. These are mainly   
 friesians which can produce 2000      
 gallons of milk each per year. Some of
 the cows are in calf to charolais and 
 limousin bulls. We were the second    
 people to breed Belgian blue cattle in
 this country. They are becoming a     
 popular breed.                        
    During the summer the cows feed on 
 one half of the grassland and the     
 other half is used for silage which   
 provides winter feed for the cows     
 together with the barley.We have only 
 a little farm machinery.              </content>
