		<title>07HINTON PRIORY</title>
		<content>    Hinton Priory was founded by the   
 Countess of Salisbury(1232)as a Priory
 for Carthusian monks.The Prior was    
 in charge of 16 monks;they lived in   
 small cottages,with their own         
 garden,around a cloister square.      
    The other buildings are a          
 chapel,chapter house,a library above  
 ,a refectory and a gatehouse.         
    At the Reformation(1539)the Priory 
 was closed and all properties and     
 buildings were sold.                  
    The Gatehouse was enlarged in 1580 
 into the large present day house,using
 stone from other buildings.Today the  
 chapterhouse,library and refectory    
 still stand.                          
    Today the influence of the Priory  
 is still seen in names.{Friary wood}  
 represents the home of lay workers.   
 The name{Charterhouse}is now linked to
