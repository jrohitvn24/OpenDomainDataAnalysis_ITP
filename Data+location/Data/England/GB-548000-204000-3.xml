		<title>03Bluemans Park</title>
		<content> Bluemans park is small.  There is a   
 small football field..There are three 
 swings and a seasaw which is made of  
 wood.  There are monkey bars, a       
 biggish climbing fram and three       
 swings.  Everything in the park is    
 made of wood.  The park has been there
 for about 6 years.  Some childrens'   
 mums and dads and other people got    
 together and thought that there was   
 not much for the children to do so    
 they raised lots of money by having   
 jumble sales and sales of ware.  They 
 pay Mr Pile Â£50 a year to rent the    
 field.  A lady called Mrs Winston is  
 the chairman of the committee to raise
 the money for the park.
