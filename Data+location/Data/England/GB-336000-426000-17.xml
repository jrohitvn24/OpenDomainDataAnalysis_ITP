		<content> Two controversial issues dominate the 
 local scene.Lytham Baths, built in    
 l86l, and radically in l928 is not at 
 the end of its life.The fabric is     
 crumbling and each year for l0 years  
 thousands of pounds have been spent in
 keeping the pool open.At present a    
 brand new Sports and Leisure Complex  
 stands virtually completed but        
 unopened.The Council were unable to   
 fund such a scheme."JASPA LTD."a      
 private firm said they could provide  
 this facility for half the Council's  
 estimate.Jaspa,however,went into      
 bankcruptcy with Â£250,000 of work to  
 be done.If the old Baths close this   
 year there will be no swimming in the 
 Borough until Autumn l986 when the St.
 Annes Baths Complex should be opened. 
{"Leafy Lytham"}ravaged by Dutch Elm   
 disease.Replanting policy by Civic    
 Society and Council inadequate. {     </content>
