		<title>05BOARDING SCHOOL LIFE 1985</title>
		<content>  Unlike most people's opinions of     
 boarding schools, they are not like   
 prison camps, nor, on the other hand, 
 are they like Mallory Towers.         
  Whilst having the advantage of the   
 expansive grounds, one has to live by 
 strict routine. Forced out of bed by a
 bell at 7:15,there follows a mad rush 
 to the dining_rooms for 8:00,assembly 
 at 9:00 and then lessons until 4:10,  
 with a break for lunch. By lunch_time 
 most people are ready to eat anything 
 and rush over to the dining_rooms     
 after having made a detour to see     
 whether any letters await them.       
 Prep is done from 4:30 _ 6:15 and     
 again after supper, and then there is 
 free time.We go to bed according to   
 age but do not go to sleep at once.   
  It provides an interesting life,but  
 to understand it,one has to be a      
 resident.                             </content>
