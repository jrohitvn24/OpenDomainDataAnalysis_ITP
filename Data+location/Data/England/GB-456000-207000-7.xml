		<content>Stanton Great Wood is 150 acres of     
 ainly dicidnous trees (about 1000 to  
an acre).There are Munt deer and       
backing deer and fallow deer.Every year
some deer are shot to keep the numbers 
down.They have made a new plantation in
the wood and it has a special fence    
around it for rabbits and it goes under
gound to stop them burrowing and it has
a high fence for the deer.The          
plantation is planted in lines of soft 
wood and hard wood trees because in the
time one hard wood tree can be grown   
two soft wood trees can be grown.      
Sometimes there are too many trees so  
the woodman has to thin them out by    
cutting down the bad ones and letting  
the stronger ones grow. One woodman    
looks after 300 acres. There are 4     
wooden high seats in the wood where the
man looks over the forest. In 1976     
a fire burned fields near the wood     </content>
