		<title>08Thoby Priory</title>
		<content>    Thoby Priory was founded in the    
 middle of the 12th century (King      
 Stephen's reign) by Michael de Capra  
 and is named after its first Prior,   
 Tobias.                               
    The property came into the         
 possession of the Blencowe family     
 about 1720. The Priory was demolished 
 and rebuilt as a private house, using 
 some of the original materials. After 
 a serious fire in 1893, it was again  
 rebuilt.                              
    It was bought by the Earl of Arran,
 a famous newspaper columnist, in 1920.
 The Priory was demolished thirty to   
 forty years later and sadly, only two 
 arches survive from the original      
 building. The site of the Priory is   
 now in the middle of a scrap-metal    
 yard.
