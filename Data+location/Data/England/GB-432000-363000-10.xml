		<content> There are four public houses in our   
 area,The Red Lion,The Black Swan,and  
 The Crispin in Ashover and The        
 Kelstedge Arms in Kelstedge.          
 The Crispin has an interesting history
 and probably dates back from the year 
 1416 when Thomas Babington of         
 Dethick and several men of Asher      
 returned from the Battle of Agincourt 
 which was fought on St Crispins Day.In
 1646 Job Wall the landlord of the inn 
 withstood the Kings troops in the     
 doorway and told them that they should
 have no more drink in his house as    
 they had too much already.But they    
 turned him out and set watch at the   
 door till all the ale was drunk or    
 wasted.The above incident occurred    
 during the period when the troops of  
 King Charles 1st were opposing Oliver 
 Cromwells army.                       
                                       </content>
