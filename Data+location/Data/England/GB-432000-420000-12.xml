		<title>12WAKEFIELD GIRLS HIGH SCHOOL</title>
		<content> Founded in 1878 by the governors of   
 Wakefield Charities this former direct
 grant school became independent in    
 1975. It has 880 pupils from 4-18     
 coming from up to 35 miles away.      
 Wentworth House where the school began
 remains the centre of school life but 
 much new building has equipped the    
 school for modern needs. The school   
 has a strong sense of community and   
 offers a broadly based education      
 leading to O and A level examinations.
 Extra curricular activities provide   
 for most interests. Girls join        
 in sports and musical activities with 
 other Wakefield pupils. Most leavers  
 from the sixth form of 180 go on to   
 higher education. Former pupils work  
 in oil production nuclear engineering 
 and television presentation. The      
 school continues to adapt to meet the 
 needs of each generation.  Y.F.HAND   </content>
