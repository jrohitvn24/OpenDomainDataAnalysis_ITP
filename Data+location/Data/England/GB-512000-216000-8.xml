		<title>08East Hyde - The Village</title>
		<content>{East Hyde}is a quiet, peaceful hamlet 
 with the{R. Lea}meandering close by   
 and a{railway viaduct}passing over the
 valley. There are{three meeting       
{places;}the{church,}a{pub,}and the    
{village hall.}Two{services}are held in
 the church each month. The pub.,{The }
{Leather Bottle,}is cosy and people go 
 there for a chat and sometimes to     
 have a meal.                          
 There was a{school}but it{closed}in   
{1984,}and is now the{village hall,}for
 which activities are being planned.   
 There is{no shop}in East Hyde and     
 people have to travel{two miles}to    
 Harpenden or Luton for a{post office  
 or{any kind of shop.}Not even         
{newspapers}are delivered.{Buses}run   
 once an hour, so most people have     
{cars}or{motor-bikes. East Hyde}would  
 appeal to people who like a{peaceful  
{life}in the countryside.              </content>
