		<content>There are two {schools} in our area.   
Pakefield Middle School is situated at 
G.R. 532 899 and is for children aged  
from 9 to 13 years of age.  It is a    
single storey, open-plan school and was
built approximately 13 years ago.      
Behind the Middle School at G.R. 532   
901 is Pakefield Primary School.  This 
is a much older school, built in about 
the year 1908.  It is constructed of   
red brick and is two storeys in height.
Children who attend the school are aged
from 5 to 9 years and transfer to the  
Middle School. Most of the children    
who attend these schools live within a 
radius of about 1 mile of the schools, 
although some come from as far away as 
a mile and a half. Both schools are    
under the jurisdiction of the Suffolk  
Education Committee whose area office  
is situated in Lowestoft.
