		<content> Bury town centre has excellent links  
 with surrounding towns through its new
 bus/rail interchage. Frequent electric
 trains depart to Manchester; and other
 places such as Rochdale, Bolton,and   
 Burnley can be reached easily by bus. 
 Bury used to be the centre of the East
 Lancashire Railway Co. and had two    
 railway stations at Bolton St. and    
 Knowsley St. these linked Bury to the 
 above towns together with Liverpool   
 and Leeds. Today preservationists     
 using the company's old name are close
 to re-opening a stretch of line 9     
 miles long to Rawtenstall with the    
 help of G.M.C. and Rossendale Council.
 Bury is well linked to the national   
 motorway network through the M66 and  
 M62. As a result one of the main      
 industrial activities of the town is  
 distribution with I.C.I. and M &amp; S    
 having large depots.                  </content>
