This block is well served by six       
primary schools: St.Joseph's RC        
Combined, Moor Hall Combined, Little   
Sutton First, Little Sutton Middle,    
Coppice First and Coppice Middle. All  
schools have their own distinguishing  
uniform colours.                       
There are inter-school competitions    
with schools in nearby blocks in       
football, cricket, netball, rugby,     
rounders, athletics, swimming and      
chess.                                 
Sutton children generally come from a  
fairly well-educated home back-ground. 
This gives them a good start in school 
life and standards are regarded as     
high.                                  
When the children reach the age of 12+ 
they transfer to secondary schools     
which are nearby.
