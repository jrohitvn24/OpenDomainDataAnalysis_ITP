		<title>15PUDSEY MARKET AREA</title>
		<content>    Once held in a square,which is now 
 a free car-park,today the market is   
 held in a smaller area off to the side
 nearby.Tuesdays,Fridays and Saturdays 
 are market days.The 30 or so stalls   
 sell a variety of typical market      
 produce.Not all the traders are local.
 Most come from other towns.They do not
 come only to Pudsey,but visit other   
 local markets on other days.The       
 Voluntary Services building,between   
 the old and new sites,used to be the  
 fire station and a building now       
 converted to flats for single people  
 was the police station. Dances,once   
 held at the baths,also on the square, 
 are now held at the Civic Hall.This   
 building,together with the new police 
 and fire stations is sited away from  
 the town-centre in an area called     
 Farsley near to the New Pudsey Station
 on the Leeds-Bradford railway line.   </content>
