		<title>01Introduction to Gleadless</title>
		<content> The Gleadless area has developed over 
 the past two decades from an          
 extensively rural landscape and       
 economy to that of one incorporating  
 modern and prize winning architecture,
 landscaped environment and service    
 industries. The area contains a       
 multitude of housing styles,many being
 Council administered.The population   
 tends to reflect the tenure.Few       
 members of ethnic minorities live in  
 the area but this is slowly changing  
 with the increase in urban movement.  
 The area, whilst not suffering from   
 'urban decay' still posses those      
 aspects which tend to affect the      
 communities desirability and          
 commitment e.g.crime, unemployment,   
 recreation... We hope these few pages 
 will give a taste of the area as it is
 seen in 1985 by those residents.
