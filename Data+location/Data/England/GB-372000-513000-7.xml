		<content> Most women in our area are housewives,
 although a lot of farmer's wives work 
 on the farm as well, helping with     
 milking and lambing. Some women also  
 work in the NAAFI at the army camp in 
 Warcop.                               
 Most men work on the farms or on jobs 
 connected with farming, because there 
 is no other industry in our area. Some
 travel to work in other towns like    
 Appleby and Penrith or Kendal. A few  
 work at a Gypsum mine further down the
 valley.                               
 Many young people have to move out of 
 our area to live and work in towns.   
 There are some people with unusual    
 jobs like the blacksmith, the         
 signwriter, and the old peoples' home 
 warden.
