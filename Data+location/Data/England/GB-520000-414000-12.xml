     The Immingham Oil Terminal is     
 situated at the North Eastern corner  
 of the dock complex and has berthing  
 accomodation for four vessels. The    
 outer jetty can take two vessels each 
 up to 250,000 tons and the inner jetty
 two of 35,000 tons. The jetty extends 
 366 metres into the Humber and was    
 built to serve the interests of the   
 oil refineries. Oil is imported from  
 the Persian Gulf, North Africa,       
 Holland, Germany and Belgium.         
     The draught at the oil terminal is
 13.1 m which means that although      
 vessels of 250,000 tons are berthed   
 they can only be partly loaded. (about
 110,000 tons)
