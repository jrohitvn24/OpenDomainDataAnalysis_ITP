		<title>07Chesterfield Sewage Works</title>
		<content>  Chesterfield sewage is dealt with at 
 the Sewage Works in Old Whittington   
 about three miles to the north of the 
 town. It was built in 1930 and covers 
 two hectares of land. Twenty people   
 are employed there and four million   
 gallons of effluent per day are dealt 
 with. The treated liquid waste is     
 poured into the River Rother and the  
 solid waste is put on tips and fields 
 near the works.                       
  When there is an east wind blowing   
 there is a characteristic unpleasant  
 smell which drifts over Old           
 Whittington especially during hot     
 weather conditions.
