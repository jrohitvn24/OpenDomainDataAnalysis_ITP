		<title>08PEPLOW HALL ESTATE.</title>
		<content>    Originally Peplow Hall Estate      
 consisted of over 1000 acres; then in 
 1923, 5 farms on the estate were sold 
 to private buyers.  The Hall itself is
 an early Georgian Residence standing  
 in finely-timbered parklands          
 boardering onto the River Tern and a  
 man-made lake.   The large gardens are
 tended by 2 full time gardeners with  
 the gardens being open to the public  
 on 2 or 3 times a year in aid of      
{Charities.}                           
    The present Estate consists of some
 550 acres, employing 3 full time farm 
 workers, one of whom is the farm      
 manager.                              
    A gamekeeper is employed to rear   
 game birds which are then released    
 into the wild &amp; shot for sport in the 
 Autumn and Winter.
