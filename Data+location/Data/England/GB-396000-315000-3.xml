		<content>    We visited the Forestry Commission 
Office to interview the Forestry       
Manager who told us about Cannock      
Forest.                                
    The main trees grown are Corsican  
Pines which are best suited to the poor
soil and local weather.                
    The ground is prepared and the     
seedlings are planted nearly two metres
apart. After about twenty years, some  
of the trees are cut down to give the  
others more light and room. Every five 
years, more are removed, and when the  
trees are about sixty years old, the   
whole plantation is felled.            
    Other trees grown are pines,       
spruces, and silver firs and some are  
sold for Christmas trees.              
    The wood is nearly all used locally
for fencing posts, fencing panels and  
garden sheds.                          
                                       </content>
