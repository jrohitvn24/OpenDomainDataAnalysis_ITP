		<title>10      Village Halls</title>
		<content>{Wickham St.Paul Village Hall}used to  
 be in the Rectory grounds.However when
 the village lost its Rector his house 
 was sold and the village hall became  
 inaccessible.The village decided to   
 build a new hall on the Village Green,
 and had two medieval fairs to raise   
 the money. The hall and adjoining     
 cricket pavilion were built by a local
 firm and opened in Jubilee Year-a     
 wonderful community effort!           
{Great Maplestead Hall}is much older.  
 In 1888 a meeting was held to start a 
 Village Club and Reading Room.The land
 and building were given by Mr.T.Miller
 and two members of the Cracknell      
 family were on the initial            
 committee.Mr.Len Cracknell is the     
 present secretary of the Village Hall 
 Council.The club was first for men but
 in 1921 it developed into a Village   
 Hall for all local activities.        </content>
