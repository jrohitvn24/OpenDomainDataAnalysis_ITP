		<title>16THE PARISH PRIEST AT WORK</title>
		<content> Father Michael is a priest at         
 St.Paul's Church,Marton.Some of his   
 duties are taking communion           
 services,marrying people and taking   
 funerals.He also goes about the parish
 talking to the parishioners.          
 He visits Baines'Endowed School every 
 Friday  to talk to the pupils. Once he
 told us about the time when an old    
 lady phoned him up and asked him if he
 would go round to her house because it
 was haunted.He went to the old lady's 
 house and soon calmed her down.He     
 found out why her electric light was  
 flickering,why her T.V.was going on   
 and off and why there was a howling   
 noise at the door.                    
 He has been a priest at St.Paul's for 
 almost a year now and is serving the  
 community well.On Sundays he holds    
 services at 10a.m. and 11.30 a.m.and  
 gives communion to confirmed people.  </content>
