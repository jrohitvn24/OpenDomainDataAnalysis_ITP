		<title>04A CHILD'S DAY IN MARLBOROUGH</title>
		<content> I get up at 7 o'clock and then I have 
 my wash and get dressed. I usually    
 have Rice Krispies for Breakfast then 
 I get ready for school. Sometimes if  
 it's raining I come with Daddy in the 
 car. Then we sit on the mat and talk  
 about news, then we get on with our   
 work. My favourite is maths. It is an 
 hour before we have milk. When we have
 had milk we go out and have play. When
 we come in from play we listen to     
 stories, then we do another hour of   
 work. Sometimes we read. When we have 
 done our work, we have lunch. Then we 
 have another play. Then we do two more
 hours of work, then have prayers and  
 go home. Sometimes I have somebody to 
 tea or I go out and have tea.         
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
