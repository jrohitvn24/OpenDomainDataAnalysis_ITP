		<title>19PIG FARMING AT LARCHWOOD</title>
		<content>    350 sows, with their progeny,being 
 fed to approx:18 weeks,are being kept 
 to 70kg liveweight at Larchwood       
 Farm,Longville.The pigs are sold on   
 contract to Walsall &amp; Birmingham,     
 where they are used to supply the     
 fresh meat trade. The pigs are fed on 
 "brought-in" compounds, and the"muck",
 mainly in the form of"slurry",is taken
 by local farmers as a valuable        
 fertiliser for their grassland and    
 arable crops.                         
    Pig production,as with poultry,is  
 the only Agricultural Commodity not   
 supported by any major E.E.C.(European
 Economic Community)protective         
 measures;the price they make, being   
 purely a reflection of the market     
 price.Whilst the main input into the  
 pig,grain,has to be purchased at      
 inflated prices;again, because of     
 E.E.C. protective measures.           </content>
