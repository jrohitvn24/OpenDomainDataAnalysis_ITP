		<content>   In this block there are lots of     
 small{streams,}called{becks}or        
{gills,}including Aiken Beck,Whit Beck 
 and Wythe Gill.They run off the fells 
 and either join together into bigger  
 streams or flow directly into the     
 nearby{River Cocker.}There is a       
{waterfall}called Spout Force on Aiken 
 Beck which many people visit by walk- 
 ing through the forestry plantation on
 Whinlatter Pass.                      
   The water in the becks is very      
{clean,}so it goes straight to some    
 houses and farms for their{supply.}It 
 also means that{salmon,trout}and{eels 
 can live in it because they feed on   
 the insects,etc. which breed there.The
 eels and salmon swim up the River     
 Derwent from the sea at Workington,   
 then into the River Cocker at         
 Cockermouth and finally into the local
 becks and gills.                      </content>
