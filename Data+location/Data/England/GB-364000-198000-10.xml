		<title>10BERKELEY POWER STATION (2)</title>
		<content> The nuclear power station has been the
 source of much{local and national     
{controversy}throughout its troubled   
 history.                              
 It is not liked due to fears of       
{leaking radioactive gasses}into the   
 atmosphere and the pouring of possibly
{contaminated matter}into the River    
 Severn. Recently parents of Lydney    
 children were invited to tour the     
 station hoping to quosh anxieties     
 about such issues. (Lydney is on the  
 opposite river bank to the station and
 has an increased occurance of         
{leukeamia).}Every month nuclear waste 
 is transported through the nearby town
 of Berkeley. Until a few years ago it 
 was shipped out from the nearby port  
 of Sharpness, this has now stopped due
 to the efforts of{Greenpeace}and      
{Friends of the Earth,}two conservation
 movements.                            </content>
