		<title>19LIVING IN BRIDGE IN 1985</title>
		<content> I live in Bridge it is surrounded  by 
 farmland ,I like it  because it's     
 countryside. I like playing in the    
 fields. If you stand on my bed you can
 see Mr Mummery's farm . It is fun to  
 play sledging down{Mr Mummery's}hill  
 in the winter .Sometimes I go up to Mr
 Mummery's farm to get potatoes for    
 my Mum to cook for dinner .Mr Mummery 
 sometimes lets me see and pat his     
 animals. He has cows,sheep,and pigs   
 and two donkeys I like farms.         
                                       
 The old railway  is now dismantled .  
 The cubs go up there we like to go in 
 the mud.We play in the tunnel.It was  
 used for a big gun in the second world
 war.It fired 21 miles and when it     
 fired  it shattered the windows in    
 Bridge .There is a {legend}that there 
 is a ghost in the tunnel but I have   
 never seen it.                        </content>
