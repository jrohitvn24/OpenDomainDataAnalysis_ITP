  Relatives and friends can visit any  
 time of the day, and they can stayfor 
 as long as they want. The patient can 
 have an afternoon off if they wish.   
 The school isn't separated from the   
 hospital. They have two teachers who  
 are both women. They teach for some{20
 patients. The lights go out at{10 pm.}
 One child had had one of his legs made
 longer during an operation performed  
 by the local orthopaedic surgeon.The  
 leg had been stretched.Then the       
 physiotherapist came each day to give 
 him special exercises to strenghten   
 and mobolise the limb.                
    A girl of 10 had a disease which   
 stopped her from growing. She looked  
 like a 3 year old,so the surgeons were
 giving her skull and brain special    
 treatment.                            
                                       </content>
