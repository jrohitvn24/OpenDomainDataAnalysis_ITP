		<title>13LANDSLIPPING IN VENTNOR.</title>
		<content>                                       
 Ventnor probably suffers from the     
 worst urban landslipping in Britain.  
 The cause of the slipping is the gault
 clay that lies between the Upper and  
 Lower Greensand which dips gently     
 towards the sea. The slides are of the
 multiple rotational type. Blocks of   
 chalk and Upper Greensand, called     
 grabens, break away as the underlying 
 gault clay slides seaward on the Lower
 Greensand, causing the strata to tilt 
 backwards. Where the graben breaks    
 away fissures or vents are formed. The
 low cliffs are formed of clay that has
 slipped from the downs in the past.   
 Although recent landslides have been  
 relatively slight, they have caused   
 damage to roads, houses and utilities.
 Coastal protection work is taking     
 place to stop the sea aggravating a   
 potentially serious situation.        </content>
