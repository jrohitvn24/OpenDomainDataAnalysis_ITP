{Totteridge}is on the outskirts of{High
{Wycombe}in the{Chiltern Hills}and lots
 of houses are built on slopes. We did 
 a housing survey at{King's Wood Middle
{School}and out of 208 famlies 129     
 have bought their own homes and 79    
 rented them. There are 379 more people
 than bedrooms so lots of people share 
 a room. The most common house is a    
 semi-detatched and most houses have 3 
 bedrooms.There is a wood called       
{King's Wood}and it makes{Totteridge   
 more attractive. There are lots of    
 private houses and small estates of   
 expensive detached houses.{King's Wood
{Middle School}is opposite some        
 bungalows for old people. They have a 
 warden to look after them and a common
 room. A typical 3 bedroomed           
 semi-detached house costs around      
 Â£45,000 in our area.                  </content>
