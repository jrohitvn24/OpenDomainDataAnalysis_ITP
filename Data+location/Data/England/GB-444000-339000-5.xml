 which are open to the public, ranging 
 from feet to teeth.  The chemist is   
 situated inside the centre and has its
 own full-time pharmacist.  This is    
 very convient.  From Monday to        
 Saturday the Health Centre is open at 
 various times.  There are 5 permanent 
 doctors and 5 doctors who have        
 different days to work over the week. 
 Each doctor has his/her own health    
 visitor who not only looks after      
 children, but mothers as well,        
 throughout pregnancy until the child  
 is 2 years old.  They will see the    
 family at home as well as on special  
 days at the centre for weighing,      
 vaccinating, etc.  The school medical 
 services are also based at the centre.
