		<title>18BUCTON CASTLE (CONT)</title>
		<content> The remains of the camp now consist of
 a shaped rampart and ditch;the ditch  
 was originally constructed to the     
 north,east,and south east;the other   
 edges being so precipitous as not to  
 need one.The profile of the rampart   
 can be clearly seen on the skyline of 
 the valley to-day.From the camp,along 
 the side of the{Noon Sun Hill}runs a  
 road to Greenfield following the line 
 of an earlier track.This was paved by 
 the Romans,and many sections are still
 in existence to-day;the heavily rutted
 stone paving slabs are evidence of a  
 heavy flow of wheeled traffic at that 
 time.Other interconnecting early      
 tracks were used to cross the valley  
 to join a Roman road which ran along  
 the summit of{Luzley Brows}and{Light  
{Birches.}This road connected          
{Castleshaw}camp more directly with    
{Mancunium,Melandra}and {Kaskenmoor.   </content>
