  There are 2 shops in the village of  
 Little Weighton. One is a Post Office 
 and general store, the other is a     
 small supermarket which sells most    
 kinds of food and many other items.   
                                       
{PUBLIC HOUSE}                         
  The village 'Pub' is called 'The     
 Black Horse'. On Sundays, when the    
 other shops are closed, you can buy   
 sweets at the pub. You have to be 18  
 years old to buy drinks like beer,    
 wine and spirits, but children are    
 allowed in with their parents.
