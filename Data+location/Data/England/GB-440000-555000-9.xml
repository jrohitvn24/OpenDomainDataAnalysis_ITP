		<title>09A Holiday weekend by Lee</title>
		<content> On Saturday we went to York for the   
 weekend to stay with my cousins       
 Jacquie and Mellisa.On Sunday morning 
 we got up and dressed and had         
 breakfast together.Then we went out to
 play.It was a sunny day and we played 
 hide and seek.At twelve o'clock we had
 dinner and at one o'clock we changed  
 for the prayer meeting.We got home at 
 5-30.We had tea.We had beefburgers,ice
 cream,cakes and sweets.After tea we   
 played out at a hotel having pop and  
 crisps.In the garden there were swings
 and there was a boat on the river.When
 we got home we had supper and went to 
 bed.
