		<title>15Quakerism in Pennington</title>
		<content>  The Quakers were a religious group,  
 also known as Friends.The Quakers held
 Meetings.They did not have talks,or   
 sing,at their Meetings.They would pray
 to God in their minds and wait for    
 God's presence to enter them.         
  They wore simple black clothing.They 
 would not fight,but they helped the   
 injured and they helped refugees.     
  Sometimes they would be thrown into  
 prison for their beliefs.When a war   
 was on and people asked them to fight 
 for their country and they would not, 
 other people teased and threatened the
 Friends.                              
  Some Quakers emigrated to            
 Pennsylvania,USA because they were    
 treated so badly.Many left to escape  
 persecution and some left because of  
 the high taxes,such as the light tax  
 and the hearth tax.
