 15 The land is part of a privately    
 owned estate with one small village, a
 castle and some farms. Some farms are 
 farmed by the estate and others are   
 let to tenant farmers. There is one   
 dairy farm and the others are mixed   
 farms. With changing farming methods  
 many of the houses are not needed for 
 farm workers, so many house retired   
 workers. The estate employ people to  
 maintain all open areas around the    
 village which means it is always very 
 attractive. It is a well-wooded area  
 and the estate forestry department is 
 an important part of the estate work. 
 The castle is used as a field studies 
 centre by Northumberland Education    
 Authority. During the summer months   
 many day tourists visit the area.
