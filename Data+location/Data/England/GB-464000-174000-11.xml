		<content>  The western edge of Tilehurst is     
 growing rapidly,covering agricultural 
 land and open spaces.                 
  A mixed type of housing in high      
 density is now being built.           
 Semi_detatched,Detatched,Maisonettes, 
 Bungalows and Town Houses,(terraces)  
 are the kind that are being put up    
 now.The houses are being built of     
 traditional brick and tile.But in     
 certain parts a new style of          
 construction is developing.A timber   
 frame in a wall with plaster board    
 backing insulated with 9cm of thick   
 fiber,backed by 8mm of plywood.This is
 covered with a special breather paper.
 Outside this insulated "sandwich" is  
 built the conventional brick outer    
 face leaving a normal cavity.         
 The roof,(well insulated,)is again of 
 tile.This creates an energy factor of 
 0.3(u value)which is an improvement.  </content>
