		<content>   The present{Parish Council}was      
 formed in 1972. Elections of seven    
 councillors are organized by Malvern  
 District Council every 4 years.       
{Meetings}are held every three months  
 with occasional extra meetings about  
 planning applications.                
   A chairman and vice-chairman are    
{elected}annually at the A.G.M. Each   
 councillor also has a particular area 
 of responsibility as regards parish   
 life and welfare. A salaried clerk is 
 appointed on a permanent basis to     
 minute meetings, do correspondence and
 act as treasurer. The accounts are    
 audited externally every three years. 
  {Contact is made}with neighbouring   
 parish councils. The County Council   
 and District Council also keep the    
 Parish Council informed about relevant
 matters. The County Association of    
 Local Councils is also helpful.       </content>
