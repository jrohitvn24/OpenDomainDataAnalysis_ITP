		<title>18CRAZIES HILL SCHOOL VISIT</title>
		<content> There are many sources from which one 
 can extract information. Curricular   
 activities away from school can be a  
 starting point for a study or can     
 enhance a project already begun. day  
 visits provide practical information  
 and experience in specific areas,     
 while residential visits give a more  
 varied experience, socially &amp;         
 academically. To see a dredger at work
 is better than only to read about it. 
{Vernon's Visit to Canute House, Poole}
 I liked pottery with Russell best. I  
 liked plunging my hands into the gooey
 clay. Although I made a mess of it    
 like I am always making a mess of     
 things it was great fun. Making models
 is not easy, after all. Mr Lambert    
 helped me with my coil pot, but he    
 made a mess of his wheel pot. My pot  
 came out{WELL} in the end, and        
 nobody's pot exploded.                </content>
