		<content>  It is proposed within the next few   
 years to renovate and also build a    
 small new development in the area of  
 old original cottages between the two 
 main streets. The new houses will be  
 mainly one and two-bedroomed flats and
 maisonettes designed for single people
 and young married couples. They will  
 incorporate the traditional styles of 
 the old cottage architecture but will 
 be unusual in that they will sometimes
 have the living room upstairs and the 
 bedrooms downstairs. They will not    
 have gardens but a communal area of   
 cobbles, seats and plant containers.  
 Work has already started on this      
 proposed piece of 'urban renewal'.
