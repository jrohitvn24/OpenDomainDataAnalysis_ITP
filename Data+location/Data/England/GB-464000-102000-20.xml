		<content> Our twelve-kilometre block was divided
 between the following                 
 schools:Portsmouth Sixth Form         
 College(the computer                  
 centre),St.Lukes,City of Portsmouth   
 Boys,Lyndhurst Middle, and Langstone  
 Middle.The block covered was of mixed 
 interest, with the edges consisting of
 large areas of sea and a motorway     
 crossing the northern  part.          
 Difficulties encountered in doing the 
 survey were :schools not in the areas 
 of study,sending children out         
 unsupervised,finding teacher          
 colleagues to cover lessons,getting   
 permission for students in secondary  
 schools to miss lessons, finding time 
 to collate the findings after school. 
 The project guidelines were           
 well-documented and clear;consequently
 the project was easy  and enjoyable   
 to do.                                </content>
