		<content>Mrs Casson rises at 9.00am to let in   
the cleaners and to walk her dog before
breakfasting. She cashes up the prev-  
ious night's takings and deposits them 
at the bank in Hornby.She shops locally
for items she may have forgotten then  
helps in the pub if they are short-    
staffed.When the pub closes at 3.30pm  
she cashes up again,does housework,has 
tea and takes a bath.She works in the  
pub and restaurant from 6.00pm and does
not go to bed before midnight.Running  
a pub is very tying and leaves little  
time for family life which Mrs Casson  
explained caused her marriage to break 
up.She feels she has neglected her     
daughter.Mrs Casson has been licensee  
of the Fenwick Arms for 6 years and is 
about to move to a bigger establish-   
ment.
