		<content> I moved to Torquay on December 14th   
 1984.To start with the place seemed   
 very large and unfriendly.As I had    
 moved from Dartmoor where the         
 Community was normally friendly the   
 change was quite dramatic.After a few 
 months I met people through school and
 started to go out.I soon realised that
 there were lots of places to go and   
 different things to do.The people in  
 Torquay are not the same as on The    
 Moor.They seem more interesting which 
 is probably because there was nothing 
 for my old friends to do.The          
 difference between the schools is     
 very noticeable.In Torquay there is a 
 higher level of discipline forced upon
 the children than on Dartmoor.There is
 also a choice of schools here while on
 The Moor there was only one.Tavistock 
 Comprehensive is crowded with 2,000   
 children.Here there is less crowding. </content>
