 On Saturday 1st.June our friends went 
 back to Brighton. They left           
 Northchapel at 10.30a.m.After that I  
 watched Grandstand on television.At   
 3.00.o'clock I had my hair cut and    
 after that I went to my Nanny Burdens.
 Then I went to Lurgashall fete and the
 barn dance.We got home to bed at      
 12.40.a.m.
