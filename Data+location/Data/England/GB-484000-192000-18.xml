		<title>18700th ANNIVERSERY PROCESSION</title>
		<content>   According to the First Book of High 
 Wycombe the{first Mayor}was Roger     
 Outred in 1285. Until 1485 a mayor has
 held the office for two to three      
 years. Now he is elected annually.    
   On 30th June 1985, a{procession}took
 place to celebrate{the 700 years of   
{the Mayorality}in High Wycombe.       
   Among the many bands which attended 
 were the Royal Marines and Majorettes 
 who came from{Kelkheim,}High Wycombe's
 twin city in Germany. The procession  
 left Mill End Road, two miles from the
 town centre at 2pm. On its arrival at 
 the Rye,cups were awarded for the best
 non-commercial and commercial floats. 
   The{beating of the bounds}used to be
 a local custom. It was brought back   
 this year for the 700th anniversary.  
 The processions proceed round the     
 bounds of High Wycombe and a young boy
 is bounced to mark the spot.          </content>
