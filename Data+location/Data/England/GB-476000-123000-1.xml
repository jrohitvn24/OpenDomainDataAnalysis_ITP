		<content> The block is sparsley populated apart 
 from the extreme S.W. corner where    
 there are recently-built private and  
 council housing estates. The rising   
 countryside to the north is mainly    
 commercial woodland, both coniferous  
 and chestnut. This covers about       
 one-third of the entire block: the    
 central and southern areas are        
 predominantly used for farming - crops
 and grazing. Farming provides the main
 source of employment for the few      
 people working here. The River Rother 
 meanders west to east along low-lying 
 land in the south of the block. It is 
 unused save for occasional anglers and
 canoists. The buzy A272               
 Midhurst/Petersfield road intersects  
 the block horizontally and is met in  
 the top north-west corner by the still
 busier A3 London/Portsmouth road.
