		<title>01Area Summary</title>
		<content>  Our area is almost mainly farmland.  
 The village of Grampound,properly     
 known as Grampound with Creed is where
 we find most people.The rest of the   
 area has farm houses and hamlets but  
 Grampound has the most.               
  The River Fal runs through the area  
 and through the village and in the    
 past was one of the main reasons for  
 the village being established.Years   
 ago this river was navigable through  
 the village but this is no longer so. 
 The main A390 passes through the area 
 and through the village. This road    
 links St. Austell with Truro and is   
 always very busy so causes many       
 problems in the village as regards    
 safety and noise.                     
  We have covered the following topics 
 to show our area: education, clubs,   
 events,home life and farming.
