		<title>05HARMBY- A FARMER'S  DAY</title>
		<content>  I BEGIN AT 5.45 AM. BY BRINGING  IN  
 AND MILKING OUR 105 FRIESIAN COWS.    
 THIS TAKES UNTIL 8.00 AM. WHEN THE    
 MILK TANKER CALLS TO TAKE THE MILK TO 
 THE DAIRY.OUR FARM WORKER COMES AT    
 8.00 AM. AND FEEDS THE CALVES. AFTER  
 BREAKFAST I WASH THE MILKING EQUIPMENT
 AND MAKE BUSINESS TELEPHONE CALLS.    
  I THEN WALK ROUND THE SHEEP AND CHECK
 THAT THEY ARE ALL WELL.WE THEN LOAD   
 THE TRACTOR AND TRAILER WITH NEW FENCE
 POSTS,RAILS &amp; WIRE TO MEND BROKEN     
 FENCES OR DO OTHER SUCH JOBS.         
  AFTER LUNCH THE FARM WORKER FINISHES 
 THE FENCING AND I TAKE ANOTHER TRACTOR
 AND A LOAD OF ARTIFICIAL FERTILIZER ON
 TO THE FIELDS WHERE GRASS HAS BEEN    
 TAKEN FOR SILAGE RECENTLY.            
 AT 3.45 PM.I BRING IN AND MILK THE    
 COWS AGAIN.THE FARM WORKER FEEDS      
 THE CALVES.I FINISH WORK ABOUT 6.15 PM
