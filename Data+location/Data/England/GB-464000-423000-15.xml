		<title>15Carlton Towers</title>
		<content> The three storey house,19th century   
 Victorian,is now a popular tourist    
 attraction. Originally the Carlton    
 Hall of l6l4 was Jacobean style, but  
 in the late l9th Century the famous   
 architect Pugin redesigned the        
 interior to Victorian period.         
 In the outer hall the mosaic ceiling  
 panels and French style cabinets show 
 the old furniture at its best.        
 Marble steps lead between elephantine 
 piers to the inner hall.              
 Many portraits which hang in the      
 picture gallery were chosen by Ethel  
 Beaumont.                             
 There are two state bedrooms with     
 magnificent walnut furniture.         
 The oak staircase leads to a room     
 where in a cupboard a loose floorboard
 reveals the entrance to a priest's    
 hiding hole, where many priests hid   
 during the reformation.               </content>
