		<content>   Whitchurch is quite an easy place to
 get to by public transport.At the     
 moment you can travel by bus to       
 Basingstke,Andover,Salisbury and      
 Winchester.There is also a coach      
 service which runs from Southampton to
 Oxford,so you can travel to all the   
 places along that route.The most      
 frequent bus service runs fro         
 Basingstoke to Andover and this runs  
 approximately every hour.             
   There  used to betwo railway        
 stations in Whitchurch,one on the old 
 line from Southampton to Didcot,this  
 is now closed and the other is on the 
 existing line from London to          
 Exeter.The trains run quite           
 frequently,you can catch a train about
 every two hours in either direction.  
   The only problem is that the station
 is an uphill walk out of the town.
