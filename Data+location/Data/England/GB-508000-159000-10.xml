		<title>10COBHAM SURREY - SHOPPING</title>
		<content> The total number of people interviewed
 was 40. 30 of these lived in Cobham;  
 the other 10 were outsiders. 1 person 
 had come as far as 9 miles to shop.   
 Most tended to shop here 1-3 times per
 week. We found that 20 people visited 
 Waitrose most frequently, 11 visited  
 Tesco's most. Other popular shops were
 Bejams, Farrants (Newsagent), Cullens,
 the butcher and the greengrocer.      
                                       
 Out of the Cobham residents, 22 people
 spent their leisure time at home and 8
 did not. Of the 8, 4 stayed in Cobham 
 and 4 went out.
