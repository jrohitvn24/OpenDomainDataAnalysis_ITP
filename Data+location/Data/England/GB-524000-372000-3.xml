		<title>03Religion in West Ashby.</title>
		<content> The church of All Saints, said to date
 back to the 13th century, but thought 
 to have been built in the reign of    
 Henry V11, must surely have been used 
 since that time for religious worship.
 But erected in 1878 at a cost of      
 Â£1000, the Wesleyan Chapel held a     
 strong position for many years. It was
 positioned on a high bank. John Wesley
 preached in the village, having been  
 at Oxford University with the son of  
 the owner of West Ashby at that time -
 the Panton heiress. Services were     
 discontinued in 1973 and the building 
 demolished in 1977, some of the bricks
 being used in the reconstruction of   
 Louth Methodist Church, and a bungalow
 has been built on the site. There was 
 also a Chapel for Primitive           
 Methodists.
