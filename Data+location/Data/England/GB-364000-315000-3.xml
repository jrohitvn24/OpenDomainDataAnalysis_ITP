		<title>03Landscape,The Weald Moors</title>
		<content> This is a sparsely settled            
 agricultural area.The Weald Moors,    
 formerly extensive wooded marshland   
 have been cleared and drained since   
 the 16 th century.Early complex       
 systems of channels(strines) were     
 simplified and improved in the 19 th  
 century when a few large channels e.g 
 The Commision Drain were constructed. 
 The river Strine flows westward       
 through the NW of the sector.Roads    
 across the moors are often straight   
 but narrow and uneven,they are raised 
 above the level of adjoining fields.  
 The nucleated village of Kynnersley   
 lies on higher land,above 55 m.The    
 parish church,Manor House and five    
 farms are important features of this  
 settlement.The are approx 40 houses in
 the village,most having been built    
 during or since the 19 th century.
