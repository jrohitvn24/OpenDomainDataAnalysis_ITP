		<content> The eastern edge of the block includes
 an interesting variety of{commercial  
{development.}To the east of Frimley   
 exists a new{Industrial Estate.}Most  
 of the development is given over to   
 companies which specialise in         
{technological development}for both    
{consumer and industrial} defence      
 worlds. This is balanced at the       
 southern part of the block by the     
{older Farnborough Street area}which   
 includes a variety of{small businesses
 which have been established for up to 
{150 yrs}and includes a {baker,building
{materials co.,}and a{small sheet metal
{works.}The British Car Auctions which 
 started on their present site in {1954
 is the most interesting in that it was
 the first of its kind in the U.K. They
 currently sell {60000}cars p.a.but are
 about to move to a new site which will
 be the biggest in {Europe.}           </content>
