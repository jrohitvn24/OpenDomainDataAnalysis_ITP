		<title>16Employment In Sparham</title>
		<content> The population of Sparham is approx-  
 imately 350, of these 35 are children,
 including 3 expected babies. Of those 
 employed, about half get their income 
 from work in or around the village, of
 the rest some travel to various RAF   
 stations in the district some are     
 taken 5 miles daily by coach to Great 
 Witchingham Hall where they are       
 employed by Bernard Matthews PLC,     
 world famous turkey breeders and      
 processors. The remainder work in     
 Norwich or other small towns in the   
 district.                             
 About one quarter of the people living
 in Sparham are retired; this quiet    
 area of Norfolk in the Wensum valley  
 attracts many over 60's from London   
 and other areas to invest in property 
 and settle down to enjoy a pleasant   
 retirement.
