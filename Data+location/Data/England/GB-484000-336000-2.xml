		<content> Barrowby Church and School and the old
 part of the village situated on top of
 this escarpment. From this point wide 
 views of the Lincoln Edge can be seen 
 as far as Lincoln and its cathedral.  
 The rest of the D block stretches     
 North and West from the escarpment    
 onto the gravel and alluvial soils of 
 the valley of the River Trent.        
 Sedgebrook is situated in the vale at 
 the foot of the escarpment.           
                                       
 The area is served by one main trunk  
 road (A.52) and several minor roads.  
 There is a railway line (Grantham to  
 Nottingham) crossing the block from   
 East to West.                         
                                       
 The area is covered mainly by highly  
 productive agricultural land - the    
 chief land use being for arable crops.
