		<title>15ATTITUDES IN BIRMINGHAM.</title>
		<content> WE INTERVIEWED MANY PEOPLE IN OUR     
BLOCK TO FIND OUT THEIR OPINIONS.      
MOST SEEMED TO LIKE BIRMINGHAM AND     
OUR AREA SAYING THERE WERE MANY        
FACILITIES AND THAT IT WAS A FRIENDLY  
COMMUNITY.                             
 THERE WERE SOME CRITICISMS,MOSTLY     
ABOUT VANDALISM,LITTER AND             
UNEMPLOYMENT.                          
 THE PEOPLE ARE OF ALL DIFFERENT       
RELIGIONS,COLOUR AND AGE.SOME LIVE     
IN LARGE HOUSES,OTHERS IN FLATS,SOME   
ARE RICH SOME ARE POOR.                
 IN OUR SURVEY WE DISCOVERED THAT      
PEOPLE PUT A LOT OF VALUE ON           
POSSESSIONS.NEARLY ALL THE FAMILIES    
HAVE A WASHING MACHINE,HAIR DRYER AND  
FRIDGE.OVER 50% OF THE FAMILIES HAVE   
CARS,BUT ONLY ABOUT 10% HAD MORE       
THAN ONE.                              
                                       
                                       </content>
