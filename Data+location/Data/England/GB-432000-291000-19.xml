		<title>19The Nuneaton Mosque</title>
		<content>  Nuneaton{Muslims}used to pray in     
{Riversley Park,}but as their numbers  
 swelled they persuaded the local      
 council to allow them to convert two  
 houses in{Edward Street}into a mosque.
  In 1976 they acquired a piece of land
 in{Frank Street}on which to build a   
 new mosque. The architect was{Mr.R.A. 
{Zaki}who was born in Iraq, but        
 educated in London. It took 5 years to
 build as work stopped for 1 year due  
 to a shortage of funds. The total cost
 was Â£793,890.                         
  The Mosque faces{Mecca,the Holy City,
 and is said to be one of the finest in
 the country. More and more Muslims are
 coming to Nuneaton just to pray in    
 this mosque.                          
  Other facilities include a kitchen,  
 library, guestroom and classrooms     
 where local children attend lessons   
 for 2 hours each weekday evening.     </content>
