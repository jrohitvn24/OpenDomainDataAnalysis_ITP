		<title>16QUINTRELL DOWNS</title>
		<content>  The{PRINTERS OFFICE}has been in      
 Quintrell Downs since 1972.It was     
 previously a chapel which was built   
 113 years ago.The printer owns        
 machinery worth up to Â£1500 and his   
 working day starts between 7-00 and   
 8-30am.                               
   Quintrell Inn is 300 years old and  
 ceased brewing its own beer in the    
 early part of this century.Mr Burn the
 manger sells 600 barrels of beer a    
 year,mostly in the summer when he has 
 to use more staff because of the      
 holiday business.                     
   The village is built on a crossroads
 now converted into a roundabout.This  
 has considerably eased the traffic    
 congestion which occurred particularly
 in the holiday season where the main  
 road from Summercourt meets the one   
 from Indian Queens.
