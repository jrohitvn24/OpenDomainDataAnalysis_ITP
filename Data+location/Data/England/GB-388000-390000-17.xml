 _________________________             
                                       
{Shopping}plays an important part in   
 our everyday life. Manchester and     
 Stockport have extensive shopping     
 facilities but we try to use our{local
{shops}in Heaton Chapel.               
                                       
 We{interviewed}many local people. They
 all shopped in Stockport, but only    
 half went to into Manchester. Nearly  
 everyone shopped locally, often making
{several journeys}during the week.     
                                       
 We counted{seventy-one shops and      
{businesses.}When asked about improving
 the area, many people suggested a{shoe
{shop}and wished the shops to remain   
{open at lunchtime.}They also wanted   
 easier and safer{crossing places}for  
{pedestrians.                          </content>
