		<title>14Recreation around Harberton</title>
		<content> For many people, particularly the     
 older members of the community,       
 recreation has to be home based,      
 centered around the television and the
 garden.                               
 There is a social club with a bar and 
 billiards table with the only         
 meeting room in the village above it. 
 Here the Youth Club, W.I., adult      
 education classes and ballet classes  
 meet and it is here that all the      
 village social events are held.       
 Other recreational activities are many
 and varied and those people involved  
 often travel outside the area to      
 pursue their interests, including     
 sports.                               
 The public house although an          
 attractive old building in the heart  
 of the village is not greatly used by 
 the locals.                           
                                       </content>
