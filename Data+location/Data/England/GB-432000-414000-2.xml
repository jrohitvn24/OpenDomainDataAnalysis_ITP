		<title>02Housing in South Wakefield</title>
		<content>     The northern part of our area,    
 which is nearer to Wakefield, has many
 types of housing of many ages.        
     The Kettlethorpe Estate covers a  
 square kilometre and is very much     
 typical of any council estate -       
 composed mainly of semi-detached      
 houses.  There are many open spaces   
 but little in the way of amenities.   
     The Pledwick area contains        
 post-war housing much of it detached  
 and high priced.  This area developed 
 to cater for the needs of those who   
 wanted to live in pleasant            
 surroundings but have good access to  
 the major towns and cities of West    
 Yorkshire and South Yorkshire.        
     Newmillerdam alone maintains its  
 old charm and character although there
 has been some development here also.  
     At one time houses in this area   
 were isolated. Many remain run down.  </content>
