		<content>{   St. Cuthbert's}is built on the site
 of an earlier Methodist chapel. The   
{Independent  Methodists}have their    
 own chapel which was built in 1965.   
{   St.Patrick's}was built in 1915 to  
 accommodate the growing numbers of    
 Roman Catholics. The school was built 
 in 1926. The present parish priest is 
 the Rev. W. Elkin.                    
    Although there are a number of     
 Christian churches in Ryhope it could 
 not be said that the majority of      
 people attend a church. It appears    
 that many people do not find any need 
 for organised religion today.
