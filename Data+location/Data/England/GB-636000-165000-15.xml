		<content> In Ramsgate there are many churches   
 most of which are Church of England   
 .St.Lawrence unlike most other        
 churches in the area has a tower and  
 was built by monks from Minster in    
 1062.Normally there is a congregation 
 of 120-150 on Sundays with 24 services
 weekly.St.George's is the largest     
 church in Thanet with an imposing     
 spire and very large clockface.The    
 congregation of 90-120 is small for   
 its size but it is in the middle of   
 town.St.Luke's and Christchurch are   
 the other 2 parishes.The main Catholic
 church of St.Ethelbert's is small but 
 has the largest congregation(240 on   
 Sundays).The mass is enacted 9 times  
 weekly.Other churches include         
 Pentecostal,Methodist and the         
 Salvation Army.The only synagogue in  
 Thanet is used by the few Jews in     
 Ramsgate on the Sabbath(Saturday).    </content>
