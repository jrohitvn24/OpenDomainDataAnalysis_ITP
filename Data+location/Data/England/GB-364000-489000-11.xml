		<content>      About a mile out of Sedbergh on  
 the Hawes road there is a home for the
 elderly called{Beamsmoor}which        
 has expanded over the past twelve     
 months.  There are eighteen residents 
 with seventeen staff to look after    
 them (although they are not all there 
 at the same time). Most of the        
 residents are local people who like   
 living there and there is a long      
 waiting list of people wanting to go  
 in.                                   
      {Oakdene}is a hotel nearby and   
 there we met the lady who owns it with
 a partner.  She told us that they have
 four part-time employees and they can 
 cater for up to fourteen guests at one
 time.  They also cater for local      
 parties, wedding receptions and       
 funerals.  A lot of their trade is    
 dependent on tourists travelling from 
 the Lake District to the Dales.       </content>
