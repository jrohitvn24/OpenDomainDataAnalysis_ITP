		<title>17INDUSTRY IN THE AREA (part3)</title>
		<content> Old industries in the area include a  
 brush works,a firm making bungs for   
 beer barrels,the maltings and a       
 chemical works which now makes        
 insecticides.More modern firms        
 include one making sports cars,several
 firms making fitted bedroom and       
 kitchen furniture,2 firms which found 
 a use for waste ash from the Thornhill
 Power Station and started making      
 concrete blocks used by the building  
 trade and a firm making all types of  
 furniture.Modern industrial units have
 been and are been constructed on an   
 industrial site at Ravensthorpe.Some  
 of these units are occupied by haulage
 and furniture firms.It is interesting 
 to see that most of these modern      
 buildings are designed to accommodate 
 small and very small firms.Many       
 small firms prefer older buildings &amp;  
 small overheads to modern premises.   </content>
