		<title>10My House and Its Garden</title>
		<content>    My house is about 54 years old. It 
 is built of bricks which are placed in
 a certain pattern. It is fairly large 
 and has a garden of a third of an     
 acre. The garden used to go right down
 to the station, but now we have a     
 hedge and there is a house built on   
 the other side of it. In our back     
 garden we have two patios, rose       
 bushes, honeysuckle, four apple trees,
 a hedge of cypress trees, mint,       
 sunflowers, marigolds, carnations and 
 many other plants. In our front garden
 we have a patio, a weeping willow, a  
 sycamore tree, rose bushes, a hawthorn
 hedge and two buddleia trees. My house
 used to be called "The Sycamore"      
 because of the sycamore tree in the   
 front garden which overhangs the road.
