		<content> On Coronation day, 1953, the houses   
were decorated with paper flowers all  
different colours.They were stuck all  
over the houses and there were ropes   
from house to house with triangles of  
different coloured cloth. On the top   
of the doorways they had crepe paper   
with a picture of the Queen in the     
middle and EIIR either side. Inside    
the windows there were ropes hanging   
down with red white and blue things at 
the end.Villagers had home parties, on 
Sundays they had a midday dinner but   
for tea they had sandwiches and        
afterwards they had jelly,ice cream    
and cakes. Every morning  people had   
porridge for breakfast.At Faber School,
where the boys wore shorts,the pupils  
were taught by nuns who also used the  
cane.The local railway had steam       
trains,which could be noisy and dirty, 
but the track was lifted 20yrs ago.    </content>
