		<content>  ST .LAWRENCES CHURCH                 
 St Lawrences Church was built about   
 100 years ago.The Church is Anglican  
 which is nearly the same as a Catholic
 church apart from the way the Church  
 is set out.The altar is set right back
 and the priest has his back to the    
 congregation.The choir isn't in a loft
 but is at the front,sideways on,with  
 the pews like any other church, in    
 rows.The stained glass windows are    
 about as old as the church apart from 
 from the ones in St Mary's Chapel     
 which have St Cecelia and her choir of
 angels on them.In St.Lawrence's Parish
 there are about 7000 parishioners.The 
 church is one of the biggest parish   
 churches in York.It is often called   
 The Minster Without The City Walls.The
 spire can be seen from all around the 
 area.In the churchyard stands the     
 tower of the medieval church.         </content>
