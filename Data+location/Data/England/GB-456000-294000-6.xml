 Our survey to find out what kind of   
 food children in Countesthorpe eat:   
   We found out that most have cereals 
 for breakfast,that is probably because
 children don't leave themselves time  
 for a big breakfast in the morning.   
 And 30% don't have breakfast at all.  
                                       
   50% of the children have chips as   
 their main food.This isn't surprising 
 because there are 2 chip shops in the 
 area.                                 
   90% of the children didn't have to  
 go out for their food every day,      
 having a freezer to store it.         
   Apart from water, Coca Cola and     
 lemonade are the main drinks.         
                                       
                                       
   In my opinion this is a disgusting  
 diet.                                 </content>
