		<title>06FARMERS OF WARE PARK, WARE</title>
		<content> Bardon Farm,covering 150 acres of Ware
 Park, has 50{Friesian cows}which graze
 in fields by the farm. Milking at 6.00
 and 15.45 takes 1\ hours and 1 hour to
 clear up. Most of the cows calve just 
 before winter when milk fetches a high
 price. 29{heifers}graze about one mile
 away by the River Lea.{Rye,Timothy and
{Lucerne}are grown for silage and three
 other fields grow{barley and wheat.   
   Adjoining Bardon Farm is a{Carmelite
{monastery}where nuns grow their own   
 food. They drive a small tractor which
 sometimes needs mending by neighbours.
 Although a closed order, the nuns have
 some contact with outsiders. Last May,
 Rome reaffirmed the 1977 charter,which
 allowed outside trips and newspapers. 
   Some of the monastery's land is used
 by{Ware Park Farm}for cereal crops.The
 farmer also keeps sheep and rears game
 birds for shooting in the parkland.   </content>
