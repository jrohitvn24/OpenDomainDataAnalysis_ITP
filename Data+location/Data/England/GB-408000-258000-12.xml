		<content>      Coughton Court is an interesting 
 building which attracts lots of       
 tourists. The Throckmorton family has 
 lived there since 1409, but the house 
 now belongs to the National Trust.    
      Coughton Court  has around 20,000
 visitors a year, so you can see that  
 it is very popular. Most foreign      
 visitors come from the U.S.A. and     
 Australia. There are many attractions.
 Most people come to see the furniture,
 the paintings and the tapestries.     
 There are even china dishes on the    
 walls of two rooms.                   
      The house has some interesting   
 historical stories. One member of the 
 Throckmorton family had a coat made   
 out of sheep wool in one day. There   
 are 3 priest holes. One is really dark
 and smelly and it goes a very long way
 down. Coughton Court also has         
 connections with the Gunpowder Plot.  </content>
