		<title>01Southend:The Area</title>
		<content>{Southend-on-Sea},a seaside resort on  
 the Thames Estuary was popularised in 
 Victorian days.Now it is a busy ,     
 generally residential area with a     
 large shopping centre, a seafront with
 arcades and hotels and the famous     
 pier.                                 
 Parks and sports clubs in the area    
 cope for the sporting needs of the    
 residents and the beach attracts      
 people in the heat of the summer.Two  
 railway lines to London and an        
 extensive bus service provide the     
 people of Southend with ample public  
 transport for journeying to and from  
 work, school, and to commute.         
 As the Priory of Prittlewell grew the 
 south end adopted the name            
 "Southend".Since the end of the last  
 century the whole town has been known 
 as{"Southend-on-Sea".}
