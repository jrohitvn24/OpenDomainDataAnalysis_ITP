		<content> Saunton Sands is just off our 12km    
 block but it is one of the largest    
 stretches of firm, hard sand in Great 
 Britain. Recently, the 3rd annual sand
 yachting world champions were held.   
 The races came into our study area    
 near{Airy Point. }The Sand Yachts used
 were just like Windsurfing boards but 
 were mounted on wheels.               
   Competitors from all over Europe    
 took part. The "yachts" can travel up 
 to eighty miles per hour if conditions
 are right. The sportsman wear         
 protective helmets and knee, elbow    
 and shoulder pads in case they fall   
 off the yachts. Unlike the old        
 fashioned Sand Yachts which had a seat
 and steering mechanism, these boards /
 yachts are manouvred by shifting body 
 weight and moving the sail. As this   
 type of sport is performed standing up
 it could be quite dangerous.          </content>
