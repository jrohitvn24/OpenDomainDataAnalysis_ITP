 produced for the meat market.The birds
 are bought in as day old poults or    
 chicks and fattened for the table.    
 Turkeys range in size from 10-40lb.   
 and broiler chickens up to 6lb.approx:
 In a twelve month period they rear    
 approx: 40,000 turkeys and 750,000    
 chickens which are kept in over       
 128,000 sq.ft.of housing.They are sold
 either through wholesalers or to      
 individual butchers.All chickens go   
 alive but 85% of the turkeys they kill
 themselves.Catering birds are sold    
 from April onwards and 50% of these go
 ready dressed.There are 8 regular     
 staff but the busiest time is prior to
 Christmas when 40 extra staff are     
 taken on for plucking the 20,000 birds
 sold.Although the birds are fed       
 automatically some days begin at 4a.m.
