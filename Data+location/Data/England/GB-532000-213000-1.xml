		<title>01WARE, HERTFORD AND BENGEO</title>
		<content> Ware and Hertford are small, adjoining
{market towns,}surrounded by attractive
 farmland.Bengeo forms part of Hertford
 but is separated by Hartham Park.There
 are pleasant walks along three{rivers}
 or a{canal}and through{woods}or{parks.
 The area is a rich source of{sand and 
{gravel}which is extracted before the  
 land is returned to{agriculture.      
 Although the{industry}is not dominant,
 there is low unemployment. Many people
 work out of the area. Some commute to 
 London or other large towns.          
 The built-up areas are quiet, peaceful
 communities.New{houses}are being built
 on suitable sites, though people are  
 keen to preserve the{Green Belt.}There
 are no cinemas or large sports centres
 but there are several{clubs}to join.  
 It is a good place to live because of 
 the{countryside and fresh air,}and you
 are never far from a large town.      </content>
