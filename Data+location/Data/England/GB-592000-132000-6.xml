		<content> Children went to{school}in the        
 morning.  They had very little        
 equipment and few books.  They had air
 raid shelter practices every week.    
 They took sandwiches for lunch.  For  
 punishment,  they had the cane.  They 
 had no uniform, but the girls wore    
 pinafores to protect their dresses,   
 tall button up boots and straw hats.  
 All boys wore caps. On 1st May, they  
 danced around the Maypole.            
 People{travelled}by horse and cart or 
 bicycle.  If you were less lucky, you 
 walked.                               
 Children{played}with china dolls and  
 wooden train sets.                    
{Houses}were heated by open fires.     
 People listened to gramophones.  In   
 Winter, children went to sunday school
 in the morning, afternoon and evening,
 but they only went in the evening in  
 the Summer.                           </content>
