		<title>04THE GROWTH OF FENCE</title>
		<content> Since the bypass was built,the village
 has grown rapidly.Before the bypass   
 there were about one hundred houses   
 altogether.The terraced houses        
 are grouped together on the main      
 road.Most of the semi-detached houses 
 are also on the main road but some are
 on the estates with the detached      
 houses.Fence is still growing and     
 there are plans for more estates.The  
 most notable buildings in Fence are   
 the pubs,the church of England,the    
 Methodist church,Green Slate,the      
 Mill,the shops and the school.The     
 oldest building in Fence is           
 Hoarstones and it dates back to the   
 1700's.There are three pubs and one   
 mill which makes upholstery for       
 furniture.Green Slate is a craft shop 
 that makes clocks,penholders,etc,out  
 of green slate.The Methodist school   
 and the church was built in 1867.     </content>
