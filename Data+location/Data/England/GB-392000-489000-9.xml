		<content>  There are two playgroups, one in     
 Askrigg and one in Bainbridge. This   
 situation is duplicated by the primary
 schools, both of which are Church of  
 England Voluntary Controlled Schools. 
 Bainbridge School occupies premises   
 built in 1964, but Askrigg occupies   
 its original premises and is due to   
 move into the Yorebridge Grammar      
 School premises on the outskirts of   
 the village. The nearest secondary    
 school is at Leyburn, 13 miles away,  
 to which the students travel by coach.
               ----------              
 The elderly play an active part in the
 life of the community. Bainbridge has 
 an old people's home called High Hall 
 and a sheltered housing development of
 flats and bungalows known as Sycamore 
 Close. Askrigg has an 'Abbeyfield'    
 house, a group of flats for elderly   
 folk, with a resident warden.         </content>
