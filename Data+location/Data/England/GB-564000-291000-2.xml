		<content>   The deeper peats are cropped with   
 salad crops, celery, leeks and        
 potatoes and the shallower peat with  
 wheat, potatoes and sugar beet.       
   there is an almost total absence of 
 trees with the exception of some      
 shelter hedges of willow. The Poppylot
 Road is notoriously uneven due to     
 subsidence, and during the last twenty
 years has had to carry an increasing  
 amount of traffic, especially heavy   
 beet lorries during the winter months.
   Public transport through the area is
 almost non existent, one bus          
 travelling to Ely and back on         
 Thursdays. School children are taken  
 to Southery and Downham Market by bus 
 daily. Milk is delivered three times a
 week, and bread etc. twice or three   
 times a week.
