		<title>04ASHDOWN FOREST PLANT LIFE</title>
		<content> The uncultivated land is covered by   
 Grass, Heather (3 varieties) and      
 Bracken, which predominates and       
 increases after fires. Trees grow in  
 clumps or coppices and are principally
 Pine, Silver Birch and Rowans with a  
 few Oaks and Sweet Chestnuts. There   
 are both Dwarf and European Gorse. In 
 the wet heathland Rushes, Bog Asphodel
 and several varieties of Sphagnum Moss
 flourish. Wild flowers are not        
 prolific but many kinds can be seen,  
 including Tormentil, Hawkbit, Devil's 
 Bit, Scabious, Heath Spotted Orchids  
 and Harebells by the road verges.     
 Cotton Grass, Mountain Fern           
 Bilberries, Blackberries, Gawltheria, 
 Shallon and Honeysuckle are common.   
 While access to the Forest is free,   
 the Forest Code is to admire and      
 photograph but never to dig up plants 
 and to be sure not to damage trees.   </content>
