		<title>20THE AREA-Steep to Hawkley 2</title>
		<content> The extent of the activity can be seen
 in the various strata that are visible
 in the scarp along its length. Dotted 
 around the area are many small copses.
 Being on chalk,there are many springs 
 &amp; streams and in the clay ground below
 the scarp, marshes. The highest point 
 in the district is about 250m above   
 sea level-the lowest about 75m. South 
 of the scarp, tucked away in the folds
 beneath the hangers lie many secluded 
 houses-among them Ashford Chace- built
 in the mid 19th century as the gentry 
 moved into the area.It's always been  
 (&amp; still is) a popular spot for Naval 
 officers to live in &amp; retire to(Ports-
 -mouth is not far away) &amp; several were
 built for this reason.Elsewhere, old  
 buildings are often of brick &amp; timber 
 frame construction-tiled or thatched- 
 and some are of considerable age &amp;    
 interest.Come &amp; see for yourself....  </content>
