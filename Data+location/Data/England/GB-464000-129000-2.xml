		<title>02An old Ropley family</title>
		<content> My family's connections with Ropley go
 back to January 1873 when my great,   
 great grandmother,Miss E A Kelly came 
 to the village as Mistress of Ropley  
 School.She only stayed at school for a
 short time as she then married Mr Hale
 the village blacksmith and undertaker.
 My great grandmother, grandmother and 
 mother were all born in Ropley. Life  
 was very different when they were all 
 young. When my mother came to school  
 there were only 3 classes in what is  
 now our hall and kitchen. School meals
 were delivered by van to the village  
 hall and toilets were wooden huts with
 buckets which were emptied every day. 
 Very few people had cars but there    
 were four shops and a post office so  
 people didn't need to go out of the   
 village. I like Ropley very much and I
 would like to spend my life here but  
 that will depend on the work I do.    </content>
