		<content> The three reservoirs, Butterley,      
 Blakeley and Wessenden Old all have   
 earth dams and are filled by the rain 
 water running off the surrounding     
 hillsides and moors.  The rain water  
 makes its way via streams into the    
 reservoirs and between them they store
 upto 2,272 thousand cubic metres(tcm) 
 of water at any one time.             
   Any water which cannot be stored in 
 these reservoirs goes back into the   
 stream and down into the River Colne. 
 The water authority also has to       
 compensate the water supply into the  
 River by putting back 8.07tcm. per day
 from the water stored in the          
 reservoirs.                           
   The water in these reservoirs is    
 sent along pipes and catchments to    
 Longwood treatment works.  It is also 
 pumped to Deer Hill and Blackmoorfoot 
 Reservoirs to top up their supplies.  </content>
