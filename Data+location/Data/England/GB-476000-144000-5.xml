		<title>05HOP GROWING</title>
		<content> The land to the North of the A31 is an
 outcrop of the{Upper Greensand}and has
 been used since about 1600 for quite  
 intensive hop production. Grown in    
{"Gardens"}protected by tall handsome  
 quickset hedges with their trellis of 
 poles and wires that dominated the    
 landscape.                            
 Within the last ten years the acreage 
 under hops, has rapidly declined, due 
 largely to the increasing production  
 of chemical beers. The once hop       
 gardens are now used for cereals or   
 rape seed with cattle and sheep on the
 managed grassland.                    
                                       
 The history of this interesting crop  
 is well recorded and exhibited in the 
{Curtis Museum in Alton.}
