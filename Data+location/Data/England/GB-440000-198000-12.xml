		<title>12John Blandy School</title>
		<content> The L.E.A. primary school is housed in
a modern building dating from 1968. It 
was extended when two new classrooms   
were added on to accomodate a rise in  
the village and child population.It has
150 children at the present time in 5  
classes.Over the past few years it has 
involved parents and villagers in the  
education of young children.The        
children are responsible for this      
survey.                                
 The school is partly governed by the  
John Blandy Trust.This originates in   
the 17th Century when John Blandy set  
aside monies for the establishment of a
shool for the village children.It has  
been housed in different buildings.What
is now the scout H.Q.was one such      
building.It had 72 children in 2       
classes.Children had to walk to the    
village hall for their lunch.Toilets   
were outside.Heat came from coal fires </content>
