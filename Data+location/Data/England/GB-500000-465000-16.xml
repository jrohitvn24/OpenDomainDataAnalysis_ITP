		<title>16Langtoft Parish Council</title>
		<content> The Parish Council has eleven members 
 and Mrs Wilkinson is the clerk. Mr    
 Dowson is the chairman and Mr Dixon   
 is vice chairman.The job is not an    
 every day job.It is just done when    
 it needs to be done.They look after   
 the village and keep it tidy.If a job 
 needs doing like a swing at the park  
 is broken Mrs. Wilkinson lets the     
 Council know about it. They have a    
 meeting every 6 weeks and it takes    
 place in the school.In April every    
 year anyone is allowed to go and      
 complain about things that haven't    
 been done that should have been done. 
 Every year the Parish Council has a   
 visit from the Chief Executive of the 
 East Yorkshire Borough Council to see 
 how things are getting done.
