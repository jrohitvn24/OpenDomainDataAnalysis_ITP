		<title>01PETWORTH FARMS AND PARKS</title>
		<content> The area is predominately fairly heavy
 farmland, mixed with deciduous woods  
 and some conifers. The S.W. corner of 
 the grid is the N.E. part of Petworth 
 Park, famous for its herd of Fallow   
 Deer and flock of Black Sheep. The    
 grid area contains 3 large fishing    
 ponds and lakes. The A283 runs north  
 to south through grid square number 1,
 5 and 9. All the farmland is Leconfiel
 Estate owned, some tenanted, some     
 farmed in hamd. Some of the oldest    
 farmhouses are Limbo, Guntersbridge,  
 Osiers and Palfrey which dates from   
 1327. Hunting, shooting and fishing is
 carried on over the whole area. The   
 main employment is agriculture and    
 estate forestry. There are a handful  
 of privately owned houses in the area.
 the majority of the accommodation is  
 attached to the Leonfield Estate.
