		<content> When asked if they knew of any        
 interesting places in Princetown one  
 man mentioned the names of all the    
 pubs but most people replied,"No", so 
 we told them about the church and the 
 prison.                               
   My friend and I had quite a few     
 laughs interviewing people and once we
 went over to a foreign car and said,  
 "Excuse me,we're doing the Domesday   
 Project for the B.B.C. Could you      
 answer a few questions for us please?"
 The two people who were by the car    
 started talking in another language.  
 Emma and I looked at each other and   
 said,"Thank you for your time" to the 
 people and hurriedly departed!        
   Most of the visitors were on holiday
 tour, some were walking the moors and 
 some were campers and they were all   
 kind and friendly.
