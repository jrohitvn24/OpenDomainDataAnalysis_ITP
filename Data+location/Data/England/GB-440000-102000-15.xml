 new forest. It consists of a large    
 tracks of peat heath. Bracken and     
 scrubland which is not cultivatable   
 it is not a well developed            
 agricultured area.                    
     It has an average height of       
 approximately 35 to 40 metres. The    
 soils are mainly acidic with a high   
 silica content as a result of the     
 underlying itrata (ref. geology). The 
 flora reflects the acidic nature of   
 the soils with gorse, heatiner and    
 Rhodadendroms with a varietie of wild 
 flowers in marsh and river habitats.  
     A major change in the recent      
 decades has been the "afforestation"  
 programme conducted by the forestry   
 commission.
