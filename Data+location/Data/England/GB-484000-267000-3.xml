		<title>03FARM VISITS.</title>
		<content> We visited three farms in our block,  
 all in the western half.              
                                       
{GRANGE FARM}covers 242 acres, and is  
 mainly a dairy farm with some crops. I
 has over 200 British Friesian cows    
 which yield thirty litres of milk each
 daily, for about 9 months of the year.
 The farmer grows wheat, barley and oil
 seed rape.  The farm was built in 1872
 and much expansion has taken place    
 mainly due to the modern methods of   
 farming. This farm was inherited by   
 the present family.                   
{HIGHFIELD LODGE}can be found at the   
 junction of the Wellingborough to     
 Sywell Road and Highfield Road. It    
 covers 68 acres of which 20 are used  
 for hay and 48 for grazing. this land 
 is rotated yearly. There are some 150 
 sheep and over 250 lambs were born    
 this year.                {(cont.)    </content>
