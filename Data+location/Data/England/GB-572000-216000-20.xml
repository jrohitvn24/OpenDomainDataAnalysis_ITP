		<title>20INTERVIEWING MY GRANDPA</title>
		<content> My Grandpa is 81 years old and has    
 lived  in the area all his life.He    
 started school at 5,like me,but he    
 stayed at the same school until he    
 was 14.I will leave junior school     
 at 11 and stay at my secondary school 
 until 16 or 18.He went to school at   
 9am and finished at 4pm. We start at  
 9am and finish at 3pm.In those days   
 you got the cane if you were naughty. 
 When he left school it was easy to    
 find work,now it is hard. He was paid 
 8/- for 50 hours work a week.Now you  
 would probably only work 40 hours and 
 earn about Â£120. The main road through
 the village when he was a boy was     
 gravel and stones. Then it was        
 improved. During the last war the bus 
 only ran through the village once a   
 week. When he was a boy all the work  
 in the fields was done by horses and  
 men,now it is done by machine.        </content>
