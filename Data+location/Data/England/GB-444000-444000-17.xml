		<title>17          FARMING</title>
		<content>      There are 8 farms marked on the  
 map in our area and 3 to 4 farms      
 outside but with land within. The     
 largest farm is 460 acres and the     
 smallest only 4 acres. All of         
 the farms grow a grass for hay and    
 silage.                               
                                       
      One arable farm has all but 2    
 acres devoted to cereal crops. There  
 is a lot of barley and oil seed rape  
 grown in this area. There are only two
 purely stock farms, the two smallest, 
 keeping ewes and cattle on an acreage 
 of grassland.                         
                                       
      Most farmers grow a mixture of   
 wheat, barley, oil seed rape and      
 fodder crops such as mangels and      
 turnips, as well as having permanent  
 pasture and sown grass.
