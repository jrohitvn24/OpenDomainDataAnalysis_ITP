		<content>   There is a fairly large caravan site
 situated in some old quarry workings  
 on the east side of the B5278.        
   The site has provision for over 100 
 caravans including 80 static caravans 
 and at least 30 touring caravans.     
   The site has a small toilet block   
 with washing facilities and an office 
 building with a shop and an inquiries 
 desk.                                 
   The caravan site is split up into   
 several individual emplacements and it
 stretches for some distance towards   
 Bigland Tarn.                         
   Much of the wooded area around the  
 site is well footpathed and sign-     
 posted and kept in good order for the 
 tourists.It is an attractive and      
 isolated area for walking and         
 observing the wild-life.
