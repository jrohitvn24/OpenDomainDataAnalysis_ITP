		<content>    Howick Hall was built by Sir Henry 
 Grey from designs by Newton of        
 Newcastle.The house which is a fine   
 building in the classical style was   
 enlarged and altered by the second    
 Earl Grey in 1812.It stands upon the  
 site of a small medieval tower which  
 was pulled down in 1780.              
    Howick Church stands in the grounds
 of Howick Hall. There has been a      
 chapel at Howick since the year 1158, 
 but the present church,dedicated to   
 St.Michael, was rebuilt and enlarged  
 by the third Earl Grey in 1849.       
     Longhoughton Church,dedicated to  
 St.Peter is of a much earlier date;the
 east wall of the nave dating back to  
 the Norman Conquest.The tower and the 
 aisle were built at the end of the    
 eleventh century.the chancel is       
 modern,built from the ancient stones. 
 All these buildings are worth a visit.</content>
