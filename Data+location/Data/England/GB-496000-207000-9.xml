Berkhamsted is a small town situated in
the Bulbourne Valley in the Chiltern   
Hills. It is a town steeped in history 
and noted for its castle, its old      
buildings, inns and the 1200 acre      
common adjoining the town. The earliest
settlements date back to the Iron Age, 
there is also a lot of evidence of     
Roman occuption, a Roman road in the   
area, Akeman Street and also two Roman 
villas. The castle was once one of the 
most important in the country. William 
the Conqueror's half -brother, Robert, 
Count of Mortain was its builder in    
1068. Thomas a Becket  and the Black   
Prince both spent some of their lives  
here. St. Peter's Church dates back to 
the 13th. Century, containing many fine
monuments and brasses.

buildings.                             </content>
