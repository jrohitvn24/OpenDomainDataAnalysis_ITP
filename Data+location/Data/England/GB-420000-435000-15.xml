		<title>15ROAD TRANSPORT.</title>
		<content> Though trams provided transport as    
 long ago as 1871 by 1934 they were all
 withdrawn from the Horsforth and      
 Calverley area.Private bus companies  
 have now been replaced by services run
 by The West Yorkshire Passenger       
 Transport.This includes bus services  
 between Leeds/Otley,Leeds/Ilkley and  
 Leeds/Bradford along the main A65.Also
 Leeds Metro services link Horsforth   
 and Leeds along this road.In the      
 southern part of the grid along the   
 A657 services from Leeds/Keighley and 
 Leeds/Bradford run through            
 Calverley.From north to south is part 
 of the main Leeds ring road and this  
 provides a busy commuter link between 
 Horsforth and the Pudsey Bradford     
 areas.Bus services also link Horsforth
 with Cookridge,Holt Park and the      
 Rodley and Pudsey areas.Farsley and   
 Bramley also link with Leeds by bus.  </content>
