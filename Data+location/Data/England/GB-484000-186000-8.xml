		<content>{Sir William Borlase School}is{Marlow's
 only Grammar School. It was built in  
 1624. Sir William's son, Henry, was an
 M.P. for Marlow. It was built in      
 memory of him. It has a total of 510  
 boys and 36 teachers. The original    
 school had 24 boys and girls and one  
 schoolmaster who was paid Â£12 a year  
 with a room rent free. The children   
 were chosen from the poor families.   
 They were taught rading, writing and  
 how to cast accounts. There are now   
 many more subjects to choose from. Old
 punishments were to write out bible   
 passages or they could be beaten. The 
 punishment was given in{'The House of 
{Correction'}which stood next to the   
 school.                               
          The original school had both 
 boys and girls in it and in 1987 they 
 will readmit girls. How many more old 
 customs  will they return to?         </content>
