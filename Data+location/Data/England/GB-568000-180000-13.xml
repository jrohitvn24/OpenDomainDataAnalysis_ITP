		<title>13A SCHOOL DAY AT HASSENBROOK</title>
		<content> My day usually starts at 7.15.I have  
 to get ready so that I have time to   
 meet my friends and get to school by  
 8.50.For the first half-hour we are   
 with our form tutor who takes the     
 register.We then go on to lessons,    
 which are mostly arranged in one hour 
 blocks.After the first lesson there is
 a 15 minute break.The second lesson   
 finishes at 11.45 when there is a     
 lunch break.I eat my packed lunch in  
 the Junior Dining Room.If the weather 
 is nice I may go into Stanford with my
 friends.Afternoon Registration at 1.05
 lasts for 10 minutes.I then have two  
 more lessons,separated by another 15  
 minute break.My subjects include      
 English,Maths,Geography,History,R.E., 
 Music and French.At the end of school 
 at 3.40 I play with my friends before 
 going home to do my homework.I then   
 watch television before bedtime.      </content>
