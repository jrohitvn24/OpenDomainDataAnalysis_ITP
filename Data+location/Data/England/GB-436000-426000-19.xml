 woman.She goes to work at 8-0-clock   
 and calls into the station to see if  
 there are any notes for her,she walks 
 around Woodlesford,Oulton and         
 John-o-Gaunts to see if there are     
 people doing things they shouldn't be 
 doing. Theresa can choose her own     
 shifts.She has been in the policeforce
 five and a half years.Before she came 
 to be a police lady she had to do a   
 course.She deals with glue            
 sniffers,hedgehoppers and people who  
 make a lot of noise.Gluesniffers are  
 her hardest problem at the moment.She

 sniffing.A lot of them go to          
 John-o-Gaunts subway and sniff glue   
 there.
