		<content> The area enjoys some degree of prosp- 
 erity.Most housing is owner occupied; 
 recent years have seen the growth of  
 several new out of city centre super- 
 stores in the locallity; most school  
 leavers find employment or a placement
 on a YTS scheme.  Five schools have   
 produced the survey:Down Hall and Wy- 
 burns County Primaries,Edward Francis 
 and Grove County Juniors,and Sweyne   
 Comprehensive.Each school was allocat-
 ed and surveyed a number of Km grids  
 independently,doing counts and estim- 
 ating land cover.These counts have all
 been integrated into a single set of  
 results.As for the text,each school   
 chose several topics to examine across
 the entire survey area.These are on   
 the following pages,each school enter-
 ing their own data.An index of each   
 schools surveys and their views on the
 Project appear on the final 2 pages.  </content>
