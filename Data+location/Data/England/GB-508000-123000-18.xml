		<title>18Slang in Billingshurst</title>
		<content> Old Sussex dialect words like{twitten}
 (for a narrow lane) have tended to    
 pass out of usage.{'Pumps'}for        
 plimsolls is a word that has been     
 around for some time and{'Square'}a   
 word from the late 1950's &amp; 60's,     
 meaning unfashionable, has been       
 revived. Some slang words are in usage
 because of their use by television    
 characters (eg{'Naff'}= useless or{   
{'Bottle'}= courage). Other current    
 slang words have come into usage from 
 mysterious origins (eg{'Wally'}=      
 someone who is useless or{'swivel'}=  
 go away and stop being tiresome). Some
 are inherited from America such as {  
{'Turkey'}(someone who is stupid) and{ 
{'Nerd'}(someone who is stupid!).Others
 like{'strides'}for trousers, seem to  
 have a London origin. Lack of         
 immigrants into the area has meant    
 fewer influences for change.          </content>
