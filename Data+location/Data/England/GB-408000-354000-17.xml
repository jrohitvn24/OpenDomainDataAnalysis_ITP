		<content>Oh, its not snowing again.             
Dad, can you get up and light the fire?
Ey?                                    
Oh, forget it.                         
Its freezing.  I wonder what's on      
  television?                          
I'd better switch it on then zzzzzz oh 
  no the weather's interfering with the
  television.                          
I think I'd better switch it off.      
I know, I'll make myself a hot drink.  
I'll have to fill the kettle.  Oh no,  
 the churn's empty too,                
I can't be bothered to fetch fresh     
  water.                               
Dad get out of bed will you,           
"Shut up and leave me alone."          
I'll make muself some toast, oh, I     
  forgot the electricity is off.       
In that case I'll do a crossword,      
Let's have a look .........
