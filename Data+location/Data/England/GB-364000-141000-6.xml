		<title>06ST. ALDHELM'S PRIMARY SCHOOL</title>
		<content>  The school I go to is called St.     
 Aldhelm's Primary School and is in the
 village of Doulting. It is called{St. 
{Aldhelm's}because he died in Doulting 
 during a tour of his diocese. There   
 are 104 children in the school who    
 come from{Doulting, Cranmore, Shepton 
{Mallet,Downhead, Waterlip}and         
{Chelynch.}The school grounds are      
 almost 50% grass and 50% tarmac or    
 buildings.We have an adventure play   
 ground which has tunnels, a log, and a
 slide.There is a nature area which was
 built in 1985 by some of the fourth   
 year boys and girls. In it are some   
 logs, a pond, a paved area, some trees
 and a butterfly garden. The main      
 school building was opened in 1979 on 
 the 15th November by the{Bishop of    
{Bath and Wells,}The Rt. Revd. John    
 Bickersteth.
