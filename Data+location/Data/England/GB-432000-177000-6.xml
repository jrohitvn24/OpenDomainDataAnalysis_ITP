		<title>06Mr. Taylor - Bank Manager</title>
		<content>   Mr. G. Taylor is the manager of     
 Barclays Bank. He gave Alex Barker and
 Richard Leeds a tour of the Bank. He  
 pressed in the rightone of the 9,999  
 combinations which could be used to   
 operate the airlock door (so called   
 because only one of the doors can be  
 opened at a time), and we entered the 
 till area. Here, he showed us a       
 machine which printed the money to be 
 paid on cheques; the computer, which  
 is linked to London, Gloucester and   
 Manchester. Then he showed us a thing 
 which enlarges information on peoples'
 accounts,which is printed incredibly  
 small on sheets of plastic;by shining 
 a light through it.The light along    
 with the shadow it casts,goes through 
 a lens,and is bounced onto a glass    
 screen with a mirror.
