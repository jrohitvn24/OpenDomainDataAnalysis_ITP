 and the most modern machinery on the  
 factory floor. There is a computer    
 which can read the plan of a shape and
 automatically cut that shape out of   
 steel. The giant press has a safety   
 device of a beam of light which when  
 broken cuts the machine off. They     
 sell machines for preparing land,     
 sowing and harvesting and are the 2nd

 country.They sell machines all over   
 the world - to Russia, Central
