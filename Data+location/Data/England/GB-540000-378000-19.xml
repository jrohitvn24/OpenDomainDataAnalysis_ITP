		<content> During the last decade the cylce of   
 nature has been interfered with if not
 broken by modern agricultural         
 practice, the use of{agro-chemicals}on
 a large scale &amp; the destruction of    
 tree cover. The skyline has changed   
 from{wooded}to{tree-less}acres, many  
 species have disappeared due to loss  
 of habitat. Some river{pollution}has  
 occurred and the frequent cutting of  
 roadside verges has taken a toll of   
 some wild flowers. Heavy machinery on 
 land has caused soil{impaction.}The   
 damage is becoming noticed &amp; practices
 are changing - trees are being planted
 &amp; more care taken to preserve &amp; not   
 destroy. A small section of dis-used  
 railway demonstrates natures does{re- 
{establish}herself as this has produced
 2 orchid species, many young oaks &amp;   
 ash,{birds}not previously nesting     
 here have appeared.                   </content>
