		<content> Only two general grocery stores remain
 from some six or more 25 years ago.   
 One doubles as a news agency,the other
 as a butcher.Two dairies make daily   
 doorstep deliveries and two bakers    
 call twice weekly.                    
 A salon provides for ladies and mens  
 hairdressing and the one public house 
 has a restaurant service as well as a 
 bar and off-licence.                  
 The village Post Office,saved by      
 public support, occupies part of a    
 gift and hardware store.              
 A butcher from a neighbouring village 
 makes two house calls weekly.         
 Wet fish is sold by a travelling      
 fishmonger weekly and at weekends a   
 van stops in the village to cook and  
 sell fried fish ands chips.
