		<content>very much.At 10.45a.m. we go out to    
play.We play Colours.It is a bit like  
Tig.After play we do Spelling          
Workshop,I hate that.At 11:30a.m.      
some people do recorders.I do that it

sandwiches.At about 12:30p.m. we go out
to play until 1:00p.m then we come     
in.We change our library books and     
then read for 25 minutes.If it is fine 
weather we go outside for games.It is  
winter, we are doing soccer.Our        
teacher, Mr Chivers, picks two         
captains.Today I am a captain.I have   
picked Chris,Mark,Richard and Danny.   
They are all good footballers.I pick   
three other people.Mr Chivers          
blows the whistle and we start.The     
other side has not got a very good     
team,so when we finish we are leading  
16-2.We go inside and get changed .    
Then Mr Chivers reads a story to us    </content>
