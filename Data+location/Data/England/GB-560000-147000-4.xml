		<content> HOP PICKING                           
 Our area used to be very famous for   
 hop picking but now it is not so      
 important.A place called the roundel  
 in an Oast House was used to dry all  
 the hops.They used to dry them with   
 coal but now they use oil.Families    
 from London came all the way just to  
 pick the hops but nowadays they are   
 picked by a team on a machine.        
 FRUIT PICKING                         
 Our area has always been famous for   
 fruit.Mr.Dolding our caretaker knows  
 all about our area.He can remember    
 when fruit was very cheap but now it  
 is much more expensive because it     
 costs more to produce.                
 HOUSES                                
 Mr.Dolding told us that a lot of old  
 cottages have disappeared and have    
 been replaced by flats.
