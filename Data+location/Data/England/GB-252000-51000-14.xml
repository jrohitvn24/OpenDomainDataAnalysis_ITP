		<content> In Brixton there are many large, old  
 houses like Brixton Lodge, Barnwell   
 House, Elbridge, Cloudsleigh and      
 Brixton House. One big house is now   
 Grahams Hotel and Restaurant. It was  
 built of granite in the colonial style
 in 1903 for the Moon family who owned 
 music shops in Plymouth. It has a     
 slate roof and a veranda, and four    
 false windows to avoid window tax. The
 house was once used as the vicarage.  
 Now it sleeps sixteen guests. The     
 garden is about an acre including a   
 tennis court. Mr.and Mrs.Lanning built
 their modern house between the hotel  
 and the old coach house. The one room,
 stone outbuilding is where the        
 gardener once lived.
