		<content>    We have five patrols and each one  
 has a leader. One night we had to     
 light a fire using only two matches   
 and then cook some pieces of spaghetti
 and tie them into a reef knot. It was 
 great fun, but I came home stinking of
 smoke! Another night one of the       
 Rangers (where girls can go after     
 Guides) showed us how to make fake    
 wounds. Some people had blisters made 
 by putting red wallpaper paste on your
 arm with some hot wax dripped on the  
 top. A few had gashes made with paste 
 and a bit of stocking with a hole in  
 the middle. I had a black eye because 
 no-one else would dare! It was made   
 with green, yellow and blue colouring 
 and took ages to get off. It was very 
 realistic. I really enjoy Guides.
