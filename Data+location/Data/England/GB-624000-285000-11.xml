 Some houses in the area date back to  
 the fourteeth and 15 C These are built
 from wooden frames with lathe and     
 plaster infilling. The smaller        
 cottages until the 18 C  were built   
 mainly of clay lump. Some brick       
 council houses built in 3 rows of four
 or six houses stand in large gardens  
 were many vegitables are grown for the
 family.
