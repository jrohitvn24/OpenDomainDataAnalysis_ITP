		<title>17ALICE STRUDWICK'S DAY,BRILL.</title>
		<content>On Saturday I get up at 7am..I go into 
the bathroom and wash with my flannel. 
Afterwards I go and get dressed and    
wear things like jeans and a jumper.I  
go downstairs and get my own break-    
-fast like a bowl of cereal such as    
Rice Crispies or Weetabix and buttered 
toast made in the toaster.Then I go and
clean my teeth with a toothbrush.After 
that i get ready to go to an iceskating
rink with Alice Gregory and her family.
We go to Oxford iceskating rink which  
is fairly new and quite cheap.When we  
come back I have lunch at home. Some-  
times we have people from the village  
to lunch so we have shepherds pie with 
vegetables and rhubarb for pudding.    
Then mummy washes the dishes and I dry 
them up.I go and play with Laura and we
roll down hills on the common.It is by 
now 4pm.so I go to choir practice at   
the church.At 5pm.I go home for tea.   </content>
