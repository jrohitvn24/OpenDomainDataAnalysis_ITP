		<content>I wake up in the morning about         
06.30,read then go downstairs and have 
a wash. I get dressed for school then I
go outside to feed my guinea pig and   
check my bicycle. After breakfast at   
08.05 I set off for a 0.8 km. journey  
to school. When I reach school I play  
badminton, tennis or football. At 09.05
it is assembly in the hall, then we    
have mathematics. Break is next when we
buy crisps from the tuck shop. At 10.55
we have English and if we do it very   
well and finish we have free choice    
time until 12.30 when we go to lunch. A
13.30 we start afternoon school, on    
Tuesdays we have football and art.     
After school we have either play       
practice, gymnastics or football club. 
I then set off for home and my tea at 1
.00. I usually go to bed at 20.30.
