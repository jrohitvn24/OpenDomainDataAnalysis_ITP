		<content> Mr.Scottsan makes furniture. His      
 favourite wood is mahogany which is   
 very good and strong for furniture    
 making. Mr.Centofanti does leather    
 work. Since leather is so supple lots 
 of things can be made from it such as 
 mats with plaited edges. Mrs.Hemming  
 and Mrs.Taylor carry on the craft of  
 tapestry which is illustrating        
 something on canvas by stitching in a 
 certain way. Mrs.Horley makes lots of 
 things from patchwork. Mrs.Claridge   
 does, or has done, a lot of crafts,   
 including toymaking, painting and     
 making night dress cases etc. She     
 raffles them for charity. Mrs.Atkins  
 makes lace. There are over 700        
 different kinds of lace making, but   
 Mrs.Atkins does bobbin lace. Mrs.     
 McCalloch has been an artist for      
 almost 50 years. Many crafts are still
 practised in Langton Green.           </content>
