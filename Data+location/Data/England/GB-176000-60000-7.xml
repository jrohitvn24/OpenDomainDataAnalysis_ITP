		<title>07LIVING IN PENTIRE</title>
		<content> We spoke to 2 people to find out what 
 a usual day was like.  One has lived  
 in this area for 2 years and likes it 
 a lot; she is a{Nanny}who looks after 
 the owner's children at the Hotel St. 
 Rumons.  She likes her job because it 
 involves children and it is permanent.
 At sometime she would like to work in 
 a Nursery with very young children.   
 In her spare time she helps a Girl    
 Guide Company.  She worries about the 
 amount of unemployment in Newquay at  
 present.  A second has been a{Hotel   
{Owner}for 19 years, been in the trade 
 for 30 years and still enjoys his     
 job. He rises at 6.00a.m. and at 6.45 
 he runs with his dog, swims at Porth  
 Joke then goes home for break-fast.   
 During the day he makes sure every-   
 thing runs smoothly. At 6.15pm the bar
 opens; from 7.00pm to 8.00pm dinner is
 served.  His day ends at 12.30a.m.    </content>
