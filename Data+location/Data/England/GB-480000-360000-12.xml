		<title>12Traffic in Collingham</title>
		<content> Part of the old section of Collingham 
 is the long and narrow High St.which  
 is also the Newark to Gainsborough Rd.
 Traffic coming from the area north of 
 Gainsborough often comes through      
 Collingham to avoid Lincoln.          
 For many years now the residents of   
 Collingham have protested about this,a
 recent 24 hour census having counted {
{800 heavies and 4000 lights.          
{Vibration}caused by this heavy traffic
 is beginning to damage buildings.The  
 noise is at times quite unbearable and
 the{exhaust fumes }are unpleasant.    
 Added to this is the narrowness of the
 road.{Safety }can be a problem,       
 particularly as some drivers are not  
 too concerned with driving slowly.    
 The quality of life has been affected 
 and the{proposed by-pass,}due within  
 the next 10 years will be all the more
 welcome for this.                     </content>
