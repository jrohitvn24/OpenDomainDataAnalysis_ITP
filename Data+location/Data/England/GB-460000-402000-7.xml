		<title>07PRIMARY SCHOOLS OF ARMTHORPE</title>
		<content> Tranmoor Junior and C of E Infants are
 two primary schools of Armthorpe.     
{NUMBERS OF PUPILS:}In both schools we 
 found the numbers had decreased       
 because of new schools and fewer      
 births.Therefore,they have had to cut 
 down on teachers.                     
{FINANCE:}The junior school with 168   
 pupils didn't get enough money for all
 the books and equipment needed,though 
 the infant school with only 36 pupils 
 had plenty of funds.It has used the   
 extra money for trips.The junior      
 school doesn't have many trips because
 of shortage of money and staff.       
{CURRICULUM:}In the 1st year of the    
 infants the children played many games
 and learned to read and write.Later   
 they'd learn to do simple sums.In the 
 early years of the junior school they 
 would concentrate mostly on Maths. and
 English.                              </content>
