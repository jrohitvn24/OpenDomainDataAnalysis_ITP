{May Green, the elder one, worked in   
{the Rose Hewitt Mill untill there was 
{a coal strike in 1921. The wages      
{weren't all that good.                
{   During World War 1, the two        
{sisters had worked by cleaning the    
{guns, etc.  At this time they were    
{paid more money. When I asked them    
{what is different now to then, they   
{replied that there has been a lot of  
{imporovement. In saying this they     
{remembered adout the death of their 14
{year old brother. He died of          
{rheumatism and heart disorders. So    
{obviusly, there has been a great      
{improvement in medicine.}             
                                       
    They didn't have much Entertainment
 when they were young.........
