		<content>    We followed a footpath through a   
 farm and found one field where the    
 grass had been planted and another    
 where it was natural. Here there was a
 mixture of grasses-up to ten different
 ones. The grass is used for grazing,  
 silage and hay and the fields were    
 surrounded by a mixture of hedges and 
 fences. The cattle we saw were        
 Friesian/Hereford crosses and were    
 being reared for beef. We think the   
 fields were bigger than they once were
 because of the large modern farm      
 machinery.
