		<content> There are 3 Anglican churches in the  
 area. The oldest is St Marys church at
 South Cowton. This is used by N &amp; S   
 Cowton residents in the summer. It is 
 a popular venue for weddings being in 
 an attractive country setting. During 
 the winter worshippers use St Lukes   
 church in the centre of North Cowton. 
 The Parish church in East Cowton is   
 All Saints, built at the beginning of 
 this century to replace a church half 
 way between N &amp; E Cowton. This church 
 now has a Sunday School. The Vicar for
 all three churches is the Rev. Philip 
 Rushton.                              
 All Methodists in the Cowtons worship 
 at North Cowton Chapel. It is part of 
 Darlington Methodist Circuit and the  
 Minister is Rev. John Mason. A Sunday 
 school has been held for 15 years. The
 Bible Fellowship meets weekly, and a  
 Crusader Club has just started.       </content>
