		<title>12MAINTAINING TAUNTON'S CANAL</title>
		<content>  In our block,the Bridgwater and      
 Taunton Canal is approximately 12     
 metres wide and is supposed to be     
 about 1.20 metres deep.However,       
 due to silting it is only half        
 this depth in places.                 
  A major problem is the heavy,summer  
 weed growth.While we were there the   
 huge,land based excavator was at work.
 It works on each stretch of the canal 
 twice a year.It removes the weed and  
 simply deposits it on the far edge of 
 the towpath.The heaps of dried weed   
 looked rather unpleasant and were     
 smothering some wild flowers.All year 
 round a British Waterways Board       
 employee works to keep the vegetation 
 on the banks under control.           
  In a three kilometre stretch of the  
 canal we only spotted a dozen pieces  
 of litter.It was all paper.
