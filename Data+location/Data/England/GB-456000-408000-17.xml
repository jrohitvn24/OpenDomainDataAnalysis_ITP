		<title>17A Bentley traveller's life</title>
		<content>  I live at{Tilts Farm, Tilts Lane,    
{Bentley.}Being a traveller is very    
 different to living like you people.  
 When you go to bed you don't have to  
 pull the seats out to make your bed   
 because yours is all ready made for   
 you. It is also different when we move
 around.You people can't move around   
 because you live in a house and I live
 in a caravan which has wheels.It is   
 also very different with money because
 a thousand pounds is not very dear to 
 us. In the old days travellers used to
 live in a wagon and they used to move 
 by tying a horse onto the wagon like  
 on the first photograph.We also used  
 to stop in the fields.We also say     
 different words to you,like you       
 say {"good"}we say{"cushty".          
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
