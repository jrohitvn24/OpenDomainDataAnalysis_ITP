		<content> Within the 12 km block lies only the  
 very small village of Kynnersley.It   
 seems the only way to create viable   
 groups for clubs and social activities
 is for the neighbouring parishes of   
 Preston,Eyton,Tibberton,Crudgington   
 and Horton to pool their resources.   
 Despite the sparse population there   
 are a variety of clubs and societies. 
 Kynnersley Village Hall,the venue for 
 many club meetings may be booked by   
 groups or individuals for a small fee 
 and is often used in conjunction with 
 villagers from Preston.Events held in 
 the hall include discos,whist         
 drives,jumble sales and barn dances.  
  A number of horses are kept in this  
 area,mainly as childrens pets for     
 riding, some of the children belong to
 the North Shropshire Pony Club.       
  There is no fox hunting in this area.
