		<content>  F.Robinson Ltd have been brewing beer
 at their Hillgate brewery for 150 yrs.
 Three of the founders relatives Peter,
 David and Dennis are now the present  
 owners. The Stockport brewery covers 5
 acres and employs 250 people.         
                                       
 It takes 2 weeks to brew high quality 
 beer. The ingredients used include    
 malt, hops, sugar, barley, wheat, oats
 and grist. From these materials they  
 make different varieties of beer. Some
 of them are Old Tom, lager, bitter and
 mild                                  
                                       
 Robinsons distribute their beer to    
 over 300 pubs throughout the North    
 West and North Wales using 50 barrel  
 tankers or lorries. They also own     
 shire horses which are used for       
 advertising their beers, mainly at    
 carnivals..                           </content>
