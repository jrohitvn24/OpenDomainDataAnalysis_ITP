		<content> FLOWERS.The early spring hedgerows are
 full of famous Cornish violets and    
 primroses.They are followed after     
 Easter by bluebells and campians in   
 the woods and by the roadside,        
 interspersed with cow parsley.There's 
 much gorse on the tops of the Cornish 
 stone hedges,and heather on granite   
 areas and moorland.Many wild fuchsia  
 hedges thrive in the warm coastal     
 climate. BIRDS.There are many water   
 birds near our coast,and a variety of 
 gulls which often fly inland. There   
 are wading birds around the Helford   
 River,and Herons and Moorhens are     
 sometimes seen in this district.In the
 moorland areas Buzzards are often     
 seen,and Pheasants abound in the      
 shooting season.Many Sparrows,        
 Thrushes,Blackbirds and species of    
 Tits and Finches visit the gardens,and
 Magpies are often seen in the school. </content>
