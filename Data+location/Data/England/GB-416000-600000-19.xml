		<title>19A day in Felton School.</title>
		<content> When we come to school we can play    
 outside.When the bell rings we come   
 inside and read quietly to            
 ourselves.Then we go into Assembley,we
 sing hymns and say prayers and have a 
 story.Then we do writing or dictionary
 or comprehension.After milk we go out 
 to play.After playtime we usually do  
 maths.Sometimes we watch a television 
 programme and we write and work on    
 what we have learnt from T.V.         
   After dinner we sometimes do some   
 work on magnets or weights.We make    
 working models like cars with         
 batteries .Some afternoons we do craft
 work and work on projects like Normans
 Sometimes we have netball or          
 football or rounders out in the yard  
 or on the field if it is dry.We have  
 P.E. or drama in the hall if we do not
 go outside.We went into the village to
 make maps when we made compasses.     </content>
