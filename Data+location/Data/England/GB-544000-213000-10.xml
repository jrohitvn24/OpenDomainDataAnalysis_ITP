		<title>10A DAY IN MY LIFE</title>
		<content>   I get up at 7:30 on week days I get 
 dressed, pack my school bag(lunch box,
 homework), have breakfast, I have a   
 cooked breakfast or cornflakes every  
 morning. By that time it is about     
 8:30, I go and get washed, get my     
 shoes on, wait for my mum to finish   
 doing her hair, then we go to school. 
 School starts at 9:00. During school  
 time we have assembly, first break,   
 lunch break, and hometime. After      
 school ends at 3:15 I go home,put my  
 play trousers on and go outside to    
 play. At 4:10 I come back inside to   
 watch television until 6:00. At 6:00  
 my dad comes home from working on the 
 farm. After tea I either go outside to
 play or watch television. Between     
 8:30 and 9:00 I go to bed but if I am 
 watching a good film I'm allowed to   
 stay up a bit later.
