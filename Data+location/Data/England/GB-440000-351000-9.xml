 1790.In 1840 they built houses,the    
 church and the school in Ironville for
 their workmen.The sort of things that 
 they make are Girders,Bridges,        
 Ore-Unloaders,Bunkers for loading     
 train wagons.We saw a film about a big
 Ore-Unloaders made by Butterley       
 Engineering.It was called{"The Gentle 
{Giant"}and was at Redcar in Yorkshire.
 It stood 71 metres high and unloaded  
 35 tons of ore from the ship each time
 the bucket was lowered.The Company    
 sells products all over the world.They
 sell Bridges in Botswana,Africa-      
 Bridges in India and Egypt and two    
 large machines in New Zealand.At the  
 present time.Then we had a film called
