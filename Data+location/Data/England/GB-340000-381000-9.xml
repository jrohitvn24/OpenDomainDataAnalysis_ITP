		<content>  Liverpool  Corporation  and  the  new
 improved  7,500 ft. runway  is capable
 of handling all types of aircraft.    
  From 1974,the airport has been run by
 the  Merseyside County Council.  It is
 fair  to  say  that Speke has suffered
 from the close proximity to Manchester
 International Airport,   but there are
 regular daily  flights to Heathrow and
 Gatwick,  Isle of Man and Ireland,  as
 well as  numerous  freight and charter
 flights,  including  the  nightly mail
 plane service,  which involves  planes
 going to fifteen  U.K. destinations as
 part of the  Post Offices  movement of
 mail.
