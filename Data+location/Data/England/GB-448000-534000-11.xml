		<title>11ANNE'S SHOP.</title>
		<content> Anne's Shop is 16 years old it is the 
 only shop in Clavering Estate and it  
 is not very big. I go on the way to   
 school every morning and every dinner 
 time.I always get a ripple bar and    
 some bubblies.They have more sweets   
 than all the meat and tins.The meat is
 under the counter and the beer is     
 behind the counter. The fruit and     
 vegtables are at the front of the shop
 they have a rack with the papers and  
 magazines on. They got new cupboards  
 in and put all their crisps under     
 there. They sell bread, teacakes,     
 creamcakes, cigarettes and ice        
 lollies. Every night some kids get    
 newspapers out of Anne's and deliver  
 them round the estate. At the end of  
 the week they get Â£3.50 for delivering
 them on nights and if they do mornings
 and nights they get Â£6.50.
