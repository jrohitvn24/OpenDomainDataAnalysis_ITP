		<title>15Memories of Witton-le-Wear</title>
		<content> There is a Memorial Window dedicated  
 to Miss Jopling in the North wall of  
 the church.The Rev.J.Hodgson and his  
 wife can be seen in the window to the 
 right of the Altar, with the old      
 Vicarage and the new Church in the    
 background.                           
   What was life like in Witton at that
 time? We had four general shops,also a
 butcher,a tailor,a baker,a joiner,a   
 cobbler,a fish-and-chip shop and a    
 blacksmith's forge.Wear Terrace had   
 it's own small shop.Work was provided 
 by two drift mines,sawmill, brickworks
 and a quarry.The Castle and Tower     
 estates also employed many people.    
   Although we had no buses,there was a
 good train service, and for many years
 Witton-le-Wear won the prize for the  
 best kept station:the flower beds were
 beautiful.
