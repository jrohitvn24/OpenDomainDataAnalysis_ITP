		<content>   Our Domesday area covers 12 square  
 kilometres of South Herefordshire,a   
 rural farming community,famous for    
 its rich red soil.The soil was hard   
 and crumbly because when we held it in
 our hands it would trickle through our
 fingers yet in the middle it was moist
 and sometimes you could squeeze it and
 it would be like clay.The stone was   
 mostly sandstone.We could tell that   
 because of the red colour and it was  
 crumbly,you could easily break it with
 your hands.                           
   "Jack-by-the-hedge"and cow parsley  
 were growing in the hedges.There were 
 also a lot of trees and holly bushes  
 growing in the hedges but apart from  
 blackberries there were not many wild 
 berries.We saw lots of birds'nests and
 snake and rabbit holes.The rabbits had
 made their holes at the end of the    
 fields where the hedges are.          </content>
