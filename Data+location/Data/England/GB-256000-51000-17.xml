		<title>17A day in my life - Part 1</title>
		<content>  by Mrs Peggy Apperly                 
                                       
 The sun shone through a gap in the    
 curtains and another day began. the   
 family was soon awake and I was the   
 centre of attention for a few minutes 
 opening my birthday cards and         
 presents.  I loved the home-made cards
 the children had secretly been        
 creating.                             
 Having seen my husband off to work    
 and the children off to school I      
 joined a friend for the short journey 
 to the local pick-your-own farm.We    
 spent a happy hour picking            
 strawberries for the school barn dance
 in the evening. The air was fresh and 
 clear and the fruit so very plentiful 
 and luscious. I could have stayed     
 there all day. The rest of the morning
 disappeared amid the routine jobs     
 about the house.                      </content>
