		<title>01THE NORTH BEDFORD AREA</title>
		<content> Since the 1960's the southern portion 
 of this area has undergone            
 considerable change.In particular new 
 housing estates have been built at    
 Brickhill and Woodside.All of this    
 residential area is quite flat.The    
 north of the area comprises mainly    
 agricultural land the villages of     
 Renhold and Ravensden and some        
 hamlets.This agricultural area is     
 gently undulating.                    
 As the area has developed it has been 
 carefully planned.Mowsbury Park is a  
 large recreational area  and houses   
 have been in the main built in        
 clusters with open areas of           
 grass,shrubs and trees giving a       
 feeling of 'openness' to the entire   
 development.                          
 Many of the following pages contain   
 data collected in a survey of 200     
 homes around Scott Lower School.      </content>
