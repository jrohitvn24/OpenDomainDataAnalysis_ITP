		<title>18PRINCES RISBOROUGH CARNIVAL</title>
		<content>The Carnival used to be a regular      
annual event in Princes Risborough,    
usually organised by the local round   
table. However in the late 1970's      
enthusiasm began to ware, and after a  
carnival in the Queen Silver Jubilee   
of 1977 there were no more. That is    
until saturday 8th june 1985. Once     
again the town got itself organised    
for it's Summer carnival, of course    
everyone hoped for good weather, the   
previous Saturday had been beautiful   
&amp; a repeat performance was required.   
The weather was fair,not good, but     
at least it did not rain. The          
procession consisited of 12 floats, the
band of a local boys brigade plus      
vintage cars and a group of majorettes.
The carnival Queen, a local 16 year    
schoolgirl rode in the precession and  
then judged the fancy dress            
competition, also there are aerobatics.</content>
