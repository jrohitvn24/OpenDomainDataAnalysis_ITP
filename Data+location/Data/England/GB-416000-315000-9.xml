		<content>Housing in Barton is varied.  There is 
a 1950's council estate, many Victorian
homes and a late 1960's private housing
estate.                                
In Wychnor the houses are mostly       
Victorian farm buildings and cottages, 
or are buildings connected with Wychnor
Hall in some way.                      
In Alrewas there are many fine half-   
timbered, thatched houses dating from  
as early as the 15th century.  These   
are on Main Street or close to it.     
Mixed in with these are some Victorian 
cottages, some 1930's detatched houses 
with big gardens and a 1970's private  
housing estate.  There are some brand  
new executive detached bungalows       
fronting onto the canal.  The vicarage 
is a 1960's modernistic house which    
does not blend well at all.
