		<title>14Interesting People Gorton 2</title>
		<content> The second person that I interviewed  
 had lived in Gorton for 70 years. The 
 biggest change that he notices is the 
 disappearance of the engineering      
 works.The memory of the past that     
 sticks most clearly in his mind was   
 the large number of workers leaving   
 Gorton Station early in the morning to
 go to work in the Gorton Tank Works.  
 He worked at B&amp;S Massey with over 600 
 others for 49 years. It does not exist
 any more.He feels that people's       
 attitudes have changed and that there 
 is now very little community spirit   
 compared with the past.Unemployment   
 has split up families and friendships 
 as people have been uprooted.Even so  
 he would not leave the area because he
 wanted to stay with his family and    
 grandchildren.                        
                                       
                                       </content>
