		<content> Much of the original furniture and    
 hangings remains at Houghton.KENT was 
 responsible for sets of furniture,    
 some in gesso and some in gilt and    
 walnut.Hundreds of yards of green silk
 velvet,made in Italy, were used to    
 cover furniture, and for the grand    
 STATE BED.Red GENOA velvet covers the 
 handsome suite in the MARBLE          
 PARLOUR,Robert Walpole's DINING       
 ROOM.In the SALOON ,red wool velvet   
 from UTRECHT is used on walls and     
 furniture. Throughout the house       
 ceilings are decorated with scenes    
 from classical legends.Walls in two   
 rooms are hung with BRUSSELS          
 tapestries,but the most outstading    
  are the MORTLAKE ones in the TAPESTRY
 DRESSING ROOM.These are woven from    
 pictures still in the ROYAL collection
 and are unique in that they represent 
 STUART kings and their family.        </content>
