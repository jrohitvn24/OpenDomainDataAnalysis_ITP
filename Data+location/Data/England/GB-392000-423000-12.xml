		<content>   Todmorden is linked to the outside  
 world by 3 main roads:the A646(T)runs 
 north-west to Burnley,9 miles away,and
 east to Halifax,12 miles away;the     
 A6033 runs south to Rochdale,9 miles  
 away and is joined by the A681 which  
 links Todmorden to Bacup, 6 miles to  
 the west.                             
   Todmorden has a railway station and 
 is on the main line from Manchester to
 Leeds.This line was temporarily closed
 in 1985, after a tanker train was     
 partially derailed in  Summit tunnel, 
 which is nearly 2 miles long.The fire,
 which lasted for several days, caused 
 a great deal of damage.               
   The Rochdale Canal, which flows     
 through the centre of Todmorden, joins
 the Bridgewater Canal at Rochdale and 
 the Calder and Hebble Navigation near 
 Halifax.It is hoped that in the future
 it can be reopened to attract tourism.</content>
