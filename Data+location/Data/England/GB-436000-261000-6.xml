  There are 13 farmhouses, two public  
houses with living accomodation and 100
other residences. 83 houses are in the 
village of Ufton (68 in 1969).13 are in
or near Bascote Heath. Recently a      
number of stone barns have been        
converted into houses and new detached 
properties have been built in three    
ex-farmyards. There are now 30 detached
houses in Ufton. 12 houses are of local
limestone. There is one row of brick   
semi-detached houses and another which 
includes old peoples bungalows. At     
Bascote Heath houses are mainly large  
detached and modern. Three have        
swimming pools.                        
  This housing pattern reflects the    
relatively recent influx of newcomers  
to the village.There are 15 more houses
than in 1969.
