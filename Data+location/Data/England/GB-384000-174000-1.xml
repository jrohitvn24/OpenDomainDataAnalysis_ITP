		<title>01THE COUNTRYSIDE SOUTH EAST</title>
		<content> The area is rural, predominantly      
 agricultural and woodland, and        
 includes                              
 the village of Yatton Keynell and     
 the hamlets of Ford, Slaughterford and
 Giddeahall. The farmland is mainly    
 enclosed rough grazing and the fairly 
 extensive woodland deciduous. The     
 Castle Combe Circuit is an important  
 Motor Racing venue. Apart from the    
 farming community residents leave the 
 area to work, in Bath, Chippenham or  
 Bristol, for the most part. A major   
 road the A20 crosses the southernmost 
 squares from east to west, one B road 
 crosses the grid area diagonally south
 east to north west, all other roads   
 being of minor country lane standard  
 for the most part. The western half of
 the block is included in the          
 controlled area of outstanding natural
 beauty.                               </content>
