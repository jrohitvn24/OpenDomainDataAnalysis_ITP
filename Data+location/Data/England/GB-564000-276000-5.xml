   MARKET GARDENING IS MY LIVING.I GROW
SOME VEGETABLES BUT MAINLY FLOWERS.MY  
FAVOURITE FLOWERS ARE CHRYSANTHEMUMS - 
WE GROW 32 VARIETIES - BUT SCABIOUS ARE
OUR MOST PROFITABLE LINE.              
   OUR BUSIEST TIMES ARE FROM JUNE TILL
SEPTEMBER WHEN OUR WORKING DAY CAN LAST
FROM 7.30a.m. TILL 9p.m. AT CHRISTMAS, 
WHEN THE CHRYSANTHEMUMS FINISH, WE HAVE
A HOLIDAY. THEN IN JANUARY WE BEGIN    
PLANTING SEEDS IN THE GREENHOUSES.     
   I SELL FLOWERS TO SOME LOCAL SHOPS  
BUT MOST OF OUR OUTPUT GOES TO COVENT  
GARDEN.EVERY EVENING OUR FLOWERS PACKED
IN BOXES ARE TAKEN BY LORRY TO LONDON. 
   MY WIFE AND I LOVE OUR JOB. WE MAKE 
A GOOD LIVING THOUGH WE WILL NEVER BE  
RICH.WE SOMETIMES HAVE PROBLEMS WITH   
PESTS, HIGH WINDS AND BAD BACKS BUT    
THOSE GO WITH THE JOB!
