 Three of us  went to see David Todd   
 the gamekeeper.We saw some three day  
 old pheasant chicks.He buys day old   
 chicks and rears them.The oldest in   
 the shed were three weeks old.Then he 
 puts them in strengthening off pens at
 four weeks old.At six to seven weeks  
 old, Mr Todd lets them out into the   
 release pens.After another four weeks 
 they fly out of the release pens into 
 the wild.We also saw a Black East     
 Indian duck with four ducklings.Then  
 Mr Todd took us to the incubator      
 shed.The eggs that are collected from 
 the company's own pheasants are       
 hatched in the incubator.He showed us 
 a bactericide called Nusan, with which
 he washes the eggs on collection.     </content>
