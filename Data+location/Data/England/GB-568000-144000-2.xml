		<title>02A DAY IN THE LIFE OF.......</title>
		<content>Margaret is a housewife in Collier St. 
"My day starts at 6.30.I get up and    
feed the 6 cats,prepare a breakfast of 
toast &amp; cereal and then get my 2       
daughters off to school and my husband 
to Marden for the 7.15 train to London.
I go to work at 9.30 until 12.00 at a  
local farm -apple picking and packing, 
looking after the stocks(young trees)  
etc.depending on the time of year.I    
then come home for lunch.Yesterday I   
helped transport some old people to a  
"Hunger Lunch" where you pay an amount 
and eat a very simple lunch-the money  
going to a special cause.After work in 
the afternoon,I prepared the evening   
meal,mowed the lawn and planted cabbage
plants.In the evening there was a      
church house group followed by a party 
in somebody's house where paintings    
were sold and framed.
