		<content> The farm milk is collected by Milk    
 Marketing Board tanker each day. At no
 time is the milk in contact with human
 hands. The feed is cattle provend from
 a 5 ton silo in the hayloft.          
   At right angles to the barn is a new
 shed, the winter holding quarters,    
 which will keep all the cows safe     
 during bad weather. The floor slopes  
 at one end to aid mucking out,which   
 uses large scrapers. A huge trough    
 holds enough silage for 2 to 3 days at
 a time. There is an attached small    
 building between this and the dairy   
 for calves. All bulls born are sold at
 market along with the weaker cows,    
 only the stronger calves replace older
 cows and keep the herd at its usual   
 level.                                
    Other barns and sheds hold the farm
 machinery which includes 4 tractors   
 and other implements.                 </content>
