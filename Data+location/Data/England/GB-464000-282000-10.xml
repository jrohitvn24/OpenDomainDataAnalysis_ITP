		<content> Most of the land round Husbands       
 Bosworth is farmland.{Mr Garner}farms 
 quite alot of it.He owns 250 acres and
 rents between 150  and 200 acres,from 
 Mr. Elliot who lives in the village,  
 Mr. Brown from Lubenham, Mr. Holyland 
 and Mr. Lawrence from Mowsley and Mr. 
 Maxwell who lives at Bosworth Hall.   
 He rents out one of his buildings as a
 pig-farm. 160 acres of his land is for
 crops and the rest (about 250 acres)  
 is for grazing. He owns about 150     
 dairy cows and about 60 followers     
 (young calves or heifers)and 280 ewes 
 and their lambs. Mr.Garner employs    
 about 5 people  but they aren't all   
 regular, some are on work experience. 
{Mr.Garner's family have been farming  
{in the village since about 1932}and   
 since then they have built it up to   
 what it is now.His father shared the  
 farm with Mr. Marsh.                  </content>
