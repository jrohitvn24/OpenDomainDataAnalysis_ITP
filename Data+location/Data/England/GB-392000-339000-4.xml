		<title>04GAMES PLAYED BY A GIRL OF 11</title>
		<content>The games I play at school in the      
winter are things like Netball or      
sometimes we just walk around the      
playground talking and getting hit by  
the football.In the summer we are      
allowed onto the field and we play Un, 
Deux, Trois.You play this by saying,   
"Un,Deux,Trois," and then you do a     
handstand.The one that stays up the    
longest is the next caller.In the      
winter at home we have snowball fights 
or try to see who can make the biggest 
Angel.In the summer we go out for      
bicycle rides and play on the swings   
at Grindley Park.At Grindley Park      
there are 2 big swings,2 baby swings,  
a roundabout and a slide.There is a    
bench where people can sit and the     
designers have provided a bin so that  
we can be tidy and litter conscious.
