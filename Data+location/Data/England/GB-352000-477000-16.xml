		<content> THE MILL IN OUR VILLAGE WAS ONCE A    
 COCONUT MATTING MILL.THE CHILDREN     
 WOULD START WHEN THEY WERE TEN.THEY   
 WOULD HAVE HALF A DAY WORKING AND HALF
 A DAY AT SCHOOL.ELDERLY PEOPLE HAD TO 
 WORK FROM SIX IN THE MORNING UNTIL SIX
 AT NIGHT.THEY HAD NINE DAYS OFF A YEAR
 THEY WORKED ON MACHINES WHICH WOVE    
 COCONUT FIBRE INTO COCONUT MATTING.   
 BEFORE THE MILL WAS A COCONUT MATTING 
 MILL IT WAS A SAW MILL AND MOST OF    
 THEIR WORKERS CAME FROM WAKEFIELD     
 PRISON.NOW THE MILL IS AN INDUSTRIAL  
 UNIT.WHEN THE WAR WAS ON THE WORKERS  
 GOT NINE SHILLINGS A WEEK.LATER       
 THE WAGES GRADUALLY GOT BETTER.IN     
 WORLD WAR TWO SOME MILLS HAD TO START 
 MAKING CAMOUFLAGED MATTING FOR THE    
 ARMY TO COVER UP GUNS, TANKS,AND      
 RUNWAYS.THEY MADE THE CAMOUFLAGED     
 MATTING BY DYEING THE YARN GREEN AND  
 BROWN THEN PUTTING IT ON HANKS.       </content>
