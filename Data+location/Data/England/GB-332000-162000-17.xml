		<title>17The old days in Worle</title>
		<content> We went to a lady who has lived in    
 Worle all her life. She told us some  
 information. Along Hill Road were lots
 of market gardens selling vegetables. 
 Also there used to be a railway track 
 along Station Road which is how it got
 its name. Worle was mostly bare       
 fields and small farms. Children      
 didn't have entertainment then. They  
 didn't have slides or swings. They    
 used to have to make up their own     
 games. In Worle at that time they     
 didn't have taps; they had pumps which
 were called the village pumps. The    
 pump in Worle was opposite the        
 Woodspring Pub.They had to get the    
 water from the pump and carry it back 
 in a yoke. There were also wells which
 were in peoples back gardens.The      
 milkman came twice a day seven days a 
 week.The lady said that she liked     
 the old days better than the modern.  </content>
