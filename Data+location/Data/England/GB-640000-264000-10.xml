		<content> Almost every house has a television   
 and radio and the use of a telephone. 
 The Ministry of Agriculture and       
 Fisheries has an information service  
 recorded for farmers. By ringing the  
 right Ipswich number he can get       
 detailed advice on the next moves he  
 should be making, whether it be       
 drilling, or fertislising or whatever.
 One cannot tell how many farmers use  
 it, but it is very detailed. The area 
 has one postal delivery per day ad 2  
 collections of post from Theberton.   
 East Green is near enough to Kelsale  
 to use the post office there which has
 the same number of collections.
