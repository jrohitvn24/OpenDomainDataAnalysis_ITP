		<content> The mainly agricultural landscape is  
 gently undulating with some large flat
 open spaces and very little woodland. 
 There is a total of 49 houses in the  
 village. 11 of these are thatched, on 
 timber frames with colour washed      
 plaster, 6 are 17th Century slate     
 roofed and the rest are a mixture of  
 Victorian red brick and modern i.e.   
 1960's and 1970's. 13 of the houses   
 are listed as Grade 2 Buildings by the
 Department of the Environment. Several
 of the thatched cottages have recently
 been re-thatched in combed wheat straw
 at a cost of approximately Â£4,000.    
 There are 2 Council bungalows dated   
 1947, one of which is now privately   
 owned.
