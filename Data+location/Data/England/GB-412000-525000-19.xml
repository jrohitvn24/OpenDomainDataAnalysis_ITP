		<title>19My Day</title>
		<content> I wake up at about 7 am &amp; read until  
 7:45.I get dressed and washed &amp; go    
 down to breakfast.After breakfast I   
 watch T.V. before going to school.I   
 always call at my nanas halfway to    
 school.When I get to school I play    
 with my friends.When the bell goes we 
 go into assembly in the hall.After we 
 come out we usually do maths or       
 English or a special topic.We have a  
 playtime at 10:35 and we play a game. 
 Playtime finishes at 10:55 &amp; we go    
 back into school.Sometimes we have a  
 telivision or radio programme.At      
 dinnertime I go home for dinner.I get 
 back to school at 12:35.After playtime
 which finishes at 1:15 we do work     
 again.There is another playtime at    
 2:30 and that finishes at about 2:55. 
 We go home at 3:55 then I have my tea 
 straight away.I usually watch TV for  
 an hour then I go out to play.        </content>
