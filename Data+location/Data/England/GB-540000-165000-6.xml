		<title>06CHATTERTON ROAD SHOPS</title>
		<content>    We found that most of the shops    
 that are in Chatterton Road do not    
 sell food.  Some of the older people  
 that we interviewed said that they did
 all their shopping here because you   
 can buy everything you need and it is 
 such a friendly place.                
    Some we interviewed said that they 
 found the shops a little more         
 expensive than in Bromley ad so they  
 did their main shopping at large      
 supermarkets nearby.                  
    In Chatterton Road there are four  
 takeaway food shops, a chemist and    
 Post Office in the same building and a
 supermarket.  There are several shops 
 which sell household goods and car    
 accessorioes.  There are quite a few  
 service shops such as an estate       
 agent, two hairdressers, dry cleaners,
 travel agents and hire shops.         
    The road is often very busy.       </content>
