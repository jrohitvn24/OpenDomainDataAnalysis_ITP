		<content>   Until 1980 the area had changed very
 little since the population increase  
 of the 1930's and 1940's. Elmdon Heath
 was developed with 3 bedroomed semi   
 detached homes. Up market properties  
 were built along part of the Hampton  
 Lane. The 1960's led to infilling of  
 housing on the Damson Wood area. The  
 greater part of the area changed very 
 little, with Catherine de Barnes      
 having a small settlement.            
  With the construction of the Damson  
 Parkway, on the edge of the present   
 Green Belt, in 1980, a great deal of  
 change is taking place. The land      
 adjacent to Hampton Coppice has been  
 developed. A large council estate     
 offering a mixture of semi detached,  
 maisonettes and old peoples           
 accommodation. The bulk of the land is
 being covered by large, detached,     
 luxury, private housing.              </content>
