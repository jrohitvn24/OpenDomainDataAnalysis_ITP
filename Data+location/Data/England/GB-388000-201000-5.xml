 There are several different types of  
 shop in our area.In the valley there  
 is a Post Office,and a shop which     
 sells childrens' clothes and prams.   
 There is also a barber's shop with a  
 red and  white pole outside.Each      
 of the four small villages which make 
 up our area has a Post Office.In      
 Chalford Hill there is a butcher,an   
 electrical supplier,a handyman store  
 a clothes shop,a hairdresser and a    
 take_away fish and chip shop.There are
 three general grocery stores.Both     
 Bussage and Oakridge have food shops. 
 The area really has very good shopping
 facilities.As long as people keep     
 using the village shops they will     
 survive,but if we go to the towns to  
 buy everything our village shops will 
 die.                                  </content>
