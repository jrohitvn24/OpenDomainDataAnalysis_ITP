		<title>18HAZEL SLADE SCHOOL</title>
		<content> {Hazel Slade School}is the only       
primary school in the village. It      
takes children aged from five to       
eleven years. The old building was     
built in the nineteen thirties when    
Hazel Slade was a mining village and   
it is made of wood. A new extension    
has been added recently adding a hall  
and four new classrooms,making eight   
permanent classrooms. There are also   
two temporary classrooms.              
  The school has eight teachers and    
two permanent helpers. Some parents    
help the teachers and children on a    
regular basis.The permanent helpers    
help with things like art which is very
interesting and assist in the tuition  
of musical instruments like the drums  
and recorders.                         
   It is a friendly school in a lovely 
setting{on the edge of Cannock Chase}.
