		<title>12A DAY IN THE LIFE OF MY DAD</title>
		<content> My Dad gets up at 6.30 in the morning 
 and he puts the radio  and  the kettle
 on. Then he makes two cups of tea, one
 for himself and one for my Mum. Then  
 he goes to the bathroom, has breakfast
 and goes to work at 7.45. My Dad is a 
 docker and the type of work he does is
 loading and unloading the containers  
 of cargo. The types of cargo are      
 Steel, Bags, Cartons and Timber.  At  
 12.00 he comes home for his dinner and
 at 1.00 he goes back to work until    
 4.30.  On his way home he goes for a  
 pint in the Reindeer pub. Then he gets
 home and cooks  tea, after which he   
 goes into the garage to make some     
 window and door frames. When he has   
 finished 1 or 2 he comes in and has a 
 bath and then at about 8.30 he goes   
 out to the pub.  He comes in at 11.00 
 has a coffee then he goes to bed.
