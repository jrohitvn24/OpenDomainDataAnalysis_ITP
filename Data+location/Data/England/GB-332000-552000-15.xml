 and situated in the centre of the     
 village, was built in 1958-9. The     
 money was raised by public            
 subscriptions and numerous efforts by 
 the villages. It has ample parking    
 space. The building is used for many  
 different things such as: whist       
 drives, concerts, film shows, plays,  
 dances, coffee evenings, wedding      
 receptions and funeral 'teas'. The
