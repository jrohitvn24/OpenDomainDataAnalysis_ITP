      Pewsey is a small market town on 
 the River Avon about seven miles      
 south-west of Marlborough. It has     
 agricultural and light industrial     
 employment and is on the main railway 
 line to Paddington, so many residents 
 are daily or weekly commuters.        
      The town is the main community   
 centre for the Vale of Pewsey, which  
 has been officially designated as "an 
 area of outstanding natural beauty".  
      The main educational, leisure,   
 social services and fire prevention   
 services and law courts for the Vale  
 are centred in Pewsey. The Kennet and 
 Avon Canal, which links Bristol with  
 London, flows close to the town       
 centre.  It is navigable by pleasure  
 craft.
