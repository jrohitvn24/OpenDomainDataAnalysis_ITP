		<content> The most popular leisure time activity
 is undoubtedly watching T.V. and      
 videos (for both adults and children).
 For adults this is followed by D.I.Y. 
 (jobs around the home) and gardening. 
 Teenagers also watch many hours of    
 T.V. a week. They form the biggest    
 group of people regularly visiting the
 pub for a drink. They also enjoy      
 dancing, chatting and drinking at     
 discos. These are often held at       
 Southam's Community Centre. Children's
 main interests are T.V., playing out  
 on bikes, sport, especially football  
 and swimming, roller skating, horse   
 riding and listening to pop music.    
 Many belong to the cubs, brownies etc.
 and enjoy the activities these offer. 
  There has been an increase in the    
 number of home computers and playing  
 computer games is very popular.
