		<title>10     THE DELL IN 1917</title>
		<content> This is a comparative account of the  
 area by a lady born in the Dell in    
 1917.  The word{"Dell"}means a little 
 valley shaded by trees.  That is what 
 the dell was in 1917.  Towards the    
 shore end there were big Victorian    
 houses stading in a garden on either  
 side. Two of these still remain,      
 converted into flats.  Later the lane 
 was built up with houses all the way  
 up to{New Chester Rd. }The{New Ferry} 
{pier}was just by our house where there
 is now an open grassed space to the   
 right of a little beach.  In the early
 twenties a ship crashed into the pier 
 in  the fog and it was destroyed.  I  
 was sad to see the fly-over  for the  
 by-pass over-shadowing the dell, but  
 pleased to see that our house, which  
 had been derelict for some time had   
 been replaced by new houses and green 
 areas had replaced the old pier.      </content>
