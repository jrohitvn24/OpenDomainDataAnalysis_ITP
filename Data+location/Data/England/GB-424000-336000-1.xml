		<content> Long Lane lies within a roughly       
 triangular area of rural countryside, 
 rising gently to the north and west,  
 bounded by Derby, Ashbourne and       
 Uttoxeter and aptly described as      
 "Derbyshire's Middle West.  Containing
 no focal point, this is a countryside 
 of scattered farms, small villages and
 hamlets, coppice plantations and      
 hedgerow trees with everywhere        
 intensive arable and pastoral         
 agriculture.  The steady decline in   
 population since the Middle Ages is   
 only partially arrested in selected   
 villages by limited residential       
 development this century.             
 Agricultural holdings have become     
 fewer but larger with the abandonment 
 of surplus farm buildings to other    
 uses or to dereliction. As in the rest
 of the British Isles, agricultural    
 output has soared in recent years.    </content>
