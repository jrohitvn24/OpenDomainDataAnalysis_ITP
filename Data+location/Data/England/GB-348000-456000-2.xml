		<content> the University of Lancaster is        
 built on a plateau which is half a    
 mile long. The buildings are arranged 
 from a long central spine and it is   
 possible to walk from one end to the  
 other under cover. This site was      
 chosen because of its natural shape,  
 good drainage and also because the    
 height of the area makes the buildings
 look more impressive. Bailrigg village
 was built in a valley to give shelter 
 and because it is near a spring line. 
 Until ten years ago the residents     
 drank pure spring water but now they  
 have a purifier in the system. The M6 
 motorway follows the lowest contour   
 with little artificial banking. The   
 main part of our block is grass       
 covered hills fising to around q80    
 metres which are used for grazing     
                                       
                                       </content>
