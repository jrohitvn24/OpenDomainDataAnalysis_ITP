		<content>  Bankhead comprises areas of farmland,
 residential, and a manufacturing      
 industrial sector.The products made   
 are pipes and paper.                  
  Waterton House is a large,old house  
 which has been converted into flats.A 
 railway line passes through this      
 area.There are only a few shops there.
 Bankhead has a sport's centre &amp; a few 
 outdoor sport's grounds,one hotel &amp; a 
 few B.&amp; B.'s. Most of the area was    
 probably built about 20 to 25 years   
 ago.                                  
  Near Bankhead is Grandhome.In one    
 of  the paper_mill's grounds is a     
 millpond.There is a story about it.It 
 goes like this:                       
  There was once a man who sailed      
 around the world.When he came back, he
 went to the millpond. He toppled in   
 and drowned. Now nobody is allowed    
 near the millpond.                    </content>
