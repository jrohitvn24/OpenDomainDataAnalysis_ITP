 Claybrooke Primary School is the only 
 school in the area which has its own  
 swimming pool which was built in 1961 
 by parents contributions, and         
 maintained by money raised by the     
 Parent Fund Raising Committee of the  
 school.The pool is covered by a large 
 plastic airdome which enables it to be
 used from May to October. The children
 have a lesson every day during term   
 time and are able to use the pool     
 every afternoon during the summer     
 holidays. A Parents/Begginers Club is 
 run every Mondays and Wednesdays from 
 3.30-5.00p.m.                         
  A Play Group is held in Claybrooke   
 Magna Village Hall on two mornings    
 every week during term time.
