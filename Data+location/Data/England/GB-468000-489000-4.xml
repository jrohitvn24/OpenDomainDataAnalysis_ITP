		<title>04Tourist Facilities in Hutton</title>
		<content> Hutton-le-Hole, being a holiday area, 
 tourism is second only to farming     
 in providing occupation. There are two
 souvenir shops, a snack-bar, two small
 hotels,a public house and five private
 houses offer bed and breakfast accomm-
 odation in this very small village.   
 Most of these are family concerns,    
 though about three other people are   
 employed. These catering establish-   
 ments provide an abundance of coffee, 
 teas and ice-cream,the latter seems to
 be the main attraction. Only the pub  
 provides lunches and dinners.         
 Hutton does not suffer much from      
 litter and most visitors respect the  
 country code, but there is some local 
 feeling against the commercialization 
 of the village.                       
 A large family house,owned by a Quaker
 foundation is used as a charity       
 holiday home.                         </content>
