		<title>05Mollington Village Community</title>
		<content> Mollingtons population is some 500    
 people,being a balanced community     
 of old locals,the older residents (20 
 years plus) and the new generation /  
 transients of 1or2 years.Most work in 
 Banbury or in the adjacent villages.A 
 few commute to London / Manchester a  
 increasing trend with the advent of   
 the M40 Motorway development.Several  
 U.S.A.F. men rent houses here whilst  
 on assignment to Upper Heyford Base.  
 The village primary school lies in the
 centre of the village and caters for  
 35 pupils age 5 to 11 from this and   
 some surrounding villages,whose own   
 schools have been closed for lack of  
 pupils and economic pressures.        
 Pupils leaving the school have an     
 option of going to either the Banbury 
 or Drayton Schools,both Comprehensives
 in the town centre and therefore a bus
 ride each day of five miles each way. </content>
