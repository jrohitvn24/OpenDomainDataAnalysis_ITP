		<title>17LONG DISTANCE WALKER.</title>
		<content>   Mr. Roger Frear, a teacher at       
 Blackfield First School, spent the    
 summer of 1985 on unpaid leave walking
 across Australia to raise money for   
 two local charities and his school.   
   The Australian people  proved       
 friendly and helpful, unlike some     
 Americans he had met across America   
 some years previous, when he had      
 needed to arm himself for protection. 
   In Australia, apart from the        
 continual problem of having to carry  
 his own water, the main difficulty    
 occurred when a badly infectrd foot   
 necessitated several days in a        
 hospital bed, unable to walk and      
 uncertain whether he would meet his   
 deadline of the new school term. He   
 made it and is now wondering what 1986
 might have in store.
