		<content>  Bellerby has little to offer in the  
 way of entertainment. The residents   
 either make their own or travel       
 further afield.                       
  In the village itself, the pub seems 
 to be a popular meeting place for     
 locals. The Memorial Hall has a       
 full-size snooker table, which is used
 regularly and young people use the    
 Parish field for games, mainly        
 football. Domino and Whist Drives are 
 also held in the Hall or at private   
 homes during the winter months.       
  Country and Western music is very    
 popular in the Dales and regular      
 'evenings' are held at the Rugby Club 
 in Leyburn and at the Falls Motel in  
 Aysgarth.                             
  Many nearby villages have cricket    
 and football teams,though not Bellerby
 itself. One local boy plays for Third 
 Division, Darlington.                 </content>
