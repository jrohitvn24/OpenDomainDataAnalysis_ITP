		<title>01INTRODUCTION  CALDERDALE</title>
		<content>    Old and new blend in this ancient  
 cloth-manufacturing area. The main    
 roads are all interlinked with old    
 steep lanes and tarmaced over cobbled 
 streets.                              
    The cloth trade made the area      
 prosperous.   The woollen mills got   
 their power from the fast flowing     
 rivers characteristic of this area,   
 with nearby canals and railways for   
 easy distribution.   Nowadays the     
 textile industry is not as dominant,  
 and the canals are mainly used for    
 leisure.                              
     New industries have built up      
 around the old ones and towns have    
 spread out to form better living      
 conditions.   Schools are mainly      
 comprehensive but with some grammar.  
     Calderdale is slowly changing from
 the satanic mill immage to a well     
 planned township.                     </content>
