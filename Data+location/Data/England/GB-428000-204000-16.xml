		<title>16RAF BRIZE NORTON BEGINNINGS</title>
		<content>   The airforce came to {Brize Norton} 
 in 1937 bringing the outside world to 
 a very quiet backwater of West        
 Oxfordshire.During the {Second World  
{War}it became the home of the {Heavy  
{Glider Planes}used in the invasion of 
{Europe}and at{Arnhem.}In 1950 the     
 station was loaned to the U.S. and was
 used as a base for U.S.A.F. bombers.  
 They extended the runway and cut off  
{Black Bourton}from{Carterton}and even 
 Carterton from its railway station.The
 RAF returned in 1965 and since then   
 the base has been the centre of the   
 RAF's world wide{transport fleet}. In 
 the 1980's the{VC_10's}travel         
 regularly to Hong Kong,Cyprus &amp;       
 Germany eastwards &amp; the U.S.A. and    
 Canada westwards. Two{Tristars}now    
 shuttle between Brize Norton and the  
 South Atlantic to maintain the        
 garrison in the Falklands.            </content>
