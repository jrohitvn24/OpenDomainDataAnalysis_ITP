		<title>19RETIREMENT IN BUDE</title>
		<content> There are many people living in the   
 area who have retired from work.The   
 largest concentration of retired      
 people is found on the {Moor Estate}on
 the edge of{Poughill}village.The      
 estate consists mainly of 2-bedroomed 
 bungalows,and although it is on the   
 edge of the village,it has fine views 
 of the coast southwards .Other retired
 people live in more remote and        
 isolated properties particularly at   
{Stibb.                                
  The people on the Moor Estate moved  
 to Bude from all over the country but 
 particularly from London and the      
 Midlands.Many moved because they      
 either had families or friends living 
 here, or because they wanted to enjoy 
 the peace and quiet.Some people enjoy 
 the milder winters and warmer summers.
