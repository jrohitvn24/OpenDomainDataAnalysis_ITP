		<title>12A FAMILY INDUSTRY</title>
		<content> My dad is called Roy. My dad and his  
 brother,who is called Roland          
 own this firm where they hire         
 out skips.They take a skip to a house 
 or an industry.The people fill it up  
 with rubbish or scrap,then we come and
 take the skip to empty it. Then       
 they go and empty it. A skip          
 is like a big box that goes on the    
 back of the lorry.At the yard we have 
 a yardsman who sells                  
 sand,gravel,cement,blocks and bricks. 
 Sometimes people want scrap so we use 
 a digger or a drote. A digger is a    
 machine with wheels and a bucket. A   
 drote is a machine that has got tracks
 and a bucket. To load cement,blocks   
 and bricks we use a fork-lift-truck a 
 fork-lift-truck is a machine with     
 forks on the front. And that is what  
 my dad does for R&amp;R Melland.
