		<content>{The first school}was built in 1939 at 
 Three Lane Ends.It was designed by    
 Oliver Hill and was ready to open in  
 1941.Mr.Hill was a lover of ships so  
 he designed the school curved so it   
 looked like a ship.He put 2 portholes 
 in the doors,a high one for adults to 
 look through and a low one for        
 children.A man called Mr.Taylor had   
 the idea of building this school.It   
 cost Â£26000 altogether to build.2     
 Londoners designed a pattern of horses
 and bison on the outer wall.It is the 
 only school of its kind.              
{Whitwood Terrace}was built in 1908 by 
 Henry Briggs &amp; Son for deputies and   
 undermanagers,surveyors,and clerical  
 workers at Whitwood Colliery.The      
 architect was Mr.Voycey.In the terrace
 there are 19 houses plus the institute
 which is now a public house.
