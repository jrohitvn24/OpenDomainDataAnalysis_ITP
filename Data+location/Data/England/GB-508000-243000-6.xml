		<title>06Cotton End Village Hall</title>
		<content> The village Hall was built in         
 approximately 1974 and has a seating  
 capacity for 120 persons. The Hall is 
 run by a committee and used by members
 of the community for a limited variety
 of activities.  On Monday evening it  
 is used for bingo.  On Tuesday evening
 there is a whist drive while on Friday
 evenings the youth club get together. 
 Cotton End senior citizens meet every 
 Wednesday afternoon for a happy hour. 
 The Hall may also be hired for use by 
 private parties for wedding           
 receptions, birthdays etc. Many       
 people would like to see a wider range
 of activities taking place in the Hall
 but too often any new venture fails   
 through lack of general support.  A   
 monthly village lottery, the 200 Club,
 is run by the village hall committee.
