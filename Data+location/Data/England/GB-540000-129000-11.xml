		<title>11LANDSC.  BUILD. CHELWOOD G.</title>
		<content> The underlying geology is beds of Ash-
 down  sand, of cretaceous age, very   
 inconstant in character, with sub-    
 ordinate seams of clay and silt and   
 capped by a thin but widespread pebble
 bed. Erosion of these beds has pro-   
 duced the stream vallyes which charac-
 terize the area. The mediaeval pale of
 the Royal hunting forest remains while
 cultivation has resulted in some rough
 grazing and fruit farming.            
 There are three significant mansions: 
 Birch Grove House, Wych Cross Place   
 and Chelwood Vachery. The oldest      
 building is Legges and Sedges Farm and
 there are two public houses and one   
 hotel.
