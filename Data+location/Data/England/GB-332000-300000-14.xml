Running through the area is a Bronze   
Age track leading to Stapley           
Hill.Hemford is a derivative of Yr Hen 
Fford -the old road.The area also has a
strong Roman connection as there are   
extensive lead mining dating back to   
those times, based on Roman            
Gravels.Pigs of lead bearing Hadrians  
name AD117-38 have been found nearby.  
The mining fortunes rose and fell.They 
rose in prominence in the 12 century   
and were at their peak in the 1880s.In 
1883 Roman Gravels produced 3,000 tons 
in one year.By the 1920s mining had    
virtually ceased,lead having latterly  
given way to zinc and barytes ore      
excavation.The lead mining history is  
reflected in the landscape, disused    
mineshafts and remains of mining       
buildings remain.
