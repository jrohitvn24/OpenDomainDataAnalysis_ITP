		<title>15The River Maun Landscape 1</title>
		<content>  Over seventy-five percent of the land
 cover is given over to cultivated     
 fields and either deciduous tree      
 cover, or coniferous plantations. It  
 is valuable agricultural land which   
 has a deep seated history. Records    
 show there was a farming manor at     
 Clipstone in 1086.                    
  Between 1817 and 1839 the floor of   
 the Maun Valley was levelled and a    
 unique flood dyke system was          
 established. Unfortunately mining     
 subsidence upset the levels and the   
 flood dykes are out of operation.     
  Efforts to restore the beauty of the 
 valley have involved moving hundreds  
 of tons of earth to landscape it. A   
 private campsite at one end of the    
 valley set amidst private parkland and
 lakes is an example of such ventures.
