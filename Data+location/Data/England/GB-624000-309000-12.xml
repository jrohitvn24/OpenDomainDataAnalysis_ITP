		<content> and pilgrims used to come to the      
 shrine of saint William_In_The_Wood.  
   The chapel stands in the centre of a
 large open space. One can see four    
 stone stumps set in a square. They    
 mark out an area of about 2 acres. No 
 vegetation grows on the site of the   
 chapel. People used to say that this  
 was because it was holy-land but the  
 fact is that the plants would not grow
 because of the flints. Beside the     
 chapel is the monks  burial ground.   
 This was found in the Second World War
 A bomb dropped on the corner of the   
 piece of land making a large dip. In  
 this were found the bones of some     
 people, presumably the monks, but at  
 any rate it was definately a burial   
 ground.Now it is a leisure area.      
   Mousehold takes up only 184 acres   
 now. The name Mousehold means "mouse  
 infested holt(Forest)".               </content>
