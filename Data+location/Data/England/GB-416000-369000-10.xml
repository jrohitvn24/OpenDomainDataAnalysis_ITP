		<content>{Thornbridge Hall }was built on land   
 once owned by the Longsdon family of  
 Great Longstone.                      
 A Mr. Marples had the House altered in
 the early 1900's, the grounds alone   
 costing Â£20,000 to lay out. A later   
 owner Mr. Boot was famous for his     
 collection of statues in the grounds. 
 In the second world war the building  
 was used as a School and later the    
 buildings were used as a Teacher      
 Training College.  In 1971 the        
 College merged with Totley College of 
 Education and in 1974 the site became 
 an Educational Field Study Centre for 
 the use of Sheffield Schools.         
 The buildings are now used as a       
 Conference Centre by Sheffield City   
 Council and the grounds remain        
 available to Sheffield Schools for    
 camping and field studies.
