		<content> Old People.  The old people are well  
 cared for in Longwick.  There is a    
 small close of bungalows for them     
 owned by the local authority, and a   
 private home has taken over the old   
 school.  A thriving over 60's club    
 meets in the village hall and also    
 organizes outings.                    
 Clubs.  Clubs existing in Longwick    
 include the Housewives Register,      
 W.I., Keep Fit, Mothers and Toddlers. 
                                       
 Longwick Sports Club.  Since l972 when
 the new playing field was opened,     
 Longwick has been able to run both    
 cricket and football teams.  Fund     
 raising activities, a garden fete, the
 harvest festival in the White Horse,  
 an annual dinner and dance help       
 support them and are much enjoyed by  
 the village.  It is hoped to          
 floodlight the field in winter soon.  </content>
