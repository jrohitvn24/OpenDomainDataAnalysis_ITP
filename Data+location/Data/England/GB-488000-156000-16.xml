		<content>   There is an Adventurer's Club for   
 the young children which is rather    
 like Sunday School, a Youth Club for  
 the older children and a Wives Club   
 for the mothers. Fathers sometimes go 
 on fun runs, shoot on the range or go 
 to the mess. Sometimes we can go and  
 play tennis, squash and badminton.    
   Blackdown School sometimes has a    
 fair that everyone can come to and    
 have tea, cakes and play some of      
 the games and buy things.             
   The Royal Army Ordnance Corps have a
 fun day and people can go and have    
 some fun playing the games and taking 
 part in activities like races.        
   The are two swing parks for us and a
 field for playing football. Girls of 7
 to 11 can go to the Brownies and girls
 of 11 to 16 can go to the Guides.
