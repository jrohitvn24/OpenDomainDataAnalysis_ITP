		<title>13THE CHILWELL GHOST</title>
		<content> Ghost House Lane in Chilwell has been 
 the site of a famous haunting.        
 In 1843, a local handyman and his     
 family living in a cottage called     
 Ashflat House, Chilwell, claimed that 
 he heard eerie bangings in the night. 
 Nothing was ever found but several    
 people witnessed the ghostly sounds.  
 The haunted house became so famous    
 that extra trains were put on to      
 convey people to Chilwell.            
 It was thought a Pedlar had been      
 murdered by Mr. X and his body        
 disposed of near the house. A         
 blood-stained axe was recovered from a
 nearby brook some years later.        
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
