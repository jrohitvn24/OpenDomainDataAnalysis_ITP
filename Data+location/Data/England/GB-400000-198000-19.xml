		<title>19SIDDINGTON'S CHURCH</title>
		<content> On the N edge of Siddington Village is
 St.Peter's Church.Parts of it are of  
 the Norman and Perpendicular styles   
 with Victorian additions. Between 1792
 and 1800 stained glass was taken      
 from St.Peter's to St.John's,         
 Cirencester and the return has been   
 discussed ever since. Each month there
 are 7 services including 2 Family     
 Services and the 6 bells are rung     
 every fortnight for Evensong. The     
 congregations average 55. Baptisms,on 
 the increase since 1980, weddings and 
 funerals are also carried out. Buriels
 are in the church's own grave yard. It
 is costly to maintain a small country 
 church. At the present money for roof 
 repairs is being raised by sponsored  
 events, fetes and concerts. The Vicar 
 is also Vicar of Preston, Chaplain to 
 the South Cerney Army camp and tutor  
 to local Lay Readers.                 </content>
