		<title>05TAPELEY PARK</title>
		<content> Tapeley Park was first opened to      
 the public in 1977. The house is      
 owned by Rosamund Christie and she has
 made it her lifes work to restore the 
 house. Miss Christie is a great lover 
 of nature and there are lots of       
 animals there today, like chickens,   
 geese, peacocks and rabbits. You can  
 also sometimes catch a glimpse of her 
 pet parrot called "Porgelot Pie".The  
 house has many ornaments and furniture
 inside. Tapeley Park attracts hundreds
 of holiday makers each year. In one   
 garden there is a large pool with fish
 and wild life in it. There has been a 
 house on the site since Doomsday, when
 it was held by the Bishop of Exeter.  
 The estate has about 6,000 acres,     
 which include Braunton Burrowes and   
 the beaches at Instow and Saunton.
