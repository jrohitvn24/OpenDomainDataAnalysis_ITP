		<title>10INDUSTRY IN NORTH SCARLE</title>
		<content>   Although North Scarle is only a     
 small village it has a lot of industry
 in it.There are three road transport  
 firms ,DFW'S,Porter's and Jones.Jones 
 are also agricultural engineers,and   
 wholesale butchers.                   
   There are two Daylay egg producing  
 sites,Russell Brothers,egg producers  
 and Swifts turkey farms .These all    
 have large sheds full of thousands of 
 chickens or turkeys.                  
   There are a number of gravel pits in
 the area ,and large lorries filled    
 with sand or gravel are a very common 
 sight.When they have taken all the    
 sand and gravel out of the ground they
 fill the lakes in and the land is used
 for farming again.We also have a      
 nurseyman in the village who grows    
 fruit bushes and flowers.In the spring
 the fields are full of daffodils.
