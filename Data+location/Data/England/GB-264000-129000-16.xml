		<content> Jim works as head groundsman at West  
 Buckland School.He lives in the       
 village less than a mile away.He has  
 been here for 4 months and came from  
 London.He came here because of the job
 and the work it involved.             
 In a normal working day he would cut  
 the cricket squares,clean the gym and 
 pavilion,cut and mark the athletics   
 track and make the front of the school
 look tidy.                            
 Compared to London the area is quieter
 and the behaviour of the children     
 better but it is much wetter.He misses
 his friends but thinks it will be     
 better for the family in N.Devon.     
 During his free time he enjoys playing
 cricket and going to Taunton to watch 
 his friend Ian Botham play cricket.
