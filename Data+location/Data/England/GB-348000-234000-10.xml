		<title>10Life Of Mr. Richards (cont.)</title>
		<content> has six children, four boys and two   
 girls, and ten grandchildren. It was  
 hard to bring up the children in those
 days because there was no family      
 allowance and no money from the       
 government.                           
  Mr. Richards had fifty acres of      
 Council farmland and it was an arable 
 and livestock farm. He has been living
 in the farmhouse for 49 years and when
 he retired in 1977 the Council took   
 his land from him. He didn't want to  
 retire because he enjoyed his work so 
 much, but he was ill.                 
  Nowadays Mr. Richards goes to town   
 once or twice a week and he enjoys    
 gardening. He also visits his sons and
 daughters. He says he's had a nice    
 life and would relive it if he had the
 chance.
