		<title>09BUILDINGS IN KING'S STANLEY</title>
		<content> The houses in the village are built   
 mainly of limestone but there are some
 brick houses.The oldest building,     
 apart from the church,is probably     
 Tudor Stores which is a timber frame  
 building with lath &amp; plaster          
 infilling.The new houses on the small 
 outlying estates are mainly of brick  
 although there is some use of         
 imitation limestone blocks.The school 
 was built in Victorian times though   
 some prefabricated classrooms have    
 been erected during the last 20 years.
 The Church is Norman,having a single  
 aisle on the South side of the nave   
 and a tower at the West end.Much      
 restoration was carried out in        
 Victorian times; the church was       
 completely rebuilt.
