		<title>17Spring Farm Vineyard.</title>
		<content> Wines and Vines:- There are 14 types  
 of{vine}grown, 12 white and 2 black   
 varieties. They are grown on a silty  
 clay loam overlaying blue lias, which 
 is a{limestone}rock formation with a  
 high calcium content. The depth of    
 soil varies from as little as 20-25cm 
 at the highest point to 1m in the     
 lowest growing area of the vineyard.  
 the vineyard is about 12 acres in     
 size, and lies 200-250 feet above sea 
 level.{Farming}grapes is difficult.   
  Some of the vines are grown on the   
 Guyot System, in which the{fruiting   
 canes are replaced each year, and the 
 vines are grown in a hedge. Others are
 grown on the Geneva Double Curtain    
 System, and the rest on the Open Lyre 
 System recently developed in Bordeaux.
  To protect the vines, windbreaks of  
 willow and poplar are used.
