		<content> Residents of this area are fairly well
 served by public transport buses. They
 could get one of the 14 services and  
 be on the coast at Brighton in 70m    
 monutes or in Eastbourne in 1 hr 35   
 mins. If they need an aeroplane for   
 holiday or business Gatwick, the      
 country's second international airport
 is 25 minuts away by bus. If they need
 to reach Heathrow, London's no 1      
 international airport Gatwick &amp;       
 Heathrow are linked by bus. Shopping  
 expedition to centres like Tunbridge  
 Wells, Croydon, Crawley or Haywards   
 Heath can all be reached by bus in    
 less than 1 1/2 hours.                
 Other bus routes will take residents  
 to Horsham, Reigate, Edenbridge,      
 Maidstone &amp; Gillingham(Kent) so car   
 less families should find it possible 
 to move around in a 30 mile radius    
 using public buses.                   </content>
