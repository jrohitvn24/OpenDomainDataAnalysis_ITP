		<title>07A Pupil at Gayton School</title>

"I like Gayton school because it is    
small and when you get stuck on your   
work the teacher has more time to      
explain. We are very lucky because we  
have an outdoor swimming pool and when 
it is warm enough we swim three times  
a week. We have two classrooms and we  
do P.E. in the middle of the main room.
We do most of our work in the big room.
The big ones work at one end and the   
rest work at the other. When the other 
teacher comes in we use the little     
room. Our secretary works in the big   
room too. The playgroup uses the       
school house in the  morning and they  
come into our school to do P.E. and    
have stories with us. We eat our packed
lunch there as well because we don't   
have proper school meals. The infants  
go home at 3 o'clock and the juniors go
half an hour later".                   </content>
