		<title>18Mum's Schooldays In Wendover</title>
		<content>                                       
My mum's childhood in the early 1950's 
was not like mine because her parents  
were very strict. On Saturday morning  
she went with friends to the children's
cinema in Aylesbury, but today I watch 
T.V at home. My mum went to church     
three times on Sunday but does not     
expect me to.                          
 The games she played were similar to  
my own, marbles, skipping, conkers, 5  
stones, hopscotch and leapfrog. She    
also had fun roller-skating up the     
High Street and went on long cycle     
rides. Traffic prevents that kind of   
activity today.                        
 Mum's pocket money was 2/6d (12p) but 
mine is 1 pound. When she was 10 years 
old, Mum was crowned May Queen - the   
last one the village had. What a pity  
many of these customs have disappeared.
