		<title>09WATER SUPPLY IN NEWTON</title>
		<content> Piped{water}didn't arrive in Newton   
 until the 1940's. Before then the     
 villagers relied upon two pits.The{Tea
{Pit}contained water for human         
 consumption, and the{Horse Pit}was for
 all other purposes.At the first pit,  
 the people had to get a stick and stir
 the green scum off it before they     
 could carry it away in buckets.Some   
 farmers, like Mr. Shippey had a water 
 cart for their farm cottages.The      
 school was supplied by two big water  
 tanks.Sometimes the teachers          
 complained of rusty,red water! Every  
 source of water had to be used.When   
 the jam strawberries were sent away in
 wooden barrels for instance,the       
 barrels were soaked in the dykes first
 to make them watertight.The pits were 
 filled in when piped water eventually 
 arrived.
