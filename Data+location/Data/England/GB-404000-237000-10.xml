		<title>10LIFE IN CHILDSWICKHAM, 1985</title>
		<content> Childswickham, a market gardening     
 village, situated where the Cotswolds 
 meet the Vale of Evesham, has changed 
 considerably over the years. Houses   
 have replaced small orchards. With the
 demise of small holdings and the      
 growth in mechanised farming, most    
 workers commute daily to the towns.   
 Several smallholdings and two market  
 gardening families still produce fruit
 and vegetables. Loss of a post office,
 shop and school, together with        
 increased price of properties has     
 resulted in changes to village life.  
 Life revolves around the Church,      
 Village Hall and Public House. The    
 Women's Institute, Wives Group and    
 Evergreens for the elderly, meet in   
 the Village Hall where Bingo, Whist   
 Drives, Bridge and Snooker are also   
 played. A baby clinic and mobile      
 library are also provided.            </content>
