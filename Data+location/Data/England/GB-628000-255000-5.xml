		<content>We asked children to find out why their
parents did the jobs. Lizzie's mum     
works at Mr. Hollands farm and she     
likes it because it is in the open air 
and her friends work their. Kirsty's   
mum works at the Angel pub in          
Woodbridge. She works very late        
sometimes but she likes it because she 
always comes out happy. Her dad works  
at White House Farm, Dallinghoo. He is 
the Farm Manager and looks after all   
the animals. He leaves at 7.30a.m. and 
returns at 4.30p.m. He likes it because
he comes bouncing down the road with a 
smile on his face every day.           
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
