		<content>In the World today people have more    
games than anything. We play Football, 
Cricket and Rounders. Some of us have  
Star Wars toys and some of us have     
board games. We play board games like  
Cluedo, Monopoly, Game of life and     
Chess. You play Cluedo like this. There
are 5 suspects and you are one of them 
except one person. You sort out the    
cards into piles one for suspects one  
for implements and one for rooms. one  
person picks a card from each pile     
puts it in the black envolope but must 
not look at it. You put your suspect on
a square that is the same colour as    
your suspect. You must move into rooms 
and make accusations. You must take it 
in turns to move. The idea of the game 
is to guess the murderer and the       
implement and room in which he\she     
commited the crime.          ANDREW
