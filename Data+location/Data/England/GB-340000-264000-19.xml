		<title>19LEISURE TIME IN AYMESTREY</title>
		<content>  Most of the outdoor activities of the
 people of the area are self contained,
 walking, gardening, cycling, riding   
 angling, shooting; with reading, TV,  
 music, knitting and embroidery the    
 usual sedentary ones. The farmers of  
 the area aver they have no leisure    
 time, the odd hours in the pub playing
 darts and quoits and discussing their 
 plight is part of the job!            
  Less widespread but illustrating the 
 variety of people are: choral singing,
 golf, old-time dancing, car rallying, 
 morris dancing, dog breeding, skating 
 and re-enacting Civil War Battles.    
 Facilities for all these being found  
 somewhere in the neighbourhood.       
  Mixed craft classes are held in the  
 Village Hall when instruction is given
 in a variety of crafts, furniture     
 restoring being popular. Swimming is  
 catered for in Leominster &amp; Ludlow.   </content>
