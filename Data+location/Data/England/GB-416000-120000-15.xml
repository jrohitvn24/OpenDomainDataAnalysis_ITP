 leaving for Dorset. He would like to  
 create more space in the church and   
 would like to use it for a variety of 
 different events. He said that he

 Many people in our Class like watching
 television. We have many favourite    
 programmes. We like watching 'The     
 Young Ones' because it is funny and   
 there are a few rude parts in it.     
 Other popular programmes are          
 'Dynasty,' 'Dallas,' and ''Allo,      
 'Allo,' a comedy series about the     
 Second World War. 'Dallas' is a       
 serial about 2 Texan families who own 
 big oil companies, the Barnes family  
 and the Ewings. These two families    
 never agree about anything.           </content>
