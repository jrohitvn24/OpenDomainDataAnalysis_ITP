		<title>15Day in Life of a Post Man</title>
		<content> Mr N is a{postman.}He starts work at  
 7.20 am at the{post office}in{Bolton  
{Abbey}to sort the letters into order. 
 Next he starts{delivering letters,    
 postcards, parcels, bills, magazines, 
 adverts. There are about 500 letters a
 week, more at{Christmas,}to 50 houses.
 They come from all over the world.    
 Every body gets letters some times.   
 People like getting letters but not   
 bills. He stops to talk because       
 that is one of the pleasures of the   
 job. After work he mows the cricket   
 pitch and he has lots of{hobbies      
 especially stamp collecting. He has   
 been late because of bad weather in   
 winter. There is another postman who  
 delivers in Bolton Abbey and          
 Beamsley. Delivering letters runs in  
 the family, father 60 years, mother 27
 years, Mr N 17 years.
