		<title>01OUR VILLAGE</title>
		<content> Our part of the Domesday Project      
 involves us surveying an area which is
 mainly open countryside but which also
 contains a number of small villages.  
 These villages are Staple Cross,      
 Hockworthy,Burlescombe,Westleigh and  
 the village where our school is which 
 is called Holcombe Rogus.In addition  
 there are a number of scattered tiny  
 communities which are based on farms, 
 some of which are rather isolated.    
 However we do not feel that we live   
 "in the wilds" and we like living here
 very much.I think that we know every  
 body who lives in the area and many of
 us are related in some way although   
 quite a lot of new people have moved  
 into the village in recent years.     
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
