There is a wide range of housing in our
area. In the villages much of the      
housing is of the local ironstone and  
some of the houses in Great Dodington  
still have thatched roofs. The housing 
on the Kingsway Estate was built by the
Local Authority. Some of these houses  
have been sold to their tenants who    
have made improvements to them adding  
rooms, replacing windows and fences    
and building garages. Some of the      
houses now becoming shabby and show    
signs of neglect by their occupants and
the Local Authority. There is evidence 
of vandalism in some of the shared     
areas especially in the shopping area  
which is in the centre of the estate.  
The prices of housing range from about 
25 000 for a small semi to 85 000 for a
detached house in Great Doddington.
