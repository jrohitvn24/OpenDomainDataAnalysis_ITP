		<content>   Cozens farm is situated to the east 
 of High Ongar village on the north of 
 the main Epping to Chelmsford road.   
   When the present owners took over   
 the farm forty years ago,it was a     
 mixed arable,pasture and animal farm. 
 The work was done by four men,two     
 horses,a cart,one tractor,plough and  
 cutter.The 183 acre farm noe has dairy
 and beef cattle and the fields are    
 used for pasture and hay crops.It is  
 highly mechanised and worked by the   
 owners and one other man.The milk is  
 sold to a dairy at Chadwell Heath in  
 litres and the farm has a strict quota
 that they may produce.Over that       
 amount,they are fined 17\p per litre. 
 The young cattle are sold if not being
 kept for the dairy herd.The milking   
 parlour is of a heringbone design and 
 the milk is collected by a tanker each
 morning.                              </content>
