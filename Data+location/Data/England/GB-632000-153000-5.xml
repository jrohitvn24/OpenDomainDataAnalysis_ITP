		<title>05HACKLINGE AREA FARMING</title>
		<content> Farmland covers most of the area.     
 Market garden crops as well as wheat  
 and barley are grown and there is some
 fruit.                                
 Cattle and sheep graze the grassland  
 whlch is also cut for silage and hay. 
 Bullocks also graze on the marshland  
 at Hacklinge. Twelve farms work land, 
 the largest consists of a group of    
 five, Betteshanger Farms, belonging to
 Lord Northbourne.                     
 There is one plant nursery which runs 
 an expanding import-export business in
 cut flowers and pot plants, also      
 pottery from Holland which is sent by 
 lorry all over Britain. Marley Farm   
 Nurseries also specialize in conifers 
 which are sold at the nursery.        
 In spite of the tendency towards      
 larger fields many hedgerows remain.
