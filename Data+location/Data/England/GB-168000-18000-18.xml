		<title>18PUBLIC BUS SERVICE</title>
		<content> We asked 5 local people what they     
 thought about public transport in the 
 area. All agreed that the bus service 
 was too expensive, left at            
 inconvenient times, and was not       
 frequent enough.An old lady said that 
 she found it difficult to reach       
 railways, hospitals and libraries and 
 that there was no bus service from    
 Predannack, where many old people     
 live, into Mullion. A disabled woman  
 said that there is no consideration   
 for old or disabled people: there are 
 no small buses operating over small   
 distances for such people's           
 convenience.{Actual bus times:}Helston
 _Mullion _ The Lizard (Mon,Tues,Thurs,
 Sat).Depart Helston 13.25,17.15 arrive
 Mullion 13.54,17.44. The Lizard _
