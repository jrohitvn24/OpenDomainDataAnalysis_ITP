		<content> This rural area which lies between 90 
 and 100 metres above sea level is     
 largely covered by corn crops.Most    
 farmers grow these for sale or as     
 cattle feed.Within the area there are 
 many different herds of cattle.We have
 seen shorthorn,limousin and cross bred
 beef herds.The cattle graze freely on 
 the grasslands but during some of the 
 growing season areas of grass are     
 fertilised and growth is encouraged   
 for use as silage and hay.Through the 
 area runs the main A423 which carries 
 heavy traffic between Coventry and    
 Southam.Along this road lies the      
 village of Marton which has become a  
 dormitary residential area for the    
 surrounding towns.
