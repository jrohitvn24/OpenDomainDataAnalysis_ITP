		<title>14ISOLATION IN THE SAMPFORDS</title>
		<content> This area is very isolated.  There is 
 very little evidence of good roads but
 there are several smaller roads and   
 footpaths.  The better roads lead to  
 the neighbouring villages of          
 Radwinter, Finchingfield, Little      
 Bardfield and Wimbish.  One road leads
 to the small town of Thaxted.         
 The small roads all lead to the farms 
 or farmhouses which have been         
 converted into private dwellings.  The
 footpaths too are across farmland and 
 link the farms.  In the area that once
 was a airfield, there is no evidence  
 at all of roads or footpaths.         
 Therefore the inhabitants are very    
 isolated.  Some form of transport is  
 needed in order to reach the main part
 of the village where the many         
 activities are taking place.  The     
 children have to be brought to school 
 by mini_bus or in private cars.       </content>
