		<title>08ABBOTSHOLME SCHOOL</title>
		<content> The Headmaster is Mr.D.Farrant who has
 been at Abbotsholme for 12 months. The
 school day starts at 8-50 am.with     
 Chapel. The Chapel itself has a marble
 statue of the 'Radiant lover' along   
 one wall.The school day finishes at   
 6-40pm. and assignments begin after   
 supper. One tradition that has        
 survived from the days of Reddie,is   
 the position of 'Redship'.This is a   
 coveted title awarded to 5th formers  
 in the school,whose behaviour and     
 attitude are worthy of note.This      
 usually leads to Prefectship being    
 awarded in the 6th form.'Reds' are    
 elected by Staff and Prefects through 
 discussion,although the final decision
 rests with the Headmaster.Only 10 or  
 so 'Reds' will be selected. Prefects  
 are elected by Staff,6th formers and  
 'Reds'.
