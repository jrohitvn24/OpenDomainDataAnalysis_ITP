		<content> because my brother is on the trailer  
 stacking the bales.I also like helping
 my dad when we are doing lambing.Some-
 times my dad lets me take thelamb off,
 And I also hold the sheep when my     
 brother isn't there, when my dad takes
 the lamb off.Sometimes I check my     
 dad's sheep for him.I also like       
 helping my dad when he feeds his      
 cattle.

 My hobby is fungi collecting.Every    
 Autumn my dad,sister and I go fungi   
 collecting.We collect about 10        
 different species of edible fungi.    
 Sometimes we just fry them in butter  
 or else we dry them and use them in   
 winter for soups,stews and other      
 recipies.In our family I am the only  
 one who does'nt like mushrooms.You    
 might think I am scared of being      
 poisoned, but I always try new species</content>
