   This block is situated upon a       
 peninsula bordered by Southampton     
 Water and the river Hamble.           
 It consists of a combination of       
 modern council estate,Victorian       
 villages,open farmland and inland     
 water.                                
   Employment is mainly allied to      
 shipbuilding but there are many self  
 employed chiefly in the building      
 trade.                                
   The block is divided almost equally 
 by the borough boundary Southampton   
 and Eastleigh.                        
   Much of the recreational activity   
 centres upon the excellent sailing    
 facilities.                           
   The area boasts an ancient ruined   
 monastery at Netley and a castle      
 rebuilt in the 19th. century on the   
 site of an earlier fortification.     </content>
