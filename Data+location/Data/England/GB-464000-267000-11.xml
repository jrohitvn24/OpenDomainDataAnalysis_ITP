		<title>11HOUSING IN EAST HADDON</title>
		<content>The last 20 years has seen the building
of a number of modern houses in the    
grounds of larger old houses. This has 
also led to the building of several    
small cul de sacs. Most of this housing
has been of the executive type and has 
served to emphasize the differences    
between the true village folk and the  
commuters. As the sewers of the village
are now at full capacity all future    
development has to be severely limited.
                                       
On numerous occasions recently plans   
have been put forward for secondary    
developments in back gardens etc.. To  
date these have all been turned down.  
                                       
Of long term concern however must be   
the absence of large quantities of     
housing at the lower end of the market 
to attract young families to the       
village and maintain the school.       </content>
