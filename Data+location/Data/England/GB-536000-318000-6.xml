		<title>06A DAY IN SUTTON ST JAMES</title>
		<content> On a Monday my dad gets up early      
 because he has to go to work in       
 Wisbech.He is the manager of a nursery
 for the handicapped, and at work he   
 shows and tells people how to set     
 plants in the polytunnels and         
 glasshouses. I get up at eight, and   
 prepare for school. At ten to nine,   
 Barry and I get in the car, and we    
 collect some other children on the    
 way.Mum by this time will be in the   
 greenhouse seeing to the flowers. We  
 take a packed lunch to school.        
  After tea I have to get ready for    
 Cubs, where we play lots of games.    
 When I return, my brother goes to bed,
 and I tell Mum about my day. I help   
 her a little with the plants. My mum  
 calls my brother a tell-tale because  
 he is always telling them.            
                                       
                                       </content>
