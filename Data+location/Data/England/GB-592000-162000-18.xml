		<title>18THE A2 ROAD</title>
		<content>    The A2 road was a main route from  
 Dover to London before the M2 motorway
 was built. Although the amount of     
 traffic that uses the A2 is less, on  
 busy days the road is used by at least
 1000 vehicles of all types per hour.  
 Bapchild village was originally built 
 on each side of this old Roman road   
 but building development has taken    
 place on the south west side. This    
 development consists of a small number
 of Council owned properties and a     
 larger private estate. When road works
 are being carried out on the approach 
 to Sittingbourne the road through     
 Bapchild is often filled with traffic 
 waiting to enter the town.
