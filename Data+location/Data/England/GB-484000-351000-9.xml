		<content> Approximately 80 households.          
 190 people on the  electoral roll (+68
 children ).                           
 Approximately   25%   retired  people,
 remainder fairly  well  spread  across
 the  age range from  young families to
 pre-retirement  age  group. Among  the
 older people many are Beckingham  born
 or have lived  in  Beckingham  a  long
 time. Three-quarters of the population
 have moved into the village during the
 last 15 years ___ again across the age
 range.                                
  In about 30% of the families both the
 husband  and  wife  work  outside  the
 village  which leads to  most families
 having at least one  car and  probably
 as  many  as  35%  of  the  households
 having  more  than  one  car.         
 Public  transport  is  a  limited  bus
 service   at  times   which   do   not
 encourage  its  use.                  </content>
