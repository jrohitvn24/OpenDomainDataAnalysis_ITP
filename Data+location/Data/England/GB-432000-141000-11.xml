		<content>     Andover Garden Centre takes up a  
 large corner site at the end of       
 Salisbury Road.                       
     It has been open for trading for  
 nearly ten years. It has a large range
 of items for sale including plants,   
 trees, gardening equipment, paving    
 slabs, fencing, greenhouses and       
 sheds. Inside some of the             
 greenhouses the air temperature is    
 kept warm and humid for potplants etc.
     A new service that the Garden     
 Centre offers is one of landscaping   
 work. They plan and plant your garden 
 for you.                              
     The Garden Centre is open every   
 day of the week and is particularly   
 busy at the weekends.
