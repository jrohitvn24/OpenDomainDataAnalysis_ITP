		<content> A linear village which grew up along  
 what is now the A692 road.            
  Stone built farm houses and cottages 
 can still be found on the lanes       
 leading to Gateshead and Whickham, the
 village centre is the result of the   
 growth of mining in the l9th. century.
  Behind the main street with its two  
 rows of shops are red brick terraces. 
 The track bed of the Tanfield wagonway
 (built l725) and now a country walk is
 the main reminder of mining.          
  Between the wars numbers of larger   
 houses appeared at either end of the  
 village but the village's present size
 is the result of council housing on   
 land to the north extending towards   
 Whickham. Most houses are 'link       
 villas'. Many are now privately owned.
 Although basically a commuter village 
 Sunniside has three garden centres.
