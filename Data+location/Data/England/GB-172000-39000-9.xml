		<content> My group studied{United Downs.}We     
 found that there was not one          
 amenity there.The whole of the area   
 is covered with abandoned tin and     
 copper mine workings. Up to about 100 
 years ago there were many mines       
 working there. Today there are several
 ruined engine houses there. Two have  
 been renovated. In Cornish an old     
 engine house is called a{"knacked     
{bal".}                                
 Tregarlands farmhouse used to be a    
 public house called The Miners Arms.  
 Today some of{United Downs}has been   
 planted with trees and another part   
 has been cleared for small factories  
 to be built.
