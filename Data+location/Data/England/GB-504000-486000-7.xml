		<title>07Guest Houses</title>
		<content> There are a great many guest houses in
 Scarborough. People on holiday stay   
 for bed, breakfast and evening meal.  
 It costs Â£7 to Â£9 per person per day. 
 The landlady gets up at about 6.00 in 
 the morning and has to make the       
 breakfast and get everything into the 
 hot cupboards. Then the bell rings for
 breakfast at about 9.00. The landlady 
 will circulate and talk to the        
 visitors. The guests then go out for  
 the day, making their own arrangements
 for lunch. Meanwhile the landlady     
 washes up and makes the beds. She may 
 go to the cash and carry for more     
 food. In the afernoon she prepares the
 evening meal for the visitor's return 
 at 5.30. Afterwards they may go out   
 again to the amusements or theatre    
 returning at 10.30 for a light supper.
 The tired landlady will still chat to 
 them before retiring exhausted to bed.</content>
