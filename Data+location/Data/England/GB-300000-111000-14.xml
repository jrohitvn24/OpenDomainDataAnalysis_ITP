 three miles away from Halberton.They  
 go there because there isn't another  
 school in Halberton village.They start
 at Halberton first school when they   
 are five years old and finish in their
 ninth year.                           
 In the school the children haven't got
 a canteen so they have a set meal.    
 In Halberton School they haven't got a
 video or a computer or a proper room  
 for a library but they have got some  
 books to use.They hire a video from   
 somebody.They occasionally have a     
 barbecue and a fete all in one.They   
 have an exhibition when they do good  
 work on a project.When it is ready    
 they ask parents to come and look     
 around.
