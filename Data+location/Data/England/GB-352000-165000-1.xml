{farming.}It is quite hilly.  There are
 three main villages{Felton,Winford}and
{Dundry.}We are in Winford.There are   
 schools and Churches in all three     
 villages ,and Shops and Post Offices  
 in Winford and Felton.Near Winford    
 there's Winford Hospital,and in all   
 three villages there are Pubs.There   
 are also three quite small reservoirs 
 with water works beside them.There are
 quite a few springs in the area.There 
 are{three disused quarries}in the area
 but there is another one which is     
 working,and also{two disused pits,}and
 so there are quite a lot of old       
{disused mine shafts.
