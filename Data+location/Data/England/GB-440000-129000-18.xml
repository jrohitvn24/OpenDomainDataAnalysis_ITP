		<content>  I have to dress in style for school,I
 wear a shirt,shorts and blue socks.If 
 I had my own way I would wear jeans   
 and a denim jacket.At weekends I like 
 to wear jeans,a T-shirt and trainers. 
  The games I play are cricket         
 and tennis.I belong to Littleton      
 Tennis club.Tennis is my main         
 interest.I also play the piano for    
 fun and I have brass lessons.         
  My favourite pop group is Kool and   
 the Gang because I like their music.I 
 enjoy watching televison, especially  
 Hunter,The A-Team,and Street Hawk.    
  I enjoy going to fetes,concerts and  
 shows.I like drinking Coca Cola and   
 lemonade and my favourite food is
