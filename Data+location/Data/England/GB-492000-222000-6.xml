		<content>  This two foot gauge railway is a true
 working line, built in 1919 to carry  
 sand from the quarries to the main    
 line of the London and North Western  
 Railways. Apart from its opening day  
 the railway had never provided a      
 passenger service until 1967 when a   
 group of enthusiasts formed a society 
 to save the line from extinction and  
 to open it to the public for the first
 time. Since then they have rebuilt    
 the track, built their own coaches,   
 station and engine sheds, installed   
 signalling and safety equipment and   
 acquired several unique and historic  
 locomotives. The line passes through  
 varied surroundings from its terminus 
 at Pages Park, past on of many sand   
 quarries in the area, through new     
 housing estates and industrial areas  
 to open country side. The return trip,
 five and a half miles, takes 70 mins. </content>
