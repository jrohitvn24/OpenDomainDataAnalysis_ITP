 north bank of the River Severn.It is  
 strung out along the one road that    
 runs from the Coalport bridge to the  
 Lee Dingle around the bottom of Blists
 Hill.The village started as homes for 
 the workers at the china works but now
 most of the houses are recent having  
 been built in the last twenty five    
 years.The china works is now a museum.
    There is only one small shop in the
 village ,selling sweets,drinks,and    
 fishing goods ,and three pubs;the     
 Shakespeare and the Brewery Inn while 
 over the War Memorial foot bridge     
 is the Boat Inn.                      
    The post office closed recently and
 there is only one postbox and one     
 telephone box.There is one factory    
 -the Nuway Manufacturing Company-who  
 use old rubber tyres to make door     
 mats.                                 </content>
