		<title>19PROBATION HOSTEL,WINDYRIDGE</title>
		<content> There has been a large house at       
 Windyridge since the 17th century,but 
 its more recent owners have included  
 Captain Kelso,whose widow sold it to  
 East Andlian Regiment who used it as  
 an officer rehabilitation centreduring
 the war.It was purchased by the       
 Whitechapel Mission in 1954 and in    
 1955 it was opened by the Duke of     
 Edinburgh as a probation hostel.The   
 house now stands in 25 acres of land, 
 but it is believed that at one time   
 the whole valley was owned by one     
 family.Much of the land is taken up   
 with a farm which consists of goats,  
 pigs and a small flock of sheep.Some  
 hens and ducks provide free range     
 eggs.A variety of vegetables and fruit
 are grown for the consumption of the  
 residents of Windyridge.
