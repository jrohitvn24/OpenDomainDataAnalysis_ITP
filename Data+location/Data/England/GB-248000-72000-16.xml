		<title>16Elderly People in Tavistock</title>
		<content>    A lot of old people live in        
 Tavistock.Some have lived in Tavistock
 all their lives and some come here    
 when they retire because it is        
 peaceful and near the Moors.Most old  
 people live in their own homes or with
 their families, but some live in      
{ residential homes}or old people's    
{ flats}so that they can be looked     
 after.                                
    There are 8 private residential    
 homes in Tavistock looking after about
 100 old people.There is one large     
 council-owned home called{Harewood}   
{House,}accommodating 57 people.       
    There is also a{Day Centre}where   
 old people go for a cup of tea and to 
 meet their friends.                   
    The old people we talked with in   
 Tavistock were happy; the residential 
 homes are warm and cosy, and have a   
 good atmosphere.                      </content>
