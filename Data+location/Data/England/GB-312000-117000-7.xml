		<title>07The Wellington By-pass</title>
		<content>   Due to the pressure on the town     
 centre from traffic the Wellington    
 Relief Road was constructed to the    
 south of the town. It was opened in   
 May 1971 at a cost of Â£200,000.The    
 route of this road largely follows the
 route of the early A38 which possibly 
 diverged from its present route at    
 Hockholler,running to Pyles Thorne,   
 Webbers Grave and Bagley.             
   A traffic survey was taken on this  
 road at the same time as the one taken
 on the M5.During the fifeteen minute  
 period only 3 holiday vehicles were   
 spotted.Mainly the type of user tends 
 to be either local inhabitants        
 travelling around Wellington or going 
 into Taunton, and Transport lorries   
 working locally.                      
   Since the building of the Motorway  
 this area has become much quieter.
