		<content>    A railway was needed to transport  
 the iron from the hills to the        
 river.Houses were needed for the      
 dockers and miners to live in, and    
 shops to provide them with clothes and
 food.                                 
    Steel works were built near to     
 Middlesbrough so that the iron ore    
 could be turned to steel before it was
 shipped to other parts of the country.
 This meant more, people, more houses  
 and more shops.                       
    The centre of Middlesbrough used to
 be on the Northern side of the railway
 line near to the river, and the first 
 town hall can still be seen today.The 
 centre of town moved almost one mile  
 to the South when a much bigger town  
 hall was built half a century later.  
    The town is now a major centre for 
 refining North sea oil, as well as    
 having Europes biggest chemical plant.</content>
