		<title>06Traditions of Hungerford.</title>
		<content>   Residents of 99 houses in the       
 High Street in Hungerford are known as
 commoners and have commoners          
 rights.From these 2 Tutti men are     
 selected and it is their duty on Tutti
 day to tour commoners' houses carrying
 the tutti pole which is decorated with
 flowers.At each residence oranges are 
 exchanged for a drink and a kiss from 
 the lady of the house.                
   The custom originates from the      
 tything men who had to collect fines  
 from commoners who had not attended   
 court.The pole was a nose gay because 
 some of the houses smelled badly.     
   Another high office is that of      
 Constable who presides over the       
 Hocktide Court where changes are made 
 in Commoners rights.Hungerford still  
 boasts an official ale taster and a   
 town crier so the old traditions look 
 set to continue for many years to come</content>
