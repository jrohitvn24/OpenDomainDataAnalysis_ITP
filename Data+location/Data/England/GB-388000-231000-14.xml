		<title>14A DAY IN MY LIFE</title>
		<content>  My day commences at 9,cleaning the   
 surgery.First patient at 10,then one  
 every 15mins until 5-30.              
  For a dental inspection I chart their
 dental records,then a National Health 
 form is signed by the patient which is
 sent to Eastbourne so that the dentist
 can be paid.Some patients are nervous,
 I chat and put them at their ease.    
  When a filling is needed I hand the  
 dentist instruments,mix lining of zinc
 oxide and oil of cloves,prepare       
 filling mixing silver with mercury to 
 make amalgam which I hand to the      
 dentist in an amalgam gun.After each  
 patient I put clean mouthwash,        
 sterilise the instruments.            
  When crowns and dentures are needed I
 mix all impressions,take wax bites,and
 consult patients as to shade of teeth.
 All work to be sent to labs I write   
 job cards and take to the Post Office.</content>
