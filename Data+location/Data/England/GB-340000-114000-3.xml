 Someone is 'on it' and he counts to 40
 at a post.Everyone else runs away and 
 hides.If the person who is 'on it'    
 sees someone then he can run and touch
 the post and says{'40-40 seen'}and    
 then the name of the person he saw.If 
 the person he saw beats the person who
 is 'on it' to the post then he can say
{'40-40 home'.}A person can run for the
 post and get home even if he hasn't   
 been seen.If a person who is the last 
 to be seen can reach the post before  
 the person who is 'on it' he says{    
{'40-40 save all'}which means the      
 person who is 'on it' is on it        
 again.Otherwise the person who was    
 seen first has to be 'on it' for the  
 next game.
