		<content> Before the farm was titled  Highfield 
 House it was known as Leigh Farm.Mr.  
 Sharp(the farmer)rents 131.5 ha(325   
 acres)for his crops of sugar beet,    
 wheat, barley,oats,peas, potatoes and 
 grass for hay.The rotation period of  
 the fields is 4-5 years,this is the   
 way the fields are worked:-barley,one 
 year,sugar beet the next year,barley  
 for another year,peas the next year,  
 then wheat,after that the process     
 starts again.The farmer owns 1 combine
 harvester.If the weather is good Mr.  
 Sharp gets-up at 4.00a.m.,but usually 
 he gets-up about 7.00a.m.He does not  
 need to get-up early to feed his      
 animals because he does not have any. 
 At harvest he employs boys over 13 to 
 drive his 2 tractors.his soil varies  
 brtween rich and stony.He owns a big  
 fertilizer,and hand-sprayers for weed 
 killer,an elevator &amp; a beet harvester.</content>
