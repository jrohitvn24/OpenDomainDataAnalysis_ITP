		<content>   There are fifty-four houses in      
 Saxton that are older than four years.
 A house is what we live in and it is a
 sort of shelter from the rain and the 
 wind.In the houses there is furniture 
 and in all houses a television.       
 Upstairs there are some beds.         
                                       
   Some people have a garden and grow  
 their own vegetables. In some houses  
 there are some pets like a dog.       
                                       
   A house is usually made of stone or 
 brick. Some times you can find a house
 made of wood. We have four wooden     
 Swedish houses in Saxton. In a  house 
 you will find some glass windows to   
 look out of. In the house there is a  
 fire so in winter it will keep people 
 warm.
