		<content>     Like its near neighbour Holt Heath
 this was once part of a much larger   
 heath.This site to has been under     
 pressure from other land users.       
     Although it is common land very   
 few people recently have used the     
 grazing rights.As well as it's        
 interest as a habitat it also contains
 a number of ancient remains,most      
 dating back to the Bronze Age.In the  
 early 1980's despite protests a local 
 farmer fenced off part of the common  
 and ploughed it up with help of a     
 grant to put in improved pasture      
 land.The site remains fenced off but  
 the improvements to it have been      
 abandoned and the land has quickly    
 gone back to scrub.Other parts of this
 heath have been turned over to        
 scramblind and BMX courses.Other      
 sections are used for rough grazing.  
 This site has a very varied use!    . </content>
