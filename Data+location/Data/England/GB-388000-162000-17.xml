		<content>   Years ago before they had a pool,   
 everyone learned to swim in a tyre    
 tied to a long rope.  Jacko Webb      
 taught them in the River Avon down at 
 the Halfpenny Bridge by the Avon      
 Rubber Company.  They used to hold    
 swimming galas with all the pretty    
 lights, flags and decorations.  This  
 was before they altered the run of the
 river.  It is called Halfpenny Bridge 
 because fyou had to pay a toll of one 
 half pence.                           
   Today people swim at the Blue Pool, 
 which is an open air pool.  The pool  
 is open from the first of June until  
 the first of September.  It has 3     
 diving boards at different levels.    
 There is a paddling pool for young    
 children.  There is talk of building a
 fun pool with slides, islands and jets
 of water.                             
                                       </content>
