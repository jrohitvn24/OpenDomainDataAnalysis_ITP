		<content> I think{Southwell}is a lovely town. It
 is in a convenient setting.{Newark,   
{Mansfield}and{Nottingham}aren't too   
 far away.Also you can go to{Sherwood  
{Forest,Rufford}or{Clumber Park}without
 too long a drive. The shops are       
 convenient too.We have a Co-op, a     
 sweet shop and plenty of good clothes 
 shops. We have several newsagents, a  
 cobblers and a shoeshop. There are two
 Infant Schools, a Junior School and a 
 Senior School.{The Leisure Centre}is  
 good. There is a swimming pool, a big 
 hall and a bar. We have ten pubs in   
{Southwell. They}are{The Wheatsheaf,   
{The Crown, The Reindeer, The Rodney,  
{The Hearty Goodfellow, The Bramley    
{Apple, The White Lion, The Saracen's  
{Head}(also a hotel),{The Admiral      
{Nelson}and The{Newcastle Arms.}The    
{Minster}is our town's main attraction.
 It is a very old church.              </content>
