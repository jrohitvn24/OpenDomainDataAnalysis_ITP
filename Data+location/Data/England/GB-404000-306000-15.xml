		<title>15PETS AND ANIMALS.</title>
		<content>     Animals and pets play a large part
in peoples lives in Chasetown. A       
majority of people keep pets and the   
most popular pet was a dog. The most   
popular breed of dog was a collie and  
female animals seemed to be favoured,  
perhaps because people think they are  
better behaved. Many people say they   
keep pets for company and protection.  
     On animals in general there were a
variety of other types of pets but     
there was a view against keeping exotic
pets, such as snakes.                  
     Many people think that dogs should
be closely controlled more than they   
are now. A majority of people asked    
were in favour of higher licence fees. 
     Most people thought it cruel to   
use animals in scientific experiments  
but saw a value if it was to help cure 
disease, but not for the sake of       
vanity.                                </content>
