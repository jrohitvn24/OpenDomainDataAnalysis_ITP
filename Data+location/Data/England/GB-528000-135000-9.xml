 School.                               
  On Saturday the 22nd.June 1985 I     
 awoke quite early because like every  
 other saturday morning I was going Ten
 Pin Bowling. I sat up in my bed and   
 looked out of the window,it was a dull
 overcast day more like November.The   
 garden looked damp and miserable. The 
 rain of the past few days had spoiled 
 the flower and tree blossom,          
 everything was a different shade of   
 green. After my Breakfst I walked from
 my home in Forge Road into Crawley.   
 Most of the houses are identical as   
 they are all council houses, but I    
 could see that some people had new    
 windows and doors which meant that    
 they had bought their houses like my  
 family had.As i approached the Bowling
 Alley I could see its bright yellow   
 door and luminous sign saying"bowling"</content>
