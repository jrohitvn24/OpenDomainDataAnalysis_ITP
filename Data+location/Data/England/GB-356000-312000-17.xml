		<title>17THE OLDEST INHABITANT</title>
		<content> MRS. PARTON IS OVER 90.  SHE HAS LIVED
 IN RODINGTON FOR 55 YEARS.  SHE STILL 
 ENJOYS LIVING HERE ALTHOUGH THE       
 VILLAGE HAS GROWN A LOT. THERE WERE   
 MOSTLY SMALL COTTAGES WITH THE PEOPLE 
 LIVING IN THEM WORKING ON THE LAND.   
 THERE WERE NO COUNCIL HOUSES, MOST OF 
 THE SMALL COTTAGES BELONGED TO THE    
 ESTATE. EVERYBODY USED TO KNOW EVERY- 
 BODY ELSE, BUT NOW NEW HOUSES HAVE    
 BEEN BUILT AND SHE DOESNT KNOW SO MANY
 PEOPLE. NOT SO MANY WORK ON THE LAND  
 NOW. THERE IS ONE PRIVATE HOUSE WHERE 
 6 SMALL-HOLDINGS USED TO BE. MACHINERY
 HAS TAKEN OVER. THE LOCAL FARMER USED 
 TO EMPLOY 21 MEN BUT NOW ONLY 4. VERY 
 FEW OF THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN THE     
 VILLAGE ACTUALLY WORK THERE. MRS.     
 PARTON CAN REMEMBER WHEN THERE WAS A  
 BLACKSMITH, WHEELWRIGHT,UNDERTAKER AND
 BAKER.THE CHILDREN USED TO BRING ROUND
 THE BUNS, HOT FROM THE OVEN,AT EASTER.</content>
