		<title>03The Wild Area at Dinnington</title>
		<content> Many schools are making Nature Areas  
 in their school grounds, but there has
 been a {Wild Area}at{Dinnington}since 
 1973. It began with a campaign called 
 "Plant a tree for 73" and has         
 developed since then. Now the trees   
 are well established, wild flowers,   
 spring flowers, shrubs and grasses    
 grow there. In 1985 the{Wild Area}is  
 being extended, a marshy area and     
 boulders for moss is planned. On      
 Thursday 2nd May,1985 200 trees were  
 planted to begin the extension.       
 Mr.Creedy and the{COUNTRYSIDE         
{MANAGEMENT SERVICE}brought the trees  
 and helped in planting by digging the 
 holes.    Every child in the school   
 planted a tree.{THE COUNTRYSIDE       
{MANAGEMENT SERVICE} encourage and help
 people to conserve and improve their  
 own environment. Ash, oak, blackthorn,
 hazel and hawthorn were planted.      </content>
