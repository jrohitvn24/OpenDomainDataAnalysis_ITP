		<content>Mr Ray,the director of the Technical   
Planning Department of the East        
Northants County Council told us about 
the pedestrianisation of Rushden High  
Street.This is going to take about nine
years to finish.The first phase will   
cost about thirty thousand pounds and  
will be finished by Christmas.The pe-  
destrianisation will make the environ- 
ment pleasanter for the shoppers with- 
out worrying about being knocked over. 
At first shopkeepers objected to it    
because they thought they would lose   
business.                              
The County Council are also planning to
build a cycle pass connecting Grangeway
and Wymington Road. This is to prevent 
cyclists from using the busy Manor Road
and particularly help children who are 
cycling to Wymington Riding Stables.
