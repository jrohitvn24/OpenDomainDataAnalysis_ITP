{continued.}                           
 Part 2 At School.                     
 When she gets to school she starts to 
 make the school dinner. In the        
 afternoon, after she has served the   
 dinner, she does the washing up with  
 her friends. (The other dinner        
 ladies.)                              
 She then goes home and does some more 
 odd jobs around the house. Later on   
 she goes back to school to clean it.  
 In the evening she helps her husband  
 and her daughter works with her also. 
 She gets about 6 to 8 hours sleep and 
 gets up at about 10 to 8 in the       
 morning.                              
 Mrs. Bennett has worked as a cook for 
 25 years by this September. She never 
 wants to move from Lydd Green, because
 she hates busy towns.
