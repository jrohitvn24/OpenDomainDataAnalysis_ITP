 the village.You have to be over 60    
 years of age before you can join.They 
 meet twice a month on the first and   
 third Thursdays.They meet in the      
 village hall.Sometimes they go out on 
 a coach trip to visit a beauty spot or
 another over 60s club.People come     
 to the  meetings to entertain them or 
 tell them things.At Christmas  they   
 have a Christmas Dinner and sing      
 carols and sometimes they go to see a 
 pantomime in Plymouth.Some of the club
 go together on a summer holiday.There 
 are a lot of people who go to this    
 club because a lot of old people live 
 in Grampound.They do a lot of talking.
