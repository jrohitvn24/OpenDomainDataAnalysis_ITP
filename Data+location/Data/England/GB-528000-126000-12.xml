		<content> The road which carried the London to  
 Brighton stagecoach ran through the   
 territory on the B 2114. This was used
 until the A 23 was constucted in 1813.
 A service was started in 1766 and it  
 took all day to travel in a leisurely 
 fashion from London to Brighton.      
 Tollgates  in the area were thrown    
 open in 1866.                         
      Pilstye Farm dates originally    
 from about 1647 with a third story    
 added in the 19th century, but it     
 appears that the suffix " Stye" here  
 and others in the area originate from 
 the Scandinavian god TIW. Spicers Farm
 is a 15th century timber framed       
 building, the roof partly Horsham     
 slabs and partly clay tiles. Nearby   
 is the White House originally late    
 16th century, but so enlarged and     
 restored it is now more modern than   
 old.                                  </content>
