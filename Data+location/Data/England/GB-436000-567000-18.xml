		<title>18THE ROMANS IN SOUTH SHIELDS</title>
		<content>{Arbeia}was built as a fort with many  
 granaries  to supply the garrison on  
 nearby{Hadrian's Wall}. Its site was  
 easily defended, being on a hill      
 overlooking the river,with the sea to 
 the east and marshes to the south.    
                                       
 Excavations began in the 19th century 
 and the most recent have uncovered the
{West Gateway.}There are plans to      
 reconstruct this and some ramparts.   
 The small{Museum}contains artefacts   
 found on the site, showing how the    
 Romans lived. We know that at one time
 the fort was occupied by cavalry, and 
 burials and cremations occurred. Other
 finds include jewellery and remains of
 food including dormice, quails,       
 oysters and wild boar.                
 Clearance of poorer Victorian housing 
 has helped archaeologists extend the  
 dig and more finds are hoped for.     </content>
