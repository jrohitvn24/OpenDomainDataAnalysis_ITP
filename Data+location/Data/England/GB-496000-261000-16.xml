		<title>16VILLAGE HALL</title>
		<content> The former Souldrop{village school}was
 taken over as the village hall in     
 1971, the children in the village now 
 going to Sharnbrook or Riseley for    
 their schooling.  The hall belongs to 
 North Bedfordshire Council and is     
 looked after by the Parish Hall       
 Committee, the{trustees}being the     
 parish council.                       
                                       
 The front of the building carries the 
{village clock,}given to the village   
 in 1911 by Sir Albert Bowen of        
 Colworth Hall. The clock is of        
 traditional construction driven by    
 falling weights and is intended to run
 for a week without rewinding. The     
 weight well has now been filled in    
 so it currently runs for only 2\-days 
 before rewinding. The village{post    
{office}is located at the side of the  
 hall.                                 </content>
