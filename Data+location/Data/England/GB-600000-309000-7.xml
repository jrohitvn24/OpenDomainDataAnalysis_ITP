 community headed by an Amenites       
 Committee raised enough money         
 to buy a playing-field near the       
 church.Katie Glass from Anglia        
 Televison opened the village playing- 
 field known as Jubilee park in        
 1980.Among the recreational equipment 
 is a climbing frame,and a see-saw. At 
 the entrance to the Park are a fine   
 pair of wrought iron gates with the   
 name "Jubilee Park" written on them.  
  Events held in the village include a 
 carnival,jumble sale,car treasure     
 hunts,fifty-fifty auctions and dog    
 shows;some of these are held in the   
 park. Next to the Park is the Church  
 Room, now used daily by the community 
 for activities ranging from the       
 Children's Playgroup to Bingo.
