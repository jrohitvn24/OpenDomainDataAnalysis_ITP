		<title>14Playden School 40 Years Ago</title>
		<content>  Our school was built on a pond which 
 was found when the floor was rebuilt. 
 It now has 3 classrooms but used to   
 have 2. The infant classroom was added
 later and was built over the school's 
 vegetable patch. They used to get all 
 their water from an outside tank which
 was filled up each week. In front of  
 the teacher's desk was a rope. The    
 headmaster just had to lean forward   
 and pull the rope to ring the bell    
 that was on the roof. There were 2    
 cloakrooms, both very small. One is   
 now the headmaster's office. The first
 outing the school's upper juniors went
 on was to Canterbury. They came out of
 the Cathedral and asked the Archbishop
 if he would have a photo taken with   
 the juniors, so he did.
