		<title>13POCKET MONEY SURVEY.</title>
		<content> A survey was conducted in the Second  
 Year to find the average amount of    
 pocket money that children were given 
 today.                                
 100 children were questioned and the  
 average figure was Â£2 per child.      
 Many pupils had other ways of earning 
 money,for example, babysitting or     
 having a paper round,therefore, most  
 children had much more than this      
 amount to spend each week.            
 All pupils questioned believed they   
 were expected to do less work around  
 the home than in their parents day.   
 Most pupils believed this was due to  
 more labour-saving devices in the     
 home.
