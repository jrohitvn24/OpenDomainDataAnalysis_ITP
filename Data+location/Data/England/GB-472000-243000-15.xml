		<content>    The people in this village often   
 raised extra money by lace making.    
 Potterspury in fact was famous for    
 its lace making and one local lady    
 made lace for Queen Elizabeth the     
 Queen Mother when she was the Queen.  
 Entertainment would be self made in   
 the home and consisted of reading     
 stories to one another and playing    
 musical instruments or singing.       
   The general impressions gained from 
 this interview was that Potterspury   
 was a pleasant tree covered village   
 and had a quieter less crowded        
 atmosphere than that  of today.       
 Certainly in the eyes of this person  
 advancement offered no improvement.
