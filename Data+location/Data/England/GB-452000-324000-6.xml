		<title>06THE HARRY CARLTON SCHOOL</title>
		<content> The Harry Carlton School was built as 
 a Secondary Modern School to cater for
 children up to the age of fifteen.    
 There was a system of 11+selection and
 those pupils who achieved the         
 necessary standard attended grammar   
 school at West Bridgford,just south of
 Nottingham.                           
 Because of the reorganisation of      
 secondary schooling in Notts.and the  
 growth of the village,it became a     
 Comprehensive School in 1970.It now   
 serves,not only E.Leake, but the      
 surrounding villages of Sutton        
 Bonnington,Costock,Gotham,Normanton,an
 d Rempstone.                          
 The school has sixth form facilities  
 and is noted for its modern lower form
 unit.                                 
 Its examination results are amongst   
 the highest in the authority.
