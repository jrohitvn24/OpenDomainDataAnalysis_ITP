		<content> My mother goes out at half past nine  
 and visits each day two of the four   
 houses where old folk live. She helps 
 them because they are{old age         
{pensioners.}She does the{house work   
 like making beds and washing dishes.  
 Sometimes she fetches the messages.   
 Without a{home help}the people might  
 have to go to an old folk's home.     
                                       
 At 8.10 my mother wakes me and my     
 sister and gives us our breakfast. At 
 10.45 she comes to school to work as  
 an{auxiliary teacher.}She plays games 
 with the{peerie ones}(youngest        
 ones) reads stories and helps them    
 with their work. Two nights a week she
 runs the{club}in the hall. The age    
 group on Wednesdays is 5-11 and on    
 Fridays 11 and up. You can play games 
 and have juice and crisps.
