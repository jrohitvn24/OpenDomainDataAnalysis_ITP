		<title>08Occupation in Rawreth.</title>
		<content> 50 Rawreth residents were asked for   
 their jobs.These were then classified 
 as primary,secondary and tertiary.The 
 results were,primary 2,secondary 12,  
 tertiary 36.It was not surprising that
 most jobs were tertiary or services;it
 reflects the balance found in develop-
 -ed countries.What was surprising was 
 the high amount,72%.It would seem that
 this part of Essex has a high order of
 services.The type of jobs were nurse, 
 teacher and lorry driver.There were   
 fewer secondary jobs than expected.   
 This may show that manufacturing is   
 not as important in this area as else-
 -where.Secondary jobs included making 
 electrical components,carpentry and   
 printing.There were only 2 primary    
 jobs,both nurserymen.This is not      
 surprising as the industry in this    
 part of Essex is important.The soil is
 excellent, and the population growing.</content>
