		<content> THE WHIST DRIVE - One of the few      
 remaining weekly events is the Whist  
 Drive held in the village hall on     
 Friday evenings. The game played is   
 partner whist and is gaining popular- 
 ity with players coming from the      
 surrounding villages and towns but not
 from Hinxworth itself.Drives have been
 held here in the hall since it was    
 built in 1949 and prior to that in the
 former church hall at Rectory Corner. 
 THE CRICKET CLUB - The present club   
 was founded in 1979 following the     
 building of more houses and a populat-
 ion increase. It has never been able  
 to field all 11 players from the      
 village because there are just not    
 enough cricketers. 1985 has been its  
 best year despite one of the worst    
 summers for years only one match was  
 lost through rain. At the end of the  
 season a function is held in the pub. </content>
