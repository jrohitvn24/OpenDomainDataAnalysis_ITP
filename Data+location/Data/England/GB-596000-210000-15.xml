		<content> On Wendnesday 29th May 1985 Liverpool 
 were playing Juventus for the European
 cup final.   30 mins before the match,
 Liverpool supporters broke out of     
 their stands delaying the kick off by 
 1 hour.   The Liverpool supporters    
 that had been mixing with Juventus    
 supporters, started rioting, some     
 supporters started climbing a six foot
 wall in an effort to escape, in doing 
 so they brought the wall down on them,
 bring the final death total to 38 dead
 many more were injured.   As a        
 punisment all English Clubs are banned
 from playing abroad.   This ban does  
 not include the International team    
 because of this Joe Fagan retired from
 Liverpool, Kenny Dalglish has taken   
 his place.   Violance behavior at     
 football matches seems to be          
 increasing.
