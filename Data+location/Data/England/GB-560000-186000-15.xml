		<content>        St Peters church is probably   
 one of the most interesting churhes in
 Essex. The Nave &amp; Chancel are believed
 to have been built in the early       
 fifteenth century. Other parts were   
 added later. However there was a      
 church on this site in the doomsday   
 book. Up until a hundred years ago the
 roof was thatched. Because the church 
 has dirt foundations &amp; suffers from   
 woodworm, it smells damp &amp; musty.     
 There is a magnificent organ which    
 still works. The church will soon have
 to close because of its condition.    
 Also the parish is very small &amp;       
 normally only five people attend. It  
 will take about four to five thousand 
 pounds to restore.                    
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
