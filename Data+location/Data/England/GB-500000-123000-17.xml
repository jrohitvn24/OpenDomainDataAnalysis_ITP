		<content> One small commercial garden           
 specialises in rare plants, and also  
 sells bunches of garden flowers at the
 gate. Idehurst Nursery Garden, with   
 one-and-three-quarters acres, two     
 glasshouses and a large plastic-      
 covered tunnel, grows mostly fuschias.
 It is worked by the owner and his     
 wife. Nearby is a private kennels,    
 breeding Doberman pups, owned and run 
 by a woman. Crimbourne Farm is now a  
 Stud Farm with a staff of four, and   
 there is a Vet working from home. A   
 phenomena of the 1980s is for boards  
 to be displayed saying 'Bed and       
 Breakfast'. The recession has not yet 
 brought outright hardship to wealthy  
 Sussex, but many people are feeling   
 the financial pinch, and so prefer    
 cheap night stopovers when travelling.
 The service is lucrative and very     
 litle trouble.                        </content>
