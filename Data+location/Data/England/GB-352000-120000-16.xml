		<title>16Yeovilton Village</title>
		<content>   I live in{Yeovilton village,}about 2
 miles from Ilchester and 5from Yeovil.
 We have{no school}in the village so I 
 go on a special school bus to the     
 nearest one at Ilchester.             
   Yeovilton has about{30 houses,}most 
 of them quite new, surrounded by      
 fields.We have a{farmhouse,}a{nursery 
 for plants,an{airfield}right next to  
 us,a{manmade weir}on the river and    
 lots of trees.We have{no shops.       
 A 'B' road runs through the village.We
 also have St. Bartholomew's{church    
 surrounded by a graveyard..We have{no 
{bus service}or any other form of      
 public transport.                     
   It is a very quiet village but I    
 like it very much. The noise of the   
{aeroplanes}is so habitual that I have 
 become used to it;  so much so that I 
 don't consciously hear it any more!
