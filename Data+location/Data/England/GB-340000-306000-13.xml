		<title>13FASHION OF PONTESBURY YOUTH</title>
		<content> Steve buys his clothes in Shrewsbury, 
 usually at Burtons or Marks and       
 Spencers. He spends about forty pounds
 a month on his clothes. His choice is 
 tight trousers, patterned shirts and  
 bright jumpers. He likes wearing      
 short-sleeved shirts in the summer    
 and in the winter he only wears long- 
 sleeved shirts when he wears a tie.   
 He wears a tie once a week, when he   
 goes out. His favourite colours in    
 trousers are blue, black and grey. He 
 often wears black, white and grey     
 shoes too. He likes his trousers to   
 match his jumper and shirt. He prefers
 round necked jumpers, made of wool.   
 He wears a suit if he is going        
 somewhere special, like a wedding. He 
 has a grey suit and a blue suit and   
 often wears the jacket on its own with
 a separate pair of trousers - perhaps 
 to a disco.                           </content>
