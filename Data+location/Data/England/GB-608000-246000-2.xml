  There has been a garage on this spot 
for fourteen years,but there was a     
change of owner after eleven years.It  
had a wire across the drive and when a 
car drives over it,it rings a bell to  
ask for service.There were lots of gas 
cylinders for welding.                 
  They did MOT's (to check if cars are 
roadworthy) if the car is not,it must  
be taken off the road until it is      
repaired.                              
  A hydraulic elevator is used to      
hoist the car so work may be carried   
out beneath it.A garage is also used   
to get the cars fuel,usually petrol.In 
the garage was an office which you     
paid for the petrol and could buy oils 
and other accessories for the car.     
  The employers were two proffessional 
mechanics,two pump attendants,and one  
boss,the one in charge.                </content>
