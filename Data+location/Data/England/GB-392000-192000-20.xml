 has been done by{Class 3 of Crudwell  
{Primary School}with their teacher{Mrs 
{H.Russell}during the{summer term of   
{1985.}There were 14 girls and 22 boys 
 in the class.They were 8 or 9 years   
 old.13 of the children lived in the   
 area studied and the remainder came   
 from nearby villages and hamlets.9    
 children lived on farms.This was      
 helpful in doing the land cover       
 survey.Children visited shops,farms   
 and the blacksmith.{The whole class   
{enjoyed many outings and walks}to     
 study the Fossway,Church, Playing     
 Field and other amenities.Parents     
 gave help by providing transport and  
 information.They accompanied the class
 on outings and even supplied the plane
 for the aerial photograph.{Without the
{parents and children this work would  
{have been impossible!                 </content>
