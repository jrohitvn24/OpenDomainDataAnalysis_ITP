		<title>02The Growth of Ulverston</title>
		<content>   Ulverston is an{old market town}with
 buildings dating from the 17th cent-  
 ury. The oldest were built around     
 the junction of two streams;many have 
 been demolished to accommodate a car  
 park. Development of{small industries,
 such as the brewery and the mill,attr-
 acted more people to the town,and     
 housing developed north and south.    
   The{canal}(1796) and{railway}(1857) 
 led to more housing for the workers;  
 there are many pre-war houses situated
 around South Ulverston. This is now an
 industrial site with factories like   
 Glaxo. A modern housing estate,Croft- 
 lands,was built after World War Two   
 with council and private estates.There
 are also modern buildings dotted      
 around the town,such as the Library   
 and Job Centre. Development is contin-
 uing,renovating the older areas and   
 building new ones.                    </content>
