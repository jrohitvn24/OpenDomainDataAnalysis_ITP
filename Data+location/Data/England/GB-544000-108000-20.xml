		<title>20ON STAGE AT GLYNDEBOURNE</title>
		<content> Last year I played Puck in A Midsummer
 Night's Dream. I remember being called
 over the loud speaker and I walked to 
 the part of the stage where I was to  
 come on. When the cue came I burst on.
 I was a bit nervous at first but      
 forgot to be after a while. When I had
 been on stage for some time I was very
 hot. In some scenes I took off in an  
 airbourne log. I clipped onto the log 
 by a metal clip and a harness around  
 my back. When I finished I went to the
 wig room and had my wig taken off.    
 Then the make-up people removed my    
 make-up. The words did not take very  
 long to learn and neither were the    
 moves difficult but it took a lot of  
 nerves to fly on a magic log. It hurt 
 my legs to stand on the log for 5     
 minutes. On the first night I got 20  
 cards and 4 boxes of chocolates.      
 That's my favourite part of the opera.</content>
