		<title>07The Ecology of Darenth Woods</title>
		<content>{  }Darenth Wood and Ladies Wood form a
 most interesting 62 acres of          
 continuous Primary Woodland.  The area
 has been designated a Grade 1 Site of 
 Special Scientific Interest by the    
 National Conservancy Council.  Its    
 conservation value lies in its variety
 of woodland stands that reflect the   
 variation in the underlying soil; its 
 insect fauna; its well-documented     
 historical record and the presence of 
 various archeological features.       
    Coppicing has apparently been      
 practised for at least 400 years.     
 After a period of neglect a programme 
 of coppice management has been        
 reintroduced this year.  The project  
 aims to rejuvenate degenerating       
 coppice stools; to promote the        
 diversity of the ground flora and to  
 improve the wood for breeding insects 
 and birds.                            </content>
