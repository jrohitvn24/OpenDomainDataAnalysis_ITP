		<content> When{George Cadbury}moved his business
away from the city centre in 1879, he  
bought land to build both his factory  
and houses, thus providing a{healthier 
environment}for his workers and their  
families. He remained the private owner
of the land until 1900 when the        
{Bournville Village Trust}was formed to
manage the estate. From the beginning  
it has been the policy to build houses 
for both owner occupiers and tennants. 
Since the{Leasehold Reform Act of 1967}
existing leaseholders have been        
entitled to purchase their freehold.   
{The Trust}manages and maintains the   
estate properties and continues to     
develop pockets of land for residential
purposes whilst maintaining the Cadbury
tradition which began with{Â£a Factory  
in a Garden'}and has evolved into a    
city suburb with a rural atmosphere.
