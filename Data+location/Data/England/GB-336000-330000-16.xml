		<content>  A  glance around  Frankton  will show
 that this hamlet has seen better days.
 Just below the top locks can  be found
 a private house which used  to  be the
 Lock Tavern. One lock below this  used
 to be the site of a  boat repair  yard
 while the old chapel  just  round  the
 corner is derelict.                   
  Tetchill had a village primary school
 until  about  1950,  although  nothing
 remains  of it  today. This  leaves it
 with nowhere to hold meetings. It also
 had a  general store/off licence, but,
 this recently closed  as a  result  of
 shoppers travelling further in  search
 of lower prices. The local  garage has
 also closed down.                     
  Telephone kiosks are now  felt to  be
 under threat. British  Telecom are now
 looking at all kiosks taking less than
 Â£175 in cash. This applies to most of 
 our kiosks!                           </content>
