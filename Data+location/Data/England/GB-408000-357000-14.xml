     The Youth and Adult Centre is     
based in the Middle School buildings.  
     Tennis is one activity which takes
place in the school grounds on         
Tuesdays between 7.30p.m. and 9.45p.m. 
and on Sundays between 10.30a.m. and   
12.30a.m.                              
     On Tuesdays badminton also takes  
place in the school hall from 7.30p.m. 
until 9.45p.m.  A slimming club is     
also run at the same time.             
     It costs 20p per session to play  
badminton or tennis, unless you are    
still at school, when you do not have  
to pay.  All members sign an indemnity 
form before any activity.              
      Other activities include an      
art/pottery class and a                
woodwork/metalwork class, both of      
which take place on Thursday evenings.
