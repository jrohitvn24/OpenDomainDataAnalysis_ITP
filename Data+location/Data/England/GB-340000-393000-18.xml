		<title>18Motorway M57</title>
		<content>    This Motorway cuts through our     
 sector at its Eastern edge.           
    When it was built a decade ago, it 
 'clipped' 50 acres from the Knowsley  
 Estate and unfortunately destroyed a  
 Robert Adams designed gatehouse for   
 Knowsley Hall.   It joins the North   
 docks of Liverpool and Bootle to the  
 main Trans-Pennine across the country,
 the M62.                              
    Industrial Estates have grown along
 its edges from North to South, but    
 none of these are located in our      
 sector.                               
    A slip-road from the motorway to   
 Stockbridge Village has only recently 
 opened, despite the fact that it was  
 built many years ago.
