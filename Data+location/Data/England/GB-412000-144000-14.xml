		<title>14STICKS -A GAMES FOR BOYS</title>
		<content> WE PLAY A GAME CALLED STICKS. TO PLAY 
 IT YOU NEED 3 STICKS , TWO ABOUT 10CM 
 TALL AND ONE 5CM. PLACE THE TWO       
 BIGGEST STICKS AGAINST THE WALL, THEN 
 YOU BALANCE THE SHORTER STICK ON THE  
 TWO TALLER STICKS. WHEN YOU HAVE DONE 
 THAT YOU PUT THE PEOPLE IN TWO        
 DIFFERENT TEAMS. ONE TEAMS FIELDS AND 
 THE OTHER TEAM BOWLS. EACH PERSON IN  
 THE BOWLING TEAM THROWS A BALL        
 AT THE STICKS. IF IT HITS THE FLOOR   
 AND  THEN THE WALL AND SOMEONE IN THE 
 FIELDING TEAM CATCHES IT THEY ARE OUT,
 BUT IF IT HITS THE WALL FIRST NOTHING 
 HAPPENS. IF YOU KNOCK DOWN THE STICKS 
 YOUR TEAM MUST PUT THEM UP WITHOUT    
 BEING HIT BY THE BALL BECAUSE THE     
 OTHER TEAM THROWS THE BALL AT YOU. IF 
 YOU GET HIT YOU ARE OUT, WHEN THE     
 WHOLE TEAM ARE OUT YOU SWAP ROUND AND 
 DO THE SAME.                          
                                       </content>
