		<title>13MY PART-TIME JOB.</title>
		<content>                                       
   On Saturdays I have a part-time job 
in a hairdressers called Rough Cut in  
Islington.They've been there for five  
years,and I've been working there for  
ten months.Ray Rough owns the shop.I   
heard of the job because it was        
advertised in the window.              
   I give the clients a gown and get   
them a tea or coffee or a magazine.I   
sweep all the hair from the floor and  
shampoo people's hair and take colour  
and perms out.I also put towels in the 
dryer and fold them and generally tidy 
up.Istart work at 9am and finish at    
about 6.30pm and I get a 30 minute     
break.I usually get about 10 pounds    
including tips.It is a long and tiring 
day but I enjoy it.All the staff are   
friendly and so are most of the        
customers.I get on well.
