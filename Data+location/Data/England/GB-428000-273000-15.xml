		<title>15POP MUSIC IN 1985</title>
		<content>Popular, or 'pop' music today is sung  
mainly by groups.Almost all pop groups 
mime on their videos, which are usually
very good and sell the records. In     
1985 one of the most popular groups is 
'Duran Duran'. Their latest video is   
situated on the Eiffel Tower in        
France.There are very few female 'pop' 
singers but one of the most well-known 
is Madonna, who is an American. I      
listen to Radio 1 every Sunday which   
tells the Top 40. 'Top of the Pops'is  
a television programme, also shows the 
top 40. Many of the groups have four or
five members and they often break up   
and the lead singer then makes songs   
himself (or herself). A lot of bands   
make some songs and then you never     
hear of them again. My favourite       
singer at the moment is Madonna.
