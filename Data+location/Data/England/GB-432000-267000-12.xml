		<title>12THE GROWTH OF A TRADITION</title>
		<content>  Twenty five years ago the teenagers  
 of the recently formed Cubbington     
 Methodist Youth Church staged the     
 pantomime 'Dick Whittington'. Using   
 hired costumes and home-made scenery  
 it was staged in the Village Hall, and
 was a great success.                  
  The panto became an annual event,    
 moving in 1966 to the Methodist       
 Church's new hall, on a well equipped 
 stage paid for by the efforts of the  
 youngsters.                           
  The club changed its name, and       
 leaders came and went, but the panto  
 went on, always traditional in style, 
 full of music and laughter, and aimed 
 firmly at the children in the front   
 rows.                                 
  This year's performance of 'Sinbad'  
 will notch up a quarter of a century  
 of Youth Group pantos. Long may they  
 continue.                             </content>
