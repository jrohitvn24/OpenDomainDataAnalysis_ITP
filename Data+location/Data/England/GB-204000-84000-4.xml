		<content>    ECOLOGY IN THE DELABOLE AREA.      
{  Our weather(1).}By Gary Blanchard.  
    At Delabole school we have been    
 keeping a check on the weather and    
 have made charts since September 1980.
{TEMPERATURE.}From our charts we have  
 discovered on average we only have 12 
 days in a year below 0. We have found 
 out that the{coldest months}in the    
 year are generally November,December  
 and January but winter can be mild.The
{hottest months}are June,July and      
 August. The average maximum           
 temperature is 31 C.These are the     
 months holiday visitors come. In the  
 summer the weather is most right for  
 swimming in July and August and is    
 right for  a good suntan which we all 
 love.in the winter we can get heavy   
 rain but as far as I remember we have 
 only had{snow}in two of the last 5    
 years,and not much then.              </content>
