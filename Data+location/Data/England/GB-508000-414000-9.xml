		<content> At school we have playtimes, before   
 school, at lO.3O and at 2.3O. At the  
 first playtime everyone goes out but  
 not the infants, they have their own  
 playtime later. The playground has a  
 netball court and at the side of it   
 there is a hop-scotch and some        
 circles. At the other side there are  
 some squares and other shapes and     
 lines that you can go on with your    
 cars. At playtime we usually play run 
 across. When you play run across you  
 run from one end of the netball court 
 to the other end. Sometimes we play   
 netball and football. Sometimes we    
 play with our power balls and         
 sometimes we have conkers. In the     
 Summer we can play on the grass and we
 play fighting and rolling about. We   
 also play cat and mouse on the middle 
 square. Playtimes are about l5 minutes
 but at dinner we have an hour to play.</content>
