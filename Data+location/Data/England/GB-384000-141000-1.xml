		<title>01GENERAL DESCRIPTION</title>
		<content> This block of land is definitely rural
 England influenced by the fact that it
 almost all was or is part of the      
 Longleat Estat. Its proximity to      
 Warminster and the Army there make it 
 a desirable rural residential area.   
 One major road crosses it:- the A360  
 Warminster to Shaftesbury, following  
 the Wylye Valley. most of the area is 
 woodland and pasture. Crockerton is a 
 scattered village with no particular  
 centre. Shearwater is a local beauty  
 spot for walking, riding, fishing and 
 sailing. An out-of-town shopping and  
 garden centre has grown where an old  
 brick works used to be, by the river. 
 The village school thrives in         
 Crockerton but the church and two     
 chapels are closed. Longbridge        
 Deverill Church, which is just in this
 block is open but the school is now   
 the village hall.                     </content>
