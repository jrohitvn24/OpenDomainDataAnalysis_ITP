		<title>03A Family Weekend.</title>
		<content> The weekend began on Friday evening   
 when Abigail, my friend,came to       
 play.We played a game called          
 "Block".Then Abigail had to go home   
 because we were going to have our     
 tea.We had egg and beans on toast.When
 we had finished our tea we went       
 outside and played swing ball in the  
 garden.At 8.00pm we came in and had a 
 bath.At half past 8 we went to bed.   
      On Saturday I got up at 7.00am   
 and fed the pig and cleaned her       
 out.For lunch we had lamb.In the      
 afternoon we went to Elvington Garden 
 Party.We played with Rebecca in the   
 garden at Elvington.                  
      At 5pm we went home Ifound that  
 my coconut was mouldy but as it was   
 late we could not change it! After tea
 we had a game of Monopoly and  went to
 bed at 10.30 p.m.
