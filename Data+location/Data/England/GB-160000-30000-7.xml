		<content> Farming and its associated services   
 are still the main source of          
 employment in our area.  However, the 
 numbers employed in farming are going 
 down steadily owing to the use of     
 modern machinery and the joining of   
 small farms into larger units.        
                                       
 A number of people from the area are  
 employed in and around the larger     
 towns of Helston and Camborne/Redruth 
 in a variety of occupations.          
                                       
 There are a rising number of          
 unemployed people, especially among   
 school-leavers as many local firms    
 have closed down or are not taking on 
 new employees.                        
 Prospects for the future are not      
 encouraging at the present time.
