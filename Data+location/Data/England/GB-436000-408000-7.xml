		<title>07CARLTON NATURE RESERVE</title>
		<content>{Carlton Nature Reserve}was established
 in 1976 by local volunteers and       
 Barnsley Borough Council who owned the
 land. Mining subsidence made Shaw Dike
 flood the area to make the marshland. 
 The Reserve has forty acres and is    
 four feet deep in the middle; the area
 has{marshland and both dry and damp   
{grassland.}The damp grassland to the  
 south has lots of{wild flowers;}the   
 dry grassland, also to the south, has 
 mostly been destroyed by farming. The 
 rarest visitors are the{Dartford      
{Warbler}and the{Alpine Swift;}over 50 
 species of bird, including{Coot,      
{Moorhen, Mallard}have been seen. 3000 
 birds have been ringed since 1976.    
 Many problems are caused by vandals   
 who rip down fences and raid nests as 
 well as the smoke and noise from the  
 nearby{scrapyards.}The Wardens say    
 "The more damage, the less Nature."   </content>
