		<title>01INTRODUCTION TO KENDAL</title>
		<content> The town of Kendal{(Kentdale)}has been
 supplying the needs of its citizens   
 since before the last Domesday survey.
 Its  large{Parish Church}with its     
 relic of a Saxon cross stands on the  
 site of a church mentioned in the     
 first Domesday Survey.Kirkbie Kendal  
 is the name carried to this day by our
 school.A further link is provided by  
 the name of the main street which is  
 called{Stricklandgate}where for       
 centuries cattle (stirks) were driven 
 along the road(gate) to pastureland in
 the North.                            
  The town is sheltered from the W.by a
 carboniferous limestone outcrop       
{Cunswick Scar,(200m)}whose thin dry   
 soil supports Herdwick and Swaledale  
 sheep and slopes down to the lusher   
 boulder clay and alluvium pastures    
 where Fresian dairy and crossbred     
 cattle are reared.                    </content>
