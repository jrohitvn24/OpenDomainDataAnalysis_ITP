		<title>04Tourism: Poldark Mine Museum</title>
		<content>      At the end of Poldark Mine there 
 are several museum rooms in which you 
 will see lots of items which were used
 many years ago: the felt hats which   
 the miners used to wear with candles  
 on them, different tools which they   
 used in the mine, such as picks,      
 shovels and hammers.  There are the   
 shoes which the miners would have worn
 and a model of a Bal Maiden dressed as
 she would have been when she worked at
 the mine.  There are lots of minerals 
 and rocks and even a book in which the
 people who worked there had their     
 names put down with how much pay they 
 had.  In one room there is an         
 ultra-violet light, which makes some  
 of the colours in the stones look very
 funny.  I think the museum rooms are  
 very interesting because they tell you
 about the old miners.
