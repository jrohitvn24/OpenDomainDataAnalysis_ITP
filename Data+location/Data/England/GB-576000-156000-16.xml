		<title>16FARMING - SOIL &amp; CROPS</title>
		<content> The soils and relief of the area are  
such that  only a limited amount of any
one type of farming can be done on each
soil.  On the top of the Downs the soil
is fertile, with a clay base and a ph  
of 7.5.  The clay traps the water      
making the land suitable for wheat,    
barley and rape. On the scarp slope of 
the Downs the soil on the chalk upland 
is very thin and dry supporting only   
sparse growth such as beech and yew    
trees.  At the base of the chalk clay  
is found, which is saturated to various
degrees according to the time of year. 
This lends itself to grazing and fodder
crops. On the lower slopes of Boxley,  
where the soil is not saturated or     
acid, orchards of pear and apple are   
found. Further south sandstone appears 
which cannot support substantial crops 
because of drainage, thin soil and acid
