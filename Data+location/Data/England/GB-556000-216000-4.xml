 3 of 3{Footpaths.                     
  There is a good network of{footpaths 
{and bridle paths}in this area. One    
 stretches from the corner of Green    
 Street and goes all the was to Alburys
 Farm. The footpath runs between fields
 and is one of the few places in an    
 arable farming area where it is       
 possible to walk, ride walk dogs, ride
 bicycles etc. freely without worrying 
 about the traffic on the roads or the 
 farmers' crops.                       
 It is a good indication of changing   
 seasons, varying from deep snow in    
 winter when it is almost unpassable to
 spring with wild flowers beginning to 
 appear and summer when the track is   
 dusty and dry. Best of all is autumn  
 when the acorns are falling from the  
 oak trees and all the trees turn a    
 glorious colour.                      </content>
