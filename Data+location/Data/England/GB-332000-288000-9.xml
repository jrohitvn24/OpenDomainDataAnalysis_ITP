		<content>   Every Friday Bishops Castle has a   
{cattle and sheep}auction.All the local
 farmers bring live stock to be sold in
 the sale ring.                        
   The sale ring is in the corner of   
 the auction yard. The auctioneer has  
 a special stand and there are seats   
 going up from the sale ring.There is  
 also a bar where a lot of farmers go  
 for a drink.                          
   The weighing area is next to the    
 sale ring,it is like a sort of        
 platform with a gate each side.The    
 cattle are weighed and taken to their 
 pens.                                 
   Most of the farmers wear cloth caps 
 and boiler suits with a coat on top.  
 They are mostly wearing wellies but   
 some are wearing boots.They go round  
 the pens looking at the cattle and    
 sheep deciding what to buy and discuss
 ing how their crops are growing.      </content>
