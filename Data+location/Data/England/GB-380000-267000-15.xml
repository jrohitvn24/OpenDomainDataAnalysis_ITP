		<content> By Sara Layton                        
 The area of Bells Fruit Farm covers   
 about 120 acres. The land has belonged
 to the Bell family since 1909,about   
 76 years.The house itself is 300 years
 old.17 years ago they decided to go   
 into the Pick Your Own business.They  
 were only the second farm in the whole
 country to do this.Before 1968 they   
 grew cereal crops,vegetables and      
 fruit, they also bred pigs and        
 cattle.Now they grow mainly           
 fruit,although they have got one large
 field for vegetables.They spend the   
 whole year working;During July_August 
 they plant the next summers           
 seeds.During the rest of the year they
 are kept busy weeding and hoeing.They 
 do not grow anything using green_     
 houses.
