		<content> There are  various clubs  in  Silloth,
 some  only social  but some  connected
 with  sport.   The {Social Club }is  a
 social meeting place in Waver St. with
 a bar, dance floor, etc., and  can  be
 hired for parties.  The {R.A.F.A. Club
 ( Royal Air Force Assn.)  has  various
 bars, and puts on light entertainment.
 Very few of the members are now ex-RAF
 as the War was so long ago.  The{Round
{Table Club }is  for young ( under-40 )
 business and professional  men, whilst
 the{Rotary Club}is the same thing  but
 without an upper age limit.The{Ladies'
{Circle }and the {Inner Wheel }are  the
 respective clubs for their wives.  The
{Old  Age  Pensioners' Club }has  their
 clubhouse in the playing field.  There
 are a few other clubs like the{Womens'
{Institute,}etc.
