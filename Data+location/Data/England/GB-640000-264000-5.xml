		<title>05HOUSING, THEBERTON</title>
		<content> Most of the property, other than parts
 of Theberton is old, varying from     
 16th century to Victorian and mostly  
 farmhouse or cottage. East Green has  
 one or two houses built this century  
 but there is a spate of new but       
 unfinished building happening in      
 Theberton amongst the cottages,       
 reflecting the gradual increase in    
 population. All domestic property has 
 to have plans submitted and approved  
 by the Suffolk Coastal District       
 Authority, but the addition of farm   
 buildings for agricultural purposes   
 needs neither plans presented or      
 approved resulting in some lovely     
 farmhouses bing dwarfed and surrounded
 by gross grain stores, huge barns and 
 store buildings, in some cases several
 times the size of the farmhouse. There
 are 4 large houses in the area dating 
 from the turn of the century.         </content>
