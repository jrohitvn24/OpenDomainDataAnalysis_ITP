		<title>05BUN THROWING IN ABINGDON</title>
		<content>In 1981 when the Prince of Wales got   
married, they threw buns off the top   
of the County  Hall in Abingdon.  It   
was quite a chilly morning.  The market
square was crowded, people coult catch 
the buns and keep them as souveniers. I
was six years old and I went with my   
mum.  The first bun throwing day was in
1760 for King George 111 coronation.   
The next bun throwing day was for the  
coronation of King George 1V in 1821.  
"The Chamberlain was sent to buy l,OOO 
penny cakes".  In 1842 buns were thrown
for the christening of The Prince of   
Wales.  Nobody knows how it all started
but it is a unique custom.  At the     
celebration for the Silver Jubilee of  
Queen Elizabeth 11 in 1977 buns were   
thrown, the next celebration was for   
the Queen Mother's eightieth birthday  
in 1980. Written by Claire Pullen aged
