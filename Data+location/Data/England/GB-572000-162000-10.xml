		<content>{Doctor's Surgery:}there were three    
 doctors and two receptionists.Each    
 doctor has about 2,810 patients.Before
 it was a surgery it was just a plot of
 land.                                 
{The Dentist:}the dentist has been open
 for nineteen years.Before that it was 
 a private house,which is in King      
 George Road.A road leading off this   
 road is Meadow Close.House number     
 thirteen was missed out because it is 
 unlucky.We asked some questions and   
 these are the results:A man who has   
 lived in the area for 75 years said   
 that there were no buses, just trams  
 and coaches.He also said that if      
 anyone lost a job they could get a new
 one the next day.                     
{House Types:}most of the houses are   
 either terraced or semi-detached with 
 some being detached or bungalows. .   
{Travel:}most people travel by buses.  </content>
