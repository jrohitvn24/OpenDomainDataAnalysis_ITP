		<title>20High Lorton 1752/1985</title>
		<content>   On one of his three visits to the   
 area,in{1752,John Wesley}wrote in his 
 diary:'..Lorton,a little village lying
 in a fruitful valley, surrounded by   
 high mountains,the sides of which are 
 covered with grass and woods,and the  
 bottom watered by two small rivers.'  
   The hills,streams,grass and trees   
 are still here,as are the buildings of
 that time.Roads follow the same lines.
   Some village craftsmen have gone:the
 smith,millers and joiners,but the main
 industry,{sheep-farming,}still domin- 
 ates the valley and fells.            
   This record has been compiled in    
{July 1985}by the 10 upper-junior      
 children of{Lorton Primary School}:   
 Vicky Albon,Frederick Boardman,Robert 
 Hannah,Timothy Newton,Lucy Nixon,     
 Esther Rushton, Kevin Shield,Martin   
 Teasdale,Karl Tyson and Stephen Wills,
 plus their teacher,Mr.D.Morriss.      </content>
