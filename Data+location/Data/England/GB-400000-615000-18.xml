		<title>18ARABLE FARMING</title>
		<content> Although the area has a good deal of  
 high ground the valley is used for    
 intensive arable farming.             
   A crop of some importance is        
 Barley.This is either sown in Autumn  
 or Spring.Wheat and Oats are also     
 grown but are less common due to the  
 climate of the area.A crop which is   
 beginning to appear is Oilseed        
 rape.Some farms grow small areas of   
 potatoes but these are mostly for     
 their own use.Hay and Silage are also 
 grown.The hay is baled in square bales
 or round bales.                       
    Haytime in the area is around early
 July ,silage is taken in mid-June and 
 harvest is any time in August         
 depending upon the weather.           
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
