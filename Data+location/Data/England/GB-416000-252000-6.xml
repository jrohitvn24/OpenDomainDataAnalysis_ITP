		<content>  In Stratford many houses are large   
Victorian terraces, catering for the   
summer influx of tourists. Shottery,on 
the outskirts, is in a picturesque     
setting with many expensive houses and 
cottages with well-cultivated gardens  
and double garages. The villages of    
Luddington and Clifford Chambers are   
more rural, and transport to Stratford 
is essential for residents.            
  Generally, Stratford shops are expen-
sive because of the tourist industry.  
However, second-hand clothes shops co- 
exist with small boutiques.One betting 
shop has recently closed;but gambling  
is popular at the racecourse.          
  Subcultures are limited to Ely Street
in cental Stratford. They consist      
mainly of young people:-punks,scooter  
boys and a few Heavy Metal motorbike   
enthusiasts.
