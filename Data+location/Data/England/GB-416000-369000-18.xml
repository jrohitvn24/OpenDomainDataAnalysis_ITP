		<title>18FARMING. A TYPICAL FARM</title>
		<content> I have a very varied type of farm,as  
 far as the land goes,rising from      
 approx. 500' river level to 1,000' at 
{Fin Cop,a Roman look out post or      
{tumulus,}over_looking Monsal Dale.    
 The farm is 250 acres,130 are rough,  
 steep grazing,typical of Derbys.,     
 incapable of much improvement, it is  
 too steep &amp; dangerous for tractors.   
 The remainder is permanent grass &amp;    
 arable,a small amount of barley &amp;     
 2 acres of potatoes.The grass is for  
 grazing cattle &amp; sheep,in late Spring 
 some is fenced off for growing silage 
 &amp; hay for Winter feed.Over the years  
 production has increased due to mod.  
 methods.Chemicals are kept to a min.  
 The pattern of farming has changed    
 very little over 30 years,no hedges   
 grubbed out,trees felled or walls     
 removed.We have changed from milk to  
 beef.Much more machinery is used.     </content>
