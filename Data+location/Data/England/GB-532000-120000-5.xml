 Day old Mallards are bought in, kept  
 at 80 degrees and fed on concentrates.
 At 8 weeks they are dispersed around  
 the ponds on the estate. Game birds   
 are also bought in at 6 to 12 weeks.  
                                       
 Magpies, jays and foxes have to be    
 kept down or they will attack the     
 birds. At one time the estate was     
 overrun with rabbits but they are not 
 now a problem.                        
                                       
 A stream was dammed in 1965 to form a 
 pond which is stocked with carp,roach,
 and tench. A second lake was formed in
 1979. There are up to 600 ducks and   
 geese on the water.
