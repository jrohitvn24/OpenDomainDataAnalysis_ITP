		<title>07Birdham Parish Church</title>
		<content> Birdham Chuch is dedicated to St.James
 and consists of a 14th century nave, a
 West tower and South porch of the     
 middle 16th century, and a modern     
 chancel. The tower holds 2 bells.     
 There is a very narrow and low blocked
 North doorway which by tradition is   
 reputed to have been of 'ritual use   
 for the exit of the Devil' during the 
 Sacrament of baptism.                 
 There is a newly installed East window
 presented by the Master Glazier of the
 Guild of Glaziers and represents the  
 call of St. James in the setting of   
 Chichester Harbour.                   
 In the Churchyard there is an enormous
 yew tree with a peculiar twisted stem.
 The part time Priest-in-Charge is also
 a lecturer at the Chichester College  
 of Theology.
