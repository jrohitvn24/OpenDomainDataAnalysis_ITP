		<title>01Brief description of area</title>
		<content> The area is situated{25 miles S.W. of 
{London}and is, as a whole, sparsely   
 populated. Most of the land is taken  
 up by{woodland and farmland.}The      
 fields, in general, are used for      
 grazing. The area to the N.W. of      
 our zone is particularly densely      
 wooded, most of the trees being       
 evergreens with intermitent oak and   
 sycamore. The roads in the area       
 are good, all being metalled. The     
{motorway (M25)}which has recently been
 built through the area rather spoils  
 the scenery but makes access to the   
 City of London much easier. Access can
 also be gained to this area along the 
 railway by disembarking at{Effingham  
{Junction.}For those who enjoy walking,
 the area has plenty of footpaths.     
 There is little sign of vandalism     
 and the countryside is unspoilt by    
 heavy industry.                       </content>
