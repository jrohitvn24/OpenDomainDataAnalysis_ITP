		<title>14YEAVELEY SCHOOL IN 1985</title>
		<content>    In 1985 Yeaveley school has 19     
 pupils, 5 infants and 14 juniors.  We 
 use the old school building for       
 dinner, P.E., etc. We work in a       
 two-room Terrapin; one is for lessons 
 and another for art and craft. Some of
 the lessons we have include Maths and 
 English. We do a lot of topics. We    
 have done Indians, Eskimoes, Wheels,  
 Tudors, Weather and sight. Each week  
 we go swimming at the Ashbourne baths.
 We also do other sports like running, 
 and join in the Dove Valley Swimming  
 Gala and Sports Day. We also have a   
 Sports Day of our own.                
    When we are 11 we go to Queen      
 Elizabeth's Grammar School in         
 Ashbourne. At the end of this year the
 other pupils of this school will go to
 Longford School in the next village   
 as this school is closing as there    
 would be only 13 pupils left here.    </content>
