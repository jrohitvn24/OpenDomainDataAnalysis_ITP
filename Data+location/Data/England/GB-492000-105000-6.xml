		<content>   There has been lots of {changes}in  
 Aldingbourne since 1949.There were    
 farms, woods, fields and the          
 occasional farm house.Now Aldingbourne
 is just houses,roads and a few        
 fields.One of the biggest changes is  
 that some of{Aldingbourne rife}has    
 been drained and a road and some      
 houses have been built along it.Some  
 of the woods are now gone.Some of the 
 farms have gone or changed names.A    
{hospital}has been built next to       
 what used to be Aldingbourne house at 
 least there is still a few places that
 still exist, like Slindon park and    
 Oldberry farm.There is still a public 
 house near croker hill.And northfield 
 farm still exsists which used to be   
 near Eastergate lane,which is now the 
{A29.}We have found that there has been
 many changes in the past 30 years.
