		<content>David Rampley and Fergus McVey are two 
typical 11 year old boys in our area.  
We asked them to tell us about what    
they did in their leisure time. They   
both said that they played computer    
games. Fergus said that his favourite  
game was Attic Attack. David is        
interested in wild life and has made   
his own bird box in woodwork lessons.  
They are both keen on sports. They     
visit the Sports Centre regularly. When
they leave school they would like to be
engineers. They often make models from 
a variety of materials.                
Emma Gardham and Faith Russell use the 
Sports Centre. They go trampolining and
have started to play short tennis. They
go to High Wycombe to swim because     
there is no public pool in Thame. Most 
of the children like pop music and the 
favourite group is Duran Duran.
