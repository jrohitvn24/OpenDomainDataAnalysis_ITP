		<title>20NATURE TRAIL AT IBSTOCK</title>
		<content>   The building of a nature trail in   
 Ibstock over the last few years has   
 pleased many villagers.               
   It was the idea of Mr Vic Price and 
 Mr Alan Fairbrother who felt that an  
 overgrown spinney between Pretoria    
 Road and Spring Road could be put to  
 better use.                           
   Another reason was that the nearby  
 cemetery between the two roads was    
 often used as a short cut, occasional 
 vandalism resulting.                  
   The nature trail link, built at a   
 cost of Â£2,500, has eliminated much of
 this vandalism.                       
   Features of the nature trail are the
 120-year-old beech trees, which       
 normally grow on chalk soil but are   
 thriving on the Ibstock clay, and a   
 pond onto which it is hoped to        
 introduce some bird life.
