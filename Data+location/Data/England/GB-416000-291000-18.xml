		<content> THIS SUBJECT DOES NOT HAVE ANYTHING TO
 DO WITH LIFE IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES,
 BUT ALWAYS SEEMS TO INTEREST PEOPLE.  
 SIGHTINGS TOLD ABOUT IN CURDWORTH,    
 ARE, OF A CAVALIER, SEEN IN A YARD IN 
 DAYLIGHT; AN OLD MAN SITTING IN THE   
 LOUNGE OF A NEWLY BUILT HOUSE; A MAN  
 IN BYEGONE CLOTHING IN COLESHILL ROAD;
 OTHER TALES INCLUDE THE COACH AND     
 HORSES APPEARING ONCE A YEAR IN CHURCH
 LANE; A WHITE HORSE ON THE CORNER,    
 OPPOSITE THE SAME NAMED PUBLIC        
 HOSTELRY, REPUTEDLY SEEN BY A         
 CLERGYMAN, (WHO WAS NOT LEAVING THE   
 SAID HOSTELRY). MOTORISTS HAVE SWERVED
 TO AVOID A WOMAN SEEN ON KINGSBURY    
 ROAD, WHO HAS DISAPPEARED WHEN THEY   
 HAVE LOOKED BACK. BUILDINGS NOW       
 DEMOLISHED THAT WERE SAID TO BE       
 HAUNTED WERE THE OLD RECTORY AND A    
 FARM THAT REPUTEDLY HOUSED A          
 POLTERGEIST.                          </content>
