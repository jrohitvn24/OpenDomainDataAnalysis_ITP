		<title>15Buildings - Tudor Grange</title>
		<content> Tudor Grange was built between 1886   
 and 1899 by the{Lovekins.}            
 Sir Alfred Bird owned the Grange from 
 1899 to 1922. His widow, Lady Bird,   
 lived there until her death at the age
 of 92. The Bird family are famous for 
 their custard powder.                 
   Solihull U.D.C. bought it in 1947/48
 The Red Cross had bought it in 1945 to
 use as a hospital for the soldiers    
 from the war. The council made it into
 a special school for mentally         
 handicapped children, but now it is   
 used by Solihull Technical College as 
 part of its campus.
