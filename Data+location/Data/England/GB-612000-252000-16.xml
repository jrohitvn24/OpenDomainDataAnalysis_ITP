		<content> Parents living in and around Coddenham
 and Hemingstone hope their children   
 benefit greatly from living in the    
 country. There could be a lack of     
 independence for young people but in  
 general the teenagers appreciate      
 country life. Most folk born and bred 
 in this area and those who have come  
 to it and lived here for many years   
 can conceive of no other way of life  
 and are grateful to be able to live in
 such an unspoilt area. They are sad   
 however that often large lorries using
 the minor roads in this block are a   
 worry and a danger to pedestrians and 
 in addition, vibrations can undermine 
 the structure of the older houses,    
 resulting in each individual having to
 protect his own environment; if people
 feel strongly on certain issues, they 
 can organise protests through the     
 Parish Council first.                 </content>
