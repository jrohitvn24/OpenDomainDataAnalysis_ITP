		<content>    This D Block includes the north    
 west tip of the Greater Manchester    
 conurbation in its south east corner, 
 whilst a swathe of green belt holds   
 the middle ground before we reach the 
 Lancashire village of Adlington to the
 north west.                           
                                       
    The most remarkable feature might  
 be the great Lower Rivington reservoir
 in the east but an aerial view will   
 bring out the significance of the M61 
 motorway which almost bisects the     
 block from north to south as well as  
 the landscaped acres of the great     
 Viscount Leverhulme's legacy of       
 Rivington Country Park.               
                                       
    The following pages will refer in  
 detail to these features and to the   
 people of Horwich, Blackrod and       
 Adlington.                            </content>
