		<content> Recently the{Roman Road}that goes     
 through the village was rediscovered. 
 This Roman Road goes to the Roman City
 of Deva (Chester). In the fields      
 outside the village the road was      
 discovered about 30cm. below the      
 surface. Whilst digging,{2 roads}were 
 found alongside each other, a quickly 
 built road and a more permanent road. 
 In the road was found a{wooden plough,
 now at{Manchester University.         
 Alongside the road has been discovered
{the remains of a building.}The dig is 
 still taking place. The stone{stocks  
 are to be found by the village green. 
 They were used in days gone by for    
 punishing people who had done wrong.  
 Around our area are many{wells}       
 from which people in the past         
 collected water. Our school dates back
 to 1872.
