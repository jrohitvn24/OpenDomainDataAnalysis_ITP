		<content>A day at school is quite busy and we   
learn lots of new things.First we      
hang up our coats and bags and go out  
to play.At 9.00am someone blows a      
whistle and we go into our classroom   
for the register.We read a book        
until Assembly at 9.10am.On Mondays the
effort cup and swimming certificates   
are given out and birthdays are        
mentioned.After Assembly we do Maths   
until snack playtime comes at  10.40am.
At 11.00am  we have English and on     
Fridays we have Spelling and           
Music.Soon it's dinner time when some  
people have a cooked meal and others   
have a packed lunch.After dinner it's  
Art and Craft or Topic.At 2.10pm  we   
have last play. Last lesson is         
Games,Physical Education, History or   
Science.We may have a story before we  
say our prayers and go home at 3:30pm.
