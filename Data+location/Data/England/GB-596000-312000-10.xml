		<content> Although National Statistics show that
 crime is on the increase, in Dereham  
 it seems the Police have most crime   
 under control.                        
 Dereham Police Station has four       
 policemen actually on the beat in the 
 town,there are also mobile police     
 officers, but they deal with the      
 surrounding area as well as assisting 
 the local police if required.  There  
 is also a civilian administration     
 staff of thirteen, and two traffic    
 wardens which also work at Swaffham   
 and Watton.                           
 The Probation Service with its staff  
 of four has an office adjacent to the 
 Magistrates Court in the Towns        
 Assembly Rooms.  Fourteen Magistrates 
 deal with minor crimes each Friday    
 with the Juvenile Court fortnightly on
 Wednesdays.                           
                                       </content>
