		<content>Many of Cottingham's employed residents
work in British Steel's Corby          
tubeworks. The second largest group is 
of retired people, the third group work
in the shoe industry. The biggest farm,
other than Rockingham Estates, is owned
by Mr Reynolds and is 300 acres. 2 men 
do the work done by 20 in earlier days 
when 10 smallholders held 30 acres. The
older dwellings are thought to have    
been built from local stone quarried   
from the Dale. The newer housing       
estates (Ripley Rd., Bancroft Rd., Bury
Field Rd., Welland View, School Lane   
and Millfields) consist mainly of      
detached, 2-storey brick houses with   
small gardens front and rear. Most     
common surnames now are Claypole,      
Bradshaw, Harrison and Perkins.        
Cottingham is a desirable residential  
area ideal for home owners, but house  
prices are high compared with Corby's. </content>
