		<title>20THE DIVIDED VILLAGE</title>
		<content>Do tensions and divisions lie beneath a
tranquil surface? On one side the old  
village folk,wanting continuance of    
traditional village life,they went to  
the village school and work locally. On
the other side,wealthy newcomers,paying
inflated house prices which are beyond 
the reach of local youngsters.         
Some newcomers work away from the      
locality, do not use the Village       
School,are drawn to the country as a   
peaceful retreat from the frenzy of    
urban life. The attitudes of these to  
village life is very different from    
those whose families originated here   
and deep rooted sensitivities can be   
ignored. Financial status or success   
emerge as the measure by which people  
are judged and valued. Is this the     
true way of a country village?
