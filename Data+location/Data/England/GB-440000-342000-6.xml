 Smalley village may be small but there
 are quite alot of things for the      
 residents to do during leisure time.  
 For the children there are scout and  
 cub groups. If you are interested in  
 drawing there is an art group, or you 
 could watch Stainsby Cricket Club and 
 Smalley Villa football club if you are
 a sports fanatic. For the older       
 generation there is a bingo club which
 runs every week. On Sundays there are 
 Sunday schools for the children and   
 two recreation grounds for the under  
 eighteens and the under fifteens.     
 There are two public houses where you 
 could go every night. There is a card 
 playing club which also runs every    
 week. The Bell Inn is owned by a man  
 called John Frederic Simms, it has a  
 car park, and a beer garden. The other
 public house is the Nags Head.        </content>
