		<content> I get up in the morning when my alarm 
clock wakes me at 8 o'clock. I get out 
of my bed and I have a wash. Then I get
dressed into my school uniform, which  
is green and white.                    
 For breakfast I eat Coco-Crispies with
sugar and milk. Next I clean my teeth  
and comb my hair. I have my hair       
plaited or in a pony tail. Then I go to
school with my friend in her Nanny's   
car.                                   
 At school we start by having an       
Assembly for everyone in the hall. In  
our classrooms we have lessons like    
Mathematics, English, Stories, Nature, 
and Topic. I have my dinner at school  
in the dining room.                    
 After school I change my clothes and  
play in the garden until it is time    
for tea. After tea I watch television  
until it is time for bed at 9 o'clock.
