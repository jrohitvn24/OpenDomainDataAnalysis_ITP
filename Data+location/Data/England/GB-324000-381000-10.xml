		<title>10TRANSPORT AROUND PENSBY</title>
		<content>     In our survey, 54% of people      
 interviewed lived in Heswall itself,  
 12% came from Pensby, 11% from Gayton,
 8% from Irby and 5% from Neston,      
 Barnston and Birkenhead. Therefore the
 majority of the shoppers lived within 
 3Km of the village.                   
     Most people we spoke to came to   
 Heswall twice a week. They came for   
 shopping although one or two worked   
 here. We also asked them how they had 
 travelled into the village on that    
 (sunny) day in June. 70% came by car, 
 13% came on the bus and 17% walked.   
     The high percentage of car use    
 seems to relate to the class structure
 in the area, with most families owning
 one car, and many having two. This is 
 reinforced if we look at how the      
 children get to their Cub or Brownie  
 meeting. A massive 68.6% travel by car
 but only 31.4% walk.                  </content>
