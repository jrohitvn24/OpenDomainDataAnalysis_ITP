		<title>16BUSSES IN THE DISTRICT</title>
		<content>   Until 1965 there was a railway      
 station in Otley. This was closed and 
 the land where the station was is now 
 part of the Otley by-pass. The only   
 public transport now is the bus       
 service. There is a very good service 
 to Leeds and Ilkley, and to Bradford  
 and Harrogate, and there are local    
 busses to Weston Estate and to the    
 villages around Otley. All these bus  
 services are run by the National Bus  
 Company West Yorkshire branch. The    
 Leeds, Ilkley, Bradford and Harrogate 
 routes are usually double deck busses,
 and the others are single deck.       
   Otley has a coach company as well.  
 It is called Beecroft's, and the      
 garage is at the side of the main road
 to Menston. They run some of the      
 school services, and do private hire  
 as well.
