 miles S.E. of Bedford,located close to
 the communication networks of the A1  
 and M1.                               
  Old Warden first originated from the 
 name Weard-dun (watch hill) with the  
 word 'Old' appearing just before

 picturesque villages in Bedfordshire  
 attracting many summer visitors,with  
 its quaint thatched cottages,its      
 famous Swiss Garden and the displays

 rebuilt in the 19th century as a model
 settlement to house the tenants of the
 local landowner,Lord Ongley.In the    
 late 19th century the Old Warden      
 Estate was bought by Joseph
