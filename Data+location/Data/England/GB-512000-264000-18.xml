		<content>    There are two Village Stores/Post  
 Offices in our area - one in Perry    
 and one in Gt.Staughton. Both have    
 long opening hours and stock a wide   
 range of food and household goods.    
    Although our survey showed that    
 most people do their bulk shopping in 
 St.Neots or Huntingdon, the Village   
 Stores are used daily by 33% and      
 weekly by 60% of the Sample for day to
 day items.                            
    Gt.Staughton also has a Butcher's, 
 an Electrical/Plumbing/D.I.Y. Shop    
 (incorporating a Building Soc.Office) 
 and three Public Houses (with another 
 in Perry).                            
    There is an attractive Arts and    
 Crafts Centre - the Taggart Gallery - 
 by the Church, and in The Highway is  
 O'Dell's Garage (4* petrol at Â£1.98   
 per gallon) with Workshop area for    
 vehicle servicing and repairs.        </content>
