		<title>12Tamar Valley, Pentillie Est.</title>
		<content> The Pentillie Estate has been part of{
{local history}since the year 1242 but 
 today is run as a modern{farming}     
 concern. There are eight tenanted     
 farms specialising mainly in dairy    
 herds but with some beef and sheep    
 rearing and a little arable farming.  
 'Home Farm' also has about 400 acres  
 of grass keep which is put out to     
 tender.                               
 At Tinnel Farm a{flying}crop-spraying 
 business has been started using       
 helicopters which provides a service  
 for local as well as distant farms.   
 A large area of the estate, some 420  
 acres, is given over to woodlands,    
 mainly of a broadleaf variety, which  
 provides ample cover for large numbers
 of pheasants and other game. Shooting 
 rights are let out to individuals or  
 syndicates who wish to take part in   
 this special kind of{recreation.      </content>
