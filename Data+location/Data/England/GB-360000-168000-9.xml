		<content> We play all sorts of games out in the 
 playground. We play skipping games,   
 running games. Games have been going  
 on for years. In our playgroynd we    
 have printed games on the floor like  
 hopscotch. We play netball, football  
 and rounders. Most of the boys play   
 football and most girls play rounders 
 and netball. There are lots of new    
 games out now. Boys sometimes play    
 cricket in the Summer and girls play  
 rounders. In rounders you have a bat  
 and someone throws a ball at you and  
 you have to hit it and run around the 
 outside of four posts. There are      
 people standing by the posts who can  
 stop you running a rounder by catching
 the ball and touching the post.Cricket
 is played by having having two teams  
 of 11. One batting and one fielding.
