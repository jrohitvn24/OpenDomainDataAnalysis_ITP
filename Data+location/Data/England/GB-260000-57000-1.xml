		<content>        Three quarters of this block is
 Dartmoor National Parkland.It consists
 of fields,moorland and temperate      
 woodland.The{fields}around the        
 moorland are rough grazing and those  
 lower down are larger and intensively 
 managed grassland.The{moorland}is part
 of the{Forest of Dartmoor}but         
 unconnected to the main moor.It offers
 excellent views in all directions. The
{woodland}is in the main,natural but   
 there is a small amount of Forestry   
 Commission planting. Two fast flowing 
{rivers,}the Erme and the Yealm run    
 from north to south. The block        
 contains the village of{Cornwood}and  
 the hamlet of{Harford.}There are also 
 scattered farms. Of the few{roads,}one
 is a B-road over 4m wide,the rest     
 being minor B-roads or tracks.        
  It is a peaceful,attractive area with
 a good selection of flora and fauna.  </content>
