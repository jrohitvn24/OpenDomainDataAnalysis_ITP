		<title>15Interview - HeadTeacher</title>
		<content> The Headteacher of the local Primary  
 School, Mr K Bunting has been teaching
 for 31 years, most of this time in    
 schools in Nottinghamshire. Mr Bunting
 was appointed to Misterton in 1969,   
 three years after this appointment the
 school celebrated its centenary. It   
 was a{'Board of Education'}school set 
 up in 1872, with a clock-tower which  
 also contained a bell.(This building  
 is still in use today as a{community  
{centre}).                             
 The school is now housed in what was a
 Secondary school, opened in 1957. The 
 school is unusual in that it has its  
 own covered heated swimming pool.     
 There are at present approximately 160
 children on roll.                     
 Mr Bunting enjoys his job very much,  
 finds the children delightful and     
 their parents very cooperative.
