 Just inside the boundary of the London
 Boro' of Havering is Havering atte    
 Bower from which the Borough gets its 
 name.Pupils from Forest Lodge have    
 studied this village and accounts of  
 these may be found in the text.       
                                       
 Bedford's Park in the S.E. corner of  
 our area has been of interest to the  
 Britisn Trust for Conservation and    
 volunteers have undertaken a programme
 of footpath maintenance,pond clearing 
 and tree planting.                    
                                       
 During 1984 Forest Lodge School was   
 involved in a tree planting scheme on 
 the edge of the school grounds.Despite
 the work of vandals rowan,sycamore and
 oak trees have survived.
