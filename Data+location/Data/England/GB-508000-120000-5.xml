		<content>  The heavy Wealden clay yields several
 building materials.  Winklestone, or  
 Sussex Marble, is found in the north. 
 In places the layer of Winklestone is 
 40 ft down, but at Old House Farm,    
 where there were quarries, it is      
 near the surface. As recently as 1960 
 blocks were dug up from Stonepits     
 Field, at the farm, and were fashioned
 into polished columns to support the  
 old winklestone altar slab of West    
 Chiltington Church.  This was found   
 below the 'new' altar, where it had   
 been buried during the Reformation.   
 Winklestone takes a fine polish and   
 was used for floors, tombs, fonts and 
 altars in many churches and houses in 
 the County.  An example can be seen in
 Saucelands, an old house near Coolham,
 which has a solid winklestone plinth. 
  This 'marble' is not used now, as the
 fossilised shells tend to drop out.   </content>
