		<title>09Little Ayton.</title>
		<content> Little Ayton is a small community     
 about a mile away from Great Ayton.   
 Known by quite a lot of people, who   
 pass by when going to{Rosberry Topping
 for walks. Little Ayton is much       
 smaller than neighbouring Great Ayton.
 Most people like Little Ayton for it  
 has lots of fresh air, nice long walks
 and the people are friendly.          
      The{Old Farmhouse}in Little      
 Ayton, stands next to the stables. The
 only thing that has changed on the Old
 Farmhouse is that the roof has had to 
 be repaired, and two new chimmneys    
 have had to be added.                 
    {Mrs Watson}(who lives in Little   
 Ayton) said "I like Little Ayton      
 because of the countryside and        
 because,everybody is so friendly".    
{Tom Barron}who also lives at Little   
 Ayton said "I have no intentions of   
 moving as I like it here very much."  </content>
