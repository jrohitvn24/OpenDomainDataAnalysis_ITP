		<content> In 1861 two shafts were sunk, they    
 drilled through soil, sand, boulders, 
 clay and water. Two shafts were needed
 for{ventilation}as air was drawn down 
 one and up the other. This was done by
 lighting a fire to draw the air down, 
 but by the early 1900s air pumps were 
 in use.                               
                                       
 The first miners used picks, shovels, 
 forks and explosives. They used to    
 crawl on hands and knees. The coal    
 was pulled along in tubs by pit       
 ponies in the early 1900s. In 1899    
 coal was supplied to the London North 
 Western Railway, which transported    
 30,00 tons of coal each year. The     
 line ( removed in the early 1980s )   
 was constructed in 1832 as part of the
{New Swannington Line,}by George       
 Stephenson.
