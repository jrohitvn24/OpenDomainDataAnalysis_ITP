		<title>08KERSEY</title>
		<content>  Kersey was the centre of the         
mediaeval wool trade,and gave its name 
to the woolen material known as Kersey 
cloth or "Kerseys".                    
  In the fourteenth century there were 
sheep everywhere around the village.   
  There was a rise in wool prices and  
beause the people produced far more    
wool than they needed,the extra fleeces
were sold abroad.                      
  The spinners and weavers of Kersey   
became very wealthy.                   
                                       
  Aldham Mill was once used as a water 
Mill.The water wheel was at the back   
and still is.   The river at the back  
is called the River Brett.
