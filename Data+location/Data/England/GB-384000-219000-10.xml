		<content>   THE AREA NORTH OF INNSWORTH IS LOW  
 LYING LEVEL LAND. THE SOIL VARIES FROM
 CLAY TO ALLUVIUM BEING IN THE VALLEY  
 OF THE RIVER SEVERN.                  
   OVER THE LAST 10 YEARS THERE HAS    
 BEEN AN AMALGAMATION OF FARMS, WITH   
 SPARE FARMHOUSES BECOMING AVAILABLE   
 FOR RESIDENTIAL USE. FARMS WHICH ONCE 
 HAD 60 COWS NOW HAVE 180. AUTOMATIC   
 ABREAST MILKING PARLOURS ARE USED.    
 THESE HOLD 10 COWS AT A TIME. DURING  
 THE SUMMER COWS ARE FED ON GRASS;     
 DURING THE WINTER ON SILAGE, HAY AND  
 CONCENTRATES.                         
   THE MILK YIELD PER COW HAS INCREASED
 BY 25%. THE YIELD OF GRASS PER ACRE   
 HAS INCREASED BY 25%, BUT THE NUMBER  
 OF COWS IS NOW BEING REDUCED BECAUSE  
 OF E.E.C. QUOTAS. SILAGE IS SELF FED  
 BY THE USE OF AN ELECTRIC FENCE. LAB- 
 OUR COSTS HAVE BEEN REDUCED BY 50% BE-
 CAUSE OF NEW EQUIPMENT AND MACHINERY. </content>
