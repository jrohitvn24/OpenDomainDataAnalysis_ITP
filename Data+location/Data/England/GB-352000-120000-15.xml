		<content>   I live in{High Street}next door to a
{grocery shop}called Eastons. I live in
 two houses with my Mum, Dad, Grandad, 
 brother and sister. High Street is a  
 friendly place of about{50}people.    
 Just along the road is a{chemist shop 
{owned by Mrs.Nielson. Her}assistant is
 my next door neighbour. At the end of 
 the road is the{market square,}a      
 grassy area with some lovely trees.   
 Two years ago my sister and some      
 other schoolchildren planted it with  
 flowers that the Town Trust bought.   
   When High Street was part of the    
 main{A303 road}it was a noisy and     
 dangerous place but when the{by-pass  
 was built it became a quieter         
{cul-de-sac.}I think peole liked       
 that!It was easy to cross the road    
 again, children could play more       
 safely and the houses were no longer  
 splashed with mud from all the lorries</content>
