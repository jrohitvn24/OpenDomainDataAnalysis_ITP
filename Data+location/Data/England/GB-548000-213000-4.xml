		<title>04Houses in Sawbridgeworth</title>
		<content> Many of the old houses in             
{Sawbridgeworth}have been knocked down.
 Some have survived, and there is a    
 mixture of buildings.An example of a  
 medieval house is the{Market House.  }
 It was lived in until recently but has
 now been made into a restaurant. This 
 has not changed the outside in any    
 way. Some Queen Anne houses were      
 destroyed to make a new road but many 
 Georgian houses are left.Many         
 Victorian houses are now shops,       
 changed inside but still with a rather
 dull brick aspect outside. There are  
 many pre second world war houses. In  
 the last 20 years many new houses,on  
 estates,have been built and people    
 from all over England have come to    
 Sawbridgeworth to live.These houses   
 are rather small,light inside and many
 are of open plan design.The mixture of
 styles makes Sawbridgeworth attractive</content>
