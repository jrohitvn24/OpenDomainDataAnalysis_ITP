		<title>18Home Life - a working farmer</title>
		<content>    My name is{Clive Stark,}I live in  
{Fritton}and I{own a small arable farm 
 of 95 acres. I rise at 6.30am, get    
 washed and dressed. I set the table   
 for breakfast and read the mail. I    
 start work at 7.30-45.{A typical day  
 would be to start muck carting by     
 transporting the manure from the      
 cattle-shed with a tractor and trailer
 to a heap near the field and later by 
 spreading it on the field. I stop for 
 coffee at 10.00  between muck carting 
 shifts. Have dinner at 12.15 and check
 weather on BBC television. Perhaps in 
 the afternoon I go and inspect my     
 crops taking my gun to shoot a few    
 pigeons. At 4.00 I have another       
 tea-break, then do two more loads of  
 manure. Teatime is at 6.00, usually   
 the end of my working day.
