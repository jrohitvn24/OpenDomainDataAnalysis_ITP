 The person who is hit has to say a    
 rhyme. Afterwards everybody runs away 
 and if the person touches them they   
 must stand with their legs apart until
 somebody frees them.If not,they're hit
  Some people play{Kiss Chase.}The     
 girls chase the boys. If caught, they 
 are kissed unwillingly.               
{ Forty-forty} is like hide and seek,  
 but when the person looks for you, you
 can 'save' yourself.                  
{ Un Deux Trois }is French.One person  
 stands in front of the rest and says, 
 "Un Deux Trois",and everyone does a   
 handstand.The last one to land back on
 the ground wins and takes the lead.

 from the others,giving istructions to 
 move.They must say "May I?"or they're
