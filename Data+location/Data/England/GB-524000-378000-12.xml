		<title>12A DAY IN MY LIFE:L.WOLD GIRL</title>
		<content>  In the morning I get up at about     
 8.00, get dressed and go downstairs to
 have breakfast.I often have shreddies.
 Then I walk to the taxi at the old    
 school.When we get to school we play  
 until it is time to go in.In the      
 morning before assembly,I often do    
 drawing.After assembly we do maths.We 
 then go out to play.After play we may 
 do S.R.A.or English work book.Then we 
 have lunch at 12.00.I have sandwiches 
 &amp; biscuits.Then it is break time.     
 When we come in,we read;then we some- 
 times do P.E. or projects.At 2.30 we  
 have play time.After play we do more  
 work,and at 3.15 we go home.          
  I usually go riding when I get       
 back.My pony is called Fonty.he is a  
 grey,three quarters Welsh and a       
 quarter Arab.After tea,I watch T.V.   
 until bedtime at about 9.00.
