		<content> The housing in the Dawlish area is    
 very varied, thathed cottages dating  
 from I535 A.D. Many new estates built 
 by large firms. Council housing,      
 subsidised by the local council. Some 
 very large privately owned homes,     
 among them Ashcombe Towers and        
 Luscombe Castle.Within the last few   
 years there are several elderly       
 peoples flat complexes with a care    
 warden in attendance. There are very  
 rarely any empty houses, as they are  
 bought up quickly again. No slums at  
 all in this area.
