		<content> Some of the houses in Pennington      
 Square are over a hundred years old.Up
 to the 1960's the New Forest ponies   
 used to wander freely around the      
 village.They caused a football match  
 to be stopped on the school field as  
 they stampeded past the young         
 footballers.After much protesting and 
 many photographs the school campus was
 fenced off and cattle grids built into
 many of the forest roads.             
 the old village infants school still  
 stands.It was a photographer's        
 studio,then it became a cafe which    
 caught fire.Now it is a workshop.The  
 old junior school is a furniture      
 restoring factory.                    
 Where the village fish and chip shop  
 and fishmongers now stand used to be  
 the site of Priestlands Farm on whose 
 land the present Infant,Junior and    
 Comprehensive Schools have been built.</content>
