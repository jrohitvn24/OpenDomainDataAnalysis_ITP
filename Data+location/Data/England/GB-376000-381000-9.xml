		<content>{BEEF PRODUCTION.}                     
 On steeper fields around Mobberley    
 where farmers are unable to grow      
 either crops or grass for conservation
 there are permanent pastures suitable 
 for semi-intensive beef production    
 where the dairy &amp; beef animals are put
 to grass during the summer months and 
 fed cereals and silage in-house during
 the winter.                           
{FARMS-CHANGE OF USE.}                 
 Many of the farms in this area are    
 tenanted from the Tatton Estate,      
 others have been purchased by         
 commuters who wish to live in the     
 country but have no interest in       
 farming. Most of the farms in this    
 area fall into the second category and
 are owned  by families whose income is
 derived from other industries than    
 farming and many of them keep horses.
