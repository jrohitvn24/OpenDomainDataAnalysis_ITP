		<title>11Coombs Dale.</title>
		<content> A typical Derbyshire Dale, leading    
 south from the main road from Calver  
 to Stoney Middleton, then bending     
 west. The steep sides are grassy, with
 limestone bluffs, and sheep and cattle
 graze it, but there is no drinkable   
 water and stone troughsand dewponds   
 have been constructed for them.       
 An old quarry was used as a council   
 tip but this has now been grassed over
 and restored and is a SSSI. Another   
 SSSI is on Rough Side, the steep slope
 on the northern bank of the Dale      
 nearer Black Harry.                   
 Mining has always been carried out in 
 Coombs Dale and various footpaths     
 cross it and climb its sides. The Lily
 of the Valley grows wild here, with   
 the Purple Orchid and Blackthorn.
