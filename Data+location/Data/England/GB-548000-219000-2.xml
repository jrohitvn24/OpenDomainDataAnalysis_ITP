 In the Firs there are a lot of trees. 
 There are silver birches and pine     
 trees and horse-chestnuts and larches.
 There are windy weeds, grass, lovely  
 flowers, stinging nettles and mud.    
 There is a lot of chirping from the   
 birds. The wind rustles in the trees. 
 There is a stoney path going through  
 the Firs. Some of the cow parsley is a
 s tall as my teacher. The Firs smells 
 of dry leaves. It is called the Firs  
 because there are so many Fir trees   
 there.
