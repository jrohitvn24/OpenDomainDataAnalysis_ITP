		<title>04LIFE IN SILK WILLOUGHBY</title>
		<content>{Silk Willoughby}is a very small       
 village two miles south of{Sleaford.  
 It has a church, vicar and            
 vicarage and there is also a village  
 hall and a public house. Although     
 the village is small there is a great 
 community spirit. The hall is used    
 for fortnightly whist drives, local   
 wedding receptions and a playgroup.   
 Villagers find employment on farms, at
 the{Bass Maltings}in{Sleaford}and at  
{RAF College Cranwell. Electricity}was 
 installed in 1939 and{street lighting 
 in 1946. In the 1950s the village     
 attracted new housing. A{sewage system
 and{water pipes}were installed in the 
 l960's. Although the population has   
 expanded the amenities are fewer. The 
 bus service runs only twice weekly,   
 businesses have disappeared and the   
 school closed in 1970. A car is now   
 essential to travel to work.          </content>
