		<title>05CIDER MAKING</title>
		<content> The best{cider}is made from bitter    
 sweet apples. Apples are grown with   
 the help of the bees that polinate the
 blossom. When the apples are ripe they
 are picked and put in a bowl shaped   
 container with a conveyor belt which  
 takes them up to the mill to be       
{crushed.}Then they are called{pulp.}It
 is then wrapped in nylon cloth with   
 wooden slatted racks on top and       
 another cloth on top and so on. When  
 there are 14 to 16 layers the{cheese  
 as it is now called is put into a     
 press and all the juice is squeezed   
 out. It goes into an underground tank 
 that holds about 1000 gallons of      
 juice. Then it is pumped into wooden  
 casks to ferment. The yeast turns the 
 sugar into alcohol. Then the cider is 
 filtered and put into jars. Then it is
 sold. It can be dry or sweet. Dry     
 cider can be called{"scrumpy".        </content>
