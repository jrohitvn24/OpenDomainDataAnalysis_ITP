 To be a Catholic we believe that Jesus
 Christ suffered and died on the cross 
 for us arose again on the third day   
 after his death. We believe he was the
 son of God; creator of the world. We  
 go to church to celebrate this by     
 singing hymns and eating bread and    
 drinking wine - the body and blood of 
 Our Lord. We follow this religion and 
 spread the good news that God is alive
 in our hearts. When Christ was alive, 
 Gods son, he performed many miracles  
 and we hear of these in the readings  
 of the mass.We also want to live a    
 Catholic life during our time on earth
 so we go to confession and ask for    
 forgiveness of our sins.              
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
