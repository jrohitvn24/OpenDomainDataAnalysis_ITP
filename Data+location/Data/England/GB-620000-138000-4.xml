 formed on 11-1-1986 by the            
 amalgamation of Britain Aeronautical  
 Museum,Brenzett,and Kent Battle of    
 Britain Museum,Hawkinge,with the aim  
 of bringing into use as a museum,the  
 historic grounds and building of part 
 of the former RAF Battle of Britain   
 Fighter Station at Hawkinge near      
 Folkestone,Kent.Both museums have been
 open continuously to the public for   
 the past 10 years. They had developed 
 and expanded upon similar lines,with a
 common aim to keep alive the spirit of
 the Nation that stood alone in the    
 time of war, by compiling the day to  
 day events of 1940 from a variety of  
 sources and with the help of eye      
 witnesses and historians.
