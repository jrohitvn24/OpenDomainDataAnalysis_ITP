		<title>02THE RIVER TARRANT</title>
		<content> ON WEDNESDAY 19TH JUNE SOME OF US     
 WALKED UP OF THE RIVER TARRANT.WE     
 STARTED JUST SOUTH OF TARRANT RAWSTON 
 FARM OPPOSITE ADDISON COTTAGES AND    
 WALKED NORTH TO LUTON FARM. AT FIRST  
 THE RIVER WAS 60 CM DEEP.IT WAS 12    
 CM DEEP AT LUTON FARM.THE BED OF THE  
 RIVER WAS STONEY  AND THE BANK WAS    
 ABOUT 1 METRE HIGH. THERE WERE A LOT  
 OF WATER PLANTS EXCEPT IN THE PARTS   
 WHERE THE CATTLE HAD BEEN GRAZING.WE  
 WENT PAST OR UNDER THE ROAD BRIDGE AT 
 TARRANT RAWSTON.IT WAS DARK AND LOW   
 DOWN. THERE WERE TWO SECTIONS AND     
 THE WALLS WERE SLIMEY AND SLIPPERY.   
 THE WATER WAS VERY SHALLOW. AT TARRANT
 RAWSTON FARM THERE WAS A SMALL WEIR.  
 AT THE SIDE OF THE WEIR,IN A SMALL    
 BRICK HUT, THERE WAS AN UNDERSHOOT    
 WATER WHEEL.THIS PUMPS WATER UP TO THE
 FARM FOR USE IN THE DAIRY.
