		<content>    {Necton Baptist church}celebrated  
 its Bicentenial in 1985.In 1785 a Mr. 
 and Mrs Bunn were given permission to 
 build a Baptist Church as there were  
 nine Baptists who worshipped together 
 in the area, and in 1834 Necton was   
 one of the first 21 churches to join  
 the East Norfolk Baptist Association. 
 The first recognised paster in 1804   
 was Rev. John Carter.  During this    
 time an adult school was started and  
 lessons in reading, arithmetic and    
 writing for children.                 
     The building is rather square and 
 built of brick which has now been     
 rendered with concrete.  Inside is the
 chapel with a pulpit and organ, and a 
 gallery runs around three sides of the
 chapel.                               
     There are 11 members of the church
 and services are held weekly with     
 Communion and Bible Study monthly.    </content>
