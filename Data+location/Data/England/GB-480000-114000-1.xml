		<content> Attractive, unspoiled, peaceful       
 countryside with valleys, mainly open 
 farmland, running NW to SE, their     
 sides, mostly wooded, rising to ridges
 of the South downs.  Th Petersfield to
 Chichester road bisects the area and  
 narrow lanes lead to the hamlets of   
 East Marden, North marden and         
 chilgrove.  The land supports mixed   
 farming and forestry.  Historically   
 interesting are the churches (12/13)  
 of East &amp; North Marden, the thatched  
 wellhead at East Marden, two tumuli   
 and the remains of a medieval village 
 and chapel.  Local hostelries are the 
 royal Oak, a traditional "pub" and the
 White Horse, now more restraunt than  
 pub, with wines of international      
 repute.  Local fauna include fallow   
 and row deer, grey squirrels, rabbits,
 hares, foxes, badgers, pheasant,      
 partrige and owls.                    </content>
