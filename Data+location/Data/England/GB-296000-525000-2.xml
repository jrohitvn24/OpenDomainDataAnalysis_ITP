		<title>02DERWENT HOWE WORKINGTON</title>
		<content> This is an{industrial developement    
{scheme}in Workington started by the   
 Mossbay Enterprise Trust{(MOBET)}.This
 scheme was established because of the 
{decline in steelmaking}in the local   
 area leaving large areas of unused    
 land and{high unemployment.           
     There are several industrial      
 projects in Cumbria comparable in size
 to the{Derwent Howe scheme}at         
 Workington but as far as reclamation  
 of the land is concerned this is the  
 largest.                              
     We interviewed the project manager
 to find out more about the scheme.He  
 told us that the project had been     
 planned in January '82 but it really  
{began in April '82.                   
     There are 4 main areas to the     
 site:The Lakes site,the Riverside     
 site,the Derwent site and Howe        
 Michael.                              </content>
