 1232 by Peter des Roches,Bishop of    
 Winchester.The abbey originally had   
 thirty rooms and fourteen             
 Premonstatensian monks living in      
 them.The abbey's land used to take up 
 most of Hampshire and the land used to
 join on to other abbey's lands in the 
 area.The abbey is owned at the moment 
 by English Heritage,and has had       
 four curators before Mr.Evans, the    
 current curator.The abbey gets most   
 visitors on nice days and on bank     
 holidays.It was dismantled by the Lord
 of Southampton and made into a Tudor  
 mansion.There are eleven bodies buried
 between the two wells. One is  Abbot  
 Issac and another abbot Richard.The   
 abbey cost Â£32 pounds to be built and 
 was built by the monks that lived     
 there.
