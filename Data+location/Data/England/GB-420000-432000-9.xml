		<content>    Pudsey's industries are located in 
     {a)}18th and 19th century stone   
 mills spread over the built-up areas  
 and beside streams which were the     
 original power source.                
     {b)}purpose-built units on an     
 industrial estate situated between    
 major road and rail links.            
    Few old mills serve their original 
 purpose.Some have moved over to       
 man-made fibres whilst others have    
 been converted into smaller units,    
 e.g.small warehouses,a printer's      
 shop,a plumber's suppliers.In the main
 the modern units house distribution   
 sites for national companies or small 
 firms concerned with home improvement.
 Several metal-based industries        
 concentrate on specialist items,e.g.  
 park fencing and castings.Regrettably 
 many units, both old and new,display  
 the all-too-familiar{TO LET}signs.    </content>
