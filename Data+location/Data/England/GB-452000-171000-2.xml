		<title>02LANDSCAPE IN FRILSHAM</title>
		<content> The land is{undulating.}There are fine
 far reaching views because of the     
 varying heights of the land and       
 variety of cover. Most fields are     
 under 30 acres and enclosed by hedges.
 Low ground-71metres-is in the valley  
 of the{River Pang}in the centre of the
 area rising to 121m at Coombe Wood and
 Frilsham Common, the site of an       
 ancient beacon. Hawkridge and Coombe  
 Wood in the north are natural         
 woodlands as are those round Boars    
 Hole Farm and Home Farm. High Copse   
 and Birch Farm Woods in the north are 
 commercial plantations. In the centre 
 lies the village of Frilsham. A small 
 patch of heath is registered as a     
 village green round which are grouped 
 the houses. In the countryside around 
 are 7 farms with all their            
 outbuildings. One of 4 large manor    
 type houses,Marlston; is now a school.</content>
