		<content> The main shopping centre was south of 
 the railway line.The Library wasn't   
 there then because it was a recreation
 ground.Grinstead Lane didn't have a   
 bridge then so the main link road from
 north to south was south street.Kings 
 Road then used to be called farmers   
 lane.Lancing used to be a holiday     
 resort.Brooklands Boating lake used to
 be a rubbish tip.French planes used to
 blow up the doodlebugs landed where   
 what now is Whitestyles.The coast road
 didn't have very many houses along it.
