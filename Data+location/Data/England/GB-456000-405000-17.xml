		<title>17THE MINERS' STRIKE</title>
		<content>  One man was killed because of the    
 strike.A bunch of striking miners     
 threw a brick through his brothers    
 window.This made the brother mad so he
 went outside telling his brother to   
 stay indoors.Taking no notice he      
 followed his brother out.Five minutes 
 later the two brothers were still     
 fighting with the miners.One brother  
 was badly beaten up but the other was 
 worse.he was taken into hospital and  
 lapsed into a coma.A few weeks later  
 he died.This was tragic for his family
 and friends.The men were charged with 
 manslaughter and even his brother was 
 charged with a criminal act.This      
 caused a lot of aggravation.          
   Some time later the striking miners 
 had a meeting and decided to go back  
 to work.                              
                                       
                                       </content>
