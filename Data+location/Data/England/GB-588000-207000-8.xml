		<title>08FARMING IN THE AREA</title>
		<content> In the Goldhanger area the most       
 common crops are wheat, barley, sugar 
 beet and oil seed rape. But the one   
 which is grown most often is wheat.   
 One farmer,named Mr Bunting of        
 Highams farm, told us that years ago  
 the Tiptree and Goldhanger area were  
 the best places for growing crops     
 because it is very good soil.But now  
 it is not so good. There is a farm    
 called Nursery farm and that has got a
 house with a garden and a big farm    
 round the back.                       
      Some farms grow soft fruit like  
 strawberries, rasberries, goosberries,
 mulberries and tomatoes. Some farms   
 also grow vegetables like turnips,    
 potatoes, peas and cabbages. Most of  
 the fruit and vegetables are for pick 
 your own.
