		<title>13PUBLIC HOUSES</title>
		<content>      There are three{public houses}   
 which are all sited along the main{   
{A3057.}From south to north they are   
 The Duke's Head, The Malthouse and    
 The Bear and Ragged Staff Inn.        
      The two latter pubs, as well as  
 providing food and drink, contribute a
 great deal to the lives of those      
 living in the villages of Timsbury and
 Michelmersh.                          
      The Malthouse, for example, holds
 events such as fetes, barbecues and   
 the ever familiar car-boot sales,     
 during which money is raised for      
 various deserving causes and          
 individuals in the area. A racing     
 track for miniature, radio-controlled 
 cars is being laid in the orchard.    
      The Bear and Ragged Staff hold   
 similar events to help the handicapped
 children of Romsey and is the venue   
 for the Pumpkin Club.                 </content>
