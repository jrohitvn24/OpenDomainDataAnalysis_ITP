		<content>    The agricultural land near the town
 can be described as 'good',with high  
 land values resulting.                
    The climate is one of the best in  
 the U.K. for mixed farming with low   
 rainfall, low frost risk and high     
 sunshine figures giving a long growing
 season. The soils are mainly developed
 from Chalk hence are light and dry, if
 rather flinty. There are patches of   
 heavy clay soil, and in the valley    
 floors there are alluvial soils. The  
 relief is gently rolling.             
    The land cover is dominated by     
 arable crops, barley and wheat, with  
 large fields resulting from the       
 demands of mechanised farming. Most   
 farms, however, have a mixed basis,   
 with dairy herds of Friesian cows.    
 Some Charolais beef cattle are raised.
 There are intensive pig and poultry   
 units attached to several farms.      </content>
