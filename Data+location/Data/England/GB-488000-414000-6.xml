		<content> The ecology of Normanby Hall Country  
 Park is one of the responsibilities of
 Scunthorpe Museum.They provide a      
 Countryside Interpretive Service for  
 visitors to the Park and the          
 surrounding countryside.The aim of the
 service is to help visitors gain      
 maximum enjoyment from the Park and   
 its surroundings and to encourage a   
 greater understanding and             
 appreciation of nature,wildlife and   
 the countryside. The Countryside      
 Interpretive Officer hopes to achieve 
 these aims by explaining what there is
 to see and where to find it.Guided    
 walks for the general public have been
 introduced and there are self guided  
 nature trails.There are staff to give 
 information and service.
