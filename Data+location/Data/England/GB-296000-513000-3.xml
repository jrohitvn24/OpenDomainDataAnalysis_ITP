		<content> Most of this area consisted of pasture
 or grassland belonging to High Low    
 Hall Farm although Summer Grove       
 pumping station and the West          
 Cumberland Hospital appeared in the   
 corners of this square.               
 Summer Grove pumping station pumps    
 water from Ennerdale Lake to areas of 
 Whitehaven and was built in 1952 to   
 cope with increasing demand from      
 industry,especially Marchon.The water 
 is pumped by 17-130hp generators to   
 areas higher than Summer Grove.Standby
 generators are available in case of   
 power cuts.                           
 Nearby Summer Grove house is being    
 used as a hostel for nearby Sellafield
 workers.Previously Summer Grove was a 
 mansion with its own gardens and      
 drive.A lodge(which still has a coat  
 of arms above the door)stands at the  
 entrance.                             </content>
