		<title>08TRANSPORT IN STAMBOURNE</title>
		<content>  The Hedingham Omnibus Company runs   
 single decker buses which serve the   
 village as follows (return journeys): 
 to London;Monday,Wednesday,Friday:    
 to Halstead;Tuesday:to Braintree;     
 Wednesday:to Haverhill;Friday.        
  School buses take children to primary
 and secondary schools, and taxis bring
 in children from outlying areas to    
 catch these buses in the village.     
  For longer journeys, long-distance   
 coaches can be boarded on the A604 at 
 Gt. Yeldham. The nearest British Rail 
 stations are at Braintree (14 miles) &amp;
 Audley End (15 miles).                
  It is very difficult to make journeys
 by public transport, and most people  
 rely on private cars: non-car owners  
 often get lifts with friends and      
 children have to be ferried by their  
 parents. There are no organised car-  
 sharing schemes, only informal ones.  </content>
