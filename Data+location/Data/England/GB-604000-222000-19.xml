		<title>19BETH CHATTO GARDENS</title>
		<content>   On Monday 1st July we went to find  
 out about Elmstead Market and Beth    
 Chatto Gardens. Before the 1960s there
 was no house or garden on the site    
 which was part of the fruit farm owned
 by Mr. Chatto. In 1976, the year of   
 the great drought, this piece of land 
 was waste, covered with scrubby       
 bushes, mostly brambles with poor thin
 grass. So huge tools were brought in, 
 and a thick layer of clay up to three 
 feet deep in places. It was a most    
 attractive place with water too. They 
 had all different types of beds. There
 was a very colourful flower which has 
 the sun reflecting all colours. Its   
 true colour was white. They have giant
 rhubarb. If you touch the rhubarb and 
 then lick your finger it will make you
 ill because the rhubarb is poisonous. 
 There are lots of different flowers   
 from rhubarb to chrysanthemums. Katie </content>
