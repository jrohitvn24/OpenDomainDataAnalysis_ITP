		<content>  Collectively,  farms   in  the   area
 continue to provide the largest number
 of  full  &amp;  part-time  jobs  for  the
 village.  Most of this  part-time work
 is domestic,gardening &amp; seasonal (e.g.
 potato harvest)   but even this latter
 work   is   disappearing   with   more
 mechanisation. The next highest number
 of  jobs  are  provided  by  the Civil
 Service  &amp;  Military   at    Catterick
 Garrison.      The shop provides self-
 employment and  some  part-time  jobs.
  A  fair  number  of others are  self-
 employed  and  include   three   small
 family  haulage businesses , a nursery
 &amp; landscaping business,   two   family
 building  firms,  a  Civil engineering
 firm, a  horticultural engineer  and a
 small  market garden  enterprise.  By 
 far  the  greater proportion of people
 have to  travel to the  towns to work.
  Unemployment is on the increase.     </content>
