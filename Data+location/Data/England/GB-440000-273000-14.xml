		<title>14HOME LIFE IN WOLSTON 1.</title>
		<content> Although new families make up much of 
 Wolston population, many generations  
 of familiar names still exist,        
 sometimes{four generations}living as  
 neighbours. However,{one parent       
{families}are on the increase and this 
 is reflected in the number of mothers 
 who go out to work. Most families own 
 a car and use it at weekends to visit 
 friends, go shopping, attend the      
 Speedway or other sporting activities,
 visit local places of interest such as
 Museums, Combe Abbey Park, and take   
 the family on holiday once or twice a 
 year. Many families spend a good deal 
 of their spare time in{watching       
{television}but more and more children 
 have home computers and use these for 
 entertainment. On warm evenings,      
 families often go to the local public 
 house, to the delight of the children!
