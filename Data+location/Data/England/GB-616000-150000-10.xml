		<title>10FARMING - CROPS</title>
		<content> Farming in this area is largely arable
 with crops of wheat, barley and oil-  
 seed rape. Often a small acreage of   
 potatoes is grown. Fodder crops       
 include lucerne and grass, for hay and
 silage, for feeding stock in adjacent 
 areas. Sheep are the principle grazing
 animals. Apple orchards produce fruit 
 for market and for juice extraction.  
 Soft fruits are grown, especially for 
 the Pick-your-own trade. There is a   
 self-pick farm at Pett Bottom and the 
 popularity of direct selling has also 
 encouraged the growing of a wide range
 of vegetables. These trends have been 
 important to the small farmer, who has
 found it necessary to diversify in    
 order to survive. Those with 100 acres
 or less cannot be commercially viable 
 without augmenting their income; one  
 farmer operates a school mini-bus,    
 whilst another offers Bed &amp; Breakfast.</content>
