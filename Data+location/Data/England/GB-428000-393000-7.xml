		<content> Much of the old village  housing in   
{Oughtibridge}has disappeared being    
 replaced by new brick buildings,in    
 addition, two large estates have been 
 built, mainly semi-detached and       
 detached.These houses are all         
 privately owned.A few council built   
 houses and old people's flats exist.  
 All the new houses and council houses 
 have gardens which are well tended.   
 Most of the old stone houses have been
 renovated ond supplied with modern    
 amenities.                            
{Wharncliffe Side}is a much smaller    
 village than Oughtibridge and the     
 housing is a mixture of old and       
 new,private and council. There are a  
 few scattered farms and cottages away 
 from both village centres,all are     
 privately owned.
