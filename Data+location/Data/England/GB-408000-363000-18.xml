		<content>     The main events at Longnor Races  
are the horse races.                   
                                       
     There are many classes of races   
including trotters which are horses    
that pull sulkies which are a kind of  
cart.  There are betting stalls around 
the track so that you can bet on the   
races.                                 
                                       
     Other competitions for horses and 
ponies include The Best Turned Out,    
The Mad Gallop and Gymkhana events,    
all of which children can enter.       
                                       
     Towards the end of the day there  
are motorbike races.  These are after  
the horse races as they tend to cut up 
the race track.  There is also a five  
mile running race for those people who 
want to join in.                       
                                       </content>
