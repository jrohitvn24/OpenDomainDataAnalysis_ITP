		<title>11Farming Around Holmfirth</title>
		<content> On the farm, near where I live, work  
 starts at 6.30a.m. each morning. The  
 farm covers 60 acres of land and      
 supports 55{milk cows.}It takes two   
 men  to look after the farm though    
 sometimes a few more are brought in at
 week-ends.Milking starts at 7.00a.m.  
 and finishes about 8.30a.m.During the 
 summer months the cows are taken back 
 into the fields after milking but in  
 the winter they are kept inside.The   
 cows are milked again at 4.00p.m.     
 Machines are used to milk the cows.   
 Each cow can yield up to 6 gallons of 
 milk a day.The farmer bottles the milk
 and takes it around in his Landrover. 
 Each year a number of calves are      
 reared and these are taken to the     
{market}in Holmfirth to be sold.       
 Replacement cattle are bought for the 
 dairy herd whilst the{beef stock}is   
 bred from a Charolais bull.           </content>
