		<content>    In our survey we interviewed       
 seventy -five people and all of them  
 had been to school.Most people went to
 secondary school and primary school,  
 and some people went to junior school 
 and infant school separately.Only one 
 person went to a middle school. Most  
 people wore school uniform.           
    The most popular age for starting  
 school was at five,and only two people
 started at six.The majority finished  
 school at fifteen.Only one finished   
 school at twelve.This was an old      
 person.A lot of people didn't have    
 further education, but twenty-six     
 people did.                           
    Most liked school but eight people 
 didn't like it ever.
