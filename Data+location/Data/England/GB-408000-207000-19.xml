		<title>19WINSON CHURCH</title>
		<content> The church of St.Michael and All      
 Angels dates from early Norman times  
 and has always been joined to Bibury  
 as a chapelry. It stands on the       
 highest point of the village, in open 
 and peaceful countryside. It is a     
 simple church with neither tower nor  
 spire and has several unusual ancient 
 features. On the North side the Norman
 doorway has been blocked, and on this 
 side is the one remaining original    
 window, in the chancel, its head      
 carved from a single stone. On        
 entering the church the most striking 
 feature is the chancel arch whose     
 jambs lean outwards. On the shafts of 
 the porch can be seen several votive  
 crosses crudely carved and initialled 
 or dated. There are two services a    
 month, a Holy Communion Service and a 
 Morning Prayer, attended by a small,  
 faithful congregation.                </content>
