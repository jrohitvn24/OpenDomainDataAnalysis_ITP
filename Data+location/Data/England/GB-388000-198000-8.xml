		<title>08CHERINGTON - CHILDREN'S FOOD</title>
		<content> In the area 54 children aged 5 to 11  
 responded to questions of diet as     
 follows: 7 out of 8 normally had an   
 uncooked breakfast, only a small      
 minority indulged in bacon and eggs.  
 19 never ate out at a restaurant; 20  
 did on average once a month and l5    
 more often.  Packed lunches were eaten
 by 31 of the sample, 22 had the school
 cooked meal provided and only one     
 returned home at midday. We thought we
 would like to find out which families 
 enjoyed a bottle of wine with a meal: 
 14 said their parents often had wine, 
 31 said sometimes and 9 never. Finally
 we investigated children's            
 sweet-eating habits: 14 admitted that 
 they were allowed sweets every day, 32
 said once a week, 8 said hardly ever, 
 and no child complained of being      
 totally denied.                       
                                       </content>
