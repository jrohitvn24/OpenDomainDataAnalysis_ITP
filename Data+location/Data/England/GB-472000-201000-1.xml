		<title>01A General View:Chinnor etc.</title>
		<content>   Our block is predominately rural    
 in character. It contains a section of
 a vastly expanded village-Chinnor.    
 This village lies at the foot of the  
 Chilterns; a possible reason for its  
 growth being cheap and available land 
 for developers during the 1960s.      
   In contrast to this, there are two  
 much smaller villages nearby-Sydenham 
 and Emmington-and also much open      
 cultivated land comprising eleven     
 farms etc. The B4445 road linking     
 Chinnor with Thame runs diagonally    
 N.W.-S.E. across the block.           
   The two small villages, Sydenham by 
 far the larger, depend very much on   
 Chinnor for their everyday needs. Both
 are within 2km. of Chinnor though     
 private transport is a necessity. The 
 market town of Thame lies about 4km in
 the opposite direction from Chinnor.
