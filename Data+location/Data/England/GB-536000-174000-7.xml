		<content>  I got up at 0853.I washed,dressed &amp;  
woke my sister,Zoe,aged 9.I asked her  
to help carry boxes of books from the  
car.They were my grandma's:she didn't  
want them.For a half hour we sorted the
books.Zoe had her breakfast &amp; I cleared
kitchen.I read "The Great Piratical Ru-
mbustification" &amp; "The Librarian &amp; The 
Robbers" by M.Mahy.At 1030,I woke Mum. 
She sent me to buy the"Sunday Times" &amp; 
the "OBSERVER".I read the "S.Times Ma- 
gazine" in my room.Mum told me to phone
Aunt Jane to ask if we could drop in   
for morning coffee.She invited us for  
lunch.We gladly accepted.Before lunch  
we played cricket.After a delicious lu-
nch of pork,potatoes &amp; beans we built a
cubby in the apple tree.At 1415 the fa-
mily watched Wimbledon Men's final &amp;   
booed &amp; cheered together.After collect-
ing Zoe from a party I saw Becker win. 
We left at 1800.I went to bed at 2030. </content>
