 Soccer and cricket have replaced the  
 pit as the chief concern in the       
 village. A fiercely proud old codger  
 stated that a job at the pit depended 
 on a man's ability on the sports      
 field. It was in fact rumoured that   
 the soccer committee, with N.C.B.     
 connections, would go to great lengths
 to import good players from nearby    
 areas. The village turns out in force 
 to support their teams, winter and    
 summer each Sunday afternoon.
