		<title>08The Conservation Centre</title>
		<content>   We went to Newton St. Loe and       
 interviewed Mr.Dave Adams of the      
 British Trust for Conservation        
 volunteers which is a registered      
 charity which combines people, tools  
 and equipment.                        
   The Newton centre is the H.Q. for   
 the whole of the west of England.     
 Mr.Dave Adams showed us all round the 
 building and grounds.  He showed us   
 the offices, kitchens, showers and    
 dormatories where people stay. We     
 tried some of the wild strawberries   
 from the conservation area and found  
 them rather bitter.                   
   He showed us the tool shed which    
 contained 200-300 tools which cost    
 Â£4-5000. The conservation volunteers  
 plant trees, manage woodland put up   
 stiles and keep footpaths clear and   
 repair dry stone walls and other      
 things like that.                     </content>
