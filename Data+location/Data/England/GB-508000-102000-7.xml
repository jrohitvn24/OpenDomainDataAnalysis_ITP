		<title>07WEST DURRINGTON ESTATE</title>
		<content>     The Draft Plan for W.Durrington   
 prepared by Worthing Borough Council  
 in 1980 comments "Worthing is already 
 a densely developed town and has major
 constraints on further developments ..
 There is however one remaining part of
 the town where there is still         
 considerable scope ... this is in the 
 northwest at Durrington ... identified
 as being suitable."                   
     This estate is reported to be the 
 fastest growing development along the 
 south coast.  800 acres are earmarked 
 and it is planned to build 1350       
 dwelling units eventually.  When      
 complete the estate will house 10,000 
 people.                               
     A POPULAR PLACE TO LIVE           
     Our survey showed that while 35%  
 of the residents had previoulsy lived 
 in Worthing the other 65% had moved   
 from all over the UK and from beyond. </content>
