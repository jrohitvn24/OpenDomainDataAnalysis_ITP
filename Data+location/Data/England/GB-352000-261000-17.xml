		<content> Erin James was born in a Hereford     
 hospital and wore an identity bracelet
 on her wrist so she wouldn't get      
 muddled up with other babies.Six      
 hours after she was born,Hannah,Nia &amp; 
 her father fetched Erin and her mother
 from hospital and took them home by   
 car.                                  
    Her mother brought her to school   
 when she was two weeks old.We helped  
 bath her using baby bath bubbles      
 instead of soap as soap would make    
 Erin too slippery to hold.After she'd 
 been dried and powdered we helped     
 dress her in a disposable nappy and   
 baby-gro and took turns to cuddle her.
    Now that Erin is three months old  
 she has baby rice to eat and enjoys   
 sugar-free drinks,a herbal drink made 
 from fennel and a drink of rose hip &amp; 
 hibiscus.She is now trying to sit up  
 in her baby bouncer.                  </content>
