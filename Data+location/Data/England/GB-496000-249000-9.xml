		<content> The village gives the appearance of a 
 typical English village and has a     
 variety of building types.Parts of    
 farm houses are wattle and daub (Wick 
 End and North End) and at Bury End,   
 Burdelys Manor has a 17th century     
 panelled room.Some thatch remains     
 (although much was lost in past fires)
 such as Wayside Cottage-8 Bedford Rd  
 (mid-19th century). Many estate       
 cottages were built of limestone with 
 diamond-framed windows in mid-19th    
 century for the Trevors of Bromham,   
 such as 2,4,12,32, Bedford Rd, Manor  
 cottage and Village Farm.The Crown    
 built standard Crown cottages e.g. 1,3
 16,18, Bedford Rd and Dropshort Farm. 
 The Crown crest and "V.R."can still be
 seen on many.Some semi-detached and   
 bungalows were built along the Bedford
 Rd in 1920's and some detached in '30s
 and only infill since 1945.           </content>
