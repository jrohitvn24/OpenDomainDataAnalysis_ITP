		<title>03Bromley Development Plans</title>
		<content>The first of many plans for developing 
Bromley town centre was proposed in    
the 1950s. None were implemented, but  
the new M25 motorway, which will be    
completed in 1986, will have a large   
effect on Bromley, making more people  
and businesses want to come to Bromley,
so a new plan has been proposed.       
                                       
By making it easier for people to      
travel into central Bromley, the       
Borough Council hope that any new      
development will be in the town centre,
and not in the surrounding areas.      
                                       
At the moment, about 6% of Bromley's   
working age population is unemployed.  
Bromley Council hopes to provide       
opportunities for new shops and        
business to create more jobs. A plan   
for a new shopping centre should also  
help with this.                        </content>
