		<title>11R.A.F. COSFORD</title>
		<content> The main provisions in this section   
 R.A.F. Cosford are the sporting       
 facilities,the housing for the airmen,
 officers and the old hospital.The air 
 men live in the married quarters for  
 three years.The houses are mostly     
 modern brick semi detached houses     
 with a tiled roof.The officers' houses
 are separated from the airmen's       
 quarters by the A41. The officers'    
 houses have larger gardens and more   
 rooms.                                
  A short while ago the most important 
 feature was the hospital which was    
 built in 1940 and opened by the       
 Duchess of Gloucester. A year later   
 a Burns Centre was added. The Burns   
 Centre was very important in the 2nd  
 World war because of all the people   
 who were burnt in crashes. The        
 hospital was knocked down in 1977.
