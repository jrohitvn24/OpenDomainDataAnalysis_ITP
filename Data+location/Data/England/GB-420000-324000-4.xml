		<title>04MAYPOLE DANCING</title>
		<content>One of the customs still carried on in 
the area is the Maypole dancing at the 
infants school.I was once a May Queen  
attendant.We wore white dresses which  
had red trimming around the bottom and 
a red sash around my waist.I can       
remember going up to the Junior school 
with my maypole in the rain.My maypole 
was the frame of an old umbrella with  
bright coloured tissue paper streamers 
and flowers on top of the frame to     
cover the strips of metal wire.It also 
had a red shiny handle.The pole had a  
clip which kept slipping and the frame 
kept falling.The May Queen wore a long 
white dress,a red velvet cloak and     
carried a bouquet of flowers.This      
custom is carried on at the beginning  
of May every year at Castle Park school
and at Anslow school.
