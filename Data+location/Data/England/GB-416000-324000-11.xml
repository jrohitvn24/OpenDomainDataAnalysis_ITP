		<content>{Anslow Church,}built in 1861 by Oswald
 Mosley, together with school and      
 vicarage next to it, is distant from  
 the village of Anslow.  It shares a   
{vicar}with Rolleston church.  There   
 are{services}7 months of the year in  
 church, but in winter it is closed and
 the Mission Room in the village is    
 used.  There is no longer a choir, but
{funerals and weddings}can take place. 
 The church benefits financially from  
 the{Sophia Mosley Trust,}and employs a
 cleaner and gardener.  There is a     
 thriving{Sunday school and youth club,
 both held in the Mission Room.        
                                       
{Bell House Farm and Lane}take their   
 name from when a bell was rung to call
 in the workers from Needwood Forest.

 today who were mentioned in the{first
