		<content> The number of shops found in the area 
 is very small.{Stanford Dingley}boasts
 a small{Post Office}and an{antique    
{shop.}The majority of the people go to
 a nearby{hypermarket}for bulk buying. 
 Local towns include{Reading}and       
{Newbury.}These are both approximately 
 10 miles away from Stanford Dingley.  
 There are some small villages which   
 provide the essential goods for this  
 area, which are slightly closer. Many 
 people grow their on vegetables in    
 large gardens but this is only        
 possible in the summer. A private     
 source of transport is therefore a    
 bonus in this kind of area.
