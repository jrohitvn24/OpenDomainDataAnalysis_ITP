		<title>04THE TOWN QUAY</title>
		<content>    This is to the west of the abbey   
 ruins. It is on the River Roding,     
 upriver from Barking Creek. Barking   
 used to be an important fishing town. 
 The fishing boats used to unload at   
 the quay. One of the best known       
 fishing fleets was the {Short Blue    
{Fleet}which was owned by the {Hewitt  
{family.}It was once the largest in the
 world. The quay was also used         
 commercially and there is still an old
 warehouse next to the bridge over the 
 river. The whole area is now derelict,
 though the basin is sometimes used by 
 canoe clubs.
