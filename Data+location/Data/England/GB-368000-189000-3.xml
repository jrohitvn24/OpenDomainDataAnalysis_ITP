		<title>03Mrs. Kimber Remembers (cont)</title>
		<content> Mrs. Kimber remembers how things were 
 in the old days. Water was taken from 
 a well. Once she knocked a man's hat  
 into the well by accident. If the     
 bucket fell in they used somthing     
 called a dogrod to fish it out. The   
 village then had three shops and a tea
 garden. There was an old tree by the  
 crossroads that came down because it  
 was hollow. The war memorial was moved
 to the church when the road was       
 widened. The villagers respected the  
 Earl who lived in the manor by the    
 lake. He gave food to the sick, and   
 when the children heard his horse and 
 cart going to the shop, they knew     
 there would be sweets for them. There 
 used to be a gypsy camp-site in the   
 village. The caravans were painted    
 brightly. Travellers passed through   
 the village and begged for food.
