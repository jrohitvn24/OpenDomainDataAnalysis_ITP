		<content>{CHILDREN OVER FIVE}Girls play a more  
 complicated version of Hide and Seek  
 called Om-Pom 1-2-3.In this you have  
 to try and get home before the person 
 who is up sees you;if he sees you he  
 will then run to home which is a pole 
 and says Om-Pom 1-2-3 out.Some girls  
 in the Summer just lie on the school  
 field and talk to each other.Others   
 also lie on the field and watch       
 football.                             
{BOYS}play football and chase.In chase 
 one boy is up and has to chase the    
 other boys.If he catches another boy, 
 the boy he catches is now up.Also they
 play skipping with the girls if they  
 want to.In this two people hold one   
 end each.They turn it and one person  
 has to jump in and skip until you stop
 the rope.If you do this then you hold 
 one end.The next person to stop it    
 holds the other end.                  </content>
