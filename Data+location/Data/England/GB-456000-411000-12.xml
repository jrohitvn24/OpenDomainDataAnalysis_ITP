		<title>12       LUXURY ITEMS</title>
		<content> I interviewed 93 people and asked     
 them which luxury items they possesed.
 The most common item was the stereo   
 record player with a total of 57. The 
 thing that was least popular was the  
 dish washer with a total of 12. This  
 is the order that they came in,       
 stereo               57 people        
 tumble dryer         42 people        
 video recorder       38 people        
 computer             32 people        
 micro wave cooker    30 people        
 food mixer           27 people        
 coffee maker         24 people        
 special telephone    14 people        
 new car              14 people        
 dish washer          12 people        
 Luxury items are expensive, often     
 electrical goods, which people buy for
 pleasure rather than need.            
                                       
                                       </content>
