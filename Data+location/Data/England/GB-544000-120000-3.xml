		<content>    The replies showed that about      
 two-thirds of our parents have lived  
 here for ten years or more. Only three
 were born here.                       
    Eight people had moved here from a 
 city(7 from London);16 had come from  
 towns;8 from villages and 4 from      
 totally rural areas.About half of the 
 people had moved here for housing     
 reasons and a quarter to seek or      
 follow work.Also,half of the people   
 are content with the area and three   
 quarters think that their life style  
 has improved since coming here.       
    However, half of the people        
 questioned feel that the local        
 amenities are inadequate;shops and    
 social opportunities being significant
 areas of discontent.                  
    We, the children of the estate     
 would like more play areas and shops.
