		<content>Computers are used on larger farms for 
day-to-day running e.g. wages,         
accounts, crop records, date of seed   
planting, chemicals applied, seed      
treatment required, date of harvesting,
returns per acre, where and when sold, 
price received. Owners of computers    
belong to a Syndicate of Agronomists   
with a link to the National Union of   
Farmers. Small farms have access to a  
computer but in the main keep records  
by hand. With the advent of machinery  
on arable land, cultivation is no      
longer labour intensive. For example,  
on 3000 acres 20 full time workers are 
supplemented by 6 part timers at har-  
vest. Crops are generally sprayed at   
ground level but occasionally by air.  
Aerial spraying is by contract labour.
