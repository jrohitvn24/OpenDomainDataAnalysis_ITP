 public transport with both bus and    
 rail stations.

 Line. One of the largest uses of this 
 station is for people commuting to    
 work especially into{Derby.}The Bus   
 services,largely{National Trent}link  
 Belper with other large towns and the 
 smaller villages in the area.         
 Milford is on the{A6}and is serviced  
 by a public bus service for           
 inhabitants wishing to travel North or

 on private transport.
