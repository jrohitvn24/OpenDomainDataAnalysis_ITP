		<content> There are quite a lot of clubs in     
 Holcombe Rogus.Recently a Hand bell   
 club has started at the church and 12 
 of us go to this on a Saturday        
 morning.This is most interesting.A    
 Youth Club meets at the Village Hall  
 once a fortnight and most of us go to 
 this.We have started a Cricket team   
 recently.There is a Womens'Institute  
 which meets at the Village Hall once a
 month,and a club called the Evergreens
 which is for retired people in the    
 village.They have meetings and also   
 trips during the summer months. A few 
 of us go to Clubs in Wellington,      
 where we go to gymnastics or swimming.
 One or two go to Hemyock for Scouts   
 and Guides.
