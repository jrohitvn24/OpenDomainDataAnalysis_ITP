		<content> Most of the shops at the top of the   
 High Street cover the essential needs 
 of the  local people. There is a      
 chemist, launderette, video shop,     
 florist and fish and chip shop. There 
 is also a delicatessen which sells    
 unusual cheeses and breads, eggs and  
 milk, all at relatively high prices.  
 They sell home-made sandwiches and    
 have a large variety of wines. There  
 are Thai, Chinese and Italian         
 restaurants. The area has a large     
 number of estate agents.              
                                       
 In the White Lane area there are no   
 shops, but there is a poultry farm. In
 Shalford there is a sweet shop and in 
 Chilworth there is a newsagent,       
 butcher, garage and a public house    
 called the Percy Arms. Bitter is the  
 most popular drink and lunches are    
 also very popular.                    </content>
