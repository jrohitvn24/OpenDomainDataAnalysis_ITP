West Haddon is not very well equipped  
with amenities.There are approximately 
one tenth of the amenities listed in   
the Domesday Project. It has one       
primary school,two small food shops,   
two public houses, one playing field,  
one small hotel and one village hall.  
Most people go to Daventry, Rugby or   
Northampton for their amenities.       
A few travel to Coventry.              
Some of West Haddon's amenities are    
used by outsiders, these are the       
chapel,antique shop,hair dressers,     
school,public house and hotel.An       
important village amenity is the       
village hall which is used by people   
from all over Northamptonshire. The    
main things it is used for are school  
dinners,play school,barn dances,bingo, 
play sceme,jumble sales,parties,O.A.P
