		<content> The pumps can raise two hundred tons  
 of  water per minute and the height   
 from the drain to the river is twenty 
 feet.In the summer the water in the   
 drainage channels is used to irrigate 
 the crops and is fed onto the farmland
 from siphons and covets.One engineer  
 and ten men look after this area      
 .Farmers pay drainage rates of six to 
 ten pounds an acre per year to the    
 Drainage Board and they must buy a    
 licence fee to irrigate their land. A 
 Quality Officer is responisble for    
 checking pollution and fining farmers 
 who allow chemicals to leak into the  
 water.A Duty Officer mans a telephone 
 for twenty_four hours in case of      
 emergencies.The Drainage Board is     
 responsible for the maintenance and   
 repair of the banks of the rivers and 
 dams;they also cut the grass on the   
 banks and remove weed growth.         </content>
