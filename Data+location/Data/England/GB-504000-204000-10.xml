		<title>10GRAND UNION CANAL,AN AMENITY</title>
		<content> Although the Canal halped  bring      
 prosperity to Hemel, it is not much   
 used now for carrying goods but it is 
 used for boating holidays and moorings
 and people like to see the locks being
 used. One of the most popular hobbies 
 is fishing. Many anglers spend the day
 relaxing on the banks. Although their 
 lead weights can poison wildfowl and  
 line and hooks harm wildlife, they    
 need clean water for the fish. The    
 canal is not badly polluted as        
 freshwater shrimps and occasional     
 trout show that oxygen is present.    
 Algae on top suggest that some        
 pollution occurs. Possibly as         
 phosphates from detergents and        
 nitrates from farmland. The towpath is
 a favourite place to walk safe from   
 the traffic and its fumes and small   
 cildren fish for sticklebacks with    
 nets and jamjars.                     </content>
