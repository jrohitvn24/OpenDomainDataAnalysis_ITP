		<content> Lambourn is famous for racing,but 40  
 years ago it wasn't so famous.There   
 used to be only 12 stables but now    
 there are 22.The railway was closed as
 it was losing money.It had been very  
 popular and the horses were carried to
 the big races on the train.It was     
 opened in 1899 and it was closed on   
 January 2nd.1960.Many places were     
 called'Chipping.....',so Lambourn was 
 originally called 'Chipping           
 Lambourne'.40 years ago the shops were
 very small and they  would only sell  
 their own goods.A man called John     
 Carter tried to burn down the village 
 on 3 occasions,but he was caught and  
 hung.He was the last person to be     
 hung.His tombstone is in the          
 churchyard.In 1930 the present school 
 in Greenways was started,but the      
 Infants were at their own school in   
 Close End.                            </content>
