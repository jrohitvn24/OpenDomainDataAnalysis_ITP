		<title>01Tourism/Ecology near Newquay</title>
		<content> The area which we are describing is   
 criss-crossed by numerous narrow      
 country roads which are kept in good  
 condition because people are coming to
 live in the countryside and converting
 old barns and farmhouses.They come    
 here to live because of the peace and 
 to be in reach of the beaches which   
 are a couple of miles away in Newquay,
 now a very popular holiday resort.    
   This peace is occasionally shattered
 by Nimrod reconnaissance aircraft from
 nearby R.A.F. St. Mawgan.             
   The hedgerows are well looked after,
 carefully trimmed back, not just      
 hacked down with grass-cutters. Some  
 of the flowers that grow here are     
 honey-suckle, cow-parsley, elderflower
 and fox-gloves.There is a little      
 arable and pastoral farming but the   
 land is undulating and the area       
 exposed to strong winds.              </content>
