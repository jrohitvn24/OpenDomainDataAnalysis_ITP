		<title>05The Mayor</title>
		<content>    1985 finds Mr. Clifford Reeks in   
 the second year of acting as Lydney's 
 mayor. He wears the silver-gilt chain 
 of office, presented by local         
 benefactor John Watts in 1967, with   
 great pride and enjoys his many and   
 varied duties.                        
    Born in the neighbouring village of
 Aylburton, he has spent almost all of 
 his life in the area. He first became 
 a councillor in 1973.                 
    Unlike some big city counterparts  
 he has to combine the office with a   
 full time job which often presents    
 difficulties. As well as council      
 committees his attendance is often    
 sought at frequent local events, civic
 occasions and local hospital visits.  
    He particularly enjoys attending   
 youth centred events and confesses to 
 being sometimes lost for words when   
 asked to speak.                       </content>
