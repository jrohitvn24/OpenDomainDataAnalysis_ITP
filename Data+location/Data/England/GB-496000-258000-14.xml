		<title>14Gamekeeping In Odell Woods</title>
		<content>   Tony Read is Lord Luke's gamekeeper,
 on the Odell Estate which covers 3,000
 acres(800 acres of woodland).  Up to  
 last year Mr Read collected the       
 pheasant eggs and sent them away to be
 hatched.  Now he buys in 4,000 day old
 pheasants which he rears in pens.  At 
 7 weeks old the birds are released    
 into the woods.  This ensures that    
 there will be enough sport for Lord   
 Luke and his guests.  There are       
 'shoots' on the estate for 11 days    
 during the season - October to        
 January.  Part of Mr Read's job is to 
 destroy the vermin which will either  
 attack the pheasants,or destroy the   
 trees.  Magpies,crows,stoats,weasels  
 and hedgehogs (which suck the eggs)   
 are more of a problem than poachers!  
 Mr Read works from dawn to dusk, 7    
 days a week, and holidays in winter   
 when the shooting season ends.        </content>
