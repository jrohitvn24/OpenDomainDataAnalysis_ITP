The block is to the N.E. of Preston.   
The S.W. corner of the block takes in  
a very small area of the Brookfield    
estate which is mainly council housing.
Just outside Preston, on the east side 
of the road to Grimsargh(which is in   
theN.E. corner of the block) is the Red
Scar industrial estate. This is on the 
site of the old Courtaulds factory. On 
the West side of the road is the Rough 
Hey Industrial estate. Part of the Red 
Scar site is given over to a           
Crematorium. A disused railway runs    
through the area and at one time used  
to serve Courtaulds.The M6 motorway    
runs through the area. Most of the land
is devoted to farming - the western    
part mainly for hay making and the     
eastern part for grazing for dairy     
cattle. Part of the area is wooded     
Grimsargh is in the N.E. corner.       </content>
