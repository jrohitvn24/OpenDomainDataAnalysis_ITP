		<title>08GUY FAWKES' NIGHT AT DUFTON</title>
		<content> The thing about the Youth Club is that
 it has members in so many families.So 
 when they have a Bonfire Night,we're  
 all there.Dufton is on a hill,&amp; the   
 bonfire is made down on the site of a 
 former mill below the village.A steep 
 bank backs it,&amp; across the road       
 another hill looks huge in the night. 
 It is cold &amp; we crowd in to keep warm 
 at first,but soon have to back away or
 stand on the road,for the heat.Home   
 made toffee,provided by several Mums, 
 is handed round.We all bring a few    
 fireworks &amp; these are set on the fence
 posts on the roadside &amp; lit one after 
 the other.The bigger boys have rocket 
 launchings at the top of the hill     
 opposite,&amp; you see the torches flicker
 up there amid much laughter &amp; shout-  
 ing.Some of the boys are men now,     
 you realise.
