		<content> IN WINTERSLOW FOR AT LEAST A HUNDRED  
 YEARS THERE HAS BEEN A YEARLY EVENT.  
 THIS WAS NORMALLY A CARNIVAL OR A BIG 
 BRING AND BUY SALE.IT WAS HELD IN THE 
 SCHOOL HALL,OR IN THE RECREATION      
 GROUND ACROSS THE ROAD FROM THE       
 SCHOOL.THIS STOPPED ABOUT 19 YEARS    
 AGO.                                  
    SOON THEY DECIDED THAT THEY NEEDED 
 A CARNIVAL OF SOME SORT SO THEY PUT   
 BOTH THE CARNIVAL AND BRING AND BUY   
 TOGETHER. THEY MADE IT INTO A MAY     
 FAIR.                                 
    AT THE MAY FAIR THEY HAVE LOTS     
 OF FUN AND GAMES. THE SCHOOL CHOOSES  
 A MAY QUEEN FROM THE TOP CLASS.THIS   
 YEAR IT WAS TRACY WOOLLEY.THE MAY     
 FAIR NORMALLY HAS 8 TO 10 FLOATS.     
 ALSO LOTS OF WALKERS.THE MAY FAIR     
 IS ALSO A GREAT SUCCESS.              
                                       
                                       </content>
