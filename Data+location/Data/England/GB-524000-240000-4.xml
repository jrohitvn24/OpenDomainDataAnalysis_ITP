		<title>04A TYPICAL SCHOOL DAY</title>
		<content> amused! After Assembly we did some    
 maths until break. At playtime we had 
 relay race practise. We have a village
 schools sports coming up soon. After  
 play we did some creative writing     
 until 12pm. I usually have dinner with
 the infants because I serve them their
 food. Today I couldn't, more relay    
 practise! Dinner was tasty but I      
 didn't fancy the egg custard. After   
 lunch I practised the glockenspiel    
 parts for a special concert we are    
 having with a local secondary school. 
 When I got back there was only time   
 for my teacher to read a bit of our   
 story before home time. My friend     
 keeps a note of the 'coach people' so 
 we are sure the children in the       
 villages catch the coach home. When   
 she gets back we all go home. No      
 Country Dancing Club so home to tea!
