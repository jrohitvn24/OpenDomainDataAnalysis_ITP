		<title>11GUY FAWKES NIGHT IN OTTERY</title>
		<content> 'Open Classes'.                       
 The procession is headed by effigy of 
 Guy Fawkes and by the Carnival Queen  
 and Princess'tableau. Brass Bands     
 accompany the procession through the  
 town.                                 
 At 8pm a huge bonfire is lit by the   
 River Otter and Guy Fawkes is burned. 
     A few days before the carnival a  
 fair arrives in the town and stays for
 approximately a week, people enjoy the
 dodgems, helter skelter, roundabouts  
 and other amusements.                 
 During the evening the mens and ladies
 tar barrels are rolled or rather      
 carried through the crowded           
 streets. About a dozen men dressed    
 in old clothes and wearing large thick
 padded gloves made from sacking meet  
 at each pub in turn carrying the      
 flaming barrel on shoulders until it  
 disintegrates.                        </content>
