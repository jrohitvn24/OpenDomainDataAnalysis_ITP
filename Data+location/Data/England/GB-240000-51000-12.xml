{ Employment.}                         
 A survey of the employment of parents 
 of 100 children in Millbrook School.  
    There are no large factories       
 locally to employ people,so 22% are   
 self employed and 4% are unemployed.  
 32% work in the Dockyard,20% serve in 
 the Royal Navy and the Fleet Auxillary
 Millbrook and St. John are commuter   
 villages for Plymouth.A few people are
 needed to work in the local shops and 
 on the farms and market gardens.Most  
 of the people who do work locally are 
 women in part-time jobs in shops,pubs,
 holiday camps,Maker Camp or school    
 kitchen staff and dinner supervisors. 
 A high proportion of Naval staff and  
 Dockyard workers live in St.John      
 because it is nearer to the training  
 establishment of H.M.S.Raleigh and    
 Devonport Dockyard in Plymouth.       </content>
