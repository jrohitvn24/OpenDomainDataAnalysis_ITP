		<content>   This  beck  rises  near  Eppleby and
 flows  East  through   Carlton  to  be
 joined by the Mary Wild Beck before it
 passes  through  Aldbrough.  One  mile
 further on the stream becomes known as
 the   Clow Beck   by  which  name  it 
 continues  to be known  until it flows
 into the  River Tees  near  Croft some
 seven meandering miles further on.    
                                       
   The beck contains fresh water trout,
 bullheads, minnows and sticklebacks or
 rather it did,  until a few months ago
 when  it  became  polluted  by  silage
 effluent  from  one  of the  bordering
 farms near  Carlton.  The Northumbrian
 Water  Authority   who  control  water
 courses in this area did not prosecute
 the offender but are to require him to
 restock  the  beck  with   appropriate
 species of fish in the near future.
