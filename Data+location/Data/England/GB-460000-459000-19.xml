		<title>19Strensall - Local History</title>
		<content> The village of Strensall existed      
 before the{Norman Conquest,}but no    
 church was mentioned in the{Domesday  
{Survey}as it was probably built       
 between 1100 and 1150 A.D.  In 1886   
{Strensall Common}was purchased by the 
 Government.  By 1804 Strensall was on 
 the{Foss Canal}to Sheriff Hutton. The 
 Ship Inn is near the old Strensall    
 Landing. {Strensall Feast}used to be  
 held there.  Early{industries}included
 two potteries (about 1840 onwards) and
 a tannery (before 1870) which still   
 operates.  Farming, the railway and   
 domestic service occupied most people 
 in the 1851 census.{Robert Wilkinson, 
 a batchelor farmer, endowed three     
 charities on his death in 1718.  These
 still operate.  The school and the    
 road opposite bear his name. {Old     
{names}were Strenshale, Stranessale,   
 Strencile, Strencham, Trencham.       </content>
