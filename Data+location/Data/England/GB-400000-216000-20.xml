		<title>20General Conclusion</title>
		<content>    In conclusion I would like to thank
 all the children of Upper Sixth and   
 Form Six for their help in the        
 Domesday Survey. To Mr. Rooker for the
 photographs, the Evans family for our 
 visit to Northfield Farm, the Vicar   
 for showing us around St. Oswald's    
 Church, Shipton, to the owner of the  
 Forgmill Hotel for his cooperation and
 Mrs. Unwin and the children involved  
 in the computer inputting.            
    Today the village of Shipton       
 continues to grow in size. No longer  
 is the village self-supporting as it  
 was in the 1920'S when the villagers  
 lived and worked locally, mainly on   
 the land. Nowadays with the           
 mechanisation of farming and          
 increasing industrialisation the      
 people of Shipton seek their          
 livelihoods in the near by towns and  
 cities.                               </content>
