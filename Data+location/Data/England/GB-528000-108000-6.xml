		<content>  In the Doomsday Book, the village of 
 Pathcham was recorded under the name  
 of Piceamor Pacceham Amor _ a small   
 place to love.There were only 26      
 houses in the village!                
{ALL SAINTS' CHURCH}:A Church stood    
 here before 1086; much of the present 
 building dates from the early 12th    
 century.The Nave and Chancel are      
 Norman.The 'Doom' painting over the   
 arch is probably late 12th Century and
 was uncovered in 1883 under 30 coats  
 of whitewash.In the Churchyard the    
 oldest tomb is that of Mary Gunn      
 (1694).A famous smuggler,Daniel       
 Skayles is buried by the North wall.He
 was shot in 1796 nearby.              
{TITHE BARN _}this long barn is said   
 to be the longest in Sussex.It is on  
 the North side of the Church.
