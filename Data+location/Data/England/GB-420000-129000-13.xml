		<title>13A FARLEY CHILD'S DAY CONT'D</title>
		<content> Some of the hymns we sing are, "All   
 things bright and beautiful," "Morning
 has broken" and more. After assembly  
 we go back to our classrooms to do    
 science until twenty to eleven and    
 then we have break until eleven.      
 After break we do maths until lunch   
 which is at mid-day. We finish lunch  
 at half past twelve and have break    
 until one o'clock. Then we have sport 
 until two o'clock. After that we      
 normally read or do English. At twenty
 to three we listen to a radio         
 programme. From quarter to three to   
 three we often recite our tables. At  
 three o'clock school finishes, but    
 some of us do gym club and then we go 
 home.                                 
 When I get home I play with my        
 friends and have tea at six o'clock.  
 I play or watch television until bed  
 time about half past nine.            </content>
