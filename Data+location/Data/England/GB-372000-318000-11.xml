		<content> This{Ecology}project was started in   
 January 1984 and is named after the   
 area in which it's found, Norbroom    
 Marsh.It was set up to make a safe    
 living place for{wildlife,}and, plant 
 life.Already there are about 300      
 trees.Most of these trees were given  
 by local schools,Councils and the     
 public.The work was carried out by    
 voleutees.Some of the money was       
 donated by the Wrekcin District       
 Council,and the Newport Council.All   
 of the trees and paths cost about     
 Â£415.Miss Mc'Clean is the founder     
 member and is in charge of the        
 project.The area was a rubbish tip    
 since 1665 till the late 1970's,      
 Norbroom Marsh has some rare birds and
 one of them is the redshank.This is   
 rare because it normally nests on     
 rocky cliffs at the seaside.
