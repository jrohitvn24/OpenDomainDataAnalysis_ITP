		<title>02ABOUT WANBOROUGH</title>
		<content> y. on the historical side mention must
 also be made of the monastery in lower
 reigions, surround by a moat and      
 served by a busy mill . consequently, 
 we have a network of paths and tracks 
 used by the mules and pack-hores      
 leading to the mill,which is now a dry
 heap of rubble because of a Thames    
 Waterboard diversion of the River     
 Cole.                                 
 The village is in two parts,upper and 
 lower,with a steep hillside full of   
 springs between them.At the top is the
 church which boasts a tower and a     
 spire dating from the 15th-16th C.For 
 years Wanborough was a self supporting
 community with lots of rural          
 crafts,now its character is completely
 changed,building development and      
 communications have taken people out  
 of the village to work.It is still a  
 lively village to live in!            </content>
