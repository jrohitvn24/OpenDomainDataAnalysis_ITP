		<title>05THE VILLAGE HALL</title>
		<content>   Seely Hall was named after the{Seely
{family}from Lincolnshire who purchesed
 most of the village of Brook in 1859. 
   The hall was built in 1949 and was  
 used as a{library}for a short period  
 of time. Now the hall is used for     
 occasional community get-togethers    
 such as{flower arranging classes}for  
 the locals. The hall is open all day  
 and every day and in the month of{    
{August}there is a nature exhibition   
 called{"LOCAL LOOK"}that is on display
 at the hall.The hall may look small   
 but is the focal point of Brook. The  
 hall is situated  opposite the{village
{green}and resembles a small house at  
 first sight.
