		<title>11THE RIVER CHESS.</title>
		<content> Since the Middle Ages the River Chess 
 has had significant use in the economy
 of the area.                          
 The Medieval Water Meadows,which were 
 flooded to provide a level surface as 
 well as improving the soil have been  
 documented. This link with the past is
 maintained today,as the Chess is still
 worked in an agricultural sense,as can
 be seen from the water cress beds.    
 The Chess has become rneowned for its 
 unspoilt nature,allowing the growth of
 all forms of aquatic life.            
 Trout,escaped from the Chess Valley   
 Trout Farm also have made the Chess   
 their home.This has also led to the   
 increased use of the river for        
 recreational purposes such as fishing.
