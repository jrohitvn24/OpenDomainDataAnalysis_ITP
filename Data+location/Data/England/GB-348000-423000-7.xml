 and a waiting list. As the village    
 grew, another Institute was formed and
 called{Longton Marsh.}Both groups use 
 the same hall but work as separate    
 units run by separate committees.     
     Variety shows are a speciallity of
{Longton Institute}which entertains the
 old people of the village at a free   
 Christmas party with tea and a present
 for everyone. The group has appeared  
 at national events and won several    
 awards including a first at Scene 80. 
     Each week between 50 and 80 ladies
 attend the meetings which are arranged
 on a rota basis by members from small 
 areas of Longton and Hutton.          
    A{weekly market}for home produced  
 goods moved from Leyland this year and
 is very popular. All craft, produce or
 jams are strictly quality controlled  
 before they are allowed on sale.      </content>
