 HELD AT MUSGRAVE EVERY YEAR.LONG AGO  
 GIRLS WOULD DANCE FROM BROUGH CARRYING
 FLOWERS TO ST.THEOBOLDS CHURCH AT     
 MUSGRAVE.THE BOYS WOULD COLLECT FRESH 
 RUSHES AND THEY WOULD BE LAID ON      
 RUSHBEARING DAY.THE FLOOR OF THE      
 CHURCH WOULD BE EARTH AND THE NEW     
 RUSHES.GIRLS MAKE THEIR CROWNS WITH   
 LOTS OF FLOWERS AND THE BOYS MAKE     
 THEIR CROSSES WITH RUSHES.THE CROWNS  
 AND CROSSES STAY IN THE CHURCH UNTIL  
 THE NEXT YEAR.                        
                                       
 FROM THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY UNTIL     
 RECENTLY THE RUSHBEARING WAS ON MAY   
 DAY FROM TEN A.M TILL FOUR P.M.BUT NOW

 THERE ARE TWELVE YOUNG MAIDENS FROM   
 THE BROUGH AREA. THIS IS BECAUSE THERE
