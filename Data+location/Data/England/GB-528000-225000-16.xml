		<content> The Parish Council now have little    
 power &amp; act mainly as channels of     
 communication with larger authorities.
 They can however have an effect on the
 local environment in terms of the     
 upkeep of footpaths, streetlighting,  
 hedge cutting, vandalism, bus time-   
 tables, sewers &amp; flooding. In certain 
 circumstances, the Parish Council can 
 be highly effective, eg in organising 
 the planting of 120 trees to replace  
 dead elms. There is no gas in the     
 area, but other services come from a  
 variety of sources - education &amp; roads
 from Herts CC; police, planning &amp;     
 refuse collection from E Herts DC;    
 water from Lee Valley Authority;      
 electricity from Eastern Electricity  
 in Ipswich &amp; telephones from Bedford. 
 Most people do not seem dissatisfied  
 over adequacy of services &amp; mobile    
 library particularly appreciated.     </content>
