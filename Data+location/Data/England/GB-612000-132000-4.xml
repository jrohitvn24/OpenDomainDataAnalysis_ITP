		<title>04Mayday Celebrations</title>
		<content>    It was Friday afternoon and time   
 to start the May celebrations. First  
 it was the country dancers. There are 
 no boys in the group, only girls. Next
 was the Bike Derby; our teacher set   
 out a course for the boys to go round 
 on their bikes and whoever had the    
 best time got a prize. Then the       
 maypole dancers were on; there are 24 
 girls but only 12 ribbons so we took  
 it in turns. The infants skipped      
 around the maypole in pairs which they
 made a right mess of; one lost his    
 shoe and sat down in the middle of the
 circle to put it back on and a great  
 queue built up waiting for him. Then  
 when our head teacher told them to    
 stop they kept going and she had to   
 round them up. The mayqueen was then  
 crowned. Everyone voted for a girl to 
 be queen. The mayqueen was given a    
 present and everyone had their picnic.</content>
