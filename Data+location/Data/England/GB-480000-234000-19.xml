		<content> I think it is good to have more shops 
 and houses because I am not allowed to
 go in the village to shop or to any of
 my friends who live nearby. I would   
 love to though. I am going to a new   
 school in September so I will make new
 friends and when I get older I will be
 able to bike to Two Mile Ashor in the 
 village. In a few years time, when the
 houses are built up the hill, I will  
 be able to go up the hill and play if 
 there are any children there.
