		<content> Northwold parish comprises Northwold  
 ward and Whittington ward,the two     
 villages being approximately 2 miles  
 apart.The Northwold Parish Council is 
 composed of 11 Parish Councillors from
 both wards,3 District Councillors and 
 one County Councillor.The Parish      
 Council,which holds regular meetings  
 in the village hall on the first      
 Tuesday of each month,is responsible  
 for many aspects of village life for  
 example adequate street lighting,the  
 recording of burials and the          
 maintenance of the burial grounds.It  
 will also consider and comment upon   
 planning applications for buildings   
 within the village,but approval can   
 only be granted by the Borough Council
 at Kings Lynn.It also ensures that the
 various footpaths are kept in a proper
 state,although the Borough Council is 
 responsible for any clearance needed. </content>
