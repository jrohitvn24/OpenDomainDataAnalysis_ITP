		<title>03Workers' Welfare, Bournville</title>
		<content>When{George Cadbury}moved his factory  
from the city centre he was{motivated} 
not only by his need for a larger      
factory site but also{concern for his  
workers.}In 1879 he built the factory  
and{143 houses} which were the nucleus 
of Bournville, which has continued to  
grow. In 1898 33{Alms Houses}were built
for retired workers.  {Recreational    
facilities}next to the factory include 
a concert hall, swimming pool, cricket 
and football pitches, tennis courts as 
well as clubhouse for indoor pursuits. 
Within the factory complex a{shop}sells
company products to workers at below   
retail prices. Employees have always   
been encouraged to improve their       
position within the Company and to aid 
this,{training courses}are provided to 
develop management skills at all       
levels. These are held at{The Beeches  
Management Training College}nearby.    </content>
