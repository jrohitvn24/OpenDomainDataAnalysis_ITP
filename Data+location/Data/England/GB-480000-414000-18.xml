		<title>18Luddington Church</title>
		<content> The present church dedicated to the   
 patron Saint Oswald was built in 1845 
 although churches had been built on   
 the site previously,one as early as   
 1300.                                 
  The church is built on a rise outside
 the village as it was built to serve  
 both Luddington and Garthorpe.It is in
 a traditional cruciform style  with   
 some stained glass windows.           
  It contains some "free"pews dating   
 back to when people paid for their    
 pews to show their standing(or not) in
 the village.                          
  A Sunday School is held each week    
 with ten regular attenders,only one a 
 boy!                                  
  There is 1 service a week at the     
 church with times varying according to
 a set programme as Luddington is now  
 part of the "North Axholme Group"which
 includes 3 other villages.            </content>
