		<content> THE NEW A.45 BY_PASS.                 
                                       
 The new road is a by_pass,started     
 about two years ago,which takes the   
 A.45 Northampton road to the north of 
 Rushden and will eventually by_pass   
 Higham Ferrers and Stanwick.The road  
 has cost millions of pounds and the   
 machines used have included           
 bulldozers,diggers,heavy              
 rollers,dumpers and tarring           
 equipment.Before building,the land was
 covered with crops and was part of    
 Ditchford Lane.The road is a dual     
 carriageway and has involved the      
 construction of a new bridge over the 
 main railway line,as well as two new  
 roundabouts.The old road still serves 
 to get to a farm.
