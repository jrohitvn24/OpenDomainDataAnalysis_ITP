		<content> Each year in Combe Martin on the 3rd  
 of August Carnival week starts. It is 
 a week that everyone enjoys well most 
 people. Some people dress up and go in
 a wheelbarrow race from the top pub   
 which is the London Inn down to the   
 bottom pub which is the Dolphin       
 inn.They have to stop at every pub and
 drink a pint of beer some people just 
 tip it down them. And some  people on 
 the next night do a raft race,one for 
 children and one for adults and after 
 the raft race there is a disco. At    
 Hollands Park there is a Donkey Derby 
 for children and the best night of all
 is the carnival procession people     
 dress up  some as clowns some go on   
 floats.                               
  It is a really exciting week.
