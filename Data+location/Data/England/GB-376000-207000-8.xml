		<content> In recent years there has been a lot  
 of building in Whitminster. there are 
 33 houses left in Whitminster which   
 were built before the war. Two of     
 these date from the Middle Ages and   
 are of similar design.                
                                       
 Yewtree Cottage is one of the medieval
 cottages. It used to be thatched with 
 wooden supports but it hs been        
 modernised.                           
                                       
 Along School Lane there are 24 houses 
 built after 1945. They are all large  
 houses built to individual plans and  
 standing in large areas of land.      
                                       
 There are four small estates built on 
 the outskirts of Whitminster. These   
 are small modern houses designed for  
 first time buyers or young families.
