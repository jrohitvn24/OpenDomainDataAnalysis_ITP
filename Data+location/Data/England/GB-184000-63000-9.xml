		<content>  St Mawgan playgroup is for children  
 who are 2\ to 4\ years old. About 20  
 children go to St Josephs Hall on     
 Monday, Wednesday and Friday mornings,
 from 9.15 to 11.45am. Mrs Adams the   
 organiser has three lady helpers .    
 The children use a sandpit, wendy     
 house, rocking horse, slide,          
 trampoline, reading, painting, books, 
 card games, puzzles, balls, hoops,    
 Lego for models and clay. They can    
 cook buns and biscuits and walk to    
 Polgreen, through Carnanton Woods or  
 to the playing field.The children all 
 seemed very happy. Eight mums help    
 raise funds by coffee mornings which  
 normally raise Â£20,an egg stall which 
 raises Â£17. Recently they had a knit- 
 in, all the sponsor money went to the 
 playgroup and the knitting to the     
 Ethiopian appeal. The money bought new
 tables and a Duplo train.             </content>
