		<content> Most of the parish of Marston         
 Moretaine is low -lying,below 200     
 feet.The overlying soil is Oxford Clay
 with occasional alluvium.The area is  
 Grade 3 agricultural land,much of     
 which has been lost to clay workings. 
 In the area currently being farmed it 
 is predominantly an arable area       
 growing winter wheat, winter barley   
 and rape.Some pastoral areas remain   
 for sheep and cattle such as Moat     
 Farm, Marston which is a mixed farm,  
 arable with sheep and around 180 head 
 of Beef cattle which are reared inside
 in covered yards.
