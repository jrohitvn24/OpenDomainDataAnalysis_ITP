		<title>01SUMMARY OF CONDOVER AREA.</title>
		<content> The area comprises an attractive      
 village,designated a conservation     
 area,situated four miles South of the 
 county town of Shrewsbury,and         
 occupying a well wooded site on the   
 plain surrounding the Cound brook.It  
 is probably from this brook that the  
 village takes its name.The village is 
 characterised by a wide variety of    
 architectural styles featuring        
 interesting sandstone walling and yew 
 hedging.Its outstanding feature is    
 Condover Hall probably the finest     
 Elizabethan house in Shropshire,      
 situated on the edge of the village,  
 adjacent to the church and in a       
 setting of formal gardens and avenues.
 The parish church dates back to Norman
 times.The remainder of the area is    
 rural though a small industrial site  
 and sand quarry exist.
