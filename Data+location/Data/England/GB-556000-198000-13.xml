		<content> The farms mostly grow{winter wheat}or 
{barley}with{oil seed rape}grown as a  
 break crop. The rape is grown for its 
 oil but is also a fertilizer when     
 ploughed back into the soil. It is not
 disease resistant and must be sprayed 
 many times. Mellow Purgess is a fruit 
 farm growing 6 acres of{Coxes Orange  
{Pippin}and 27 acres of wheat/rape.    
 Each wheat growing farm has its own   
 combine harvester and one has two.    
 The farmer at Place Farm also has a   
 farm at Blackmore and he says that the
 harvest is ready a fortnight before   
 Blackmore because of the soil, known  
 as{hot soil,}and the high flat        
 location of Doddinghurst.
