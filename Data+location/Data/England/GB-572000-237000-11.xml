		<title>11Harvest in Stambourne</title>
		<content> Harvest is a very busy time in Stam_  
 bourne and Toppesfield.This area is   
 good farmland,mainly rich boulder     
 clay.Cereals,potatoes,peas and oilseed
 rape are grown widely.The patchwork of
 colours in the fields is dominated in 
 early summer by the brilliant yellow  
 of the rape.As the fields turn golden 
 brown,harvest begins with two or even 
 three combine harvesters working in a 
 field.Moving these huge machines along
 narrow lanes is difficult and roads   
 usually have to be cleared in advance 
 to allow them to pass. Stubble and    
 discarded straw in the fields is often
 burnt but many people criticise this  
 because smoke and smuts create a mess 
 in people's homes.Toppesfield School  
 and local Churches hold Thanksgiving  
 Services and children traditionally   
 take gifts of harvest produce to      
 elderly and sick people.              </content>
