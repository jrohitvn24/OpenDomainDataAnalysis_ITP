		<content>   The main road running through our   
 area is the A37,the Roman Road from   
 Exeter to Lincoln.The road runs       
 straight in a S.W-N.E direction, &amp; has
 declined in importance since the      
 building of the M5 motorway.However   
 surveys taken in 1982 and 1984 show a 
 slight increase in trafic use from    
 5450 to 5500 daily average total flow 
 in both directions in a 16 hour day;  
 and use by vehicals of 1500 kilograms 
 and over (unladen) has increased from 
 570 to 630 for the same period        
   The only facilities for refreshment 
 along the road are a pub and a        
 restaurant.The Fosseway Stall is      
 manned and supplied by local          
 villagers during July and August      
 weekends,in aid of church funds.The   
 only public transport is a daily      
 National bus with no scheduled stop.
