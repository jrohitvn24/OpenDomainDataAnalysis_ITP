		<title>10A SCHOOLGIRL'S DAY.</title>
		<content>{ A 1st Year Girl at Swakeleys writes: 
  When I  wake up  in the morning I lay
 in bed until 7.15 a.m. and then  I  go
 downstairs and have a wash,then I  get
 dressed.   My  {uniform }is   a  white
 blouse,  a  grey  skirt  and  a  green
 jumper.  For breakfast I have toast or
 cereal. Then I clean my  teeth,  brush
 my hair and pack my  bag  for school.I
 go over  to my  friends house and then
 go on by car.                         
  I  have  4 "double"{lessons}in  a day
 but sometimes I have 5 classes because
 some of our lessons are split in half.
 On Monday I  have  Language,  Cooking,
 English  and  Needlework. My favourite
 lessons are Needlework and Cooking. In
 between each lesson we have a break.  
   At 3.30 we  go home. When I get home
 I get changed and do  my{homework. }At
 9.15 I go to bed.
