		<content>{Kielder Castle}was built in 1775 as a 
 Hunting-lodge for Hugh,1st Duke of    
 Northumberland. In 1930 it was        
 purchased by the Forestry Commission, 
 along with 19,000 hectares of land,   
 which now forms the main block of the 
 Kielder Forest. For many years the    
 castle was a Working Men's Club,      
 intended for the foresters.           
                                       
 Now Kielder Castle is the Commission's
 Information Centre, and provides      
 visitors with displays and exhibits   
 which show the history of the forest  
 and the cycle of work which is        
 necessary to maintain and develop it. 
 The Centre is open from Easter to     
 September.
