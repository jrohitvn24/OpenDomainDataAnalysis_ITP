		<content> Having remained reasonably static for 
 many years the population is now 1520.
 21% are aged 65 or over - the male    
 retirement age. 57% are between 18 and
 65; 15% between 5 and 18 and 7% under 
 5, when school starts. 10 families, 9%
 of the population, have roots in the  
 village back over 100 years. Some 50  
 families move into or out of the      
 village annually. 12% of the adults   
 below 65 work in Aldbourne, mostly in 
 building and allied trades. Shops and 
 small businesses employ others:       
 farming is still the major industry,  
 but with much reduced manpower. Many  
 are employed in varied trades and     
 industries in Swindon, Marlborough,   
 Newbury and Hungerford and as far as  
 London and Bristol. Many local people 
 are employed at one of Europes biggest
 egg packing stations at Membury. Less 
 than 2% are unemployed                </content>
