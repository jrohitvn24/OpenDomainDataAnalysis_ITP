		<title>16John Smith Celebrations</title>
		<content>  To mark the anniversary of the land- 
 ing of the first settlers' ship,there 
 are dual celebrations being held in   
 the village and in America.           
  On April 28th,the Governor of        
 Virginia,and many Virginians,came to  
 dedicate the{Virginia Panels}in the   
 local church.These stained glass      
 windows tell the story of the colony's
 founding and Smith's part in it.On the
 following day a replica of the ship,  
 the{Godspeed,}sailed from London bound
 for Virginia.The villagers and their  
 guests had a marvellous day and many  
 plans for future visits were made.    
  The one sad part was the lead up to  
 the installation of the panels.The    
 Diocesan Authority did not want them  
 put in despite the fact that the      
 villagers did.Finally,they were put in
 but in a chancel window instead of in 
 each of the nave windows.             </content>
