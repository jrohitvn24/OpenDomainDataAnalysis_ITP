		<content> Wreck remains Blackhead.              
 There are two wrecks in living memory.
 The PINDOS was wrecked on Chynhalls   
 Point at 9pm on 1st Februart 1912     
 after taking a cargo of nitrates from 
 Chile to Falmouth.She was a steel     
 masted barque of 2354 tons.The crew   
 were saved by the Coverack lifeboat   
 the Constance Melanie.                
 The GUNVOR a 3 masted steel barque    
 of 1491 tons ran onto Pedn Boar near  
 Blackhead on 6 April 1912 loaded with 
 nitrates under full sail.She was so   
 close to the cliffs that the bowsprit 
 overhung the rocks and the crew       
 lowered a rope ladder to get off.     
 Two fishermen from Coverack,crabbing  
 in the fog came upon the empty ship   
 with all sail set rammed on the cliff.
 Items may still come ashore.
