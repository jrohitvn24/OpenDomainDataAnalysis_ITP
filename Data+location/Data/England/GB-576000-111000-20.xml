		<content> Many children go to{organised clubs   
 (cubs, brownies, girls and boys       
 brigade, football); and have extra    
 lessons (dancing, skating,swimming).  
 Some of these are in our area, some in
 the centre of Hastings.               
 We thought about other leisure time.  
 The most popular{indoor activity}was  
 watching{television.}Many children    
 watched at least 3 hours an evening,  
 and had portable T.V. sets in their   
 bedrooms. Lots of children liked to   
 draw or play games (snooker, cards,   
 board games). Some preferred reading. 
{Outdoor games}were different in summer
 and winter. Many children, over two   
 thirds, have bikes and ride around the
 area a lot. They also liked playing   
 football and roller skating. Some     
 mentioned playing around the estate   
 and play parks.Less than half had a   
 summer holiday away from Hastings.    </content>
