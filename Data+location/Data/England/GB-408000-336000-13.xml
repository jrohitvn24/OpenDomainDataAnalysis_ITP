		<title>13EATON HALL FARM (Past)</title>
		<content> Mr.G.S.Allen is 86 years old and was  
 the previous owner of Eaton Hall farm.
 He owned the farm for 41 years from   
 1920.He used to run the farm with his 
 brothers,when it used to cover 226    
 acres.50 of these acres were ploughed 
 by horses.They produced milk from 60  
 Fresian and Short horn cows.They also 
 kept 60 breeding sheep and 12 pigs.   
 Electricity was not installed on the  
 farm until 1969 and paraffin lanterns 
 were originally used.The house was    
 heated by coal which was collected by 
 horse and cart from Rocester railway  
 station, which is no longer in        
 existence. The farm grounds contain   
 the foundations of Eaton Hall which   
 has not been a building for many      
 centuries. It is alleged that King    
 Charles 1 stayed one night at the     
 Hall.
