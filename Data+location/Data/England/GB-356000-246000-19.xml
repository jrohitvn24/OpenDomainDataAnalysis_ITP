		<title>19People &amp; Attitudes in Felton</title>
		<content> The area has retained its rural       
 character.  The villages are small and
 hidden down narrow, winding lanes.    
 The houses are old, half-timbered,    
 stone or brick.  The people are       
 descendants of old Herefordian        
 families carrying on traditional      
 farming occupations, although         
 increasingly people are moving in from
 Hereford or beyond.  Most of these    
 incomers work locally or travel to    
 work in Hereford.  The local          
 inhabitants are friendly to newcomers 
 and readily absorb them into the      
 community.  These newcomers have      
 generally bought properties in need of
 renovation.  The local people are     
 generally conservative in their       
 attitudes and traditional in their    
 persuits and way of life.
