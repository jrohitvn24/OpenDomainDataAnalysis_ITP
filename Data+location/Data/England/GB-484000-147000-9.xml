		<content>    T.S. Swiftsure was opened in       
 1974. T.S.stands for{Training Ship.}It
 is like a youth organisation for boys 
 and girls.                            
    The meetings are every Monday and  
 Friday and Thursday for band.There are
 nights that are used for boat pulling 
 too.                                  
    There are five different ranks to  
 progress through before you become an 
 officer. Before you get your uniform  
  you are a New Entry then you become a
 Junior Cadet, an Ordinary Seaman, an  
 Able Seaman, a Leading Cadet and at   
 last a Petty Officer. Before going    
 onto each rank you have to pass a test
 on all the things you have learnt in  
 that rank.                            
    The sea cadets also go on camps or 
 ships like T.S. Aberdovey and in the  
 Summer we go on Summer camp to Jersey.
