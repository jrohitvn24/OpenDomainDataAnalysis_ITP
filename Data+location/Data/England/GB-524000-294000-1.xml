		<title>01An overview of Whittlesey</title>
		<content>   Whittlesey was until twenty years   
 ago a small market town serving the   
 needs of the area.  Recently the town 
 has been expanded by the arrival of a 
 large influx of people mainly from the
 nearby city of Peterborough.  Old fen 
 families still form the nucleus of the
 population.                           
   The towns two 14th century churches 
 and 18th century market cross are the 
 notable architectural structures.     
   The main industries are farming and 
 brick making.  An industrial estate   
 on the outskirts of the town serves a 
 larger area of the fens.  The shops in
 town offer a wide range of day to day 
 goods most people shop in Peterborough
 for larger items.                     
   The politics of the area are Liberal
 but the people of Whittlesey follow   
 all three major parties without any   
 one dominating.                       </content>
