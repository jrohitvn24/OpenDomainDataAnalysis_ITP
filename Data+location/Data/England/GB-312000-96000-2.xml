 The landscape of the area is typical  
 of this part of Devon; predominately  
 that of dairy farming with small      
 hilly fields, ancient hedgerows and   
 lanes. However there are also large   
 areas of (mainly) deciduous woodland  
 on the higher ground, and to the East 
 a common of heath and scrub.          
 The parish is designated as an area of
 outstanding natural beauty and the    
 village is a conservation area.       
 The village used to be surrounded by  
 apple orchards. Some of these have    
 been felled but several large ones    
 remain. Cider apples are still grown. 
 Many beech trees were planted in the  
 18th century and the beech woods are  
 an outstanding feature.
