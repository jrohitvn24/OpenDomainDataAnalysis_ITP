 This Domesday Block, deep in the heart
 of rural Shropshire,is divided into 3 
 distinct sections and separated by 2  
 escarpments running from south-west to
 north-east.The north section in       
 Ape-dale,the central in Hope-dale,the 
 southern in Corve-dale.The underlying 
 rock is{ limestone}laid down in the   
 Silurian period,400 million years ago.
 Today,the escarpments are heavily     
 wooded,with a steep westerly face,and 
 a gentle dip-slope to the east.       
 The{valleys}vary in soil-type,the     
 northern being the lightest,populated 
 by a number of medium sized{mixed     
{farms.}The central Hope-dale has four 
 farms working on lime-based clay      
 soil,heavier in type. The southern    
 section has a heavy,much wetter       
 soil,covering parts of two large dairy
 farms.                                </content>
