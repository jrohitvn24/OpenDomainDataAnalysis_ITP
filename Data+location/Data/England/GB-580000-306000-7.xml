		<title>07CAMPING LANDS</title>
		<content> The Camping Lands is called that      
 because they used to play football on 
 there as it was a way of settling     
 arguments, Camping was the name of the
 game.It is now used for public grounds
 but you aren't allowed to camp on it  
 (in the sense of caravans).You are    
 allowed to play ball games but we     
 don't play camping now.Before the     
 Norfolk Youth And Community Services  
 building was built Hamonds school was 
 there in the 1960's it was left to rot
 and to fall down because they had     
 found a better place in the Market    
 Place.The Camping Lands is near       
 Swaffham Church.
