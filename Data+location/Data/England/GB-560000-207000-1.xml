		<title>01GENERAL LAND USE,ROXWELL</title>
		<content>     Our area is mostly farmland with  
 crops growing in most of the fields.  
{Corn}is grown mostly. There are three 
 kinds of{wheat}_ Rapier, Fenman and   
 Aquila. Other crops that are grown are
{oats and barley.}                     
     The earth under our area is very  
 heavy.There is a top soil then        
 underneath that is clay with bits     
 of flint mixed in. We get quite a lot 
 of floods because clay can't take in  
 water. Under that is sand which is    
 used for making roads and finally     
 under that is chalk.                  
     There are lots of streams running 
 through Roxwell. At Newland hall there
 are some lakes and lots of people go  
 to fish there,the fish that are in the
 lakes are mostly trout.               
     A few fields in our area are used 
 for keeping cattle which eat one and a
 half tons of mixed food a year.       </content>
