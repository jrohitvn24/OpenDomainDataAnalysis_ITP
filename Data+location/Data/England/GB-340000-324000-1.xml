		<content> Weston Lullingfield is a small        
 village in a sparsely populated area  
 of North Shropshire.   It is fairly   
 flat and was very marshy until it was 
 drained, beginning in the 1880's.     
 The fields are mainly grazing and     
 arable where the land rises above the 
 peat marshes.   The village is in two 
 settlements - Top Weston and Weston   
 Wharf with Weston Common.  The church 
 lies midway between them.   The only  
 public buildings are the church, the  
 school and the Village Hall.   There  
 are no shops now, although when the   
 canal was in use there were more      
 people and there was a Post Office,   
 butcher's, grocer's and general       
 stores(closed 1978).   There are no   
 parks or recreation grounds.
