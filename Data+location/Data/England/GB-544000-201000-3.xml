		<title>03EPPING'S GREEN BARRIER</title>
		<content> You can never feel there is not       
 somewhere to have a quiet walk in     
{Epping.Epping Forest}is there for your
 enjoyment.It cost Â£8,000,000 to run   
 annually,and is now about 6,000 acres 
 but was 10 times bigger 200 years     
 ago.It covers{Theydon Bois,Buckhurst  
{Hill,Chingford,Loughton,}and the      
 boundaries of{London,}as well as      
 Epping.The conservators do jobs like  
 cutting down trees (which they don't  
 replant because of natural regrowth), 
 keeping the Forest tidy,and patrolling
 it.More people are riding vehicles    
 illegally through Epping Forest,taking
 horses in prohibited parts,using      
 firearms, throwing litter,and hunting 
 with a dog. The punishment for these  
 offences is usually a fine.Holding    
 back London from the people of Epping,
 this God-made{nature reserve}is a     
 pleasure for which they are grateful. </content>
