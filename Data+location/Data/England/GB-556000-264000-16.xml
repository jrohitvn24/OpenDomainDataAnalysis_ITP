		<title>16SPRING CLOSE BURWELL.</title>
		<content>{Spring Close}is an area where everyone
 can play.{The Parish Council}has      
 recently{bought it for Â£20,000.       
 There are{remains of a castle}_ some  
 hills and a marsh in the moat _ with  
 hundreds of pathways.                 
  Children have made a{BMX track}here. 
 Near the stream is a{rope swing.}Cow's
 come down to the stream.A road near by
 is called{Mandeville }because         
 Geoffrey De Mandeville was a robber   
 baron in Ely.King Stephen built       
 castles around Ely to trap him.But    
 Geoffrey straight away attacked       
{Burwell Castle}while it was being     
 built.He was hit and  carried off     
 to Mildenhall where he died.There     
 were thought to be catapult and seige 
 mounds but they were really           
 wheel-barrow tracks and soil dumps.   
 Other clues showed that the castle was
 never finished.                       </content>
