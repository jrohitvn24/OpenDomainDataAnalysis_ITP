Wood Lane is on the far side of Apedale
from Chesterton.   It is a small,      
friendly village although a large      
housing estate has increased the       
population recently.   There is plenty 
of entertainment such as a Youth Club  
with disco dancing for children, the   
Liberty Workingmen's Club and          
Institute, a Sunday School, a park and 
a chapel.   Vandalism is not very      
common in Wood Lane.   It is an        
agricultural area with many farms      
dotted around.   There are no other    
industries beside farming.   There     
isn't a supermarket but they do have   
a Post Office and general store and    
a butcher's.
