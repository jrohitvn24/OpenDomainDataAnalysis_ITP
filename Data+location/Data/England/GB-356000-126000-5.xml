		<content>        In our area there are about    
 1000 mm of rain per annum. About 180  
 days of the year are rainy and the    
 average number of mornings with snow  
 is between 10 and 15 days. There are  
 about 5 hours of bright sunshine a    
 day on average.                       
        Here, as in most country areas,
 people are all for conservation.      
        Something like 1000 trees were 
 planted by a local farmer because so  
 many Elms were killed by the Dutch Elm
 disease ten years ago. Rather than    
 planting whole fields of trees, the   
 new trees are being planted in hedges 
 and other places where crops can not  
 be grown.                             
        There are not many factories   
 around us so there is not too much    
 pollution.                            
                                       
                                       </content>
