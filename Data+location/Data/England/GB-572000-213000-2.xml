		<title>02ST.MARY'S CHURCH, GT.LEIGHS</title>
		<content>   This church was built by the        
 Normans, possibly on a Saxon          
 foundation. The most outstanding      
 feature of it is the Round Tower,one  
 of only six in Essex.It was built of  
 flint rubble as there was no local    
 stone that could be used.             
   There is some unusual carving in the
 church as well as a brass memorial to 
 a priest that has had a different head
 added to it from an earlier period .
