 We went to Tawstock Church on the     
 27th.June 1985 to answer some         
 questions about the church and look   
 around to find out different things.  
 We looked around the outside of the   
 church where there were lots of grave 
 stones among the long,dry grass, many 
 of the grave stones were very old and 
 the writing had faded so it wasn't    
 very clear. As we went round to the   
 entrance, above the door was a very   
 old sundial which was still there     
 after many years.                     
  The entrance to the churchyard is by 
 a handsome{lych gate}of fairly recent 
 origin.
