		<title>12A Day In The Life Of....</title>
		<content>     A normal day in my life starts by 
 me waking up at 7.30, then I usually  
 have a read until about 7.40 when I   
 go down-stairs to have cerial for     
 breakfast.  I then try to get to the  
 bathroom before my brother Ben to     
 clean my teeth, wash my face and brush
 my hair.  Then I get dressed at about 
 8.00 and get my things ready for      
 school.  I go to school at 8.30 and   
 play until 8.55 when we go into       
 school.  In school we do some work and
 have register and at 9.10 we go for   
 assembly.  After assembly we do Maths 
 and English group work until break at 
 10.30.  After play we do more class   
 work until lunch at 12.10. After lunch
 we have play until 1.10 and then we   
 lessons until last play from 2.30 to  
 2.45.  School ends at 3.30, when I go 
 home and play with my brother Ben.
