		<content> My hobby  is fishing because it is    
 relaxing and you can go day or night.I
 go to the weir in Stratford-on-Avon.  
 The fish thier are Chub,Pike,Carp and 
 Rudd.The main tackle you need is a    
 reel,fishing rod and line,a float and 
 a hook.Shaun Dallisson nine years old.
 Windsurfing can be a sport or it can  
 be just for fun.I am learning to      
 windsurf.You can get lots of different
 boards.You can get jump boards so that
 if you are by a big wave you can jump 
 it.My dad has a sail board.I cannot   
 use it because the sail is to         
 heavy for me.Tomas Watts aged 9       
 years.I go riding at Ettington.I have 
 a pony of my own.She is a grey pony   
 called Pepsi.She is a very good       
 gymkhana pony.I have won two rossettes
 on her.We pay Â£6:00 a week for her to 
 be kept and fed at Ettington Manor.
