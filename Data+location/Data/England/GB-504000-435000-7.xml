     {Thearne}comes as quite a surprise
 to the first time visitor.  Turning   
 from the main Hull-Beverley road the  
 pace and atmosphere changes           
 immediately.  Thearne is a place of   
 peace and quiet with rural charm.     
      The largest building in the      
 village is the hall,  although this is
 of fairly modest proportions.  An     
 interesting conversion has been made  
 to the village chapel,  now used as a 
 commercial art studio.                
      In former times a ferry operated 
 across the river Hull to the village  
 of {Wawne}but thi closed about fifteen
 years ago.                            
      The surrounding countryside is   
 lightly wooded and used for mixed     
 farming and market gardening.
