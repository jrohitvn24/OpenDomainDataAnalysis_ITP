		<title>11WIMBLEBALL SAILING CLUB</title>
		<content> This club used to sail on Clatworthy  
 Reservoir but move here when          
 Wimbleball was completed. The club has
 some 285 members (this includes family
 membership) and there are also 90     
 school members.                       
 Membership of the club costs less than
 Â£20 a year which makes it one of the  
 cheapest in the country. The sailing  
 is excellent because the hills on     
 either side of the lake are not too   
 steep to act as wind breaks.          
 The boats sailed there include lasers,
 solos, toppers, kestrels, marks,      
 enterprises and otters and there are  
 also some catamarans.                 
 The membership comes mainly from the  
 surrounding counties but some live as 
 far afield as London but have holiday 
 cottages in the area. They had an open
 meeting at Easter attracting entries  
 from a large area.                    </content>
