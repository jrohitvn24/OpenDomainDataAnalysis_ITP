		<title>12 EDUCATION</title>
		<content>Educational facilities within the area 
range from playgroups,for pre-school   
age children to colleges for Further   
Education. For children of school age  
there are:Infant schools for ages 5 to 
7; Junior schools for ages 7 to 11;    
Secondary Modern or Grammar Schools for
ages 11 to 16,plus sixth forms at      
Grammar Schools for the 16 to 18 age   
group. Unlike many parts of Kent,the   
area has a selection procedure at age  
11for the most suitable type of        
secondary education for each child.This
involves a reasoning test,a school's   
assessment of each child and parental  
wishes. Following this, each child on  
leaving Junior school will attend      
either a Secondary Modern School or a  
Grammar School. The area also offers a 
Youth Training Scheme to enable        
unemployed school leavers to learn a   
skill                                  </content>
