		<title>07Pubs, Inns at Aston Clinton</title>
		<content>     There are 10 pubs in our survey   
 area. One is the Rothschilds Arms,    
 which received its name from the      
 Rothschilds who lived in Halton and   
 Aston Clinton about 120 years ago.    
 They were bankers and built many fine 
 houses. The names of some more pubs   
 are the Rising Sun, the New Inn and   
 the Robin Hood.                       
     The Bell is the most famous Inn in
 our area. Many famous people have     
 stayed there and it has many exotic   
 menus such as  Crab Andaluse and      
 Avocado Salad. The sweet Mille Feuille
 is strawberries and cream in flaky    
 pastry. These change with the seasons.
 The old brewery is now part of the    
 hotel. Prices for twin or double rooms
 cost between 40 and 60 pounds a       
 night. This hotel is famous across the
 country for its excellent standard of 
 cooking.                              </content>
