		<title>08HALL PLACE, BEXLEYHEATH</title>
		<content> This area is chiefly open space, with 
 a small housing content. The major    
 feature of the area is Hall Place and 
 its grounds.                          
                                       
 Hall Place dates from 1540, with some 
 evidence of earlier houses from the   
 13th. Century onwards.  As it stands, 
 it is part-Tudor, part-Jacobean, stone
 and brick together with a Tudor built 
 brick barn.                           
                                       
 Topiary; a herb garden; sunken garden 
 and rockery; rose beds and lawns      
 together with greenhouses; all of     
 which are open for public viewing all 
 year round.                           
                                       
 The remaining open space is used as   
 sports grounds and open grassland,    
 with the River Cray forming its       
 southerly border.                     </content>
