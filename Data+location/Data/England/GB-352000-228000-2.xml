		<title>02LOWER RUXTON FARM</title>
		<content> Mr David Jenkins keeps sheep and      
 cattle at the moment. He owns{500     
 sheep and loses approximately{12}a    
 year because of disease. The average  
 cost of a lamb is{Â£35}but it varies   
 throughout the year. He puts{60}acres 
 of his land aside for these animals.  
 Mr Jenkins uses the rest of his land  
 for crops. This year he is growing    
 wheat, barley,sugar beet and potatoes.
 The wheat is sold for a good price and
 he feeds the barley and sugar beet    
 tops to the animals. On the farm he   
 keeps quite a lot of modern machinery 
 and he uses it a lot. The soil varies 
 throughout his land. It tends to be   
 dry and gravelly in high places and   
 moist down by the River Wye.
