		<content> In the year 1068 there was a manor in 
 ALSAGER but no recorded population.The
{Domesday Book}entry reveals "The Earl 
 himself hold Eleacier, Uluric a tree  
 man held it. There is a half hide     
 rateable to the gelt. The land is one 
 carucate. It is waste". By the{twelfth
{century}Alsager was a township in     
 Barthomley Parish. In{1801}there were 
 49 houses and 275 people and by 1810  
 there were 349 people. Between 1801   
 and 1831 land enclosure attracting    
 newcomers doubled the population. The 
 arrival of the railway turned Alsager 
 from a country hamlet into a dormitory
 town for 'The Potteries'. One hundred 
 years later in{1948}the population was
 4000 due mainly to the establishment  
 of the Royal Ordnance Factory. In     
{1970} the population was 10,580 in    
{1985 }it is approximately 12,000 and  
 residential development continues.    </content>
