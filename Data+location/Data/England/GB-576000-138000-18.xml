This has been a thoroughly beneficial  
exercise for the pupils but one or     
two  alterations would have helped.    
                                       
                                       
  1. the text editor (word proccessor) 
supplied is incredibly slow and        
cumbersome, especially when it has     
to move text onto another line. It     
is also very unwieldy.                 
                                       
  2. We would have appreciated the     
software a little earlier in order     
to have made a better job and to       
have involved more pupils.             
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
