		<title>02S. ANDREW'S CHURCH</title>
		<content>      In August 1158 Henry II gave the 
 monastery of S. Nicholas and S.       
 Benedict in Montjoux a grant of land  
 in Havering worth twenty-five pounds a
 year.   By 1163 they are known to have
 built a church on the site.   Most of 
 the present church is built in the    
 perpendicular style.                  
      Today S. Andrew's church has a   
 parish of about thirty-two thousand   
 people although a maximum of 300 can  
 attend each service.   During an      
 average week 6 weddings, 6 funerals   
 and 4 christenings take place.        
      S. Andrew's is the only church   
 in England that has a bull's head on  
 it.   It is an unusual feature to find
 on a church.   The bull has horns and 
 this is where we get the name of our  
 town:{"HORNCHURCH"(The Horned Church).
