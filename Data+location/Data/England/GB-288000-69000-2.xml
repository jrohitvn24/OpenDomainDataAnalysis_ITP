		<content> In the late seventies the centre of   
 Stokeinteignhead was made a           
 conservation area. The aim was to     
 preserve the essential character of   
 the village. New buildings have been  
 permitted and others converted so that
 the village can remain 'alive' and not
 become a museum. When in l982 the     
 village school was reroofed the old   
 slates were replaced by artificial    
 slates so that the character of the   
 building was retained. Many buildings 
 still retain thatched roofs although  
 insurance premiums for such buildings 
 are very high.
