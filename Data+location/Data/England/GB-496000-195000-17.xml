		<title>17SOCIAL CONCERNS</title>
		<content> Exactly 85 years after the opening of 
 Marylebone Station,British Rail in    
 1984 announced its closure but        
 rejected the idea of converting the   
 High Wycombe and Aylesbury lines into 
 clearways. Commuters using Little     
 Chalfont and Latimer Station (on the  
 Aylesbury line) would have to travel  
 to Paddington instead. B.R. claimed it
 would save a substantial amount of    
 money and generate finance by         
 redeveloping Marylebone. Commuters    
 argued that their fares would increase
 by up to 20% since they would need to 
 travel from Paddington to their place 
 of work instead of walking from       
 Marylebone. A pressure group was      
 formed to keep the station open.      
 Residents became interested as one of 
 the area's attractions is easy access 
 to Central London. In spite of appeals
 B.R.rejected alternative plans.       </content>
