   During the second world war,about   
 two hundred airmen were based in      
 Scorton.Some of them lived in huts in 
 a field near the hospital.This is     
 where Clarence Road is now.Others     
 lived at Bolton-on Swale,and some on  
 the site next to school.The R.A.F.had 
 its own water supply.It was a bore    
 hole,behind where the police station  
 now stands.                           
   At the Forest there were false      
 runway lights.They were to distract   
 the German pilots from bombing the    
 real aerodrome at Scorton.            
   Around Scorton and at the Forest    
 there were powerful searchlights to   
 spot enemy aircraft approaching to    
 bomb Catterick Garrison.              
   As well as British airmen,a few     
 Americans were also based here.
