      A typical day begins at 6.45am.  
 The husband shaves and goes off to    
 work on board ship in the R.N.        
 Dockyard.  He travels across by       
 boat,which can be uncomfortable in the
 winter.                               
      When he has gone,his wife goes   
 back to sleep! When she wakes up -or  
 is woken by the children, she sends   
 them off to school.  She then has     
 breakfast and gets out the vacuum     
 cleaner before getting ready for work.
      After tidying up she says        
 "Goodbye" to Sam,the dog and sets off 
 for work at the Hyperstore,where she  
 has a hectic days work.               
      Home again at around 5pm,it's    
 time for tea and afterwards maybe     
 watching the television if there's any
 time to relax!                        </content>
