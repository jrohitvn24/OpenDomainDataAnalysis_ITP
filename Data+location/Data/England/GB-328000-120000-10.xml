		<content>   Huish Woods was given to the Scouts,
 Guides, Brownies and Cubs by a local  
 landowner. Skip Govet, founded the    
 site and each Scout and Cub, Guide and
 Brownie pack from the surrounding area
 has a camping site there. It is       
 situated near Bath House Farm by the  
 A358. Groups usually only camp for the
 weekend.                              
   The main parts of the woods are the 
 "Monkey Parlour",the "Chapel" and     
 "Gore_Langton Hall" which commemorates
 the person who donated the site to the
 Scouts. There is also a car park. The 
 "Monkey Parlour" is a big play area   
 with ropes and tree trunks made into  
 play equipment. The "Chapel" is       
 outdoors and has an altar with a cross
 on it. "Gore_Langton Hall",situated at
 the end of a long track,is a hall used
 for wet weather activities.
