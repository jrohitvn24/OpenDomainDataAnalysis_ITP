		<title>16RIVER EVENLODE AT CHARLBURY</title>
		<content> The river that runs through Charlbury 
is called the River Evenlode.It's      
source is near Moreton in Marsh.It     
runs beside Walcot Farm and there is a 
weir there.  In Charlbury the bridge   
that crosses the River on Dyers Hill   
has been there since the Middle Ages.  
There are two bridges, including       
Jubilee Bridge, which cross the river  
and the river also runs through the    
Evenlode valley.The big house by the   
river used to be a toll house.There is 
a canoeing club which takes place on a 
Sunday afternoon.Quite a few people    
fish in the river and many children    
like to paddle and swim there.The      
river also runs by the Railway and is  
very windy.It flows into the River     
Thames near Eynsham.The Evenlode       
Valley gets it's name from the river   
running through it.
