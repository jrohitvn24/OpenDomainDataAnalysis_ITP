		<title>15WARRINGTON FESTIVAL</title>
		<content>    The first {Festival} was held in   
 1972. It provides entertainment of all
 kinds through a variety of events. A  
 survey by Central London Polytechnic  
 has vindicated the claim that it is   
 "{The Best In The North West}". The   
 Festival can take up to two years to  
 organise, some typical events being;  
 Warrington Secondary Schools Music    
 Festival, The Festival Tennis         
 Tournament, Finals Day and Festival   
 Fun Day.                              
    For the Festival to continue in its
 present form, funds must be attracted 
 in the form of sponsorships and other 
 means. This responsibility is taken on
 by representatives of the Borough     
 Council,the Development Corporation   
 and Industry and Commerce.
