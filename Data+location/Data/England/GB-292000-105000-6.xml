		<title>06A FARMER'S DAY</title>
		<content> The farmer's day starts around 6.30   
 when his first job is to milk the     
 cows. Then he visits the sheep and    
 bullocks to ensure they are all right,
 before breakfast at 8.00. Shortly     
 after 8.30 he prepares the tractors,  
 mower, baler and other machinery      
 needed for hay harvest, which takes   
 him until lunchtime at 1.00. An hour  
 later he rounds up the sheep for      
 shearing, and also selects some lambs 
 for the Fatstock Market at Exeter on  
 Monday. Store Market is on Friday.    
 After half an hour for tea at 6.00 he 
 decides to start cutting a field of   
 grass for hay. Around 9.00 he tackles 
 the updating of the Farm Accounts     
 before watching the television news at
 10.00 and finally going to bed.
