		<title>20Flooding at Hampton Bishop.</title>
		<content>  There have been several floods in the
 area around Hampton Bishop.The village
 was built on low land close to the    
 confluence of the{River Wye}and the   
{River Lugg.                           
  A bank was built to help prevent the 
 water reaching the village.This was   
 called,{'The Stank'.                  
  In 1960 the area was flooded in      
 January and December.In January parts 
 of the village were covered in water  
 up to{seven feet}deep.People were     
 rescued from their homes by the       
 R.A.F.,the W.R.V.S. and the Police.   
  The flood in December was even       
 worse.The Stank began to crack and    
 break. The army used boats and a      
 helicopter to take people to Hereford 
 until the water subsided.Farmers were 
 unable to use their fields for three  
 weeks .
