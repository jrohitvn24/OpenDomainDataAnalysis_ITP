		<title>04Dartford Heath</title>
		<content>   Dartford Heath, now split by the A2,
 Dartford bypass, is on a gravelly     
 terrace of the River Thames, and is   
 clothed with small trees such as      
 Hawthorn, Sallow and Silver Birch.    
 Shrubs like Gorse, Broom and Brambles 
 abound-interspread with grasses and   
 wild flowers.                         
   Open areas have been made over to   
 cricket and football pitches. Local   
 people can find something to interest 
 them at every season. It is an        
 ornithologists paradise-but bird      
 spotters are no longer likely to see  
 the rare Dartford Warbler whose last  
 sronghold is now only on the S.Coast. 
   Sadly children are not encouraged to
 play alone on the heath. Heath fires  
 are now common place on the heath.
