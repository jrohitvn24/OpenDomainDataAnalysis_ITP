		<content>{(Coppice primary school)  }           
 The school was built in January 1953  
 as an infants school, in 1962 it      
 became a Primary school. The school   
 has had six headteachers. In the      
 opinion of our infant teachers who    
 have been here since the school has   
 been built the area is a lot better.  
 The children come from smaller        
 families and can behave better. Pupils
 at the school have worked on this     
 project. {(Employment in Marlpool)}   
 We asked 55 junior aged children about
 their parents' jobs. There are 46     
 fathers who work and 34 mothers. 14
