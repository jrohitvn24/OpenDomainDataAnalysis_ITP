		<title>08HOW TO SKIP</title>
		<content> First of all find a long rope.  Get   
 two people to stand one at each end of
 the rope.  Turn the rope in a circular
 fashion making the rope touch the     
 ground each time you turn it.  A third
 person runs in when the rope is in the
 air and waits till the rope comes near
 the feet then jumps across the rope.  
 Keep doing this.  Now you have learned
 to skip.             {                
{UNDERS AND OVERS}                     
 When the rope is in the air run under 
 it straight to the other side.  When  
 you have done this you go over the    
 rope, straight to the other side.     
 Next you go under the rope and skip   
 once then over an skip twice.  Carry  
 on doing this until someone is out.   
 Then you start again.                 
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
