		<title>03FARMING AROUND ROTHWELL</title>
		<content> Most of the area is semi-rural.There  
  are pockets of habitation with many  
 outlaying farms. The majority of farms
 grow cereal crops. One or two however 
 are dairy farms which grow their own  
 barley to support their livestock. The
 area is famous for rhubarb cultivation
 being very close to the 'Rhubarb      
 triangle'. There are forcing sheds to 
 enable the farmers to provide rhubarb 
 throughout the year. This rhubarb is  
 forced and picked by candlelight to   
 help its development. Rhubarb is also 
 grown in rotation in the fields for   
 later crops. In the South Eastern part
 of the area there is oil seed rape    
 which at present also supports        
 honeybees as a secondary product.     
 Certain farms are geared to vegetable 
 and market garden produce with small  
 farm shops providing fresh vegetables 
 for customers from Leeds and Wakefield</content>
