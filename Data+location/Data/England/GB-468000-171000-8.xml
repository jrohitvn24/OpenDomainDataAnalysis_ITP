		<content> The area is full of a mixture of new  
 and old buildings.Many of the older   
 houses toward the centre of the town  
 are made of local bricks from the     
 kilns in Water and Elgar Rd.There is  
 terraced property towards the centre  
 of the town;built in the distinct red 
 brick with white patterning in the top
 half of the house.This feature has    
 also been used in the new houses which
 have been built near the Inner        
 Distribution road.                    
     The farther one travels from the  
 town centre,the houses are both owner 
 occupied and council with large       
 gardens.There are many flats in the   
 Southcote area to the south.The       
 housing estates towards the edge of   
 the area date from 1950 onwards.The   
 area of Tilehurst to the west has been
 built up around an old village.
