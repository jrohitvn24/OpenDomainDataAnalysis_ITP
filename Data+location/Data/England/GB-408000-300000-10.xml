Little Aston is a pleasant, desirable  
neighbourhood within easy reach of     
several towns, consequently there is   
a great deal of movement, people are   
constantly moving into or out of the   
area due to the needs of their jobs.   
Only a small proportion of the         
inhabitants have lived there all their 
lives, the rest are from all parts of  
the British Isles, with just a very few
from abroad.
