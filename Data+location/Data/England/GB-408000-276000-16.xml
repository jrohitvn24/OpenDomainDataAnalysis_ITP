		<content> CANALS                                
 The Stratford-upon-Avon Canal crosses 
 the block from N.W.to S.E. Today it is
 used mainly for pleasure &amp;            
 recreation.Most of the boats are      
 converted narrow-boats or cabin       
 cruisers.In places the tow-path is in 
 very poor condition due to erosion    
 caused by,the wash of boats,          
 pedestrians &amp; lack of maintenance.A   
 striking feature in this area is a    
 lifting bridge known locally as the   
 "Draw-bridge".The bridge is operated  
 with a special key carried by the boat
 passengers.Approximately 400m from the
 Draw-bridge the canal crosses a road  
 via an Aqueduct.This feature gives its
 name to the road passing beneath.     
 Fishing is a popular recreation       
 carried on along the tow-path.
