		<title>04FARMING: DAIRYING</title>
		<content> In June 1985, a 5 year struggle ended 
 to preserve a herd of 258 pedigree    
{Friesian dairy cattle,}with the       
 respected 'Deerhurst' prefix, started 
 at Wightfield Manor in 1919 by Alfred 
 Ludlow-Hewitt.  The top bid  was 600  
 guineas (Â£630) for 'Deerhurst Baby'.  
 There are two major reasons for the   
 failure of this herd.  Firstly the{   
{E.E.C.,}to which Britain has belonged 
 since 1972, has sought to cut         
 excessive milk production by the      
 imposition of quotas which have hit   
 British dairy farmers particularly    
 harshly.  Consequently to change the  
 method of farming requires the        
 abandoning of capital equipment and   
 purchase of new machinary since this  
 is the foundation of agricultural     
 efficiency.  Record rates of interest 
 on borrowed capital has forced the    
 owners to sell their farm &amp; herd.     </content>
