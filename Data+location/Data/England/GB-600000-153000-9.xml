		<title>09Badlesmere : Employment</title>
		<content> Farming is the only industry - 9O% of 
 agricultural land is tenant farmed.   
 Main farmers are the Scutt family     
 (around Badlesmere) and the Holmes    
 family, both of whom farm land mainly 
 owned by the Sondes Estate, employing 
 between them some lO local people. A  
 one-man jobbing concern on Badlesmere 
 Lees employs casual labour.  The      
 Badlesmere Stores (general            
 provisions)is run by a family as is   
 the Deepdene Riding Stables (provision
 for l9 horses) which currently has 4  
 trainee instructors.  Family          
 breadwinners must travel to London (l 
 hour by train from Faversham), the    
 Medway towns, Ashford or Canterbury.  
 Unemployment in the area is currently 
 l4.5% compared with the national      
 average of l3.5%.
