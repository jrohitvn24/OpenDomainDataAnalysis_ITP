		<title>11SLIT WOOD: WESTGATE</title>
		<content>     Slit Wood is a popular beauty     
 spot at Westgate. The wood is a dene  
 along the banks of Middlehope Burn.   
 Many tourists visit Slit Wood to walk 
 and have picnics. The stream with its 
 series of waterfalls is very pretty   
 but the visitors are picking some of  
 the rarer plants.                     
     At the top of the wood are the    
 remains of some old lead and ironstone
 mines. The Slit Vein was one of the   
 richest in the area and pieces of     
 galena and fluorspar can be found in  
 the stream. Limestone fossils are also
 abundant in the valley.               
    In the old dam above the lead      
 workings mallard, teal, and moorhen   
 can be found. The wood itself is rich 
 in animal and plant life and salmon   
 and sea trout spawn in the stream.
