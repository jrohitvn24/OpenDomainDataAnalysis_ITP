		<title>12Fireman's Family</title>
		<content> My name is Kerry Hannington I am 10   
 years old. My father works for Colt   
 Cars Cirencester, but he has been     
 a part-time{Fireman}at{Malmesbury     
{Fire Station}for 12 years.            
 I think my dad is very brave,but I do 
 not worry very much about him only if 
 he does not come home for a long time.
 My brother Paul says he likes dad     
 being in the Fire Brigade because it  
 is exciting. None of the Malmesbury   
 firemen have been killed but my dad   
 was hospitalised once with heat       
 exhaustion.Mum worried for the first  
 few years but has now put it to the   
 back of her mind.Sometimes she gets   
 annoyed when arrangements have to be  
 cancelled. Once my dad was called out 
 just as he was eating his{Christmas   
 dinner.Mum feels proud to have a      
 husband in the Fire Brigade and the   
 service he is providing for others.   </content>
