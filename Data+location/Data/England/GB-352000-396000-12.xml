 permit is Â£1, but a man's permit is   
 Â£10. You can catch pike,skimmer,roach,
 bream, gudgeon, carp and tench.You can
 see speedboats and water-skiing on    
 Sunday and can walk round it in about 
 2 hours. Children can swim and dig at 
 a sandy shore. It is also good for    
 watching birds.                       
 The{Sankey Valley Linear Park}(opened 
 1981) runs south from Carr Mill Dam to
 Blackbrook, then ESE to Newton-le-    
 Willows. The Rangers' Centre, where   
 the 6 employees are based is in       
 Blackbrook behind the{Ship Inn}. In   
 1984, 7500 people booked guided visits
 to the park and many more made casual 
 visits. The park runs along the length
 of the now disused Sankey Canal, which
 was used to take coal from collieries 
 near Blackbrook.
