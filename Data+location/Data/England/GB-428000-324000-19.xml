		<content> Surprisingly many people we           
 interviewed said that they were not   
 aware of any{construction}taking place
 in the village.                       
 In point of fact there were several   
 major{projects}under way or           
 which have recently been{completed.}  
 They are at Pinfold Close, Meadows    
 Close, Repton Primary Shool, Homelands
 - an old people's home, The Abbey - a 
 girl's boarding house, the health     
 centre.                               
  The most recent major building in the
 area was the conversion of the Old    
 Sanatorium into a music school as part
 of Repton School's half a million     
 pound development programme. This was 
 opened in July by the Duchess of Kent.
