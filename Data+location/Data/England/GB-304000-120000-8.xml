 Interview continued.                  
                                       
       In the fields the rabbits used  
 to run out of the way of the horse and
 plough and men used to stay up very   
 late to catch them to eat. Children   
 used to stay up until 10 o'clock to   
 watch and they used to play hide and  
 seek in the bales.                    
       The children at school had slate
 pencils. They used to knit and sew a  
 lot and embroidered clothes. Each     
 child brought their own potato to     
 school for their lunch as there was no
 school kitchen to provide a meal. They
 would chalk their name on their potato
 and it would be placed close to the   
 big iron stove to cook.               
       The children took turns to pump 
 water for use in the school.
