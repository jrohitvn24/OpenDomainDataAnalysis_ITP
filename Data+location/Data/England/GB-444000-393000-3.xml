		<title>03TYPICAL DAY OF A STEELWORKER</title>
		<content> A steelworker gets up{early}in the    
 morning. Most of them go to work in a 
 car. When they get to work they have  
 to put on{special clothing.}They      
 mostly have to wear helmets for      {
{safety}and so no sparks get in their  
 eyes with hard shoes to protect their 
 feet.They wear overalls so they do not
 get dirty. Most steelworkers take a   
 packed lunch, and eat in a cabin or a 
 office. The average man works{eight   
{hours}a day and nearly all of them    
 work{shifts.}Their favourite          
{hobbies}are sports, like football,    
 fishing and weight training. Most of  
 the{fathers}and{grandfathers}of the   
 workers worked at B.S.C. too. Some of 
 the companies run a social club. The  
 wokers like to spend their{leisure    
 time at home, watching television     
 because when they get home from work  
 they are very{tired.                  </content>
