		<content> Housing tends to be where the         
 employment is,as{public transport     
 within and out of this area is very   
 sparse.Most people live in farm houses
 or tied cottages where they work.     
 There are no housing projects or      
 groups of houses,other than those     
 attached to farms.The people who work 
 at the residential establishments     
 either live on the premises or out of 
 the area,travelling in daily.         
 Several of the farms have recently    
 renovated their farm houses,or built  
 new ones with central heating and     
 modern fitted kitchens.
