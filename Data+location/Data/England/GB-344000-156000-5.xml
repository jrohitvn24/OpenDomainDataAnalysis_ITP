		<content>  Mr.Harwood's garage is opposite the  
 Church and he has been the owner for  
 the last 21 years. It has mainly white
 walls and the windows and doors are   
 painted blue. It has a tarmac floor   
 and the sweet shop is on the left hand
 side. He has 2 big workshops on the   
 right as well as a little wall. He    
 sells Butler petrol and it is a       
 Vehicle Testing Station for the       
 Ministry of Transport.                
  We all asked 2 questions.  He said   
 that he sold about 250 gallons each   
 day, but on a Tuesday sometimes even  
 more. He always wanted to be his own  
 boss so he is very happy in his work. 
 He said that he often sold sweets to  
 the children at weekends.             
  We all thought that he was a clever  
 builder because he added his own house
 onto the Garage building.
