		<content>{Methodist:}There is a Methodist Chapel
 in the centre of the village          
 overlooking the mill square.  Services
 are held each Sunday and there are    
 also such things as Sunday School as  
 well as discussion groups for older   
 people.  The chapel tends to be a     
 focal point for many Methodists in the
 area.  The Methodist Minister lives in
 Garstang.                             
                                       
{Roman Catholic: }At present people of 
 the Roman Catholic faith worship in a 
 room set aside for that purpose above 
 the Post Office in Calder Vale.  This 
 arragement has been going on for some 
 years.  Sometime in the near future   
 they will be moving to the "Mission   
 Room" which adjoins the village hall. 
 This room is owned and used           
 occasionally by the people of St      
 John's CE Church.                     </content>
