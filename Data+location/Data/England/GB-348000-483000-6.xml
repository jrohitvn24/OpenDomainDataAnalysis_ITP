		<content> Parts of Heversham Hall are 985 years 
 old.  It is a dairy farm, with 80     
 dairy cows, l00 heffers and two bulls.
  Each morning Mr. and Mrs. Handly get 
 up at 6.00 p.m. and milk the cows.    
 The milking parlour has ten spaces    
 five each side, the cows wait their   
 turn in a space.  When it is their    
 turn, the next ten cows are let in.   
 They go into their spaces.  There is a
 well in the floor about four feet down
 where you stand.  In this space there 
 are controls to let the cows have food
 while they are milked.  The amount of 
 food can be varied to suit each cow.  
 There are four suction plugs which are
 put on the cows udders.  The milk goes
 into a glass truck jar to see how much
 milk they are giving then they record 
 it.  The milk empties into a          
 refrigerator tank where it is churned 
 to keep fresh till the milk tanker    </content>
