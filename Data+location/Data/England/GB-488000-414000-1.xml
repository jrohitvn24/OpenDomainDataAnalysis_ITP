		<content> Normanby is some 6 or 7km NNW of      
 Scunthorpe.The area is one of         
 contrasts.To the south west of the    
 area there are the remains of the now 
 redundant British Steel Corporation's 
 Normanby Park works.The works are now 
 being dismantled and the ground       
 landscaped.In the north west there is 
 Normanby Hall Country Park with its   
 elegant Hall,peacocks and deer.It is  
 an area of arable farming with fields 
 of cereals,rape and potatoes but which
 also contains disused quarries and    
 mines.The landscape is dominated by   
 the iron bearing ridge to the east of 
 the area.A ridge running from         
 Stamford in the south of Lincolnshire 
 ,northwards until it disappears into  
 the Humber near Whitton.
