		<title>05A Day At School</title>
		<content>  After I have made packed lunches for 
my sister and myself we walk to school.
When I arrive, I play out in the play- 
ground until the bell goes. Then we all
go to our lines. When we go inside the 
teacher does the register, then we go  
to assembly in the hall. The headmaster
says "Good morning everyone" and then  
he tells us a story, after which we    
sing a song.The one I like best is     
"Colours of Day". After that he talks  
to us and then we go back to our class-
room. When we get back we do maths. At 
the moment we are doing averages, which
are quite hard. At l0.40a.m. we go out 
to play. After play we do social       
studies or English. Sometimes we have a
T.V.programme. At ll.55 the bell goes  
for dinnertime. For dinner I have sand-
wiches, a taxi biscuit, a bag of crisps
and a drink. We do more lessons in the 
afternoon and go home at 3.30p.m.      </content>
