		<title>18Braybrooke Church and Chapel</title>
		<content>The two places of worship in Braybrooke
are the Baptist Chapel and All Saints  
Church.On many occasions the two co-   
operate closely running joint          
activities such as Sunday School.As is 
the case in most communities the active
members are a small minority of the    
population though services at Christmas
and Harvest are well supported.The     
Church runs social activities such as  
Harvest Supper.The parish does not have
a resident priest and is served by the 
vicar from Desborough.With a small     
congregation building maintenance is a 
constant problem.The earliest          
identifiable part of the church is the 
Norman font and it contains examples of
all architectural styles used up to the
15th century.                          
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
