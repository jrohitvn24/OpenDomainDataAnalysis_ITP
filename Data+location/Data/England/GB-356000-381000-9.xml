		<content>     The traffic survey gave the       
 following results:_                   
     Travelling towards Daresbury there
 were four cars and one van.           
     Travelling towards Moore on the   
 A56,There were eight cars, three      
 lorries,two vans and one bicycle.     
     Travlling towards Hatton there    
 were six cars and one lorry.          
     We found that the major form of   
 transport was cars. The least form of 
 transport was a bicycle.              
     We later found  that the reason   
 for hardly any bicycles was that      
 there are lots of hills to climb.     
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
