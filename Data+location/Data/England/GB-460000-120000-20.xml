 The houses are mainly built of brick  
 and the cottages of brick and flint.  
 There are three thatched buildings,   
 one barn and two cottages. There are  
 several fine large 18th.century houses
 and some 16th. century cottages.There 
 are 40 group D listed buildings.      
 The church in Corhampton must be the  
 oldest building dated around 1020. The
 walls are plastered whole flints and  
 the corners are made of long and short
 stones typical of Saxon work.
