		<title>04BURHAM - THE GAMEKEEPER</title>
		<content> Burham village is situated at the base
  of the chalk scarp slope of the North
 Downs where  the River Medway cuts    
 through them from South to North. The 
 land around and above the village, to 
 the North and East is owned by the    
 Blue Circle Cement Company. Its use is
 three fold; agricultural farmed by    
 tenant farmers; forestry, controlled  
 by the Forestry Commission; and       
 shooting. Three thousand five hundred 
 acres are controlled by a gamekeeper. 
 We were able to interview him to      
 discover what this unusual job, only 1
 of 3000 in the country, entails.      
 He lives in a lodge on the crest of   
 the Downs in woodland which is not    
 easily accessible by road.
