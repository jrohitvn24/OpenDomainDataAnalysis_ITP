    Lamberhurst is fortunate to have   
 a working{bakery}supplying the        
 surrounding villages.                 
    Mr and Mrs Avard's family have     
 owned the bakery since it was built in
 the 17th century, although part was   
 used as a horse and carriages for hire
 depot.                                
    In the night my dad has to get     
 up at midnight to start baking. He    
 uses six different types of flour to  
 make white bread. He also makes wheat 
 germ, wheat meal, hovis, granary and  
 cakes. The oven temperature has to be 
 between 350 and 460 degrees           
 fahrenheit. Our shop, in the centre   
 of{Lamberhurst,}is open between 8am   
 and 5pm, and provides a wide variety  
 of bread and cakes.
