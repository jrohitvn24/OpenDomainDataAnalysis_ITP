		<title>05The Stather</title>
		<content> The Stather nestles below Burton on   
 the banks of the Trent.'Stather'      
 indicates the Danish connection for it
 is Old Norse meaning 'landing place on
 a river.'There was a ferry service    
 across the river until 1924.This      
 service operated 16 hours a day, seven
 days a week but could be called out in
 an emergency during the night because 
 it was a King's Ferry, a main road.   
 Today this is remembered in the King's
 Ferry Wharf.There was also a packet   
 steamer ferry service which linked    
 Burton with Gainsborough and Hull.    
 During the 2nd World War the Stather  
 was used by soldiers to practise for  
 the Normandy landing.For years the    
 Stather was renowned for boat         
 building.In 1985 it is a thriving     
 wharf bringing trade and employment   
 but the large lorries cause problems  
 in the narrow streets.                </content>
