Within our area are at least two       
examples of depopulated villages: one  
is Ledall, to the north west of        
Waterperry, and the other is in fields 
the south of Thomley Hall Farm.  Both  
may be the subjects of future          
archaeological work.                   
Even during this century, the          
population pattern has altered.  Local 
people remember going to a school on   
Waterperry Common before World War Two,
as well as to the school in the village
of Waterperry.  Neither exists today.  
Part of the area contains what is      
reputed to be the smallest parish in   
England, that of Thomley.  Currently,  
the "parishoners" are organising       
themselves to fight the prospect of the
M40 extension cutting through the area.
