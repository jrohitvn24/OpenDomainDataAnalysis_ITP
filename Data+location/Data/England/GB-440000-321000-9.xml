		<title>09The Old Railway Line Part 2</title>
		<content> ran away without a driver up the line 
 to Chelleston.  About 1 mile from the 
 station a train crashed into          
 them.  Three people were killed on the
 line between 1906 and 1943.  In 1943  
 some American rolling stock ran away  
 down the line to Cloud Hill from      
 Ashby.  At Tonge station in the 1940's
 there was some army tanks  on the     
 train,the engine would'nt stop because
 of the weight and fell over.  On the  
 14th of June 1955 the most serous     
 accident was when 29 wagons ran away  
 from the new Lount Colliery and       
 finished up in Cloud Hill pilled 4    
 trucks high.                          
    The line was eventually closed down
 on 22nd September 1930. There are     
 still lines around Tonge, but the old 
 line has gone, but still the track    
 provides beautiful walks,wildlife and 
 plants.                               </content>
