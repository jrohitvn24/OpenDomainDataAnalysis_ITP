		<title>19TRANSPORT PROBLEMS IN LEVEN</title>
		<content> We went outside and asked some        
 ladies questions. These were the      
 results. Ten out of ten thought that  
 the bus service was poor.             
 I asked them what improvements they   
 would like.These were the results.Four
 out of ten  wanted a railway but they 
 did not specify where to. Three out of
 ten wanted a taxi service.            
 Nine out of ten wanted buses hourly   
 to Beverley and Hull;and ten out of   
 ten wanted a bypass.Our main road gets
 very busy with lorries and tourists   
 going to Bridlington,Scarborough,and  
 Hornsea.Ten out of ten wanted a zebra 
 crossing across the main road;as it   
 often takes several minutes to get    
 from one side of the village to the   
 other.The mothers were worried about  
 the dangerous main road.
