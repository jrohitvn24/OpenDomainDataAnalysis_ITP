		<title>08HOME FARM,BAGENDON.</title>
		<content>  Home farm in Bagendon is about 100   
 years old it is owned by Mr and Mrs   
 Bovil. They have 40 acres of grassland
 and keep about 10 cows, 13 calves and 
 5 horses. The farm has 2 tractors and 
 about 12 farm implements. The calves  
 are bought at{Gloucester cattle market
 and sold when they are 9 months old.  
 Suckling cows are kept to serve the   
 calves, milk is not sold. The cows    
 have one calf each year, these are    
 kept on the farm either to be sold for
 beef if it's a bull calf or for       
 milking if it's female.               
  In the future the Bovils would like  
 to move to a bigger farm where they   
 can keep more cattle.
