		<content> Mr. Partington is the lead bellringer 
 at {St. Lukes'Church.}In the church   
 there are eight {bells.}The largest   
 bell is the tenor, it weighs just over
 one ton, and its width is 1.25m.The   
 longest clapper is one metre long. The
 bells were recast in 1921 by Gillet   
 and Johnston of London, when one of   
 the bells cracked. The bells are made 
 of four parts copper and one part tin.
 They had to lower the bells because it
 was too hard to ring them when they   
 were high up. The clock only has three
 faces because the fourth side is the  
 church. The clock is run by           
 electricity. The tower itself is 202  
 feet high. The first chapel was built 
 in 1552 and stood for 290 years, then 
 a new one was built. When Heywood was 
 a small village, St. Lukes was the    
 main church.
