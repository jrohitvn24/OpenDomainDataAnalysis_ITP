		<title>05Arable Farming &amp; Livestock</title>
		<content>      This is an area of mostly arable 
 farms.  The main crops are{wheat}and  
{barley}and{oil seed rape.}Since the   
 closure, a few years ago, of the      
{British Sugar Corporation Factory}at  
{Felsted,}little sugar beet is grown.  
 Varieties of wheat are grown for      
 bread and some for biscuits and cakes.
 Some farmers are experimenting with   
{durum,}a wheat variety used for pasta.
 Peas and beans are grown as break     
 crops.                                
     {Bovingdon Hall Estate}(pages 3 &amp; 
 4) is particularly interesting because
 of the practice of commercial farming 
 and conservation.                     
     {Abbots Hall}has a very large     
 intensive pig unit of about 2000      
 animals and{Sheering Hall}and{Kilhogs 
{Farm}both have large pig units.       
{Goldsticks Farm}has about 200 sheep   
 and some farms have some beef cattle. </content>
