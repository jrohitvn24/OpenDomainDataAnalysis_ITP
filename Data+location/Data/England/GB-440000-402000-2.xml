		<content> I like watching a lot of television up
 in my bedroom. I like watching        
 adventure films best. I have got two  
 computers and like computer games. My 
 best are Pac Man and Trans Am. I enjoy
 going to the cinema in Barnsley. I    
 collect football books and stickers.  
 Every Sunday my dad washes his car.   
 After he has done that he goes to a   
 gun club for a shoot. He has 2 twelve 
 bore shotguns and an air gun.         
   My mum likes to knit in front of the
 television when she has the time.     
   Every Saturday at 9 o'clock my      
 sister goes horse riding. She has been
 doing this for 5 years and is quite   
 horse mad.                            
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
