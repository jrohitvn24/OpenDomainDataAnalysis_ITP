 people is a cat.{Dogs}are very        
 energetic pets.They need a lot of     
 exercise and cost quite a sum of money
 to keep.The smaller animals are much  
 cheaper to look after.There are       
 animals like {gerbils,hampsters}and   
 even{white mice.}To keep a pet you    
 need a certain number of things to    
 keep it healthy.For a small pet like  
 above ,you need a cage , food and     
 water . For cats and dogs all you need
 is  food , water and a place to sleep.
 Animals,like cats and dogs, need to   
 sleep in a warm place .Cats are       
 usually  left to sleep anywhere but   
 dogs usually sleep in a kennel or in a
 basket.                               </content>
