		<content> Ledbury is a charming town 14 miles   
 east of Hereford. Many old buildings  
 have been retained, including half    
 timbered Tudor houses near the towns  
 centre. There is also a 12c Parish    
 church with a tower from the following
 century and which rises to 202 feet.  
 In the High Street is a 17c market    
 house standing on pillars and the 16c 
 Feathers inn near the cross roads.    
 The town sands on the Worcester       
 Hereford railway line, and has its    
 own station, the A449 runs through as 
 a main road link.                     
 The surrounding area is well wooded,  
 both deciduous and coniferous, and is 
 important for its contribution to the 
 cider industry.
