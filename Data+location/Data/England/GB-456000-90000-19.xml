		<content>   At{breakfast}time our family eats   
 cereal, toast and sometimes a cooked  
 meal of bacon, sausages and eggs. I   
 carry to school a{packed lunch}of     
 fruit, crisps and sandwiches. I have a
{cooked meal}in the evening and on     
 Sunday we have a roast or casserole.  
   When I have a{party}I like savoury  
 foods as well as jelly and ice cream. 
 On{Christmas Day}we have roast turkey 
 and{Christmas}pudding and Mummy makes 
 pancakes on{Shrove Tuesday.}I like to 
 eat fish and chips with a fizzy drink 
 or milk shake when I have a meal in a 
{restaurant.                           
   Many foods are now deep frozen and  
 cooking in a{microwave oven}is much   
 quicker. We grow some fruit and       
 vegetables in our garden but we buy   
 most of our food.
