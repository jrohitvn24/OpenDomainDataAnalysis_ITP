		<title>02The Village of Harberton</title>
		<content> The village consists of about 75 homes
 with a population of around 350       
 people. The houses mostly nestle in,  
 or on the slopes of, the valley of a  
 small stream.                         
 There is a Norman Church and a twelth 
 century public house.                 
 Two large houses and their estates    
 dominated village life and employment 
 until comparatively recently. There   
 are still two working farms within the
 village but today most residents      
 travel outside the area to work. The  
 population therefore tends to be      
 young/middle aged as facilities are   
 few for older people. Today a minority
 were actually born in the area.       
 Even in the village farming is in     
 evidence the cows walking in for      
 milking are a familiar sight and they 
 cannot help but make their mark.
