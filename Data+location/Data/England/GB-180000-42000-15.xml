		<content> Local News items: Week to 26 July 1985
                                       
 Planning: There were several schemes  
 for new developments, which caused    
 objections,like a DIY Superstore on   
 the outskirts of the City; the Mayor  
 called for "No further changes yet",to
 avoid too rapid development of Truro. 
    Recreation: Councillors want more  
 facilities for young people, but      
 granting a full licence to a Wine Bar 
 would encourage teenage drinking.     
   The City Hall: How should it be     
 developed? For recreation? As shops?  
 At present it is a financial burden.  
   Health hazards: Drugs are one of the
 biggest problems, but not as bad as in
 larger urban areas.                   
   Dogs fouling in public places causes
 much concern. The Truro Pro-Dog Group 
 have called for dog toilet facilities.
