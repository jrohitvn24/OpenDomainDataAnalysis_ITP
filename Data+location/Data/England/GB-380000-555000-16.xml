		<content> (cont. from p.15) Friday is my busiest

 a constant stream of customers at my  
 counter wanting all manner of         
 services:Stamps,Postal                
 Orders,Licences,Pensions,Family       
 Allowances,Explorer Bus               
 Tickets,Traveelers Cheques for their  
 holidays to name but a few.Normally   
{12.00}brings asome relief and a break 
 for lunch but alas not today.It is    
 Friday _ Post Office accounting day   
 when all the weeks business has to be 
 added up and accounted for.I have been
 preparing for this all during the week
 but on a friday I take some of the    
 forms and documents upstairs and list 
 them while eating my lunch,which,for  
 ease of preparation is always the same
 on a Friday _ wait for it _ {PIE AND  
{PEAS}and a cup of tea!!!!!!!!!
