		<content> When we went around interviewing      
 people and we found out that most     
 people have transport in the          
 village.The older people don't        
 have transport so some of them use    
 public transport.We asked what public 
 transport they had if they used bus or
 taxi.In our sample all but one had a  
 car.Three older people used the       
 bus.Adults went shopping,to work,to   
 market,on outings and visiting        
 people.We also found out that people  
 that have cars and other transport of 
 their own don't think that public     
 transport is economical.But older     
 people that don't have transport think
 it is economical.I found out that the 
 people that have a car or any other   
 transport use it for mostly           
 shopping.Our conclusion is that       
 children have bikes.Adults 20 to 65   
 have cars and bikes etc.              </content>
