		<title>09A day in my life.</title>
		<content>  A typical day for me starts at 7.00am
 when I am woken by my alarm. I quickly
 wash,dress and brush my hair then find
 my books ready for the lessons that   
 day. I go out the house at 9.00 and   
 arrive at school for 9.10 when the    
 bell goes. I get home from school at  
 3.30pm and watch television. At 4.00 I
 do any homework which finishes at     
 6.00. I then get ready to go out with 
 my friends. We usually go to the      
 telephone box and ring{Talkabout.}This
 is where people between the ages of 13
 and 17 phone other people. You can    
 talk to a person and arrange to meet  
 them if you wish. At about 9.50 we    
 start for home. When I get in I       
 usually watch television again if     
 there is anything good to watch. If   
 there isn't I go to bed.
