		<title>10RECREATION</title>
		<content>  The land on which{Barclay Park}stands
 was donated to Hoddesdon by the       
 Barclay Family in 1871. It was given  
 for the people who were out of work to
 create jobs building the park lake.   
 One of the features of the park that  
 can still be seen today is the line of
 beech trees on the northern boundary  
 called Beech Walk. Part of the        
 original boundary can still be seen in
 Lord Street.                          
  The park is currently a public       
 amenity area in which can be found the
 local football team "Hoddesdon Town", 
 the cricket club "Hoddesdon Colts" and
 the local tennis club.                
  A small part of the park is fenced   
 off as a children's recreational area.
  Hoddesdon also has a squash club.
