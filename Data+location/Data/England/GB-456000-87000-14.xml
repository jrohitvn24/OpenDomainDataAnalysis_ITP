		<title>14Footpaths in the Ashey area</title>
		<content>  Our area contains footpaths and      
 bridleways. There are horses living in
 the area and we found plenty of       
 hoofprints on the downs showing use by
 locals and visitors.                  
  Some of the{local paths}in the North 
 of our area are boggy and seemed      
 little used whereas the paths on the  
 downs were well worn.                 
  The County has just opened a new path
 called the Downs Way.It runs alongside
 the road and joins lots of other      
 paths.                                
  One area currently in{dispute}between
 the landowner and the County is around
 Ashey.The Council wants to rationalise
 the routes near Eagleshead and put a  
 new path up to the seamark from the   
 road.The landowner wants to eradicate 
 all routes near his farm buildings.   
  This year a bridleway along the old  
 railway has been closed.              </content>
