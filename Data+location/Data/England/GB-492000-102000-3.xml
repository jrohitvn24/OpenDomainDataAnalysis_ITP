		<content>    Mrs Barsby has lived in Barnham    
 since 1966, 19 years. She has always  
 lived in the same house which is along
 the main road, Barnham.               
    She ahs seen many changes in       
 Barnham over the years, for example   
 the main shopping area and nearby     
 estate were once a nursery. Sperrings 
 supermarket is now on the site        
 occupied by a large red-bricked house 
 which used to be the nursey           
 offices.The station was built in      
 Barnham, a junction for lines from    
 Brighton, London, Littlehampton and   
 Bognor.                               
    Mrs Barsby has noticed some        
 favourable changes: There are more    
 shops, youth organisations, the Post  
 Office has changed location.
