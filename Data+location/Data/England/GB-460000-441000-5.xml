		<content> We interviewed Mr. Skilbeck,a local   
 farmer,who is also on the Parish      
 Council.He farms over 200 acres in    
 partnership with his brother at Bridge
 Farm and Glebe Farm.They are tenant   
 farmers,renting the land from Mr.     
 Forbes-Adam.Mr. Skilbeck is also the  
 local milkman,and now owns the only   
 dairy herd in our area.At one time    
 most farmers kept dairy cattle. He is 
 afraid that soon doorstep deliveries  
 of milk may be stopped,to conform with
 other EEC countries.He has 200        
 chickens and a herd of 30 Friesian    
 cattle,grazing on 20 acres.His milk is
 taken to Holme on Spalding Moor,and is
 used to make butter,cream and         
 yoghurt,under the brand name of Dale  
 Farm.He sells 7 types of milk,as well 
 as other dairy produce,potatoes and   
 eggs.                                 
                                       </content>
