		<title>19RELIGION IN WEST CAMBS.</title>
		<content>     The only place of worship is St.  
 Botolph's, Stow Longa,which dates from
 the 13th Century.   The church stands 
 among trees on the edge of the        
 village, its secluded position belying
 the fact that the tower was once the  
 highest point in the old County of    
 Huntingdonshire.  St.Botolph's shares 
 a priest with six other parishes in   
 Leightonstone Deanery, in the diocese 
 of Ely, but, nevertheless, a service  
 is held at 11 o'clock each Sunday.    
 Whatever their religious faith, or    
 lack of it, the villagers are proud of
 their church, and money-raising       
 events, such as the annual gymkhana in
 aid of the restoration fund, play an  
 important part in village life.       
     Stow Longa also falls within the  
 boundary of the Roman Catholic parish 
 of Buckden, where two families        
 regularly attend Mass.                </content>
