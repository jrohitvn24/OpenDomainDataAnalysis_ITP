		<title>11My Sunday in Huntley</title>
		<content> On Sunday I arose at 8.00am.and had   
 my breakfast.I had Cornflakes with    
 milk followed by toast.               
 Luke called for me at 9.30am.and we   
 went down to Luke's house to play.    
 When we had finished playing,Luke and 
 I went to Solomons Tump to look at all
 the houses.                           
 We went back to Luke's house to have a
 game of Badminton until lunchtime.    
 Later on,Luke and I played in a willow
 tree.Suddenly Luke fell out of the    
 tree. He said his leg was hurting.We  
 went to Luke's house so his mum could 
 have a look at his leg.I played until 
 9.00pm. and I went to bed at 9.30pm.  
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
