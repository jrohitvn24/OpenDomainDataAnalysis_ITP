 Roman Villa                           
                                       
 This area has been inhabited from     
 Neolithic times and occasional finds  
 are still being made.  The pipe line  
 constructed this year has uncovered   
 Roman traces on Sudeley Hill.  Roman  
 coins were also found in 1882.  The   
 Roman Villa in Spoonley Wood was      
 discovered in 1882.  It may have had  
 as many as forty rooms and a well.  A 
 protective roof was erected over the  
 mosaics but it has collapsed and the  
 site has become overgrown and souvenir
 takers have removed bits of the Villa.
 There are remains on exhibition in    
 Cheltenham Museum.  The Villa occupied
 an area 200ft by 140ft.
