 In the morning we get up and make     
 breakfast for Mum and Dad. Then Dad   
 gets up and feeds the cattle and      
 sheep. He goes to Bradley which is a  
 farm with about 85 acres of land.     
 After dinner we go to Sunday School   
 where we sing hymns and choruses and  
 then have a Bible story read to us in 
 another room. Then at 3 o'clock the   
 service starts and we have hymns,     
 Bible readings and prayers. At 4      
 o'clock the service finishes and we go
 out and leave the older ones in the   
 Chapel to talk. At about 5 o'clock we 
 are called to get in the car and go   
 home. At home we have our tea, play   
 for a little while and go to bed.
