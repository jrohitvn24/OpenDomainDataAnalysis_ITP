 The area is part of the "Green Belt"  
 which surrounds London. Therefore     
 planning permission is strict and any 
 building on new land is rare.         
 Aldbury has many old properties some  
 of which have remained unaltered for  
 hundreds of years. The centre of the  
 village around the pond is an area of 
 outstanding beauty and is subject of  
 much interest by film and television  
 companies.
