		<content>   At West Ashey Farm there are 2      
 Hereford bulls.The cows are{Limousin, 
{Charollais, and Friesians.}           
  In one of the sheds there are 30 cows
 and a calf which was not even a day   
 old. After 4 days, the calf will leave
 its mother and be weaned onto a       
 machine that was only built today. The
 machine is like an artificial mother; 
 it has 3 teats which the calves suck  
 to get milk.                          
   The farmers keep the cows for{milk, 
{beef and breeding.}When the cows are  
 sold they weigh around 10 hundred     
 weight(about 500kg).The farmers have  
 to keep two different types of grazing
 land.This is because the cows like    
 long grass and the sheep like short   
 grass.                                
   At the farm there are two injured   
{racehorses}, called Pitlochry &amp; John  
 Willoughby (both are 16.2 hands high).</content>
