		<title>03Ecology in Whitley</title>
		<content> As Whitley is a WHITEBELT area the    
 natural life in and around it, is very
 healthy. Foxes,badgers,rabbits &amp; hares
 can be seen at dusk and dawn hopping  
 and leaping about in the fields. Blue-
 bells, Cowparsley &amp; Shepherd's Purse  
 grow abundantly on the narrow sides of
 Whitleys quiet country lanes.There are
 hundreds of different kinds of birds  
 in Whitley ranging from wrens to owls 
 &amp; also there are  a few ducks  &amp; water
 birds. Most families have pets such as
 cats, dogs, hamsters, gerbils, guinea-
 pigs &amp; horses.  On farms we have cows 
 ,pigs, chickens &amp; sheep.  There is a  
 nature conservation trust in our area 
 and several of our villagers are part 
 of it.  The land is a sandy loam with 
 small ponds and woods for wildlife and
 the farm land is mainly grass for milk
 and grazing and there is some arable  
 land for corn, roots and potatoes.    </content>
