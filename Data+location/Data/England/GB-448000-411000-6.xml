		<content> On 3.7.85 we visited Wrangbrook Sewage
 Works.This is a small works,employing 
 two men,Bob and Phil Senior.They are  
 brothers.They like their job.The works
 cleans all the waste from Upton,about 
 500,000 litres a day.The job that Phil
 and Bob do is simple.They make dirty  
 water clean again.To do this there are
 many stages.First the waste passes    
 through the {Primary Stage,}where the 
 solid material is screened.The {Solid 
{Waste Tank}is emptied twice a day,the 
 waste being placed on drying beds     
 where it hardens in 4 to 5 days.Once  
 hardened it is moved from here.The    
 water is pumped into {Humus Tanks.}   
 Here the water is cleaned by{bacteria,
 which only live  for 15 minutes.The   
 bacteria eat the dirt in the water.Now
 about {250,000}litres of the water is 
 pumped into the stream called {The    
{Skell.}                               </content>
