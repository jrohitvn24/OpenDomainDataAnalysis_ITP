		<title>17   The Unionist Club.</title>
		<content> We interviewed the chairman.He told   
 us that skittles and drinking were    
 popular activities.People go to the   
 club for a drink and a chat,sometimes 
 bringing a guest who hopefully may    
 decide to join.They have a few plans  
 for the future,to have gas central    
 heating built in and to have the rooms
 redecorated.The hall is used          
 for wedding receptions and parties.   
          Sometime in the year the     
 blood donors come and use the hall    
 as a hospital to take blood.          
          The back of the club is      
 grassed and this is used for bowls    
 and other outdoor activities.         
          One interesting fact         
 concerning membership is that members 
 should also belong to the Conservative
 Club.Whether all members actually vote
 Conservative is another matter.
