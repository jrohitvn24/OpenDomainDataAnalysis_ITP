		<title>07Pets: My Canary</title>
		<content>{My canary} is now yellow after being a
sandy colour at birth. He is about     
14cm in length. His beak is a brown    
colour. He is kept in a cage in the    
front room by the window. We never let 
him out becuase he will not go back in 
the cage. At night I cover his cage    
with a big tea towel. In the morning I 
uncover the cage. As soon as I open    
the curtains he chirps. He will eat    
bird grit and a mixture of seeds.      
Sometimes we treat him to a honey bell 
which he likes a lot. A honey bell is  
is a bell made from honey and a variety
of seeds. I clean him out twice a week 
three times if necessary. When I clean 
him out I am careful not to let him    
escape.
