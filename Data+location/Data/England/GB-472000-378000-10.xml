		<title>10THE GROVE HUNT.</title>
		<content> The Grove Hunt is an independent pack 
 of hounds with a history going back   
 into the 19th century.It amalgamated  
 with the Rufford Hunt in 1957.The     
 present kennels are at Barnby Moor.The
 Grove 'country' extends well beyond   
 the Grove area,from the River Trent in
 the East to the A614 in the West.It   
 reaches to Newark in the South and    
 Epworth in the North. This 'country'  
 used to provide the original extended 
 packs with six days a week hunting.The
 construction of the M1,A1 and M18     
 motorways have now made it possible to
 hunt only two days a week.            
 The Hunt  now meets on Tuesdays and   
 Saturdays during the main part of the 
 season.The season is from the last    
 Tuesday in October until the middle of
 March. Cub Hunting takes place between
 the beginning of September until the  
 end of October.                       </content>
