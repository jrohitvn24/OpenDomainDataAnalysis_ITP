		<content> Housing in this area varies from large
 manor house style through semidetached
 to terraced dwellings.The four larger 
 houses standing in their own grounds  
 make an attractive feature. Fifteen   
 farmhouses are scattered over the     
 landscape. Some are owner occupied    
 others have tenant farmers. Two of the
 houses have been built this century   
 others much earlier. Detached houses  
 generally have four or more upper     
 rooms and two bathrooms or one        
 bathroom and a shower room. Some have 
 an annexe or flat in the grounds to   
 accommodate relatives  in need of     
 help. Most of the other houses are    
 three  bedroomed semi-detached some of
 which are council owned.
