		<content>  The villages of Hullavington and     
 Lower Stanton St.Quintin are situated 
 between Chippenham and Malmesbury on  
 the Southern end of the Cotswold      
 Hills.The highest point of the area is
 over 107 metres above sea level.The   
 ground is gently undulating and is    
 highest in the South West corner.It is
 crossed by 3 small streams which flow 
 Eastwards into the River Avon.One of  
 them is called the Gauze Brook.The    
 most distinctive buildings are the    
 hangars on the R.A.F.Camp.Most of the 
 village buildings are roofed and      
 constructed with Jurassic oolitic     
 limestone.Also near The C             
 amp there is a little wood which is   
 called Stock Wood.There is more grass 
 around the concrete runway than the   
 actual concrete.
