		<title>15POLICE STATION/COURT BROUGH</title>
		<content> There has been a police station and   
 court in Brough since 1900. It was    
 closed down for a short time, but     
 re_opened in 1973 in its present form.
 The Court sits for two sessions on    
 Mondays for traffic offences,         
 Wednesdays for crimes,_ and Fridays   
 for juvenile and domestic cases,      
 dealing with approximately 8,000 cases
 annually. Serious crimes are referred 
 to the Crown Courts at Beverley or    
 York, and convicted offenders with    
 jail sentences are sent to Leeds Gaol 
 for men, or Durham Gaol for women.Once
 a motorist was fined for a traffic    
 offence which he could not afford to  
 pay. He brought a calf, complete with 
 water and feed, to the Court in lieu  
 of payment.  Fortunately, from the    
 resulting publicity,, the fine was    
 paid in cash by a well_wisher.
