		<content>{STOCK:}This is basically a sheep and  
 beef cattle area.Small upland farms   
 rear stock, fattened on the marsh in  
 summer.There are now more sheep than  
 cattle,mostly Kent sheep, sometimes   
 crossed Dorset Down.Formerly were sold
 as fat lambs or 'hoggets' at 1 year.  
 There is more stock  to the acre than 
 say 40 years ago.Greatest change in   
 animal husbandry since 1945 is the    
 vast increase in{veterinary knowledge 
 and resultant improved health of      
 animals.                              
{CROPS:}Plant breeding techniques and  
 impetus in research have              
 revolutionised the business of ley    
 farming.                              
{MECHANISATION}may not have improved   
 the method of farm husbandry but has  
 replaced expensive labour, man.Some of
 the heart and character of farming has
 gone with him.                        </content>
