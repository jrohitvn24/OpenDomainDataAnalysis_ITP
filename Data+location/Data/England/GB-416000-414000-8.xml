		<content>{Sykes and Tunnicliffe}was founded in  
 1898. Now in Almondbury it is a large 
 producer of woven fireside rugs. It   
 employs fewer people now (42) due to  
 modernisation. Although some employees
 are local people, more come from      
 outside the area than in the past.    
                                       
{Gelpack}opened in 1981 and now employs
 138 full-time and 17 part-time. They  
 work 8 hours a day (40 hours weekly). 
 The factory makes disposable household
 plastic bags, e.g. those sold in      
 supermarkets. Much of the manufacture 
 is done by machines.                  
                                       
{Standard Fireworks}now make flares for
 farmers. These are on long lengths of 
 rope. At night the farmer lights the  
 rope and it burns at a steady rate.   
 Then, at dawn, a flare is set off.    
 This scares off the birds.            </content>
