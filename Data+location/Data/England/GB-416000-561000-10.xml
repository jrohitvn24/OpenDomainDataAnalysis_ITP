		<title>10WINLATON'S COMMUNITY CENTRE</title>
		<content> The WINLATON COMMUNITY CENTRE was     
 built in 1973. It is made of brick and
 has an odd shape of modern design.    
 There are seven rooms altogether.  The
 main hall,  the television room,  a   
 shop,  a games room,  and a small room
 which is used for a variety of        
 activities.We completed one hundred   
 questionnaires about the community    
 centre.  62% said it was worth having.
 55% had used it at some time,  24%    
 used it weekly,  28% used it          
 occasionally and 3% used it monthly.  
 Activities available include the Youth
 Club,  Karate,  Gymnastics,  Films,   
 Concerts,  Badminton and a            
 Playgroup.The centre is also used for 
 blood donor sessions. I think it is   
 worth having because I used to go to  
 the Youth Club.
