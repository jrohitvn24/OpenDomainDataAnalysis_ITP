		<content> IN STURMINSTER MARSHALL HOUSES ARE    
 BEING BUILT AND THE VILLAGE IS GETTING
 BIGGER AND BIGGER BUT THERE ARE STILL 
 LOTS OF FIELDS AROUND US. SOME HOUSES 
 ARE STILL STANDING TODAY AND THEY     
 WERE BUILT HUNDREDS OF YEARS AGO.TODAY
 THE HOUSES ARE BUILT OF TWO WALLS OF  
 BRICK WITH A SPACE BETWEEN THEM THIS  
 IS A CAVITY WALL. THE INSIDE WALLS ARE
 BUILT OF BLOCKS.INSIDE SOME HOUSES ARE
 DAMP AND MOULDY BUT MOST PEOPLE NOW   
 HAVE CENTRAL HEATING OR ELECTRIC      
 COOKERS BUT SOME PEOPLE STILL USE A   
 COAL FIRED OVEN LIKE A RAYBURN. ALMOST
 ALL HOMES HAVE TELEVISION SETS AND    
 MANY HAVE VIDEO RECORDERS.SOME PEOPLE 
 HAVE SMALL BATHROOMS BUT THERE ARE FEW
 HOUSES WITHOUT BATHROOMS.
