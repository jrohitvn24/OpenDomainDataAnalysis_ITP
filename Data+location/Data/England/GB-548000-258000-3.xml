		<content>         As the Cambridge City boundary
 crosses this area one finds distinct  
 differences in the types of housing.  
 To the east, in the city, is a council
 built 'satellite' estate with a       
 mixture of terraced and semi detached 
 "council houses" rented by working    
 families, plus a few rented by retired
 couples.                              
 To the north and south one finds two  
 villages in a contrasting rural       
 setting. Teversham, in the south, is a
 very small village with varied mixture
 of architecture. A few very old white 
 washed thatched cottages of the       
 'wattle and daub' constuction to the  
 large,detached modern house, with all 
 the modern comforts.In the heart of   
 this small village one finds the      
 terraced cottages constructed of the  
 local brick at the time of building.
