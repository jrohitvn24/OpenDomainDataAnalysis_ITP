		<title>04Wild Flowers in Chadderton</title>
		<content>   We found some derelict buildings and
 loads of Rosebay Willowherb which has 
 a pink flower. Everywhere you go you  
 find stinging nettles. When you walk  
 along the streets you find Lady's     
 Smock. The common name is Cuckoo      
 Flower. It grows out of the cracks in 
 the pavement. On the Golf Links there 
 were four different flowers found,    
 Coltsfoot, Meadow Buttercup, Clover   
 and Daisy. In gardens there are always
 weeds. One weed that is hard to get   
 rid of is Dandelion. There is a river 
 in our area and near that Field       
 Horsetail can be found.
