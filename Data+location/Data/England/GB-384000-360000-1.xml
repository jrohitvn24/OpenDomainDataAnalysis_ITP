		<content> Congleton is a small town of around   
 25,000 INHABITANTS in South East      
 Cheshire.Granted a charter in 1272 it 
 is a market town with excellent       
 amenities.                            
 Communications around the Congleton   
 area are of a reasonable standard with
 both rail and road links to other     
 parts of the country.                 
 Surrounding Congleton itself there are
 extensive areas of grazing landwith   
 small villages scattered nearby.Some  
 of this agricultural land has in      
 recent years been built upon.         
 The area has traditionally looked     
 toward the textile INDUSTRY to be the 
 major source of employment.Also the   
 area has developed into a commuter    
 belt for nearby Manchester. Housing is
 mixed,ranging from council estates to 
 older type terraces.The area presents 
 a varied and diverse landscape.       </content>
