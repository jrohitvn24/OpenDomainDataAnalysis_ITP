		<title>16Ashchurch Church</title>
		<content> Opposite to our school is the Parish  
 Church of St. Nicholas, Ashchurch,    
 which was begun about 1150 A.D. A     
 large porch was added in Tudor times. 
 Inside the church there is a long thin
 nave with outward sloping walls which 
 remind  one of a ship.The chancel is  
 separated from the nave by an wooden  
 rood screen.On the north side of the  
 nave, a row of arches shows where the 
 original wall was before the church   
 was enlarged. In the church there is  
 an  organ which came from the Manor   
 House at Fiddington.Years ago the     
 walls were covered with bright        
 pictures.Before the present church was
 built there was a Saxon church on the 
 same site. There are still some of the
 original stones surviving today such  
 as a carved fish and some herringbone 
 masonry.Even in summer you can feel   
 very cold in the church.              </content>
