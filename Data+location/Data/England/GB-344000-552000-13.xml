		<content>   We continued our talk with the old  
 lady from Great Corby.                
   The River Eden is crossed from      
 Wetheral to Great Corby by a viaduct  
 carrying the railway line.There is a  
 footpath which runs alongside the     
 track.In her younger days one could   
 use this footpath by paying 1/2d.For  
 the same price you could cross by     
 ferry.No payment was required on a    
 Sunday if one was walking across the  
 viaduct to the church in Wetheral.    
 Coffins were put on a flat bogey and  
 pushed across to the church.Roads to  
 outlying farms were poor so corpses   
 were brought along the valleys by the 
 becks.bearers rested the coffins on   
 flat stones called "Coffin Stones."   
 There is a coffin stone in the        
 playground of Great Corby School.     
   This lady gardens,recently built a  
 wall and is knitting for Famine Relief</content>
