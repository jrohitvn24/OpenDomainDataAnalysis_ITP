		<content>                                       
 Hockley is next to Rayleigh and       
 Hawkwell. In Hockley there is a       
 mixture of new and old housing, it has
 quiet and noisey roads.               
 There are quite a few places to shop, 
 including banks, supermarkets,        
 butchers and takeaways.               
 Hockley has a new school that was     
 built in 1983, it has several pubs,one
 library, one fire station and a       
 railway station.                      
 Hockley is a hilly place it has a wood
 with walks  and swings for the        
 children. Some people say Hockley is a
 friendly place and people like to walk
 in the nearby fields, especially when 
 the corn is ripe.                     
 Hockley has an attractive church,     
 called St. Peters and St. Pauls.      
 We enjoy living in Hockley because    
 people are very neighbourly.          </content>
