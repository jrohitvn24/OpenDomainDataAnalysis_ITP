		<title>12A SUBURBAN WEEKEND.</title>
		<content> Many people do jobs at the weekend    
 that they don't do during the week.   
 For example, I sometimes do a bit of  
 gardening. My mother might help,      
 whereas my father will just lie down  
 on the settee, read the paper and     
 watch the television.                 
 Every Saturday my whole family goes   
 shopping in the Bexleyheath shopping  
 centre. We go into Sainsbury's to do  
 our main shopping for the week. When  
 it comes to D.I.Y. at home, nobody is 
 really interested. In the end my      
 grand-dad does the odd-jobs. He's     
 retired now so he has a lot of spare  
 time. Most of our family has a hobby. 
 My dad loves reading books, my mum    
 likes relaxing in the garden and I    
 like collecting stamps and reading. So
 as you see our family does lots of    
 things it does not do during the week.
 There must be many families like ours.</content>
