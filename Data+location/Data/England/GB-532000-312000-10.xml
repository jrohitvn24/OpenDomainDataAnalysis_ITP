		<title>10HEALTH IN HOLBEACH DROVE</title>
		<content> HEALTH IS OF CONCERN IN ALL SITUATIONS
 BUT IN THE OPEN COUNTRYSIDE FOUND     
 AROUND HOLBEACH DROVE AND FLEET FEN   
 THERE ARE ALOT OF HOMES WHICH ARE     
 ISOLATED AND WHERE MANY OLD FOLK LIVE 
 AND HAVE TO BE CARED FOR. AS FOUND IN 
 THE AREA, PEOPLE TEND TO LOOK AFTER   
 THEIR OLD FOLK AND MAKE SURE THEY ARE 
 WELL CARED FOR AND IF THEY ARE NOT    
 SEEN SOMEONE WILL NOTICE. IF DOCTORS  
 ARE REQUIRED THEY HAVE TO COME OUR    
 FROM THE PRACTICE AT CROWLAND WHERE   
 TWO DOCTORS HOLD SURGERIES. A CHEMIST 
 IS NEXT DOOR TO ONE OF THE SURGERIES  
 AND HE STAYS OPEN UNTIL THE DOCTOR HAS
 ENDED HIS PRACTICE FOR THE DAY. SOME  
 PRESCRIPTIONS ARE SENT TO THE LOCAL   
 POST OFFICE IN WHAPLODE DROVE TO      
 ENABLE PEOPLE TO GET THEIR TABLETS ETC
 WITHOUT HAVING TO GO TO               
 CROWLAND.SURGERY IS ALSO HELD IN      
 HOLBEACH/ WHAPLODE.DENTISTS ARE LOCAL.</content>
