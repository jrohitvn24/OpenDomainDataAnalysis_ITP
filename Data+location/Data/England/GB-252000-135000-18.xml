		<title>18MARWOOD S. A TYPICAL DAY</title>
		<content>    Simon my brother has got up at 7am.
 while I lie in bed for an extra half  
 hour because I cycle to school and he 
 has to catch the school bus to        
 Braunton before me.I get dressed and  
 eat a typical breakfast of cornflakes,
 tea and toast.Then I wash and clean my
 teeth with a toothbrush,put my coat on
 and ride to school.I leave home about 
 8.20am.At school we have playtime     
 until the bell and then go in for     
 register.Next we have silent reading  
 maths then half an hour playtime.After
 that it's usually writing.We eat      
 dinner at school and then play. We do 
 art,sport and music and put up our    
 chairs at the end of the day.I cycle  
 home,change clothes,have a cup of tea,
 watch TV and go out to play.          
 ,
