		<title>02BURTON SALMON SUBSIDENCE</title>
		<content>   The worst case of subsidence in     
 Brotherton is Mill Farm, which is just
 before the A1 and the end of our      
 area. The trouble is coming from      
 Glasshoughton Colliery and the shaft  
 is only 200ft down so it is a shallow 
 mine. Between the Christmas of 1983   
 and now, it has gone down 6-10ft. The 
 barns and the farmhouse are in a state
 of collapse and are going to be       
 knocked down next week before they    
 fall down. Belmont Council Estate is  
 also going to be knocked down, partly 
 because of subsidence. The slip road  
 onto the A1 has cracks 1cm wide and 1m
 deep. At the same site an 11,000 volt 
 electric cable has bent. A bridge     
 30ft above ground level has also      
 suffered and has been repaired.
