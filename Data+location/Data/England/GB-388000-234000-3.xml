		<title>03Customs of Twyning Green</title>
		<content>    Years ago there was a{fairground}  
 held on the green every{Trinity       
{Monday,}the children had a day off    
 school to go to the fair. At the fair 
 the{heavy machinery}was pulled by     
{steam engines}but{horses}pulled the   
 smaller wagons. When the horses wanted
 to graze they were not allowed on the 
 green, so their owners had to pay 2d  
 per horse to rent a field.            
    All the houses which surround the  
 green face inwards. The reason for    
 this is that the people could keep    
 their animals on the green and keep an
 eye on them.                          
    Many years ago children used it for
 a{playground.}Now it is used for      
{fetes, horse riding}and{football      
 matches. The children still use it as 
 a playground though. People also use  
 it as a{picnic area,}or they just sit 
 on the benches and admire the view.   </content>
