 Thorp's plantation, consisting of     
 30.92 acres was sold for Â£1 in 1932.  
 It is now owned by Manor Farm,        
 Winestead consisting mainly of Ash,   
 Oak, Sycamore, Alder, Chestnut, Wild  
 Cherry and Scotch Pine trees.  All Elm
 trees have been felled because of     
 Dutch Elm disease.  Rabbits, foxes,   
 pheasants and deer all roam freely.   
 Part of Thorp's plantation is "Thorp's
 pond", being 0.32 acres with ducks and
 heron to be seen.  Also sighted are   
 red shanks, woodpecker and sandpipers.
 The owners of Manor Farm are          
 purchasing Westfield plantation, which
 actually joins Thorp's plantation,    
 being 10.18 acres of conifers.  On    
 24th June 1984 a Preservation Order   
 was placed on the Westfield plantation
 preventing anyone from felling trees. </content>
