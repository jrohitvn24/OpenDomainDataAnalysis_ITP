		<title>14SOCIAL CONCERNS - TRAFFIC</title>
		<content>                                       
  ONE OF THE MAIN SOCIAL CONCERNS OF   
 THE PEOPLE WE CONSULTED WAS THE       
 TRAFFIC CONGESTION ON THE BUSY A3.    
 THEY FOUND THE PROBLEM TO BE AT ITS   
 WORST DURING THE MORNING AND EVENING  
 RUSH HOURS, 8-9AM, AND 4-6PM, AND     
 DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS WHEN HOLIDAY 
 TRAFFIC ADDS TO THE CONGESTION. THE   
 PROBLEM HAS BEEN FURTHER AGGRAVATED BY
 THE INCREASED USE OF PORTSMOUTH AS A  
 CROSS CHANNEL PORT. HEAVY CONTINENTAL 
 LORRIES ARE A FREQUENT SIGHT GRINDING 
 UP THE A3 THROUGH HINDHEAD.           
  WHILE MANY LOCAL RESIDENTS COMPLAINED
 ABOUT THE PROBLEM THERE WAS NO CLEAR  
 CONSENSUS AS TO WHICH OF THE MANY ROAD
 IMPROVEMENT SCHEMES SHOULD BE ADOPTED.
 THERE IS MUCH CONCERN THAT ANY ROAD   
 IMPROVEMENT PROGRAMME WOULD INEVITABLY
 DESTROY A LARGE AREA OF THE ADJACENT  
 COMMONLAND AND THE BEAUTY OF THE AREA.</content>
