		<title>03SCHOOL GARDEN</title>
		<content>    At the Down School, we have school 
{garden plots,}tended by a group of us.
 We bring our own plants and look after
 them.

    In our garden we have snap-dragons,
 pinks, strawberries, jasmine and a    
 grape vine. Last year this had small  
 grapes, but they weren't fit to eat.  
     Another garden plot has its own   
{pond,}with water lilies and plants in 
 it, as well as two goldfish at        
 present.                              
     At the end of the school-year, Mr.
 Vincent judges the{best kept garden,  
 and there is a prize for that group.  
 Also, we are having a{sunflower }     
{competition}this year to see who can  
 grow the tallest one.                 
      The{weather}has been bad for     
 sunflowers, and the pigeons have      
 taken quite a few.                    </content>
