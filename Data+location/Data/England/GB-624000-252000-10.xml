		<title>10Industry in Bredfield</title>
		<content>     There is a forge in Bredfield     
where originally a blacksmith worked   
mending farm machinery and shoeing     
horses. Nowadays the company makes     
ornamental metalwork such as gates,    
fire guards, coffee tables, foot       
scrapers and brackets for hanging      
baskets of flowers. Their gates have   
been sent to twenty one countries all  
over the world as far away as          
Australia. They have made all the gates
for the Queen's estate at Sandringham, 
and made a foot scraper as a wedding   
present for the Prince and Princess of 
Wales. To celebrate the coronation of  
Queen Elisabeth the Second the Forge   
made an ornamental signpost round the  
pump which is in the middle of a fork  
in the road at one end of Bredfield.   
The Forge also makes ladders and does a
great deal of metal repair work at the 
American Air Force bases.              </content>
