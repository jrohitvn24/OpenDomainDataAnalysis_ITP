		<content>Jim and Ruth KingÂ£s little boy,James,  
has had a very feverish cold throughout
the night and so Ruth is writing this  
report today as she is too tired to    
paint the ceiling coving.An ex-pupil   
arrived to say that she was now working
for Dover CustomÂ£s Office.JimÂ£s uncle  
Fred has been living with Ruth and Jim 
and he has been landscaping the garden.
However,he has gone into Dover today as
June has been so wet and cold that much
outside work has come to a halt.       
Jim and Ruth hope that the weather will
be much better next Wednesday when the 
church will be holding a barbecue.They 
intend to make preparations for the    
event this weekend.They are not sure   
whether this wiil be possible because  
James has been ill during the day.He   
has been crying a great deal and Ruth  
has had to give her full attention to  
him.                                   </content>
