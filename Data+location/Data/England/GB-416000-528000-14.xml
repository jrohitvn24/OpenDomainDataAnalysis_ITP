		<content> The school draws its pupils from the  
 parishes of Ferryhill, Crook, Shildon,
 Willington, Tow Law, Aycliffe, Bishop 
 Auckland and Spennymoor and nearby    
 villages. In the area of the survey   
 both St. Chad's, Witton Park and St.  
 Wilfred's send their juniors on to    
 St. John's at 11.                     
    The school became comprehensive in 
 the 1970s. Falling rolls have prompted
 discussions about its future and that 
 of Carmel RC Comprehensive School at  
 Darlington.                           
    Most of the pupils travel by       
 contract bus to school and a typical  
 scene at the end of the school day is 
 the sight of the convoy of special    
 buses pulling out of the car park.    
    The school has about 800 pupils and
 about 48 staff and caters for 11 to 18
 year olds including a sixth form. The 
 school day is from 9am until 3.35pm.  </content>
