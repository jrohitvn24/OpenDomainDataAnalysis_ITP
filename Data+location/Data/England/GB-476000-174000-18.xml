		<title>18Living in Charvil.</title>
		<content> I live down Milestone Avenue in       
 Charvil near St Patricks stream and   
 opposite some of the farm fields.In   
 the spring the fields have a strong   
 smell of manure.                      
   In summer it is very warm and the   
 smell of manure has mostly gone away  
 and the smell of flowers has come.Mum 
 usually sun bathes in summer, dad     
 does the gardening ,Julian sprays     
 himself with a hose and I go and play 
 with my friend.                       
   In autumn  the leaves go red, yellow
 and a lightish brown then fall of as  
 usual.We like to play in them.        
   In winter it is very good because   
 when the road ices up we go           
 tobogganing down the hill and when it 
 snows we make massive snowmen in the  
 garden.
