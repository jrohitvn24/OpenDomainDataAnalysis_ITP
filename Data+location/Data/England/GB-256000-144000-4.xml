		<content>  We have a set of apparatus in the    
 infants playground and some           
 hopscotches. We have a book shop that 
 sells  all kinds of things.Thats on a 
 Tuesday. Each class  swims every day  
 for 30 minutes.The pool is heated but 
 needs repairing.A committee has been  
 set up to raise Â£2,500 for repairs.   
 Nearly Â£700 has been raised by pupils 
 from a sponsored swim,disco and other 
 activities.We have 2 sports sheds     
 where we keep all kinds of things     
 in.We mostly use the pitch for        
 rounders and for football.Today on    
 Monday 8th July 1985 we have French-  
 man in our school trying to inprove   
 his English.His name is Pierre he is  
 very nice.He played rounders with us. 
 He had never played rounders before   
 and                                   
 he scored two rounders.We also have a 
 computer in the bottom building.      </content>
