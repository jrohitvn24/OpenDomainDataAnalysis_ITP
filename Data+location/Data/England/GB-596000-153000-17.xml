		<title>17LOCAL RADIO IN THROWLEY</title>
		<content>  The local radio stations that serve  
 Throwley are Radio Kent (BBC) and the 
 independent Invicta Radio.            
  They serve the local community with  
 local news and events, advice on      
 weather and road conditions, and      
 provide a forum for individuals and   
 groups with particular interests.     
 Throwley school made use of the       
 "snowline" service in January 1985    
 when severe weather closed the school.
  Throwley school also sought the use  
 of Radio Kent in its quest for        
 information for the Domesday Project. 
 The whole school was invited to the   
 studios in Chatham on the 8th July to 
 take part in Barbara Sturgeon's       
 current affairs programme. We watched 
 the local news being broadcast and    
 then talked about our Domesday work   
 live on the air. We asked people with 
 useful information to contact us.     </content>
