		<content>  Life in the home was very different  
85 years ago. Children had to help     
their parents a great deal. One of     
their many jobs was to get sticks for  
the fire which was the only source of  
heat and also used to cook over.       
  They had to collect water from one   
of the pumps, as piped water was not   
introduced until the Second World War. 
  Monday was a very busy day for all   
the family, as it was wash day.  This  
meant the copper had to be filled, and 
the fire kept going underneath to heat 
the water. Heavy irons had to be kept  
warm to press the clothes when they    
were dry. The normal chores of the day 
still had to be carried out.           
  People in general, worked very hard  
in those days as there was none of the 
modern machinery we take so for granted
today to help us with our chores.
