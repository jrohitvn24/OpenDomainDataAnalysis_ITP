		<title>16LEVERTON FIRE STATION</title>
		<content> Leverton fire station was built in    
 Leverton because no_one in other      
 villages would run it.The crew is made
 up of 10 men. There should be 12      
 firemen altogether.The fire station is
 57 years old.The tower is for drying  
 the hoses.The old hoses are canvas but
 the new hoses are duralone.The siren  
 in the tower is used as a flood       
 warning now.When they are called out  
 they have an alert to let them know.  
 They all like the job and are not     
 scared.The names of the crew          
 are:ROGER,RAY,JOHN,MELVIN,ALAN,ROBIN, 
 IVOR,HAROLD and PETER.They practice at
 Sauls farm and Boston.They clean the  
 fire engine after being out on        
 call.They all like the job because    
 it's worthwhile.All the calls go to   
 Lincoln.
