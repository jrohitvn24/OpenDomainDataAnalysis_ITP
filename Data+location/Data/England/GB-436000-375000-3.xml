		<title>03COMMUNITY POLICEMAN,UNSTONE.</title>
		<content>{P.C. Insley}lives in Unstone &amp; has    
 been Community Policeman for two      
 years.                                
    "I work in the Unstone area &amp;      
 Apperknowle &amp; Handley, mainly using a 
 push-bike.Some years ago the          
 authorities decided a bobby on a bike 
 was old-fashioned. They put all the   
 policemen in cars. We'd hardly any    
 time to talk to anyone. So we've gone 
 back to the old system.               
    "My job is mainly to show my       
 presence.People come up &amp; talk to me. 
 I get complaints from older people    
 about children being pests, running   
 through gardens etc. Then I make sure 
 I'm at that place at the relevent     
 time. I do a 40 hr. week. Every month 
 I go to Council meetings, &amp; they say  
 there are fewer complaints. It seems  
 to be working. I think we'll be doing 
 it for some time."                    </content>
