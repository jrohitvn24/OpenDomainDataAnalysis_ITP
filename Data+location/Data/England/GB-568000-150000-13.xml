 In Yalding live two personalities     
 whose work is of major national       
 importance. Mr Peter Huntingford, MD  
 FRCOG, has recently written "Birth    
 Right, The Parents' Choice", published
 by the British Broadcasting           
 Corporation to accompany the second   
 showing of the TV series which        
 featured Mr Huntingford. In 1965 the  
 youngest person to hold a professor-  
 ship in obstetrics and gynaecology, Mr
 Huntingford is deeply interested in   
 groups who are fighting for the rights
 of mothers-to-be and he has for many  
 years been an adviser to the National 
 Childbirth Trust. Dr Audrey Livingston
 Booth, whose initiative and work saw  
 the setting up of the Stress          
 Foundation, has recently had published
 a book on the subject of stress       
 entitled "Stressmanship".             </content>
