		<title>14FELTWELL PARISH COUNCIL</title>
		<content>   The Parish Council is elected every 
 three years. We have thirteen         
 councillors in all. Eleven represent  
 Feltwell Ward and two represent Anchor
 Ward. The council is elected to       
 represent the people of Feltwell, to  
 administer all business in the very   
 best interest of the parish as a      
 whole. Many different topics are      
 discussed each month. The regular     
 issues that come up concern planning  
 applications. The Parish Council make 
 their observations known to the West  
 Norfolk Borough Council and they      
 decide whether it's to be approved or 
 refused. Another item that is         
 regularly discussed is the condition  
 of the highways. We have to report pot
 holes, flooding, bad pathways and road
 signs. Norfolk County Council are     
 responsible for cutting grass verges, 
 especially the corners of side roads. </content>
