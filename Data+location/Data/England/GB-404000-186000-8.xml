		<title>08Recreation Around Braydon</title>
		<content> The fields and woods around Braydon   
 provide ample opportunities for       
 recreation.                           
    For walkers and riders on horseback
 there is a good network of footpaths  
 and bridleways. There is also a quiet 
 cycleway.                             
    The local youth groups enjoy       
 camping holidays dureing the summer   
 months. The local woods provide fuel  
 for the fires.                        
    Fox-hunting and other blood sports 
 are the recreations pursued in the    
 country areas. There is no problem of 
 limited space in this area and the    
 houses generally have large gardens.  
 Gardening is therefore a popular      
 recreation. Many households are       
 self-sufficient in vegetables. The    
 main vegetables grown are root crops, 
 beans, salad crops and onions.
