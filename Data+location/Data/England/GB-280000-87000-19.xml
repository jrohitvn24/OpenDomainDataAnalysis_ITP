		<title>19CHILD'S POEM  MY PUPPY</title>
		<content> I have a puppy, What's she saying?    
 She barks,she whines,                 
 She scratches at the kitchen door.    
 She jumps up on you,                  
 She chews your fingers.               
 What's she saying?                    
 I sometimes wonder what it means.     
 I often wonder why she can't speak    
 human language.                       
 Perhaps she's wondering if other      
 puppies are around.                   
 What if she hears terrible noises and 
 sees lights flashing,                 
 Or people passing by the kitchen      
 window in the dark with a torch,      
 Or someone in our garden looking to   
 see if they can get in.               
 Our puppy might be trying to help us  
 or warn us about something so         
 What can she be saying?               
 I wonder.                             
                                       </content>
