		<content>We have to be at school for 9.00a.m.   
When the bell goes we line up in       
classes.The duty teacher comes and     
tells us to go in and put our coat and 
bag in the cloakroom.We go in the class
room where the teacher takes the regis-
ter.Usually we go in to assembly where 
the Headmaster or Deputy (Mr.Woods and 
Mr.Garland)talk to us.We sing a song   
and go back to the classroom for less- 
ons until 10.35a.m. We go out for play 
until 10.55a.m. then we continue less- 
ons until 12.00noon then it's dinner   
play. When the bell goes at 1.15p.m.   
we go in and read for twenty minutes   
and then we continue until 3.00p.m.    
when the teacher sometimes reads to us 
until twenty past three when it is     
home time.
