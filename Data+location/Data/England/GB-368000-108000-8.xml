		<content> My name is Naomi Chant.I am 9.I live  
 in a detached bungalow. My pets are a 
 rabbit,dog,tortoise,donkey,cat,fish   
 and birds.I have two brothers and two 
 sisters.My brothers' names are Jason  
 and Ben and my sisters' names are     
 Louisa and Emily.My garden is big and 
 wide.There is a  paddock for the      
 donkey.On July 6th I went to a ballet 
 show.I had to perform two dances.The  
 puppet dance was fun.I had to wear a  
 clown suit and a little hat.There were
 a lot of cameras flashing.            
 After the ballet show I went to watch 
 the magician.Jason went up to help the
 man to do his magic and the man gave  
 him a balloon.I went shopping with    
 Sharon and her Mum and Dad.The van    
 broke down so we had to use my Dad's  
 car.
