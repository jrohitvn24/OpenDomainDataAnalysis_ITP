		<content>    Halifax has a population of 90 000.
 It is situated on the edge of the     
 Pennines in the West Riding of        
 Yorkshire.Its traditional industry was
 wool-processing which gave it         
 prosperity,first in the late middle   
 ages,and again in the Victorian       
 age,when the town grew to its present 
 size and the characteristic stone     
 mills and terraces of houses were     
 built.                                
    The oldest part of the town nestles
 in the valley of the Hebble around the
 magnificent medieval parish church in 
 the Perpendicular style,but it later  
 expanded up the surrounding steep     
 hills.                                
    Halifax is within easy reach,by car
 or train,of larger cities such as     
 Leeds and Manchester,and from every   
 part of the town there are views of   
 open hills and pastures.              </content>
