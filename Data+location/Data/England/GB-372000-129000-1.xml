		<content> _Grassland husbandry plays an         
 important part in this rural area of  
 dairy and livestock farming. Averaging
 100 acres these family units support  
 about 1 cow per acre. The fields are  
 divided by ancient hedges, containing 
 large hedgerow trees, and ditches, the
 land lying wet in the witer. Wooded   
 areas, remains of the ancient         
 deciduous Forests of Selwood are      
 gradually being replaced by conifers. 
 The site of the Norman Ballands       
 castle is still apparent as a grassy  
 mound. The villages of Charlton       
 Musgrove and Penselwood are  scattered
 communities. The 12c  church at       
 Charlton Musgrove still stands,       
 togethr with a smaller 19c one. The   
 church at Pelselwood is 15c.          
 Individual new houses are being built.
 Apart fromt he farming communities,   
 residents are mainly retired people   </content>
