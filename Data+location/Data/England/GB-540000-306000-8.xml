		<content> RUMMERS FARM-J.A.CLARKE               
 The Clarke family moved to Inham Hall 
 in October 1917 and farmed Rummers    
 Farm. At this time there were 256     
 acres which has now, in 1985,         
 increased to approximately  600 acres.
 In the 1920's twelve men were employed
 mainly on fruit, potatoes, flowers and
 wheat. In 1985 the farm employs eight 
 men working on a variety of crops such
 as potatoes, sugarbeet, peas,rape     
 seed, onions, barley and wheat.The    
 wages of the twelve workers totalled  
 Â£20 per week in 1920, by 1985 one     
 worker earns four times that amount.  
 Machinery such as tractors were first 
 used on the farm in 1934, before that 
 most of the heavy work was done by    
 horses. The cost of produce has       
 increased greatly. In  1920 potatoes  
 were Â£5-Â£7 per ton and in 1985 Â£250   
 per ton.                              </content>
