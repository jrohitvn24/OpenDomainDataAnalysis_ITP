		<content> If you were flying over the area by   
 helicopter it would look like a giant 
 jigsaw puzzle, with all the fields    
 of crops and grassland fitting        
 together perfectly.Many small copses  
 and farms like pieces of a broken toy 
 are cast down by a giant unseen hand. 
 Roads going through look like veins   
 with paths like small arteries and    
 capillaries.The area is very rural    
 with mainly farms dotted about.The    
 population is very spread out         
 consisting of part of a village and a 
 couple of hamlets .The landscape is   
 very uneven.In summer the fields look 
 golden and green .Most of the activity
 is focused on farming with machinery  
 almost constantly humming.            
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
