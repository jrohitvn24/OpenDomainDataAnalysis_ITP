		<title>10BEVENDEAN FROM 1902</title>
		<content>   Originally Bevendean was an         
 agricultural area.There was no public 
 transport of any kind.There was a farm
 owned by the Allcorn family. They had 
 chickens and cows but no pigs.There   
 were a lot of cow pats where the shops
 are now!!!There were no cars so the   
 Allcorn's used a horse drawn wagon to 
 get to  market.Along Plymouth Avenue  
 grew barley &amp; oats.The first building 
 was built in 1920.                    
   The roads were very rocky and dusty.
 By 1930 all the houses in the Avenue  
 had been finished.The church and the  
 houses behind the school were not     
 built until after the World War Two.  
   The school was built in 1949. At    
 first the tram only ran to Coombe     
 Road.When buses were first introduced 
 to Bevendean the fare was only        
 2p.(RETURN!) from the centre of       
 Brighton.                             </content>
