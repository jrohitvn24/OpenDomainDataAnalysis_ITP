		<title>02A DAY FOR A WOMAN IN CURY</title>
		<content>     I get up at six thirty in the     
 morning. I have a wash, clean my      
 teeth and get dressed. Then I feed the
 chickens. After I get breakfast for   
 the family, which is myself,my husband
 and three children. I have five beds  
 to make. Once a week I clean the      
 windows. At about eleven forty five I 
 start preparing the midday lunch.     
 After lunch I wash the dishes.  The   
 children help in drying them and      
 putting them away. I might go shopping
 at the local shop once a week. We do  
 not have a radio, but we watch        
 television at lunchtimes and at five o
 clock for the news. At six thirty in  
 the evening we milk the cows. Later we
 read a book or the newspapers,while   
 the children play. The children do not
 do much on the farm yet. They go up to
 bed at six or seven o clock. My       
 husband and I go up at ten o clock.   </content>
