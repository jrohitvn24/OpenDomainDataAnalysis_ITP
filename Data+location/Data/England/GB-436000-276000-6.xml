		<content>   The Heron Way Industrial Estate is  
 mainly concerned with light industries
 such as engineering, chemicals, glass,
 and food packing. There is a large    
 sports equipment store, a             
 photographers,and a vehicle spare     
 parts shop. Most are trade only, but  
 some are open to the public.More units
 are to built in the near future.Most  
 employ between 10 and 30 people.      
   Very few employees, only 20 are     
 related to children at our school,    
 St.Bartholomews. We expected more, as 
 it seemed a potential source of local 
 employment. Noise levels are minimal  
 but the amount of traffic entering and
 leaving the estate has had some effect
 on all the residents.                 
   There is no pollution problem and   
 the estate is pleasantly laid out and 
 shielded from sight by a high grassy  
 bank.                                 </content>
