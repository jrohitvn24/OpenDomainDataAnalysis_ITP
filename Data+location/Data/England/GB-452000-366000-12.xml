{CRAIG HIND.                           
  When I got home on Friday I was so   
 pleased to hear that my dad had       
 fetched the keys to our new home.     
  The next day, I helped strip the     
 wallpaper off the walls and on Sunday 
 my dad put new wallpaper on. I helped 
 paint my bedroom in apple-white. It   
 looks very nice. My sisters have had  
 rose-white in their bedroom. They     
 have had a pink carpet, I have had a  
 beige one.                            
  We have a large garden. I mowed the  
 lawn, Dad dug the border and mum      
 planted bedding plants - all 148 of   
 them.
