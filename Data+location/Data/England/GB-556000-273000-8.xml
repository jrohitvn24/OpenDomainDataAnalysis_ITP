		<title>08Housing in Soham</title>
		<content>  Most houses in Soham were built      
 between 1965 and 1975,and fewest      
 houses were built between the first   
 and second world wars.The most common 
 type of house is a two-storey detached
 but there are many single-storey semi-
 detached homes. The majority of houses
 are built of brick with a tiled roof, 
 but there are a few flint houses and  
 some slate roofs.                     
   There are many new houses being     
 built, and most residents of Soham    
 are in favour of the new developments 
 because they hope that this will      
 improve local amenities. However some 
 people do not welcome new housing     
 development as they are afraid that it
 might spoil the friendly atmosphere in
 the town. There are several long-     
 established families in the town who  
 have lived here for more than 30      
 years.                                </content>
