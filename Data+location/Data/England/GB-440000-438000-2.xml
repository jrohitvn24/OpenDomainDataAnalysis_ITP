		<content> The area is a mixture of fields and   
 woodland. The fields are mainly used  
 for crops. The most common crop is    
 wheat, but there are also fields of   
 sugar beet, oil seed rape, and barley.
 There are a few fields with cattle and
 sheep. There is one farm, consisting  
 of a farm house and several barns     
 (owner not known .) The woodland is a 
 mixture of coniferous and chestnuts.  
 The public footpaths which run across 
 this area are largely overgrown with  
 tall grass.
