		<title>17DISUSED CHALK PITS</title>
		<content>    On the chalk downs of Arreton and  
 Mersley along their southern scarp    
 faces are twelve disused chalk pits,  
 the largest being the Downend Chalk   
 Pit. Chalk was formerly quarried in   
 these pits and used locally as a      
 dressing on both the heavy clay soils 
 and on the lighter soils. The chalk   
 was also used for lime-wash and       
 plaster and one lane in the south west
 of the block derives its name from the
 lime kiln used for this: namely Lime  
 Kiln Shute.                           
    The pits today are scars on the    
 landscape, some being used as         
 "dumping" grounds, others are         
 overgrown and dangerous.              
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
