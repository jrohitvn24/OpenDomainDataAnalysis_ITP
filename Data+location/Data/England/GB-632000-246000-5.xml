		<content> Woodbridge USAF Base has two schools, 
 an Elementary with 1000 pupils age    
 range 5-12 years, and a High School of
 about 600 pupils aged 12-16. The all- 
 American staff in both schools number 
 over 100. There is one English co-    
 ordinator for joint Anglo-American    
 activities. The schools cater for the 
 Woodbridge and Bentwaters Bases, and  
 children from up to 30 miles travel   
 daily in about 50 buses.  The only    
 libraries in the area are in these    
 schools, the one in the High School   
 having over 7000 volumes, also film   
 strips and records. In addition there 
 are educational cassettes, 3 video    
 recorders and 2 computers for student 
 use. The Art Dept curriculum includes 
 cinematics and a speech and drama     
 group. Local British children are     
 bussed to schools at Hollesley, Butley
 and Woodbridge.                       </content>
