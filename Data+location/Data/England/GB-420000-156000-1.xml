		<content> Downs to North West of Collingbourne  
 Kingston. The block covers an area of 
 undullating down land which is now    
 farmed extensively.  It is an area of 
 outstanding naural beauty and wilk    
 life abounds among the verges to the  
 fields and in the small areas of      
 woodland.                             
 The small hmlet of Creighton is       
 situated in the S.E. corner of the    
 block.  It comprises a few old        
 thatched cottages and much large group
 of council houses.  There is little   
 work in the locality apart from that  
 on the farms and even there jobs ae   
 few due to extensive use of modern    
 machinery.
