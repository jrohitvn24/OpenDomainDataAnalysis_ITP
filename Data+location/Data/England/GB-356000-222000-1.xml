		<title>01PART OF ROSS AND AREA TO SW</title>
		<content> Ross-on-Wye is a steep streeted town  
 of Georgian Houses, standing on a bend
 in the river and looking towards the  
 Welsh hills. It is the main tourist   
 centre for the Wye Valley. In the town
 centre is a 17th century arcaded      
 market hall. Ross traditionally has   
 been a small market town, but in the  
 last decade, or more, there have been 
 considerable housing developments     
 changing it into a dormitory town as  
 the M50 conveniently links it to the  
 motorway network. Traditional farming 
 methods have been superseded by       
 corporate ownership, in many cases,   
 placing the emphasis on cereals, sugar
 beet and potatoes.
