		<content>The Church is justly a place to visit, 
pricipally for the Howard tombs in     
the chancel. An earlier church         
building was possibly closer to the    
Castle,with which its early history    
was closely linked. The present nave   
was built in the 13th C, and the       
Â£Decorated Style' aisles about 1450 by 
the 4th Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk. Henry
VIII dissolved Thetford Priory and the 
3rd Howard Duke of Norfolk moved the   
family tombs to a much widened chancel.
Another feature is the Tamar organ,    
once in Pembroke College. One of only  
eight Tamar cases which survived the   
destruction of Cromwell's Commissioners
it is now at the west-end of the       
church. Visitors are also impressed by 
Â£The Glory', a mystical 17th C painting
which reminds todays Christians, not   
only of their historical heritage, but 
also of the wonder and power of faith. </content>
