 our rectangle we found a dismantled   
 railway in a cutting.It was overgrown 
 with trees and bushes.It looked as if 
 it was being used as a public         
 footpath.{Pond.} Along the Ashdon Road
 we found a pond covered in weed.{

 believed to have been built in the

 derelict and the doors and windows    
 have been boarded up.The house is to  
 be renovated.Giant hogweed was growing
 in the yard.{Farmland. }Tic beans and
