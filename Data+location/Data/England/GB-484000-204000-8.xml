		<content>{COOMBE HILL NEAR DUNSMORE             
 Coombe Hill which belongs to the      
 National Trust is the highest point in
 the Bucks. Chilterns, with splendid   
 views towards Aylesbury Vale, Chequers
 Court and Oxon. The hill is mainly    
 uncultivated scrubland and deciduous  
 woodland. It is the home of many wild 
 creatures including Badgers,          
 Squirrels, Muntjac Deer and Glis_Glis.
 The N.T. may with the approval of the 
 Charity Commission, lease its land.   
 Thus Coombe Hill is let to the local  
 farmers for sheep grazing. The        
 residents of Ellesborough have grazing
 and wood_gathering rights on the hill.
 The monument on the summit is not N.T.
 property. It is a memorial to the 148 
 local soldiers who fell in the Boer   
 War. It is a eminent landmark which   
 has been struck by lightning at least 
 twice. It has been restored in 1985.  </content>
