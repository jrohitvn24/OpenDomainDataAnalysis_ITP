		<content> The Village Hall in Fairlight, East   
 Sussex is the meeting place for the   
 following Clubs which meet once a     
 month:  Floral, Gardening, Women's    
 Institute, Winemakers. The first three
 of these meet during the early        
 afternoon and so are not available to 
 the majority of employed villagers.   
 The Winemakers Club meets at 7.30pm.  
                                       
 Monthly meetings are held at the      
 Village Hall by:  an active Residents 
 Association at 7.30pm, the Parish     
 Council at 7pm, the Village Hall      
 Management Committee at 7.30pm, so all
 of these activities are available to  
 most of the villagers.                
                                       
 Four doctors hold surgeries at noon at
 the Village Hall on Mondays and       
 Fridays each week.
