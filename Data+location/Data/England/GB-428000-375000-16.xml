		<title>16HOLMESFIELD CRICKET CLUB</title>
		<content> The present Holmesfield cricket club  
 was started in 1930. Their first      
 ground was near to the Robin Hood     
 public house in Holmesfield. After    
 1960 they moved to Millthorpe. They   
 have won the league title three       
 times. The highest score they have    
 ever reached is 270 for 3. Once a man 
 collected 10 wickets  in one game. The
 first captain of the present          
 Holmesfield cricket team was C.Rose.  
 They used to have an under 16's team  
 but there is now nobody to take the   
 team. The first team plays in{North   
{Derbyshire League}. The second team   
 only plays friendly matches. Most of  
 the cricketers live in Holmesfield,   
 but there is one from Chesterfield,   
 and two from Dronfield. So far this   
 season they have played 20 league     
 matches. The first team is top of the 
 third division of the league.         </content>
