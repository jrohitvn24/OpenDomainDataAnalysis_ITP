		<content>    Boothby referred to as "Bodebi" in 
 the first domesday book,originally got
 its name from the viking invaders who 
 renamed the village with a -by ending 
 to show it was a settlement.The name  
 Pagnell was added later probaly       
 originating from the Pagnell family   
 who lived at the manor in Boothby.we  
 spoke to the oldest man in Boothby, he
 told us Boothby was a farming village 
 but now most people work in Grantham. 
    The main water supply in Boothby   
 used to be an underground stream.     
 pumped by a man at the old clubhouse. 
    A famous landmark in Boothby is a  
 Norman Manor house,one of the         
 oldest,best preserved manors in       
 Britain,also in the village there is a
 12th century church called ST Andrews 
 it is in good codition and in 1896    
 some extentions were built on the side
 for a vestry.                         </content>
