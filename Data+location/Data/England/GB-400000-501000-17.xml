		<title>17THE METHODIST CHAPEL</title>
		<content> The present{chapel}was built,         
 adjoining the Wesleyan Chapel,in      
 1882.The land was bought for Â£30 in   
 1875 and the building officially      
 opened in October 1883. It is         
 described as being 'Romanesque style'.
 At that time the{population}was great 
 and many people in the dale were      
 methodists. On the afternoon of the   
 opening only 21 of the 217 children on
 roll attended school.                 
 The Chapel stands in a prominent      
 position by the side of the road and  
 has its own graveyard.                
 In 1985 a new minister was appointed  
 to the circuit. His first service in  
 Arkengarthdale took place in September
 1985 with a{congregation}of 2 people  
 and an organist.                      
 At the moment renovations and the     
 installation of new central heating   
 are taking place.                     </content>
