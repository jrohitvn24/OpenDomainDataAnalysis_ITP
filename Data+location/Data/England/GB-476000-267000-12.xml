		<title>12Going riding</title>
		<content>     Sometimes I go to the stables at  
 Moulton riding school.It is owned by  
 Mr.Woolman, but the teaching is done  
 by Laurie.She has passed lots of exams
 so that she can teach us to ride      
 properly and safely. She is helped by 
 a girl called Val.                    
     The horses are all very gentle and
 well-schooled.The little ponies are   
 called Peanuts and Tonic.Other ponies 
 are called Dandy, Micky and Flicker.  
 There are some horses called Honey,   
 Polly, Major, Bracken, Toby and Tammy.
                                       
     The riding lessons last for one   
 hour and cost{Â£5.}I like it best when 
 we go out on a hack. We go down Pond  
 Lane, along the Pitsford road and out 
 into the country near{Holcot}where we 
 can canter.We cross a river and my    
 pony Micky loves to go in the middle  
 for a splash.                         </content>
