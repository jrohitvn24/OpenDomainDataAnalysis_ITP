		<title>17The Fun Run</title>
		<content> In April 1984 we held a sponsored fun 
 run along the newly built Great Chart 
 by-pass.We did it for two reasons,to  
 raise money to go towards books and   
 sports equipment and to celebrate the 
 opening of the by-pass.The main road  
 outside was so busy that we definitely
 benefitted from it.The day dawned     
 dreary and black clouds covered the   
 sky.As we arrived there in people's   
 cars the skies opened and it began    
 bucketing down.We grouped into threes 
 with an adult.Various groups started  
 off in the pouring rain.There were 5  
 refreshment stations with drinks of   
 orange.Everyone completed the three   
 miles.When we all returned to school  
 Doris,our cook,gave us a drink of     
 cocoa and we sat clutching our sponsor
 form with a school stamp on it.
