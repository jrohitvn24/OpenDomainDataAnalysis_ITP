		<content> The Manor House at Upper Upham        
 reputedly has two ghosts.  The first  
 is that of a lady of Upham House who  
 was murdered and her spirit walks in  
 the twilight around the Tudor Mansion 
 and in the Italian grounds.  A former 
 member of the staff was said to be    
 tucked up in bed by her.  Her hearse  
 (horse drawn) goes slowly down from   
 the heights to Aldbourne (a nearby    
 village).                             
                                       
 The second ghost is that of a mother  
 whose daughter was killed in a riding 
 accident.  She walks the grounds      
 calling her daughter's name.  At the  
 time a schoolroom next to the Chapel  
 remained just as the young lady left  
 it.                                   
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
