		<title>05Bouley Bay Hill Climb</title>
		<content> This is one of the events organised by
 the Jersey Motor Cycle and Light Car  
 Club. The road from Bouley Bay up is a
 very steep and winding hill ideal for 
 the race called a "hill climb" which  
 is very popular throughout Britain.   
 There are separate classes for motor  
 bikes and cars. The race is a time    
 trial against the clock from the      
 bottom to the top of the 1O11 yard    
 long course. There are three meetings 
 a year. There is one on Easter Monday 
 and on the Spring Bank Holiday. These 
 are called closed events because they 
 are only for local competitors. The   
 main event is during the third weekend
 in July . It is one of the{British    
{National Hill Climb championships}and 
 so is an open event . In June l985 the
 fastest car record was 39 seconds,held
 by {Martin Bolsover. This gives an    
{average speed of 51.5 m.p.h.}         </content>
