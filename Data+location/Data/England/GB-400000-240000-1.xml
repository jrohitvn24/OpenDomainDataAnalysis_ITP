		<content> This area is undergoing a change in   
 character,where the rural scene       
 struggles for existence,the urban     
 is expanding.The main road linking the
 Midlands with the M5 South passes     
 through the region and much heavy     
 traffic is in evidence.               
 The southern part of Evesham is       
 beginning to and will eventually lose 
 a large acreage of farm land for both 
 housing and industrial growth inside  
 the area of the new By-pass.          
 The village of Hinton-on-the Green is 
 suffering the plight of many small    
 villages.Its local                    
 Post Office/store,school &amp; pub. have  
 gone and its once self-supporting     
 community is on the decline.A light   
 industrial estate has developed.The   
 surrounding land is fairly typical of 
 rural Worcestershire,producing grain  
 and market garden produce.            </content>
