   Gretton Parish Church is dedicated  
to St. James.  It was built in the     
eleventh century, probably from local  
ironstone and some stone from further  
afield.  In the twelfth century, side  
aisles were added.  Three hundred years
later the tower was built which houses 
the five bells.  In the eighteenth     
century, the floor of the chancel was  
raised in order that the Hatton family 
(the Lord's of the Manor of Gretton)   
could have a family vault underneath.  
                                       
   Since the first church records were 
kept, there have been fifty-five       
vicars, the longest reigning incumbent 
being a Robert Graham who was vicar for
forty-one years during the reign of    
King George III.
