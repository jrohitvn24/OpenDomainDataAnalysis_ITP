		<title>09After school</title>
		<content> An area of Blackburn where people     
 congregate is Pleckgate School. After 
 school, around six o'clock the tennis 
 courts are full of budding tennis     
 players - there will be at least two  
 couples waiting to play. who will be  
 knocking the ball against a wall      
 somewhere playing an equivalent of    
 squash with tennis rackets. By eight  
 o' clock there will be at least five  
 couples waiting although some of them 
 will go home without ever getting a   
 game. About ten until half past there 
 will be a few straining their eyesight
 watching the ball as well as many     
 arguments about whether the ball was  
 in or out. After eleven o' clock the  
 courts and school will be clear apart 
 from the elite few who never came to  
 play tennis, unless they had a game in
 a doorway or something.
