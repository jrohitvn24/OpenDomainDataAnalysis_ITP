     In 1841 in Bishops Nympton there  
 were lots of shops but slowy through  
 the years shops are getting fewer and 
 some of the shops were ---------------
{Tailor     -Edward Bawden,            
{Butcher    -Thomas Bond,              
{Baker      -Hugh Chanter,             
{Clockmender-William Gould,            
{Grocer     -Abraham Cole,             
{Butcher    -John Mildon,              
     Then there were even fewer shops. 
 In 1958 the shops were like this----- 
{1 Butcher,}                           
{1 Grocer,                             
{1 Confectioner,                       
{2 Bakers,                             
 and now there is only one shop in     
 Bishops Nympton and the Post Office is
 joined on to it.                      </content>
