		<content>We went to the Music School.   At the  
chemistry block there are 16 rooms.  In
the cloisters there is a  big room     
called the Common Room  for the        
Masters.   In the computer department  
there was a boy who was making a       
computer.   The Cripps library was     
built by the Cripps family in 1903.    
At School House we went into the dining
room to see what it was like, it had   
lots of silver cups which the boys had 
won.   The Great Hall is used for many 
concerts, debates and the film society.
The Great Hall is very impressive and  
was built in 19O7 and was designed by  
Arthur Blomfield.   This is how much   
the parents pay for the boys each year:
four million and fifty seven thousand  
and one hundred and twenty five pounds.
