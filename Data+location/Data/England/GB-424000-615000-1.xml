    The majority of this area can be   
 described as coastal farmland.It      
 includes two main villages,the smaller
 of the two being Howick.              
    Howick is a small village of only a
 few houses owned by Howick Charitable 
 Trust.Howick Hall and gardens are our 
 main tourist attraction;the hall      
 dating from 1782 when it was built by 
 Sir Henry Grey.                       
    Longhoughton,the larger village,is 
 used by the R.A.F.as quarters for     
 servicemen stationed at the nearby    
 radar base at Boulmer.The school is at
 Longhoughton,as well as a community   
 centre which is used by many clubs,   
 societies,clinics etc.                
    The beaches along the coast are    
 beautiful,although unsafe for bathing:
 all in all a perfect mixture of       
 countryside and sea.                  </content>
