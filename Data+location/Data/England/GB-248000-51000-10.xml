		<title>10JENNYCLIFF BEACH</title>
		<content> When we first walked on to Jennycliff 
{Beach},we thought it looked very dirty
 and there was a bad smell. There was  
 lots of seaweed scattered around the  
{pebbly and rocky shore.}It wasn't a   
 nice place for swimming as the water  
 was dirty and there was litter on     
 the beach but the{views}of Plymouth   
 Sound, Drakes Island, the Hoe         
 and the Breakwater, were pleasant. We 
 found that most of the people there   
 were locals enjoying the view during  
 their lunch times. There is a small   
 hut next to the car park which serves 
 food and drinks during the season,    
 April to September, and a larger cafe.
 A few years ago this area was greatly 
 improved by the removal of a caravan  
 site and it is now very popular with  
{elderly people}who can enjoy the views
 from the car park without taking the  
 steep steps to the beach.             </content>
