		<title>13Shops in King's  Sutton</title>
		<content>                                       
    For a village of its size King's   
 Sutton still has a surprising number  
 of shops.   There are four general    
 food stores, as well as a butcher.    
 One of these stores is an off-licence 
 and another sells newspapers and      
 magazines.   There is also a Post     
 Office with D-I-Y goods,a             
 hair-dresser's and a shop which sells 
 things like wool.   Most people in    
 King's Sutton try to support the local
 shops and only those who prefer a good
 supermarket go to Banbury to buy food.
    If you cannot or do not want to    
 walk to the shops there are mobile    
 vans, which come round weekly, to help
 you.   A fish and chips van which     
 comes on Friday is popular and there  
 is also a fresh fish van once a week.
