		<content>  In the morning some people were      
 quite lazy and they would just sit    
 there and read the news paper.Most    
 people had to work but a few read     
 books,  watched videos, gardened and  
 minded children.                      
                                       
  Most people ate lunch between        
 12.00 to 12.30.                       
                                       
  The most common food was sandwiches  
 and rolls, then chips with something, 
 just chips and beans on toast.        
                                       
  Fewer people were at work, or at     
 school in the afernoon than they      
 were in the morning.Perhaps they      
 worked part time and children went to 
 nursery school. Most people did their 
 housework in the morning.             
                                       
                                       </content>
