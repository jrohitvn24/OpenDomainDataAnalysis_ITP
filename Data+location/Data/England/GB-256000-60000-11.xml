		<title>11LEE MOOR AREA-WILDLIFE.</title>
		<content> Being on the edge of Dartmoor all     
 kinds of wildlife can be seen,such as 
 rabbits,foxes,badgers and small       
 rodents.Interestingly,the area where  
 china clay has been extracted around  
 Lee Moor also provides habitats for   
 animals.It is said that foxes which   
 are being chased in foxhunts head for 
 the china clay workings because the   
 dogs and horses are unable to follow  
 them.Eventually,when the extraction of
 china clay has finished(which could   
 take over one hundred years) it is    
 hoped to turn the area into a country 
 park.Also,Canada geese are nesting on 
 the mica dams.One good thing about the
 waste tips of sand is that they are   
 not toxic and vegetation is being     
 encouraged to grow on the tip.The     
 wooded areas in the grid provide a    
 habitat for many kinds of woodland    
 birds.                                </content>
