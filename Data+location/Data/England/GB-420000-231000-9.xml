		<title>09OPINIONS ON MORETON MARKET</title>
		<content> Four local shopkeepers all agree that 
 the{Market} is good for Moreton. They 
 thought that about 80 per cent of     
 shopkeepers would also agree.         
  Two said that it could be improved by
 better{traffic control.}The other two 
 said it could be improved by being    
 smaller because there are too many of 
 the same stalls and they go too near  
 to the main road.They all said they   
 get{more customers}on a Tuesday, and  
 on a Wednesday morning outside their  
 shop it is{cleaner}than any other day 
 of the week.                          
  Some form of{seating}would be an     
 advantage to those spending the       
 whole day in the town. The{cheap}     
{transport}provided encourages many    
 people to come to Moreton on a        
 Tuesday.This keeps the town{busy}which
 is very important for shopkeepers.
