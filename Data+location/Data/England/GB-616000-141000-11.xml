		<title>11MR VERNEY</title>
		<content>    Mr. Verney has been a tailor in{   
{Elham}for 74 years, since 1911.He was 
 apprenticed for 5 years and paid one  
 shilling per week. He made hunting    
 coats, riding breeches, livery for    
 coachmen, footmen and gamekeepers;    
{Acrise}and{Sandling}Place being his   
 clients. He even had clients from     
{America, France and Sweden.           
{ }The scissors that he cut the        
 material with, were over 100 year     
 old. The materials that he used were  
 strong broad cloth, cavalry twill and 
 cordouroy. They were mostly hand      
 stitched. Two people who lived in{    
{London}made the family crest buttons  
 for the uniforms. When these two      
 people died other people tried to make
 the buttons but the tops kept falling 
 off.
