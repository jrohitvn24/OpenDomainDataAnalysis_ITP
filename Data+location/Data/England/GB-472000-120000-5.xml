		<content> Total area 332 acres.{                
{Crops:}Their crop rotation involves   
 oats, wheat, barley, turnips, sheep   
 and pasture.  The turnips are sown    
 after the barley to crop in the same  
 year.  The sheep will then graze on   
 the turnips and fertilize the ground  
 in preparation for pastures.  The     
 wheat and barley are sold, some of    
 the barley is sent for malting and the
 oats are sold to eventually become    
 breakfast cereal.{ Livestock:}About   
 360 mules (a cross between Border     
 Leicester/Swaledale) are reared. 25-40
 heifers are reared in summer only.  { 
{Mechanisation:}3 members of the       
 farmer's family run the farm.  3      
 tractors and 1 combine harvester are  
 based at the farm.  Additional sewage 
 from the Petersfield Sewage Farm is   
 used.  The  E.E.C. has helped finance 
 a land drainage scheme.               </content>
