 This is a game where somebody is "he" 
 and you have to sneak up on them. If  
 the person who is "he"turns round and 
 sees you, then you have to go back to 
 the start. When you get up to the     
 finish, the person who is "he" tells a
 story and when they get to the words  
 "Black Cat" all the pkayers have to   
 run back to the start before they are 
 caught.                               
{RED LETTER                            
 One person is "he"and first of all    
 they choose one letter to be the red  
 letter. During the game the person who
 is "he" calls out lots of letters in  
 turn and if that letteris in your name
 you move forward one step. If the "red
 letter" is called and someone moves   
 they have to go back to the start. The
 winner is the first person to reach   
 the front.                            </content>
