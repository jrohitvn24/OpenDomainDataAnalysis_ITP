		<content>There is an Anglican church at South   
Moreton-the church of St John.         
Near the church is a mound which is    
said to cover those men of South       
Moreton who fell in battle in the Civil
War. Most of these would probably have 
been archers since archery was a       
compulsory Â£hobby' in 1628 judging from
the records of that year which show    
that those who failed to practise their
skill at archery were fined.
