		<title>18 A POLICEMANS DAY IN W/BAY</title>
		<content>Whitley Bay police station has just be-
-en renovated at the cost of 80,000    
pounds so as to remain able to operate 
officers 3/4 of whom are constables wi-
-th the remainder special officers.An  
average PC on duty could expect to be  
injured at least once as there job in- 
-volves an increasing amount of foot   
patrolling replacing the usual car pa- 
-trolling of which W/B operates 3 cars 
at all times.The running and maintena- 
-nce of these is costly and this toge- 
-ther with cuts in spare resources and 
increases in manpower make patrolling  
on foot an economic and PR necessity.  
To become a policeman each man/woman   
trains for 13 weeks and works for a 2  
year probationary period after which 2 
weeks training is required every 4 yea-
-rs.Once on the beat each man carries a
Radio,truncheon,handcuffs and notebook 
and if needed back up is minutes away. </content>
