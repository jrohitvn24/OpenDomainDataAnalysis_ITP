		<title>17A CHILD OF THE ARMY</title>
		<content> ARMY LIFE ISN'T AS BAD AS WHAT IT IS  
 MADE OUT TO BE. A LOT OF CHILDREN     
 WOUDN'T HAVE BEEN TO SO MANY DIFFERENT
 PLACES IF THEIR PARENTS WERE NOT      
 CONNECTED WITH THE ARMY. YOUR FATHER  
 OR MOTHER WOULD HAVE TO BE VERY LUCKY 
 TO GET A POSTING OVERSEAS. A LOT OF   
 PEOPLE THINK THAT BEING IN THE ARMY   
 WOULD RUIN YOUR SCHOOL LIFE, BUT MOST 
 ARMY BASES HAVE SCHOOLS ON THEM. BEING
 IN THE FORCES YOU MEET A LOT OF NEW   
 AND OLD FRIENDS. THE WORST THING ABOUT
 IT, IS THAT YOU HAVE TO LEAVE YOUR    
 FRIENDS BEHIND WHEN YOU GO AWAY.
