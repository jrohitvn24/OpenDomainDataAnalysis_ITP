		<content> JW Cooks Shipyard can make sea-going  
 vessels and is SE of Wivenhoe.Its     
 employees volunteer to man the local  
 Fire Station. Near the yard are small 
 unmetalled roads with dense housing in
 this Tree Conservation Area. Many     
 houses were built for fishermen and   
 sailors and have sail lofts.          
  Small light industries like Dry      
 Cleaners and boat builders occupy a   
 previous Gas Works site. Also 50 units
 are for rent in one small industrial  
 works closed in 1982.                 
 North of the Colchester-Clacton       
 Railway Line are Victorian Terraces   
 and 2 1960-80's Housing Estates,      
 partly built in the depression of     
 previous sand excavations.            
 The flood plain is crossed by a dis-  
 used railway which used to link       
 Colchester to Brightlingsea and pro-  
 tected from high tides by a levee.    </content>
