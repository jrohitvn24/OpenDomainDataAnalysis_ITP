		<content> Upminster is a middle-class area,and  
 most people move here because on the  
 train it only takes 20-25 minutes to  
 London.                               
 Most houses in Upminster are privately
 owned,and the most popular type of    
 house is a 3{BEDROOMED SEMI-DETACHED  
 house.There are a few{COUNCIL ESTATES 
 and half a dozen blocks of flats near 
 the town centre.                      
 Early growth was due to the coming of 
 the railway in late Victorian/early   
 Edwardian times.Away from the C.B.D.  
 most of Upminster's houses were built 
 between 1913-1940 and in Cranham      
 between1950-1960.Recent growth is     
 limited by the{GREENBELT ACT.

 Upminster and the{AVERAGE PRICE}is
