		<content>In our survey we discovered that the   
majority of houses in the area used gas
as the major form of heating however in
the more remote parts electricity is   
the only form of energy available.     
   Every family in our survey had a    
washing machine and 90% had either a   
fridge or fridge/freezer. Several      
families had additional facilities such
as tumble driers or microwave ovens.   
   In 67% of all households there were 
4 people living in the house. 27% of   
all households had 3 people living     
in the house. 4% had 5 and 2% had 6.   
There were no houses containing 1 or 2 
people however we suspect there are.   
    Pets proved to be popular with 80% 
of our families. Budgies, cats and dogs
being the three most popular choices.  
    With our families a roast Sunday   
dinner was easily the favourite dish.
