		<content> The{three villages of Cropwell Butler,
{Tithby and Wiverton}in the Trent      
 Valley were recorded in the Domesday  
 Book, 1086. Their individual          
 development is here described. The    
 dominance of Cropwell Butler is       
 revealed by the accounts of its{      
{Village Hall}and many groups which    
 assemble there. The large commuter    
 population of Cropwell Butler is      
 revealed by the page on{housing,}as is
 the importance of the Methodist Church
 at Cropwell Butler, illuminated by the
 page on{Worship.}Future developments  
 in the area are forshadowed in the    
 account of{conservation,}and the      
 discovery of oil at Cropwell Butler.
