		<title>13Carn Barra, St. Levan.</title>
		<content> Carn Barra lies a mile north-westof   
 Gwennap Head and is a superb cliffland
 of great complexity and beauty. The   
 name{Carn Barra means the 'Loaf Carn'.
 From the headland itself the cliffs   
 run south-eastwards in a line of great
 lichen covered towers. Between the    
 towers steep grassy slopes run down to
 where the lower cliffs drop vertically
 to the sea. In spring the upper slopes
 are a mass of flowers, small hassocks 
 of stonecrop interspersed with thrift,
 sea-campion and purple heather. In    
 stark contrast the lower cliffs are a 
 clean sequence of clean granite walls 
 rising from sea-washed platforms; a   
 remarkable piece of rock architecture 
 about two hundred feet across. In calm
 weather it looks like some abandoned  
 harbour wall it is so precisely       
 shaped. But no ship could berth here, 
 the run of the sea is  so powerful.   </content>
