		<content> Due to its altitude the climate here  
 is slightly cooler than Leicestershire
 generally,fresh breeze in summer and  
 heavier snow falls in winter.Homes in 
 Whitcrofts Lane are occasionally cut  
 off.Beacon Hill is particularly       
 exposed to east winds and visitors    
 comment there is no higher land as far
 as Siberia.The area is very accessible
 on foot.In addition to some 150 acres 
 of public open space there are over 5 
 miles of public footpaths across      
 fields and covering almost the whole  
 area.Stiles are either wooden with a  
 diagonal step or a narrow gap in stone
 walls.In a very beautiful area it is  
 much regretted that litter especially 
 of household and garden rubbish is    
 often dumped in hedgerows along the   
 roads from passing cars.Also stones   
 from the walls and leafmould from the 
 woods find their way into city gardens</content>
