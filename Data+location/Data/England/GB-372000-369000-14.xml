		<title>14A Visit To The Lake District</title>
		<content> Lake District.                        
 The 4th years from Byley school went  
 on an extended visit to Grange over   
 Sands in the Lake District for 5 days 
 in May.  The house that we stayed in  
 was called Kent's Bank House.  We     
 visited many places around Grange,    
 including Silverdale, Cartmel Priory, 
 Hawkshead and Brockhole.  One evening 
 Cedric Robinson visited us.  He is the
 Queen's Guide to the Sands.  He guides
 people over the dangerous quicksands  
 of Morecambe Bay, and has written two 
 books about his experiences.  The     
 house that we stayed in was very big  
 and the food was very good.  All the  
 boys from Byley slept in one room.  We
 went to bed at 9.00 PM.               
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
