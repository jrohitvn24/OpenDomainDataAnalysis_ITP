		<content>In Gislingham most houses are made of  
bricks, but some old houses are of clay
lump or lath and plaster. All houses   
have a garden or some land. Every house
in the area has electricity connection,
and while most village houses are      
connected to the main sewer, outside   
the village every house needs a septic 
tank. For those who prefer gas for     
cooking and/or heating containers are  
delivered as no mains supply exists.   
Almost every house in the area is      
connected to the telephone system.
