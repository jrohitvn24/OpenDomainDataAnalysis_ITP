		<title>18Southend:Local interest</title>
		<content>    In Southend there are several      
 features which are generally          
 interesting for the public.One of     
 these is{Southchurch Hall}which was   
 built in the early 14th century and   
 extended in the mid-sixteenth century.
    It is now a popular{museum}set in  
 attractive gardens with many birds and
 ducks in the pond there.              
    Another of these features is       
{Mulberry Harbour}in the Thames        
 Estuary.This is part of the large     
 harbour constructed by the allies in  
 the Second World War for the invasion 
 of Europe in 1944.It was constructed  
 along the estuary and towed to        
 Arromanches in France.One part of it  
 sunk and now is a common sight from   
 the seafront area from where it can be
 seen at high or low tide.
