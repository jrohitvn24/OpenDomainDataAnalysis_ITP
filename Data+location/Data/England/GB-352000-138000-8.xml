		<title>08CHEESE MAKING TODAY</title>
		<content>    In West Pennard there is a cheese  
 making farm which has been run by the 
 same family for over 65 years.Its milk
 comes from about 900 cows on this and 
 two other farms in the area. Over 2000
 gallons of milk are used each day and 
 each gallon makes 1lb of cheese. After
 quick heating and cooling to kill     
 germs, rennet is added to separate the
 milk into liquid whey(which is drained
 off to make cream,butter and pig food)
 and the solid, rubbery, tasteles curds
 which are chopped, salted and put into
 moulds. After pressing, the moulds are
 removed and the cheese is wrapped in  
 waxed cloths and stored in controlled 
 conditions to mature. The resulting   
 Cheddar cheeses are sold at about one 
 year old. Some are sold from the farm,
 others go to local shops or           
 distributers.Some are sold in a famous
 London department store at Christmas. </content>
