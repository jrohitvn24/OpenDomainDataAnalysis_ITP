		<content>{Lady Patrica is the only titled       
{person in our D-block.Her husband and 
{herself have lived at Moorhouse Farm  
{since 1951.Her husband died three     
{years ago in 1982.                    
{  The house, when they arrived, was a 
{tip.There was no indoor lighting or   
{indoor lavatories and the house had   
{not been decorated for about 20       
{years!Lady Patricia does not live at  
{Helperby Hall because she likes the   
{people and the land in her present    
{surroundings.                         
{  When the renovation was started the 
{Milnes-Coates family moved out. Not   
{only were the buildings dilapidated   
{but the arable land was of very poor  
{quality too.Lady Patricia's husband   
{had studied agricultural sciences at  
{Cambridge and was very keen to put his
{learning into practice. They attempted
{to farm their land by organic methods.</content>
