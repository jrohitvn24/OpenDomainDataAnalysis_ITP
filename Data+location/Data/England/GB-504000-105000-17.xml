		<title>17COPPICING, ANGMERING PARK</title>
		<content> In ancient England, when wood was used
 for many things, people invented a    
 system of forestry called coppicing to
 keep up the supply. In Angmering      
 Woods, now leased to the Forestry     
 Commision, the original copses are    
 still clearly laid out. Oak and hazel 
 were grown.  The tops of the oak were 
 cut till there was only a trunk.  This
 was called pollarding. The oak then   
 sprouted thick branches from the top  
 used for fuel, house beams and ships. 
 The hazels were cut down to the ground
 so they grew thin sprouts for uses    
 like Sussex hurdle fences. This is    
 coppicing. Most of the woodland was   
 planted about 100 to 300 years ago    
 although Buckman's Coppice and Poling 
 Coppice are mentioned in a document of
 1679. The older copses have wavy      
 boundaries whilst those planted after 
 1700 have straight ones.              </content>
