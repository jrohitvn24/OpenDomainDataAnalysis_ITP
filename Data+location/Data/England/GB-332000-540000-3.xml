		<title>03General farming in Sebergham</title>
		<content>    Owner occupation of farms is be-   
 coming more usual these days though in
 this area there are two farms forming 
 part of the once vast Lowther Estates 
 owned by the Earls of Lonsdale.  The  
 area had previously been owned by the 
 Dukes of Devonshire.                  
    The area and climate is suited to  
 milk production though some of the    
 farms now run a few suckler cows and  
 sheep are becoming more common.       
    The only crops grown are winter    
 fodder principally barley for cattle  
 and root crops for sheep.  Potatoes   
 are only grown for home consumption   
 and farm gate sales.                  
    Some of the farms on the North     
 facing slopes of Warnell Fell are     
 treated as summer farms and some of   
 these are farmed in conjunction with  
 farms on the flatter ground.  They are
 used for summering young stock.       </content>
