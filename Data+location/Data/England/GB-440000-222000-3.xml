		<title>03Crops on Barton Abbey Estate</title>
		<content> In 1985, the following crops were     
 grown:                                
 Cereals - winter wheat, winter barley 
 and spring barley (these are cash     
 crops subsidised by the EEC, so their 
 acreage is increasing);               
 Rape - this is grown for seed, its oil
 content is needed for processing (a   
 relatively new crop in the last       
 fifteen years);                       
 Beans - grown for animal feed,        
 particularly high in protein;         
 Grass - grown for forage for cattle;  
 and permanent pasture, including the  
 parkland used for grazing sheep.      
                                       
                                       
 Most farms in this area are, like     
 this, a mixture of different types of 
 arable crop and different types of    
 stock.
