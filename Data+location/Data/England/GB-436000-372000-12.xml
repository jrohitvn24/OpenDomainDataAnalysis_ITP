		<content>   My name is Andrew McCulloch. I was  
 born in 1975 and go to Cavendish      
 Junior School. I like sport generally 
 but especially ju-jitsu in which I    
 have a yellow belt and hope to get my 
 green belt soon. I collect stamps and 
 have 150 First Day Covers. I also     
 collect sticker albums and like going 
 to visit places where I can get       
 autographs of famous people. I like   
 computers, fairs and dogs but I hate  
 bananas and custard! I have got an    
 Acorn Electron computer on which I    
 play games such as 'Killer Gorilla',  
 'Escape from Moon Base Alpha' and     
 'Felix in the Factory'. I also watch  
 the television quite a bit, my        
 favourite programmes being 'He Man',  
 'Street Hawk' and 'Knight Rider'.
