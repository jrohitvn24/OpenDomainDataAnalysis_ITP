		<title>13AN ENGLISH SUNDAY</title>
		<content>On Sunday morning I get up 9.30.,get   
washed and dressed and put on my best  
clothes.I go downstairs and have my    
breakfast of cornflakes and milk and   
then have eggs and bacon and a cup of  
tea.At 10.45., I go to the Methodist   
Church and meet a lot of               
friends.Sometimes I am asked to take   
the Collection plate round.I like to do
this because it is a great honour.The  
service starts with a hymn and then    
prayers.The children leave the main    
service to go to Sunday School to learn
about the Bible.The service lasts about
one hour then we go home for dinner.We 
usually have roast meat,potatoes and   
vegetables.After dinner we watch       
television if the weather is not very  
good or we go in the car to visit      
friends or relatives or perhaps to go  
to a zoo or museum etc.
