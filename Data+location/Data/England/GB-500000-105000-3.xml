		<title>03Farming in Arundel</title>
		<content>  The well-drained land of the chalk   
 downs to the north supports{arable    
 farming and the low-lying, heavy clay 
 soils of the water meadows in the     
 south is mainly used for{dairy        
{farming.                              
  There are about 10 farms in the area,
 many being amalgamations of smaller   
 farms.  Few are privately owned, most 
 are part of the{Norfolk Estate}and    
 farmed by tenants. Typical size is    
 300-400 acres.                        
  Most farms are mixed, reflecting a   
 mixture of chalk and clay soils, but  
 with{E.E.C.}incentives, there is a    
 definite trend away from darying      
 towards arable wherever possible.     
  Dairy herds are mainly Friesian.     
 There is beef and sheep grazing. Main 
 arable crops are wheat, barley, maize,
 oats, potatoes and rape. There is some
 horticulture in the area.             </content>
