		<title>14CHASE CROSS SCHOOL</title>
		<content>  "We left for Chase Cross at 9.30a.m. 
 to ask the Headteacher some questions 
 and to look around the school.Two     
 students took us to Mr Steward's      
 office where we sat down and began to 
 ask our questions."                   
  The school stands in 38 acres,was    
 built in 1948 to hold 650 boys and 530
 girls.They were mixed in 1973.Today   
 there were 1300 pupils,with 65        
 teachers.                             
  Styles of clothes have changed, most 
 of the pupils are allowed to wear     
 stylish shirts and jackets.The sports 
 the students participate in have also 
 changed,with rock climbing,badminton  
 and tennis popular.In fact they play  
 a much greater number of games than   
 ever before.
