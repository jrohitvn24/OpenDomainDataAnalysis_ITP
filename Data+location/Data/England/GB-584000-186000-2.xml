		<title>02WORLD WIDE CHURCH OF GOD</title>
		<content> We are not Jews although we keep the  
 Sabbath and Holy Days mentioned in the
 Old Testament.Our Church began in     
 31A.D.on the day of Pentacost.We keep 
 all the Laws that God commanded in the
 Old Testament,including Tithing and   
 not eating unclean foods.             
 Friday sunset to Saturday sunset is   
 the Sabbath as it was for Jesus       
 Christ.The Holy days; after the       
 Passover and foot ceremony,are seven  
 days unleavened bread(the first and   
 last days no one works),Pentacost,Day 
 of Trumpets,Atonement and the Feast of
 Tabernacles.Then we must go away and  
 stay in caravans or hotels and attend 
 conferences.This is usually in        
 September or October.The days are     
 based on the Hebrew Calendar,not the  
 Julian Calendar used today.
