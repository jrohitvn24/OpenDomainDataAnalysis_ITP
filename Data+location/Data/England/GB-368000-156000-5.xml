 lives in the house in Camerton where  
 he was born. He attended the local    
 school until he was 13 when he began  
 work on Camerton Farm to support his  
 family whilst his father fought in    
 World War 1.At school William became  
 interested in archaeology, helping a  
 former Headmaster set up a museum.    
 Working on the farm he dug up relics  
 which led to his career.              
 His most notable find was the Camerton
 Discs-7th.C.AD bronze burial brooches.
 He worked abroad with Sir Mortimer    
 Wheeler, but mostly he has researched,
 catalogued and written on local       
 historic finds.
