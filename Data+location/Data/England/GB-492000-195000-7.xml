		<title>07AMERSHAM  GENERAL HOSPITAL</title>
		<content> The old buildings of the hospital were
 originally a work house from 1840 to  
 1930.There are 250 beds:89 for old    
 people:21 for children,8 for maternity
 and the rest for surgical and medical 
 patients.The Casualty unit had to be  
 transferred to Wycombe Hospital       
 because of difficulties in staffing.We
 visited the switchboard and recorded a
 message for Mrs Haylett (who took us  
 around.)Then we watched blood being   
 crossmatched into different blood     
 groups in the path:lab.We saw 3 babies
 born that day in maternity ;they      
 usually stay in 3 days.They had lots  
 of toys and dressing up clothes in the
 children's ward,and their parents can 
 stay with them.Then we saw the elderly
 patients, they have steps and frames  
 to practice walking again after an    
 operation.                            
                                       </content>
