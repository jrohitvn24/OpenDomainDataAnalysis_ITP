		<title>14A FEN EDGE STUD FARM</title>
		<content>   {Hare Park}Stud Farm is situated on 
 Allington Hilln in the south-east     
 corner of our survey area. It is about
 50 metres above sea-level and there is
 a thin layer of glacial gravels on top
 of the chalk.                         
    It is part of the Six Mile Bottom  
 Estate and the present farmer is the  
 tenant. It has been a stud farm for   
 over fifty years and the present      
 tenant has held it for nine years.    
    The stud farm covers 30 acres which
 are divided into 7 paddocks and a     
 stable yard. The stables are set      
 around three sides of the yard and    
 contain twenty loose boxes. They are  
 built of wood on a brick base and have
 pantiled roofs.                       
    The stud manager has no employees  
 to help him at all.
