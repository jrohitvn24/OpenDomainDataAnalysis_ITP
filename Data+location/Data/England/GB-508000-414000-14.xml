		<content> We have got a paper shop in the       
 village. It is called a paper shop    
 because they provide our newspapers.  
 It is a little shop; it sells pens and
 rubbers and things for bikes and      
 birthday things like that. When you   
 open and shut the shop door it rings a
 little bell. The people who serve you 
 are members of the Bell family,       
 they're very nice to speak to. I don't
 go there very much, my sister passes  
 the shop on her way to the bus stop.  
 She goes to Secondary School in       
 Barton. The fish and chip shop is just
 up the road from the paper shop. Not  
 very long ago some different people   
 took it over. We have a Post Office   
 where you can buy toys and cards. Next
 to it there is a shop called "Spar".  
 It is a very big shop and it sells    
 things like washing powder and        
 food.They sell toys but not much meat.</content>
