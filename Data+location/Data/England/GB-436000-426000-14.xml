		<content> Guides were formed 75 years ago by a  
 man named Baden Powell, on Saturday   
 29th of June was a celebration for 75 
 years of Guides. It took place at     
 Roundhay park.                        
 You wear a plain blue shirt with a    
 neckerchief which you tie up with a   
 toggle.                               
 To be a proper guide you have to do 8 
 good turns,then you are put to a test 
 and you have to say a motto. Guides   
 are really related to the church and  
 sometimes you talk about God. Every   
 month Guides go to church,other       
 companies go aswell but they are not  
 guides. When you are actually at      
 Guides you play games and make        
 things,you also do things in your     
 patrol like jogging,putting make up on
 and helping other people.
