 one third of the population of these  
 villages, living in private and       
 council houses and old peoples        
 bungalows. State pensions are Â£56.00  
 per week for a married couple, payable
 at a local post office. Because of the
 longer life-span, provision is made   
 for health care by doctors, nurses and
 geriatric health visitors from nearby 
 towns. Free chiropody at home, day    
 centres or local hospitals, private or
 state residential homes,together with 
 home helps and meals on wheels are all
 available.                            
   Social facilities include Over 60's 
 Club, The Royal British Legion and for
 the more active, bowling and tennis   
 clubs. The mobile library calls every 
 fortnight and there is a bus service  
 to neighbouring towns with the        
 provision of free bus tokens.         </content>
