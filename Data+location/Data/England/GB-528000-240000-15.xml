  In our block there are four methods  
 of transport. For instance cycle,walk 
 ,bus and car.If you don't have a bike 
 you walk.Most of the time my friend's 
 dad goes by car but on sunny days he  
 bikes to work,my mum bikes everywhere 
 in the village but otherwise she goes 
 by car.                               
            Steeple Morden             
  In Steeple Morden the most common    
 form of transport are walk,bike,car   
 and bus.But most of the time I see    
 people walk.                          
  This is how my family gets around:   
   My mum goes by car,my dad goes by   
 car,my sister goes by coach and car,  
 and I walk,cycle and go by car.
