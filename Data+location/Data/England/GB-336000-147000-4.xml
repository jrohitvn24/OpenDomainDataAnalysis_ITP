 In  Mark,the longest village in       
 Somerset,possibly in the country,there
 is a thriving{farming}community. There
 are around 25 to 30 farms mainly      
 dairy.The average farm size would be  
 about 150 acres &lt;60 hectares> of which
 about 100 acres would be{grassland    
 used for grazing,silage and hay for   
 the winter feeding-not for sale. A    
 typical{herd}in this area would be    
 20-25{Friesians}with 40 "followers"   
 i.e.20 home-reared calves and 20      
 yearlings. Silage-making has increased
 over the last decade as it is more    
 economical than hay to produce. On    
 farms of this size it makes sense to  
 share expensive{machinery}such as     
 combine harvesters,balers etc. A      
 familiar sight around the country     
 lanes is the blue and white milk      
 tanker collecting{milk}once daily .   </content>
