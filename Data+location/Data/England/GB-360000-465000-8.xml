		<title>08Church and Chapel, Wray</title>
		<content> There used to be four churches in     
 Wray, but now only Holy Trinity Parish
 Church, built in 1840, and the        
 Methodist Chapel, built 1848, remain  
 in use. The Quaker Meeting House is   
 now used by the Methodists, and the   
 Free Church is a private house.       
 At Holy Trinity Church, the first     
 service each month is Holy Communion, 
 the second and fourth Sundays are     
 Matins, and the third Sunday is a     
 Family Service. The vicar visits      
 people in Wray, particularly the sick 
 and lonely.                           
 The Methodist Chapel is important for 
 the many families who worship there.  
 Two services are held each Sunday, and
 a Sunday School which is well attended
 by children of all denominations. The 
 Minister does not come every Sunday.  
 In his place, there is a rota of lay  
 preachers.                            </content>
