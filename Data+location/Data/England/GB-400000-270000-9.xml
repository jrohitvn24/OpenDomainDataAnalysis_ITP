		<title>09Interview with M42 Engineer</title>
		<content>    We asked Mr Bevan why the motorway 
 was necessary, and why it had to come 
 through Alvechurch. The M42 will      
 provide the traffic needs of people   
 and goods, and was ordered by the     
 government as a result of an early    
 survey in 1970. The Alvechurch section
 of the M42 is 7 Km long and is being  
 built by Douglas, one of many firms   
 who tendered for each section. It is  
 costing 14 million pounds, has 16     
 bridges and a 20 year flexible tarmac 
 surface. The motorway will destroy 12 
 houses, 1 farm and 70 hectares of farm
 land. The embankments will be planted 
 and this will encourage wild life. The
 motorway will be cheaper to use than  
 the railway, and will save a lot of   
 time for travellers. It will also help
 to serve the growing needs of Redditch
 New Town to the South.
