		<title>16Dothill swans</title>
		<content> There have been{swans}on Dothill pools
 for at least twenty years,ever since  
 the school has been built.            
 The three{pools}are Dothill pool,Tee  
 lake and the School pool.The swans    
 often cross from Dothill pool to Tee  
 lake but they always build their nests
 and lay their eggs by Dothill         
 pool;they no longer go across to the  
 School pool because it is overgrown   
 with reeds.The swans are popular with 
 the people of Dothill who feed them   
 with bread and other titbits.In the   
 past some swans have been damaged by  
 lead weights and nylon line left      
 behind by careless anglers.This year  
 the cob and pen have reared five      
 cygnets.We hope they will nest here   
 for many years to come.
