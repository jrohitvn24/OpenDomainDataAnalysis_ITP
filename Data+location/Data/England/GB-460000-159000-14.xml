		<content> see them and they will not spoil the  
 countryside.This is how S.P.A.R.E. was
 formed.                               
    A 30 metre strip will be cut       
 through the forest and pylons would be
 put in the space,where they could be  
 seen.If the underground cables were   
 laid not as many trees would have to  
 be felled,and there would be  only \  
 metre strip.A representative from     
 S.P.A.R.E. and one from S.E.B. came to
 talk to us.They explained that it was 
 mainly a matter of money-the          
 underground cables costing Â£6m more   
 than pylons.A Public Enquiry was held,
 the results will be known in a year.  
    Most of us support S.P.A.R.E,      
 especially Mark Garvey who would have 
 a pylon in the field behind his house.
