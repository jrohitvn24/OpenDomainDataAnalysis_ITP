Mr. Clark of Moulton has 225 acres and 
400 sheep. His two breeds are          
Southdown and Suffolk Cross. He has    
lived there for 28.5 years and owns    
one welsh sheep dog called Lee. He     
grows barley, wheat and peas and sells 
most of his crops.   The land in this  
are is quite light. He feeds his       
animals on hay, turnips and            
concentrates. He gets up to feed the   
animals at six thirty every morning.   
Nearly every year he has Lamb Sunday,  
when people come and see the lambs. He 
works even on a Sunday and has one     
farm worker to help him and his        
son-in-law and daughter as well. He    
now lives in an old barn which he had  
renovated; but he landscaped the       
garden himself.
