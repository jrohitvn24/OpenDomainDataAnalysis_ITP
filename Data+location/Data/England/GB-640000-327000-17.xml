		<content>{Shopping in North Norfolk:Summary     
  This survey of shopping habits shows 
 a trend away from small village shops 
 used on a daily basis, to large       
 supermarkets,a fact which is obviously
 of significance to the small trader.  
 Present day shopping patterns are     
 geared to convience and to finding the
 most competitive prices. The influence
 of modern technology in the home, and 
 the effects of both men and women     
 working, can be seen clearly in the   
 wide range of ready-prepared foods now
 available.                            
 The influence of the car can also be  
 seen:people frequently travel 10 to 15
 miles from their home village to a    
 place of work, often in a town, where 
 large stores and supermarkets can be  
 visited conveniently during           
 lunch-times or on "late night opening"
 days.                                 </content>
