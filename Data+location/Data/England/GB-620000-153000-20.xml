		<title>20Hobbies in Adisham</title>
		<content>   Many people stated that home life,  
gardening, and looking after pets left 
little time for hobbies.  Women are    
also engaged in dressmaking, sewing and
knitting in practical ways for the home
and creatively as a hobby.  Tapestry,  
crochet, embroidery and doll making are
also undertaken.  Those families who   
support village activities helped with 
the organization of bazaars, jumble    
sales and other activities. Wives made 
craft items for sale and cooked goodies
to be eaten or sold. They also helped  
other villagers in times of trouble or 
illness.  A village magazine is pro-   
duced.  Many families do not enter into
any village activities. Music, creative
writing, book production and many forms
of art are followed.  There is at least
one professional artist and several    
talented amateurs.  All homes had tele-
vision but some preferred the radio.   </content>
