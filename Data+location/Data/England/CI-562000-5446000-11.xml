		<title>11POWER STATION,ST.HELIER</title>
		<content>   The power station is situated at La 
 Collette, close to the harbour on land
 reclaimed from the sea. It is an oil  
 fired power station. The oil arrives  
 by tanker and is then pumped into     
 storage tanks. The tanker arrives     
 every 8-10 days in winter and 15-18   
 days in the summer. Oil stocks are    
 sufficient to last for one month.     
   Three steam and four diesel powered 
 turbines produce up to 110 mega       
 watts. Sea water is used as a coolant 
 at the rate of 22,500 gallons per     
 minute.                               
   La Collette was opened in 1965,     
 replacing the Queen's Road coal power 
 station. In April 1985, a link between
 Jersey and Surville in France was     
 opened which allows cheaper           
 electricity to be imported from the   
 French National Grid.
