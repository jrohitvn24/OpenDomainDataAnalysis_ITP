		<content>  On Saturdays I usually wake up at    
 about 7 o'clock but I go back to sleep
 until 10.Then I get out of bed and    
 have a light breakfast.My friend and I
 walk down to Looe.If its a nice day,we
 go straight to the beach,sunbathe for 
 a while and when we are warmed up,go  
 into the sea.We usually meet some     
 other friends down there and we stay  
 nattering with them for quite a time. 
  We then go to a cafe and have        
 something to eat.Afterwards we just   
 walk around the town and perhaps go   
 into the shops or the arcade.At the   
 end of the afternoon,we make our way  
 up the hill to my house.              
  After tea we sometimes go to Looe    
 again to wander around,but if there's 
 something good on,we watch the box.   
  Sometimes my friend goes home,but    
 more often she stays the night with   
 us.                                   </content>
