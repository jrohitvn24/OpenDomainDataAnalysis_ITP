		<title>07Smisby - the oldest village</title>
		<content> Smisby is the oldest development in   
 our area .The village has developed   
 over the centuries.Most of the homes  
 are large detached three storey       
 buildings or cottages.The people who  
 live in these houses own them.        
 There has been council development in 
 Smisby since the 2nd World War.These  
 are mostly semi_detached houses on a  
 small estate,built with               
 brick.The houses have very small      
 gardens.                              
                                       
 After the 2nd World War many people   
 in big towns were homeless,so a lot of
 housing development took place .The   
 Goseley Estate was built near         
 Hartshorn.The houses on the estate are
 semi_detached and terraced.They are   
 built of brick and timber             
 boarding.They have very small or no   
 gardens.  (next page)                 </content>
