		<title>07INTERVIEWS WITH OLD FOLK (1)</title>
		<content>  "Cirencester is the most useful town 
 to us old people, but many can only   
 use the village shops through lack of 
 transport. The buses are a problem -  
 they're expensive and they don't come 
 very often. Some of the village shops 
 are good, but they can be expensive   
 and without much choice.              
  "There's a lot of entertainment in   
 the village: clubs, Mothers' Union,   
 and amateur dramatics in the Village  
 Hall. It's just as well, because in   
 the evening it's almost impossible to 
 get into Cirencester or Swindon       
 without your own transport. Some of   
 the clubs are specially for the old   
 people, but many of us like to mix    
 with younger friends. The churches are
 important for many old folk, and you  
 can make many new friends there.      
   "I don't mind all these new houses, 
 but I think Cerney's big enough now." </content>
