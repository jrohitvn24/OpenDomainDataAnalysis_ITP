		<title>08A Day In The Life Of Ryan</title>
		<content>  I wake up at about 6.30am.  I get up 
 and get dressed.  I go downstairs and 
 make breakfast.  I take a cup of tea  
 up for my Mum at 7.30.  At 8.00 I     
 clean my teeth and at 8.20 I set out  
 for school.                           
  I park my bike at school and then I  
 play football until 9.00 and we go in 
 for Assembly.  Assembly finishes at   
 about 9.35 and then we are told about 
 our work.  I do Maths until 10.30 and 
 then we have playtime and I play      
 football.  After play I carry on with 
 Maths until 11.30 and then I do some  
 English until 12.00.  Dinnertime lasts
 for 1 hour and we play football and   
 then come in for lessons.  I play     
 football in the next break and then   
 have Rounders if it is nice and then  
 it is time o go home.  At home we have
 tea and then watch T.V. till 9.30.  I 
 read in bed and then I go to sleep.   </content>
