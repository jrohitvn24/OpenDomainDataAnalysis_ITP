		<title>14Watford: Religion 2</title>
		<content> In addition to the christian churches,
 the last decade has seen the rise of  
 two other major religions in Watford, 
 which are expected over the next      
 decade to overtake christian worship  
 as the majority perceived religion in 
 Watford.                              
                                       
 The Muslim community has just opened a
 new mosque (Suni). The Shi'ite branch 
 have their own place of worship.      
                                       
 Sikhism is also very strong in Watford
 and represents the third major group. 
                                       
 Other groups, such as the Jewish      
 community and Greek orthodox tend to  
 travel outside Watford to worship.    
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
