  Farming in the area has moved from   
 the traditional mixed to the modern   
 intensive arable farming, although one
 predominantly dairy farm remains. Many
 farms have disappeared, some          
 amalgamating, others being purchased  
 by the Coal Board.                    
                                       
{Mining }                              
   The emphasis moved from deep mining 
 to open cast when water created a     
 problem in Snibstone pit. Although the
 pit is closed, coal is still brought  
 underground from Whitwick Pit. Open   
 cast extraction is much cheaper and   
 employs far fewer people. The coal is 
 moved by overland conveyor to the     
 railway line.
