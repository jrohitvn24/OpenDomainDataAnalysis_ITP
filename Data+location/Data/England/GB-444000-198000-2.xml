     Cothill is a small village        
consisting of approximately 15         
houses,a post office(general stores),a 
chapel and a private school .          
     POPULATION has increased slightly 
over the last 20 years.Signs on HOUSING
showed dates from 1626 to 1973.        
     Residents who had lived there all 
of their lives,felt LIFESTYLES had     
changed little.                        
    The most common SOCIAL CONCERNS    
were for:roads to be resurfaced;speed  
and weight limits for vehicles to be   
reduced;better street lighing,drainage 
and wider pavements;a gas supply;and a 
vicar for their chapel.                
    Many would like to have seen the   
"Fleur de Lys" pub. reopened,after     
nearly 2 years closed.
