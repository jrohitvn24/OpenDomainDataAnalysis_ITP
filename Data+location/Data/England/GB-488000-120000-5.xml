		<title>05TRAFFIC PROBLEMS IN MIDHURST</title>
		<content> The volume of road traffic passing    
 through Midhurst causes problems.The  
 main blocks occur where Petersfield   
 Road enters the town and at North     
 Mill.The narrowing of the road at the 
 top of North Street also causes       
 problems as does the pedestrian       
 crossing in North Street.The crossing 
 is controlled by demand and stops the 
 traffic as many as 4O times an        
 hour.The average flow of vehicles     
 through the town  in 16 hours in the  
 winter is 11,OOO.In the summer this   
 rises to 14,OOO. There were plans to  
 build a by-pass around the town in    
 196O when the money was available.It  
 would have gone from the Petersfield  
 Road round the back of the Grammar    
 School and then round Budgenor        
 Lodge.The cost would have been Â£12m.If
 the plans are revived the cost will be
 a great deal higher.                  </content>
