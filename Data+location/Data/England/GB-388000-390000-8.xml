		<title>08MODERN USES OF MILLS(2)</title>
		<content> One mill which has remained devoted to
 textile production is the Coronation  
 Mill,now owned by British Trimmings.  
  Perhaps the most interesting of the  
 old mill sites in this area is the    
 Meadow Mill,situated close to the     
 River Tame,just to the west of Tiviot 
 Way. This mill building has been      
 sub-divided into a large number of    
 smaller work units.Some of these units
 are still involved in the production  
 of various forms of fabrics,such as   
 furnishings,but these units are in the
 minority. Many different aspects of   
 industry are reflected in the nature  
 of the firms occupying the rest of the
 building. These firms are engaged in  
 such diverse activities as metal      
 spinning,engineering and the design   
 and manufacture of greetings cards.
