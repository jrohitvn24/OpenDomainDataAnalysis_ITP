		<content> The area is gently undulating,mainly  
 rural in nature with a mixture of     
 woodland and farmland with scattered  
 buildings. The two settlements are    
{Southwick Village,}an estate owned    
 village with thatched cottages and    
 very few modern buildings, in the     
 South East of the area and part of    
{North Boarhunt}in the North West,     
 consisting of 20th century housing    
 arising initially from the development
 of market gardening here prior to the 
 First World War                       
                                       
                                       
 The project was carried out by South  
 Downs College A level Geography       
 students accompanied by their         
 lecturers Olive Haughan and Margaret  
 Price.
