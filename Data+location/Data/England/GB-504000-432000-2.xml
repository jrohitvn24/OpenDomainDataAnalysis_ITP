		<content> Whoever defined the limit for block   
 05040432 could not possibly have known
 how disparate a pattern would be      
 revealed. To the extreme south west is
 the extremely affluent village of     
 Cottingham, much sought after by home 
 owners looking to higher value        
 property in pleasant surroundings.    
 From ancient beginnings, and with     
 seemingly{no planning,}a self-        
 contained community has grown up. To  
 the extreme east and north east of the
 region two phases of{planned}council  
 estate building have resulted in the  
 growth of communities which are far   
 from self-contained. The North Hull   
 and Orchard Park Estates have their   
 linkages with the City Centre ensured 
 by expensive bus routes.  Yet, to be  
 fair, houses on these two vast estates
 were eagerly sought after in their    
 early years by people in older houses.</content>
