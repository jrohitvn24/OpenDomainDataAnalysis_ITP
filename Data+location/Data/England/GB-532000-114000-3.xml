		<content> I have been connected with farming    
 since l959.My husband who was born in 
 the original farmhouse has been       
 farming all his life.His father bought
 the farm in l921 and cows have been   
 milked here since;today the farm is   
 the only one producing milk in the    
 village.The cows are loose_housed in a
 covered yard in winter and are milked 
 in a cowstall through a pipeline      
 system into a bulk tank.The milk is   
 collected daily.We grow barley and    
 oats to feed the cows and young       
 stock.Wheat is grown for the chicken  
 which are in a deep litter            
 house.Bought_in day old pullets are   
 reared as free range until they begin 
 to lay eggs.The eggs are sold         
 privately through various outlets.    
 Orphan lambs are reared on the bottle 
 then fattened for our own use.
