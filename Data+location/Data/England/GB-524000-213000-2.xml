		<content> Mr Mably, my Dad, showed us round his 
 fire station. The fire engines have   
 two-tone horns and blue lights to get 
 people out of the way. The engines can
 go 80 mph. The speed limit is 70 mph. 
 Firemen have rankings, station officer
 (in charge) sub officer (my Dad's     
 rank) and leading fireman. The rest   
 are crew. There are between four and  
 six firemen on one shift. The area    
 that the station covers is small.     
 That is because there are three other 
 stations that are nearer the motorways
 and other busy roads and villages. The
 station mainly covers WGC and the     
 factories. It has two engines. If one 
 engine is called out and there is     
 another fire, the retain go out in the
 second engine. The station has four   
 groups, Green, Blue, White and Red    
 watch. There are between five         
 and seven firemen in one watch.       </content>
