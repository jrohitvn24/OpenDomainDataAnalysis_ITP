   The tow path makes an excellent     
 footpath to see the water meadows. As 
 these are flooded regularly, the      
 farmers cannot use them in winter for 
 grazing and cannot use fertilisers    
 with the result that true meadow grass
 grows in them with lots of wild meadow
 flowers. Instead of being green, they 
 have a bufff coloured appearance with 
 lots of yellow and white flower heads 
 and patches of red poppies. On the    
 slightly higher meadows, the colour   
 was all green where fertilisers are   
 used and the farmers were cutting     
 silage and hay. The fields are divided
 by hedges and many drainage ditches.  
 In winter many duck, geese and        
 migratory birds are to be seen in this
 area.                                 
   The Coombe Hill Canal was abandoned 
 in 1876.                              </content>
