		<content> St. Mary's School has 50 pupils and is
 very small.There are only 13 people in
 our class and 2 teachers.I like our   
 class, it is nice some days. I do not 
 like homework very much.I like Maths, 
 Art, Science and Drawing.Today we     
 began our bicycle Proficiency Test.I  
 brought my bike. We learnt how to get 
 on the road and how to do a right     
 turn.                                 
   Today was a typical day in my life.I
 get up every morning at 8.15am, then I
 get dressed and go downstairs for my  
 breakfast at 8.20am. At 8.45am I go to
 school which starts at precisely      
 9am.At 10.30am it is playtime and we  
 come in at 10.45am. We have our dinner
 at 12pm and dinner play. We come in at
 1pm, at 2.20pm we have playtime to    
  2.40pm. At 3pm the Infants go home,  
 but we go home at 3.30pm. When I get  
 home I take the dogs out..            </content>
