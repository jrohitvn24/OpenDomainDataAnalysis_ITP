		<title>11Higher Brownstone Farm</title>
		<content> 15 years ago it was a dairy farm there
 was 60 cows.The farm is called Higher 
 Brownstone Farm.The farmer George used
 to collect the cows and take them into
 the milking parlour and there were six
 cows and he milked three at a time,   
 then he let them out into a place     
 called the breast stall and then they 
 climbed up into a stall and then they 
 were checked that they hadn't got any 
 diseases then they pulled on a corn   
 bar and the gate opened and the cows  
 jumped out.There were 15 young bulls  
 when George owned the farm.Because his
 boss had arthritis in his arms all the
 farm animals were auctioned.Now there 
 is a farmer who rents the farm from   
 Coleton Fishacre.                     
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
