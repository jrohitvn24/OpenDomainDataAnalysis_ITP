		<title>05HIGH HURSTWOOD MILL</title>
		<content> This used to be a forge-mill used for 
 making iron in the 16th and 17th      
 centuries but when the iron industry  
 ended it became a flour mill with the 
 miller living in the stables of the   
 nearby farm which was also built in   
 the 16th century. It has a cast-iron  
 wheel instead of the more usual wooden
 wheel to drive the mill and was made  
 by a well-known local firm in Lewes.  
 It is a small building of three       
 floors, the first of which is brick   
 and the next ones of overlapped       
 weatherboarding. The mill was worked  
 until 1941 and then the stream which  
 turned the wheel was filled with      
 reeds and therefore the work stopped. 
 The farmhouse, however, remains as a  
 very charming home and the stables are
 now garages.
