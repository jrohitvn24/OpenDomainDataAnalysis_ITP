		<title>17Schoolboy Hobbies.</title>
		<content> My favourite hobbies are swimming,    
 shooting and camping. At our school,  
 which is Slindon College, I can follow
 these hobbies easily. We have a       
 swimming pool, and are allowed to use 
 it at lunch times,weekends and        
 Activities afternoons as well as      
 during the Games lessons. There is a  
 shooting club in school, but I do not 
 use it any more, as I prefer to shoot 
 at a club in Verden in Germany where  
 my father is stationed with the Army. 
 The school goes camping most weekends 
 at Selsey in Sussex, where we can also
 canoe and do watersports with one of  
 the Games teachers. When I go camping 
 in Germany,there are very good tent   
 facilities. We get issued with        
 mosquito nets! I have never entered   
 a proper shooting contest, but when I 
 get back to Germany I will, with some 
 of the soldiers.                      </content>
