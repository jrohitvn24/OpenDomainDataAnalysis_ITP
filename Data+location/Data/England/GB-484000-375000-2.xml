		<title>02Kettlethorpe/Fenton Scenery</title>
		<content> The general landscape in the Fenton,  
 Kettlethorpe and Hardwick areas is    
 flat. The land is split into fields   
 with hedges and dykes. The village    
 of Fenton has the main Lincoln to     
 Gainsborough road passing through it, 
 which cuts the village in half. There 
 have been several new houses built in 
 the last ten to fifteen years along   
 this main road. Apart from the        
 "Carpenters Arms" public house there  
 are no amenities in the village.      
 In contrast, Kettlethorpe village is  
 situated at the end of a narrow lane  
 which leads to The Hall, a large old  
 house dating back to the 19th century.
 The parish church of St.Peter and     
 St.Paul, the old vicarage and several 
 other houses also date from this time.
 Most of the area is sparsley populated
 with isolated cottages and farm       
 houses.                               </content>
