		<title>06Quarryhead Wood and Oldstone</title>
		<content> Most of{Quarryhead wood}is            
 Ash,Sycamore and beech.As we came down
 the path we caught a glimpse of the   
 three{lakes.}                         
 We found an old{boat house.}One of the
 lakes has a{legend}that says that a   
 lady drowned her self because her     
 sweetheart could not marry her.       
{Oldstone Manor}was{burnt down}in      
 1892,the year of the Great Blizzard.It
 is a{ruin}you can still see the       
{hermit's cave}and the{tunnel}which the
 hermit went through and it came out   
 next to the manor. He came to a ledge 
 where they  left his dinner.Down on   
 the lakes they kept three swans. They 
 used the lakes for fetes and on the   
 way to the farm we went along a grass 
 road which used to be lined with      
 trees.Oldstone{Farmhouse}was mentioned
 in the{original Domesday Book}and     
 belonged to the monks of{Torre Abbey.}</content>
