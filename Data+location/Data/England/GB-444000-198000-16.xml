		<title>16 FRILFORD HEATH GOLF COURSE</title>
		<content>     GOLF is an important RECREATION in
the 1980's.Frilford Heath is one of the
county's most scenic and exclusive     
clubs.                                 
     The first CLUB dates back to the  
turn of the century,when a course was  
set up on the Wootton Road in Abingdon.
Shorly after it moved to Shippon and in
1912 to its present location at        
Frilford.                              
     The first 18 hole course was      
designed under the supervision of J.H. 
Taylor,a well-known professional of the
time.                                  
     Since then more lhas been acquired
and a further 18 hole course added.    
     The LANDSCAPE is ideal for a golf 
course,with its poor sandy,soils and a 
natural vegetation comprising largely  
of heather and gorse.
