		<title>14A Postman's Day in Hereford.</title>
		<content>                                       
   My dad is a postman. He usually     
 works in the morning, but one week    
 a month he works in the afternoon.    
   He gets up at 4 a.m. in order to    
 arrive at work at 4.30 a.m. He has a  
 cup of tea and goes to work on his    
 bike or in the car. When he arrives,  
 he usually goes into the{Sorting      
{Office}and separates the letters and  
 parcels.                              
   When the letters have been sorted he
 puts them in sacks. Some go abroad and
 the rest are for Britain. He goes     
 across the road to the{Railway Station
 and puts the sacks on the train.      
   He often goes to Much Birch and     
 delivers the letters. He arrives back 
 at the Sorting Office at 12.30 p.m.   
 and comes home at 1 p.m.
