 From 1500 I make or recieve calls from
  New York or Los Angeles' offices and 
 discuss with my colleague up dating   
 our U.S routes  performance monitoring
 system. I usually  finish work at 1800
 and arrive home at 1820. Occasionally 
 I attend meetings after work at       
 Gatwick:We eat about 1845 when we can 
 talk together as a whole family, with 
 everyone recounting the events of the 
 day. After dinner I help with the     
 washing up and getting the children   
 ready for bed. Most nights I listen to
 Mathew read then I read a bedtime     
 story. Some evenings I attend Parent  
 teacher association meetings,         
 otherwise I watch news programmes,    
 films and documentries on television  
 or read newspapers and magazines. I   
 usually go to bed at 2300.            </content>
