		<content>    An account in the Matlock Mercury  
 tells how a Matlock family endured    
 weeks of terror as their remote home  
 was plagued by a mystery-shrouded     
 U.F.O. This claim is made in a book   
 called "The Visitation"published by a 
 London publishing group.              
 It describes how the family's         
 encounter with the unknown first began
 in 1981 as they were travelling on the
 A632 towards Matlock. They saw a      
 "brilliant ovoid" which began to chase
 them and finally landed near a disused
 quarry near Blakelow Hill. The        
 distraught family phoned the Police to
 be met by a sceptical reaction. The   
 account goes on to tell of the        
 family's mounting fear over the       
 following weeks as the U.F.O. appears 
 regularly, and believing that they    
 alone had been singled out decided to 
 begin a new life elsewhere in Britain.</content>
