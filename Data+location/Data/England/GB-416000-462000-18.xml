		<content> Today, the people in the area are no  
 longer dependent on the local mills   
 for their work: some people continue  
 to work at the variety of small       
 businesses in the Glasshouses and the 
 New York Mills,but the majority of the
 other people are professionals who    
 work in Leeds, Bradford, Harrogate and
 many other large towns or cities, or  
 they work on the farms or in the local
 sevice industries.                    
 Most people have at least one car, and
 a few have two, but there is a regular
 bus service from the village to       
 Pateley Bridge and Harrogate, at the  
 weekend there is a bus to             
 Grassington,on a Thursday there is a  
 coach to Ripon for the shoppers, on a 
 Monday a bus goes to Otley market     
 and two local coach companies make    
 many local,nationwide and European    
 trips.                                </content>
