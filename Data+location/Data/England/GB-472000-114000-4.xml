		<content> Surveys of the flora and fauna were   
 made at the following{grid references:
{728174,732160,733152,734160,738162,   
{743141,744143,745155}SU71.{           
{SOIL:}In general this was found to  be
 of poor quality, being mainly chalk,  
 with flint base. Where good soil was  
 found,{grid ref.734160 }chalk subsoil 
 was still close to the surface.       
{FLORA:}The majority of the area was of
 high downland. The species found were 
 those typical to chalk downland. In   
 more fertile areas:{grid ref.728174,  
{734160 }an abundance of plant life was
 found.                                
{FAUNA:}In common with chalk downland, 
 except for considerable evidence of   
 rabbits,birds and some badgers, animal
 life  was  not  abundant. In  more    
 sheltered  areas,{grid ref.727174,    
{738162 }there  was  evidence  of      
 considerable animal activity.         </content>
