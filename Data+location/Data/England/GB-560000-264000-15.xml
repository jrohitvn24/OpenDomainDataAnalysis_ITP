		<title>15 BUILDING AGE AND MATERIALS</title>
		<content> Most of the houses in the area(Exning)
are made of brick(mainly red and       
white), with a few yellow bricked      
houses as well.The light coloured      
bricks were made in Burwell and were   
therefore cheap .There were no stone   
houses,this is because stone is not    
abundant in this area.There is little  
use of concrete.The combination of     
wood and brick is a modern             
style,though not many houses have      
it.It only appeared on Studlands       
Park,the new housing estate in         
Newmarket.During World War 2 there     
weren't many houses built because the  
materials were being used for other    
things.    The major development in    
the last 30 years has been the         
building of two large housing          
estates,these have been built on old   
stud land.They have been named         
Scaltback Estate and Studlands Park.   </content>
