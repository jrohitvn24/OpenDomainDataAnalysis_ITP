		<title>03INTERVIEWING AN OLD RESIDENT</title>
		<content>{   Mrs. Betty Kimber}has lived in     
 Bexhill for most of her life. She now 
 lives in Ardath, a{retirement home,   
 one of several in our block. She was  
 born in{Sidley}before buses ran and   
 remembers the first difficult route   
 one made up Chantry Lane, Old Town.She
 was a teacher before she got married. 
 You could not be both in the 1920's in
 the state system. However, she later  
 ran a private school in her home for  
{Swedish students.                     
    She said that the town used to be  
 very elegant because there were many  
{private schools}and fine hotels then. 
 An Indian prince once had a grand     
 funeral procession here.{General      
{education}and{facilities}for ordinary 
 children were better now she thought, 
 although it was less crowded then and 
 perhaps more friendly in her younger  
 days.                                 </content>
