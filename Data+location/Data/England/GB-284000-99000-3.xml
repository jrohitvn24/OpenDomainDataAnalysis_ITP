		<title>03Shobrooke Village</title>
		<content> We went to Shobrooke Village. The     
 church there is called St Swithin's   
 church and the Holy Well is locked    
 nearby.                               
 The private school there was once     
 behind the church then it moved to    
 School Close and then it was put on   
 the corner of the triangle.           
 Shobrooke Park was once called Fulford
 Park by the owners but a man died and 
 the funeral directors went to the     
 wrong Fulford Park (as there was      
 another Fulford Park near Tedburn St  
 Mary) so they changed this Fulford    
 Park to the name Shobrooke Park.      
 Shobrooke is sometimes called Little  
 Silver because of the river and       
 sometimes Shobrooke because of the    
 bridge over the brook. Shobrooke has  
  about 50 houses, 1 post office, 1 pub
 and a garage with services plus old   
 peoples home and a private school.    </content>
