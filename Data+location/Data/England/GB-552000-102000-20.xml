		<title>20Lullington Church</title>
		<content> Lullington Church stands on a hill    
 above the River Cuckmere. It can be   
 reached by way of the White Bridge    
 near Alfriston Church,a pleasant walk 
 taking about fifteen minutes. It is   
 one of the smallest churches in the   
 country. The church was damaged by    
 fire and only half of it now remains. 
                                       
 It is now united with Alfriston Church
 and services occur at regular periods.
