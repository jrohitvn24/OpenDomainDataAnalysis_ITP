		<title>12A Farm Visit</title>
		<content> Stuart Baird from Green Park Primary  
 School visited Highway Farm Lydiate   
 with the rest of his class.           
 "When we went to Highway Farm we got a
 bit lost but when we got there i asked
 a few questions.Mr Harrison,the farmer
 told me that the farm was about 200   
 years old.He said that there were some
 interesting out buildings,some as old 
 as the farm,they had no windows and   
 were used for milking cows.           
 The farmer mostly grew crops but they 
 also had 2 cows and 2 dogs.The 2 cows 
 are beef cattle which means they give 
 meat.When we walked round the farm we 
 saw potatoes,barley,cabbages and      
 cauliflower growing.The main enemy to 
 the crop is the Colorado beetle which 
 eats and puts disease on the potatoes.
 After I had been to the farm I went   
 home."
