		<content> Our block covers a mainly rural area  
 on a ridge between the towns of       
 Penistone and Stocksbridge.           
 However,some large industrial         
 concerns are found in our block. These
 are,the Conoco Oil Terminal, Fox's    
 Wire Ltd. part of British Steel's     
 Stocksbridge Works, and British       
 telecoms Hunshelf mast,which          
 is being built. Our school is just out
 of our block as is most of the        
 village. Although the area is mainly  
 rural, the industrial concerns are    
 very important economically. Many of  
 the peolpe who live in our area work  
 in the towns of{SOUTH YORKSHIRE.}The  
 space of the {PEAK DISTRICT}is as     
 close as the amenities of {SHEFFIELD  
{AND BARNSLEY.}
