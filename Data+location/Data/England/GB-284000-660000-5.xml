		<title>05COAL MINING</title>
		<content> There have been over 20 coalmines in  
 the immediate area of Shotts.         
    All these 'pits' are now closed.   
 The coal seams worked vary in         
 thickness from 16 to 48 inches:40 to  
 120 cm. Due to the thin seams and     
 difficult geology the mines were never
 highly mechanised.                    
 Pit ponies were used.The only coal    
 being extracted now is in opencast    
 sites operated by contractors.        
 Some of the moorland has been         
 superficially changed by this work ,as
 the overburden has been replaced and  
 seeded,or in some part planted with   
 conifers.Some drainage has also been  
 done.                                 
 Many street names commemorate old     
 mines e.g:BATON,BELMONT,FORTISSAT,    
 HILLHOUSERIGG,RIMMON,NORTHFIELD,      
 STARRYSHAW,HIRST.
