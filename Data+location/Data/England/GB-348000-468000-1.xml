		<content>   This area, including{Carnforth,     
{Bolton-le-Sands}and{Nether Kellet}is  
 situated on the southern shore of     
{Morecambe Bay.}Bordered by sea and    
 salt flats to the west, limestone     
 hills to the north, the{Vale of Lune }
 to the east and{Lancaster}to the south
 it is within easy reach of some of the
{most beautiful country in the North   
{West,}within 30 mins drive of the{Lake
{District}and offers marvellous views  
 across the bay, especially at sunset. 
   Mentioned in the first{Domesday Book
 the area is steeped in history, but   
 does not live in the past. Even though
 some industries have closed new ones  
{(Nuclear Power and Off-Shore Gas)}have
 taken their place &amp; domestic building 
 continues to grow. Close to the{M5}and
{main rail routes}it is within easy    
 reach of northern towns and cities and
 is a popular{holiday area.}           </content>
