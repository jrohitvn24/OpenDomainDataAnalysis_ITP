		<content>    The Hams Hall centre was opened in 
 1975 following several years of       
 converting the site into a nature     
 reserve &amp; educational centre. The area
 chosen for the classroom &amp; wardens    
 office was originally the walled      
 garden of the Hams Hall Country Estate
 . A teacher warden is employed to     
 ensure that full benefit is gained    
 from educational visits.              
    Church Pool Covert is the main     
 study area &amp; is rich in many varieties
 of flora &amp; fauna. Various trails are  
 planned out for visitors.             
    Many recently planted trees were   
 to replace trees lost through Dutch   
 Elm Disease.                          
    The cost of running the centre is  
 shared by Birmingham City Council,    
 Warwicksire County Council &amp; Solihull 
 Metropolitan Borough Council.
