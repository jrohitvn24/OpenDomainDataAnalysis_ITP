		<title>13CHURCHES AT HEATHER</title>
		<content> The Church Patronal Festival has been 
 revived and this year will be enhanced
 by a Flower Festival and parade of    
 youth Organisations.  In March 1828 a 
 piece of land was purchased from      
 Benjamin Bradley of Heather by        
 Trustees appointed from the Ashby     
 Wesleyan Circuit.  It cost four       
 shillings.  The release document      
 reads, "It is intended shortly to     
 build a Chapel for the worship of     
 Almighty God."  Wesley Chapel was     
 built at a cost of Â£250.  The         
 Methodist Church in Heather had begun.
  A further plot of land was bought in 
 1898 for a Schoolroom.  This was built
 alongside for "less than Â£100".  More 
 recent additions have been a font,    
 kitchen facilities, clock, an         
 Anniversary platform and flower       
 pedestal.
