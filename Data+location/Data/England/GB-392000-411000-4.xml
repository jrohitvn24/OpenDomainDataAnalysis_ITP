		<content>   The farms of the area are mainly    
 pastoral.{Dairy farming}is the main   
 commercial activity. This may prove to
 be less important in the future as a  
 result of recent E.E.C. moves to cut  
 down on milk production. Several farms
 use some of their grazing for horses, 
{horse riding}being a popular leisure  
 pursuit particularly with young girls.
 Fenns Farm has been given over        
 entirely to stables.                  
   Moorbank Farm is fairly typical of  
 farms in the area. It was built in    
 1632 and now has a Dutch barn and a   
 cattle shed in addition to the        
 farmhouse. The land-use is mainly     
 improved grass, some of which is used 
 to provide hay for winter fodder. The 
 fields vary in size from 3 to 10 acres
 The farmer employs only one part-time 
 worker. The livestock consists of 50  
 Fresian cows, 3 goats and 5 horses.   </content>
