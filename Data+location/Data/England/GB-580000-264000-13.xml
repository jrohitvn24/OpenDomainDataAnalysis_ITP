		<content> For many years Bury St. Edmunds was   
the headquarters of the Suffolk (later 
Royal Anglian) Regiment. Its part in   
victory at the battle of Minden against
the French in 1769 is commemorated in  
the name of the "Minden Rose" public   
house, a reminder that when advancing  
to battle the men picked roses to wear 
in their hats.                         
  Their exploits are also recalled in  
the names of roads:- Minden Drive,     
Detingen Way and Gibraltar Close.      
Much of the former Blenheim Army Camp  
is now the Blenheim Industrial Estate, 
consisting mainly of warehouses. Part  
of the area is used by the Territorial 
Army and the cadet force.              
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
