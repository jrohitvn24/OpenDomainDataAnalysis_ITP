		<content> On the west side of Tisbury most of   
 the houses are made from brick. There 
 is an old peoples home at Nadder Close
 where the old people live in          
 bungalows. On Monmouth Hill some new  
 houses are being built by Persimmon   
 Homes. These are mainly of brick.     
 There are some bungalows also. Most of
 the properties on this estate are     
 detached.                             
   At the top of Churchill Estate the  
 houses are covered in pebble dash,    
 at the bottom of this council estate  
 the houses are of brown brick.        
   The vast majority of the housing in 
 our area is situated in Tisbury and   
 most are very old.                    
   Most of the houses outside of       
 Tisbury are farm houses or cottages.  
   Walking around our area houses of   
 almost every kind and built of every  
 material can be found.                </content>
