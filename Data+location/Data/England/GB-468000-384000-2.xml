		<content> Sutton has one main street with the   
 pub where they serve meals as well as 
 drinks and the Post Office round a    
 triangular village green.  There is a 
 church which was built in the         
 fourteenth century with a small       
 graveyard and it is surrounded by     
 trees. There is a general store which 
 sells food and other household items. 
 There is a modern primary school      
 surrounded by a housing estate.  The  
 village hall has a play area behind it
 which has a tennis court, some swings 
 and a small area of grass.  Across the
 road from the church there is a small 
 black-smith's which sells lawnmowers  
 etc. and mends things.  There is a    
 riding school with eight horses and   
 you can have lessons at the weekends. 
 Down the main street the houses are   
 mostly old.  Sutton has got 286 houses
 and every night the lights go on.     </content>
