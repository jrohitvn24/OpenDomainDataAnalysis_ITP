		<title>08Fire and Ambulance Station</title>
		<content> The Fire Station is on the corner of  
 Albert Rd. and Court Rd. At Southport 
 there are 3 full time engines and a   
 turntable ladder that is 27 years old.
 In an appliance, that weighs 7840 kg  
 unladen and costs Â£60 000, 14 men can 
 be carried. To become a fireman you   
 must be over 18. The station handles  
 1700 calls per year.                  
 The Ambulance Station is behind the   
 fire station. All calls are handled by
 the Control at Whiston, on the Wirral.
 We sat in an ambulance and put a      
 plastic splint on our arm that had to 
 be blown up.A loud bell rings in the  
 station when there is an emergency.If 
 there was a fire at one of Southport's
 big hotels fire engines and ambulances
 would have to be brought in from      
 outside the area. In an emergency they
 can get to Ainsdale in less than seven
 minutes.                              </content>
