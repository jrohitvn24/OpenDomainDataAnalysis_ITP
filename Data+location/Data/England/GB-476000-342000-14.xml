		<title>14Events in the villages.</title>
		<content> Two of the villages in the area did   
 hold special events regularly.Firstly 
 Alverton its population of no more    
 than 20 residents revived the Alverton
 feast which is held September.This    
 celebration includes music and drama  
 in the form of a parade,pageant and   
 concert in Staunton church which has  
 close links historically.The whole    
 community eat together in 1 of        
 Alvertons larger houses.Shelton       
 instituted a tulip festival some years
 ago where the whole village was       
 covered by growing tulips and by      
 flower head displays showing village  
 life.The event was started to raise   
 money for the church and was so       
 successful that it was made an annual 
 event for several years,but the people
 found the event strenuous and stopped 
 it recently but the bulbs continue to 
 flower still causing interest.        </content>
