		<title>15WHALTON'S HISTORIC BUILDINGS</title>
		<content> Most of the houses in Whalton are 19th
 century in origin. The exceptions are:
{The Manor House:}The 17th century     
 houses which make up the present Manor
 House were converted and extended by  
 Sir Edwin Lutyens in 1908. Gertrude   
 Jekyll helped to design the gardens.  
{Ogle Castle:}Built in the 14th century
 it is now a beautiful private house   
 surrounded by a double moat which was 
 renovated in Victorian times.         
{The Old Rectory:}Built around a Pele  
 Tower, it acted as the rectory for St.
 Mary Magdalene until 1958 when the red
 brick rectory was built beside the    
 church. Until the forties a foot      
 bridge led from its garden to the     
 church, the stone steps of which can  
 still be seen.                        
{Moore House: }A large family house    
 built in the 17th century for the     
 Moore family.                         </content>
