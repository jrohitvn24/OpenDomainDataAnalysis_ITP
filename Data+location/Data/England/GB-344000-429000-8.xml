Included here are whist and domino     
drives, beetle drives, bingo, discos,  
autumn or spring fairs, coffee         
mornings, garden parties and wine and  
cheese evenings. These are usually run 
by the various parish organizations,   
either for charity or their own funds  
and are held either in the Village Hall
or Newton School.Most are occasional;  
thewhist and domino drives are weekly  
but the garden parties are annual      
 events. THE ARTS                      
There are practically no entertainments
of this kind; the Duke's Playhouse     
from  Lancaster have performed plays   
in Newton School from time to time, but
they have been poorly attended.        
INSTRUCTIONAL                          
This overlaps adult education to a     
point;the Flower Arranging classes and 
the Local History talks come into this.</content>
