		<content> High Ham is the only village in the   
 area to have a shop or a Post Office. 
 The shop sells a variety of goods     
 including sweets,groceries &amp; hardware.
 The small Sub-Post Office also sells  
 cards and stationery. 9 mobile shops  
 visit the area: a grocer comes on     
 Mondays; a milkman delivers fresh milk
 on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays;   
 newspapers are delivered daily by van;
 a baker comes on Tuesdays, Thursdays  
 and Saturdays; a butcher delivers on  
 Wednesdays and Saturdays; eggs are    
 delivered on Wednesdays, fish on      
 Fridays &amp; greengroceries on Saturdays.
 The library van comes on Wednesdays   
 and signals by tooting his horn. Of   
 the 100 households surveyed 50-60% use
 the milkman, newsagent and baker, 25% 
 use the grocer and less than 10% use  
 the greengrocer, butcher, fishmonger  
 and the library.                      </content>
