		<title>11HOPES &amp; FEARS,DRAYTON AREA</title>
		<content>    When interviewed,the main hope     
 expressed by people in the village was
 that{Drayton}should maintain its      
 identity and not become engulfed by   
 the new development,linking several   
 areas into one{homogenous suburb}of   
{Norwich.                              
    Locally,a{dispute}has recently     
 arisen between the{Church}and the     
{Parish Council}over a proposed        
 extension to the Church,providing a   
 Sunday school and a meeting room.     
 Objections are against the moving of  
 graves and the lack of available      
 parking space.                        
    Another bone of contention is the  
{division of the village}by the        
 Fakenham road,which has split the     
 village into two halves,the green and 
 the old village being isolated from   
 the new developments,and the village  
 losing much of its former cohesion.   </content>
