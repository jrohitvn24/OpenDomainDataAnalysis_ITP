		<content>{Crowan School}is no longer in         
 Crowan. It is now in the village      
 of Praze-an-Beeble.                   
 The school was built in 1890.         
 About one and a half miles            
 up the road are three{reservoirs.     
 They each hold 30.5 million           
 gallons of water.   They are 520      
 feet above sea level.   They          
 service Crowan Village, Praze         
 Village, Leedstown Village,           
 Clowance and Drym hamlets.   When     
 water is short during the summer      
 they only serve Crowan village.       
 The system is 120 years old but in    
 a few years time these reservoirs     
 will be closed.   The water will      
 then be supplied from Stithians.      
 Up the road from the reservoirs is    
 the hamlet of Blackrock.   There      
 used to be a chapel but it is a       
 dwelling house now.                   </content>
