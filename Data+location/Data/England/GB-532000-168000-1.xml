		<content>   In our area the housing is very     
 mixed.                                
 Some of these have been converted into
 flats which are either rented or      
 privately owned. Others have fallen   
 into disrepair. These are gradually   
 being renovated but some have been    
 demolished. There are also some       
 terraced houses  built in the 1930's. 
   There are also blocks of flats in   
 our area. One of these has only       
 recently been completed. Many flats   
 have only two rooms which is a problem
 for young families. In many cases     
 there are no lifts which is a problem 
 for the elderly. Generally there is a 
 lack of community feeling in this     
 area. This is because many people     
 commute to the centre of London. Often
 people do not know their neighbours   
 and some people feel isolated and     
 lonely.                               </content>
