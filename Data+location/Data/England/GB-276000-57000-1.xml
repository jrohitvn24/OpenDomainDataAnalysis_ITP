		<title>01The 12Km. around Harberton</title>
		<content> Our survey covers a rural area around 
 the small village of Harberton, about 
 two miles from the country town of    
 Totnes.                               
                                       
 The economy of the area is based on   
 farming and tourism, but most aspects 
 of daily life for most people depend  
 on facilities outside the area.       
                                       
 The landscape is undulating, gently   
 rolling hills, valleys, small woods   
 and copses, rivers and streams, a     
 patchwork of lush green fields and    
 rich red soil - picture book Devon    
 countryside.                          
                                       
 The area is situated between the hills
 of Dartmoor and the coast of South    
 Devon. The main road between Totnes   
 and the coastal towns of Kingsbridge  
 and Dartmouth runs through the area.  </content>
