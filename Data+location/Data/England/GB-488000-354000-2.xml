		<content> A new four classroom CE/Methodist     
 Primary School was completed in August
 1984. This replaced two former schools
 -a Methodist Infant School which is   
 now used by the village playgroup and 
 a CE Junior School which is currently 
 up for sale.The new school was in use 
 from the Autumn Term 1984 and was     
 officially opened on December 7th.    
 1984 by the principal of Bishop       
 Grosseteste College, Lincoln.         
     Two PTA events were organised     
 during the Summer Term 1985 - a       
 Children's Fancy Dress Barbecue and a 
 Games Evening where adults and        
 children took part in ten games and   
 amassed as many points as possible.   
 Some junior children spent a week near
 Ironbridge and the  infants spent a   
 day at Caythorpe Agricultural         
 College.The school came second        
 in the local area sports at Claypole. </content>
