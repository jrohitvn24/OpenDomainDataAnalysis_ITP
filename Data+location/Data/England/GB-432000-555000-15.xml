		<title>15THE MAYOR OF SUNDERLAND</title>
		<content> On Mon.17th June 1985 the Mayor of    
 Sunderland,Mr.Ralph Baxter, visited   
 our school. He is a new Mayor and he  
 lives in S.Hylton. We asked him some  
 questions. We discovered that he      
 became Mayor on May 15th 1985. He is  
 Mayor for one year. He worked in the  
 shipyards before he was Mayor.        
 S.Hylton school was the first school  
 he had visited. He is the first Mayor 
 of Sunderland to live in S.Hylton and 
 he has lived here for 18 yrs. He      
 thinks that the Domesday survey is an 
 excellent idea because he says that   
 until you know where you come from it 
 is difficult to know where you are    
 going. He describes his job as Mayor  
 as promoting the area of Sunderland to
 encourage trade. His job keeps him    
 busy nearly every day of the week but 
 in his spare time he reads.
