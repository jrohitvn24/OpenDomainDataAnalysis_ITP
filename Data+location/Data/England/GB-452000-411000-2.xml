		<content> Campsmount is a mixed comprehensive,  
 serving our local area.               
   This school runs from 8.30am _      
 3.10pm. Our dinner hour lasts an hour 
 and midmorning break a quarter of an  
 hour . We do not have an afternoon    
 break.                                
   We are allowed packed lunches or    
 paid school meals (at Â£3.00 per week )
 or free meals and we may leave school 
 for our meals.                        
   We may sign ourselves in if we are  
 late and if we wish to leave early we 
 must obtain a letter from a teacher.  
 We can take it to the office and      
 leave.                                
   There are 7x40 minute lessons per   
 day, some doubles.                    
   Campsmount overlooks some beautiful 
 scenery, but also Askern pit.         
   Some pupils come from Norton,       
 Askern, Campsall, Fenwick, Smeaton.   </content>
