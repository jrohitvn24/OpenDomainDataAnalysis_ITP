		<content>{   Grotto Wood :}The word 'grotto'    
 means an imitation cave. Thus it is   
 possible that in the woods are caves, 
 possibly man-made ones, or perhaps    
 they were used as kilns. It could be  
 that the name is romantic and merely  
 pertains to a fairy grotto or         
 delightful place.                     
   {Lance Beck :}'Lance comes from the 
 Old English 'hlinc'. This means the   
 ledges of rising ground ie 'linces'.  
 Thus 'Lance Beck' comes from the      
 stream bordering the linces.          
   {Mense House :}There are two        
 possible meanings to this 'mense'     
 means graceful or decorative. Thus the
 name could mean a fine and grand house
 or it could come 'manse'. A manse     
 house is a house occupied by a church 
 minister. This word occurs mainly in  
 Scotland and does in most cases refer 
 to the Scotish Presbyterian Church.   </content>
