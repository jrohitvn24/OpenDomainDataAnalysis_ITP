		<title>14CUSTOMS-GOTHAM CHURCH BELLS</title>
		<content>   The church of St Lawrence has five  
 bells.The lightest bell is the        
 treble,which was made in Loughborough 
 in 1910.The second bell dates from    
 the same time.The third bell was cast 
 in 1658 whilst the fourth and tenor   
 are even older,and date back to       
 1598.The three heavier bells were all 
 cast in Nottingham.                   
    The bell-word 'tenor' comes from   
 the word 'teller'.In the olden days   
 they used the teller to announce when 
 someone had died.They rang one chime  
 for a boy,two for a girl,three for a  
 man and four for a woman.After an     
 interval of five seconds,they rang out
 the age and the date of death.        
    During the war years they were only
 allowed to ring the bells when there  
 was an air-raid,but today bells are   
 rung for weddings,special occasions   
 and to call people to church.         </content>
