		<title>19ALKHAM VILLAGERS ATTITUDES.</title>
		<content> The villagers of Alkham were          
 questioned about their life-styles and
 attitudes.Most chose to live in the   
 village because of the beautiful and  
 peaceful countryside and the friendly 
 village atmosphere,many had lived in  
 the village for most of their lives   
 while others chose to retire to       
 Alkham.Of the working inhabitants most
 travelled to Dover or Folkestone by   
 car to pursue their careers.The local 
 bus service was used by a few         
 villagers regularly for shopping or to
 get to work or school, but most used  
 it only occasionly or not at all.     
 Shopping expeditions were equally     
 divided between Dover or Folkestone.  
 Most villagers listed gardening as    
 their main hobby,with sports such as  
 swimming and horse riding other       
 favourite uses of spare time.Reading  
 was popular amongst the elderly.      </content>
