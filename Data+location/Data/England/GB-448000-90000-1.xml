		<title>01Summary Of The Area.</title>
		<content>  This is mainly  an area of           
 enclosed fields between Newport,the   
 principal town in the island, to the  
 south and the coastal towns of Cowes  
 and East Cowes to the north with      
 Parkhurst Forest to the west. There is
 cosiderable ribbon development along  
 the roads from Newport.The principal  
 development is the three island       
 prisons and associated staff housing  
 in the southwest corner of the area.  
 Here too is ST.Mary's Hospital complex
 and The Isle Of Wight Colllege Of Arts
 And Technology. The River Medina,     
 rising in the south of the island,    
 flows to Newport and continues through
 the area as a navigable waterway to   
 Cowes harbour.Considerable use is made
 of the river for recreational         
 purposes and too the track of the old 
 railway line that ran alongside.
