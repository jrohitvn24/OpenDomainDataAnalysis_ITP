		<title>13COIT SCHOOL DINNERS</title>
		<content> Coit school dinners are cooked on the 
 premises.The dinners vary every day of
 the week there are usually healthy    
 food,for example salad,potatoes and   
 vegetables.we only have chips once a  
 week and not very often have battered 
 fish .We like to eat chips,fish       
 fingers and fishcake,and toffee       
 tart.The dinner ladies insist that we 
 try everything but we don't always    
 like it.The dinner ladies bring trays 
 of food and the older children serve  
 it out.There is a big kitchen where   
 they cook food.The dinner ladies who  
 do not work in the kitchen wipe the   
 tables and generally supervise the    
 children.Also we don't enjoy eating   
 new potatoes every day of the week.
