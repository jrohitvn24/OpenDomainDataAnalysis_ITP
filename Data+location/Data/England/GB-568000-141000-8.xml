 This Goat Farm comprised 15 acres     
 giving employment to both husband and 
 wife as yet no other employees

 selling goat products directly to the 
 consumer at the farm gate             
 Several properties in the whole area  
 sell their home grown produce at the  
 gate ranging from very sofisticated   
 shop style buildings to a table with a
 cardboard box for the money
