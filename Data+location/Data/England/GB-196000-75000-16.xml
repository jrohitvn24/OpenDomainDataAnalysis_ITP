		<title>16St Minver Over Sixties Club</title>
		<content> The{Over Sixties Club}was founded in  
{1961}by the present leader of the     
 club. Weekly meetings are held every  
 Tuesday at the{Perceval Institute,}St 
 Minver except the last Tuesday in the 
 month when a trip is organized. There 
 is no membership fee but members pay  
 10p every week which includes tea and 
 biscuits. At the meetings they have a 
{keep fit lesson}for 20 minutes and    
 they also play Scrabble and discuss   
 things. The number of people in the   
 club varies every week for obvious    
 reasons. The Over Sixties raise money 
 by jumble sales,mini markets,sales of 
 produce and a handicraft sale.Their   
 fixed winter activities include: a    
 pantomime,a Christmas dinner and a    
 birthday party at the St Moritz Hotel,
 Trebetherick not to mention the annual
 concert by the{local primary school   
 choir.                                </content>
