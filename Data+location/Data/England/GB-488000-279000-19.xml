		<title>19Lorna's day in Kettering</title>
		<content>  Lorna is 11 years old and lives in a 
council house situated on Kettering's  
Grange Estate.  At home there is just  
Mum and Lorna's two brothers.  Many of 
her friends are in a similar situation 
or have a step parent.                 
  She doesn't like her street much as  
there is too much rubbish about and    
many people do not look after their    
houses too well.                       
  Her school day begins at 7a.m.  After
breakfast her friend calls and together
they go to school calling at Grange    
shops for sweets on the way.  She gets 
55p pocket money each week.            
   School is Â£all right' and so are the
children and staff.  She doesn't like  
using the school computer!  At the end 
of school she often dawdles home.      
    In the evening she may play with a 
friend or most likely watch T.V. or a  
video film.  Bed is 10p.m. or later!   </content>
