		<title>07Railway tunnel and viaduct.</title>
		<content> The tunnel is 742 yards long.It had   
 all kinds of trains going through.The 
 same sort of engines went over the    
 viaduct,which is 35 feet long.This    
 viaduct was finished in 1860 and a few
 years later the line from Salisbury to
 Yeovil was completed.They had problems
 with the tunnel.Bricks were used to   
 line the clay.In the early 1920's it  
 was decided to take out some bricks   
 and build an arch for strength.They   
 had no more problems. The last steam  
 engine on the viaduct and through the 
 tunnel was in 1964 apart from special 
 trips for steam enthusiasts. The track
 has been changed five or six times.The
 ballast comes from Okehampton in      
 Devon.
