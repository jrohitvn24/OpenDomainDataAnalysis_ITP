		<title>16HOBBIES IN LAINDON</title>
		<content> My hobby is going in for competitions.
 I am quite good at them. Some of the  
 competitions I enter are at{Radio     
{Basildon}near the town centre, at the 
 basement of Brooke House.             
 My friend Carol, goes to music every  
 Friday. She plays the clarinet at     
 Woodlands school. She has three       
 lessons. Each lesson lasts half an    
 hour.                                 
 Sarah, another friend collects        
 spoons.Some of them have politicians  
 on them, or Prince Charles and Diana, 
 windmills and lacemakers. You can get 
 spoons with nearly everybody  on, even
 Wham! She has 13 spoons and she keeps 
 them on a special rack.               
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
