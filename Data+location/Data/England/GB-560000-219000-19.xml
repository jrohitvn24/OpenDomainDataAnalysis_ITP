		<title>19The Dunmow Flitch (History)</title>
		<content>   The Dunmow Flitch is a very old     
 custom. It probably started when      
 Little Dunmow Priory gave a prize of  
 bacon to people who were willing to go
 through a religious ceremony of       
 marriage.                             
   There were awards of bacon in the   
 16th Century, but in 1536 Henry closed
 the monastries down and the custom    
 died. It was revived by the local lord
 of the manor in 1701, but by 1751 the 
 custom died again. A Victorian author 
 W Harrison Ainsworth, wrote a novel   
 called the Flitch of Bacon, and in    
 1855 he revived the trials as a       
 publicity stunt, using the old Town   
 Hall in Dunmow.                       
   The custom has continued ever since,
 with gaps for the two World Wars, and 
 has settled into a pattern of once    
 every four years, the last time being 
 1984.                                 </content>
