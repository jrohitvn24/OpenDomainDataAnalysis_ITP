		<title>08ARTISTS IN ST.IVES .</title>
		<content>  Since visits, in the late 19th       
 century by painters such as Whistler  
 and Sickert,St.Ives has had an{artists
{colony}.Attracted by the light,       
 landscape and atmosphere St.Ives has  
 been both home and inspiration to     
 artists of national and international 
 repute.                               
  Today both painters and sculptors    
 work in{figurative}and{abstract       
 styles. Their studios (some one time  
 net-lofts) are mainly in the Porthmeor
 area. Their work is exhibited in the  
{Penwith}and{New}galleries, as well as 
 in smaller private galleries.         
  The{Tate}gallery now administers the 
 studio and sculpture garden of Dame   
 Barbera{Hepworth},and the studio      
 pottery of Bernard{Leach}still        
 flourishes.                           
  In 1985 the Tate Gallery held an     
 exhibition of St.Ives art.            </content>
