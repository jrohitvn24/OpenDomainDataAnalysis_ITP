		<title>02Dorset River</title>
		<content> The river Stour though known as the   
 Dorset river begins life as several   
 springs in the extesive grounds of    
 Stourhead Houses, 4km into            
 neighbouring Wiltshire .When just into
 Dorset, its waters are swelled  by the
 rivers Shreen and Lodden.The three    
 rivers form part of the local town    
 badge.The Stour is well bordered by   
 trees such as oak,blackthorn,willow   
 and ash.The recent outbreak of Dutch  
 Elm disease killed hundreds of Elm    
 trees and effected water levels.The   
 birds that live beside the river are  
 mainly moorhen and yellow Wagtail,    
 with the accasional vivid blue flash  
 of the Kingfisher,Otters have         
 flourished here for hundreds of years 
 but nowadays they are a rare sight.
