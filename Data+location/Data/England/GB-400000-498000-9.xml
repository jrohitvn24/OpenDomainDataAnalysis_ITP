		<title>09HEALTH AND CARE IN REETH.1</title>
		<content>{Dr Bell}looks after most of the people
 in the grid area.He has a Surgery in  
{Reeth}which is held twice a day on    
 most days and he has one day off a    
 week.His area extends as far as the   
 county boundaries of Durham and       
 Cumbria,and he estimates that he      
 travells about 200 miles a week       
 visiting patients.                    
        {Dr Bell}is rather unusual in  
 that he has to dispense most of the   
 medicines himself.His wife also helps 
 with this.This is because the nearest 
 Chemist is about 12 miles away.In     
 addition he sometimes carries out     
 minor operations in the               
 surgery.Getting blood samples to the  
 hospital is one of his most difficult 
 tasks.He says that he likes the       
 "helping" part of his job,but does not
 like the isolation of it.PTO p.18
