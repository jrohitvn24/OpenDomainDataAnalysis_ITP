		<title>19Little Wellhouse Farm.</title>
		<content>       This farm has been the home of  
 the same family since the Great War of
 1914.The main house is over 300 years 
 old and it used to be the place where 
 the pig food was kept.The house like  
 most of the other buildings is of     
 timbered structure and has been well  
 preserved.The most worrying moment    
 within the house was probably when a  
 little owl got stuck down the chimney.
        The farm can be reached by     
 turning off Blackshots Lane opposite  
 William Edwards playing fields.There  
 is a pond on the approach to the farm 
 where willow trees have been planted. 
 Here,sparrows,starlings,blackbirds,   
 thrushes and moorhens can be seen.The 
 pond itself is hundreds of years old  
 and contains frogs and newts.In the   
 past this pond was used to drain the  
 farmland,but this is not the case     
 today.                                </content>
