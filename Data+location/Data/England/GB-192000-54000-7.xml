 the primary school which is situated  
 on the road to St.Stephen. There are  
 37 children in the school and two     
 full-time teachers. Children are aged 
 between five and eleven. The building 
 is old - it was built in 1900 for a   
 cost of Â£1500. The toilets are outside
 at the bottom of the playground.There 
 is a field with soccer posts and      
 although there are no trees at present
 many trees and shrubs are to be       
 planted during the coming winter. It  
 is also planned to improve and extend 
 the school garden. School starts at   
 9.00a.m. and finishes at 3.00p.m.     
 Lunch break is from 12.00 till 1.00.  
 The school meals (65p)are cooked at   
 St.Dennis Junior School. Quite a lot  
 of children bring a packed lunch. This
 year the school obtained a computer-  
 just in time to compile this survey!  </content>
