		<title>05BURGHLEY: WASH DYKE POND</title>
		<content> We started at the Kitchen Garden      
 entrance to Burghley Park off Barnack 
 Drift.We went west to Wash Dyke       
 Pond.We had to go through a mixed     
 woodland.On the south side it was     
 deciduous and on the north side it    
 was coniferous.On the north side under
 the conifers was bracken.The path     
 that we went on was rough and slightly
 hilly.The woodland was dense but had a
 pleasent smell.It had a secluded      
 atmosphere.We came out of the wood and
 looked over at some very large trees  
 forming an avenue.We found them in a  
 book to be Sweet Chestnuts.We went on 
 and arrived at Wash Dyke Pond.        
 Unfortunately there was no wildlife on
 the pond.We went from here to the     
 Kitchen Gardens.
