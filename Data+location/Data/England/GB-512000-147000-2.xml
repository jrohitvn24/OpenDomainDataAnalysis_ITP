		<title>02WESTCOTT LANDSCAPE</title>
		<content>{     }The Westcott area was covered in
 swamps, salt lakes and lagoons.       
 Dinosaurs roamed here and ferns,      
 conifers and horsetails grew here.    
 Millions of years later Dorking became
 covered in fresh water which gave us a
 surface of{weald clay, lower greensand
{gault clay}and{upper greensand.}      
      The North Downs are{chalk}hills  
 with a cap of{clay and flint}covered  
 with trees - mainly oak and beech.    
 Part of the woodland has been cleared 
 for grazing land.                     
      The steep scarp slope has thin   
 light grey soil and at the foot, on   
 the{upper greensand,}runs the Reading 
 Gatwick railway line which passes     
 through Dorking.
