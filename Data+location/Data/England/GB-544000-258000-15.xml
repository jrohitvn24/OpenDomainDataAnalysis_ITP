		<content> STRAWBERRY FAIR IS HELD ANNUALLY ON   
 MIDSUMMER COMMON.  THIS YEAR I HAD A  
 BOUNCE ON THE INFLATABLES AND CLIMBED 
 THE RIGGING OF THE PIRATE SHIP.  PAUL 
 SAW A PUPPET SHOW AND NATHAN SAW A    
 PUPPETEER WHO HAD PUPPETS FASTENED TO 
 HIS LEGS.  WHEN THE MAN JIGGED ABOUT, 
 THE PUPPETS DANCED.  THERE WAS A CLOWN
 DOING TRICKS AND WHEN HE ASKED THE    
 SPECTATORS TO JOIN IN, PAUL BLEW THE  
 TROMBONE.  A FIRE-EATER PUT A BURNING 
 TORCH INTO HIS MOUTH, THEN BLEW OUT   
 GREAT FLAMES.  A SWORD SWALLOWER WAS  
 BUSY EATING BLADES AND ALLEN WAS      
 WATCHING A JUGGLER TOSSING SKITTLES   
 INTO THE AIR.  SUSI HAD A RIDE ON A   
 DONKEY AND SEVERAL OF THE GIRLS SPENT 
 A LONG TIME LOOKING AROUND THE STALLS.
  THEY BOUGHT BRACELETS AND CLOTHES.   
 ELIZABETH HAD HER FACE PAINTED WITH A 
 RAINBOW AND CLOUDS.  THERE WAS PLENTY 
 OF FOOD AND DRINK TO BUY.             </content>
