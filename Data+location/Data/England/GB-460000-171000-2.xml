		<title>02FARMING - HOME FARM</title>
		<content> The land surrounding Englefield House 
 makes up the Home Farm. This is farmed
 by a family partnership. There is an  
 overall farm manager who is           
 responsible for the arable and the    
 livestock aspects of the farm. The    
 arable unit is staffed by a foreman   
 and four tractor drivers. The cropping
 includes winter wheat, winter barley  
 and winter oats as well as oil-seed   
 rape, peas, grass and sugar-beet for  
 seed. All these crops are combinable. 
 Maize, Lucerne and temporary and      
 permanent grass are grown for         
 conservation and grazing. They also   
 grow enough food for the livestock and
 supply them with straw. The livestoock
 unit includes 120 pedigree Guernseys  
 at Mayridge Farm and 150 Friesians at 
 Bournfield. It is staffed by a        
 dairyman, stockman and two other      
 workers.                              </content>
