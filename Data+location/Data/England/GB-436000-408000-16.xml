		<title>16SHAFTON VILLAGE &amp; SCHOOL</title>
		<content> Ours is a very old{village,}with many 
 old houses. The{Working Men's         
{Club}is next to our school; it used to
 be a farmhouse. It opens at 1900 and  
 closes at 2300; it has a dartboard and
 a pool room and you can buy drinks    
 like lager and beer. Our{school}was   
 built in 1911; a new hall was built in
 1968. In 1923 when children went      
 there from 5 to 14 there were {496    
{children}at the school but now there  
 are only{171; since 1968 it has been a
{First School.}We have a big field     
 where we have our sports and football 
 matches. Our Headteacher is Mr        
 Skipworth. Most of our dads work      
 for the NCB but the next highest      
 number of people are{unemployed;}my   
 dad says we will all be out of work if
{Mrs Thatcher}stays as{Prime Minister.
