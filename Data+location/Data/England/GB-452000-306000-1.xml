		<content> This area, 6 kilometres to the North  
 West of Leicester, contains the       
 residential districts of{Anstey,      
{Glenfield and Groby.}These are small  
 and busy villages with thriving       
 community life,varied small industries
 and pleasantly sited near to the city 
 and country.                          
 Between the villages is intensively   
 managed grass and rough grazing       
 land; the nature reserve at Groby     
 Pool; the administrative centre for   
 Leicestershire based at County Hall,  
 Glenfield; the Glenfield Hospital     
 complex and the start of several walks
 into the popular Charnwood district.  
 Access to the area is easy from the   
 motorway networks. The proposed       
 Leicester Western Bypass will improve 
 communications but will dissect the   
 fast growing villages of Groby and    
 Glenfield.                            </content>
