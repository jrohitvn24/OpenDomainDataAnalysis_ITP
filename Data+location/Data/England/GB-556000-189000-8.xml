		<content>   The{Warley Ridge}and the presence of
{woodlands}results in noticeable       
 variations in the local climate. It   
 invariably feels cooler on the top of 
 the Ridge because of the breezes which
 cause higher rates of evaporation     
 from the skin. In terms of actual     
 temperature, however, there are       
 measureable differences, particularly 
 on south-facing{slopes.}Measurements  
 were carried out in Great Warley in   
 June at various times of day, and it  
 was found that shade temperatures     
 varied by as much as 2.4 C on north-  
 facing slopes and 4.3 C on south-     
 facing slopes, within an altitudinal  
 range of 30 metres. Temperature       
 difference of up to 4 C were recorded 
 between the interior and exterior of  
{woods.}More commonly, however, the    
 differences were about 1 C.
