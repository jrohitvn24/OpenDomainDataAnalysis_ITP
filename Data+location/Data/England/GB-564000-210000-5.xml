   In this area houses are unevenly    
distributed, lying around the road     
network. Some parts have very few      
houses these being isolated farms.     
Many old houses have moats and large   
gardens e.g.Great Newarks. Most houses 
are old( i.e.fourteenth century        
designs),but a few have modern         
extension.Building materials include   
brick from the former local brick      
works, wood and tiles.                 
   Some houses have been divided into  
semi-detached, or converted into       
mansion style homes. Many houses are   
Tudor, Victorian, or Edwardian in age, 
some with unusual features e.g.Grays   
Farm has a horse hair ceiling.         
   The roofs are mainly thatch,tile,   
slate or made from galvanised iron.
