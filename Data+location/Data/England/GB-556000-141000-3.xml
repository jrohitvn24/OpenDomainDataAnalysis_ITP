		<content> The population of Southborough in 1981
was 10069, an increase of 314 on 1971. 
Of the 1981 population, 3082 lived in  
the west ward, a density of 49.71 per  
hectare; 3044 lived in the east ward   
where the density is 18.23 per hectare.
The north ward has a density of 8.23   
per hectare.                           
 Of the total population 53% were      
female. 22% were aged 0-15, reflecting 
falling school rolls. All these figures
came from the 1981 census abstracts.   
The data helped us to identify some of 
the major features of the area. There  
is only a small immigrant population of
4%. By checking with estate agents, we 
found that house prices were rising    
steadily. About 8% of the population   
moves each year. It was noted that only
5% of the population were unemployed   
and about 3.5% were students over      
sixteen.                               </content>
