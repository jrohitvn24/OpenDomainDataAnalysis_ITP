		<title>15THE GROWTH AREA OF WORTHING</title>
		<content> Durrington is a very recent area,     
 because there is the Fleetwning Estate
 which is only 15 years old.There are  
 quite a few shopping areas,such as    
 Tesco's supermarket which is very     
 popular.It is a very small place but  
 is still growing.There are the Nissan 
 Headquarters(car manufacturers)in West
 Durrington.Before,the Fleetwing Ewtate
 was a rubbish tip but was built over  
 in 1970.The school are for children   
 from 4-12 years.The library is small, 
 but adequate.There are bungalows,     
 semi-detatched houses,and detatched   
 houses.There is only one bank,and a   
 post office.By the supermarket there  
 are other shops.                      
 Altogether,I think that this area is  
 quite nice to live in.
