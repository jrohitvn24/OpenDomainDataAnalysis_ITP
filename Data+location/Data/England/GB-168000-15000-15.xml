		<content> I like living here because the beach  
 is down the road and when it is nice  
 I can just go for a swim.In the summer
 lots of holiday makers come down and  
 drive very fast on the roads and they 
 are very narrow with sharp corners.The
 beach at Cadgwith is small with quite 
 a lot of sand when the tide is        
 out.There is a big rock that people   
 sit on and jump off when the tide is  
 in.My dad is a fisherman and his boat 
 is at Cadgwith.He goes out most days  
 in the week.Sometimes he goes out     
 every day.When he goes early he goes  
 about 4.30 to 6.30a.m.In the summer I 
 go and do the store pots with him.We  
 go early and get back about 9p.m.His  
 boat is 25ft.It has a wheel house.    
 It has FH on its number which stands  
 for Falmouth Harbour.There are six or 
 seven boats from Falmouth and lots of 
 punts and smaller fishing boats.      </content>
