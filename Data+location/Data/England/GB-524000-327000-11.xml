        The inn was built approximately
 135 years ago and we believe that part
 of the premises was a brewery for many
 years.  During the Second World War,  
 members of the Home Guard were        
 stationed in an outbuilding to guard  
 the neighbouring bridge and river in  
 case of invasion.                     
      Today the "Mermaid" is an inn and
 we have several letting rooms and two 
 bars where we sell a selection of     
 beers and lagers.  Our beer comes     
 mainly from Nottingham and is         
 delivered by the kilderkin (18        
 gallons) or by barrel (36 gallons).   
 We also have a restaurant and diners  
 come for many a mile for one of our   
 'Mermaid' steaks.                     
      The licensee is Mr. Glen Miller.
