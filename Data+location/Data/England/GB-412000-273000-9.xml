		<title>09THE CANAL</title>
		<content> The canal near St.Patricks School is  
 part of the Stratford Upon Avon       
 Canal.It was built in 1793.In 1825 the
 Earlswood reservoirs were built to    
 give water to the canal and the       
 reservoir and the  canal were built   
 on fifty acres of common. For the     
 fifty acres they paid Â£969 to the     
 church wardens of Tanworth,who were   
 Thomas Burman and Insull Burman of    
 Hill Farm,Lady Lane. The money was to 
 be held in trust by the               
 church-wardens for the needs of the   
 parish.                               
 Today the canal is used carrying some 
 coal but mainly pleasure boats go     
 along it with holidaymakers.
