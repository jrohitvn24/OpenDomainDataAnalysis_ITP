		<title>17LUTON TOWN FOOTBALL CLUB</title>
		<content> "The Hatters" are in Division 1       
 of The Canon League and 1985 is their 
 centenary year.Former player David    
 Pleat has been manager for 7 years.   
                                       
 Their ground is in Bury Park,an older 
 residential district of S.E.Luton, and
 there is no room for expansion.A plan 
 to move to a specially built covered  
 stadium in Milton Keynes led to a     
 great deal of argument.Now the club   
 plan to replace their grass pitch with
 an artificial surface and seem certain
 to stay at Kenilworth Road.           
                                       
 Violence and vandalism by football    
 supporters have not passed Luton      
 by.In 1985 a match against Millwall   
 was held up when fans invaded the     
 pitch.Some people living near the     
 ground had their windows smashed.
