 Many people have expressed regret at  
 the{closure of railway lines}between  
 Bourne and surrounding towns such as  
 Sleaford,Boston and Grantham.Our      
 nearest mainline stations are now at  
 Peterborough and Grantham and require 
 a change of buses to reach them.{Bus  
{services,too,are greatly diminished   
 and leave non-car owners,particularly 
 the elderly and the young,somewhat    
 isolated.The number of{cars and       
{lorries}on the road has increased     
 accordingly and has largely           
 contributed to changing the peace and 
 tranquillity of village life but,at   
 the same time,enabling many to use    
 their leisure time visiting and       
 enjoying the surrounding amenities.   
{Cycling,}too,is still a fairly common 
 activity on our flat fenland roads.
