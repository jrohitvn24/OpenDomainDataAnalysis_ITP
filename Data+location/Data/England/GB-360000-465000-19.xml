		<title>19Organic Farming, Wray</title>
		<content> Mr Everett came to school to talk     
 about his organic farm at Backsbottom.
 On his farm, he does not use chemicals
 because the chemicals get into the    
 ground and into the streams, and can  
 kill insects, birds and animals.      
 Pesticides can get into food and you  
 eat them without knowing. Instead of  
 weed-killer, he uses a hoe. He grows  
 potatoes, peas, beans and all sorts   
 of vegetables, and uses manure to help
 them grow.                            
 Mr Everett plans to build a study     
 centre where people will be able to   
 learn about organic farming. The      
 centre will be solar heated, and      
 electricity will come from a windmill 
 and dam.                              
 Mr Everett spent three years setting  
 up his farm, and has actually been    
 farming for two years.
