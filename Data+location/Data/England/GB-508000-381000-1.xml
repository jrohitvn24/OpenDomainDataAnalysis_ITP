		<title>01THE HOLTON AREA- GENERAL</title>
		<content> This block hereafter referred to as   
 the Holton Area, comprises fairly     
 low lying land West of the            
 Lincolnshire Wolds and just south of  
 the small Market town of Market Rasen.
 It is predominantly an agricultural   
 area but has several businesses taking
 a low profile utilising open spaces   
 especially on the airfield.           
 There are 3 villages, Wickenby, Holton
 and Lissington. Holton is usually     
 referred to as Holton cum Beckering   
 but Beckering is just South of this   
 block. The villages follow the lines  
 of the roads and are small having     
 developed little over the years.      
 The inhabitants rely on Market Rasen, 
 Wragby and Lincoln for their          
 amenities. The decline in public      
 transport makes the area less         
 attractive to those unconnected with  
 agriculture or without cars.          </content>
