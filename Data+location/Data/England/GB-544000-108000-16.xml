		<title>16A FAMILY IN GLYNDE</title>
		<content> We visited a family with four sons to 
 find out about life for children in   
 Glynde. They have to go to school out 
 of the village as there is no school  
 in Glynde. They play cricket and swim 
 at the swimming pool and as there are 
 four of them they don't lack company. 
 Their house belongs to Glynde Estates.
 It is five hundred and two years old  
 and it is white weather boarded. It   
 used to be a butcher's and the nails  
 where the meat was hung are still     
 there. Their next door neighbour is an
 elderly person who keeps iguanas and  
 lizards as well as dogs and cats. She 
 tames robins too and she had two      
 two-headed lizards as well.           
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
