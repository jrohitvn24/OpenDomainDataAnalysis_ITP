		<title>06Up Bradley Church Tower</title>
		<content>On Thursday.July 13th,we went up the   
tower.The Vicar ,our teacher and Mr    
Holt,a church warden,came with us.The  
tower is 16th century on a 13th base.  
The doorway in the west wall was       
blocked using Norman stonework.We      
climbed the 59 steps up the spiral     
stone staircase to the top.It was very 
dark.Halfway up Mr Holt showed us how  
to wind the clock up.We went on up to  
the belfry and were shown the five old 
bells.Mr Holt made one of them         
ring.The belfry was used as a look out 
post during the last war.At the top of 
the 75ft tower we could see our modern 
Domesday area.We took two photographs. 
Mr Nutter from BBC Stoke came with us  
and asked us about our church.On       
Tuesday,July 16th,we listened to the   
radio and heard ourselves talking      
about the Domesday project.
