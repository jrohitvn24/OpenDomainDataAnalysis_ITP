		<content> Children from Langleybury visited the 
 site of the new roadworks and         
 discovered some very interesting      
 information. Work started on this     
 stretch in 1983 and it will not be    
 completed until 1988. most of the 70  
 men working for Fairclough and the 50 
 working for McAlpine come originally  
 from the north.Most workers work from 
 7am until 8pm daily. Heavy equipment  
 being used includes 7 dumper trucks,1 
 grader,1 ackerman,4x215 caterpillars  
 and all are working the whole time.   
 Other contractors deliver sand and    
 gravel in their own trucks.One country
 road_ Old House Lane _has had its     
 original route altered to line up with
 the site of a bridge over the new     
 road. It is felt by the children that 
 the road is progressing well and that 
 when complete it will help to relieve 
 many traffic problems around London.  </content>
