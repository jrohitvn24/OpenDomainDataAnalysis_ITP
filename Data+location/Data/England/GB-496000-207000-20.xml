Berkhamsted is a conventional English  
town in this respect. Some of the earl-
iest churches going back to Norman     
times and are built of local flint     
stone. There are four Anglican         
churches, one of which is combined     
with a Methodist church, two Baptist,  
one Roman Catholic, a Friends Meeting  
House, a Pentecostal Church and a      
Mormon Church. The Anglican churches   
cater for a wide range of spiritual    
appetites and practice, from the       
evangelical to the anglo-catholic      
stance. There are three voluntary aided
(church)schools in the town, two are   
first schools and the other is a middle
school. There is little evidence of    
other religious groups in the town,    
save for a few Sikh entrepreneurs who  
are invoved in newsagents and grocery  
retailing.                             </content>
