		<content>{INTRODUCTION TO DOWNDERRY/SEATON      
  The area described is  predominantly 
 agricultural,with a pair of small twin
 coastal villages.Curiously many of the
 facilities necessary to village life  
 are situated in a more southerly 'D   
 block' described elsewhere under the  
 Grid Ref. 02280051.                   
  The villages have developed since    
 1850 on the coastal fields of the many
 small farms.The catalyst to           
 development was the advent of Brunel's
 railway into Cornwall with the station
 at St.Germans,accessible by horse and 
 carriage.The later introduction of the
 motorcar allowed this area to become a
 seaside holiday venue,a retirement    
 centre and a dormitory site for the   
 connurbation of Plymouth and the towns
 of East Cornwall especially Torpoint  
 and Liskeard.
