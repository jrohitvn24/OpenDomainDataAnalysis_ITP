		<content>{Barrow Farm}is situated two kilometres
 East of Blackmore.It is a riding      
 centre for the{disabled}and it caters 
 for the{mentally}and{physically       
 handicapped.The riding centre was     
 opened in{1976}but they found that in 
 the winter the weather prevented full 
 use of the riding facilities.And so   
 they decided to build an indoor       
 school.They held{fund raising events  
 like coffee mornings,jumble sales and 
 sponsored walks.They raised           
 Â£100,000.The biggest event at{Barrow} 
{Farm}was when{Princess Ann}came to    
 open it on October 18th 1984.The      
 children come from{special schools}in 
 the area.The centre is very safety    
 conscious and when they get their next
 lot of money they are going to buy    
 some new hats.{Social Concern}is shown
 by local voluntary helpers who escort 
 and encourage the children.           </content>
