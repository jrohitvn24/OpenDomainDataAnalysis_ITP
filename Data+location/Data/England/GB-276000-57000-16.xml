		<title>16The Church of Harberton</title>
		<content> The Church is a large building        
 considering the size of the village.  
 The interior has been well maintained 
 with a very ornate rood screen and    
 pulpit.                               
 The Parish has recently celebrated its
 750th. anniversary. In the near future
 the parish will be amalgamated with   
 several adjacent churches. There is a 
 regular attendance of about 40 people 
 but more general support for church   
 organised events.                     
 The annual Harvest Festival is an     
 important village event much more     
 widely supported. A regular Sunday    
 school is attended by some 16         
 children. The church is the last      
 remaining focal point in the village.
