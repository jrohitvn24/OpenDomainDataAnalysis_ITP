		<title>14HIGH CROSS CHURCH TOWER.</title>
		<content> St. Johns' church did not have a tower
 until 1906. Today,the tower is the    
 main landmark of the village. From the
 outside,it looks just like a really   
 old Norman tower,so common in Herts.  
 The outside is clad with blocks of    
 weathered limestone,but on entering   
 the inside of the tower,the true age  
 is clearly seen,for it is of modern   
 brick construction. We were able to   
 climb to the top of the tower. The    
 floor above the vestry is reached by a
 narrow spiral staircase. On this floor
 is a large clock,made in Leeds and    
 built into the tower in 1906. It shows
 the time on the N. and W. sides. A    
 very steep and tall ladder took us to 
 the bell floor. There is only 1 small 
 bell here. Another ladder took us to  
 the top of the tower,where the view   
 was excellent. Climbing down the      
 ladders,was much worse than going up!.</content>
