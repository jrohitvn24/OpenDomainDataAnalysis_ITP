		<title>07PLACES TO PLAY</title>
		<content>  They're going to destroy our play    
 area.Near where I live there is an    
 old,unused coalmine.All it's waste    
 lies around it.My friends and I go    
 there nearly every night to play.The  
 biggest hill is bigger than a house   
 and is made up of clay,coal and stone.
 The council recently decided to turn  
 the area into an industrial site.We   
 will have nowhere to play when this is
 done,except the cricket field,but the 
 cricket team are always there and they
 send us off and tell us not to        
 trespass.My friend's mum has organised
 a petition but the council hasn't yet 
 replied.Now all our rope swings and   
 games of hide and seek will be        
 spoiled.Always adults get what they   
 want.It just doesn't seem fair to me.
