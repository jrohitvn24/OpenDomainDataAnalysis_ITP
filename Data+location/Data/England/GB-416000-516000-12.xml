		<title>12GAINFORD'S CUB PACK</title>
		<content>{                                      
{Being a Cub.}The cub leader is called 
{Akeala}and he runs the pack. In cubs  
 there are groups called green six, red
 six, and yellow six. The{sixes}have   
 different coloured woggles to         
 represent the colour of their six.    
 Every year there is a{job week}when   
 cubs and scouts go and earn money for 
 tents and other equipment, by doing   
 errands and jobs about the house.     
 There is a camp every year where they 
 play games, go hiking, sing songs and 
 make camp fires.{The cub uniform}is a 
 green jumper, grey shorts or trousers,
 a neckerchief and woggle. You can earn
 badges for running, swimming and other
 set tasks. Most boys enjoy going to   
 cubs and look forward to going up to  
 the{scout pack.
