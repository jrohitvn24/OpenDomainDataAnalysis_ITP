		<title>08A School dinner lady's hobby</title>
		<content> Mrs Read, our dinner lady, has        
 hundreds of plants. She showed us some
 cacti and one of them was hanging down
 over its flower pot. We were talking  
 to Mrs Read about how she looks after 
 all her plants and then we went down  
 into the school. We wrote about it in 
 our jotters. She gave us an African   
 Violet plant and a Strepocarpus plant 
 to keep in school. We put the plants  
 on the piano near the window. She gave
 each one of us a small cactus in a pot
 for us to take home.
