		<title>06 SUTTON MILL DAM FROM 1960</title>
		<content>     The water level in Sutton Mill Dam
 was gradually going down over the     
 years. The dirt and sand from the side
 of the dam had been washed down and   
 had settled on the bottom of the dam. 
 Eventually the dirt and sand grew     
 further until there was hardly any    
 water left.                           
     In the early 1960's this was made 
 worse by subsidence at the head of    
 Sutton Mill Dam.  This meant that the 
 dams held even less water.            
     By the time British Sidac closed  
 down in 1982 the series of dams were  
 used only as reserves for washing and 
 fire-fighting.  The main water supply 
 for the production process was piped  
 underground from Carr Mill Dam.
