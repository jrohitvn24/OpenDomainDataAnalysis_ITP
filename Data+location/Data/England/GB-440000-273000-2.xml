		<title>02THE VILLAGE OF WOLSTON</title>
		<content> Wolston is a very pretty village, with
 a stream running through into the     
 River Avon, crossed by many bridges,  
 with a mixture of old and new houses. 
 There is a{population}of 2,200+, the  
 majority of the inhabitants commuting 
 to Coventry or Rugby. The village is  
 concentrated mainly in one kilometre  
 square surrounded by open fields and  
 farmland. The{village green}is the    
 scene of Morris dancing and the site  
 of the War Memorial, where the Service
 of Remembrance is held each year. The 
 most{historic house}in Wolston is The 
 Priory now belonging to the village   
 doctor, but which was once the site of
 St. Peter's Benedictine Abbey C1090,  
 (said originally to be connected by a 
 secret passage to{St. Margaret's      
{Church)}and where, in the 16th        
 century, the Marprelate Tracts were   
 illegally printed.                    </content>
