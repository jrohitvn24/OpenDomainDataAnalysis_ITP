		<title>06WOODBURY HILL</title>
		<content> Woodbury Hill was the site of a       
{fortified camp}as long ago as the     
 Bronze Age. It was probably used      
 by the{Celts}under Caractacus and     
 later by the{Romans.}In succeeding    
 centuries it was used by Saxons,Danes 
 and Normans. In{1405 Owen Glendower   
 led an army of Welsh and French forces
 against{Henry IV.}He marched on       
 Worcester and after pillaging and     
 burning the city he camped on Woodbury
 Hill.Advance guards of Henry IV had   
 camped on Abberley Hill and controlled
 supply lines. For eight days the      
 opposing armies engaged in skirmishes 
 and jousting contests below the hills 
 in Witley.Eventually Henry withdrew to
 Worcester and the Welsh and French    
 forces retreated to Wales.Woodbury    
 Hill Fort was again occupied in{1483  
 by the Duke of Buckingham in the reign
 of Richard III.                       </content>
