		<title>05HAREWOOD HOUSE:BIRD GARDEN</title>
		<content>   The Bird Garden is the most popular 
 attraction of the Harewood grounds.It 
 began in 1968 after a visit to        
 Bourton-on-Water where there is       
 another Garden.It was opened on March 
 31st 1970 after Lord and Lady Harewood
 thought of the idea.                  
   It has an area of four and a half   
 acres with 170 species of birds.Since 
 it opened, it has acquired several    
 mammals,reptiles and amphibians.There 
 are 4 staff and a curator.Birds come  
 from all countries,but common birds   
 have now been phased out.             
   The emphasis is on breeding         
 endangered species,so 95% of all their
 birds are captive bred.There are      
 special diets for all birds which help
 them to grow and breed.Vets are on    
 call 24 hours a day and visit once a  
 month.
