 convenient shop in Weston.The shop    
 sells a number of tinned foods,       
 cheeses,crisps and sweets.The owners  
 of the shop are very friendly to all  
 their customers and know most of them 
 very well.The shop has recently had a 
 post-office area added where many     
 people receive their Family Allowances
 and Pensions which which are sums of  
 money from Govenment to provide for   
 their family and their old age.The    
 owners of the shop also live in the   
 house adjacent to the shop.The shop   
 is a self-service shop which means    
 people can help them selves at their  
 own pace from the shelves and take    
 them to the counter to pay.
