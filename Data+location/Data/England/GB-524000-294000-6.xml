		<title>06The Vicar of Whittlesey 2</title>
		<content>     The property that the church owns 
 in the parish now is the two churches,
 two halls one for each church, a house
 that the curate lives in and vicarage.
     Compared with a hundred years ago 
 the land owned by the church is fairly
 small because then the vicar was paid 
 from the rent of the land locally     
 owned, but now most of that land has  
 either been sold, or is being managed 
 by central government.                
     I think people reading this in a  
 hundred years will want to know that  
 nowadays people go to church if they  
 want to, in the olden days people went
 to church because they had to. Now it 
 is getting back to the way Jesus said 
 it was to be, where people were free  
 to choose which path they wished to   
 follow, they would only come to him if
 they wanted to. I think the church in 
 Whittlesey will survive a long time.  </content>
