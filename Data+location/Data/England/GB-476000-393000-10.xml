		<title>10The Landscape of the area</title>
		<content> Much of the land is flat and low lying
 on the flood plain of the River Trent.
 Over the years much effort has gone   
 into confining the River Trent to its 
 own course but there are still        
 occasional floods and it is because of
 these periodic inundations over       
 hundreds of years that the area is so 
 richly fertile and therefore largely  
 given over to arable use.             
 Water is an important feature with the
 Rivers Trent and Idle,the Chesterfield
 Canal and large drains(dykes) many of 
 which were built by Vermuyden in the  
 early 17th Century when large areas   
 were drained.                         
{River Trent:}This part is tidal and   
 navigable;a feature is the Eagre which
 is a tidal wave created in certain    
 circumstances when the tide and the   
 current meet(similar to the Severn    
 Bore).                                </content>
