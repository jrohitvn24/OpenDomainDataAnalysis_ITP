		<content>   Red, fallow and muntjac deer are    
 found in the woodlands. Periodically  
 the Bourne and Pillow (Pillar) Woods  
 are closed to the general public for  
 the necessary culling of the deer.    
   Grass snakes, long tailed voles,    
 stoats and weasels abound in the      
 woods.                                
   A variety of game breeds in the     
 district including rabbits, hares,    
 pheasant and partridge; but the       
 partridge this year are scarce because
 of the wet weather during the breeding
 season. There are numerous grey       
 squirrel, foxes and one or two badger 
 sets. This year, thirteen fox cubs    
 were found in some bales of hay on one
 farm, possibly from two litters.
