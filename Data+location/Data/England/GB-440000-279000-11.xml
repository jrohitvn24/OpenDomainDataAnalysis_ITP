		<title>11Changes in Brinklow</title>
		<content> Mr. Poxon,a tenant farmer at          
 Brierley's farm and also Chairman of  
 the Parish Council,has seen some      
 changes that he has liked and some he 
 dislikes during the 25 years he has   
 lived in Brinklow.At one time there   
 were several smaller farms in the area
 but these have amalgamated to form the
 larger farming units that he          
 prefers.At one time farmers were able 
 to drive the cattle along the main    
 road but because of the increase in   
 traffic they now have to transport    
 them by lorry to wherever they want to
 take them.Mr. Poxon thinks that the   
 busy main road now causes lots of     
 problems for people trying to cross   
 it.He says that Brinklow is a village 
 community and he hopes that it can be 
 kept that way.
