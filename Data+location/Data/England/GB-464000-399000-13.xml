		<content> Housing:                              
   Only a small number of the buildings
 in Finningley village today were built
 before the 20th century.Many were farm
 buildings.Most of them have been      
 converted into residential properties.
   Building just before and after the  
 2nd World War almost doubled the size 
 of the village, and its character was 
 changed,from being a rural community, 
 where just about everybody worked on  
 the land, to being a place where      
 people lived whilst working in the    
 surrounding towns and villages.       
   During the last 15 years the village
 has again doubled in size, with the   
 building of many small estates of     
 houses,three of which are currently   
 being further developed.              
 Other services:                       
 Several shops: a grocers,a newsagent &amp;
 a garage.A riding school is also here.</content>
