		<content> David Lewis's mother used to work as a
 an{aerobics}teacher for an            
 organisation called 'Fitness', though 
 she now works for herself. She finds  
 that people want to exercise much more
 than they used to and whereas boys    
 have always had an advantage with gym 
 clubs and cricket and football clubs, 
 more girls and women are now able to  
 exercise through aerobics and dance.  
 She says that people want to exercise 
 for the following reasons: for        
 pleasure, as a competetive sport, to  
 help maintain an ideal body weight, to
 relieve stress, to improve body shape 
 and as a social pastime.              
 She says that most people feel being  
 slimmer not only makes them feel more 
 attractive but helps them to cope     
 better with life's stresses.
