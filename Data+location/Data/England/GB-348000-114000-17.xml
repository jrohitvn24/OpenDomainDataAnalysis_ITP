		<title>17THE VILLAGE HALL</title>
		<content> We have a Village Hall Committee.     
 The committee runs the hall.They      
 have a meeting  every month to see    
 what to do. Mrs Rodber collects the   
 money to borrow the hall.What you     
 pay depends on who you are borrowing  
 the hall. If you live in the village  
 it doesn't cost so much as it does    
 outsiders to the village. There are   
 20 _30 people in the committee. The   
 village hall was built in 1971. They  
 have many clubs every  week :         
 Mon _ Cubs and Guides                 
 Tues _Youth club                      
 Wed _ Clean up                        
 Thurs _ Brownies                      
 Fri _ School drama.                   
 These are only a sample of the        
 activities. The hall stands in its own
 recreation ground with room for       
 football pitch, car park and play     
 area.                                 </content>
