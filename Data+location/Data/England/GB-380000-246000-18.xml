		<content>{The Garage}.The majority of houses    
 have a garage. This can be joined on  
 to the side of the house,in which case
 there may be access directly from the 
 house,as well as from the main doors, 
 or it may be set away from the        
 house.The main function of the garage 
 is to house motor vehicles, to protect
 them from extreme weather conditions, 
 which can adversely affect their      
 running,and also to protect them from 
 intruders.However, it is also         
 frequently used to store bicycles,lawn
 mowers, garden tools,( such as        
 spades,forks,rakes,hoes and shears ), 
 and tools for carpentry and home      
 making.It can also be used as a       
 workshed for carpenting, metal work,  
 and repairing motor vehicles. Work    
 benches may be installed for this     
 purpose.
