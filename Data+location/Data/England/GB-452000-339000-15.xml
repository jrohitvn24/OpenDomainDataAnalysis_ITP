 producer and exporter of bicycles and 
 wheeled toys. Raleigh has 90 years of 
 history. It was founded in a small    
 workshop with 12 men producing 3      
 cycles per week. Now they turn out 1  
 cycle every 12 seconds.{Frank Bowden,

 to build cycles in the mid 1800's. In 
 1888 he bought a small company in     
 Raleigh Street and in 1896 the largest

 workers, was built on a 7.5 acre site 
 on{Faraday Road, Radford.}In 1902     
 Raleigh took over the{Sturmey Archer} 
 company to make gears. By 1914 they   
 were making 50,000 cycles/year.
