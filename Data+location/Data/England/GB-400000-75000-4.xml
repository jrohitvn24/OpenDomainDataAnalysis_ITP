		<content>      The whole centre is quiet, calm, 
 inviting, and very informative, for   
 whatever age group make a visit. At   
 the Purbeck Marble counter you can    
 purchase maps and guides.             
      While surveying we noted cars    
 from many parts of the world. The age 
 group of visitors varied from toddlers
 to the retired. Facilities are good   
 for the disabled.                     
      Parking for one hundred and fifty
 vehicles is available. Within this    
 area there is room for picnics and    
 recreation, while remaining an        
 interesting habitat.                  
      All around the cleverly designed 
 car parks attention to detail is      
 made;tree planting and care of plants 
 amongst them.
