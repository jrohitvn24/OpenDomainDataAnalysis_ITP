		<title>06THE PROPOSED BY_PASS</title>
		<content> The Proposed By_pass.                 
      Three routes have been proposed  
 for the bypass. In all three cases    
 they are about five km long and will  
 cost approxmately five million pounds.
      The main problem with the by pass
 is the route that it will take. While 
 all agree that it is needed no body   
 wants it to go past their house.      
     Another problem with the route is 
 will it remove the Chard traffic as   
 well as the A35 traffic ? To do this  
 only one route is possible and that is
 from the Yarty bridge to Millbrook and
 then across Sector lane to Raymonds   
 hill.                                 
      As yet no firm route has been    
 choosen and what ever the final route 
 it will not please everybody.
