		<content>  Tourism is very important in Port    
 Isaac.There are many gift shops,cafes 
 and restaurants,holiday cottages and  
 guest houses.People come for the sea  
 and the beautiful countryside.All of  
 the people apart from the ones who    
 live abroad who we interveiwed came   
 by car.Mostly they were staying nearby
 in caravans,with friends or in self   
 catering accommodation.The length of  
 most peoples holidays was 1-3 weeks.  
 All of them apart from 2 had stayed in
 Cornwall before and they realy liked  
 their holiday even though the weather 
 had not been very nice. The things    
 that people like doing on holiday are 
 walking and swimming and the things   
 that people would llke improved are   
 the roads. Several people said that   
 they would like better car parking    
 facilities and less traffic in the    
 villages.                             </content>
