		<content>    We are in the sixth form at Swinton
 Comprehensive School. We have a wide  
 choice of subjects here such as       
 physics and maths to english and art. 
 As well as lessons we have            
 approximately four hours of private   
 study in which to do homework and     
 preparation for lessons. In between   
 lessons there is a fifteen minute     
 break and an hour for lunch. The      
 school day lasts about six and a half 
 hours. The sixth form also holds many 
 social events throughout the year in  
 the form of social evenings and       
 parties. There are also many clubs    
 within the school such as sports clubs
 and a computer club.
