		<content> Fox's Dairy is a distribution depot.  
 The bottling takes place at Northern  
 Dairies in Middlesbrough. The Dairy is
 a family business having been started 
 by Mr Fox's grandfather.              
                                       
 The first floats leave at 4.30am and  
 return at 10am. As well as selling    
 milk they also sell other dairy       
 products such as eggs, butter, cream  
 and yoghurt. They also carry small    
 amounts of potatoes and bread, earning
 the milkmen commission.               
                                       
 The average amount of milk carried    
 each day is 9,700 pints of pastuerised
 milk and 2,700 pints of semi-skilled  
 milk. They also deliver 1,300 cartons 
 of milk to the shops. The milk floats 
 are electric so they have to be       
 recharged every day. They can travel  
 40 miles on a full charge.            </content>
