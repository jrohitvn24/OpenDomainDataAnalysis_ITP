		<title>04SHOPPING IN AYLMERTON</title>
		<content>   In Aylmerton there are two shops, a 
 Post Office and a grocer's.  There is 
 a fishmonger's van and a chip van     
 that come through the village         
 regularly.  Outside the village, the  
 nearest shops are in Cromer or West   
 Runton.                               
  The grocer's shop is next to the     
 petrol station.  It is small but      
 efficient, selling sweets, post cards,
 groceries, cigarettes and other every_
 day items.                            
  The busiest time of the year is      
 summer, when the tourists buy things. 
 Most of their custom, however, comes  
 from local people who buy mainly      
 sweets, cigarettes, ice_creams and    
 groceries.                            
  The fishmonger's van comes round once
 every week selling fresh fish.        
  The Post Office opens every day      
 except Sundays.                       </content>
