		<title>17St. Hilary's Tower.</title>
		<content> For miles around the tower can be seen
 standing alone on the hilltop near to 
 the church of St. Hilary. its         
 neglected and blackened sandstone     
 shell has become the home of wild     
 pigeons who fly in and out            
 undisturbed.                          
 Around the tower are old gravestones, 
 many with little left of their message
 to read as they have worn away with   
 wind and rain.A small plaque above the
 doorway shows the date to be 1530     
 which makes it the oldest building in 
 Wallasey.                             
 The church itself was burnt down for  
 the second time in 1857 when it was   
 decided to leave the tower and rebuild
 the church on a new site nearby.      
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
