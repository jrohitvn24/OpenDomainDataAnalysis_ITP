		<title>01Ringland - East to Taverham</title>
		<content>      There are two villages linked by 
 the meandering River Wensum.{Ringland 
 still has several old village families
 and is a small village in a rural area
 of agricultural and wooded land.      
      Western{Taverham}incorporates    
 most of the oldest &amp; some of the newer
 housing. It is now a large residential
 village, popular because of facilities
 and proximity to{Norwich.}1981 census 
 population{Ringland 170,Taverham 4314.
      Both villages are without street 
 lighting and{Ringland's}unpaved roads 
 are unfenced secondary. The A1067     
{Norwich to Fakenham}road runs along   
{Taverham's}northern border.           
      There are very sparse shopping,  
 health or education amenities now     
 actually in{Ringland}but Taverham has 
 the whole range of these facilities   
 and a health centre all available for 
{Ringland}people to use. (Mrs.S.Solly) </content>
