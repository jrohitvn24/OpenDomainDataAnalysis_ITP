		<content> IN 1983 THE MINISTRY OF DEFENCE LEASED
 11 ACRES OF LAND ADJOINING RAF HIGH   
 WYCOMBE FROM THE NATIONAL TRUST       
 BRADENHAM ESTATE. IT WAS FOR THE      
 CONSTRUCTION OF AN{UNDERGROUND        
{COMMUNICATIONS CENTRE}TO REPLACE THE  
 OUTDATED SYSTEM AT PRESENT IN USE IN  
 STRIKE COMMAND H.Q.. THERE WAS AN     
 OUTCRY FROM MANY MEMBERS OF BOTH THE  
 NATIONAL TRUST AND THE CAMPAIGN FOR   
 NUCLEAR DISARMAMENT WHO DISAPPROVED OF
 THE USE TO WHICH THE CENTRE WOULD BE  
 PUT IN A NUCLEAR WAR. DESPITE THE FUSS
 CONSTRUCTION HAS GONE AHEAD AND THE   
{"BUNKER"}WILL BE COMPLETED IN 1986. IT
 IS NOT A BOLT HOLE FOR THE AIR        
 MARSHALS IN TIME OF WAR AND WE ARE    
 ASSURED THAT IT IS PURE COINCIDENCE   
 THAT A RESERVOIR IS BEING BUILT RIGHT 
 NEXT TO IT.
