		<title>15Freddie Festival Mascot</title>
		<content>   A famous local personality was born 
in Dilhorne not long ago. He is Freddie
who rose to stardom when he was        
featured in the children's book:       
    "FREDDIE and the STAR of AFRICA"   
Freddie was created by husband and wife
Francis and Shelia Wainwright for their
daughter Victoria who attends Dilhorne 
School.The children were fascinated to 
hear how a book is written and produced
and even more astonished to find  out  
that Freddie had been chosen as the    
mascot for Stoke on Trent's National   
Garden Festival to be held in 1986.    
   The Festival is to be held on the   
old Shelton Iron &amp; Steel Works grounds 
and it is hoped it will be as succesful
as that of the Liverpool Festival held 
in 1984.Many new jobs have been created
and Freddie has had a new adventurte in
"Freddie and the Bank of England       
Mystery".                              </content>
