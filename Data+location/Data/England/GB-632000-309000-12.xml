		<title>12LIFE OF A COMMUTER</title>
		<content>   Many people who live in Blofield,   
 Blofield Heath and the surrounding    
 villages commute daily to work in     
 Norwich.                              
  We live in Blofield and my father    
 works at the Norfolk and Norwich      
 Hospital and twice a week he works at 
 the West Norwich Hospital.            
   He gets up at 7.15 approx. has      
 breakfast at about 7.30, where he     
 reads the paper to catch up with the  
 days events.  Then at 8.00 he leaves  
 for work.  He takes an average of     
 twenty minutes to drive the 8 miles to
 the hospital.  But sometimes it is    
 longer because the roads are busier.  
   He returns home at about 7.00, after
 a long days work, but sometimes he is 
 later because he has to go to meetings
 and hold lectures.
