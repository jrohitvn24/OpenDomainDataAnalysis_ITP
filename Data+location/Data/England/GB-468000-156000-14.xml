		<content>{Thursdays.}                           
 Thursday mornings I get out of bed and
 have breakfast. For my breakfast I    
 have Rice Crispies and afterwards I   
 have to put my plate on the sink ready
 for washing up.                       
 I then go and get my clothes out if   
 the airing cupboard and get dressed. I
 clean my teeth with Crest toothpaste  
 and my tooth brush is blue. I do my   
 hair while my mum is putting on her   
 make up.I then have to have my        
 medecine because I have Asthma.       
 After that I get my shoes on , they   
 are black, and then I go to school.   
 After play we come into the school and
 have the register and assembly. We do 
 some language work in our first "home 
 base." My favourite jobs are maths and
 language.
