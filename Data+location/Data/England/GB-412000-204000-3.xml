		<content>{Quenington}is an old village on the   
 edge of the Cotswolds,it has almost   
 five hundred inhabitants.The original 
 village lies on the banks of the River
 Coln.                                 
    The houses built since 1850 have   
 been built away from the river. The   
 reason for this move to higher ground 
 is that during the winter the river   
 floods.An unexpected bonus of this    
 flooding is that it provides the      
 children with a natural skating       
 rink.                                 
   At the centre of the village is     
 Quenington Court, an old Crusaders    
 Commandery,two mills dating back to   
 Saxon times and a Saxon Church.
