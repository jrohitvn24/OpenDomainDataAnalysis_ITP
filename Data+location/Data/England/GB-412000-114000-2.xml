		<content>   {The River Avon}is quite deep.      
 However, the weed interferes with the 
 flow of the river. People cut the     
 weed - the cutting starts in April.   
 In the old days, knives were used to  
 cut the weed which sometimes grew to  
 a length of three or four feet. The   
 longest recorded length of weed in the
 Avon is twenty-five feet. Nowadays,   
 the cutting service uses boats with   
 weed or grass cutters on them. This   
 new service started round about 1940. 
 When the weed has been cut, a weed    
 boom is laid across the river. A weed 
 boom is a rake which catches the weed 
 as the river flows.                   
    All the land on both sides of the  
 river is private, apart from the      
 stretch at the recreation ground in   
 Fordingbridge.
