		<content>    The indigenous families are in the 
 main connected with the farms or with 
 occupations depending upon farming. In
 recent years purely farmworkers have  
 reduced drastically in number with the
 introduction of modern farming        
 techniques and machines, but being of 
 a resourceful and practical nature    
 people have been able to adapt to     
 these new activities. Many of the     
 younger generation have set up small  
 buisnesses connected with land use or 
 general building activities.. The     
 nearby small town of Bridport offers  
 work in the old established netting   
 and rope industry and in holiday      
 catering and services generally. The  
 well known Moores Biscuit factory     
 employs a small number of workers.
