		<content> With a population of over{500 people  
 roughly a quarter of these are        
 children so with no school in the area
 they are transported by school buses  
 to nearby areas.Most families own at  
 least one car,and many generously     
 offer lifts to non_drivers.Buses are  
 infrequent,twice every week to Swindon
 and Cirencester.Postal vans deliver   
 mail once &amp;collect twice a day.With no
 surgery in the area people rely on the
 Malmesbury doctors and district nurses
 for home visits and are transported to
{Malmesbury District Hospital}for      
 physiotherapy and specialist          
 clinics.This hospital has been kept   
 open,and much of its equipment bought 
 by the{Hospital League of Friends.}   
 This is a close_knit community.{
