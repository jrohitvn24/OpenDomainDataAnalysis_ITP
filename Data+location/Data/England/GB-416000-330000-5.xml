 owned by Mr. Hitchmough.  It was

 company was formed to manufacture     
 excavator buckets.

 worked there since 1974.  He has got  
 eleven people working there. One of   
 them is his wife, Mrs. Walker.  She   
 works in the office with Mrs. Harris, 
 while Mr. Walker works in the shop.   
 One of the workers, Mr. Baldy comes on

 mess that has been made. The buildings
 used to be a farm until they were     
 taken over.
