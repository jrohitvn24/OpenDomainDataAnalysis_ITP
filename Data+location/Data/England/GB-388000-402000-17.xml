		<content>   Sometimes the tradesman still comes 
 to us rather than us going to him. The
 milkman is still the most common      
 visitor of this kind. We can also     
 see the ice-cream van in the street   
 and the occasional mobile shop usually
 selling greengroceries. The rag and   
 bone man still shouts out his cries   
 while the ice-cream van uses its      
 mechanical chimes to tell us it has   
 arrived in the street. We can also see
 the window cleaner selling his        
 services for money. We see people     
 delivering what we have already bought
 from a shop, such as our newspapers   
 delivered daily.
