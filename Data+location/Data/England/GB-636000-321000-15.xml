		<title>15SUTTON CHURCH</title>
		<content> There are two places of worship in    
 Sutton, a Methodist Chapel and the    
 Parish Church. The church dates back  
 to medieval times. There have been    
 several additions to the structure    
 since and much restoration work has   
 been carried out, one major item being
 the restoration of the roof in 1974.  
 The church has a 60 foot flint tower  
 and a peal of 3 bells. Work presently 
 being carried out involves the        
 overhaul of the organ and its removal 
 to another part of the church. The    
 Lady Chapel is also being rebuilt. An 
 interesting feature of the pews is    
 that all the carved heads on them are 
 slightly different.
