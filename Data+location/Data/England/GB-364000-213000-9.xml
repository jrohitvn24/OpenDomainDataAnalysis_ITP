		<content> My favourite game is Tag. You have    
 some friends and you say what is      
 Denno. This means a safe place, like a
 wall or a tree. You say what is Denno 
 and someone is on it. They have to    
 chase you and touch you and sometimes 
 you get the person and tag them then  
 they have to be the chaser.If they are
 on Denno they are safe and if they get
 off you can tag them. It is a good    
 game. It makes you nice and warm.     
                                       
 My favourite game is Pass the         
 Parcel. You have a parcel and you sit 
 in a circle and you pass the parcel to
 the person sitting next to you and    
 when the music stops the person who   
 has got it has to take a layer of     
 paper off, until all the paper is off 
 and the person who's got the last     
 paper off wins what is inside.
