		<title>11DAY OF BOY IN  N.BRISTOL</title>
		<content> I rose at 9.00 pm on Saturday.I put my
 blue pants,white socks,breakdance tee-
 shirt,jeans,olympus top &amp; boots with  
 very thick red laces on.I went down   
 stairs &amp; had a bowl of Frosties &amp; some
 toast for breakfast.I went outside to 
 fetch my bike from the garage &amp; called
 for Alexander.We got his lilo out &amp; my
 portable stereo &amp; my electro 6 tape &amp; 
 went round the flats to watch Alex    
 breakdance until 10.15am.Then we took 
 all the stuff back to my house &amp; got  
 the cricket set out &amp; had a game of   
 cricket in the street. It got a bit   
 boring so we got our bikes out &amp; went 
 down the park &amp; rode about &amp; pulled   
 wheelies.I went back to my house to   
 have dinner.I had pizza &amp; chips.I     
 called for Simon &amp; we went over the   
 golf course looking for golf balls.For
 tea I had crisps &amp; ham sandwiches.I   
 watched T.V.for the rest of the day.  </content>
