		<content>   Sproutes dairy farm (250 acres) has 
 160 milkers, bull beef and followers, 
 7 sows, 100 turkeys, geese, ducks,    
 chickens, pheasants, a game licence   
 for venison, and a small Farm Shop.   
 The farmer is leaning towards organic 
 farming. He is experimenting with     
 growing certain herbs for hay in a    
 l5-acre meadow (less productive than  
 3 cuts a year from Italian rye grass),
 and has cleared a pine plantation and 
 planted oaks and deciduous woodland.  
 His fields are too large, so he is    
 planting mixed hedges of maple, holly,
 blackthorn, hawthorn and oaks. He and 
 his wife are keen hunting people.     
       (Several farmers are interested 
 in the future use of lupins as a crop;
 these would not need spraying when in 
 full flower, unlike rape. Also there  
 are new varieties of rape being grown 
 which should give fewer problems.)    </content>
