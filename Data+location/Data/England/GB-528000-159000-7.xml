		<title>07Small Shops in Purley</title>
		<content>   Around Purley there are many small  
 parades of shops offering a valuable  
 service to the old, handicapped and   
 those without transport.              
   The shops come in handy if anyone   
 forgets something. A high majority    
 think prices are too high for them so 
 leave their shopping for the larger   
 shops. The small shops are valuable   
 for community life-meeting chatting   
 and often having a drink together, but
 mainly for O.A.P's. Most parades      
 contain a newsagents and often an off 
 licence or general store.             
   We agree that these shops are in a  
 good position and most have adequate  
 parking space. In our small survey 44%
 would shop locally more often if there
 were more bigger shops and 60% use    
 take-away shops more than once a      
 fortnight. Small shops are often run  
 by people from India and Pakistan.    </content>
