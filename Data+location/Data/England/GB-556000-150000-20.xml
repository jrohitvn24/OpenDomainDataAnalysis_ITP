		<title>20The Deer.</title>
		<content> We were whisking to school by car when
 we came to the crossroads. We went a  
 little way past a tiny field which    
 belongs to Dene College.Suddenly there
 was a stir in the long grass, up came 
 a fawny head with brown,dark, sad and 
 solemn eyes, his face looked as though
 it was made of velvet.It was a deer.  
   We felt so excited, it is not every 
 day you see a deer, it is an unusual  
 sight but we did not see it for long  
 because it ran into the woods.        
  We were told that the mother deer is 
 dead she was run over when taking it  
 across the road so it is an orphan.   
  So we must drive carefully.
