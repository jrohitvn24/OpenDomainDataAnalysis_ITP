		<content> One dual carriageway,the A23;one main 
 road;two secondary roads and a number 
 of smaller roads cross the area.      
  Generally the roads are well kept    
 especially the A23 which is the main  
 London_Brighton route.This is the     
 busiest road with cars making up 57%  
 of the vehicles surveyed.These were   
 evenly split between British &amp;        
 Foreign. Lorries made up 23%,vans     
 15%,buses/coaches 3%,&amp; motorbikes 2%. 
 Over six hundred vehicles were counted
 during a one hour period on a weekday 
 Surveys on the smaller roads showed   
 light use mostly by cars.             
  There are two local buses offering a 
 2 hourly service.                     
  The majority of households have one  
 or more cars,most with petrol engines.
 There are few motorbikes &amp; bicyles.As 
 this is a farming area quite a few    
 farm vehicles were seen.              </content>
