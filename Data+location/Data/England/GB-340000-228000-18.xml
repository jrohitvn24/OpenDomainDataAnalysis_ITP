 Using bicycles for stunts has become  
 popular in the last decade, because   
 heavy traffic has made the roads      
 dangerous for children. The bicycles  
 are made of strong yet light materials
 (metal and plastic) ad have good      
 brakes and tyres and special pedals.  
 Here are some of the stunts you can   
 do:{"Wheelies"}is when you balance on 
 the back wheel and{"bunny hops"}are   
 when you balance on the front wheel. A
{"pancake"}is when you go up a ramp and
 in the air you turn and land back on  
 your wheels. You can stand on the seat
 and also on the crossbar and let go of
 the handlebars. You have to wear a    
 special helmet and kneepads so that   
 you do not hurt yourself badly.
