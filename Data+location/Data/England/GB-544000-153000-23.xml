<title>23Westerham's Farmers' Market</title>
<content>

Westerham's Farmers' Market opened in May 2010.  Markets are held in Market Square (outside The George and Dragon pub) on the first and third Sunday of each month, from 9.30 to 12.30. &lt;br />&lt;br />There are delicious breads, cheeses, vegetables, fish, olives, plants, wines, honey, cakes, nuts and preserves. There are also some unusual craft stalls. &lt;br />&lt;br />The organisers try to invite stallholders whose produce is as local as possible and doesn't compete with existing businesses in town. Shopping in a market always seems more fun and there's always a chance to catch up on local gossip with old friends and meet new neighbours. You can always stop to buy a bacon roll from Peter, Kate and Dan and help to raise money for the Sea Cadets and other local charities. &lt;br />&lt;br />Westerham was given its first market charter in 1227 and has been a Market Town ever since.   &lt;br />
