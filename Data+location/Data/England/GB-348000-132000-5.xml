		<content> There are many activities available to
 the people of Compton Dundon and the  
 surrounding area.There is a well run  
{Woman's Institute}and an active{parish
{council}.The village has both a{darts 
 and a{skittles}team as well as a tug  
{of war team}.The activities are so    
  varied because the age-groups are    
 evenly spread.The main areas of       
 employment are farming and office-jobs
 in nearby towns.The latter involve    
 commuting.Although the community      
 spirit is good there are no street    
 parties or any other forms of         
 celebration on special occasions.One  
 of the most noticeable changes in the 
 area is the {heavy increase in        
{traffic.}This, with the bad drainage  
 are the main criticism of the people. 
 Apart from these problems it is agreed
 that Compton Dundon is a pleasant     
 place to live.                       {</content>
