		<title>10FARMING OWERSBY POULTRY</title>
		<content> Since the 1950's egg production has   
 become intensive and moved indoors. It
 is practised on one farm in this area 
 being associated with a cereal growing
 enterprise to provide a large proport-
 ion of the poultry food.Manure from   
 the birds is used to fertilize grass- 
 land on the same holding.The laying   
 hens are housed in an environment     
 where light and temperature are con-  
 trolled to give an even production of 
 eggs throughout the year.The 21'c.temp
 enables efficient egg production with 
 economical food  consumption.Day old  
 chicks are housed on peat moss under  
 gas heaters,the heat being reduced    
 over 2-3 weeks until they can manage  
 to generate enough for themselves.At  
 18 weeks of age they are housed in    
 cages for the duration of a laying    
 period of approximately 13 months.
