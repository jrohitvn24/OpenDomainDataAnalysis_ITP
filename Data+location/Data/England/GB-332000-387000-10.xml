		<content> 1In 1981 Toxteth, which comprises much
 of our 12 sq. km. block was the scene 
 of the{worst mainland rioting in the  
{history of Great Britain.}As a prelude
 to the Toxteth Riots there had been   
 unrest in other areas with large      
 racial minorities notably in{Brixton  
{in London and St. Paul's in Bristol.  
 The attempted arrest by police of some
 black men in the Liverpool 8 area     
 started a series of night time riots  
 involving{stone throwing mobs}of      
 predominantly white youths faced by   
 large numbers of{police in riot gear, 
 carrying shields.{Petrol bombs}were   
 thrown and large numbers of injuries  
 were sustained on both sides. At the  
 height of the rioting the{Rialto,}an  
 old cinema converted to a furniture   
 warehuose was{burnt to the ground.    
{Looting}of shops was rife with the    
{Lodge Lane}shopping area worst hit.   </content>
