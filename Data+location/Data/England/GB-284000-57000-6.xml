		<title>06SAILING IN STOKE GABRIEL</title>
		<content> In Stoke Gabriel there is a Boating   
 Association. In the Junior section the
 boats are called Optimists, Toppers,  
 and Mirrors. The mirrors are used for 
 two people to sail. If you use your   
 own boat you have to pay thirty pence 
 but if you use the club's own boats   
 then you have to pay a little more.   
 If you need rescuing there is a rescue
 service  that will come to you very   
 quickly.                              
 We meet every week-end in the summer, 
 but we don't sail in the winter       
 because the water is too cold. When we
 meet at the clubhouse we talk about   
 the season and the boats that need    
 painting. Every month we have a talk  
 by a local man. At the end of the     
 season we go to the clubhouse for the 
 club awards.
