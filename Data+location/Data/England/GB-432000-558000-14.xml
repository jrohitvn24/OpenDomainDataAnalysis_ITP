 In 1925 employment was mainly in      
 coalmining and shipbuilding.  People  
 provided their own entertainment.     
 Usually journey's to Southwick or     
 Washington were walked.  Many were    
 jobless.  The area around Hylton      
 Castle was farmland, only being       
 developed after the 2nd World War.    
 Colliery houses had two bedrooms, a   
 living room, washouse and boiler in   
 the back yard.  Washing was hung in   
 the back lane.                        
 Work was hard, wages low, hours long. 
 There was only a Lloyd George pension 
 scheme, pensioners receiving ten      
 shillings per week. Health was poor   
 and life expectancy not going much    
 beyond 65 years. Dr Holiday was the   
 only G.P.and the National Health      
 Service did not exist. The three R's  
 were taught and at 14 you left school.</content>
