		<content> The Parish Council at East Dean       
 consists of seven elected members who 
 administer the local needs of the     
 community. They meet every six weeks  
 and are able to express their views on
 local planning matters. The village   
 pond is often under discussion; roads,
 drainage and footpaths are also their 
 concern. Charlton parish comes under  
 Singleton Parish Council. They have   
 four elected members representing them
 on the council.
