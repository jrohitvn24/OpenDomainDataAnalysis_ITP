		<title>07CLEE HILL AREA WATER SUPPLY</title>
		<content>     Until 1984 this area has had its  
 water from{The Elan Valley Supply.}In 
 December we changed to water from the{
{Trimpley Works,}which draws water from
 the R.Severn. The supply was switched 
 because there would be a pollution    
 problem, as the Elan reservoir was    
 open and very old.                    
     When people in this area were     
 first told that we were to change our 
 water supply, they started to protest 
 and complain because other areas had  
 had problems. When we first got the   
 water in our taps, people said it was 
 undrinkable and over chlorinated. The 
 water has a different taste and smell,
 and also caused skin rashes and mouth 
 ulcers.The new water is harder.       
     The level of chlorine has now been
 reduced. People are beinning to get   
 used to it, and recently there has    
 been few complaints.                  </content>
