		<title>01THE MIDHURST AREA</title>
		<content> Midhurst is a small country town in an
 area of great natural beauty which    
 local authorities and population try  
 hard to preserve.Unspoilt by heavy    
 industry or military installations,it 
 is a thriving,comparatively affluent  
 area.The mild climate attracts elderly
 people to live here after             
 retirement.The Health Centre and      
 Community Centre are the envy of many 
 larger towns.There are many clubs and 
 societies catering for people with    
 special interests like amateur music  
 and drama.For professional            
 entertainment we must go to nearby    
 towns like Chichester.Midhurst has    
 state schools for children from       
 surrounding villages after the age of 
 1O.The old buildings,spread through   
 the town,and polo matches played in   
 and near Midhurst attract many        
 visitors from home and abroad.        </content>
