		<content> Historically,the area was dominated by
 the docks and the old associated      
 industries.The area surrounding the   
 docks is densely populated,and        
 contains many homes that are in very  
 poor condition. Unemployment is       
 extremely high.To try to counteract   
 this,the area was made a freeport.    
 The Government has also directed jobs 
 to the area eg.Girobank and Inland    
 Revenue Offices. As you move away from
 the docks the housing standards       
 increase,although the vast majority is
 municipal housing.                    
 There are a number of parks and open  
 spaces.The north-east of the area is  
 bounded by Bootle Golf Course and     
 Walton Prison dominates the south-east
 boundry. The schools tend to be       
 post-war buildings away from the dock 
 area. The Roman Catholic church is the
 dominant religious influence.         </content>
