		<content> Sporting activities are important in  
 our school,such as football, netball, 
 rounders, cricket and cross-country.  
 The netball team has been very        
 successful in recent years.School     
 productions such as 'The Wizard of    
 Oz'and'Oliver'have been staged and    
 have been extremely popular. The      
 latest technology is used in our      
 school. We have 2 BBC micro-computers 
 and a video recorder.School clubs are 
 also important.There is a gym club,   
 badminton, choir, recorders and sports
 practices of all kinds.School life can
 be very interesting and enjoyable if  
 you are prepared to make the most of  
 it.
