		<title>02PORKELLIS Cornwall - Housing</title>
		<content> There are only three small villages   
 in this area; PORKELLIS, Carnkie and  
 Penmarth, each with a population of   
 only a few hundreds. Due to a higher  
 than national average of unemployment 
 these populations are in decline as   
 the young move away to find work.     
 Housing is therefore confined to      
 traditional granite faced houses and  
 cottages, and a few bungalows built in
 the 1950's and 1960's. There is a     
 small council estate at Carnmenellis  
 of half a dozen homes.The rest of the 
 area being farm land the housing      
 consists of traditional granite built 
 farmhouses.
