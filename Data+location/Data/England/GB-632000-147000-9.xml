		<content> There are two Women's Institutes in   
 the area, Ashley-with-Studdal W.I. and
 Mongeham and Ripple W.I..             
 Women's Institutes are associations   
 for women only for the purpose of     
 education.   They are a part of the   
 National Federation of Women's        
 Institutes.   Most Institutes meet    
 monthly and usually hear a talk by a  
 Speaker or Demonstrator on a wide     
 variety of subjects.   They also      
 provide time for members to           
 communicate with each other.   W.I.s  
 are non-party political and non-      
 sectarian but concern themselves with 
 a wide range of contemporary issues,  
 working towards the improvement of    
 community life.   The motto is "For   
 Home and Country".
