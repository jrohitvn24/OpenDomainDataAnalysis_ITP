		<title>20PROJECTED PLANS FOR FAIRFORD</title>
		<content>   A recent review of the public       
 property, facilities and a            
 questionnaire to all inhabitants is   
 currently under consideration for a   
 future town structure.  To reconcile  
 the practical and economic factors    
 with the ideal of the majority the    
 immediate plans are for a new Primary 
 School to be built close to Farmor's  
 School on the north-east of the town; 
 a new Police Station and Library to be
 built on the Primary School site with 
 conversions of the Victorian Infant   
 School and Police Station and         
 Magistrates Court.  Allotment gardens 
 in Quenington Rd., rented from the    
 District Council, will have to be     
 vacated and a new site is being sought
 in Horcott.  A weekly street market is
 planned for l986 and would revive     
 ancient trading traditions which date 
 back to the l2th century.             </content>
