		<content> Children at Brixington Junior School  
 answered with the help of their       
 parents. Most children were born in   
 Exeter, but as Exmouth has no         
 maternity hospital this really means  
 that they think of themselves as      
 Exmouthians. Most parents come from   
 other parts of Britain and have       
 settled in Devon. The commonest type  
 of house lived in is a 3 bedroomed,   
 semi-detached with 2 lavatories and a 
 garage; built in the last 5 years by  
 Wimpey Homes. There are lots of 4     
 bedroomed detached houses being built 
 near school so our survey would change
 in a year or two. Out of 190 families 
 185 have at least 1 car but nearly all
 children walk to school. Everyone felt
 there should be more shops in         
 Brixington and many children would    
 like more play-space with equipment or
 an adventure playground.              </content>
