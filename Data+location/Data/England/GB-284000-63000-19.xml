		<title>19Marldon.Sun Valley Nursery.</title>
		<content>{Sun Valley}nursery was bought in 1979 
 by Mr and Mrs Templeman.They sell most
 of their flowers and plants in autumn 
 and spring. They sell less of their   
 plants in the winter.                 
 Their sons do not work on the nursery 
 a lot. They spend approximately Â£5000 
 a year. They are going to expand the  
 nursery in the near future.           
 Mrs.Templeman's favourite flowers are 
 roses and carnations.                 
 They buy cuttings, seeds, peat,pots   
 and polythene with the money they get 
 each year.                            
 Mr.Templeman does not know if his     
 children will take over.              
 The nursery is at Farthing Cross .it  
 started in a field about 10 years     
 ago,with polythene tunnels.These were 
 damaged by gales.The owners put up    
 timber wind barriers to stop this     
 happening again.                      </content>
