		<content> The Cobb as you see it today plays a  
 large part in Lyme Regis.  It provides
 full time employment for the local    
 fishermen all year round, and,        
 supplies a safe Haven; not only for   
 the local fishermen, but for any other
 fishermen around the area.            
 The Cobb is a major attraction to the 
 tourists.  It's famous due to the     
 visit by 'Jane Austen' and the filming
 of 'The French Lieutenants Women'.  It
 has many other historic attractions   
 too.                                  
 The Cobb is also the towns main       
 defence from the sea.  If it were not 
 for this barrier most of the town     
 would have perished under the waves   
 brought in by the strong              
 South-Westerley winds.
