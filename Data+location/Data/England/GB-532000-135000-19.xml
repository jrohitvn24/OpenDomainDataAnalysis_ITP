		<title>19CRAWLEY DOWN'S VILLAGE HALLS</title>
		<content> Crawley Down's first{Village Hall}was 
 built in{1890,}when the village       
{population}was about{700.}By{1970}the 
 number of people had{doubled}and the  
 need for an{extra hall}began to be    
 realised. In{1979,}following a{public 
{meeting,}a committee was formed to    
 raise money for another hall. The     
 building of a{new junior school}left  
 the old building available and, by    
{1983, Â£39000}had been raised to buy   
 it. At the same time a{new pavilion   
 was bought for the{Haven Sports Field.
 The{old school}was renovated at a cost
 of{Â£15000}and extended and furnished  
 to accommodate a{social club}for a    
 further{Â£35000.}The hall opened in    
{April 1984}and the Social Club later  
 the same year. It was officially      
 opened, as the{Crawley Down Community 
{Centre,}by the{Earl and Countess of   
{Chichester,}on{July 5th. 1985.        </content>
