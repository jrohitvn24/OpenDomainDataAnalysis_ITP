		<content> Meriden was mentioned in the original 
 Domesday Book, and at that time the   
 land was held by the{Countess Godiva  
 ,wife of Earl Leofric. She became     
 famous for her exploits as a          
 horsewoman through the city streets of
 Coventry, if the old tale is to be    
 believed!!!                           
                                       
 The original name of the village was  
{Alspath,}places of that name still    
 appear in the village, but from the   
 15th Century onwards it was known as  
{Meriden.                              
                                       
 The village grew with the importance  
 of the road from London to Holyhead,  
 and when the road was turnpiked in    
 l821, trade increased still further.
