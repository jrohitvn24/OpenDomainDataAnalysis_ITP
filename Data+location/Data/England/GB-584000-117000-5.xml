		<title>05THE TILLINGHAM AND THE BREDE</title>
		<content> The two rivers which form our northern
 and southern boundaries are the       
 Tillingham and the Brede.  Both rivers
 are small and sluggish.  The Tilling_ 
 ham is really shallow and would not   
 support a boat of any sort for most of
 its length through Udimore; the Brede 
 would support a small rowing bioat,   
 being about four feet deep at most.   
 But well within living memory coal    
 barges came regularly up as far as    
 Brede Bridge.  And up to the end of   
 the last century quite big boats      
 could sail u p the Tillingham.  A mere
 l50 years ago both valleys were inlets
 of the sea and as such were ideal     
 haunts for smugglers.  Both valleys   
 still flood after prolonged rain, but 
 many fields now have land_drains which
 clear the water quite quickly.
