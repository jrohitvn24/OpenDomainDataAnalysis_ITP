		<content>    The different subjects we learn at 
 school are Maths, Computer Studies,   
 English, Religious Education,         
 Humanities, Art, Drama, Music, French,
 Gymnastics, Games and Crafts.         
    The crafts we do are macrame,      
 crochet, sewing, knitting, woodwork,  
 pottery and cooking. For macrame we   
 tie knots in string and make lovely   
 things. For sewing we make clothes and
 felt toys. We crochet hats and        
 shawls. In cookery we make cakes and  
 pies and all sorts of delicious food. 
 Volunteer mothers come in to help the 
 teachers with these activities.       
    We all try to be good Christians in
 this school, which is a happy, loving 
 and caring community just like the    
 village.
