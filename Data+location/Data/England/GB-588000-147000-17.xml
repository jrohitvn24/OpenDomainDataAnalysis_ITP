		<title>17St James _ Friends and Bells</title>
		<content>  The Friends of St James was formed in
 recent years to raise money for the   
 Church Fabric Fund. Events held       
 throughout the year include Lectures  
 and Buffet Suppers, Farm Visits, and  
 Houses and Gardens open for visitors. 
   The bells of St James's date from   
 1602_1927 and are rung on Fridays and 
 Sundays by an active band of local    
 ringers. At present there is a core of
 9 ringers plus beginners who not only 
 ring at Egerton but give valuable     
 support to other towers in the area.  
   In 1985 the band has had 2 ringing  
 outings to other districts, played    
 host to the Ashford District Annual   
 Call Change Competition (and won it), 
 a New Year's dinner party for about 20
 ringers and a barbecue for Egerton and
 Charing ringers. We also ring for     
 weddings and at Christmas ring carols 
 on handbells around the village.      </content>
