		<title>17TOURISM IN PANTON</title>
		<content>{PANTON}is not at first glance an      
 obvious area for tourists but it has a
 fair number of people travelling      
 through it for that reason. Two homes 
 in the area supply bed and breakfast  
 for visitors and there is a steady    
 stream of visitors during the summer  
 months. The recent erection of the    
 Humber Bridge has made Lincolnshire   
 more accessible to travellers from the
 north and the bridge itself is a      
 tourist attraction. Visitors come to  
 the area from all over the world to   
 visit Lincoln with its history and its
 beautiful cathedral. Lincolnshire also
 attracts cyclists and walkers. Most   
 visitors to {PANTON }remark on the    
 beauty of the landscape and the       
 feeling of space. The current average 
 rates for bed and breakfast are Â£7 for
 bed and breakfast per person and Â£2.5O
 for an evening meal.                  </content>
