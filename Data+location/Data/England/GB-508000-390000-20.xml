		<title>20RURAL MINISTRY MIDDLE RASEN</title>
		<content> In recent years a complicating factor 
 has caused adaptations of the         
 parochial system. The central         
 administration of the Church of       
 England,the Church Commissioners, now 
 administer all glebe, rents and       
 patronage benefits, and fees are      
 balanced as part of a rationization   
 and balancing of stipends for both    
 urban and and rural clergy.           
 Hence, with modern transport, the     
 Rural Ministry has become based upon  
 several parishes. The parish priest   
 thus covers a large area with a       
 variety of village communities and    
 hamlets.                              
 Within this context, mechanization and
 European Agricultural Policies create 
 their own problems for the farming    
 industry, therefore affect the        
 economic stability, or otherwise, of  
 the Rural Church.                     </content>
