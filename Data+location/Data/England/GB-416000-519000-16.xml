		<content>    Mrs.Bell taught at Ingleton School 
 before retiring in 1981.She enjoys    
 living in a quiet, country village    
 like Ingleton.She has seen lots of    
 changes in the village; fewer shops,  
 more houses and a new school. Mr.Bell 
 was the village policeman, Mr. Arthur 
 Horner was the joiner and Mr.Brass was
 saddler. When Mrs.Bell came to        
 Ingleton there were many horses, but  
 these have disappeared.               
    Mrs. Bell said there used to be a  
 well on the green at Ingleton  , and  
 there was Maggie's Well and one at    
 Fairholme where a man was drowned.    
 Mrs.Horner has a well still in use.   
    Today homes have been modernised   
 and have fridges,washing machines,    
 freezers and central heating. Even gas
 which has run through the village for 
 years,is supplied to the homes built  
 in 1984-5{By S.Lawless and T.Ormerod  </content>
