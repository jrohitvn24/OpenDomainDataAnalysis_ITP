		<content> The historic nature of Bath has caused
 more than usual outcry at any new     
 plans to build in the city. There is  
 no doubt that hideous mistakes were   
 made in the past e.g. the SOUTHGATE   
 development and the BALANCE ST. FLATS.
 The BEAUFORT HOTEL also caused        
 concern. However in the last decade a 
 more thoughtful approach to planning  
 appears to have been adopted. Recent  
 developments such as the              
 PLUMMER-RODDIS building, the          
 development in Abbey St and the       
 restoration of GREEN PARK STATION have
 all been highly successful and won    
 many awards. There is no doubt that   
 further developments will take place  
 before the end of the decade. The next
 development will be in the centre of  
 the city close to the ROMAN BATHS and 
 will need care and thought.
