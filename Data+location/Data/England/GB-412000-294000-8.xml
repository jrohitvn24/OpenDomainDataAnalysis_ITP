		<title>08NEW HALL MILL SUTTON C'FLD</title>
		<content>  {Medieval}New Hall is the oldest     
 residential building in Sutton        
 Coldfield.It is situated in the{Plants
{Brook Valley.}Some of the land has    
 recently been sold for housing.       
   Proposals have been made to change  
 the Hall into a{hotel,}to cater for   
 visitors to the National Exhibition   
 Centre and the Belfry Golf Course.    
   The Civic Society has not opposed   
 this change-if it means the survival  
 of an otherwise threatened building.  
   Nearby is the{17th Century water }  
{mill}which formerly ground corn from  
 the estate.The mill was driven by an  
 overshot wheel.Now it is just an      
 unusual residence.It is ironic that to
 drive the mill today,water must be    
 pumped by the electricity board.The   
 mill is{held in trust}to protect part 
 of our heritage for the appreciation  
 of future generations.                </content>
