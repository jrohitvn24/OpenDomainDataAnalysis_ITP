  The area lies mainly on the southerly
 slope from the ridge of the  Aire-    
 Wharfe divide down to the River Aire. 
 It is dominated by{Billing Hill}231m  
 above sea level,a local landmark.     
{Rawdon}village is in the centre of the
 D block,part of{Horsforth}at the      
 eastern end and{Yeadon}on the west.   
 These villages developed as wool      
 textile communities based on ancient  
 settlements.This function has declined
 greatly over recent years but each    
 village has kept some characteristics 
 of earlier eras.Despite much commuter 
 development during the last 30 years  
 the communities remain fairly compact.
 Adjacent open fields and woods provide
 an important social amenity.Much of   
 the area has been designated a{Special
{Landscape Area}by Leeds City Council  
 on the 1984 Local Plan.               </content>
