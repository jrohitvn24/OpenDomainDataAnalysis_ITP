		<title>12POPULATION IN LUGWARDINE</title>
		<content>   The number of people in this part of
 the parish is approx. 500, and because
 of the high cost of property and the  
 predominance of bungalows, a high     
 proportion of the people are retired  
 professionals or businessmen. There   
 are a few young couples with children 
 - they are the young executives in    
 middle management. This group has     
 tended to buy and renovate the older  
 properties.                           
   The people in employment work in the
 City or the County. None of the people
 are unemployed. Only St Mary's R.C.   
 High School offers villagers part time
 employment - as cleaners or kitchen   
 staff. The village shop employs 9     
 children to deliver papers. Some      
 seasonal work is available on farms.  
   Some younger wives do part time work
 often voluntary. They are not         
 motivated by financial need.          </content>
