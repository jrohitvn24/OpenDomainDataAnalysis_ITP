		<title>04HEDGEROWS AROUND WINCANTON</title>
		<content>  Throughout the year, hedgerows give  
 pleasure and interest. In{Spring,     
 flowers like Stitchwart,Bird's-Eye and
 Violets are common.{Summer}brings the 
 pretty blooms of Dogrose and honey-   
 suckle, whilst{Autumn}nuts and berries
 attract birds and small mammals.Bright
 ribbons of Bryony berries and the     
 fluffy seed heads of Old Man's Beard  
 (a lime loving plant and locally      
 common) festoon the{Winter}hedgerow.  
  Many hedgerow plants belong to the   
{carrot}family,like Hogweed.The{insects
 they attract are important to{farmers 
 because they pollinate crops,eg clover
 and fruit trees, and prey on pests.   
{ Hedge maintenance}is usually by flail
 mower but locally some are hand laid. 
  If a hedge has a large variety of    
 trees and shrubs in a short stretch,it
 is very old. Judging by this, some of 
 our hedges have quite a history.      </content>
