		<content>     These plants can make up a hedge, 
hawthorn, blackthorn, which gives sloes
that people make into wine or sloe gin,
buckthorn, dog rose, dogwood and       
brambles, which give blackberries for  
jam, puddings and wine. Wild clematis  
and ivy climb all over these plants as 
well as the oak, ash and field maple   
trees growing through the hedge, while 
underneath grow garlic mustard, called 
Jack by the hedge, nettles, periwinkle 
and meadow plants like field pansy and 
scarlet pimpernel.                     
     In the roadside verges grow sheep 
parsley, hogweed, poppies, alexanders, 
speedwell, plantains, snowdrops, self  
heal and thistles.                     
     In springtime there are primroses,
violets, cowslips and oxslips in       
ditches and woods, where dog's mercury,
bluebells, wood anemones, wild         
daffodils and orchids also grow.       </content>
