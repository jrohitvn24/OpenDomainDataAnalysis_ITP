		<content> The Water Museum in the former        
 Normanton Church was officially opened
 in June 1985.  As a church it was     
 originally built in 1764 for the      
 owners of Normanton Hall which was    
 sold and demolished in 1925.          
 after the land was purchased for a    
 reservoir the church was deconsecrated
 and burials reinterred elsewhere.  It 
 was found to be too costly to move the
 church but Â£30.000 was raised to built
 a bank around it and a causeway, and  
 raise the floor above the water level.
 It has now been improved     and the  
 present Water Museum show how the     
 provision of drinking water has       
 improved over the centuries.  The     
 displays are well done and during the 
 summer it is expected to attract      
 many visitors.
