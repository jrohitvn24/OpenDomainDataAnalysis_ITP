		<content> The quarry in our area is called      
 Loadfield Quarry.They are getting     
 sandstone from the quarry.It is bought
 and used for building,crazy paving,   
 walling and fireplaces. The stone is  
 very near the surface and the quarry  
 face is about 4 metres in depth.They  
 use machinery and hand tools to get   
 the stone.The blocks are loaded into a
 lorry.Some is taken away, some is     
 "dressed" and smalll pieces are       
 discarded.The "dressing"is  done on   
 the site in a large shed.A sort of    
 guillotine is used and hand-tools.An  
 old gentleman works here using a      
 hammer and chisel.He has worked here  
 for 45 years.The dressed stone had    
 beautiful patterns in rust and beige  
 colours.Five people are employed at   
 the quarry.The quarry is surrounded by
 spoil heaps which have been colonised 
 by heather, grass and bilberry.       </content>
