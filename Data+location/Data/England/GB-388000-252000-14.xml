		<content>{RELIGION }plays an important part in  
 the life of the people of the area.   
  The Berkeley family have been of the 
{Roman Catholic}faith since 1632 when  
 the elder son ,Thomas, converted and  
 was disinherited.  As there was  no   
 other male heir, Thomas's Catholic    
 son inherited the property and        
 the family began to use separate      
 chaplains and today , worship in their
{own chapel}in the Hall. There is a    
 Catholic cemetery  where more recent  
 family burials take place. Most of    
 the estate's employees are of the same
 faith.                                
{ All Saints Church}is not used by the 
 family,therefore and is a part of the 
 united parish of{Peopleton,Churchill, 
{Whiteladies Aston.}Parish services in 
 Spetchley take place in summer, on 1st
 and 3rd Sundays 11.15am and, in winter
 on 1st Sundays only.                  </content>
