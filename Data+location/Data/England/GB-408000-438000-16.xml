		<title>16The New Library in Bingley</title>
		<content> The present library was built in 1972 
 above the new Shopping Centre, and is 
 used by approximately 30% of the local
 population. It is divided into an     
 adult and children's sections, reading
 area, reference library and exhibition
 area.                                 
 Each day the library takes copies of  
 daily newspapers. The papers are read 
 by many people, including the elderly 
 and particularly, these days, by      
 people looking for jobs. Books are    
 issued by computer and may be kept for
 three weeks after which a fine is     
 charged. The most popular author in   
 the adult fiction section is Catherine
 Cookson and in the children's section,
 Roald Dahl. Exhibitions of paintings, 
 pottery and other crafts are held     
 regularly.
