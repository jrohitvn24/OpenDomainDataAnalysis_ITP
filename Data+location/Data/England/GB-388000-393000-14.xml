		<title>14REDDISH VALE LAND COVER</title>
		<content>  Our{tutor group}looked at three      
 different sections of land. Just      
 beyond a gate was the first piece of  
 land. It was covered with rough grass 
 and buttercups and was used for       
 grazing horses.In the centre of the   
 field were thistles and on the far    
 side were hawthorn hedges and         
 elderberry bushes.                    
  We saw two railway lines which       
 crossed one another. The line from    
{Manchester}to{Sheffield}was bellow and
 the line from Staly bridge to         
{Stockport}was above.                  
  A cobbled road led nowhere. A coal   
 mine in{Denton}closed in the 1920's.  
 Wagons would come up the road loaded  
 with coal. The second piece of space  
 of land was used for grazing.{Fresian 
 and{Jersey}dairy cows were eating the 
 grass which covered the land.         
 Some of the{valley}is waist ground.   </content>
