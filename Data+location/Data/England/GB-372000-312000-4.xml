 and 11 windows.It had a big lawn with 
 some trees in the background. There   
 was a bush shaped like a duck and a   
 long path made of slabs. There was a  
 hedge at the back of the garden and a 
 yellow border of flowers. There were  
 fancy patterns around the windows.    
 There was a door at the front of the  
 house with steps leading to the       
 garden. It was built about 1533 when
