		<content> Kingfishers and,recently,cormorants   
 have been seen catching fish. Many    
 other birds have been seen in the area
 including gold crest,pied woodpecker, 
 tawny,little and barn owls, nuthatch, 
 tree creeper,grey wagtail and kestrel.
 In one woodland is an active rookery. 
 Herons frequently fly over the area.  
 During the winter swans are seen and  
 fed on the river.                     
 In the woodland are about 10 active   
{badger setts,}some of which are of    
 considerable age.Several footpaths    
 criss cross the block, but most of    
 these are not much used by the public 
 The canal towpath offers a good foot- 
 path and frequently water voles and   
 other wild life can be seen. After an 
 absence due to myxomatosis rabbits are
 making a re-appearance. Hares are     
 plentiful,as many as five being seen  
 at one time. Annual rainfall is 700mm </content>
