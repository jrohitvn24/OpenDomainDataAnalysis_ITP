		<title>09 WORCESTER SWIMMING POOL 2</title>
		<content> On Wednesdays class 7 go swimming at  
 10.30.Some people go in the big pool  
 and some in the little pool.When we   
 get in the learner pool we swim round 
 in a rectangle shape.We all learn to  
 swim.On our first time we all have arm
 bands and a polystyrene board.When we 
 can swim we try to earn badges-green, 
 white,red,blue and personal survival. 
      When I go on my own it is        
 different because the ropes are not in
 the water.There is sometimes a dragon 
 to play on.It costs 80p for adults to 
 go in and 30p for children and        
 O.A.P's .                             
       There are also private baths    
 there.People go there to have a bath  
 because there are still some old      
 houses in Worcester with no bathrooms.
 There are Turkish baths too,where     
 people go to slim and get fit.
