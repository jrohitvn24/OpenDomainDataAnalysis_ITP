		<content> During the 1939-1945 war, the line was
 very important in a number of ways.   
 Because of enemy action, the lines    
 around the north of London, in        
 particular the North London Railway   
 were frequently blocked. The          
 Cambridge, Sandy, Bedford, Bletchley  
 line was used for diverted freight    
 trains from East Anglia and           
 Lincolnshire to Southampton, South    
 Wales and the West Country.           
 Large numbers of personnel were moved 
 along the line to the many R.A.F and  
 U.S.A.A.F airfields in East Anglia,   
 together with supplies, including     
 munitions.                            
 After the war, traffic reverted to a  
 few freight trains for mainly local   
 produce and the passenger trains.
