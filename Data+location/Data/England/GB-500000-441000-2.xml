		<content>    The general Population (pop.) of   
 the area of Leconfield has changed    
 gradually over the years and has      
 greatly increased since the opening of
 the airfield in 1936 which had ceased 
 its operational status in 1965 but was
 used intermittently up until 1976.    
    There were 192 poll-tax payers in  
 1377.In 1672 there were 66 Households 
 in the two settlements 16 of them     
 exempt from the hearth tax; 50 had a  
 single hearth each, 11 had 2, 3 had 3 
 or 4, 1 had 5 and 1 had 6.            
    In 1743 there were 50 families, the
 pop. in 1851 was 362, in 1901 it was  
 347 which dropped to 283 in 1931      
 possibly due to the deaths caused by  
 the First World War (1914/18). In 1961
 the pop. was 1412 and currently there 
 are just over 2000 inhabitants of the 
 village. Many more come to work at the
 Army School of Mechanical Transport.  </content>
