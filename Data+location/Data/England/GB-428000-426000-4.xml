		<content> The school is very big and has three  
 blocks ,A,B and C blocks.&lt;It sounds   
 like a prison>.There are 35 classrooms
 in the school and is effected by      
 falling rolls.Sometimes the windows   
 are smashed by vandals.The slates are 
 knocked down by vandals.              
 The pupils love a uniform of          
 blue.There are lots of teachers in the
 school.Mine were called Mr.Wilding and
 Mr.Wintle.                            
 There is a cookery room ,two art rooms
 ,two librarys and three halls ,plus a 
 C.D.T Room.                           
 The halls are big and each hall has a 
 house point board for  house          
 competitions.Everytime you do some    
 good work you get some house          
 points.There are three teams; Eagles, 
 Hawks and Falcons.I was in Eagles.The 
 school also has a football,cricket and
 rugby teams. By C.Brent.              </content>
