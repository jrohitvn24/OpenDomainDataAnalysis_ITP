		<content>Father Cyril Barlow is the priest at   
St. John Fisher Catholic Church in     
Cofton Rd. The church was built between
1963-1965 and cost 97,000 pounds. It   
serves a parish of about 6500 people.  
Three services are held on a Sunday,   
two on Saturday and are on every       
weekday. A shared service is held with 
St. Annes,  John the baptist and       
Longbridge Baptist churches once a     
week. Within the next year the church  
hopes to build a parish centre to used 
by various groups in the commuity. The 
Rev. Nick Bralesford is the vicar at   
Wyhall Lane. There is no church        
building for this part of the block so 
services are held all around the area. 
Sunday services are held at the hall on
the Fairway. Rev.Bralesford moved to   
Kings Norton in spring 1985 after      
spring as a curate in Shelfield and    
Leicester.                             </content>
