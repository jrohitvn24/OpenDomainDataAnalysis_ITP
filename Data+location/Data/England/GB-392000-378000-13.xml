		<title>13VILLAGE SCHOOL, ADLINGTON.</title>
		<content> The school has 67 pupils from a large 
 catchment area. It is situated by a   
 road with fast traffic,several        
 accidents involving parking of cars   
 have occured so a lay-by is planned   
 far 1986 making access safer. In 1985 
 school uniform was introduced,( going 
 against a modern trend to abolish it.)
 with unanimous parental approval.     
 Educational methods are traditional   
 and modern, the result being similar  
 to that of a large family with a      
 balance of fun and discipline.        
 Parents are actively involved in      
 school-life helping with reading,     
 crafts, sports and Brownies. Parents  
 also play an important  part in school
 government. Education here is a       
 partnership between teachers, parents 
 and pupils making a thriving village  
 school.
