		<title>15ST.IVES "TIMES AND ECHO"</title>
		<content> 1 St.Ives is one of the few places in 
 England to have an independantly owned
 local newspaper.                      
  Established in 1910 the{Times and    
{Echo}has a circulation of four        
 thousand but it is estimated to have a
{saturation readership}of twelve       
 thousand. Its two journalists cover   
 stories of chiefly local interest. At 
 present the{Dog issue}is the main     
 story with articles and letters       
 supporting and opposing the district  
 council's dog ban on Porthmeor beach  
 and it's introduction of a dog warden.
 The{letters page}is always lively and 
 there are often{contributed}items on  
 local history and the arts.           
  Twenty people are employed by the    
 printing company who publish the paper
 weekly, as well as being general      
 printers and stationers.
