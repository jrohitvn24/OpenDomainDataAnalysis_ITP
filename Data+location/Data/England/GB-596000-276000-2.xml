		<content>The population of Barningham has grown 
dramatically recently, with the        
addition of 2 private housing estates &amp;
the influx of personnel from nearby RAF
Honington. There are Council houses,   
some of which are privately owned. It  
is a caring community with many volun- 
teers working for local charitable     
organisations. While some villages are 
dying Barningham is expanding but with 
a considerable migratory community.    
Market Weston is a smaller,quieter     
village, apart from the noise of RAF   
Tornado aircraft overhead.The County   
structure plan allows little new       
development but several old cottages   
have been renovated with grant aid.    
There are some Council owned houses &amp;  
2 old peoples bungalows.Both villages  
have main drainage (due to their loca- 
tion some proterties use septic tanks),
water,electricity &amp; GPO services.      </content>
