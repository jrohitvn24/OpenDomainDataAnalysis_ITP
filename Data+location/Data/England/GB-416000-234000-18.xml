		<title>18Spittle Farm</title>
		<content> Michael and I interviewed Mrs. Spittle
 who has been farming  for 23 years.   
 The farm is a mixed farm with 300     
 acres of grass land and 120 acres of  
 arable land. There are 380 Sheep and  
 30 calves which are for beef.To be a  
 farmer you do not need a lot of       
 qualifications, but you need a lot    
 sense and patience  and a love of the 
 land and of animals. You have to be   
 willing to work in all weather.       
         Mrs.Spittle likes her job and 
 says the advantage of working in      
 Blockley are that it is quiet.The     
 disadvantage is that the land is      
 nearly all hilly.She employs one      
 helper and her son specially when     
 lambing.                              
         Mrs.Spittle does not know     
 all the history of the farm.
