		<title>06 Coppicing (1)</title>
		<content>In Denstead Lane,near to Chartham      
Hatch,we interviewed two woodcutters.A 
lot of the 'lengths' of chestnut       
coppicing are carried up to a firm in  
Scotland to be made into               
snow fencing.Chestnut is used          
because of its strength.One of the men 
was the son of the fencing firm's      
owner Mr.D.Ramsley. The firm had been  
going for 30 years.They operate in a   
20 mile radius of Challock.The land    
itself is owned by either farmers or   
other landowners.Areas of the coppicing
called cants (defined by agreed        
markers that differ in each new plot)  
are auctioned off for cutting          
again every 14 years.Then it re-grows  
out of the side of the same root and   
trunk stock.The cutters have to be out 
of the wood by the end of May to avoid 
damaging the new growth.
