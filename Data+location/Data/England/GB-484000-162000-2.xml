 VISIT FROM PRINCESS DIANA             
                                       
  This week Princess Diana visited     
 Ravenswood Village. She opened a rose 
 garden made possible by donations. The
 princess arrived by helicopter and    
 later talked to the children and      
 teachers. Ravenswood Village is for   
 the mentally handicapped.
