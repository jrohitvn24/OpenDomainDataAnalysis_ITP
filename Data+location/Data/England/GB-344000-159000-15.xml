		<title>15LEISURE</title>
		<content>  Leisure is an important part of our  
 lives today.A lot of people spend     
 their time keeping fit by walking or  
 jogging the Mendip Hills.Because      
 uneployment is low we have less       
 leisure time. We did a survey to see  
 which leisure activites were most     
 popular in our area.                  
   Sports were more popular with       
 children than grownups,but it was the 
 most popular all round;while music and
 craft were close second with children.
 Fewer adults mentioned music and      
 craft. Children also enjoyed reading  
 but more grown ups mentioned reading. 
 Gardening was favourite with adults.  
 Most men said that they spent their   
 leisure time working on cars. Knitting
 and sewing were mentioned as being a  
 pastime for some ladies.
