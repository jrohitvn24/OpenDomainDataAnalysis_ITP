		<content> Footpaths &amp; bridleways are widespread 
 &amp; well used, much clearing &amp; mainten- 
 ance having been recently undertaken  
 by the Chiltern Society &amp; the Whelpley
 Hill Riding Club. Farmers with paths  
 over their land are mostly            
 cooperative, with some exceptions.    
 There is an old cattle pond notable   
 for yellow flags on the Green at Ashl-
 ey Green, &amp; a deeper pond with water  
 plantains in the centre of Whelpley   
 Hill.At 600ft, the climate is fairly  
 severe in winter with more snow than  
 Aylesbury Vale.In the winter two dist-
 inct fog patterns are experienced- hi-
 ls under cloud base &amp; the valleys cle-
 ar,or the high ground sunny with dense
 fog in the nearby valley towns.Rainf- 
 all is about 25ins a year.With no con-
 nurbations, the air is reasonably unp-
 olluted as shown by lichen &amp; fungus   
 growth.                               </content>
