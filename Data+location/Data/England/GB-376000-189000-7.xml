		<title>07Trout Farm and Water Mill</title>
		<content>{Alderley Trout Farm,}is by the river  
 in Alderley. The owners work 24 hours 
 a day, 7 days a week. It used to be a 
 mill and dyeing shed. The house is 200
 years old. They have 12 cats and about
 320000 trout. There are 6 small round 
 pools for the smallest fish, then they
 are moved to larger round pools. When 
 ready they are moved to bigger        
 rectangular pools. When ready for     
 eating the trout are moved to smaller 
 rectangular pools. They are all       
 rainbow trout, and are sold fresh,    
 smoked or frozen.                     
{Kilcott Mill}is believed to be  the   
 only mill in the area still using it's
 historical machinery driven by water. 
 There has been a mill on the site for 
 centuries. The present restoration has
 been done to the style of the 1825    
 mill. The water wheel is inside the   
 building.                             </content>
