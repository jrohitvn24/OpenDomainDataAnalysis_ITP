		<title>05The Beck, Snape, Yorkshire.</title>
		<content>   The Beck is a pretty part of the    
 village.It starts at Roskill,flows    
 through Snape to Snape Mill,then it   
 branches into various drainage        
 channels,some of which flow into      
 Bedale Beck and eventually lead to the
 River Swale.The Beck at one stage     
 flows beside Snape Castle.It flows    
 under the road about four times and   
 through many people's gardens.        
   The Beck is about 1m wide and a     
 quarter of a metre deep in most       
 places.Flowers like daffodils,        
 celandines, forget-me-nots and        
 buttercups grow beside it. Minnows,   
 frogs and water voles are found in    
 certain places. The Beck is often     
 cleaned out using gripes and diggers.
