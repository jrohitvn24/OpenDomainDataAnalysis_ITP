 cats and one dog. He has got thirty   
 seven acres of land divided into four 
 fields.He has old tools hung up on the
 walls around the brick shed.          
 In the farm house there is a well     
 30 feet or 10 metres deep.They        
 sometimes grow corn in the same fields
 every year but try to rotate the      
 crops.They don't live in the farm     
 house any more because it is very     
 big and difficult to heat,so they live
 in a bungalow.The house has been      
 empty three  years .The house was     
 built in eighteen forty five. They    
 have a muck spreader,baler,mowing     
 machine, bale loader,and hay turner.  
 Mr. Bick makes two thousand,five      
 hundred bales of hay a year. He hopes 
 to use the empty barns for a craft    
 work shop in the future.              </content>
