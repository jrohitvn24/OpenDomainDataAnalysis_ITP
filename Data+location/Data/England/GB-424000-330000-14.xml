		<title>14THE VEHICLE DEPOT,HILTON.</title>
		<content> This Army depot occupies a site of    
 approx.270 acres,and although an Army 
 unit,is totally manned by civilians.  
 The site was developed during World   
 War Two as a base for the U.S.Army    
 Engineers with some 3000 coloured     
 American servicemen stationed on it.It
 was especially suitable because of the
 railway at Egginton Junction. This    
 made the transport of troops and      
 equipment easier. Parts of the        
 Mulberry Harbour used after the D-Day 
 landings were assembled here. After   
 the war the site was taken over by the
 British Army and used for storage of  
 anti-aircraft guns,search- lights etc.
 The present accommodation was erected 
 in the 1950's, and now the workforce  
 is employed in the storage,repair and 
 maintenance of all types of passenger 
 and load-carrying vehicles for the    
 Army, Navy and Air Force.             </content>
