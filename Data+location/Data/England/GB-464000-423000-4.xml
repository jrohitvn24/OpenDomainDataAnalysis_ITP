		<title>04Carlton Pantomime</title>
		<content> Carlton pantomine began last year with
 Aladdin.This year's 'Robinson Crusoe' 
 was produced by Mrs.J.Atkin. We spoke 
 to Jacqueline Everatt a member of our 
 class who played Maria and married    
 Robinson Crusoe.                      
 "When I auditioned, I didn't really   
 expect to get a part, so you can      
 imagine how thrilled I was to be      
 chosen as principal girl. I was in the
 pantomime last year too and everybody 
 involved has great fun."              
 The money needed to finance the       
 pantomime comes from the proceeds of  
 Carlton Feast.In return any money made
 goes back to next year's Feast.The    
 parts are issued at the beginning of  
 December and rehearsals start in      
 January with 4 nights a week,leading  
 up to the actual performances of the  
 pantomime in March. The Carlton annual
 pantomime is a must for everybody.    </content>
