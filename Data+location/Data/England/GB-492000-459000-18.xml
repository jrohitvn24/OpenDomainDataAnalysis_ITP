		<content>      Lots of people like to go for    
 walks in the lanes around the village 
 and if they have a dog they like to   
 take that too.                        
      There is a cricket club and a    
 bowls club and they each have their   
 own pitches.Some people play golf on  
 the cricket field and some people     
 exercise their dogs there.            
      For people who don't fancy their 
 hand at bowls or cricket there is     
 always the pub.The pubs have darts and
 dominoes teams.                       
      For old age pensioners there is  
 the Darby and Joan club which meets in
 the village hall every two weeks and  
 they go on outings.                   
      Some adults help at the play     
 group and they enjoy that.            
      Sometimes there is something on  
 at the village hall like whist and you
 can go to that.                       </content>
