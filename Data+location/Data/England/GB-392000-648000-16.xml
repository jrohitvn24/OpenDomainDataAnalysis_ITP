		<title>16Salmon Fishing on the Tweed</title>
		<content> When the net is almost across the     
 river it is towed downstream by the   
 boat on the river and by the man onthe
 bank.When the boat is opposite the    
 landing,Usually a gently sloping beach
 of gravel,the coble is rowed across   
 releasing another rope attached to the
 other end of the net,known as ths     
 "stirrup". This rope is then puled in 
 as quickly as possible so trapping    
 any fish who swim up the wings of the 
 net to a bag on the end where they    
 remain until landed.                  
  The Salmon Company has to continued  
 to keep abreast of the times with     
 modern premises and plant.They have   
 their own fisheries on the river while
 others are owned privately and let.The
 fish are collected each morning by the
 fish merchant from Berwick or by the  
 Salmon Company.Cobles were tradition- 
 made of wood but are now made of glass</content>
