		<title>06A Day In Sharon's Life</title>
		<content>   I got up at 8.00 a.m. Lyndsey came  
 to call for me at 8.50 and we set     
 off for school. The first lesson after
 service was hymn practice until 10.00 
 and then we did Ginn Activity work    
 until playtime. There are 27 children 
 in my class, aged either 10 or 11.    
   After playtime we did some work for 
 the Domesday Project. We drew a plan  
 of our classroom until dinner-time.   
   I stayed at school and ate my packed
 lunch which was sandwiches, apple and 
 a drink. Some children have school    
 dinners costing 51p.                  
   At about 1.15 we came in to do      
 some S.M.P. Maths and then we watched 
 a T.V programme called Computers at   
 Work. School finishes at 3.30. In the 
 evening I played hide and seek, went  
 to Swimming Club and watched          
 television.
