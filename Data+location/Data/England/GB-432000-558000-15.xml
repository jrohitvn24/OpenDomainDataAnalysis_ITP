 and working hours were reduced. The   
 treatment of T.B. was improved.  By   
 1965 the village expanded and more    
 jobs were available. Housing food and 
 medicine improved, children left      
 school at 15 and the curriculum became
 more varied.

 celebrated by parties and dancing in  
 the street.                           
 Coronation Day 1953.  Some watched the
 ceremony on television.  Many people  
 coming together in one house because  
 of the lack of televisions. Street    
 parties were held at a later date     
 because of the wet weather.  All the  
 children at school received a         
 souvenir mug with the Queen's         
 picture and the coronation date - June
