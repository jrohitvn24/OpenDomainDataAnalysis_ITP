		<content>    People started to come to Southsea 
 for holidays about 100 years ago and  
 still enjoy the sea and beach today.  
 Other main attractions are {The Mary  
{Rose,HMS Victory, Southsea Castle and 
{the D-Day museum.                     
{   }Most visitors are day trippers but
 some stay longer, mainly in hotels and
 Bed and Breakfast accommodation. Most 
 tourists are British with an          
 increasing number of visitors coming  
 from Europe and America.              
     Portsmouth is becoming more       
 popular because of the emphasis on    
 maritime history with the naval base  
 being developed to include examples of
 our maritime heritage. A leisure      
 complex is to be built soon as well as
 a sea life centre and a new camping   
 site.
