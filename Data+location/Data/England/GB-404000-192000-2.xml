  Only a small percentage of the local 
 people rely on the immediate area for 
 employment; most travel to Swindon,   
 Cirencester, Cheltenham or even as far
 as London. A small number of people   
 come into the area to work, mainly in 
 gravel extraction and associated      
 indusrty.                             
{Leisure facilities.}                  
 The area is ideally situated for      
 leisure time activities.  The{        
{Cotswolds}are just a few miles away   
 with opportunities for walking, and   
 exploring in beautiful villages and   
 towns. Within a radius of a mile there
 are facilities for most water sports, 
 including water skiing, power boat    
 racing, canoeing, sailing, wind       
 surfing and angling. Local stables    
 provide opportunities for horse       
 riding.                               </content>
