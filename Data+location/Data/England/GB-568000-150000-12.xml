		<title>12TOURISM IN &amp; AROUND YALDING</title>
		<content>                                       
 Architecturally Yalding, and          
 especially the High Street, is one of 
 the gems of the Wealden area and      
 visitors come to admire it. Some      
 tourists visit Yalding because of the 
 late Edmund Blunden's association with
 the village. Churches at Yalding and  
 Nettlestead also attract visitors.    
 Both Yalding and West Farleigh are on 
 one of the springtime "blossom        
 routes", coach loads of tourists      
 coming to admire the apple, cherry,   
 pear and plum blossom. A route        
 designated "Heart of Kent Country     
 Tour" is now signposted. Both at      
 Wateringbury and Yalding the river    
 Medway brings visitors in summer      
 months. Yalding Lees (mostly to the   
 south of the block) is a recreational 
 area which attracts visitors.
