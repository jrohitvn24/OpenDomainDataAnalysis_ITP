		<title>10THE STOOLBALL MATCH</title>
		<content>     Stoolball is a traditional Sussex 
 Game rather like cricket but with     
 posts which are squares of wood on top
 of metal posts. We were going to play 
 a team from a nearby village called   
 Hurst Green. We set up the two posts  
 and waited for the visitors to arrive.
 The toss decided that our team was to 
 bat first. The bats have short        
 handles and a round head that is flat 
 on one side.                          
     Hurst Green had lots of different 
 bowlers and we were all out quite     
 quickly. We scored 21 runs. I caught  
 out one of the boys who had been      
 batting for a long time but in the end
 they beat us by 8 runs. Three Cheers  
 for Hurst Green, Hip, hip......       
     Afterwards we went home to have   
 tea.
