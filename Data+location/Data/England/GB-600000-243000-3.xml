		<content>  In one field the farmer was using a  
scare gun.It worked on calor gas and   
every ten minutes it gave a loud bang  
to scare the birds away from the young 
crops. The signs for footpaths were    
difficult to find.In some fields the   
farmers had planted his crops across   
them and we had to walk along the edge 
of the field or in the tractor tracks. 
  When we were walking past an oil-seed
rape field we saw some gun cartridges. 
That told us that people went shooting 
there,probably for partridges and      
pheasants.                             
  As we walked around the fields we saw
trees with very thick trunks which had 
been pollarded.This means that before  
the branches could grow they had been  
cut off and used for poles,fences and  
firewood.It showed us that the people  
in this area used and needed wood.
