		<content>  In this area there are varied        
 businesses, large and small, from     
 agricultural suppliers to antique     
 dealers. There is no shop in Broadwell
 now, apart from the Post Office, but  
 the shop in Oddington has existed     
 since 1728. It is used by locals to   
 buy groceries. It is also an off-     
 licence and post office. There are a  
 variety of shops within a five mile   
 radius but few large supermarkets. A  
 popular market is held every Tuesday  
 in Moreton-in Marsh where fresh goods,
 clothing etc. are sold. There are free
 buses to and from nearby villages.    
 Roadside stalls sell eggs and         
 vegetables, and an Oddington farmer   
 offers 'pick-your-own' fruit and      
 vegetables. Broadwell residents are   
 able to collect newspapers from the   
 Fox Inn and travelling tradesmen      
 (baker etc.) visit the village.       </content>
