		<content>                                       
 St. James' Church tower has a ring    
 of ten bells.Seven of these were given
 by St.Alkmund Church ,Derby.The other 
 three were cast from the original bell
 of St. James'.The oldest bell was cast
 in 1684.This ring of bells was        
 dedicated on 18th.December,1978 by the
 Bishop of Derby.New steel joists had  
 to be put in the tower to replace the 
 old wooden ones.                      
  The bells are rung by means of ropes 
 which are attached to wheels.The ropes
 have thick woollen pieces called      
 'sallys'.This is the part which the   
 bell-ringers pull.The other end of the
 rope is called the "tail-end".The     
 bells are rung on special occasions,  
 such as weddings and funerals and on  
 Church Festivals.People come from all 
 over the world to ring these bells.
