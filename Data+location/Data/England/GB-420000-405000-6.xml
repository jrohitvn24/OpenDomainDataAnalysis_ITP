		<title>06Gunthwaite Barn</title>
		<content> Gunthwaite Barn was built by{Godfrey  
{Bosville. }It is an old aisle barn.   
 It is a great, long barn which looks  
 like a church inside with wooden      
 pillars making the aisles.  It        
 reminded us of an old wooden ship.    
 The barn is held together with        
 wooden pins and there are no nails in 
 it at all.  The roof has been repaired
 and the barn has been divided up into 
 bays.  Outside where the big hall was 
 is an old, giant oak tree.  They  say 
 there are a lot of{Oliver Cromwell's  
 men buried beneath it.  The hall is   
 not there any more but two large      
 houses.  In the Civil War the         
 Bosvilles were on Cromwell's side.    
 To the east of the barn is Gunthwaite 
 Spa.  People used to come from miles  
 around on{Spa Sunday}but it is not as 
 popular now.  The water tastes        
 horribly of sulphur.                  </content>
