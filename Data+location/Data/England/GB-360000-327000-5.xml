		<content> Hodnet Church is very large and roomy.
 It has{an octagonal tower}one of only 
 2 in England.  It is made of{red sand 
{stone.}It has two altars but they only
 use the one. There are five stained   
 glass windows and they look beautiful.
     It has lots of brass and is kept  
 shiny. There is a Flower Rota. It's   
 for people to put their name on to    
 bring flowers to decorate the church. 
 The oldest part of the church is by   
 the door. Also there are windows      
 dating back to{Norman times (1066).   
 They are above the Gothic windows. You
 can still see the original Norman     
 arches. It has two naves and a private
 chapel for the{Heber Percys. }It has  
 quite a few pews and a vestry where   
 the choir get changed into their      
 robes. The church has a choir of about
 twenty people.
