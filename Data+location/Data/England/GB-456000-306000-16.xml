		<content>                                       
 On a school morning, I get up at about
 8 am though at weekends it varies     
 between 9 and 11, depending how tired 
 I am. I have a large breakfast of     
 cornflakes and rice crispies then turn
 the telly on. At weekends, I get my   
 bike out of the shed and go and       
 practise BMX stunts. Sometimes I play 
 with my puppy or kick the cat! I have 
 lunch about 1 pm and then if there's  
 nothing on TV, I will watch a video. I
 have to do odd jobs in the house and  
 one daily job is to tidy and hoover   
 the living room. In the evening I mess
 about with my mates on bikes or play  
 football and walk my puppy. One       
 favourite hobby is annoying my brother
 Shane. I usually go to bed between 9  
 and 11 depending whether there is     
 anything good to watch on telly.
