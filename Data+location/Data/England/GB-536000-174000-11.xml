his life.He is 23 years old and lives

There were no state nursery schools in 
the area and so his first experience of

Ball school at the age of 5.He remem-  
bers that it was a happy place where he
made many friends.He was taught Maths, 
English,craft &amp; sport.He went to Thomas

little for young people to do after    
work except drink in the  village      
public houses.
