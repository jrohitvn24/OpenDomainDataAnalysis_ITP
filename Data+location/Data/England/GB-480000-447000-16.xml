		<content>{Q. What do you think are the          
{advantages of going to Pocklington    
{School rather than Woldgate School?}  
 A. The boarders at Pocklington School 
 have to conform to stricter discipline
 than the day boys, and they have more 
 time to deal with all sorts of extra  
 curricular activity. They are often   
 better equipped in life to face its   
 rigours, particularly in such events  
 as the Falklands Crisis three years   
 ago. They are often stronger and      
 tougher in dealing with nasty         
 situations, than perhaps pupils of    
 Woldgate School.                      
{Q. Are pupils encouraged to integrate 
{into the town community?}             
 A. While there is nothing put in their
 way to prevent this, there are so many
 things going on at the school that    
 there is little opportunity for them  
 to integrate in the proper sense.     </content>
