		<title>04DE BEERS DIAMOND CORPERATION</title>
		<content> The De Beers Corperation is relatively
 new to the Sunningdale area:it moved  
 from London in 1975 to be closer to   
 the airport as it was expecting visits
 from overseas.Sunningdale is not as   
 industrial an area as its neighbour   
 Bracknell but De Beers,nevertheless   
 bought the site including a 1938 built
 mansion and 23 acres of land(3 of     
 which are now used as a guest area).  
 Being a Diamond Corperation,security  
 is very tight-including close-circuit 
 T.V. cameras.D.B.employs 83 people but
 only 12 are 'local'.No actual diamond 
 cutting is done on site-it is used for
 testing products,supplying industrial 
 diamonds and controlling the company's
 advertising.D.B.supports local        
 charities,the British Association of  
 Young Scientists,the D.B.Poster Scheme
 ,Ascot United Football Club,the Paul  
 Bevan Foundation and O.A.P/Youth Clubs</content>
