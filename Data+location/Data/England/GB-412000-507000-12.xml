		<content>   The layout of the milking parlour is
 known as a tandem system. It has three
 stalls down each side of a central    
 pit in which I stand and from where I 
 control the sliding door through which
 each group of three cows enter in     
 turn. The teats of each cow are wiped 
 with sterile paper to remove any dirt 
 before the clusters are put on and the
 extraction of the milk begun by the   
 suction equipment. whilst being milked
 each cow receives a carefully balanced
 ration of cow nuts which contain feed 
 supplements and other trace elements  
 to help keep it in good health and    
 maximise milk yields. As the cows     
 become dry, they are released in their
 groups of three and their stalls taken
 by the next three. They become used to
 this routine and instinctively know   
 their order of entry to the parlour.
