		<content> Buckhorn Weston is the only village in
 the area, lying in Dorset half a mile 
 from the Somerset border.It lies on   
 rising land overlooking marshy pasture
 to the west crossed by the river Cale 
 and a section of the Waterloo to      
 Exeter railway.Near the village is    
 Templecombe railway station. Also     
 nearby is an egg-shaped tunnel made   
 from bricks from the old village      
 brickworks now no longer in production
 although the family who owned it still
 lives locally.The village has all the 
 amenities including a service station 
 for motor vehicles. There are several 
 farms which are mainly for beef and   
 dairy cattle. Many of the once        
 numerous footpaths linking these farms
 are now sisused.Marsh Court was once  
 the Manor House of Wincanton and was  
 linked to Stavordale Priory, the      
 Augustinian Priory in nearby Charlton </content>
