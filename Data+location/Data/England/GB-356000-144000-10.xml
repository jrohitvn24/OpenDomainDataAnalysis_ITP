		<title>10DULCOTE</title>
		<content> The name derives from{Dultingcote,}the
 cottage/shelter by the Doulting River.
 (Doulting was the former name of the  
 River Sheppey.) Dulcote is a{hamlet   
 lying in the{Sheppey Valley,}on the   
{A371}between Wells And Shepton Mallet.
 It is situated between the Mendip     
 ridge and Dulcote Hill.  The hill's   
 centre has been removed and its top   
 lowered by quarrying, but this is not 
 apparent from the village. Dulcote    
 consists of about 30 houses built of  
 local limestone and conglomerate. It  
 remained unchanged for many years, but
 recently new, quite pleasant, houses  
 have been built, partly from renovated
 farm outbuilding. There is a small    
 mission{church (1860)}and a{fountain  
 fed from Mendip groundwater. A mill   
 chimney and a house remain from the   
 former Sheppey Valley textile         
 industry.                             </content>
