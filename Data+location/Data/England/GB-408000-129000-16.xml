		<title>16Customs in Wilton District</title>
		<content> The custom of holding 3 sheep fairs   
 at Wilton has long existed. These take
 place during the 2nd week of August,  
 September and October by virtue of a  
 charter granted by Henry VI in 1433.  
 The Great September Sheep Fair is the 
 largest held in S.W. England. An open 
 market is held each Thursday in Wilton
 Market Square by right of an ancient  
 charter. A fun fair coincides with the
 October Sheep Fair. The ceremony of   
 Beating the Bounds takes place at     
 Rogationtide. Wilton has the largest  
 living Christmas Tree in the country  
 and the Mayor performs the ceremony of
 switching on the Christmas lights.    
 Quidhampton has its own version of the
 Mummers' Play which has been handed   
 down by word of mouth. It is performed
 at Christmas in the village inn.
