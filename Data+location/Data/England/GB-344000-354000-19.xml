		<title>19The Annual Fun Day</title>
		<content> Every year we have a Fun Day in a     
 field by the church at Coddington.    
 This year a man from the local radio  
 station called Marcher Sound opened   
 the Fete. We started off with a fancy 
 dress competition and I saw that one  
 child was dressed as an ice cream     
 lady, one was dressed as a dustbin and
 there was another girl with seed      
 packets and pots of flowers sewn on   
 her dress. After the competition we   
 bought some things and had a go on    
 some games.                           
 Later we heard the bells of Morris    
 Dancers, who were dancing on the road 
 and we went to see them. There were   
 about ten men wearing clogs and with  
 bells on their legs.                  
 At the other end of the field, men    
 were shooting plates all afternoon and
 they call this Clay pigeon shooting.
