		<title>03SOUTH FARM - LAND USE</title>
		<content> The 500 acres of land is split into 2 
 main uses:arable and livestock.The    
 crops include wheat-100 acres,oats-25 
 acres,barley-125 acres.Some of the    
 crops are grown for sale,some (such as
 the barley) kept for fodder.Oats are a
 new crop which the farmer is trying   
 for the first time in 1985.Animals    
 include 250-300 beef cattle, 100 dairy
 cows (Freisian) and some sheep, all of
 which graze on 250 acres. Scotch half 
 breeds and Suffolk Cross are two types
 of sheep being grazed.The approximate 
 yield from the dairy cattle is 310    
 gallons of milk a day. This milk is   
 regularly collected from the farm by  
 milk tanker and taken to the depot in 
 Portsmouth, where it is treated and   
 distributed nationwide.The beef cattle
 and lambs are fattened on the farm and
 then taken for slaughter at the       
 abattoir in Petersfield.              </content>
