		<title>15What Shaun does in Farndon</title>
		<content> Some nights after school me and my    
 friend Richard go to the BMX tracks   
 for a muckabout. At the track there   
 are 4 burns, 2 table tops and 2       
 whoops. After a time, if we get bored,
 we go to the field for a game of      
 football. At the field there are a few
 things to play on. There is a slide, a
 climbing frame and some swings. There 
 used to be a roundabout but it got    
 burnt down. On Thursday it is Cubs. We
 just do games on the first day back.  
 First we get in Sixes and then we do  
 Grand Howl. In that we squat down, one
 of the cubs say a line and we repeat  
 it. Then we do inspection; after that 
 we take off our caps and play a few   
 games before going home.              
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
