		<content> The many woods and fields provide     
 wonderful walking facilities, with    
 many footpaths clearly marked. In snow
 tobogganists enjoy the hilly places.  
 Attractive lanes provide pleasant     
 routes for cyclists and horse-riders. 
 Many people spend their leisure time  
 gardening. The Annual Flower Show is  
 held on the Village Green. The        
 Warbleton &amp; Buxted Silver Band plays  
 at the Show in July and is based in   
 the Village. The Church has a lively  
 choir who practice every week and a   
 team of bellringers. Many people enjoy
 shooting and there is a flourishing   
 cricket club and several private      
 tennis courts, but most facilities are
 outside the area, and many people     
 travel to Hailsham, Eastbourne and    
 Bewl Bridge for squash, swimming and  
 water sports, theatre, cinema and     
 evening classes.                      </content>
