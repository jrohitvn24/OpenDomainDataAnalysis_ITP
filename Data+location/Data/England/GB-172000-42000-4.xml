		<content> The{Four Burrow Hunt hounds}have been 
 tended by the huntsman, Mr.Hancock for
 four years. He has 34\ couples, or 69 
 hounds. He feeds them on raw flesh    
 from the animals which have died on   
 a farm. The hunt covers an area from{ 
{Camborne, Wadebridge}and nearly to    
{Helston.}About 60 people hunt at a    
 time. Some children go. It costs{     
{Â£17,000}a year to feed them and look  
 after the hounds. Mr.Hancock breeds   
 his own hounds but sometimes gets some
 from other hunts to improve the line. 
 They are exercised everyday through   
 out the time that they are not on the 
 hunt. They are fed everyday when they 
 are hunting and every other day when  
 they are not. The hunting season is   
 from{September}to{March.}They go out  
 Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday. They  
 do not hunt in the Summer because of  
 the young foxes which are being born. </content>
