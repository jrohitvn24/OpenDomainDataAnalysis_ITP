		<title>10MUSHROOM FARMING</title>
		<content>    Mushrooms are grown in horse manure
 and straw. The horse manure compost is
 sterilized at 60 degs. C to kill      
 bacteria harmful to mushrooms and to  
 encourage nutrients. The spawn is     
 cultivated on wheat germ and mixed in 
 with the compost. Every week prepared 
 compost, ready spawned, is delivered  
 to the farm. The compost is put on    
 shelves in a growing room at 25 degs  
 C. After 2 weeks the spawn will have  
 grown through the compost. A layer of 
 peat and crushed limestone is put over
 the compost. After another week the   
 temperature is lowered to 16 degs C.  
 A week later pin head sized mushrooms 
 appear. They are watered regularly.   
 Two weeks later the first crop is     
 ready. A new crop appears every 7     
 days. After 6 weeks the compost is    
 removed for use by gardeners.  A good 
 yield is 500lb. from 1 ton of compost.</content>
