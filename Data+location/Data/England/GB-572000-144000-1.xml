		<title>01MARDEN - A WEALDEN VILLAGE</title>
		<content> Marden is a village of some 2500+     
 people. Once almost totally dependent 
 on agriculture many of its inhabitants
 now commute to London and are young   
 married couples living in first-time  
 buyer housing recently built close to 
 the railway station, which is on the  
 main London-Dover line. Most were born
 outside the area. The farming is      
 predominably arable and Charles       
 Dickens comment on Kent "Apples,      
 cherries, hops and women" largely     
 holds true though cherries are almost 
 extinct. Cereals, especially wheat    
 and barley and increasingly oil seed  
 rape, can be seen. There is current   
 much concern about the effect of EEC  
 legislation in the hop industry. A    
 number of hop gardens have been       
 grubbed and further Oast Houses, the  
 farm buildings used in the drying     
 process converted to luxury homes.    </content>
