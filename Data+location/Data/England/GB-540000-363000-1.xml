 Lincolnshire Wolds and overlooking an 
 expanse of marsh and fens towards the 
 North Sea.It is mainly a rural farming
 area.The tower of Burgh-le-Marsh      
 Church 8 miles away across the marsh, 
 can be clearly seen.To the South      
 across the fens Boston Stump can be   
 seen on a clear day;this is some 17   
 miles away.The small river crossing   
 the area is called the Steeping;this  
 rises in the Wolds(where it was the   
 basis for Tennyson's famous poem The  
 Brook) and flows out to sea at        
 Gibraltar Point,a Nature Reserve on   
 the edge of the Wash.The Halton Parish

 style in 1350,it has a lofty tower and
 fine clerestoried windows.Both Alfred 
 Lord Tennyson and Sir John Franklin,  
 the circumnavigator of the North-West 
 passage were frequent visitors here.  </content>
