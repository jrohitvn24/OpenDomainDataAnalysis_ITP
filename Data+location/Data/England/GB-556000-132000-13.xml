 In Roman times almost everywhere was  
 dense forest.There were hardly any    
 clearings.Later the Normans came and  
 divided the area into                 
 strips(Rapes).The Neville family owned
 all of this area as far as the        
 coast.They have owned the area for    
 about 900 years.The Nevilles lived in 
 a castle in Eridge Park.In the        
 grounds,there is a spring called      
 Chalybeate Spring.Near the spring are 
 some caves.One of them is a smuggler's
 cave.It has a circular hole in the    
 roof where the smugglers dropped their
 contraband.                           
   All over Eridge Park,the Nevilles   
 built gothic style cottages so the    
 view from the Park was not marred by  
 ugly buildings.Sham Farm has a gothic 
 style wall to hide the farm from view.
