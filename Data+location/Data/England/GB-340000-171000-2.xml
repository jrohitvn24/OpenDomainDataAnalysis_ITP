		<title>02Clevedon by Katy Douch age11</title>
		<content> Clevedon is not a city and yet it is  
 not a village.It is a town which is   
 growing all the time.Clevedon is      
 between Bristol  (a large city) and   
 Weston-super-Mare (a holiday resort). 
 It is built on three different levels:
 the hills,the flat lands and the      
 slopes in between.The houses are all  
 different types.There are Georgian,   
 Victorian and modern day homes.New    
 houses and estates are being built    
 all the time.There are two shopping   
 areas:the Triangle and Hill Road.At   
 Clevedon we have a Victorian pier.It  
 collapsed a few years ago and is now  
 being rebuilt.We also have Walton     
 Castle,which is private so you        
 can't go and visit it.                
 There are lots of open spaces and     
 wooded areas in Clevedon....so it is  
 great to just go off and be able to   
 get away from the hustle and bustle.  </content>
