		<title>01Elsenham Jam Factory</title>
		<content>     Elsenham Jam Factory was founded  
 in 1890 by Sir Walter Gilbey when he  
 planted local orchards.               
     Since the re-building of the      
 factory following the fire in 1969 the
 company has done remarkably well      
 selling its produce to 35 countries.  
 The USA is its main market but it also
 does well in Germany, France,         
 Australia and Japan.                  
     Whilst some of the fruits for the 
 preserves are grown locally (notably  
 strawberries and damsons) many are    
 imported from abroad; apricots and    
 oranges from Spain; and cherries from 
 Holland, for example.                 
     It is quite a small factory, with 
 a growing reputation for quality      
 foods, its products are now considered
 upmarket.  It employs approximately 70
 people, almost half of them women.
