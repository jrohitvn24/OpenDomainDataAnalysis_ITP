		<content> Twenty yards to the south east,a busy 
 main road bypasses Ogbourne St George 
 village.It leads to Swindon and  to   
 Marlborough.The road is a little      
 quieter in the afternoon.I did a      
 traffic count for ten minutes in the  
 morning when 87 cars passed.Most of   
 the drivers were travelling from      
 Marlborough to Swindon.13 lorries     
 passed,most of them from Swindon.In   
 the afternoon I counted 61 cars and 9 
 lorries but there were also motorbikes
 and vans and a caravan.I can hear the 
 traffic from my house in the village  
 but it is not very loud.              
       There is a secondary road going 
 under the main road which goes to the 
 next village.It is a quiet road but   
 there is a bus service and some cars  
 use this road.The major road is not   
 used by pedestrians or bicycles.It is 
 a busy road for heavy traffic.        </content>
