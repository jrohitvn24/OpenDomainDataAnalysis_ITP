  We stay at our Nan's on Sunday's. I  
 wait until my Nan gets up before I    
 come down for breakfast in my         
 nightclothes. After breakfast I get   
 dressed and we all listen to the Les  
 Ross show on the Radio. He puts       
 families in contact with each other by
 telephone. My Nan always listens out  
 in case her name is mentioned. She    
 would love to speak to Uncle Mervin in
 Australia.                            
  I usually take Jess, Nan's dog out   
 for a walk before our Sunday roast and
 rice pudding. While Nan watches       
 television after lunch I take Jess out
 for another walk around the local     
 shops.                                
  When it's time for tea, Nan puts     
 bread and butter on the table so we   
 can make our own sandwiches, after    
 which it's time for a bath.           </content>
