		<title>03MUSEUM OF DARTMOOR LIFE</title>
		<content> The museum was first started by a     
 meeting in 1976 where they discussed  
 different things about the museum and 
 then in 1979 they started a charity to
 raise money for buying the museum.    
 In 1981 they started work to repair   
 the old buildings which consisted of  
 an old mill, which is the museum      
 itself, an old printers, which is the 
 Tourist Information Office. The museum
 was opened in 1981 by the charitable  
 trust, which has further ideas for the
 museum, for example they hope to build
 a display of crashed world war two    
 aircraft and to convert an old dairy  
 into a Victorian cottage. The museum  
 gives you an idea of the life         
 Okehampton people had in the 19th     
 century. The admission fee is 50p. for
 adults,40p for OAP's and 30p for      
 children.
