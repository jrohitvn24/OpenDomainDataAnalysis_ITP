		<title>05A FAIR OAK FAMILY DAY</title>
		<content>    I awake first when we are going    
 shopping. I get up first so that I can
 prepare myself. I wear something      
 smart. Most times we go to buy food.  
 We use our car to get there as we shop
 in Eastleigh or Southampton. There are
 not many shops in Fair Oak. My Dad    
 drives and Mum makes a list of things 
 we need. We all keep together when we 
 go out even if we are not going       
 shopping. We normally work together.  
    First we find the things we need,  
 compare the prices and then Dad pays  
 for the best quality and the lowest   
 price.                                
    We take a lot of money to the      
 shops. Sometimes we have our lunch at 
 the shops.We sometimes take my best   
 friend,Lisa, with us.                 
    In the shops you must behave       
 because they are crowded and you might
 damage the things that are for sale.  </content>
