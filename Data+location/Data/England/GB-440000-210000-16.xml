The nursery is in the former kitchen   
garden of Freeland Lodge which used to 
be the home of the Taunton family and  
is now a private nursing home. Mr      
Webster's parents took it over in 1960 
and he himself in 1973.                
                                       
He keeps shrubs, geraniums, freesias,  
clematis, and hanging baskets. His best
selling product is bedding plants, of  
which he sells 10,000 a year. In spring
which is his busiest season, he makes  
hanging baskets and pots the bedding   
plants. In summer it is quiet so he    
clears up and prepares for autumn when 
he is busy selling shrubs, bulbs and   
soft fruit plants. In winter he sells  
Christmas trees and pot plants, does   
some seeding and builds up stocks for  
spring. His favourite plant is         
chrysanthemum and he loves bees.       </content>
