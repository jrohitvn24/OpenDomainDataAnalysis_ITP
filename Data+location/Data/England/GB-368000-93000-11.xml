		<title>11E. CHARMINSTER - THE PAST</title>
		<content>  Dorset is rich in history, and even  
 this small section of the county has  
 reminders of the past.                
  Fifteen tumuli are noted on the maps,
 plus two mounds. There is a chalk pit,
 and also a disused chalk pit.         
  Evidence of medieval fields systems  
 can still be seen on Little Piddle    
 Down and Charlton Higher Down.        
  There is an Iron Age Farm site       
 between Holcombe Bottom and Charlton  
 Higher Down.                          
  Running alongside Charlton Higher    
 Down is the old Drove Road, the       
 medieval highway. Charlton Down is now
 enclosed with hedges.                 
  Foxbrake Wood has been cleared, and  
 is now used for arable farming - in   
 1985 it was Winter Wheat.             
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
