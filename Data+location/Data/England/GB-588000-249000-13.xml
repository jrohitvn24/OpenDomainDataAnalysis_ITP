		<title>13Life in Lavenham</title>
		<content>In Lavenham many houses,which used to  
be derelict,have been repaired.Shopping
facilities are adequate,though many    
people would like a wet fish shop in   
the village.A number of people shop in 
nearby market towns,for which a car is 
essential as there is little public    
transport.There are several buses out  
of the village,but few return.The      
biggest factory runs its own buses for 
its workforce.Many feel concerned about
the amount of traffic using the village
streets,especially heavy lorries on    
their way to nearby ports.Concern has  
also been expressed about parking in   
the streets,particularly of tourist    
coaches,and it is felt extra car parks 
should be built on the edge of the     
village.Tourism is welcomed for the    
trade it brings;several gift shops     
have been established to cater for     
tourist's needs.                       </content>
