		<title>02MY FATHER IS THE VICAR</title>
		<content> My name is Rachel.My father is the    
 vicar of the parish of St Philip and  
 St James .The Parish is around the    
 harbour area of Ilfracombe.The church 
 was built in 1863.My family live in   
 the vicarage.You can still see the    
 front door that was used by important 
 visitors and the side door that was   
 used by the tradesmen and poor people.
 My dad prepares his services on Friday
 ready for Sunday.He visits the sick   
 people and sometimes takes Communion. 
 He arranges baptisms and marriages    
 and funerals.He has a Parish on Lundy 
 Island which he visits once a month,  
 travelling on the Lundy supply ship   
 the Polar Bear.My mum takes a group of
 teenagers called Pathfinders on Sunday
 mornings.They sing songs and study the
 Bible.Sometimes it is exciting being a
 vicar's daughter.
