		<title>04PARISH CHURCHES</title>
		<content> There are two parish churches, at     
 Pyecombe and Clayton, but no Catholic 
 or Free Church. Clayton Church is well
 known in the area for its wall        
 paintings.  Clayton has its own rector
 but Pyecombe has joined with 3 other  
 parishes (Newtimber, Edburton and     
 Poynings) with one rector shared      
 between them. This means the number of
 services at Pyecombe has been cut     
 drastically. Pyecombe Church is in the
 top half of the village which is      
 divided into 2 parts: the original    
 part around the church and the        
 settlement along the A23 which was    
 built when the plague hit the upper   
 part of the village in 16O3. The      
 building, mainly Norman, is very      
 popular, particularly with walkers on 
 the South Downs Way. Its age is now   
 causing problems: recent replastering 
 of a damp wall has been expensive.    </content>
