		<content> The religious needs of the community  
 are served by the parish church, a    
 gospel hall and a monthly service in  
 the United Reform Church.  The parish 
 priest lives in Thorncombe  and shares
 his time between three other churches 
 in adjoining parishes.  He has the    
 support of a number of people on the  
 parochial curch council and leading   
 various church groups. The parish     
 experiences common difficultties in   
 getting younger members of the        
 community to regularly witness to     
 their faith.  They maintain their     
 endeavours through youth groups guitar
 groups and special services for young 
 mothers with toddlers.  The small     
 gospel hall seems busy and thriving   
 and in general although the           
 congregation would welcome more people
 to itself, the village is aware of its
 church and its value.                 </content>
