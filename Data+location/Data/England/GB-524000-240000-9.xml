		<title>09FARM TOUR TO SEE CROPS</title>
		<content>   We all got on a large farm trailer  
 and went for a tour of the farm. On   
 our way round we saw lots of fields.  
 Some of the grass fields had cows in  
 them. The ones that didn't were used  
 for silage. The farmer used to cut it 
 and make hay but it takes days to dry.
 Silage only needs one day. The grass  
 is kept in 'clamps' or 'bunker silos' 
 He lets it grow and cuts it once or   
 twice then he puts the cows in the    
 field. We saw fields of wheat and     
 barley. The Spring Barley goes in the 
 ground after the sugar beet. The      
 barley is used for beer or animal     
 food. The sugar beet goes to Bury St. 
 Edmunds for processing the unused pulp
 comes back to feed the cows. There    
 were several small areas of sweetcorn.
 These were cover and food for the     
 pheasants. The farmer does not shoot  
 but has friends that do. He rides.    </content>
