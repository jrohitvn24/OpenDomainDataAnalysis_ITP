As this is a rural area, the nearest   
town being seven miles away, it helps  
to be contented with village life. A   
lot of time is spent gardening. Flower 
gardens are well kept, and any excess  
vegetables are shared around.          
Electricity is mainly used for cooking,
but bottled gas or solid fuel is also  
used. Three meals a day, meat and two  
vegetables, for the main meal.Microwave
ovens and freezers aid cooking. Home   
baking, preserving and wine making are 
all popular, as is weekend entertaining
of family and friends.Dress making,'do 
it yourself' building, and a variety of
hobbies are undertaken. Home safety is 
generally good, but many house contents
and furnishings are non-fire resistant.
Most houses have pets. A dog is used as
a guard dog for many homes.
