		<content>  On {Saturdays}I wake up and think,"Oh
 brilliant,there's no school!" I lie   
 there for a while then go downstairs  
 and get the newspaper and my {Roy of  
{the Rovers }comic. I read my comic and
 the paper while I'm watching {Duran   
{Duran}on video. After that I have a   
 cup of coffee and a piece of toast.   
  I then get dressed. I always put my  
 jeans and sweatshirt on. I put on my  
 trainers and jacket and then I cycle  
 to my friend's house. There is one    
 friend who I always play with.We often
 go for a bike ride. After that we go  
 in for dinner.I watch{football}on     
 television while I'm eating my        
 vegetable soup.Afterwards my dad gives
 me some money and I go and see{Grimsby
{Town}play football at{Blundell Park.}I
 go home and watch television before I 
 have my tea. At about ten o'clock I   
 finally get ready for bed.            </content>
