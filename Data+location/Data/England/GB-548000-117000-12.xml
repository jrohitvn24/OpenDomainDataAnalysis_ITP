		<title>12Facilities in Palehouse</title>
		<content> Facilities in this area are rather    
 limited. The butcher, general store,  
 post office and public house have     
 closed recently. Residents now have to
 travel several miles to shop. Travel  
 is generally by car or on foot,       
 although there is a bus service which 
 operates during school terms. There is
 a children's play area which is only  
 used occasionally as there are few    
 children here. There is no church. The
 nearest is in Framfield which         
 communicates with Palehouse through a 
 noticeboard in the hamlet. Other      
 facilities include a telephone box and
 post box on the main road. The dustmen
 collect rubbish once a week and the   
 mail and milk are delivered regularly.
 The residents are mainly farmers      
 although some are commuters. In their 
 leisure time,most people go for walks 
 and collect wood for their fires.     </content>
