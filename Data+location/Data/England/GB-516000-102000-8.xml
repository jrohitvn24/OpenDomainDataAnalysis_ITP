		<title>08LOCAL HISTORY LANCING 1934</title>
		<content> We interviewed Mrs.Bonetti who moved  
 to Lancing in 1934.Lancing was made up
 of three shops and some houses and    
 nurseries.The road in which the       
 library and health centre now stand   
 was a track.Two Victorian houses stood
 here.One was demolished the other     
 named Penstone house.During the       
 Spanish Civil War the Basque children 
 were sent there,later it was made into
 an hotel.During the Second World War  
 concrete blocks were built along the  
 seafront as defence.People were not   
 allowed on the beach because of the   
 danger of mines.When asked Mrs.Bonetti
 said that she thought the main changes
 in Lancing were the vast explosion in 
 people and houses since the late 1930s
 New industries have come to Lancing   
 since the 1960's bringing even more   
 people into the area to work. By Cathy
