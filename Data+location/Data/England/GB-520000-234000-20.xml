		<content> The First Garden City Limited was     
 registered on Tuesday 1st September   
 1903,comprising 3,822 acres acquired  
 from the Parishes of Letchworth,Norton
 and Willian.It was said of Ebenezer   
 Howard "that within 5 short years his 
 visionary hopes for "Tomorrow" have   
 become the almost fulfilled           
 realization of today. The fortunate   
 community living on this estate will  
 rejoice in the knowledge that the     
 unearned increment which may result   
 from the rents of a population of     
 30,000 will not go to enrich any      
 individual landowner,but will be spent
 in such a way as will tend to refine  
 the lives,ennoble the characters and  
 exalt the minds of all who reside on  
 the Estate."                          
 Thus began the world's first Garden   
 City.
