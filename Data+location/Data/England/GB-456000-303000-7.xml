		<content> Mr. Smith, our{school caretaker,}works
 very hard, but he says his life style 
 is simple. He rises at 6am, has{tea   
{and toast,}and drives to work in his  
 Mini car. After unlocking and checking
 for vandalism in the mobile classrooms
 he attends to the gas central heating.
 The bottom is tidied after use by the 
 Boys' Brigade the previous night. At  
 8am he brings in the milk for staff   
 and children. At 9am he has a{tea     
{break}in his office. Between 9.10 and 
 10.15 he carries out general          
 maintenance. He runs the tuck shop at 
 playtime and brings in the school     
 dinners. Between 12.00 and 2.00 he has
 his{fish and chip lunch}at home, not  
 far from our Leicester city school.   
 School ends at 3.15 and Mr. Smith sets
 to work with his cleaning ladies. At  
 5.15 Mr. Smith goes home, returning on
 nights when the school is let.        </content>
