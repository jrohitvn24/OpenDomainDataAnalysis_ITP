		<title>20Our Domesday Survey Credits.</title>
		<content> This Domesday Survey entry was        
 compiled by the children and staff of 
{Grass Royal Junior School, Yeovil,    
{Somerset}during the summer of 1985.   
 Our intention has been to involve as  
 many people as possible. Over 300     
 children between the ages of 7 and 11 
 years have been involved in data      
 collection. The children have also    
 been responsible for the selection of 
 subject and construction of text. The 
 language is their's and the subject   
 matter of the text reflects what they 
 feel is important in their            
 environment.{We would like to thank   
{all the patient adults who have given 
{their time to us while we have been   
{compiling our view of the landscape,  
{industry, farming and lifestyles of   
{our area.
