		<title>16WALKING IN ACTON</title>
		<content> On the Domesday walks we have covered 
 about four square kilometres of land. 
 The fields mostly have pasture in     
 them.Sometimes the pasture is used for
 silage and sometimes hay.We saw wheat 
 and barley and some new grown maize.  
 There was rape aswell,rape has yellow 
 flowers and it is crushed to make oil.
 We also went to the church and up the 
 tower.You can see a moat from the top.
 We are going to the moat when we get  
 permission.                           
 When we walked down Ravens Lane we saw
 some wheat and some pasture.We saw a  
 farm called Madams farm.We saw maize  
 growing on Dig Lane.We got to Dig Lane
 by Swanley Lane and past Dorfold dairy
 house farm.When we went up Monks Lane 
 we past a moat,we past two dead       
 magpies.                              
                                       
                                       </content>
