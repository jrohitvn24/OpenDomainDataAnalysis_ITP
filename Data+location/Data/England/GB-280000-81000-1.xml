		<content> FARMING IS MAINLY IN THE AREA ASSIGNED
 TO THIS SCHOOL. WE HAVE IVESTIGATED   
 MOORHOUSE FARM . IT IS COUNCIL OWNED  
 AND IS FARMED BY A FAMILY CALLED JOLL.
 THEY HAVED FARMED IN THIS AREA FOR    
 TWO GENERATIONS. IT IS A MIXED FARM   
 GROWING POTATOES, SWEDES, TURNIPS, AND
 GRASS FOR THEIR DAIRY HERD. THEY OWN  
 46 cows AND THE MILK IS COLLECTED     
 DAILY FROM THEIR GATE.THEY FARM ABOUT 
 86 ACRES. THERE ARE THREE SONS WITH AN
 AGE RANGE FROM ELEVEN YEARS TO TWENTY.
 THEY ARE NOT SURE IF THEY INTEND TO   
 FARM WHEN THEIR FATHER RETIRES AS     
 FARMING IS AN UNECONOMIC ENTERPRISE IN
 VIEW OF THE MANY RESTRICTIONS PLACED  
 UPON BRTISH FARMERS THROUGH THE COMMON
 MARKET. THEY RECEIVE A SUBSIDY FROM   
 THE EEC AS MOORHOUSE FARM COMES UNDER 
 THE SPECIAL TERMS OF HILL FARMING.
