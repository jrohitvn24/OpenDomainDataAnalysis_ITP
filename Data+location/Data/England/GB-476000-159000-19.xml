		<title>19Eversley By-pass</title>
		<content>    We met{Councillor Philip Todd}who  
 told us about things which concern    
 Eversley people. He told us about the 
 need for a{by-pass}because of houses  
 being shaken by heavy lorries         
 thundering down The Street. The       
 by-pass has not been built yet as     
 there is not enough money available.  
    There is also a public enquiry     
 going on at the moment about the      
 amount of{gravel extraction}from      
 Eversley Common.                      
    Another concern is about{street    
{lights}in Kingsley Road, but only     
 about a third of the residents        
 wantthem.                             
    Eversley is also worried about what
 will happen to the area now that      
 British Car Auctions have bought      
{Blackbushe Airport,}particularly      
 because of the possible increase of   
 traffic through the village.          </content>
