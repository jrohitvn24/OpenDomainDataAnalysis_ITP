		<title>12Halewood - Church and School</title>
		<content>  The churches have maintained schools 
 in Halewood from the 1840's to today. 
 The Church of England School on Church
 Road, founded in 1841, provides       
 primary education for about 240       
 children. The Church of England also  
 has close links with most of the      
 county schools in Halewood, the       
 ministers taking assemblies on a      
 regular basis.                        
  The Roman Catholic Church maintains  
 one primary school and one secondary  
 school in our area. The secondary     
 school, St Pauls, is due to close in  
 the near future. Many people in       
 Halewood hope to keep the school open 
 as an ecumenical comprehensive school.
 There has already been a recent       
 Catholic primary school closure.      
     All the churches have Sunday      
 schools attached but attendance in    
 1985 is far less than in the past.    </content>
