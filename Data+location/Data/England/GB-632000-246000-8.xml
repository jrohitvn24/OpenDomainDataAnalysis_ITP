		<content> So far as the large American community
 in this area is concerned there are   
 less health problems than usual due to
 the adult age range of 18-45 years.   
 Military personnel undergo regular    
 rigorous health checks and physical   
 conditioning.  Again, due to the age  
 range there is a high birth rate. Some
 Americans choose to have babies in    
 local hospitals. The nearest American 
 hospital is at RAF Lakenheath. As with
 any other community at this time there
 are a few problems of drug and alcohol
 abuse. In common with any other rural 
 area the locals have a healthier atti-
 tude to illness than towndwellers, and
 because of their lifestyle seem to    
 suffer less from mental stress &amp; minor
 physical ailments. Local people are   
 served by a group medical practice    
 based at Alderton and hospital treat- 
 ment is at Ipswich General Hospital.  </content>
