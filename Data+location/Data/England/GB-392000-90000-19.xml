		<content> In our survey of how children  spend  
 their free time we found everyone     
 enjoyed doing different things.       
 The most popular activity is{watching 
{television programmes.                
                                       
 Some of the other pastimes are riding 
 bikes, playing chess, drawing, judo,  
 swimming, stamp collecting, recorder  
 playing, reading, horse riding and    
 walking dogs.                         
                                       
 We also made a survey of how adults   
 spend their  free time. We found that 
 adults do fewer things in their free  
 time than children. We thought they   
 probably had less time. The most      
 popular pastime is reading and        
 gardening. Some of the other pastimes 
 are D.I.Y, car maintenance, walking,  
 computers, and watching television.
