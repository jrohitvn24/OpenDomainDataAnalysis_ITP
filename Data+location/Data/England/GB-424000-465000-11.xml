		<title>11EVENTS VILLAGE GREEN</title>
		<content> On the village green we have just had 
 a school sports day and the day before
 that we had a rounders match with the 
 Young Farmers.The Young Farmers come  
 every week in the summer to play      
 rounders or cricket. Every year on a  
 Saturday in July we have a sports day 
 for all the village. Some times the   
 school children have PE on the green. 
 Across the track from the green are   
 the swings and the seesaw. This year  
 the village raised enough money to buy
 a new slide. Every year the church    
 holds an "It's a Knock Out".It was    
 opened by the Rector on July 22nd.    
 Sawley was one of eight teams taking  
 part. This year on Bank holiday Monday
 we had a barbeque for the first time  
 which was to raise money for a new    
 village Hall.Tourists often stop for a
 rest and have a picnic in summer.
