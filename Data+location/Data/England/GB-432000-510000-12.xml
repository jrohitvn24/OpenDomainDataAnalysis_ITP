		<title>12FARMING GENERAL INFORMATION</title>
		<content>  Farming in this area is very similar 
 on all the farms. The same crops are  
 grown in varying amounts on all the   
 farms, which are mostly arable. It is 
 not dairy farming country.            
  The farmers also fatten store cattle 
 for market as well as growing crops.  
 Some of the farmers also run sheep on 
 their grazing land. A few pigs are    
 also kept, and there is a chicken farm
 on one of the arable farms.           
  This all takes place within the      
 fertile valley of the River Tees.     
  There are two family owned and worked
 Market Gardens which cover 57 acres   
 between them, 4 of those under glass, 
 growing salad crops. The smaller of   
 the two provides solely for two stalls
 in the nearby Darlington covered      
 Market whilst the other produces for  
 wholesale distribution.
