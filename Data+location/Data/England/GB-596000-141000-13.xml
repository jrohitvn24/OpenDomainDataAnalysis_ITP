		<title>13A Typical Day in My Life</title>
		<content> I get out of bed at seven thirty every
 morning except in the holidays.After  
 washing and dressing I go downstairs  
 and have my breakfast.I sometimes help
 my mum with the washing up,do my      
 teeth,get my bag ready,fetch my jacket
 and walk to school.I arrive there at  
 about ten to nine,then when the bell  
 rings I line up ready to go into      
 class.After the register is called we 
 usually start with Maths,which I like.
 Sometimes we have a test after play or
 we do English,which is my favourite.We
 have a playtime before our lunch,which
 is at quarter to one.I like having    
 salad.Then there is just time for a   
 quick game of football before the bell
 goes at twenty-five past one for      
 afternoon school.The afternoon means  
 more fun and less hard work!Most of us
 prefer this,guess why?
