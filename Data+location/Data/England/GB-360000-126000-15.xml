		<title>15Planting a tree</title>
		<content>  On Monday 15th July a Horse Chestnut 
 tree was planted in North Cadbury     
 school playing field. Mr Barnes, head 
 of the school, gave us the tree. It   
 was planted by Stuart Down and Kieran 
 Woof.                                 
   They planted it to give shade, it   
 replaced a favourite old tree which we
 loved to climb. We hope that in many  
 years time Stuart and Kieran will     
 bring their family here to see the    
 tree they planted.                    
                                       
{"In class two I was happy because I   
{washed the sink all the time"}        
                                       
{"When I first walked into class three 
{I was very worried and by the time I  
{was settled down I had no nails left."
