		<content> Langley festival has been going on for
 10 years. So it is it's tenth         
 anniversary this year. It is a family 
 event so everyone is out and about. It
 usually takes place during the first  
 two weeks in July. Everyone can join  
 in at any age. For instance for the   
 very young ones there's a Bonny Baby  
 Show. There's a Punch &amp; Judy show at a
 local play group for the boys and     
 girls there. Local schools are being  
 visited by famous authors. For        
 teenagers to get them off the streets 
 is a disco and a breakdancing         
 competition for anyone interested. For
 the adults a folk evening. There are  
 lots of sports like Judo displays, Gym
 displays and for footballers a        
 football match with Middleton Police  
 and Langley Rangers. On the last day  
 there is a fair and a parade with the 
 Mayor and the Mayoress around Langley.</content>
