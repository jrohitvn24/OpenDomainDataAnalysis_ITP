{Gainford Annual Parish Meeting}was a  
 lively one with most of the 27 members
 of the public expressing strong views.
 The residents discussed the possible  
 re-routing of the public bus service  
 along the main road, rather than      
 around the{village green.}It was felt 
 that there would be an increase in the
 number of accidents if the buses were 
 to stop on the main road.             
 The chairman said that he was annoyed 
 with the state of the bus shelter by  
 the{village green.}It had recently    
 been cleaned and re-painted, but once 
 again it has been misused. He appealed
 to the youngsters and their parents to
 take steps and stop this continued    
 damage.
