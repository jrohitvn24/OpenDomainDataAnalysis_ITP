		<title>14TOWN CENTRE, RUGELEY</title>
		<content> The redevelopment of Rugeley has      
 preserved the pattern of streets and  
 squares in the town centre. Shops have
 been refurbished to give larger shop  
 front displays; the few new buildings 
 have been confined to 2 storeys. In   
 1980 the town centre was closed to    
 traffic and in 1984/85 the streets    
 were repaved in brick. New street     
 furniture of benches, cast-iron lamp  
 standards and raised flower beds in   
 the narrow streets suggest a period   
 charm. Most of the small, old town    
 houses have been demolished and       
 replaced by car parks and service     
 areas behind the shops. The old       
 covered market has been demolished    
 except for the clock tower. The new   
 covered market has 43 permanent stalls
 and a roof-top car park. Three new    
 supermarkets have been built on the   
 edge of the town centre.              </content>
