		<content>   The other day a hike was organised  
 by ADC Scouts (Aylesbury District     
 Scouts) they did all the organising.  
 On the way we stopped at the local    
 garage to get a chocolate bar and some
 drinks.It was from Coombe hill        
 Monument to Ivinghoe Beacon (over     
 night). When I got to Coombe Hill it  
 was raining a little so everybody was 
 wearing their spray tops etc. We left 
 at about 9.30 PM, walked through the  
 Hale and into Wendover Woods and down 
 beside Daniels Trudge picnic spot. We 
 arrived at Tring at 03.00 hrs, and    
 sheltered and rested in Tring Library 
 porch. This was built in 1984. We had 
 to climb a lot of the Chiltern Hills. 
 At last, after a long night we arrived
 at Ivinghoe Beacon at 05.00 hrs.,     
 tired but satisfied with our efforts.
