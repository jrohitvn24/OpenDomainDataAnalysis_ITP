 We asked Miss Ruglys about Charing in 
the future. In her view the new M20    
will be a great help for Charing in    
the future as it will take traffic     
away from the streets. Also the A20    
divides the village and it will        
make it a less dangerous  road.        
 We also asked Miss Ruglys about the   
School she told us that the school has 
changed a lot. There have been four    
extensions. The first two are the J2   
and J3 classrooms. They were built in  
1955. The second two extensions were   
built in 1966. They were the J4        
classroom and the hall. Then the       
infant block was built. The kitchens   
and dining room were also an addition  
to the school.
