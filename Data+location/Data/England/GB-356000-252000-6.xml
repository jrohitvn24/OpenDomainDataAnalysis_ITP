		<content> The farmholdings are mostly           
 approximately 200 acres with the      
 exception of two smallholdings and    
 three larger holdings of 400 acres.   
 The majority have a mixed husbandary  
 of corn, sheep and beef cattle. There 
 are two dairy farms with herds of     
 about 100 friesians. The two          
 smallholdings are grassland. The main 
 exception is Marston Farm of about 400
 acres all planted to poplars by Bryant
 and May for matches. However because  
 of cheaper imports the trees became   
 worthless and so the farm was sold. At
 present the owners are felling the    
 trees, the wood being used for pallet 
 making and the grass-keep let to      
 neighbouring farms. The farmstead and 
 cottages have been converted to       
 holiday accomodation.
