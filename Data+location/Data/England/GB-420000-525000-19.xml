		<title>19TIMOTHY HACKWORTH-2</title>
		<content> He was contracted to provide and      
 maintain the whole of the rolling     
 stock and locomotives.At the Shildon  
 Works he built locomotives for both   
 the Railway Company and others at home
 and abroad,the first engine in Russia 
 was built in Shildon.Engineers        
 training was in great demand in       
 Shildon.The first Shildon Engine Works
 built in 1825 consisted of a narrow   
 barn like building of the Blacksmith's
 Shop,with a total of 20 workers.In    
 1827 when the 'Royal George' was built
 there were 50.It is on record that    
 during the construction Hackworth was 
 at work by the light of a candle in   
 weather cold enough to freeze the     
 tallow as it ran down the candle      
 sides.One cannot help admiring the    
 genius,perseverance and courage of    
 Hackworth and his band of workers.In  
 1832 he opened his own Soho Works.    </content>
