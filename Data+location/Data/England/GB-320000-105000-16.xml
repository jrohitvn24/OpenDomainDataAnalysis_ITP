 chasing, skipping or ball games but   
 there are others too.                 
{Chasing games.}Tag or It is the basic 
 game where one person is on and he or 
 she tries to catch all the others who 
 avoid being tagged.A number of games  
 are based on this. {                  
{Ball It_}when a ball is used          
 to throw and tag people.{             
{Off Ground Tag_ }when players cannot  
 be tagged if they are off the ground  
 (eg.standing on a step). {            
{Sticky Glue_}where you stand still if 
 you are caught and you can be back in 
 the game if another player releases   
 you by crawling through your legs.

 between two points such as walls and  
 you may then be caught. One of these  
 games is {British Bulldog. (continued)</content>
