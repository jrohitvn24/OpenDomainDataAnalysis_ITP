		<title>04MUNDON FARMING - PROBLEMS</title>
		<content>   Some animals are a problem to       
 farmers.The worst problem is the Brent
 geese,which come in huge flocks and   
 destroy his crops by treading on them 
 and eating them.His licence only      
 allows him to shoot ten geese per year
 and so he relies on a small cannon,   
 bangers and fluttering things like    
 kites and balloons to frighten them.  
   Unfortunately geese get used to     
 these methods.                        
   Foxes are also a problem because    
 they kill chickens,ducks and even     
 small lambs.Shooting is the quick way 
 of abolishing them as hunting is not  
 very effective and poison or traps are
 too dangerous.                        
   Moles destroy the roots of the      
 plants and sparrows eat animal feed   
 and newly sown seed.
