		<content>   THE SAMPLE FARM COMPRISES 445       
 HECTARES OF LOW LYING LAND AROUND     
 LONCO BROOK(03740322). LIKE MOST OF   
 THE STUDY AREA THE SOILS ARE FORMED ON
 GLACIAL DEPOSITS WHICH OVERLAY        
 SANDSTONE.                            
   THE FARMING IS "MIXED" WITH WHEAT,  
 BARLEY, POTATOES, SUGAR BEET, OIL SEED
 RAPE AND PEAS BEING THE MAIN          
 CROPS. LIVESTOCK IS PREDOMINANTLY     
 DAIRY COWS AND BEEF CATTLE,           
 SOME INTENSIVELY KEPT PIGS WERE       
 RECORDED BUT NO SHEEP WERE SEEN.      
   MOST OF THE FARMS PRACTISE CROP     
 ROTATION AND THE FARM STUDIED USED A  
 FOUR YEAR CYCLE OF WHEAT,POTATOES,    
 BARLEY, SUGAR BEET. THE GRASSLAND     
 AREAS WERE MAINLY TEMPORARY LEYS WHICH
 WERE RESOWN EVERY THREE OR FOUR YEARS.
 THIS ENSURED HIGH YIELDS AND LOW WEED 
 ENCROACHMENT.                         
                                       </content>
