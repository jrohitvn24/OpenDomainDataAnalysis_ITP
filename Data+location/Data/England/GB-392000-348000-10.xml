  There is just one church in the area 
situated at Bagnall                    
  This church is Church Of England and 
was built in the 17th century and will 
hold up to 70 people.                  
  It stands in the main square in the  
centre of Bagnall and has a big        
influence on local life.               
  Sunday services are communion in the 
morning and even song at night with    
communion services on week day mornings
according to whats on in the church    
calender.                              
  Most of the Sunday services are well 
supported and in particular the church 
is well decorated and supported for    
the Harvest Festival.                  
  There are few baptisms and weddings  
because of the area.
