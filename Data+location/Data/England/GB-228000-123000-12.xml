 Around Clovelly there are several     
 farms of several hundred acres each,  
 formed by the amalgamation of the many
 smaller farms of days gone by.   Most 
 are{dairy farms}, which produce       
 silage, wheat, barley and oats grown  
 for their winter fodder.              
 Some hay is also cut when the weather 
 allows.   The{milk,}mostly from herds 
  of 100+ Friesian cows, is collected  
 in tankers and processed at the milk  
 factory at Torrington.   Many of the  
 farms also keep sheep.   One farm has 
 many pigs and another fattens cattle. 
  Most of the farms have one or more   
 dogs and several cats.Farm manure is  
 spread on the fields.
