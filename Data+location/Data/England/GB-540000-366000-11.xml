		<title>11SPILSBY CARNIVAL</title>
		<content> Dad made me up first.He used make-up. 
 He gave me a black eye,red freckles   
 and a scar.Mum gave me two black      
 teeth.My outfit was Dads old shirt    
 jeans and jumper.They were all cut up 
 and holy.When I reached Spilsby I     
 dimbed on my float.It was really lorry
 with a big boot made out of sacks on  
 the back.We all peeped out of the     
 windows exept for the six people      
 sitting on chairs outside.Soon we were
 off driving very slowly round the     
 town.My back was stiff and my legs    
 were aching,but I kept on waving and  
 smiling at everybody.Soon we heard the
 results.We came fourth. We had to     
 ride around the town again.My Mum,Dad 
 and my brother,Edward took two        
 photographs of me.
