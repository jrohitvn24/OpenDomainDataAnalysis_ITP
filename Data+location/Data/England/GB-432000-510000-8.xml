		<title>08SPECIAL RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL</title>
		<content>   Dinsdale Park Special residential   
 School which stands in 11 acres of    
 grounds, was originally built in 1680 
 as a shooting lodge.                  
                                       
  Various extensions and alterations   
 have been made by owners of the       
 property over the years, and when     
 Durham County Council bought the house
 in 1919 for Â£30,000 it was converted  
 into a residential school for mentally
 defective and deprived children.      
                                       
  Accommodation is available for 72    
 children of both sexes under the age  
 of 12.                                
                                       
  At this present time the school is   
 underused and is facing the threat of 
 closure
