		<title>10COMMUTER FAMILY</title>
		<content> Mr Lloyd-Kitchen's HOMELIFE contrasts 
 greatly with his work life in         
 London.The family have lived in       
 their 400 year old house in St.       
 Margaret's for 5 years. The peaceful  
 village has only one CHANGE since they
 moved there,that is the establishment 
 of a Buddhist monastery a year ago,in 
 place of a school for backward infants
  Mr Lloyd_Kitchen is a CHURCH warden  
 and the family attends church         
 regularly.                            
  One problem with the village,Mrs     
 Lloyd-Kitchen felt,was the lack of    
 TRANSPORT.  They have two cars in     
 regular  use and Mrs Lloyd-Kitchen    
 could not live without them.  Their   
 two daughters,aged 13 &amp; 15 catch the  
 only two buses from the village to &amp;  
 from school &amp; have to be driven to the
 youth club in Berkhamsted for their   
 main source of RECREATION.            </content>
