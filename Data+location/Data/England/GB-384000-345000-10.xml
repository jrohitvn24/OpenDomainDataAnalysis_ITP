		<content>The first market place was in Upper    
Green now the A34 Road.This moved to   
the High Street about 1280.The whole of
the present High Street would have been
a Large Market place.In 1203 the       
original Sunday Market was moved to    
Saturday,then to Monday in 1590.In the 
early  19th c.Saturday became a 2nd    
market day and later Friday a 3rd.In   
1853 the first covered market was built
to supplement the portable street      
market and to offer  a halfway house   
between shop and stall.This was        
replaced in 1963 by a more up-to-date  
covered market.There is also  a weekly 
cattle market (Monday), which since    
1871 has been housed in the Smithfield 
Cattle Market.The Market today is still
a thriving concern with traders selling
many types of goods at modest prices.
