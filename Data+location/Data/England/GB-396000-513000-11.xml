		<title>11The Bowes By_pass</title>
		<content>   The biggest event in Bowes in recent
 years was the opening in 1982 by Sir  
 Timothy Kitson M.P. of the Bowes      
 by_pass.This long awaited event now   
 means that traffic no longer rumbles  
 through the village on the A66 trunk  
 road.There used to be a lot of        
 accidents and some people were killed 
 but now the main street is quiet and  
 children can play safely.A local      
 businessman ,Mr. Alderson,who runs the
 garage thinks the village will slowly 
 decline but there is some evidence    
 that property prices are rising and   
 more people are attracted to a village
 which is not polluted by petrol and   
 diesel fumes and the constant thunder 
 of traffic.                           
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
