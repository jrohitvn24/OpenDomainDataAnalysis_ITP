		<content> The 3 km long stretch of coast is     
 dominated by 200-300 ft high cliffs.  
 The intertidal area is rocky. In      
 places the cliffs are broken and      
 vegetated. Farming uses the largest   
 area (except for sea) of mixed arable 
 and dairy, and there are several      
 farms. Caravan and holiday village    
 development cover nearly as much land 
 and most residents will be involved in
 catering to the needs of the many     
 summer visitors. Tourism is therefore 
 most important economically as        
 visitors come to enjoy the coastal    
 scenery and nearby beaches, as well as
 the facilities provided on the camps; 
 all that is necessary for self        
 catering holidays, as well as a pool, 
 amusements, pub etc. The Cleveland Way
 long distance footpath passes through 
 the area.                             
                                       </content>
