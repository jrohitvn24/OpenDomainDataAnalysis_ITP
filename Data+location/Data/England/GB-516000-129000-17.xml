		<title>17SAINT MARYS CHURCH CONT..</title>
		<content> nicely and we mostly have a reading   
 every week. There is a stoup too for  
 the vicar to wash his hands in but it 
 is not used now. In the graveyard     
 there are many graves. I can name one,
 the calvary cross. The bells ring     
 every service. There are lots of them,
 every one makes a different note. The 
 weather vane is a cockerel which      
 stands very high. It is metal with    
 gold gilt. Some of the church is over 
 600 years old.
