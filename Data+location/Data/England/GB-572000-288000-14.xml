 The 2 villages of Hockwold and Wilton 
 have now grown together. The 2        
 churches, under the patronage of Caius
 and Gonville College, are over 300 yrs
 old. The main street follows the route
 of an ancient sheep walk. Devil's Dyke
 an old fortification crosses north to 
 south across the section. The Black   
 Death{Plague}was brought to the       
 village by traders, via the river.    
 There are a few thatched and listed   
 houses of character. Legend tells of {
{selling wives}by auction on the Cross 
 Hill, and a secret tunnel to          
 St.Peter's Church. The village sign   
 includes{hare coursing}which is still 
 held today. Several inhabitants       
 emigrated to Canada in l912 after a   
 disastrous flood. The RAF &amp; Household 
 Cavalry have utilised the area for    
 training in both World Wars.          </content>
