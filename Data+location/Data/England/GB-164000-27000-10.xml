      The club provides social and     
 physical recreation for juniors from  
 9-14 and seniors 14-21 in their       
 leisure time. Activities include      
 gymnastics, judo, B.M.X., table       
 tennis, break-dancing and disco       
 dancing. There are play groups and    
 keep fit classes. At present the club 
 has 638 members. It is self
