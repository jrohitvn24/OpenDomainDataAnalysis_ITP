		<title>10  HOUSING IN THE LOCALITY</title>
		<content>  This area is dominated by Cotswold   
 style houses with limestone walls and 
 split grey stone tiles. Sapperton     
 village was much beloved by the       
 Sapperton School of Craftsmen in the  
 early 1900s, who ardently supported   
 this country style. Houses they       
 designed blend perfectly with earlier 
 ones. Hill View, north of the Rectory,
 one of the oldest houses, is a 17th   
 Century building with central gable.  
 Of 66 houses in Sapperton 60 are built
 of traditional limestone. 32 are      
 detached. The Glebe Housing Estate,   
 built in 1966, contains 8 OAP         
 bungalows and 12 semi detached houses 
 built in a style which harmonises     
 well. Far Oakridge has quite a lot of 
 modern buildings, while Frampton      
 Mansell is similar to Sapperton.
