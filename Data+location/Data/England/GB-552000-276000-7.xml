		<content> The main type of employment in this   
 area is associated with agriculture.  
 In the past there were large numbers  
 of men employed on the land as well as
 work for the seasonal worker (mainly  
 harvest time). Today, however the     
 opportunities are not as good. As     
 farming has become more and more      
 machine intensive the numbers of men  
 required has been drastically reduced.
 Their output has actually increased at
 the same time as one man can do much  
 more work with the help of machines.  
 Also the number of farms in the area  
 has declined leaving fewer but larger 
 farms thus reducing the opportunities 
 still further.                        
         In the area there is one small
 processing industry employing a       
 handfull of people.
