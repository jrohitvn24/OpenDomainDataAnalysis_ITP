      The Colne is the river that runs 
 in between Rowhedge &amp; Wivenhoe, there 
 are three main ports along the river  
 Wivenhoe, Rowhedge, and Colchester    
 so the river is quite busy with ships,
 the river is also used for pleasure,  
 there a quite a lot of sailing boats  
 and a few dinghgs.                    
      In Rowhedge there is not a lot of
 things for children to play so we have
 to think of our own games we can go   
 fishing, sailing, play football go    
 over the sand pits on bikes and on hot
 days go swimming in the river.        
      At one time there were plans     
 to build a bridge acros the river     
 which meant that even more lories     
 would go through Rowhedge but luckely 
 the plan was stopped.                 
                                       
                                       </content>
