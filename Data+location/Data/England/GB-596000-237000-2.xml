		<title>02Saint Mary's church Polstead</title>
		<content>The church of Saint Mary stands        
near to the remains of the Gospel Oak, 
probably a site of pre-Christian       
worship.The church dates from 1160 and 
has a  well preserved Norman west      
doorway and clerestory windows and     
arches . The church is built of        
ragstone and flint with Roman brick    
and tile.The Norman brick arches       
inside the church are an unusual       
feature,the bricks are almost          
certainly Norman and made not far from 
the church,In the 14th century the     
chancel was enlarged and a tower with  
a spire added. The spire is the only   
old stone spire in Suffolk.Larger      
decorated windows were put in.In the   
churchyard a small wooden cross        
marks the grave of the unfortunate     
Maria Marten.The original gravestone   
has been chipped away by souvenir      
hunters.                               </content>
