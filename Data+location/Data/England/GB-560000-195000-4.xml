 Mary's Church.Local people call it the
 Bluebell Wood because there are lots  
 of bluebells in it.There are rabbits, 
 squirrels,moles and field mice.Their  
 holes,mole hills and dreys are in     
 plain view.There used to be red       
 squirrels,but now it is all grey      
 squirrels.At night you can see bats.  
 There are over twenty-five different  
 species of birds.At one side there is 
 a meadow and at the other side there  
 is a farmer's field.There is a public 
 footpath leading to it.There are      
 several kinds of indigenous trees.They
 are hornbeam,birch,oak,ash,beech and  
 hawthorn.There are also several       
 rhododendron bushes.Some local people 
 walk their dogs there.
