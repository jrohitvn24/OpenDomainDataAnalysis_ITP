 Penistone.Out of the 5 farms we       
 visited there was an average of 39    
{dairy}cattle,13{beef}cattle,0 pigs,8  
 sheep,0 hens and 1 dog.Most land was  
 permanent pasture or sown grass,also  
 most farms made hay or silage.Most of 
 the farms were dependent upon their   
 products.                             
 Penistone was the most important to   
 them rather than Barnsley because of  
 the cattle market and shops.          
 There was an average of 4 tractors at 
 each farm.                            
 Most of the young people went to the  
 Young Farmers Club in the area.       
 Other{crops}grown where cereals,roots 
 and kale.
