		<title>07FLEETWOOD MARITIME MUSEUM</title>
		<content>    As Fleetwood has existed only since
 1836, the made-real dream of Sir Peter
 Hesketh Fleetwood, it has had a local 
 history Museum since the town's free  
 library opened in 1887. Three years   
 ago the Lancashire Museum Service     
 extended it to provide a permanent    
 Lancashire sea fisheries exhibition.  
 This is open from Easter to October, 6
 days a week from 2p.m.to 5p.m. plus   
 10.30a.m. to 12.30 on Fridays; 25p for
 adults and 10p for children.          
    On the ground floor is a free local
 history section showing Fleetwood as  
 it was:Fire Brigade, Lifeboats, buses,
 trains and trawlers. The Maritime     
 Museum in the basement has model      
 boats, a Wheelhouse, an Otter Board,  
 nets used for shrimping and displays  
 of types of fish caught in the area.  
 Most children love the Wheel House and
 thoroughly enjoy visits to the Museum.</content>
