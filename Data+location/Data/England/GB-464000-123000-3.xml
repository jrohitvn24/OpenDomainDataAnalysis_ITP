		<title>03FARMING</title>
		<content> The pattern of farming is dictated by 
 the nature of the land and by the     
 prevailing farming trends. Six        
 different farmers work the land but   
 for two of them this represents only a
 small part of holdings well in excess 
 of 1000 acres. The smallest farm in   
 the area is 100 acres. There is no    
 dairy, but one "outside" farmer grazes
 cows within the area. Dairying was    
 widespread until the early 1970s when 
 the local farmers accepted government 
 payments to stop dairying. Now the    
 pattern is to graze the water meadows,
 low lying land and steep areas        
 difficult to cultivate. One farmer has
 sheep and three have beef cattle. The 
 higher chalky downs are used for      
 cereals, the most popular of the      
 moment being the profitable oil-seed  
 rape and winter wheat.
