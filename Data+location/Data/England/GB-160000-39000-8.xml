		<content> At the time of our visit,most of the  
 other fields were being used to grow  
 barley,potatoes and peas. Spring and  
 winter barley are grown and used      
 mainly for animal feed.Several        
 varieties of potato are grown,        
 including "Record" which are used to  
 produce potato crisps. They are       
 particularly suitable for this because
 they do not blacken when fried. The   
 peas being grown are used to make dog 
 food but,being high in protein,could  
 also be used to help solve food       
 shortages in Thirld World countries.  
 Oil seed rape is also grown,which is  
 used for cooking oil and animal feed, 
 and may, in the future help out as a  
 source of energy. The crops in these  
 fields are rotated and another large  
 field is used as a seed bed for the   
 other crops grown. In this field were 
 vast numbers of plants.               </content>
