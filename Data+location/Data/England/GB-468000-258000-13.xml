  When the Second World War started    
 Kislingbury was swamped with evacuees 
 from London.{Three schools}and staff  
 arrived in Kislingbury.On{V.E.}day    
 many celerbrations were held and the  
 evacuees slowly drifted back to       
 London.                               
  Since the war and particulary with   
 the construction of the{M1}and the    
 expansion of Northampton,the village  
 has grown and some of the old         
 landmarks have gone.Many newcomers    
 have arrived and Kislingbury has      
 expanded.                             
{ Kislingbury has changed alot in the  
{last 900 years,who knows what will    
{happen in the next 900 years.}
