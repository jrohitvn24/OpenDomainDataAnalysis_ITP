		<title>02A MINER'S JOB - KILNHURST</title>
		<content> A pit is dark and dusty.  Some places 
 are hot and others are cold.  Some    
 places are dry and some are damp. Some
 places are lit up, especially the pit 
 bottom.  First a miner has to put on  
 his work clothes.  He puts on         
 overalls, helmet, boots, belt and     
 lamp.  Next he will go down the pit   
 shaft on a lift called a chair or     
 cage.  He then goes to his work place 
 by riding on a paddymail, or walking. 
 A paddymail is an underground train   
 pulled by a steel rope and driven by  
 an electric engine.  Next he starts   
 work.  My father installs signalling  
 systems for paddymails and rope       
 haulages.  He uses pliers, spanners,  
 screwdrivers and wire tensioners.     
 When work is finished he goes back to 
 the pit bottom and rides the shaft.   
 Then he has a shower and puts on clean
 clothes.  Finally he goes home.       </content>
