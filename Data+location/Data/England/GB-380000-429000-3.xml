To the North West of the area is a     
large area once occupied by Hapton     
Colliery, but this is now redundant and
of the land has been reclaimed and     
landscaped. The entrance to the mine is
a garden centre, and small light-      
industrial units are being opened      
both here and along the south side of  
the A646.                              
                                       
The colliery was the scene of a        
tragic pit disaster in the mid-sixties,
but continued as a working mine until  
the late seventies.                    
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
