		<title>13In our school playground</title>
		<content> There are a lot of different games    
 being played .The infants play a lot  
 of imaginary games like starwars,     
 monsters and heroes,The little boys   
 have the best imaginations .The little
 girls like to play ponies, swings,    
 skipping and chase.The eight year olds
 play schools a lot and twang.Twang is 
 a complicated game in which two people
 stand about two metres apart with a   
 big elastic band around their ankles  
 the other player jumps in and out of  
 the elastic in different patterns. As 
 the game progresses you can raise the 
 elastic. My age group play games like 
 camels,football,chain tag and swings. 
 We like single and bolt which is      
 played around a large rectangle. One  
 person stands in the rectangle and the
 others have to run past him either    
 singly or in a group. Everyone has fun
 in the school playground.             </content>
