		<title>08Moving House</title>
		<content> My name is Amanda Frain.I live in Race
 Hill.But I used to live  at           
 Underlane which is inside our         
 rectangle.We decided to move back into
 town because it was closer to         
 St.Stephen's School.Previously my     
 sister and I had a taxi to take us to 
 and from school.The new house is      
 better than the old one because there 
 is more space.I like it where I live  
 now because it is not such a long walk
 to town and all the facilities it     
 provides.We decided to move back into 
 the town because the countryside  was 
 less fun.We will,however,miss the     
 countryside because of the            
 quiteness,the animals that were there,
 and all of the farms we used to visit.
