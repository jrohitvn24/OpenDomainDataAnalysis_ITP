 The highest part of the moor,{Black   
{Brow,}is only{289 metres above sea    
 level but the wide expanse of heather 
 increases the impression of solitude  
 and remoteness.                       
                                       
 Some{black-faced sheep}still graze    
 this upland but financial problems and
 sheep kills by road traffic have not  
 encouraged management of the presently
 unfenced moorland habitat for sheep.  
{Sporting interest}however, also       
 requires heather management and has   
 been beneficial in some areas.Heather 
 from productive stands has been used  
 in attempts to reinstate sections     
 elsewhere which were devasted by the  
 fires of 1976.                        
                                       
 This most distinctive habitat is thus 
 still enjoyed by many.                </content>
