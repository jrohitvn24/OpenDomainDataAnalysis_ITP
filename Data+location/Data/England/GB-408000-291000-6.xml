		<title>06SOCIAL CONCERNS</title>
		<content> Many of our social concerns are caused
 by a lack of money being spent on     
 amenities for all age groups, e.g.    
 social clubs and leisure facilities.  
 Unemployment has been causing concern 
 for as long as I can remember.  People
 are being made redundant and cannot   
 get another job.  Sometimes young     
 people who cannot get jobs get        
 depressed and start taking drugs.  A  
 rise in crime is also worrying.  There
 is a lot of vandalism and more        
 burglaries than ever are being        
 committed.  The local Police          
 Superintendent says "I want to start  
 up more community watches which are a 
 great way for people to protect their 
 property."  A current worry is the    
 rise in rates which involves all      
 members of the community.  In line    
 with national feeling people here     
 would like a change in the rates.     </content>
