		<content> 0n Sunday it was my 8th birthday and I
 had a party at the Leisure pool.When  
 we got there we told the lady that    
 there were 12 of us .My daddy took the
 birthday cake to the cafe.Then we went
 to the changing room.We got changed   
 and we went to the big pool.We did    
 some jumping and diving and swimming  
 and we played with a ball. Then my    
 Aunty told us that it was time to get 
 out.Then we got dressed and we dried  
 our hair.Then we went to the cafe and 
 had our party.We had chips,fishfingers
 and baked beans,and we had jelly fruit
 and ice cream for our pudding and     
 after that we all sang happy birthday.
 My birthday presents were a camera,a  
 flower fairy doll,a care bear,and a my
 little pony's grooming parlour.I had  
 lots of birthday cards too.
