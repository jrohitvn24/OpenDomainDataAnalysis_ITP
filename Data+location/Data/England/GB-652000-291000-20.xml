		<title>20LOWESTOFT IN THE PAST</title>
		<content>  We asked an elderly gentlemen about  
old Lowestoft. He is most familiar     
with the North side of the bridge. He  
remembers the old swing bridge built in
1897. It used to be the fastest acting 
bridge in England. There were many     
cinemas &amp; entertainment halls; Earlier,
the Grand Cinema was the site of       
Lowestoft Swimming Pool. Other cinemas 
were The Kinema &amp; Cosy Corner.         
  The interviewee has lived in         
Lowestoft for 78yrs, 6mths, &amp; 22 days. 
He left school at the age of 14 &amp; he   
repaired the herring nets for the      
Lowestoft Fishing Industry.            
                                       
This information was compiled by       
pupils, teachers &amp; parents from the    
following schools: Kirkley Middle,     
Pakefield Middle, Fen Park Primary &amp;
