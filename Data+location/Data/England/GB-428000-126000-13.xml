		<content> Thatch is not so plentiful and cheap  
 today because the combine harvesters  
 do not leave good long lengths of     
 straw.                                
 Duncan's House is opposite the King's 
 Arms and it used to be an old smithy. 
 It has two storeys with brick and some
 timber framing. It has a thatched     
 roof. The Kings Arms is the only pub  
 in the village of Lockerley. It has   
 two storeys and is made of brick with 
 a hipped roof which is tiled. The pub 
 sign has a lion and a unicorn holding 
 up the King's coat of arms. It is on a
 background of blue, the lion is gold  
 and the unicorn is white. They both   
 have crowns.
