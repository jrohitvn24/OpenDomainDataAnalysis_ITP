		<title>07DECOY HOUSE</title>
		<content>   Decoy House was built in 1660 and   
 has two original Jacobean fireplaces. 
 It used to belong to the Norfolk      
 Estate.                               
  In the eighteenth century the water  
 baliff paid an annual rent of twelve  
 dozen ducks to Arundel Castle for     
 banquets there. The ponds date back to
 the 1660's. Their purpose was to      
 decoy ducks into landing so they could
 be snared. The Decoy House is now     
 owned by a vetinary surgeon. The ponds
 were in use until about 1870. The     
 ponds are used nowadays for           
 licenced fishing.  One of the small   
 ponds was drained by New Place Farm,  
 because they believed it to be the    
 cause of a disease called ague, a     
 type of malaria.
