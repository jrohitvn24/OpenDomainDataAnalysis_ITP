		<title>05WOKINGHAM - LIFE STYLES</title>
		<content>     Wokingham has grown from a small  
 market town into a commuter town for  
 London, Reading and Bracknell. A      
 variety of light industries centred on
 electronics has also developed here.  
 Life styles of the majority are       
 typified by London commuters,         
 computer/high technology workers and  
 the service industries. Most of the   
 people would be considered middle     
 class and community activities are    
 reasonably well supported.            
 Unemployment is low,and in general the
 town reflects the affluent life style 
 of most of the population with        
 expensive speciality shops, a range of
 supermarkets, but suprisingly few     
 restaurants. Housing costs are high   
 and most housing is privately owned.
