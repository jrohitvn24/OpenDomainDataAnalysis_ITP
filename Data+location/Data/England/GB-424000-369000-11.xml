		<title>11Gamekeepering at Chatsworth</title>
		<content>    The gamekeeper's year begins in    
 February when the hen pheasants are   
 caught up and penned at the rate of   
 seven hens to one cock.               
    The eggs are taken and set in      
 incubators, hatched and reared to six 
 weeks of age. Then released into the  
 woods in release pens holding from    
 500-2000 birds depending on the size  
 of the pen.                           
                                       
    The shooting at Chatsworth starts  
 mid-November and finishes 1st.February
 About half of the birds released are  
 shot. Vermin are trapped and shot all 
 year round.                           
    There are also Red and Fallow Deer 
 on the estate which are culled        
 annually and sold through the Farm    
 Shop along with the Game.             
    Chatsworth employs seven keepers at
 the present time.                     </content>
