 Today it is Saturday.My weekend       
 begins!I get up at 7.30am.and have a  
 lovely warm shower.After that I get   
 dressed and go into the kitchen. Then 
 I go outside and feed Smartie,my      
 rabbit.Afterwards I have my           
 breakfast.I have cornflakes which are 
 crispy flakes of corn.Then I go up to 
 the field next to our house and ride  
 my neighbours pony.Yum,yum dinner     
 time.After dinner I get ready to go to
 cricket with my dad.(Cricket is a game
 played with a bat and ball.The object 
 is to score as many runs as           
 possible.Then when it has finished,at 
 home I have my supper,for my supper I 
 have some crisps,(thin,crispy slices  
 of potato),And a cup of tea(tea is a  
 drink made from teabags or tealeaves  
 and hot water.At 10.15 I go to bed.
