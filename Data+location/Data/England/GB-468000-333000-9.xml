		<content>      Tankers bring milk from the local
 farms and empty it into the Creamery's
 silos, which hold 30,000 litres(7,500 
 gallons) of milk. After 24 hours it is
 pasteurised and put in a  holding     
 tank.The  starter(a type of bacteria),
 and rennet(to make the milk sour) are 
 added. Then it starts to turn into    
 cheese.The cheese goes onto the curd  
 table,where the curds are broken up.  
 After that the cheese goes into a     
 moulding machine then into a tray then
 into hoops which have a nylon net     
 attached to them.When the cheese has  
 solidified the net is thrown away.    
 After hand-cleaning the trays the     
 hoops are machined cleaned They wrap  
 the cheese in cling-film.And wax paper
 It goes in a oven.After that they put 
 them into crates and put the crates in
 a room which is 45 f if the cheese    
 gets warm it goes squechy and gooey.  </content>
