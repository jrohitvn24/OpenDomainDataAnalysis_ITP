		<title>18Watership Down</title>
		<content>   Kingsclere and Ecchinswell have     
 always been tourist attractions, but  
 since the publication of{Richard      
{Adams'tale of the rabbits on Watership
{Down,}they have become more popular as
 this poem by{Peter Hull}illustrates:- 
  See the stranger's car approach,     
 The lady with the map,                
 The window down, the worried frown,   
 Sun glasses on her lap.               
  They do not seek "The George &amp; Horn" 
 "The Swan", "The Star","The Crown",   
 The usual question's on her lips      
 "Where is Watership Down?"            
  We send them happily away,           
 Amidst the summer greenery,           
 Having vaguely pointed out            
 Bits of the local scenery.            
  We forbore to say that in these parts
 Rabbits are fairly rare;              
 But,inadvertently,it seems,           
 Mr.Adams has started a hare.          </content>
