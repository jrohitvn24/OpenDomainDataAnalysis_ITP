		<title>05       THE HOUGH</title>
		<content> The Hough is a moraine or mound left  
 behind from the Ice Age.Although we   
 know how it was made there is a legend
 that two giants stood and threw mud at
 each other creating two piles,the     
 Hough and the neighbouring Barff at   
 Thorpe Willoughby.The Hambleton giant 
 threw the most for the Barff is higher
 than the 40 metre high Hough.         
   The Hough(Which is owned by Selby   
 District Council)is mainly made up of 
 pines,bordered by oaks and a few      
 sycamores.If you are quiet and patient
 enough you may see some of the        
 wildlife that inhabits it,such as wood
 pigeons(Of which there are quite a    
 few)and grey squirrels as well as a   
 few blackbirds even yellow hammers.   
   Recently a'Trim Trail'has been      
 built,it consists of several wooden   
 obstacles used to help you keep fit.
