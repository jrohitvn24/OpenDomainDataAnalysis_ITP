		<content> focus for this. The Church has gained 
 from the new arrivals, and it seems   
 assured a future - many people become 
 involved in church money raising      
 functions, because they believe that  
 the church needs to be maintained,    
 even if they are not worshippers.     
      All in all, the parish seems to  
 have accepted the inevitable. It is no
 longer a parish of farmers and farm   
 labourers, but a mixture and those who
 earn their livings in the nearby towns
 of Kiddeminster and Droitwich. The    
 farm land remains in the hands of     
 local farmers, although often the     
 farmhouses and barns are the homes of 
 'newcomers'. As a parish, it has seen 
 a number of changes in the last 20    
 years - it shares it's vicar with     
 three other parishes for example - but
 it will no doubt survive.
