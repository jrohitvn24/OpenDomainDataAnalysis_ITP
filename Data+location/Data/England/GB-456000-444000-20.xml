		<title>20CLUBS_GIRL GUIDES</title>
		<content> Copmanthorpe has a Brownie pack,a     
 Guide pack and a Scout pack.I used to 
 be in Brownies and I started at the   
 age of seven and I went up to Guides  
 when I was 10 years old.This is a     
 typical evening at a guide meeting.   
 I get there for 7.15pm the Guides     
 start at 7.30pm. Then we are told to  
 get into a horse-shoe shape and we pay
 our subs which are Â£1 every six weeks.
 Next we have to get into our group    
 sixes where we can do what we want,for
 example,we might do some writing and  
 play games in our sixes like "Chinese 
 Whispers". At about 8.15pm we have a  
 game of something like "Snakes and    
 Ladders" or "Fishes" and then we have 
 a sing-song. At 9pm we have "Taps"    
 which is like a prayer which goes.... 
 Day's done,gone the sun from the sky, 
 from the hills. All is well, safely   
 rest,God is nigh.                     </content>
