		<title>17A Small Engineering Works</title>
		<content> We looked at local industry in our    
 area.To do this we visited a small    
 engineering works.                    
 Firstly we looked at the Hydrostatic  
 Release units these are used for      
 safety on yachts &amp; ships,this is there
 main product. In 1985 their main      
 product was 50% subcontract. They have
 a small wealding department with four 
 wealding machines. They also have a   
 small painting department which caters
 for all their uses. One of their      
 specialities is moulding plastic. It  
 goes into one end as plastic chips, it
 gets melted down and gets put into a  
 mould.They have around 40 people work 
 there and 50% live in our survey      
 area. They have one computerised      
 machine and one automatic machine.
