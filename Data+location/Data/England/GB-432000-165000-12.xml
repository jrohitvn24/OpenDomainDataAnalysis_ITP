 playing area, seats and Club house.   
 Financially the Club is dependant upon
 members subscriptions,vice-president  
 donations and bar profits. Matches are
 played from May until September       
 sometimes three times a week.weather  
 permitting. In July a floodlight match
 is played which is a great social     
 event with barbeques and fun until    
 midnight. Hungerford was the first    
 place to stage this event.            
                                       
 The football club is approx. 4 acres  
 with a playing pitch, a Club house,   
 with two bars,stand to seat 75 people 
 a covered standing area, floodlights. 
 As facilities are good,often other    
 clubs use the ground. There are five  
 hundren non-playing members and a     
 playing strength of 2O.
