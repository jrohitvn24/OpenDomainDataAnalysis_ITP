		<content>   The oldest houses are the stone     
 cottages clustered around Cheddleton  
 Church, many now converted from two   
 cottages into one modern home dating  
 from 1500 onwards.                    
   The largest house is Ashcombe Park, 
 built in the Georgian style. The      
 coming of the canal encouraged the    
 building of rows of cottages near the 
 flint mill, and at the Bottom of      
 Basford Bridge lane, for railway      
 workers at Lekbrook and Wall Grange,  
 also the avenue by Brittains Ltd. This
 century, large residential houses have
 been built at Cheddleton Heath and    
 along the Southern road out of        
 Cheddleton. Before and after the      
 2nd World War, council houses were    
 built near the hospital, Leekbrook,and
 along the Avenue. In the last 20      
 years,three large estates of modern   
 houses have been built.               </content>
