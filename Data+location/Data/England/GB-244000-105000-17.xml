		<title>17RIVER TORRIDGE</title>
		<content> The River Torridge flows half a mile  
 north of Black Torrington, from west  
 to east. It is crossed by Black       
 Torrington Bridge, built for carts and
 packhorses in medieval times, and by  
 Coham Bridge. The lush meadows of its 
 flood plain are one third of a mile   
 across, bounded by steep wooded slopes
 to the south and gentler rising       
 grassland to the north. The Torridge  
 has long been renowned as a salmon    
 fishery but recent catches have       
 dramatically declined, probably due to
 pollution. Corn was formerly ground at
 Kingsley Mill, close to Black         
 Torrington Bridge, and remains of     
 leats and weirs can be found. Otters  
 can very occasionally be seen, while  
 kingfishers, wagtails and a profusion 
 of wild flowers can be found along its
 banks. The river is too shallow to be 
 of any use for transport.             </content>
