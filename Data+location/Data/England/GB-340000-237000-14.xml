		<title>14HOBBIES AT THIRTEEN.</title>
		<content> My main hobbies are snooker, cycling, 
 collecting and I enjoy most outdoor   
 sports.                               
   In snooker you have to concentrate  
 but it can be relaxing.  If I get very
 good at it there is a lot of money in 
 the game.  I played the game at the   
 very early age of about six years,    
 where I had to stand on a box to play.
  I had a big advantage over other boys
 of my age because we had a snooker    
 table in our house so that my father, 
 a professional player could practise. 
   I like cycling because it keeps you 
 fit.  I have to go cycling every day  
 as I am in a team.  I have to ride 25 
 miles a day in an hour or less.  I    
 have a special bike which I only use  
 in races on a timed course, and I have
 a practise bike.
