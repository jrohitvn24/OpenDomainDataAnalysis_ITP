		<title>04The Harbour Bridlington</title>
		<content> Bridlington's Picuresque harbour is an
 important tourist attraction. In many 
 ways, the town focuses on it still,   
 and it is easily accessible from the  
 town centre. A great deal of          
 renovation and development has been   
 done lately in the surrounding area.  
 Trees have been planted and seats     
 installed. Modern shops have been set 
 in the north side and a pedestrian    
 bridge crosses the Gypsey race river  
 at Clough Hole. On the south pier     
 there is a large fish shed. All around
 the harbour are small gift shops and  
 sea food retailers. There is also a   
 harbour museum. Entry to the harbour  
 is difficult, a small sand bank called
 the Canch, in the harbour mouth causes
 problems .In the inner harbour is a   
 yacht marina and regattas are often   
 held. The steamers "Flambourian"      
 &amp;"Yorkshire Belle" operate from here. </content>
