		<content>   Some of the villagers we interviewed
 were concerned about the shopping     
 facilities in the village.They felt   
 that a national chain supermarket     
 would improve shopping facilities by  
 providing more choice and lowering    
 prices in general.However it must be  
 noted that others felt that people who
 had chosen to reside in the area      
 should accept the relative lack of    
 facilities compared with towns.       
   Some of the villagers were annoyed  
 by the chemical spraying of crops last
 year.Apparently this caused the death 
 of a number of birds.                 
   Villagers expressed concern about   
 speeding vehicles on the main road.   
   The lack of bus services was a      
 grievance aired by some of the        
 villagers.                            
                                       
                                       </content>
