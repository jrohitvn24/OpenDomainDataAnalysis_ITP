		<title>18TRAVELLING FROM OAKAMOOR</title>
		<content>There are only four bus journeys a day 
between Cheadle,Oakamoor and Uttoxeter 
(none on Sundays) and it costs 376p    
return for a family of four to travel  
between Oakamoor and Cheadle.Not many  
people travel on the buses.There are no
buses after 5pm so you can only go out 
in the evening if you can walk the 3.5 
miles home, beg a lift or have a car.  
Most of the people who don't have a car
are children,teenagers, housewives and 
elderly people.                        
 It is lovely to live in the village if
you have a car. Then you can enjoy the 
countryside, but still travel to work, 
the shops and entertainment.The number 
of families with cars is increasing.In 
1981,129 households had one car(115 in 
1971) and 51 had two cars (34 in 1971).
 63 households have no car at all      
(87 in 1971).
