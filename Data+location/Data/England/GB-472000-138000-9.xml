		<title>09Lord Mayor Treloar College</title>
		<content>   { Lord Mayor Treloar College,}      
 in Holybourne, was founded in 1908 by 
 Sir William{Treloar. }It was built as 
 a small boys' school, but has since   
 grown rapidly.  It had two houses     
 called pink corridor and blue         
 corridor, but they were both for boys.
     In 1967 it was changed into a     
 girls' and boys' school, and then the 
 pink corridor was for girls and the   
 blue for boys, but then so many       
 children wanted to go to Treloars that
 they had to build more houses, so pink
 corridor and blue corridor went out of
 use.  There has just been another     
 house built called Gloucester House,  
 which was named after the{Duchess of  
{Gloucester}who}came to open it.  The  
 other houses are named after          
 benefactors of the college : Evans,   
 Gavain and Allan.
