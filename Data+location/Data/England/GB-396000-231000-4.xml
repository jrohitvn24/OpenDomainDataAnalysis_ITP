		<content>  School and work fill most of five    
 days of the week,but a two day weekend
 leaves times for hobbies and non-work 
 activities.Gardening is a high        
 priority for the villagers.Cricket is 
 popular in the summer months;a few    
 homes have private swimming pools and 
 tennis courts,but the nearest public  
 ones are in Tewkesbury.Other hobbies  
 include:                              
  Scottish country dancing.Gliding     
  Sailing.                 Snooker     
  Horse riding.            Book binding
  Evening classes during winter months 
  run by Gloucester LEA.               
  Cheltenham and Stratford are the     
 nearest towns to provide theatres,    
 cinemas and museums. The mobile       
 library visits every second week.     
 Families usually eat only the evening 
 meal together which is prepared by    
 mother with help from children.       </content>
