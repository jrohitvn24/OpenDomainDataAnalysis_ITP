		<content> The dunes at Eskmeals cover an area of
 125 acres and are managed as a nature 
 reserve by the Cumbria Trust for      
 Nature Conservation.They constitute   
 one of the few remaining unspoiled    
 sand dune systems in Britain. Visitors
 are welcome but are encouraged to keep
 away from certain areas during nesting
 time.Birds breeding there include     
 Black-headed Gull and Oyster-Catcher. 
 Pools have been built to encourage the
 breeding of Natterjack Toads - a      
 threatened species-also known as the  
 "Singing Toad". Plants found include  
 Adder's Tongue, Royal Fern and several
 species of orchid. The dunes are      
 "managed" by careful control of       
 invasive plants such as Rose-bay      
 Willow-herb and by planting of Marram 
 grass to encourage dune stabilisation.
