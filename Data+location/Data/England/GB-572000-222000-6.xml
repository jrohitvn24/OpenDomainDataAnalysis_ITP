		<title>06Shopping in Braintree</title>
		<content>    During our investigations we tried 
 to establish people's opinions on     
 Braintree and Bocking as a shopping   
 centre. Many years ago this was a     
 prosperous area but with easy         
 transport links with both Chelmsford  
 and Colchester we wished to know how  
 the public attitude had changed.      
    On questioning members of the      
 public we found most people are       
 generally satisfied with our town     
 although certain members felt it could
 be improved by making the whole centre
 a pedestrian precinct rather than just
 Bank Street. This point may come after
 the construction of the Braintree     
 Bypass. Our investigations also       
 revealed a need for a larger range of 
 chain stores and Hypermarkets than    
 those already present. To balance this
 argument one local shopkeeper thought 
 the town should stay the same.        </content>
