		<title>17CATON  GALA</title>
		<content>The Caton Gala was first opened in 1939
by the Gala committee. The chairman was
H.Muncaster. The Gala was advertised in
many local newspapers. In the early    
Gala they had trotting and horse racing
and musical chairs on horseback. After 
the Gala they had the annual dance.    
  The Caton Gala was revived in 1984   
and was opened by a local M.P. Mark    
Lennox-Boyd. In 1985 the Gala was      
opened by Fred Dibnah, a famous        
steeplejack. The parade marched down   
Brookhouse Road to Caton with about 7  
floats carrying people in fancy dress. 
The Lunesdale Pipers were playing as   
the  parade arrived at the cricket     
field at Caton. They had games to play 
like coconut shy and pick a key to win 
a #1 note. There were races, stalls and
Morris dancers and a fire eater        
entertained the crowds. The whole      
village enjoys this exciting event.    </content>
