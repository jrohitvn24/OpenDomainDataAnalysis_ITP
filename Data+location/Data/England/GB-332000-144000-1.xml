 field, East Huntspill C.P. school,    
 some private houses and the methodist

 the Crown Stores on the right council 
 houses on the left and then the Crown

 Church. But if you come in from the   
 north you will see some farms,the     
 Bason Bridge Inn the Post Office,     
 Garage, a hardware shop and the Milk  
 Marketing Board factory. The factory  
 is the largest building in the village
 By the factory the road crosses the   
 River Brue. The landscape all around  
 the village is rough, grazing land for
 cows and sheep.It is very flat,the    
 only hills being the bridges over the 
 nearby M5 motorway and Exeter-Bristol 
 railway line.                         </content>
