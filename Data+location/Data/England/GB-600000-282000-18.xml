		<title>18Building Trade, N. Lopham</title>
		<content>      There are several builders in the
 village.  One of them was interviewed 
 for the Domesday survey.  He has been 
 in the building trade for 23 years and
 has lived for almost all that time in 
 North Lopham.  He employs 10 men.  He 
 has put up about 19 houses in North   
 Lopham, but he also travels within a  
 25 mile radius to work in other       
 villages.  Apart from houses, he has  
 built extensions, offices, factory    
 units, farm units and has renovated   
 barns.  This builder also owns and    
 runs the Newsagent/Stores in the      
 village.                              
      A second builder employs 2 men   
 full time and works within about a    
 25 mile radius of the village, putting
 up all types of buildings.            
      A third builder now runs a       
 one-man business, specializing in     
 houses and agricultural buildings.    </content>
