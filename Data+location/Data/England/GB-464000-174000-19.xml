		<content> In my spare time at school I played{  
{"Flying Hedgehogs."}Tim was trying to 
 catch us.We caught him in a powerful  
 chamber and we turned him into a{     
{Flying Hedgehog.}But he turned back   
 and he kept catching us.We kept       
 escaping and {Katherine}was the leader
 and she had the most powers and Tim   
 was trying to find where our powers   
 were kept.We soon found out so we     
 tried to kill him but we could not.

{"Stuck in the mud"}is a running       
 game.There is a child who is on and if
 that child catches another child,that 
 child stands with his hands out,and a 
 girl or boy goes under that girl or   
 boys arm and they start running again.
 The last person who gets hit is on.
