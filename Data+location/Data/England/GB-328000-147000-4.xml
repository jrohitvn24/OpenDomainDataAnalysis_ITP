		<title>04RUNNING A TEA-SHOP</title>
		<content>                                       
  There are many tea-shops in          
 Burnham-on-Sea because it is a seaside
 town. On the sea front there is the   
 Old Customs House which used to be    
 used by the customs officer in the    
 days when Burnham was a thriving port.
 Nowadays it is open to the public for 
 refreshments during the season.       
                                       
  On fine days it is open from early   
 morning until 10.30 pm for anything   
 from a cup of tea to a three course   
 meal, and on less fine days they stay 
 open until it is obvious there will be
 no more customers.                    
                                       
  It is a very busy life running a     
 tea-shop, especially as the customer  
 is always right, but they all enjoy   
 the work, and most of their customers 
 are pleasant and friendly.            </content>
