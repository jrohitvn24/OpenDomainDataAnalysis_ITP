		<content> Horsham has grown very much since the 
 1920's when Mr. Cramp was a boy. The  
 population having grown nearly to     
 26000. The family jewellery business  
 was started by his grandfather in     
 1872. It was originaly near the Town  
 Hall, then it moved to Middle St. and 
 then to West St. in 1878. Then, only  
 about three jewellers were in Horsham.
 Nowadays there is fierce competition  
 with 7 other businesses. His favourite
 parts of Horsham are the Causeway and 
 Denne Hill. He also likes the hustle  
 and bustle of Horsham Station. He     
 believes that Horsham has developed   
 over the years and this can only bring
 prosperity to the town. If office     
 blocks merge into the surroundings    
 then the character of Horsham will not
 change drastically.
