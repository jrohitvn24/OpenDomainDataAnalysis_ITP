		<title>01GENERAL VIEW OF UPWEY</title>
		<content>{UPWEY}IS LOCATED JUST TO THE NORTH OF 
 WEYMOUTH WHICH IS SOUTH DORSET'S      
 PREMIER RESORT TOWN.                  
 THE MAIN ROADWAY THROUGH THE AREA     
 LEADS FROM WEYMOUTH TO DORCHESTER AND 
 IT FORMS THE FOCUS OF MOST OF THE     
 URBAN ACTIVITY.                       
 THE BULK OF THE BLOCK IS TAKEN UP WITH
{AGRICULTURAL ACTIVITES}OF ONE KIND OR 
 ANOTHER, AND THE WHOLE AREA IS BEST   
 DESCRIBED AS "RURAL".                 
 THE VILLAGE ITSELF CONTAINS SEVERAL   
 FEATURES OF NOTE SUCH AS THE{WISHING }
{WELL}ON THE SMALL RIVER WEY THE       
 OLD MANOR AT{WESTBROOK HOUSE}AND THE  
 FLOUR{MILL}WHICH IN FACT FEATURED IN  
 ONE OF{THOMAS HARDY'S NOVELS.}        
 THERE IS LITTLE IN THE WAY OF SHOPPING
 OR ENTERTAINMENT FACILITIES, AND MOST 
 OF THE LOCAL PEOPLE WORK OUTSIDE THE  
 VILLAGE IN WEYMOUTH OR DORCHESTER.
