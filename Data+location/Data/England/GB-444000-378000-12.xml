		<title>12St.Giles School Sports Day</title>
		<content> On Tuesday 16th of July we had a      
 sports day.It was the first big sports
 day on our school field.Some of the   
 events were three legged race,walking 
 race,relay,obstacle,skipping and      
 sprint.You got badges if you won,     
 came 2nd or even 3rd.St. Giles school 
 made their own badges.The three legged
 race is where your leg is tied to     
 somebody elses leg and you run as fast
 as you can.We have house colours so   
 the judge knows who to give the points
 to.If you are in green for example    
 you try to wear a green T-shirt and   
 shorts don't really matter.We had     
 lines to run between which Mr Dumville
 marked out in the morning.We had great
 fun at sports day especially when the 
 parents had a race.At the end the     
 Paddy Edwards trophy was presented to 
 the blue team.Paddy Edwards had been a
 keen local sportsman for many years.  </content>
