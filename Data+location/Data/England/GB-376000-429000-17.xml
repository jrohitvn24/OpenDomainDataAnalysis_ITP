		<title>17THE CHRISTMAS PARTY</title>
		<content> At Christmas,I was asked to organise a
{Christmas}party.First of all,I set up 
 a committee of 5 people who would help
 with games, food and records.Most     
 people brought money which we kept in 
 a glass jar.The food was bought in    
 Accrington by the girls.The boys      
 helped with the{record player}and     
 decorated the classroom.The day       
 arrived and we were busy all morning  
 getting the food ready.We made        
{jellies,sandwiches,cakes}and got the  
 drinks sorted out.By dinner time it   
 was ready.In the afternoon the party  
 began.Games were played and prizes    
 given.About 2.20pm.we ate and by the  
 time we had finished,it was           
 2.40pm.Then we cleared up and danced  
 until 3.00.When it had finished,I sat 
 down with a special feeling of        
 satisfaction.It was the best party I  
 had been to.  By Debbie Richardson.   </content>
