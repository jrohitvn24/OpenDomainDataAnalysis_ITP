   The owner of the Off-Licence also   
owns a bigger one in Sevenoaks. He     
imports wine from Spain, France, Italy,
and Germany. The shop is open from     
10.30am. to 6.00pm, but is shut on     
Saturday and Wednesday afternoons. The 
owner and another person work in the   
shop.                                  
   Alcohol is only sold to people who  
are 18 and over. The shop sells crisps,
nuts, squash and tobacco, as well as   
all kinds of alcohol. We counted 175   
wines, 35 beers, 14 sherries and 79    
spirits. Most customers buy drink in   
the morning. Glasses are loaned when   
drinks are loaned for parties, etc.    
White wine is sold in the greatest     
quantities. Customers buy for parties  
and weddings as well as for drinking at
home.                                  
                                       </content>
