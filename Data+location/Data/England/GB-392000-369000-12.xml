		<title>12Games We Play</title>
		<content> At playtimes, one of our favourite    
 games is 'Blockey Off'.One person     
 counts to 50 while all the others     
 hide.If they reach the post before    
 they are seen by the counter,they get 
 to hide again. If they are seen it is 
 their turn to count.The counter calls 
 1,2,3'Blockey Off You 'when you are   
 seen. We also play 'tick a nick' which
 is a chasing game.We have several     
 bases in our playground you have got  
 to run from one base to the other     
 without being ticked by the person who
 is on. If you are ticked you join the 
 ticker until everyone is caught.      
 Sometimes we play charades.When it is 
 wet we can play draughts and chess in 
 the classroom at playtimes.We play    
 lots of games in our games lessons.   
 These include netball,shinty,football,
 touch rugby and skittleball in groups 
 of mixed boys and girls.              </content>
