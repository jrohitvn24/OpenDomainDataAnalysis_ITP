		<content> At Sminhays there are the remains of  
 the old mining cottages. On one side  
 of the road they have all but         
 disappeared, only the foundations     
 remaining but on the west side of the 
 road they have been renovated and now 
 provide the home for Brendon Hill     
 Crafts.                               
 Brendon Hill Crafts is a family       
 business run by a husband and wife, he
 is an artist and she makes and        
 sells preserves, fudge and other home 
 made sweets. They also sell honey     
 which is made by a friend.            
 There are three terraced cottages     
 here, one is lived in by the artist   
 and his wife, the centre cottage is   
 used as a studio and the third is used
 as a holiday cottage and only occupied
 at weekends and at times in the       
 summer.
