		<content> The Motorway is called the M69. It    
 comes from Coventry and it goes to    
 Leicester It is short because it links
 the M1 with the M6. It goes under 13  
 bridges from Coventry to Leicester,6  
 of which are in this area.The Motorway
 cuts accccross the area dividing it   
 into a quarter in the east and three  
 quarters in the west, and it travels  
 from north - east to south. The       
 Motorway has caused problems for      
 farmers in getting machinery across it
 because they have land on both sides. 
 Tunnels have been built under the     
 motorway to try to solve this problem.
 On the day of our survvey the traffic 
 wasn't excessive. Over half the       
 vehicles were carsss, and             
 approximately two fifths were lorries 
 and vans. More traffic was going from 
 Coventry to Leicester than the other  
 way.                                  </content>
