		<content> In Stoke Hammond children play        
 different games.Some are{Three Bad    
{Eggs,Polo,Bulldog}and others.{Polo}is 
 played with as many people as you want
 in the group.One person is it and that
 person calls out a subject.If it was  
 trees then the other people would each
 choose a tree.Somebody would call them
 out and the person who is it would    
 pick one.That person and the one who  
 is it both run to the opposite side   
 and back.As they reach the end they   
 shout Polo and whoever gets there     
 first would be it for the next game.  
 Another game is{Bulldog.}There is a   
 group of people at one end of the hall
 and one person in the middle.That     
 person would call someones name.That  
 person would run to the other end and 
 try not to be caught.Then when that   
 person reaches the end they shout     
 Bulldog and the others run as well.   </content>
