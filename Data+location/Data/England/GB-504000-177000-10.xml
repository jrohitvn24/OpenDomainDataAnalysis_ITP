		<title>10HOTELS</title>
		<content> We are very near Heathrow Airport     
 and 2 of the larger hotels are in our 
 area. We visited one, The Holiday Inn,
 and were shown around and then taken  
 to a conferance room to interview the 
 Personel Manager. She was very helpful
 and answered all our questions and    
 gave us drinks and biscuits.          
 The Holiday Inn belongs to the largest
 accommodation system in the world. It 
 offers free parking, swimming pool,   
 sauna,well appointed rooms with large 
 comfortable beds,colour television and
 private bathrooms and many other      
 things for guests. We saw a menue, it 
 was full of delicious things. At the  
 reception desk we saw a tariff and it 
 cost Â£48.OO for one night.            
 The hotel also employs many people.   
 They train, clothe and feed their     
 employees while on duty. The wages are
 good with a bonus and a free holiday. </content>
