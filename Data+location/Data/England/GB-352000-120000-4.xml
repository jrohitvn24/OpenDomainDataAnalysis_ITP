		<title>04Pig Farming</title>
		<content>  My father is a{farmer.}He often works
 with{pigs.}He has to go to work at    
 7.30 in the morning. When he gets to  
 the farm he starts to{clean the pigs  
 out. This will take him up to four    
 hours to complete satisfactorily. He  
 would then have a break and drink a   
 cup of well deserved coffee.          
   After the break he would start to   
{feed the pigs}and at one o' clock he  
 would stop to have his own dinner.    
 Then he would finish feeding the pigs.
 The pigs are fed{on a swill}made out  
 of barley and water.                  
   When all the pigs are fed, my       
 father would do odd jobs like{clipping
{the young pigs'teeth}so that they do  
 not get too sharp, or moving some     
 pigs to another pen.                  
   He would then come home for tea at  
 about five o'clock.
