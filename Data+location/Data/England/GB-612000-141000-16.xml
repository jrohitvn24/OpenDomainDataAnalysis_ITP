		<title>16My Granny</title>
		<content> My name is Paul Woodbridge. My Granny 
 lives next door to me. She lives in a 
 very old house. When my Mum goes to   
 work my Granny looks after me. My     
 Granny makes great toad in the hole.  
 She is always in the garden planting  
 flowers. My Granny goes to church     
 every Sunday, and Saturday she goes   
 shopping. Sometimes my Granny buys me 
 sweets. She has got a lovely garden   
 full of flowers. Once she took my     
 brother and me to a play, it was about
 Robinson Crusoe, it was very good. We 
 bought some raffle tivkets but we did 
 not win.                              
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
