		<title>05MOOR HALL, NE Sutton C'field</title>
		<content>Moor Hall Mansion is an imposing       
building. It is now the centre of Moor 
Hall Golf Club, opened in 1932, which  
lies in park land in the SW corner of  
the block. It includes a golf shop and 
a licensed hotel and restaurant. The   
eighteen hole links are most           
attractive. One section of trees is    
still known to some children as the    
"Haunted Wood". Membership of this club
is ardently sought after by local      
golfers.                               
The mansion itself was built, as his   
home, by Bishop Vesey who got the land 
from the King in 1527. Bishop Vesey    
then looked kindly on his old home of  
Sutton encouraging markets and         
prosperity. The octagonally shaped     
Tudor cottage standing near Moor Hall  
also dates from those times.
