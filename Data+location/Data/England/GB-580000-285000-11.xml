		<title>11WORSHIP IN SANTON DOWNHAM</title>
		<content> There are 2 churches in the area,     
 both are C. of E. and both come under 
 Brandon for administration. The larger
 at Santon Downham is recorded in the  
 original Domesday Survey of 1089 AD   
 and parts of the existing building    
 could pre_date that record. It is of  
 complicated architecture which has    
 been well researched by John Fitch    
 MA, sometime rector, in a book on sale
 in the church. This book also has     
 notes about the church at Santon. At  
 St. Mary the Virgin, family service is
 held every Sunday at 1015 but without 
 Communion on the 1st and 3rd Sundays. 
 Both churches merit a visit by        
 historians and architects for         
 information beyond the scope of this  
 survey.
