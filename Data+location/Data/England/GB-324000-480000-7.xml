		<title>07THE COMMUNITY POLICE.</title>
		<content>     Mr. Derek Robinson is our         
 community policeman.The first thing   
 that he has to do is to tell the      
 police station that he is starting    
 work. He's got this little radio and  
 that's how he tells them.             
     Mr. Robinson works eight hours a  
 day going round our estate. At night  
 he goes to the Post Office, to Urswick
 Road Stores, to the Co-op and the     
 Swimming Baths to make sure everything
 is locked up safely.One day he saw    
 some boys glue sniffing behind the    
 Urswick Road Stores.                  
     Our other community policeman is  
 Mr.McClelland. They tell people off   
 for playing on the road or riding a   
 bike at night without lights. They try
 to keep our estate peaceful and happy.
