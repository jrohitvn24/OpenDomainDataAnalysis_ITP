		<content>  I moved to Blennerhasset during the  
 past year. I live in a house called   
 Peare Tree House. It was built in     
 1686, so next year it will be three   
 hundred years old. I like living here 
 because there is a shop across the    
 road. The school is over the road too.
 There are lots of things happening in 
 the village,  like a Sports Day and an
 annual fancy dress parade. Lots of    
 mobile shops visit the village, the   
 mobile library and an ice-cream van   
 too.                                  
  The main disadvantage of living here 
 is that the buses don't run very      
 frequently, only two a day, so it is  
 difficult for old people and those    
 without cars, to go shopping; and for 
 young people to go the the swimming   
 baths, night classes and clubs.
