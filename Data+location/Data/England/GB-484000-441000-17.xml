		<content>      The Market Weighton and          
 Shiptonthorpe area, like the rest of  
 Britain, is served well by the BBC and
 Independent local radio.  The most    
 popular stations are "Radio One",     
 "Radio Humberside" and "Viking Radio".
 Television proves the most popular    
 media source for most people, most    
 homes having at least 1 T.V.          
      The local papers are the         
 "Pocklington Times", "The Hull Daily  
 Mail", "The Evening Press" and the    
 "Yorkshire Post", as well as the      
 national papers.  Papers are          
 distributed by the newsagents of      
 Market Weighton using young delivery  
 persons.  As for media coverage the   
 area is very quiet and so does not    
 merit even a permanent local paper    
 reporter.
