 On our farm (67% arable,23% grazing)  
 the main crops are wheat,oilseed rape 
 and barley.The main animals are sheep 
 (1000 ewes) and cattle (280 calves    
 for fattening each year).We have to   
 make silage in the summer as stock for
 the cattle to eat in winter.Silage is 
 made by putting hay into plastic bags 
 and leaving it for a while.Then it    
 turns into green hay which is known as
 silage.In the lambing time when the   
 sheep have lambs someone has to go out
 in the night to see if any lambs have 
 been born.If we did not a lamb might  
 die because the afterbirth might cover
 the lamb's face which would stop it   
 breathing.Shearing takes place in     
 summer,when the sheep's wool is taken 
 off because it is too hot.The woollen 
 fleeces are taken away to be sold.
