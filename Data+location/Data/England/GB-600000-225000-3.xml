		<title>03The Highwoods Development.</title>
		<content> There are lots of different kinds of  
 new houses and many companies building
 them.These include Tarmac, Brosely,   
 Barrat, and French-Kier.The whole     
 development will take 6 years to      
 complete.A new primary school is      
 expected to be built for the children 
 who move there.Colchester Borough     
 Council have set up a country park to 
 be included in  Highwoods .It will    
 contain a picnic area,a golf course,  
 foot- and cycle-paths,and a caravan   
 and camping site.                     
 A major feature of the development is 
 Tesco's Hypermarket.It is already well
 established but work has begun on     
 enlarging and improving the facilities
 there. The nearby petrol station,which
 sells cut-price products,and the large
 car-park encourage people to come from
 a very wide area.
