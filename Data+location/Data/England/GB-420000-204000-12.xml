		<title>12RELIGION: FILKINS/EASTLEACH</title>
		<content>Christianity appears to be the only re-
ligion practised. The Anglican Church  
of St Peter is one of five in the      
Broadshire Group of parishes, adminis- 
tered by one vicar, with services held 
in each church in rotation. Most villa-
gers are baptised and married in church
but funeral services are now often fol-
lowed by cremation. There are 40 resi- 
dents on the church electoral roll. The
Methodist Chapel with 15 members, holds
one service every Sunday, taken either 
by a minister from Carterton  or by lay
preachers;  marriage, baptism &amp; funeral
services are also held.  Both Church &amp; 
Chapel support missionary work in Afri-
ca and elsewhere. There are 3 Quakers &amp;
a small number of Roman Catholics in   
Filkins. The vicar of St Andrew's      
Church in Eastleach is also responsible
for five parishes; the number of       
regular attenders there is 45.         </content>
