		<content> SUMMARY OF THE WHOLE 12 KM SQUARE     
                                       
        The majority of the squares    
 are covered by housing estates.       
 These are served by one large         
 shopping precinct and 'village' shops 
                                       
        The north-west corner is part  
 of the Downs and stands out as being  
 totally different.                    
                                       
        There were many amenities in   
 the area that were not listed in the  
 amenities count but that we thought   
 were important.  For example there    
 were abundant GLASSHOUSES             
               VIDEO SHOPS             
               CHEMISTS
