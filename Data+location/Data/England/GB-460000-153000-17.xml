		<title>17St. Andrews Church</title>
		<content> The early history of St.Andrews, the  
 parish church of Sherborne St. John is
 not clear.  It is thought a church was
 built on the site about 1150 and the  
 south and west walls, the south door  
 of the nave and the font remain from  
 this date.  The church is built of    
 flint and stone with a brick chapel,  
 porch and vestry.  The tower was first
 built in 1250 and contains six bells, 
 the two oldest cast in 1587. The      
 chancel was added in 1300, and in 1420
 the Brocas Chapel was built as a      
 family mausoleum. The sanctuary is a  
 memorial to one Richard Attkins.  The 
 south porch was built in 1533.  The   
 fine pulpit dated 1634 is unusual as  
 it is signed by its maker.  The north 
 aisle was built in 1854 to provide    
 work for the parish. The lychgate was 
 built to celebrate Queen Victoria's   
 Golden Jubilee.                       </content>
