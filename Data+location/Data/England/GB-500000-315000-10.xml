		<title>10HEDGEROWS AND FIELD NAMES</title>
		<content> About 7\ kilometres of hedgerow have  
 disappeared from our block compared   
 with the 1950 maps, and possibly many 
 more have gone that we did not notice.
  Valuable habitats have gone, but that
 isn't the only loss. We asked farmers 
 whether their fields have names. Most 
 have names like{20 acre}or{22 acre.   
 Interesting old names just disappear  
 as fields are amalgamated.            
{ Pingles, Cold Oates}and{Great Ground 
 seem to be very old names.{Danes Hill}
 is on high ground: it is thought the  
 Saxons used it as a lookout for Danes.
{Poison Field}is where dead cattle were
 buried in quicklime after an outbreak 
 of anthrax.{Hovel Field}has an old    
 cattle shed or "hovel" in it.{Laud's  
{Meadow}may get its name because it is 
 very fertile and worthy of praise.    
 Bombs fell in{Bomb Holes}during the   
 war.{Conservation}has an SSSI in it!  </content>
