		<title>07MONEY TALK SURVEY</title>
		<content> My friend and I did a survey about    
 money.The first question we asked the 
 public was,"do you like the pound     
 coins rather than the pound notes?"We 
 found that twice as many people said  
 they thought the pound coins weren't  
 popular.Some people had to think quite
 a while before they answered.When we  
 asked people "are you glad the        
 halfpenny's gone,"all 20 people       
 said,"yes".We think they said this    
 because the coins were fiddly and they
 got caught in ladies' purses.         
   The next question was,"do you think 
 you can lose a pound coin easier than 
 a pound note?"Again, most people      
 said,"yes", even though you can hear  
 them drop.                            
   The last question was,"do you like  
 the 20 pence pieces?" Most people said
 they did. We think so too.
