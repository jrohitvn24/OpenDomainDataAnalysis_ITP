		<content> In Chew Magna there are two Brownie   
 packs.  One meets on Mondays and the  
 other on Wednesdays.  11 girls from   
 the Primary School go on Wednesdays   
 from 6.30-8.00 p.m. You can be        
 enrolled as a Brownie at age 7 when   
 you are given a promise badge.You     
 are also given a certificate, a county
 badge,a pack name badge and a Six     
 emblem.You have to know your Brownie  
 promise and the Brownie law. At       
 Brownies we make presents for Mother's
 Day, Father's Day, Christmas and      
 Easter. In the summer we go to the    
 field to pick flowers or play         
 rounders. We also play games such as  
 Captain's Coming,Ladders and Cat and  
 Mouse. We have been to Brownie Camp   
 and have also taken part in the 75th  
 Girl Guides' anniversary pageant in   
 Bath.
