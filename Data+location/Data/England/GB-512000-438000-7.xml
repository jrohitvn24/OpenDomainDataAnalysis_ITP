 Most people in the village travel     
 into Hull to shop for items such as   
 clothing and furniture and some also  
 buy their food there. Most people     
 visit a large supermarket about four  
 miles away for their general          
 provisions.                           
 Many of the large stores in Hull      
 operate a delivery service for larger 
 items and there is a regular bus      
 service into the city.                
 A few people visit the smaller towns  
 of Beverley and Hornsea to shop and   
 some travel as far as York and        
 Sheffield and Leeds for specialist    
 items.
