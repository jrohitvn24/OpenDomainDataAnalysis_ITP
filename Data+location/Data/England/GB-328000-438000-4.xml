		<content>{A Tragic Sea-side Accident}           
 Blackpool's coastline has seen many   
 tragedies, one of the most senseless  
 being that of January 5th 1983, when a
 holidaymaker drowned while trying to  
 save his dog from the rough sea. Three
 police officers who tried to save him 
 were also drowned.                    
 The bodies of the four people were    
 later recovered some distance from the
 scene of the drowning, near Gynn      
 Square,where a memorial has been      
 erected.                              
 Holidaymakers are often warned that   
 when the sea is rough at high tide it 
 is very dangerous to go into the water
 in some places along the coast, but   
 people find this hard to believe and  
 often disregard safety warnings, even 
 though chains and safety barriers are 
 put up.
