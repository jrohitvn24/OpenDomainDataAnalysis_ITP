		<title>09Farming near E. Hagbourne</title>
		<content>There are many farms in the area, most 
are arable with some mixed or fruit    
farms. Most dairying takes place on the
drained marshland round Hacca Brook.   
Near the settlements, fruit farms are  
found eg J W Corderoy at Hagbourne Mill
Farm, East Hagbourne, operates a PYO   
and ready picked system and grows a    
variety of produce- strawberries,      
raspberries, asparagus and flowers.    
Some of the farming land is used for   
rearing horses and there are racing    
stables at Aston Upthorpe together     
with a stud farm.                      
Upthorpe Farm is 500 acres with a      
cropping acreage of 250. There are 5   
full time staff and 3 part timers. It  
is an arable and dairy farm producing  
milk and wheat/barley. Fertilisers used
include Â£slyde' and Â£raddar' for arable
crops and Â£chafer' and Â£nitram' on the 
grassland.                             </content>
