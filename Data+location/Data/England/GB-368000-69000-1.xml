		<title>01Overview of Study Area</title>
		<content> The study area consists of the        
 southern half of the Island of        
 Portland in Dorset.  The Island is in 
 fact a peninsula connected to the     
 mainland at its northern end by the   
 magnificent bank of shingle known as  
 Chesil Beach. The total population of 
 the Isle of Portland is in the region 
 of 15,000 of which about 10,000 live  
 in the three main settlements covered 
 by this study i.e. the villages of    
 Easton, Weston and Southwell. Large   
 areas of the Island have been opened  
 up by the quarrying industry          
 extracting Portland limestone for     
 local use and for sale elsewhere.     
 This stone has been used in the       
 construction of several important     
 buildings in London.  Other industries
 on the Island relate to fishing, the  
 Navy and Ministry of Defence          
 establishments.                       </content>
