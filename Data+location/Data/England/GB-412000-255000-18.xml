		<content> As we know there are no factories in  
 Haselor we were interested to know how
 far people travelled to work.We asked 
 on the survey:                        
 How many work                         
     a)within 02 miles of home         
     b)between 02 and 05 miles         
     c)between 05 and 10 miles         
     d)over 10 miles                   
 Here are the results:                 
     a)00 to 02miles   *  06  *        
     b)02 to 05miles   *  05  *        
     c)05 to 10miles   *  06  *        
     d)over 10 miles   *  12  *        
 We realised that most people had to   
 travel to work. The only work we could
 think of that was done in the village 
 was farm work and dinner ladies at the
 school, with some ladies doing        
 cleaning jobs in some of the larger   
 houses.
