		<title>16ARABLE FARMING</title>
		<content>Land to the west of Stanford is a light
sandy gravel which makes it easier to  
plough and grow  crops. Most farms grow
winter corn as the land is easier to   
work before the wet winter weather     
sets in. More efficient production is  
due to the use of artificial           
fertilizers, pesticides, fungicides and
herbicides. Over production of corn    
results in selling to E.E.C.           
"intervention" and consequent storage  
as grain mountains. Grain is gathered  
by combine harvesters, artificially    
dried in corn dryers and stored on the 
farm until collection. Some is sold    
for breakfast cereals, beer-making,    
bread and animal feed. Oats and beans  
are used for feedstuff on the farm.    
Maize is fed green, either as silage   
or chopped. Some barley straw is used  
for animal feed, some wheat straw for  
bedding, but most is burnt in fields.  </content>
