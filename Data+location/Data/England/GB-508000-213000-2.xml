		<content>    The area lies on the south-facing  
 dip slope of the Chiltern Hills and in
 the valley of the River Ver.  It      
 ranges in height between 315 feet in  
 the south and 499 feet in the         
 north-east.                           
    The valley of the Ver is virtually 
 dry in this section due mainly to the 
 large amounts of water which have been
 extracted from the chalk acquifer for 
 example at the Friars Wash pumping    
 station.  Water is now only found in  
 the dried up bed in times of heavy    
 rainfall or locally as small, marshy  
 areas.                                
    The gradient of the valley side is 
 gentle, averaging 1:33 and the        
 landscape could best be described as  
 gently rolling countryside.
