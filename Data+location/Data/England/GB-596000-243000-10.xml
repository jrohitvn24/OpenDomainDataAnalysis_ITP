		<title>10FARMING EMPLOYMENT HOUSING</title>
		<content>Many previous farmhouses and their     
associated buildings are now empty;    
the land having been incorporated into 
larger farms.  Some of the buildings   
have been sold though tythe cottages   
tend to be derelict.  Economics and    
cost efficiency are the watchwords.    
The work is mechanised and many fewer  
men are employed.  Some of the original
workers still live in the area but     
commute to nearby towns where          
unemployment is high.  New technical   
and chemical handling skills are       
required for weed, pest and disease    
control, as well as to encourage growth
and yield.  New strains of seed are    
used to maximise desirable features and
eradicate previous plant weaknesses.
