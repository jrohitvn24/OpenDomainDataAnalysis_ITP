		<content>    The sporting rights of Parsons     
 Park, Dentonside Wood and Ninegills   
 are all let to tenants for shooting   
 and roe deer stalking.                
    Parsons Park and Ninegills are very
 thick and afford roe deer stalking and
 pigeon shooting.                      
    Dentonside, much of which was re-  
 planted in 1978, is run as a syndicate
 pheasant shoot.  Wild pheasants are   
 encouraged by providing dusting       
 shelters, ample feed and control of   
 mink, stoats and weasels.  These are  
 supplemented each year by the release 
 of six week old poults in early August
    Shooting is organised on six days  
 during November, December and January.
    The countryside is ideal for those 
 who seek their leisure and relaxation 
 in walking.  The views are magnificent
 and varied and access is easy by      
 rights of way and tolerant landowners.</content>
