		<title>20SPORTS IN FYLINGDALES</title>
		<content> fishing is mainly for sport with a rod
 and line. Some people go out in the   
 boats and others fish off the sea wall
 and rocks. The fishermen use large    
 rods called casters, or small thick   
 rods with which they are more likely  
 to catch bigger fish. Artificial baits
 such as rubber squids and eels are    
 used together with feathers and live  
 baits such as crab, ragworm and       
 lugworm. Robin Hoods Bay is famous for
 its fried fish and chips.             
 Because Robin Hoods Bay and           
 Fylingthorpe are such small villages, 
 many sports are not played. For       
 instance we do not have a rugby team. 
 The nearest swimming baths are in     
 Whitby. The nearest sports centre is  
 in Billingham, Teesside. Despite this 
 Fylingdales is still a sporting area  
 and will continue to be one for many, 
 many years.                           </content>
