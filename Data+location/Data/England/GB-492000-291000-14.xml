		<content> " Life in Deene starts early.Our      
cowman arrives from Corby at 5am.He    
fetches the cows from the field.If it  
is mushroom time he's likely to meet   
one of the Barratt family collecting   
their  breakfast.                      
The remaining men who work at Home Farm
or on the Deene Estate start work at   
8am.This is a busy time in the main    
street with tractors and implements    
travelling to their work.Between 8am &amp; 
9am cars come through the village on   
their way to the new Industrial Estate 
in Corby.                              
Mornings and afternoons are very quiet.
On Mon.the library van visits,on Thurs.
the refuse is collected,and milk is    
delivered every other day.A dormobile  
collects one boy who goes to school in 
Kingscliffe."......Mrs P.Reading of
