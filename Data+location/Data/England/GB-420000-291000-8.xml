		<title>08LEA FORD COTTAGE</title>
		<content>    Lea Ford Cottage originally stood  
 just beyond Church Pool covert and    
 overlooked a ford across the River    
 Tame. In August 1975 work began on    
 dismantling the cottage &amp; restoring &amp; 
 resiting it. Skilled workers          
 reconstructed the cottage, restoring  
 oak timbers, infilling with wattle and
 daub. A thatched roof of long straw   
 was tied to the battens below with    
 bramble and the reconstruction (re_   
 erected in 1977) shows it just as it  
 was 300 years ago when it was known as
 Maggots Croft. Deeds showing the sale 
 of the cottage together with barn &amp;   
 garden to Sir Charles Adderley in 1675
 indicate that the cost was Â£20.       
    Downstairs the cottage has a main  
 room where the family would live, cook
 &amp; eat meals, &amp; an inner room which    
 would have been used for storage.     
 Upstairs were two bedrooms.           </content>
