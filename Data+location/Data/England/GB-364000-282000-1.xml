		<content> This is a{rural area}with a small     
 village in the S.E. corner of the     
 block. There is a shop, P.O., School, 
 2 public houses, &amp; a church.    {     
{Nearest towns }to Stottesdon are:     
 Cleobury Mortimer 5mls, Bridgnorth 10 
 mls, Bewdley 10 mls, Ludlow 10 mls,   
 Kidderminster 13 mls, Shrewsbury &amp;    
 Birmingham 30 mls.                    
{The land}is a plateau dissected by    
 many small, steep sided water courses,
 resulting in steep gradients on some  
 of the narrow, winding roads. The clay
 soil is cultivated in small fields,   
 bounded by hedgerows in which grow    
 mature trees. There are also          
 plantations of conifers usually       
 underplanted with deciduous saplings. 
 Most farmhouses have an ancient       
 orchard no longer managed as such.    
 There are trees everywhere, though not
 in concentrated areas of woodland.    </content>
