		<content> Wisborough Green is situated on the   
 A272 between Petworth and             
 Billingshurst.In the centre of the    
 village is a large green surrounded by
 chestnut trees.Many tourists come in  
 summer to picnic,pick soft fruit or   
 look over the ancient church.         
 Many people retire to the village and 
 live in its well preserved cottages.  
 The area is predominantly rural with a
 lot of grassland and woods.Many people
 keep horses and there is a certain    
 amount of cereal growing and          
 horticulture.                         
 The name of the village has always    
 been associated with cricket which    
 is played on the green in summer.
