		<title>04Hills Cider Farm Staverton</title>
		<content> Mr.Hill's father Edwin started making 
 cider on a commercial basis in 1934   
 with the old wooden presses that were 
 there. Whiteways Cider Company bought 
 out all the cider making capacity here
 except Hills.Three farmworkers now    
 operate hydraulic presses that process
 about 3000 tons of apples sent in by  
 localfarmers into some 25,000 gallons 
 of cider,designated rough,medium or   
 sweet. Nothing artificial is used     
 except sodium metabisulphide to       
 prevent the juice from spoiling.The   
 pomace from this process is the       
 favourite food of Mr.Hill's dairy     
 herd.The polythene bottles of cider   
 are  now sent all over Devon and      
 especially to public houses in this   
 area.Trailers loaded with the cider   
 apples start arriving in October and  
 the cider making continues apace until
 the end of December.                  </content>
