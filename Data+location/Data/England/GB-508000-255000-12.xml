		<title>12WILDEN PARISH CHURCH.</title>
		<content> Yesterday we visited St. Nicholas     
 Church. Rev. Griffith met us there and
 took us in. It was built in 1340. We  
 saw the Sanctuary knob on the door.   
 Next we saw the font in the nave. Rev.
 let us stand in the pulpit where he   
 gives people a talking to from.       
 In the children's corner there's an   
 old chest with 1635 on it. I saw a    
 corn cross on the side of the organ   
 that Mrs. Archer had made.            
 We were aloud to play the organ, but  
 we weren't very good.                 
 In the vestry, the Rector showed us   
 the Registers. There had been one     
 funeral and two weddings this year.   
 I saw my name in there too. Not the   
 wedding one. The Baptism one. We saw  
 the chalice and patten too. There's an
 owl carved above the door to the      
 belfry. It's very old. Our church is  
 really lovely.It's small and friendly.</content>
