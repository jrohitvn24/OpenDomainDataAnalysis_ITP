		<title>18HOME FARM.</title>
		<content> Home Farm dates back to about 1886.   
 There are 175 acres. The crops they   
 grow are wheat, barley, oats and rape.
 The farm has 2 combine harvesters, 2  
 tractors, a plough and a land rover.  
 The farm is near Aycliffe, Darlington,
 Bishop Auckland and Durham, so they   
 can sell their crops easily. There are
 a few farm buildings including farm   
 houses. There is a pond where a       
 moorhen nests every year. There are   
 chickens and sheep. The farm is       
 surrounded by trees. When I went, I   
 saw a swallow's nest and a few        
 starlings' nests. They had a ginger   
 cat and a black and white one.Some    
 chickens wandered about the farmyard, 
 with 5 cockerels amongst them. The    
 barn was full of straw. On the O.S.   
 map of 1953 the farm was called Park  
 Farm, but now it is named Home Farm.
