		<title>07Road Development:Chatteris</title>
		<content>    The proposed Chatteris{bypass}will 
 be part of the Fen Link strategy to   
 improve roads in the area.            
 (Improvements have already been made  
 to the March and Huntingdon roads).   
 The bypass will be a single           
 carriageway two miles long, costing   
 around{Â£1 million per mile,}passing to
 the east of the town. It is expected  
 to carry a mixture of local and       
 national freight traffic and will help
 to stimulate development and jobs.    
    Local{opposition}has centred round 
 the proposed route of the new road.   
 This opposition comes from landowners 
 who do not want to lose their land.   
 Another difficulty is building the    
 road on the soft Fen soil. Special    
 drainage work is needed. The new road 
 should take about 12 months to build  
 and be ready in autumn{1987.}Central  
 government and County Council pay.    </content>
