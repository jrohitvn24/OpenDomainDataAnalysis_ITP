		<content> My street is a cul-de-sac. There are  
 eighteen houses and two bungalows. In 
 our street there are loads of children
 and every night, if it is fine, we    
 will be playing on our bikes. On      
 Sundays there are always lawn mowers  
 going, drills drilling and kids       
 screaming.                            
 My next door neighbours own a field.  
 They keep goats, other people's horses
 and their own Shetland pony called    
 Paddy. Recently Jean reared a goat    
 called Jeffrey; he used to climb up   
 Jane and Zoe's slide, swing on their  
 swing and irritate the rabbits and    
 guinea pig.  They are entering the    
 carnival, Paddy will pull a 'wild     
 west' wagon and we will ride as       
 pioneer girls.                        
 Nothing exciting happens in my street 
 because it is small but when a man    
 died the news got round very quickly. </content>
