		<title>17Smarden West - River Beult</title>
		<content> The river Beult rises near Ashford and
 flows west through Smarden to enter   
 the Medway at Yalding. 3 bridges cross
 the river in the area. Hadman's       
 Bridge, now bypassed by a wider road, 
 is a fine example of local design. The
 river supports various species of fish
 and wildfowl and abounds with water   
 lilies. Dam boards are set in place in
 spring to hold back the water and so  
 keep stock from straying but are      
 removed in winter to prevent flooding.
 However, after heavy rain many low    
 lying fields and roads are often under
 water. A flood warning system is      
 operated to warn householders of      
 rising water. The river carries water 
 draining into it from many ditches.
