		<title>09The village hall &amp; Library</title>
		<content> Coxheath village hall was opened in   
 the early 1970's, the necessary       
 monies being raised in the area and   
 not much having been given in         
 grants. The building is on the site of
 the old burial ground for the         
 Coxheath Workhouse.  Today the hall   
 serves all sections of the community  
 from pre-school playgroups through    
 ballet, judo, badminton and other     
 activities up to indoor bowls for     
 senior citizens.                      
                                       
 The library was opened in 1984 to     
 replace a small library in the Village
 Hall.  It is situated on the corner of
 the school grounds and Heath Road.    
 The library has the distinction of    
 being the first library in Kent to    
 have been purpose-built with a        
 computerised issuing system, rather   
 than the old manual system.           </content>
