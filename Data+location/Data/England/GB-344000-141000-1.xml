		<content> The block in question stands in the   
 middle of the "Ancient Vale Of Avalon"
 and even stands though it is fourteen 
 miles from the coast the average      
 height is four metres above sea-level.
 Virtually the whole of the block is   
 covered with intensively farmed       
 grassland which overlies a layer of   
 peat reaching a depth of three or four
 metres.   There is a necessity for    
 effective drainage and the whole area 
 is crossed with ditches, drainage     
 channels or "rhymes" as they are      
 called locally.   These have divided  
 the landscape into clearly defined    
 rectangular fields.   Only a few      
 people are employed directly in       
 agriculture but many more work in     
 neighbouring peat factories.   The    
 majority are employed in the nearby   
 towns of Glastonbury and Street. There
 is some new residential development   </content>
