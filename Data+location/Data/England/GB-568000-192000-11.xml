		<content> A teacher who left to have a baby told
 us about ante and post natal care.    
 First, she visited her General        
 Practitioner, he confirmed her        
 pregnancy and sent her to the         
 maternity unit at Basildon Hospital.  
 She visited the unit monthly, her     
 urine was tested and her blood        
 pressure checked. At sixteen weeks she
 had a scan which was exciting because 
 she saw her baby on a screen. She     
 stopped work eleven weeks before her  
 baby was due.Classes were arranged to 
 teach the mothers about caring for    
 their babies and they were shown the  
 labour ward. Both parents were shown  
 films of the birth of a baby.Mothers  
 stay in hospital between 48 hours and 
 seven days. At home a midwife visits  
 for the first three days,a health     
 visitor visits on the fourth. Children
 continue to have check ups in school. </content>
