		<title>10The Abbey National</title>
		<content>A building society helps people to buy 
their own house. It lends money that   
others have invested with the society. 
Building societies have been running   
for 200 years but the Abbey National   
started in 1944 when they were 2       
groups;one was called the Abbey Road   
and the other was called The National. 
They have one main computer but 3000   
computers spread throughout their      
branches. It is thought that in the    
future building societies will act     
like estate agents as well.
