		<title>07EVENTS IN OLDBURY</title>
		<content>    There are many events in Oldbury on
 Severn.  There is a village Fair with 
 a Gymkhana, side stalls and even a    
 boat tub race held on the Pill (a     
 natural stream.)  The children from   
 the school take part in Maypole       
 dancing.                              
    We have a Fun Run, Horticultural   
 Show (adults and children can enter.) 
 There is a Pancake Race for the       
 children of the village.  The village 
 enters the Best Kept Village competion
 and has finished runner-up in the     
 small villages' competition.          
    There is a lot of Fox Hunting in   
 this area by the Berkeley Hunt.  The  
 huntsmen are dressed in their yellow  
 and green riding jackets and sometimes
 we see them riding past the school.
