 There is not a lot of business in this
 area.It is mainly a farming area.There
 are two general stores in Plumpton    
 Green,and a butcher.There is also one 
 in East Chiltington.There are two pubs
 in the village,the Sun and the        
 Fountain,and one in East Chiltington  
 called The Jolly Sportsman.There are  
 two garages,both which mend cars.     
 Hamsey Brickworks makes two types of  
 brick.Sussex is famous for bricks.In  
 East Chiltington there is a           
 blacksmith.There is also a farm where 
 solar panels are made.Recently Hills  
 of Plumpton have opened an            
 H.G.V.driving school.There are        
 probably many people working from     
 their own homes we cannot see.
