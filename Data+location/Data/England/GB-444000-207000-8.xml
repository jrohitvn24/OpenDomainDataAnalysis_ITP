		<title>08Occupations in Wytham (2)</title>
		<content>    In 1981 in Wytham, no active men   
 between 16 and 64 were unemployed. No 
 details of what occupied men and women
 between these ages was available. Our 
 information was obtained by talking to
 people in the village.                
    Men still work on the farms; the   
 forester and the keeper look after the
 woods but now the sawmill, the field  
 station and the laboratory provide new
 occupations. People also work outside 
 the village in highly skilled jobs.   
 There is a vicar not a curate in the  
 parish; the innkeeper has at least 6  
 staff. Wytham has no school, but 2    
 teachers live in the village and teach
 elsewhere. An author, several         
 university dons, some students, a     
 hairdresser, a postwoman, the keeper  
 of The Ashmolean Museum, all live in  
 the village, but in 1985 there are 31 
 people of "pensionable age".          </content>
