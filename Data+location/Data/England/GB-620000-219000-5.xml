  THE TRIANGLE SHOPPING CENTRE IN      
 FRINTON IS WIDELY USED BY LOCAL       
 PEOPLE.WE DECIDED TO GO THERE TO FIND 
 OUT WHAT PEOPLE LIKED ABOUT IT.MOST   
 PEOPLE USE THE GATEWAY SUPERMARKET    
 STORE BECAUSE IT IS VERY BIG.IT HAS   
 ALL THE FOOD THEY WANT AND IT IS A    
 REASONABLE PRICE.THE SHOPPERS SAID    
 THAT THE CENTRE HAS CHANGED A LOT FOR 
 THE BETTER.HERE IS A LIST OF SOME     
 OTHER SHOPS AT THE TRIANGLE: THE      
 BUTCHERS, AN ELECTRONIC SHOP, MARTIN'S
 NEWSAGENTS, A FRUIT AND VEGETABLE     
 SHOP, A BAKERS, A WOOL SHOP, WHICH    
 ALSO SELLS CLOTHES, COOK'S OFF LICENCE
 WHICH STARTED UP IN 1885, A PUB CALLED
 THE GREEN KING, A FURNITURE SHOP, A   
 COMMUNITY CENTRE, A CHEMIST AND TWO   
 DOCTORS. LOCAL PEOPLE WOULD LIKE A    
 SHOE SHOP, BUT GENERALLY THEY ARE     
 PLEASED WITH THE FACILITIES.          </content>
