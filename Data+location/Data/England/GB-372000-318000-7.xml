		<title>07Newport Cattle Market</title>
		<content>{Newport Cattle Market}is found in the 
 Stafford Road, and is open every      
 Monday. Although the local{farming}   
 community use this market, business   
 has declined in recent years.         
{Livestock}sold includes cattle,pigs,  
 sheep and sometimes polultry. Although
 the animals arrive in the middle of   
 the morning,{auctioning}time varies   
 depending upon the weather and the    
 number of animals. All livestock sold 
 is killed for meat but no slaughtering
 takes place in Newport. The animals   
 are weighted on a{weighbridge}.The    
 price of the meat is fixed at so much 
 per kilo and the animal has a sticker 
 placed on it's body to show it's      
 weight. Here is an example cattle     
 Â£1.00 per kg.
