		<content> The general health standards of the   
 people of Riding Mill are very good.  
 There are no particular problems with 
 the children of the village, but there
 are problems with the elderly probably
 due to loneliness.                    
 There is no longer a surgery in the   
 village but there is a clinic held in 
 the Parish Hall. Babies are weighed   
 and given their injections and if     
 there are any problems there is a     
 doctor and the Health Visitor talks to
 mothers about feeding and changing.   
 There is also a chiropody clinic and  
 meals on wheels for the elderly.      
 Medicines are taken to a cottage in   
 Broomhaugh and the people go there to 
 collect their medicines and pills     
 instead of travelling to Corbridge.   
 There is a volunteer rota for this    
 good cause. The doctor nurse and      
 dentist visit the children at school. </content>
