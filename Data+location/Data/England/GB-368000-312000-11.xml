		<title>11SIKH COMMUNITY, TELFORD</title>
		<content> There are about 200 Sikh families     
 living in the Trench area of Telford, 
 most of whom came to this country in  
 the 1960s.The religious and social    
 life of the Sikh community centres on 
 the local Gurdwara or temple.This is a
 converted school building in Hadley - 
 about 1.5 miles away.It is open at all
 times for worship and also provides   
 lodging and food for any one in need. 
 The majority of Sikhs go to the temple
 on Sundays.During a Sangat,or assembly
 which lasts for about 3 hours people  
 come and go and children move about   
 freely.The Sunday Sangat at Hadley is 
 followed by a communal meal for those 
 who wish to stay.The Sikhs in this    
 area are a close-knit community who   
 retain their own customs and          
 traditions while adapting their way of
 life to suit the living and working   
 patterns of the area.                 </content>
