		<title>02GWENNAP CHURCH</title>
		<content> The Parish Church at Gwennap is       
 dedicated to St.Wenappa - a Celtic    
 Saint. The earliest{church}was founded
 in 500 A.D. but the present{building} 
 dates from 1200 A.D.                  
 The Bell Tower is detached from the   
 main church and is probably           
 15th.Century. The bells were hung in  
 the 18th.Century and were probably    
 paid for from the proceeds from the   
 sale of the original stained glass    
 windows.                              
 The granite pillars are the{second    
{highest}in Cornwall. There is a fine  
 carved slate{memorial}to a mine agent 
 carved by N.N.Burnard of Altarnun at  
 the age of 15. The oldest slate       
 memorial is to James Perrowe who died 
 of smallpox in 1691.                  
 Legend has it that the church is      
 haunted by the{ghost}of one of the    
 earlier canons.                       </content>
