		<title>05UTILITY SURVEY: REFLECTIONS.</title>
		<content>   It was decided that the results of  
 the Utility Survey were worthy of     
 comment as an introduction to this    
 Survey area. This is a diverse and    
 interesting area on the fringes of the
 South Manchester Suburbs. The area is 
 almost equally divided between arable 
 crops other than grass and intensively
 managed grassland as{primary land     
{cover category.}This latter grassland 
 area was mostly on the fringes near   
 woods, brooks and golf courses etc.   
 Industry is almost non_existent and   
 only just qualifies for recording.    
 Urban recreational open space was     
 also common. Only two areas merited   
 detailed scrutiny to count amenities  
 and some surprises emerged,such as the
 lack of dentists.Worth mention,yet not
 counted, are the railway, River Bollin
 and motorway which are obvious on the 
 map yet cover little surface area.    </content>
