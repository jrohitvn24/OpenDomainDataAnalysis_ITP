		<title>13Mechanisation in farming</title>
		<content>                                       
 The farms in this area are efficiently
 worked by{families}employing 1 or 2   
 others.   There has been a great      
 increase in{mechanisation}in the last 
 40 years. (see page on Change)  There 
 is a local Agricultural Contractor,   
 who amongst other things, does combine
 harvesting work but some farmers do   
 the necessary work themselves.   All  
 have at least 1 tractor and most have 
 a landrover. Most have errected large 
 storage barns over recent years.  Many
 farms accomodate{tourists}and supply  
 milk, cream and eggs.   In the        
 immediate vicinity a working farm has 
 specially adapted his milking parlour 
 so that the general public can watch  
 milking in progress.
