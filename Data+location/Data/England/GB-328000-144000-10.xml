 If he suceeds he calls out Victory    
 and raises his arms in the air, and   
 the remaining players have to run to  
 the opposite home without being       
 caught.                               
                                       
 4)Any player who is caught has to     
 join the player(s) who are on it.     
 5) The catcher (when he calls a       
 player) can count to ten, and if by   
 the time he has counted to ten,the    
 player he has called has not run, the 
 catcher can come into the home and try
 to catch him.                         
                                       
 This is a rough game, and sometimes   
 the children thunder across the       
 playground like a herd of elephants.  
 The game ends  when all the players   
 are chasing one person. It is a very  
 exciting game.                        </content>
