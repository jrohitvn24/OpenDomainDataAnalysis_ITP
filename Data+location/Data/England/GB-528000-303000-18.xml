		<title>18A Day in my Life in Thorney</title>
		<content>   When break has finished we do other 
 work up to dinner time. We have       
 exactly 75 minutes. We then do work   
 right the way up to{3.30}when school  
 finishes, with a break at{2.08.}At    
{4.00}I have my tea and then watch T.V.
 My dad comes home for tea at{4.00,}and
 then he has to go back to work at     
{5.00.}At{5.00}I go to the park and    
 meet my friend Sara. I play at the    
 park for about 2 hours. We usually    
 play on the swings, go down the       
 dykes, and play on the wild muddy     
 ground behind the tennis courts.      
   My dad finishes at{8.00,}so I go    
 home. I then have a wash, have supper 
 and go to bed about{9.00.}This is what
 happens on week days. At the week-end 
 we would go to town or perhaps see our
 relations.                            
                                       
                                       </content>
