		<content> Mr{J.Oke}lives at the first cottage in
 April Lane and is employed as a part  
 time farm labourer. He has the        
 distinction of being the honorary     
 Swimbridge spoon bender, a title      
 bestowed upon him many years ago. He  
 is probably the last spoon bender in  
 the West Country.{ During the Summer  
{and Autumn, bearded Mr.Oke can be seen
{winding his way through the lanes and 
{by-ways of North Devon on his ex.     
{G.P.O. bicycle dressed in the         
{tradional garb of shorts, bobble hat  
{and blue apron from isolated          
{farmsteads to village squares where   
{residents rush out in glee to have    
{their spoons bent back into shape     
{before the onset of the dark Winter   
{months when no respectable North Devon
{family would wish it to be known that 
{they were the users  of               
{    out of shape pudding utensils.    </content>
