		<title>03PILLEY IN BOLDRE PARISH</title>
		<content> The boundary between Boldre and Pilley
 is hard to define.The villages are    
 part of each other and form a spread  
 out,looseknit community.From the poor 
 to the rich,from young couples with   
 families to plan for to the retired   
 seeking to maintain the status quo it 
 is sometimes hard to find common      
 agreement and factions do arise.      
 The Fleur de Lys pub dates from the   
 13th century,the village hall is a    
 memorial to the fallen of the 1st     
 world war,the school was one of the   
 earliest of its kind,the W.I. started 
 in 1917 and the championship Tug of   
 War Team is nearly as old,the village 
 is concious of the past.There is a    
 demand for housing for the young and  
 though this is a difficult problem to 
 resolve,the future,it is plain,also   
 matters to Pilley/Boldre.
