		<content> In the 19th century the railway and   
 main road bypassed the village of     
 Okrford Fitzpaine, leaving it         
 isolated.  However, new industries    
 made their homes here and the village 
 began to develop.  A milk factory     
 opened in Higher Street, producing    
 milk, butter and cheese, and the      
 brickworks in Shillingstone Lane      
 expanded. The chalk quarry            
 at Shillingstone continued to provide 
 employment and the village has        
 continued to combine local industry   
 with a peaceful village environment.
