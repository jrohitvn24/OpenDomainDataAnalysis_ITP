		<title>20LONGDENDALE RESERVOIRS</title>
		<content> Five reservoirs were built in the     
 Longdendale Valley during the 19th    
 century. They were built to supply    
 water to Manchester. However the two  
 in the survey area - Bottoms and      
 Valehouse - were too low to supply    
 water and were used to contain flood  
 and overflow water. They also supplied
 water to the mills along the Etherow. 
 The chief engineer, J.F.Bateman, lived
 in Arnfield Tower built for him in    
 1850. Situated in Tintwistle it is now
 a field study centre. Today Bottoms   
 Reservoir is used for recreation      
 purposes such as fishing and yachting.
