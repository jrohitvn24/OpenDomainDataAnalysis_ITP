		<title>07Transport - Barby</title>
		<content>This D-block contains the dismantled   
remains of the Central Railway, the    
Oxford Canal (now only used by holiday 
makers) and the busy A.45.  Our survey 
of the parents ofthe pupils in classes 
3 and 4 revealed that every household  
had at least one car.  Several parents 
also used motor cycles and pedal       
cycles, only one person used the local 
bus service.  The huge increase in car 
ownership over the last twenty-five    
years has brought greater mobility,    
this combined with Barby's location    
convenient for the M1 and with easy    
access to London via Rugby Station,    
has meant that Barby has gradually     
changed from being a fairly self       
sufficient village to a dormitory      
village where many people are away     
during the day time returning only  to 
sleep.                                 
                                       </content>
