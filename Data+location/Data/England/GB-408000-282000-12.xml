		<title>12Ackers Leisure Park   B'ham</title>
		<content>The Ackers Leisure Park lies on 19     
hectares of former wasteland south of  
the Small Heath Bypass. It originated  
in 1977 as a reclamation scheme by     
Oldknow School and in 1981 The Ackers  
Trust was registered as a charity.     
Finance for the clearance of rubble    
and planting of thousands of trees has 
come from West Midlands Council. The   
park is crossed by the InterCity rail  
line and Grand Union Canal as well as  
the River Cole. Improvements already   
made include the National Motorcycle   
Circuit, a manmade ski slope and a     
renovated canal basin. The high point  
is the artificially built Ackers Hill- 
125m which gives a fine view of the    
area. Future plans include boating,    
climbing, picnicking and riding        
facilities as well as a riverside walk 
between Warwick and Coventry roads, a  
direct link to the Railway Museum.     </content>
