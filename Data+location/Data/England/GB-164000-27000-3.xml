		<title>03BEATING THE BOUNDS, HELSTON</title>
		<content>{Beating the Bounds}is celebrated in   
 Helston each year. Ten children are   
 chosen from each of the local schools.
 They are accompanied by the Mayor,    
 Mayoress and other council officials  
 of Helston.                           
      A sod of turf is cut and placed  
 on each Boundary Stone, where it is   
 beaten by the children with sprigs of 
 May when available. Also, some people 
 are turned upside down and their heads
 are banged three times on each stone. 
      Eight Boundary Stones were beaten
 this year. The Boundary Stones are    
 marked with{HB}. HB stands for Helston
 Boundary. The Boundary Stones are made
 from granite because it is a very hard
 local rock. We "beat" the Boundary    
 Stones each year so that the Boundary 
 of Helston is remembered. This used to
 be very important before the          
 introduction of maps.                 </content>
