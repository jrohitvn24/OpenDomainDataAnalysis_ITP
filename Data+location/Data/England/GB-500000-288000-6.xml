		<content>My name is Penny Keeling and I am 9    
years old.   I get up at 7.OOa.m. and  
go downstairs for breakfast.    I have 
toast and a drink of lemon juice,      
then I get into my school dress and get
my school bag ready.   After that I say
goodbye to Mum and Dad and then I go to
the bus stop and get on the bus.   When
I get to school Mr. Palmer calls our   
names out to see if we are there and   
then we go to have assembly in a class.
After that we do some work like Story  
and English.  At dinner time we can    
have packed lunches or a hot dinner and
we go out to play.   In the afternoon  
we do work or on Monday we do painting,
cookery or pottery.  In the afternoon  
after last play we go home.  After     
school I play or watch television.  I  
have tea and I have a bath and go to   
bed at 8.OOp.m.
