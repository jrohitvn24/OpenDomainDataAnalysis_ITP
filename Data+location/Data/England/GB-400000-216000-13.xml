		<title>13Stage Coach Stop</title>
		<content>    From the time of William the       
 Conqueror's survey until the coming of
 the first stage wagons on the local   
 roads in the middle of the sixteenth  
 century the Frogmill would have       
 changed but little.The roads were only
 rough tracks and the Frogmarsh which  
 adjoined the Coln was a treacherous   
 place for pack horses and             
 travellers.Even medieval records refer
 to this area as Frogmarsh and the     
 present inn must have got its name    
 from this source.When the long-       
 wagons gave place to the stage coaches
 at the end of the seventeenth century,
 the Frogmill became a very important  
 staging inn.Here stopped for a change 
 of horses many famous coaches and by  
 the 1830's at least twenty coaches    
 were changing teams here daily.
