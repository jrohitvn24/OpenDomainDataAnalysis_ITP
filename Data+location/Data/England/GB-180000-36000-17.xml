		<content>   TREMAYNE HALL; built as a poor house
 in 1921.Changed to a school a few     
 months later, was burnt down and was  
 rebuilt as a church hall as the       
 education commitee gave it to the     
 Parish Council.The hall is used for   
 many different things; once a month   
 Womens Institute, every Wednesday     
 there is Bingo for old age pensioners.
 CONSERVATIVE HALL;built for the       
 conservative party in 1954.Every      
 Tuesday, Thursday and Friday doctors  
 hold a surgery there, and at the      
 moment a new surgery is being built   
 for them. YOUTH CENTRE;people of Mylor
 wanted the centre to be used for the  
 community as the youth of Mylor were  
 not interested in having disco's in   
 the summer.The centre is let out to   
 youth organisations,such as Brownies. 
 The centre was built in 1961 on the   
 playing fields.                       </content>
