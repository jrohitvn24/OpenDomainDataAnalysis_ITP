 that practically every household owns 
 at least one television set.To go with
 that TV,just over half of the         
 population have a video .Approximatly 
 one/third of the owners belong to     
 video clubs and hire pre_recorded     
 tapes.Colour TV's by a ratio of 6 to  
 1.The majority of homes also own a    
 radio and tape recorder.Nearly 98% of 
 homes buy a newspaper.The most popular
 papers are the{SUNDERLAND ECHO,DAILY  
{MIRROR,and DAILY MAIL.}The most       
 popular  magazines are{WOMANS Own and 
{WOMAN. Twice as many non fictional    
 books are read compared to fictional  
 books from the public libaries,whilst 
 only 42% admit to buying books.In

 outnumber business letters by a ratio 
 of 2 to 1.
