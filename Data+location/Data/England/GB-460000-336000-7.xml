 flying club where people can learn how
 to fly aeroplanes. They give training 
 for people who want to get a Private  
 Pilot's licence. Some night flying is 
 done by people who are training. There
 is also a self-fly hire service of    
 light aircraft.                       
    The{Air Taxi}service is very useful
 for local business people. Small light
 aircraft like Pipers, Robins,         
 Chipmunks and Cessnas are used. Some  
 helicopters are also flown from the   
 Airport. Passengers are able to depart
 and land when they wish which makes it
 a very useful service for the local   
 people.
