		<title>13RECREATION IN OLD BUCKENHAM</title>
		<content> The main building for recreation in   
 the village is the Village Hall which 
 was opened in 1979.  This is very well
 used by the community, from the Mother
 and Toddler Group to the Old Peoples' 
 Luncheon Club.  For the children there
 is a Playgroup three times a week and 
 a Youth Club once a week for older    
 children.                             
 Adults here have a lot of choice of   
 organizations to join, including      
 Flower Club, Carpet Bowls, Wine       
 Circle, Theatrical Players and Womens'
 Institute.                            
 The Hall is hired out for discos,     
 wedding receptions, special parties   
 and occasional quizzes.  There are    
 weekly evening Bingo sessions as well 
 as Keep Fit and a monthly clinic run  
 by a Health Visitor.  The Hall is used
 for fairs and fund-raising activities,
 particularly near to Christmas.       </content>
