		<title>07CHURNET VALLEY WILDLIFE</title>
		<content>Herons fly up the valley and fish in   
the river.Grey wagtail, kingfishers and
dippers have re-appeared on the River  
Churnet which is now able  to  support 
fish and other wildlife after years of 
pollution.                             
 Redstarts,woodwarblers,flycatchers and
sparrowhawks are among the rich variety
of woodland birds.There are still hedge
-row birds such as yellowhammer,linnets
and goldfinch in good numbers. Buzzards
have re-established themselves close-by
 Stoats,weasels,rabbits and other small
mammals  are  plentiful  and  there are
good numbers of badgers and foxes.     
Munchat deer have been seen.           
 The remnants of deciduous woodland are
very rich entomologically, maintaining 
an insect population of 200 years ago.A
rare caddisfly breeds in Dimmingsdale. 
There are many records in the North    
Staffordshire Field Club Journal.      </content>
