		<title>04FARMING &amp; CONSERVATION</title>
		<content> The landscape is mainly agricultural  
 and to the N.E. is the attractive Avon
 Valley. Most of the farms have dairy  
 cattle but there are some sheep and   
 pigs . Though there is artificial     
 insemination one farm keeps a freisian
 bull who is a champion. He glares at  
 you in a sly way. Conservation is a   
 big issue and includes use of         
 chemicals and clearing hedges and     
 woods. Some fields have been enlarged 
 to grow {wheat}.This has meant        
 removing habitat for hedgerow life.One
 farmer has planted extra trees in     
 inaccessible parts of fields. There is
 some pressure to thin the woods . In  
 springtime Pomeroy Wood is carpeted   
 with bluebells and you may find rare  
 orchids if you are lucky. The land is 
 criss-crossed with footpaths but there
 is little public open space.
