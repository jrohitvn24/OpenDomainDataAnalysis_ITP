		<content>When I was in the Brownies I had about 
27 badges.  We played games &amp; went on  
lots of trips &amp; camps.  We wore a brown
woolly hat, dress,belt &amp; a yellow tie. 
We went out to play &amp; worked for more  
badges.  I've only been in the Guides a
year &amp; I've been on one Guide Camp.  We
wear a blue hat, blouse &amp; skirt,a brown
belt,yellow tie &amp; a woggle. I have 3   
badges; it is all very interesting but 
I liked the Brownies best.(J.Gartside).
CUBS. Every Tuesday I go to Cubs.We pay
50p subs.We do the grand howl.This is  
where we all stand round Arkela,she    
sticks her hands out &amp; we go down into 
a crouch &amp; say "Arkela, we'll do our   
best" then we stand up &amp; the duty Sixer
stands up &amp; salutes &amp; says"Cubs,do your
best"then we go off to our Sixes &amp; our 
Sixer takes inspection,gives us marks  
for tidiness &amp; chooses who will go out 
for parade.(J.Woolley)                 </content>
