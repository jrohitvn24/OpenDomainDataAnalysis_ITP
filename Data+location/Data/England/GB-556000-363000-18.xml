		<title>18Population in Skegness</title>
		<content> We asked some people in the street    
 a few questions and these are the     
 results. About nine out of ten were   
 visitors to the area. They came from  
 places like Leicester and             
 Chesterfield. Most people were staying
 in caravan sites. Most people liked   
 walking around and going swimming.    
 Some people said that Skegness needed 
 more buses and more seats to sit      
 on for the elderly  people.           
 Winthorpe is much quieter in the      
 closed season from October to May.    
 Many holiday businesses are closed    
 down and there are fewer people       
 around. Those you meet then are likely
 to be locals. Many will be unemployed 
 during the winter and do seasonal work
 in the summer.
