		<content> Legends in Worthing's proximity:-     
 At first site,the Worthing area does  
 not seem to be a very inspiring place 
 for legends,but looks can be          
 deceptive.Right in the heart of       
 Worthing,for instance,once stood an   
 oak tree.From beneath it,it was said, 
 skeletons rose on Midsummer Eve and   
 danced hand in hand around the tree   
 until cock crow.The tree's site is now
 a triangle of land in the road        
 intersection at the end of Broadwater 
 Green.Further afield,we have a        
 Shoreham murderer whose hands still   
 strangle anyone who sleeps in a       
 partcular bed in a guest house,and a  
 monk who haunts Meeting House Lane in 
 Brighton.Other ghost stories in our   
 immediate proximity include that of   
 the 'Black Abbot' which supposedly    
 haunts Sompting Abbotts school.Two    
 ghosts also haunt Lancing College.    </content>
