The majority of homes in Cowlinge are  
on the telephone, and there is a public
telephone box in the centre of the     
village. There are two post boxes from 
which collections are made twice daily,
and postal deliveries are made twice a 
day in the main street and once a day  
to the outlaying houses. These are made
by postal van from the main post office
in Newmarket. Communication within the 
village is spread rapidly by word of   
mouth and there is also a bimonthly    
sheet 'The Cowlinge Courier' giving    
past and forthcoming events.This is    
run   by residents of the village.
