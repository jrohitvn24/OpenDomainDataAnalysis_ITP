		<title>10Glass making in Buriton</title>
		<content> Glass making was made in the beech    
 woods near Buriton, on the Ditcham    
 House Estate during Tudor times.      
 Beech wood being best suited for the  
 purpose. At the south end of Glass    
 Brow by the side of an old track,     
 which is not a public footpath, is all
 that remains of a glass works site.   
 There is a sealed well on the edge of 
 the site and the remains of kilns.    
 This site was discovered in 1970 by   
 the Rev P Gallup, the rector of       
 Buriton. Now little is visible where  
 forestry has taken over. Some of the  
 funds are deposited in Portsmouth City
 Museum (accesssion No 1971/202). Re   
 this site see "William Overotn &amp;      
 Glassmaking" by R Fox &amp; E Lewis.
