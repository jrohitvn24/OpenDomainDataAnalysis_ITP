		<content>St Mary's School was opened in 1863 in 
a building adjacent to the railway     
station in the Newsham area of Barton. 
The word Â£Newsham' means Â£at the New   
Houses' and both school and church are 
often referred to as Â£Newhouse'.       
                                       
In 1907 a new school was built nearer  
the church. The present junior         
classrooms were built in 1957 and 1963 
and the infant block was added in 1970 
thus freeing the 1907 section for use  
as a hall and dining room.             
                                       
The school serves the Roman Catholic   
parish of St Mary's. Children from     
Barton, Broughton, Woodplumpton and    
surrounding areas attend the school.
