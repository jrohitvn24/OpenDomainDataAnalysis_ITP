		<title>14MARTLESHAM - CHURCH SERVICES</title>
		<content>{The parish church of Martlesham} is   
outside the area and is isolated from  
all population centres of the village. 
At present there is no church at       
Martlesham New Village but services are
held by the rector of Martlesham and   
Brightwell in the Pavilion. Besides the
regular Sunday Service there is a      
Sunday School and a Mother and Toddler 
group. The parishioners at Martlesham  
are engaged in raising funds and it is 
hoped that eventually a church will be 
built at Martlesham Heath.             
The rector leads a busy life in this   
rapidly growing parish. He is in       
considerable demand for the conduct    
of baptisms, marriages and funerals.   
Afternoons are spent in visiting the   
elderly and the sick and most evenings 
are occupied with various meetings and 
committees.                            
                                       </content>
