		<title>05WOOKEY HOLE SCHOOL</title>
		<content>   WOOKEY HOLE SCHOOL HAS BEEN RUNNING 
 FOR OVER A CENTURY,BUT HAS NOW BECOME 
 VERY SMALL WITH THIRTY ONE CHILDREN,  
 WHO LIVE IN WOOKEY HOLE, EASTON AND   
 WELLS.                                
  THE SCHOOL IS NOT VERY EASY TO SEE   
 FROM THE VILLAGE,AS IT IS ON A HILL.IT
 LOOKS LIKE A CASTLE WITH CHURCH       
 SPIRES AND ARCHED WINDOWS. INSIDE IT  
 DOES NOT LOOK VERY OLD AS RECENTLY THE
 CEILING HAS BEEN LOWERED AND          
 MODERNISED. THERE ARE STILL THE       
 REMAINS OF AN OLD GAS LAMP BUT THERE  
 IS NOW ELECTRIC STRIP LIGHTING,MODERN 
 FURNITURE AND ELECTRICAL EQUIPMENT. IT
 IS BRIGHTLY PAINTED AND THE CHILDREN'S
 ATTRACTIVE WORK IS DISPLAYED ON THE   
 WALLS.                                
   THE OLDER CHILDREN STILL CULTIVATE  
 THEIR OWN GARDENS,GROWING VEGTABLES   
 AND FLOWERS.                          
                                       </content>
