		<content>    Although we live very close to     
 London we are in the Green Belt which 
 means that we live in an area         
 surrounded by fields and farms. It is 
 very difficult to get planning        
 permission to build new houses here   
 and there is a Green Belt Society     
 which watches demands for planning    
 very carefully. It costs Â£1 a year to 
 belong and at the meetings they decide
 what action needs taking to stop      
 development.                          
    There was a meeting in July 1985   
 when it was learned that a property   
 developer had applied for permission  
 to build over a hundred houses on     
 green land near the village. The local
 rate payers' association took up the  
 fight and there are plans to collect  
 money to buy the land for the village 
 so that it would be impossible to     
 build on it.                          </content>
