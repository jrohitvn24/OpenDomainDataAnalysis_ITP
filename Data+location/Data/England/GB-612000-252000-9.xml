		<title>09Clean Air in Coddenham</title>
		<content> Pollution attacks in many forms but in
 Coddenham we are fortunate, being     
 close to the North Sea with clean air 
 and no industry. Noise, vibration and 
 carbon monoxide are created by        
 vehicles in the narrow roads built    
 long ago for horses and carts but some
 heavy traffic from the east has been  
 re-routed recently to by-pass the High
 Street giving a measure of relief.    
 Agricultural tractors and machinery   
 however, must use the roads           
 incessantly in serving the many farms 
 in the area. In this arable farming   
 area, water supplies can be exposed to
 nitrate infiltration from crop        
 fertilisers but our Water authority   
 controls this and keeps the nitrate   
 level in water, below that decreed by 
 the European Council.
