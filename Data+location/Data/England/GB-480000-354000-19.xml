		<title>19A DAY IN MY LIFE-HOME LIFE 2</title>
		<content> The final bell of the day rings at    
 3.30p.m. and we line up ready to catch
 the bus home.                         
   Once at{home}there is time to play, 
 but "Homework" is the order shouted to
 me as I walk through the door. My     
 sister arrives home from secondary    
 school and does her homework too.     
 Finished at last and free to{play}on  
 the adventure playground or on my     
 B.M.X. bicycle. I am having fun when  
 my sister shouts to say that tea is   
 ready.                                
   By now dad is home from work. We sit
 infront of the T.V. and eat our tea.  
 I go outside to play with my friends  
 again until 7.30. Bathtime arrives,   
 followed by supper and a little       
 television. At 9.30 I clean my teeth  
 and go to bed. The radio alarm is set.
 One day is over and tomorrow to look  
 forward to. By Paul Brown  age 10.    </content>
