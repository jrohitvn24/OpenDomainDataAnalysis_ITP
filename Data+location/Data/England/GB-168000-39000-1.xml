		<content> Redruth is a town roughly in the      
 centre of the county of Cornwall.     
{Lanner and Carnkie}are two villages   
 equal distance from the town, Lanner  
 1\ miles to the East and Carnkie to   
 the South.                            
{Redruth}was the centre of the tin     
 mining industry in the last century   
 and the tin ore was sent to ports at  
{Truro and Falmouth}for shipment.The   
 tin industry has now declined except  
 for a few mines which are still       
 producing and the whole area around   
 the town is marked with abandoned mine
 shafts and spoil tips.The old mines   
 are characterised by tall chimneys    
 built from local stone and adjacent   
 engine houses. These housed the steam 
 engines which provided the power for  
 the mine. The land is now largely used
 for rough grazing for cattle.
