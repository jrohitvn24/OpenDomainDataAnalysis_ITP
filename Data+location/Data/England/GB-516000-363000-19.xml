		<content> Although Woodhall Spa is located in an
 agricultural area the population is by
 no means agricultural in its work with
 many people in fact being commuters to
 local towns.The village has a short   
 history during which the spa itself   
 was born,flourished and has now died. 
 The spa has left its mark and there   
 are now a number of hotels and other  
 recreational facilities dating back to
 its heyday.An officer is now employed 
 to publicise the other attractions of 
 the area.                             
 In the future services in the village 
 are likely to remain good although the
 number of people with cars may lead to
 a trend towards travelling elsewhere  
 to shop.There are plans afoot to build
 more houses in the village,but these  
 are likely to be aimed at the commuter
 sector of the market.
