		<title>03Henstead Church</title>
		<content> Henstead Church is situated on the    
 outskirts of the village and is       
 surrounded by beautiful countryside.  
 It was built in the 12th century and  
 has a beautiful Norman doorway. It is 
 made of flint, stones and granite and 
 inside there are four large oak beams.
 The windows on the south side were    
 renewed at the beginning of the second
 world war and were replaced with plain
 glass. Recently replaced windows have 
 been set straight into stone rather   
 than lead or timber and are cracking  
 due to the heavy traffic alongside the
 church. Any new windows will          
 definately be set into lead so that   
 they can give a little. Apparently    
 Lushes of Norwich hold the contract   
 for any new windows. Henstead Church  
 has a thatched roof which was         
 completely rethatched 55 years ago. 9 
 years ago the S side was rethatched.  </content>
