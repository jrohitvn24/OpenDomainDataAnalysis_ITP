		<title>19Law and Order in Southam</title>
		<content>  Southam's{Magistrates' Court}is next 
 door to the police station. Sessions  
 are held at the court on Monday for   
 adults and Thursday for juveniles and 
 are presided over by 3 magistrates.   
  In addition to offices the{police    
{station}has 2 cells and a printer room
 where messages can be received and    
 transmitted. In addition to a Granada 
 and 2 Escort police cars a push bike  
 has recently been acquired bringing   
 policemen "back on the beat"          
  Southam is to try to establish a     
{Neighbourhood Watch}scheme which would
 reduce local opportunities for crime  
 and help to develop a good community  
 spirit. Neighbours will look out for  
 anything suspicious and will report to
 co-ordinators (people who normally    
 spend long periods at home). They will
 then pass on the information to the   
 police to be dealt with accordingly.  </content>
