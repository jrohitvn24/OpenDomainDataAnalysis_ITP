		<title>17RECREATION: ROOKLEY PARK</title>
		<content>     In Rookley Country Park there are 
 lots of activities and things to do.  
 There is a {cafe, adventure playground
{and a lake.                           
     The Country Park is well situated 
 on the main road from which it can be 
 clearly seen. The manager said people 
 came to the park mainly because the   
 staff are so pleasant and there is    
 something for the whole family to do. 
     The land is used well here as it  
 is too poor for farming. At the Park  
 there are 33 ducks and a small pony.  
 We also found out that the caravans   
 and the Mallards Pub are an asset to  
 the local inhabitants. There are      
 motorbikes, army jeeps and an         
 inflatable bouncing tiger. The prices 
 range from 10p to 60p. There is an    
 arcade in the cafe which has alot of  
 machines. They often have car boot    
 sales for charity. {Admission is free.</content>
