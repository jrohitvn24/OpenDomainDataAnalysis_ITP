		<title>15The Retreat Inn, Littleworth</title>
		<content>   Placed in picturesque surroundings  
 opposite the old village school, The  
 Retreat Inn was built in 1939. During 
 the war and since it has been used by 
 soldiers from Norton Barracks, by     
 local villagers and others who play   
 Crib, Darts and Skittles there. The   
 Skittles Alley is only two years old  
 and was built by M.G. Cowley in the   
 old function room.                    
   The pub sells Marstons Beer and is  
 featured in The Good Beer Guide. The  
 Inn has ample parking space and has   
 chairs in the garden for fine weather 
 drinking. The building has a large    
 slate roof with many chimneys. The    
 outside was originally red brick but  
 has now been painted a mottled grey   
 colour. The Old Retreat Inn was       
 situated in  field nearby the present 
 building but is now unused and a ruin.
