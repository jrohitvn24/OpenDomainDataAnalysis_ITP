		<title>07THE ORIEL SWORD</title>
		<content> The Oriel Sword is a two handed sword,
 it is 1.68m long including a leather  
 covered hilt with a wrought steel     
 cross guard as well, probably of the  
 C16th (1500's). About 15cm of the     
 sword were engraved with a bit of     
 decoration.  There were three words in
 Latin saying:"FIGHT FOR THE           
 NATION".And a coat of arms in initials
 of "R.D." with a date of l423, and    
 some wavy lines too.                  
 Swainswick village belonged to Oriel  
 College Estate.  Richard Dudley gave  
 Swainswick Manor to Oriel College. In 
 l870 Mr Richard Shackell, a tenant,   
 kept the sword preserved in the Manor 
 Farm for many years.  Then it was     
 carried in local processions to the   
 church for the thanksgiving service of
 the recovery of the Prince of Wales   
 (Edward VII). In l902 it was taken to 
 Oriel College.Bath City keep duplicate</content>
