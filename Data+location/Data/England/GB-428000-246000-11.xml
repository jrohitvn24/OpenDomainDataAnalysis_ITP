		<content> Pillerton Hersey, Pillerton Priors    
 and Fulready are set in the southern  
 part of Warwickshire and can truly    
 be called rural England and so for    
 the tourist they offer the            
 opportunity to relax in the country   
 air. Fulready can boast one holiday   
 house and Pillerton Priors bed and    
 breakfast accommodation.  Neither of  
 the villages has an inn or eating     
 house but all are within a very       
 short drive, 2 to 3 miles of          
 excellent country pubs. Either of     
 these villages is an excellent spot   
 from which to explore Stratford and   
 Shakespeare land,Leamington Spa,.     
 Warwick with its castle and other     
 antiquities. Within 1 hours driving   
 distance are the beautiful villages of
 the Cotswolds. Those more physically  
 active may enjoy the many country     
 walks.                                </content>
