 would use a 'chain' to measure distnt 
 from school to vicarage or the        
 distance round a turnip plot. Magic   
 lantern shows - for geography.        
 Daily Inspection took place for genral
 cleanliness,clean shoes etc.,         
 Games played - shuttlecock, hoop -    
 round steeel hoops were made by the   
 local smithy, top and whip..
