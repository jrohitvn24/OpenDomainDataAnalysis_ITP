		<content> The areaa is very well wooded on the  
 higher central area between the       
 valleys of the Umborne and the Offwell
 Brook. The largest area is in the     
 care of the Forestry Commission and   
 comes under the tile of the Neroche   
 Forest. Part of this 'forest' can be  
 found miles away in Somerset and also 
 in the Colytin area. The trees are of 
 both carboniferous and deciduous      
 types. There is also an area which is 
 used for growing the fast growing     
 conifers - a cash crop. Until recently
 there were a great number of fine     
 elms, but these have virtually all    
 been felled as a result of Dutch Elm  
 disease. The lower levels of the river
 valleys are also pleasantly wooded.   
 Widworthy &amp; Watchcome Woods are of    
 typically English mixed trees. West of
 Home Bush is a small area of rather   
 stunted woodland &amp; heathland.         </content>
