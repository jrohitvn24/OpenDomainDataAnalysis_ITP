		<title>01LAWRENCE WESTON'S LANDSCAPE</title>
		<content> There is a large contrast in the      
 landscape of our D Block. In the{west 
 near the River Severn the landscape   
 consists of{reclaimed flat land}about 
 50 metres above sea level. Much of    
 this area has been used to build many 
 new{industries}such as chemical and   
 smelting works and a trading estate.  
 Although there are a few{farms}such as
 Poplar Farm with fields of pasture    
 crossed by rhines or drainage ditches,
 the land has never been of great use  
 to farmers. To the{east}and{south}the 
 land rises gently until it reaches    
 about 100 metres at Kingsweston Ridge.
 This{higher land}has the post war     
 council{housing estates}of Lawrence   
 Weston and Shirehampton and the       
 private housing of Coombe Dingle. In  
 the middle of these housing areas are 
 the{woods and parks}of the Blaise     
 Castle Estate.       St. Bede's School</content>
