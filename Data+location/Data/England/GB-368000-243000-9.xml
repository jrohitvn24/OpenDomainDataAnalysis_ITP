		<content> (CONTINUE liked living here because   
 it is a nice village and a nice       
 school. Mr Parry said there were      
 plenty of females around!.            
                                       
 MRS. BUNCE                            
 Mrs Bunce said that  she had lived in 
 this area  for 9 years and that her   
 property is 100 years old. Her family 
 has lived in this area for 9 years    
 and love it here very much.They moved 
 from Kent because we heard that       
 Bosbury was lovely and quiet and that 
 the people were friendly. They spend  
 their freetime visiting trust property
 and gardening. We shop every week in  
 Ledbury and Malvern.
