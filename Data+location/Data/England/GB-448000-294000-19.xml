		<content> As will be realised the area is a     
 rural one and as such the population  
 is not too large . The two villages   
 are very different in constitution and
 size.Croft has a relatively           
 contracting population since there is 
 no new expected building in the       
 village.There is a growing older      
 population in the village and         
 a contracting younger one .This has   
 been evidenced by the school          
 population falling. The population of 
 the village is approximately 1900 with
 an under 16 population of about       
 400.The village of Stoney Stanton has 
 expanded recently with a new estate of
 approximately 150 homes.The village   
 population is much larger than Croft, 
 almost double in size.With a still    
 expanding population the range of ages
 and their relative sizes has meant a  
 greater need for facilities.          </content>
