  The a265 runs along the path of a    
 Roman road and coincides with the line
 of the Greenwich Meridian. This road  
 was once an iron age track and was    
 about 3000 years old. It was th only  
 route to the sea without using rivers.
 Bell lane is also very old.           
 TRANSPORT                             
  The bus service is not good. Each day
 6 buses go through Danehill to        
 Haywards Heath and 4 come through on  
 the way to East Grinstead. The        
 Southdown Bus Company can not do      
 anything about this as the bus routes 
 and times are up to the council.      
 ACCIDENTS                             
  There are few accidents. Most of them
 happen at the chicane by Danehill     
 Church involving either cars or       
 motorbikes.                           
                                       </content>
