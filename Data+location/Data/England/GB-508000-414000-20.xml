		<title>20HOME LIFE</title>
		<content> My family has four people in it. One  
 is my sister, the other is Mum and the
 other is my Dad and then me. My house 
 is a bungalow. It has a living room, a
 bathroom and all the things that a    
 house has. We have two cars; one is an
 old Triumph and the other a Ford      
 Granada. My Mum and Dad have made a   
 big drive. My sister is l2. She gets  
 some homework and sometimes she cooks 
 at school or does metal work or       
 woodwork. We all go to Derbyshire or  
 somewhere for our holidays in our     
 caravan. My family is not very good at
 English but my Mum is and my Dad is   
 good at Maths. I have a lot of things 
 to play and do. I have a rope at the  
 bottom of my garden, it is hung on a  
 tree. There are grass-snakes in our   
 garden and I play with them if I can  
 catch them. We get a lot of milk eaten
 by blue-tits.                         </content>
