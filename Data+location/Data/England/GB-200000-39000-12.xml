		<content> Gorran Parish Council is made up 10   
 elected parishoners,representing the  
 wishes of the residents.Elections take
 place every 4 years,there are no      
 restrictions on the number of people  
 standing as nominees.The Parish       
 Council was set up in 1894,previously 
 Parish affairs were settled by wealthy
 landowners.Some of the problems of the
 last century - poor sewerage,cliff    
 falls,water supply - still recur. The 
 present Council levy a rate of 1 to 2p
 in the pound on all rateable          
 properties in the Parish. The rates   
 collected are used for the maintenance
 of footpaths,cemeteries, and other    
 local amenities. The Parish Council   
 works closely with the District       
 Council and Cornwall County Council - 
 they meet on the first Thursday of    
 each month in the Church Rooms.
