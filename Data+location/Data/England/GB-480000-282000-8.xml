		<title>08Family Life- a Child's View</title>
		<content> After surveying a number of adults, we
 thought that it would be a good idea  
 to see how children felt about family 
 life.                                 
 Generally, the children interviewed   
 were happy with the way life carried  
 on in their family.                   
 One girl commented,{"I like my parents
{because they are good to me. They care
{and think a lot of me".}              
 Another said,{"I think that children  
{should have parents to rely on. They  
{can give you love and comfort when you
{are in trouble".                      
 Many of the chidren interviewed were  
 worried for the children whose family 
 life was not as happy as their own.   
 All of them had been punished at one  
 time or another, but none had         
 experienced deliberate cruelty from   
 their parents.                        
                                       </content>
