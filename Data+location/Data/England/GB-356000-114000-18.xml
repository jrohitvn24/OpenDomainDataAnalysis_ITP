		<content>{Religion and local history.}The The   
 earliest known references to a church 
 in Bradford Abbas appear in a Papal   
 Bull of 1163 when Pope Alexander III  
 confirmed to clement. Including Mr.   
 Greene there have been 45 vicars.     
 Three have died before retiring. The  
 church has a choir and a Sunday       
 School. There are 5 people in the     
 choir and 13 in the Sunday School.    
 Sometimes, in the Family Service, the 
 choir hold up pictures. The Family    
 Service is every 3 weeks. Opposite the
 church is the Vicarage but Mr. Greene 
 does not live there. As he is vicar of
 Thornford as well, he lives there.    
 There are 31 pews in church and at the
 back of the church there is an organ. 
 The church has a bell tower.
