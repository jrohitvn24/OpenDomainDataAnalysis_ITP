		<content>  {Twyning Manor}is a victorian        
 building standing in its own grounds  
 of approx. 5 acres. About 12 years ago
 the Manor was sold to a builder after 
 it had been vaccant for some time.    
   The builder gutted the interior but 
 retained the external building and    
 converted it into 13 flats and        
 maisonettes.3 of these are maisonettes
 having their own front doors with two 
 double bedrooms. The rest are in the  
 main building and offer one or two    
 bedroom accomodation. The residents   
 buy their lease hold flat, and are    
 owned by a cross section of the       
 community. Retired couples are the    
 main occupants, but some are owned by 
 people who work abroad and use them as
 a home base. A residents association  
 deals with maintaining the buildings  
 and keeping the grasslands cut in the 
 grounds.                              </content>
