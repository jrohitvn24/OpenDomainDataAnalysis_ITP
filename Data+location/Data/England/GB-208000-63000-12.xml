		<title>12RAILWAYS-BODMIN PARKWAY</title>
		<content> Bodmin Parkway station is situated off
 the A38 to Plymouth. It is 3 miles out
 side of Bodmin and is one of the main 
 stations in Cornwall. In the 1980's   
 the name has been changed from Bodmin 
 Road Station to Bodmin Parkway because
 of the large parking area.            
    The station is fairly old and has  
 recently been simplified with         
 electronics. The old signal box has   
 been taken down and replaced by       
 lights.A bridge crosses high above the
 track to take you from the car-park to
 the ticket office.                    
    The station is in the area of Glynn
 Valley through which the River Fowey  
 runs and it is surrounded by woodland.
 The station also has its own taxi and 
 bus service.
