		<content> Most of this block is made up of      
 farmland and open grazing.the over all
 effect is one of an attractive rural  
 area with small villages and narrow   
 roads.In fact there is a great deal of
 life in the area.The villages have    
 some small industries in them.The area
 is constantly changing and as a result
 of good employment prospects the      
 population is increasing.             
 A large percentage of men in the area 
 work in the big local complexes such  
 as {Westlands Helicopters}in Yeovil { 
{Plesseys Electronics}in Templecombe or
 are stationed at{H.M.S.Heron}at       
 Yeovilton.There is a danger that the  
 villages may become dormitary towns   
 for these places of employment.There  
 has been a lot of concern about this  
 recently.
