		<content> There are deer platforms for          
 observation in the main deer research 
 area which is signposted. Here the    
 public are asked to keep to the       
 pathways. The Research involves       
 studying the habits of deer.          
 To the extreme north of this area in  
 the{Denny Lodge Inclosure}there are   
 deer pens for specific research for   
 Fallow deer. This can involve feeding 
 trials and repellant trials. The      
 latter is to develop chemical sprays  
 and repugnant smelling oils to put on 
 trees. Otherwise deer can seriously   
 damage trees in three ways:           
 1.{Browsing-}Deer eat shoots and buds.
 2.{Fraying-}The males rub their       
    antlers against the trees.         
 3.{Stripping-}In early spring deer    
    strip and eat the bark. If this    
    goes around the trunk the sap      
    cannot rise and the tree dies.     </content>
