		<content>These new houses are all squeezed to-  
gether. When we looked through an empty
one we could see right through the     
rooms and into the back garden. The    
rooms are tiny and the garden is only  
about as big as our classroom,but they 
are still expensive to buy. There are  
allotments across the road from our    
school. We see people digging their    
vegetables. They were once playing     
fields but they were dug up when the   
war started. People with tiny gardens  
can rent them. Nearby is a home for    
handicapped people and there is a      
strange looking fire escape there;a    
big white tube which the handicapped   
people can slide down.
