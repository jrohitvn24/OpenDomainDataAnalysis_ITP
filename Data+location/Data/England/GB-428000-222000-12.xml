		<title>12CHURCHILL CARILLON</title>
		<content>  The Churchill Carillon was formed in 
 1983 when six ladies got together,    
 initially for their own pleasure and  
 amusement, to play the handbells.     
  The bells had been bought for Â£7 in  
 1922 by the PCC for the tower ringers 
 to practise change ringing, and in    
 later years were only used by the     
 school children.   When the school was
 closed in 1981 they were virtually    
 forgotten until the Carillon was      
 formed.  The ringers found that they  
 were in great demand for functions at 
 local groups such as Women's          
 Institutes,old people's clubs,        
 Christmas parties, etc.               
  The Carillon was in fact able to     
 raise Â£500 in one year to have the    
 bells tuned and re-handled, and now   
 play on many occasions for charity.
