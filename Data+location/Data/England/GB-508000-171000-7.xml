		<title>07HANWORTH AIR PARK</title>
		<content> Hanworth was the first airport to be  
 used in Middlesex. It only had grass  
 for the runway and it wasn't just used
 for airplanes instead Autogyro's and  
 Air Ships (including the famous R101) 
 landed there.                         
 During the Second World War they built
 Fairey Fireflys,Hamicar Gliders and   
 many other planes in the hastily      
 constructed hangers/factories.        
 Spitfire planes also flew in to have  
 bomb racks fitted onto their wings.   
 At present the Air Park is used by the
 public for recreational purposes such 
 as football and rugby.Part of our     
 school fields are also on the Air Park
 as is the local swimming baths aud    
 squash courts.                        
 There are still some of the hangers   
 left today as a reminder of recent    
 past.
