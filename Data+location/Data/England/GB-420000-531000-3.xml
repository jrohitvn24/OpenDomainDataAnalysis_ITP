		<content> Local farming is of a mixed type based
 on relatively small family farms as   
 opposed to some of the vast, intensive
 cereal production that one now sees in
 parts of the Midlands. By "family     
 farms" we mean those of approx.200/500
 acres,farmed by the tenant/owner. Land
 formerly owned by the N.C.B. is being 
 sold to the sitting tenants thus the  
 number of owners has increased without
 interference from large scale business
 interests.                            
 Reasons for this type of farming are  
 to be found in the nature of the land;
 undulating, with soil that can vary   
 considerably in quality (see geology) 
 Mixed with fertile areas are enclaves 
 of heavy glacial drift. Add these to_ 
 gether and it can be seen that only a 
 portion of the land is suitable for   
 efficient mechanized farming.
