		<content> We heard a few months ago that        
 Prospect Vale School,built in 1962,   
 were going to have a new roof and     
 double glazing to prevent the noise of
 aeroplanes which is deafening. The    
 school is on the flight path of most  
 planes.Junior 2 classroom has planes  
 going over every two minutes. During  
 story-reading time the teacher has to 
 stop reading aloud until the plane    
 goes over. Even with 150 pupils       
 talking it is hard to break the noise 
 of the aircraft. The new scheme is to 
 have a roof  over three parts of the  
 school and soundproofed windows. The  
 roof will be held up by pillars       
 situated all over the school. The cost
 is Â£250,000. Manchester Airport are   
 paying around Â£200,000 and Stockport  
 Education Committee Â£50,000.It will   
 take approximately 6 months to instal.
 From October 1985 to Msrch,1986.      </content>
