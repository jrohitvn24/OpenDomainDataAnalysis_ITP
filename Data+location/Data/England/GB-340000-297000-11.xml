		<title>11LOWER DARNFORD-HEDGE SURVEY</title>
		<content>   We did a survey of the{hedges}around
{Lower Darnford Farm.}We looked at 42  
 hedges in all.                        
   Most of the hedges were made out of 
 a bank of earth and stones with trees 
 planted along the top.23 had been made
 stockproof with posts and wire.16 were
 only the remains of hedges with       
 occasional trees growing out of the   
 bank.3 wire fences had no trees.Most  
 of the hedges which were stockproof   
 were on the lower ground where the    
 fields were smaller.Higher up the     
 fields had been opened out for sheep  
 to graze.                             
   We looked at one 325m hedge in      
 detail.We found these trees growing   
 there:-{Hawthorn}(55),{Crabapple}(4)  
{Honeysuckle}(3),{Ash}(2),{Willow}(2), 
{Beech}(1),{Hazel}(1),{Blackthorn}(1), 
{Rowan}(1).The Beech tree was massive  
 with a girth of 5m.                   </content>
