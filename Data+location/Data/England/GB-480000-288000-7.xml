		<title>07GOATS AT WILBARSTON</title>
		<content>In Wilbarston there is a small home    
business started four years ago by Mrs.
Lesley Hammock.She breeds goats and    
sells their products.The milk is       
popular with children with allergies   
such as asthma.She also makes cheese   
and yoghurt.The kids are killed for    
meat at six months.There are two herds 
consisting of 20 Anglo Nebian goats,and
a rare breed of Golden Guernsey.Trade  
has grown through word of mouth and    
advertising outside her home.          
Goat farming is not recognised by the  
Ministry of Agriculture,and therefore  
there is no Government help or         
concessional vets fees.Mrs Hammock is  
campaigning to find out the number of  
goat keepers in the country to try to  
attain recognition as farmers.
