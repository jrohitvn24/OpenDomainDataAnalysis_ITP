		<title>02Normanby Hall Country Park-1</title>
		<content> Normanby Park has been owned by the   
 Sheffield family since 1589 and so    
 plays an important part in the local  
 history of the area.In 1703,John      
 Sheffield became a Duke and  the      
 titles he chose were"Normanby and the 
 County of Buckingham".In addition to  
 Normanby Hall the Duke of Buckingham  
 built a fine house at Westminster.    
 Through it his title has become a     
 household word,though his"Buckingham  
 House"has undergone several           
 transformations before becoming       
 today's"Buckingham Palace"he having   
 sold"Buckingham House"to George III   
 in 1762.There are some early          
 inventories of Buckingham House in    
 Scunthorpe Museum archives.           
 In 1962 Normanby Park was leased to   
 Scunthorpe Corporation for 99 years at
 a nominal rent.It attracts visitors   
 from near and far.                    </content>
