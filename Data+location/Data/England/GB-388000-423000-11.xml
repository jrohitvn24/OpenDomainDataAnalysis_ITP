		<title>11After the flood in Cornholme</title>
		<content> In 1982 there was a bad flood and a   
 trail of destruction was left through 
 Cornholme along the Burnley Road and  
 also along the Bacup Road on the other
 side of the moor.                     
 Although no lives were lost in the    
 flood there was considerable damge to 
 property and personal belongings.     
 The damage was restricted to the area 
 along the Burnley Road and resulted in
 one house and a factory having to be  
 demolished. There was also a lot of   
 damage to cars and caravans. The end  
 result of the flood was a trail of mud
 along the street and through the      
 houses.A great effort was made by     
 local services to normalise things and
 a tremendous atmosphere of caring and 
 helping each other was evident after  
 the flood. Work is now in hand to stop
 more flooding and hopefully such a    
 disaster will not be seen again.      </content>
