		<title>13THE GREAT WESTERN SOCIETY</title>
		<content>Where the new car park is, to the West 
of the BR Station, there used to stand,
until 1976, the Provender Store.  This 
stored hay and grain for the 3,000     
horses which used to work on the       
railway.  Brunel's 7'1/4" broad gauge  
track is an historical piece of track  
which members of the GWS have laid.    
All the GWR engines were coloured and  
lettered according to their route and  
group.  For example the Manor's route  
colour was blue and its group letter   
was D.  As you travel up the line from 
Reading to Didcot, you pass some empty 
ground near the track, where the spur  
sidings used to be.  Since the GWS's   
two sheds were re-opened in 1970 the   
Society has gone from strength to      
strength, attracting not only national 
but world-wide support.
