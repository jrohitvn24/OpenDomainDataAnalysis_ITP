		<title>03  The "Lavender Cart".</title>
		<content>                                       
  In Orlingbury we spoke to a gentleman
who remembered about the time before   
the houses were connected to the main  
sewers. He told us that the lavender   
cart was the name given for the cart   
which travelled around the village for 
the men to empty the toilets into.The  
toilets were bucket type and not       
connected to pipes.The lavender cart   
came round on Friday evenings much to  
the embarrassment of the young people  
who were leaving the dance at the same 
time as their father was emptying the  
toilet. Today of course the village has
main sewerage pipes and the problem    
does not arise.                        
                                       
                                       
             o-o-o-o-o-o-o             
                                       
                                       </content>
