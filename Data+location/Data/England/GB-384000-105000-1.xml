		<title>01The Bryanston Estate</title>
		<content>   This block is dominated by the late 
 19th century{Bryanston House}and its  
 Estate. The house is now a boarding   
 school whose grounds occupy a large   
 part of the original estate.          
  {Farming}is the other main activity  
 besides education . There are 3       
 separate farms in the block, rented   
 from the Crown,the landlord after tax 
 (death duties)forced the sale of the  
 estate by the Portman family.         
  {Bryanston Village}is divided into   
 The Cliff &amp; Lower Bryanston. Most of  
 the residents depend on one or other  
 of the two activities for a living,   
 though others work in{Blandford}or    
 elsewhere in Dorset.                  
   There are few amenities in this area
 &amp; the majority of the people depend on
 Blandford for goods and services. For 
 a third of the year the school pupils 
 are on holiday &amp; not in the area.     </content>
