		<title>20THE LIFE OF AN 11 YEAR OLD</title>
		<content> When it is dinnertime I only have a   
 snack and at teatime I have a proper  
 dinner when I have a snack I have a   
 sandwich and when I have dinner I have
 lots of vegetables and pies or meat.  
 My favourite is hamburgers or salad.  
 My favourite hot drink is black coffee
 and my fvourite cold drink is lager.  
 When I go to Denton school I do lots  
 of maths and lots of other things. I  
 think school is very boring because   
 you are always being told what to do. 
 In our class we have 18 children our  
 school is a very old school.
