		<title>08WOOL INDUSTRY</title>
		<content> Many local people used to be employed 
 in the woollen industry. Over the     
 last 20 year there has been a rapid   
 decline. Two mills are still in use   
 one being Dobroyd reopened by John    
 Woodhead Ltd. about 10 years ago. Wool
 is bought from Australia and New      
 Zealand, Nylon comes from ICI. After  
 being dyed at local dyeworks the wool 
 is weighed by colours and the fibres  
 mixed and spun in numerous processes  
 many of the machines being computer   
 controlled. After being tested it is  
 exported all over the world as yarn   
 for loom weaving or knitting machines;
 much is used for making clothes for   
 Marks and Spencers (chain store). 100 
 people are employed including 7 who   
 started on a youth training scheme.   
 Dobroyd Mill covers a vast area and   
 some of it is sub-let to a garage,    
 a food firm and a wallpaper maker.    </content>
