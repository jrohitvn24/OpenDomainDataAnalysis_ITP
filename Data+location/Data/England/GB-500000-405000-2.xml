		<title>02BRIGG RAILWAY STATION</title>
		<content>       The population of Brigg is 5,lOO
 but it is not very well served by its 
 Railway {Station}.  The station is run
 down with no toilets, booking office, 
 nor waiting rooms and is situated on  
 the {Cleethorpes - Sheffield}line via 
 Gainsborough.  Although only 4OO      
 metres from the town centre very few  
 passengers use this facility.         
 Therefore the train service has been  
 reduced to six a day (three in either 
 direction).  The {trains} we surveyed 
 had an average of nine passengers     
 (including the driver).  We discovered
 that the journey {time} from Brigg to 
 Sheffield was one hour twenty-six     
 minutes and Brigg to Cleethorpes was  
 just thirty-seven minutes.  The adult 
 single fare to Sheffield amounted to  
 Â£2.4O and the adult single fare to    
 Cleethorpes totalled Â£l.7O.  On l3th  
 May l985 a lO% increase was authorised</content>
