		<title>14THE CARAVAN SITE, BERKELEY</title>
		<content> The{caravan site}was first inhabited  
 by contractors building{Berkeley Power
{Station}in 1954/55. By 1962 the site  
 had changed hands and a more general  
 range of people lived there. The      
 caravans were given more{substantial  
{bases}in the early 1970's. This led   
 to the site being considered as a more
 permanent place to live. 1978 saw the 
 site expanded to three large fields.  
 The caravans, some now{twin-units,}now
 number over 100 and are usually       
 advertised as{retirement homes.}This  
 means the site population tends to be 
 made up of the older age groups.      
 During the{winter}this type of home is
 prone to being shaken and rattled by  
 stormy winds and during the{summer    
 months they tend to get rather hot and
 stuffy.{Amenities}on the site include 
 a general store and play areas for the
 younger inhabitants.                  </content>
