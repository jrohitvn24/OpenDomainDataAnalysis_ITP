		<title>19CLUBS AND SPORT IN BLOFIELD</title>
		<content>   There are several sporting clubs and
 facilities in Blofield.  This mostly  
 takes place around the Margaret Harker
 hall off the old yarmouth road.  The  
 hall is used as a community centre    
 where many groups meet, such as the   
 over 60s club, a playgroup, the young 
 wives and other similar groups.       
   The hall is also used in the        
 evenings for badminton and beside it  
 there are various sporting facilities.
 There are four grass and one hard     
 tennis court with a small pavilion    
 used by the tennis club.  The         
 recreation ground is used for         
 football, where local league games are
 held on Saturdays.  On the site is    
 also a Scout hut used by the local Sea
 scouts.
