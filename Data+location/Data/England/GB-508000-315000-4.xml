		<title>04OUR POST OFFICE.</title>
		<content> The main line of communication is the 
 Post Office.We also use the telephone 
 for communication.Most people in      
 Thurlby have a telephone in their     
 home.The people who do not have       
 telephones use the modern press button
 telephone boxes.They are in High St,on
 the Green and in Northorpe.Some people
 have friends in different countries so
 we send them letters.The Post Office  
 provides air mail envelopes for these 
 letters.They also have first and      
 second class stamps for ordinary      
 letters.The Post Office also sells    
 National insurance stamps and savings 
 stamps for televisions.They deliver   
 the post to the Post Office at 9.00am 
 and then again at 4.30pm.Then the     
 Postman delivers it to us at          
 9.30am.The Post Offices services are  
 pensions and Family allowances which  
 are collected on Tuesdays.            </content>
