		<title>07Devil's Dyke</title>
		<content>  The dyke was made by some early      
 people to guard a gap between the     
 forest and the fens probably to keep  
 out cattle raiders.It is a high       
 chalk ditch and bank and originally   
 may have had a strong wooden fence on 
 top.It stretches 11 Kilometres from   
 Woodditton to Reach.It has the rare   
 Pasque flower growing on it.It        
 also has lots of trees and quite a few
 birds and animals there too.It has    
 fields on either side so if you want  
 to go on a nature trail or bird       
 watching,the Dyke is a good place to  
 go.Lots of people take their dogs for 
 walks there.In the winter if it snows 
 it is lots of fun to play in the      
 drifts there.
