		<title>10Farming around Snape, Yorks.</title>
		<content>   Snape village is in the centre of a 
 region of mixed farming.There are 16  
 farms, just over half keeping some    
 cows and fattening beast for          
 market.Sheep are kept on 12 farms.Pigs
 are kept on smallholdings in the      
 village.Barley is the main crop, with 
 oil-seed rape and wheat not grown as  
 extensively as in previous years.     
       {East End Farm.}                
   My name is James,I am 10 years old  
 and I live on a farm in the village.We
 are growing a fairly new crop called  
 typhon, which is a cross between a    
 cabbage and a turnip.We milk about 27 
 cows, also we have some beast which we
 are fattening for market, and heifers 
 of which the Friesians are kept for   
 milking and the others go to market.We
 have a sheepdog called Shep and we    
 grow hay to feed the cattle in winter.
