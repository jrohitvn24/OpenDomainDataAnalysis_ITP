		<content>     In the steep sided valley of the  
 Washford River in the North of this   
 Block there is an important{Forestry  
{Commission Plantation.  }This provides
{employment}for as many as 20 people.  
     It covers about about 8,000 acres 
 and the trees are planted at a density
 of about 800 to the acre.   It is a   
{coniferous}plantation with trees like 
{Sitka Spruce and Douglas Fir}being    
 very important.                       
     When we went to the Forest we saw 
 lots of big{ants}and ants nests.      
 There are some{squirrels}but they are 
 all grey squirrels because the red    
 squirrels have been chased out of     
 their territory by the grey ones.     
     There are{fallow deer, roe deer   
{and red deer.  }They have to control  
 the numbers of red deer so they don't 
 spoil the trees or the neighbouring   
 farmers crops.                        </content>
