		<content>{Knutsford Road Methodist Church}is 85 
 years old.  All the floor and ceiling 
 has been replaced recently because of 
 dry rot.  Two more rooms have been    
 built.  An old storeroom has been     
 turned into a Sunday School room.  The
 alteration is costing Â£37,000.  Before
 its alteration it held 180 people but 
 it is now hoped it will hold 200.  In 
 the last 5 years Focus Club, a        
 Fellowship Club and choir have been   
 formed.  The Reverend I. Hall believes
 that the church is for 3 things:      
{To worship God, To tell people, all   
{people, the good news of how God cares
{for them, To serve people in any way  
{possible.}                            
 There is one thing all 3 churches     
 agree to: the church plays an         
 important role in the everyday life of
 Holmes Chapel.
