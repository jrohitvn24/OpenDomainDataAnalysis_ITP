		<title>12TRANSPORT IN A VILLAGE</title>
		<content>    There are some buses through       
 Yeaveley. The buses take people to the
 nearby towns on market days. On       
 Wednesday a bus goes to Uttoxter, on  
 Friday a bus goes to Derby and on     
 Thursday and Saturday buses go to     
 Ashbourne.                            
    The transport that most people need
 is a car or motorbike because the     
 people have to go to work out of the  
 village.                              
    The transport that girls and boys  
 in this village have is bikes and     
 horses.                               
    The farmers have tractors and      
 landrovers.
