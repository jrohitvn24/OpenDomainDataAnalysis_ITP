    We surveyed the school to find out 
 the occupations of the children's     
 parents. We found out that out of 64  
 children we interviewed,{18.75%}of    
 their fathers worked at Silverton     
 paper mill. Then we worked out that   
{6.25%}of the fathers worked on farms. 
 The third most popular job, office    
 work, came out as{4.7%.               
                                       
    With the mothers' occupations the  
 most common job was that of housewife.
 We worked out the percentage  as{     
{29.7%.}Nurses, and the four people    
 who worked with foods, had the same   
 percentage of{6.25%.}So now we have   
 found out that being a housewife is   
 the most popular job for mothers but  
 with fathers, working in the paper    
 mill was the most common job.
