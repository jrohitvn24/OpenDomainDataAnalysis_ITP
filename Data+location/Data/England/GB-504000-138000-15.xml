		<content>{  Scout and Guide movement            
  The non-stop activities at the brick 
 Scout "hut" and Guide room show the   
 movement's strength in the year in    
 which it celebrates 85 &amp; 75 years,    
 respectively, since foundation.       
  Five Brownie Packs, four Guide       
 Companies, Cub Packs and Scout Troups 
 meet each week. Older children, aged  
 15+, join a mixed group of Venture    
 Scouts who enjoy canoeing and outdoor 
 pursuits.                             
  We saw Brownies entertaining elderly 
 friends with tea, stories and poems.  
 Cubs gave a grand howl and played ball
 games. All sleeves showed many badges.
  {St.John's ambulance                 
  Other children become cadets with the
 St. John's Brigade and learn first aid
 and other ways of helping people. They
 provide care at many local functions.
