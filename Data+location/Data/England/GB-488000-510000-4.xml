		<content>  The most recent change has been the  
 opening of the{New Road Bridge,}by{The
{Marquis of Normanby}in 1980.Traffic is
 now able to bypass the town centre.A  
 controversial road junction at one end
 of the bridge is causing much local   
 discussion.The town's old{swing bridge
 is being refurbished.                 
  The new{hospital}was opened in 1977  
 on the site of the old hospital.The   
 rubble was used to build the new{     
{yachting marina.}This marina changed  
 the shape of the River Esk by creating
 a weir.                               
  A new{industrial estate} on the east 
 side has opened up places for small   
 industry.Whitby's first purpose built 
 supermarket was opened by 'Hintons' in
 1981.A new{reservoir,}built behind St.
 Hilda's Anglican School has now become
 operational. Four new{private housing 
{estates}have been built.              </content>
