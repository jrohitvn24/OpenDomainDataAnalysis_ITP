 over 20 years ago.It is situated near 
 the centre of the village and is the  
 meeting place for several             
 organisations.                        
 The Women's Institute, Stonegate Youth
 Club, Badminton Club and The Mothers  
 and Toddlers Group are all based at   
 the Village Hall.                     
 There are Adult Education classes in  
 upholstery and keep fit.              
 The local primary school,not having a 
 hall or gymnasium of its own,uses the 
 Village Hall for physical education   
 lessons and concerts.                 
 From time to time village activities  
 take place in the hall,including barn 
 dances,village concerts and flower    
 shows.                                
 The hall is also available for people 
 wishing to organise a disco ,party or 
 wedding reception.                    </content>
