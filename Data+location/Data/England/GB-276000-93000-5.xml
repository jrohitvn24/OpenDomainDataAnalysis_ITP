		<title>05Farming - Livestock</title>
		<content> The livestock of the area are mainly  
 sheep, which have been predominant for
 hundreds of years. These are closely  
 followed by beef stock and dairy herds
 of cattle. Many of the smaller farmers
 have recently changed from dairy to   
 fatstock as this is proving more      
 economic for them. The milk from the  
 dairy cows is pumped directly into a  
 sterilised tank and collected daily   
 from the farms. There are also 2      
 goat-keepers in the area who sell     
 goats' milk and the cheese made from  
 it. There is one moth farm where      
 rare moths are bred and the larvae    
 exported to many parts of the world.  
 Commercial beekeeping, horticultural  
 and garden centres also thrive.
