		<content> In Watford the game{Hom Pom}is played 
 quite a lot. The game itself is       
 similar to hide and seek but slightly 
 different. The rules are something    
 like this.                            
                                       
 A few people hide and one person      
 seeks. The                            
 person who seeks has to count up to a 
 certain number. When he finishes      
 counting he or she has to start to    
 seek. Whenever a person who is seeking
 finds another person he or she has to 
 run to the post and say,"Hom Pom 1 2 3
 I see (whoever) hiding behind         
 (where-ever)." When everybody runs to 
 the post, if there is anybody who gets
 caught, or is the last to be caught   
 then they are "on" in the next game.{ 
{Hom Pom}is played a lot because there 
 are lots of good places to hide       
 behind.                               </content>
