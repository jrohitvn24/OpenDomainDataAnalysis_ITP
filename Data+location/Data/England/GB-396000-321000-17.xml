		<title>17SHOPPING:GT.HAYWOOD VILLAGE.</title>
		<content>  On the 7th of June 1985,we did a     
survey on shopping for the Domesday    
Project in Great Haywood.  We          
interviewed 20 people outside the      
shops.                                 
 We found out that most people used the
village shops for groceries,provisions 
and other items.                       
  A lot of people did not use the      
village shops for their main weekly    
shopping.  They mainly used the super- 
markets because they have a larger     
choice and they are a lot cheaper.The  
most used supermarkets are Tesco and   
Sainsburys.                            
  We think that it is important that   
the shops in the village should stay   
open because in the future petrol and  
the cost of bus fares will go up in    
price.  Many people might not be able  
to afford to get to town,so it is very 
important that they should stay open.  </content>
