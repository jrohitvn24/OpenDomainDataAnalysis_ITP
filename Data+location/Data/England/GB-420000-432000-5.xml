		<title>05FAMILY LIFE-Children's view</title>
		<content>    In our families we have just our   
 immediate relatives living with us.   
 None of our parents have been either  
 divorced or separated.All our parents 
 work at sometime in the week and      
 sometimes,if there is a young child   
 involved,a relative will look after   
 it.Whenever possible we all get out   
 with the family to clubs,pubs,to visit
 relatives,go shopping or go on a trip 
 to the country or the seaside.        
 Sometimes,if one member of the family 
 is at work,the rest of the family will
 still go out.We all like our families 
 very much.One of us is an only child  
 and would like other brothers or      
 sisters,and some of us would prefer to
 have younger brothers or sisters      
 instead.                              
    But we are happy with our families.
 Everything is stable.
