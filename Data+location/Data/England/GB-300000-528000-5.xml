		<title>05SEATON CARNIVAL</title>
		<content> Seaton carnival, dating from the      
 beginning of this century,is held on  
 the second Saturday ofJune.           
 Preparation begins in December. The   
 commitee of 12 will spend Â£1500.      
 On the day, the judges give prizes for
 the best queen's float, the best      
 tableau,the open float from outside   
 Seaton,and many other novelty entries.
 There is a prize for the best overall 
 entry, and for the best entertainment.
 There is a strict hierarchy amongst   
 the queens, who graduate from Gipsy to
 Carnival to retiring queen to         
 Britannia.                            
 Dancing exhibitions and many bands    
 make this a very joyful and noisy     
 affair enjoyed hugely by all.         
 Over 1000 free teas are handed out to 
 children and on nearby Jackson St.    
 field there is a fair.
