		<title>10A FARMER'S DAY IN HAMSTERLEY</title>
		<content>  The work of a farmer varies from     
 season to season,the busiest being    
 February to April when the calves and 
 lambs are born,usually between 5.00   
 and 7.00 a.m.At this time I start work
 at 6.00 instead of the usual 8.00.a.m.
  My days throughout the year are      
 filled from early morning to lunch    
 checking the sheep,feeding the hens   
 and stock and cleaning the byres.After
 lunch I do odd jobs such as manure    
 spreading,fencing and machine         
 maintenance.I once again check the    
 sheep and stock before tea.About 6.00 
 I make a final check of stock,feed and
 bed up for the night.                 
  In the evenings I watch T.V. with my 
 family,occasionally attend social     
 gatherings and dances in the Village  
 Hall or do home maintenace.I live in a
 modernised farmhouse,3 miles from the 
 village with my wife and 2 children.  </content>
