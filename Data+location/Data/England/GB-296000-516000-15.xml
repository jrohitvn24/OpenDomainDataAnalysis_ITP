		<title>15WHITEHAVEN COASTGUARD.</title>
		<content> Whitehaven is the second oldest       
 Coastguard Station in Britain.It was  
 started in 1822.Mr Russell, who is the
 Sector Officer, has to cover an area  
 from Millom to Annan and is helped by 
 70 Auxiliaries.The danger areas are St
 Bees Head and St Bees cliffs.The      
 busiest time of year for a Coastguard 
 is in Summer because people go        
 swimming and get carried out to sea by
 the current at St Bees.Our Coastguard 
 still  uses a Breeches Buoy and goes  
 for practices off St Bees Cliffs.Our  
 Coastguard also has certificates from 
 the R.S.P.B and from the R.S.P.C.A for
 saving dogs,cats,seagulls and many    
 more animals.He is also responsible   
 for stranded whales,obnoxious         
 waste,oil pollution and the safety of 
 buildings on the foreshore.
