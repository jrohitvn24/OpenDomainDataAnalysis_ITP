		<title>18SUPERNATURAL AT WYDDIAL</title>
		<content>  Precis of account by Gerish 1921.    
 Variant of similar tales elsewhere.   
  At Cave Gate was a disused chalk pit 
 from which the Devil's Hole led by a  
 tunnel to Anstey Castle dungeons.     
 Anyone entering it would not emerge   
 alive. In 1870 after drinking at the  
 Chequers (Anstey) the blind fiddler,  
 George,swore he would go the length of
 the tunnel.At Cave Gate,down the hole 
 went George tugging his dog on a lead.
 The villagers followed the sound of   
 his fiddle beneath their feet halfway 
 to the castle when there was a shriek,
 the fiddling stopped.They ran back to 
 the entrance to see the tailless      
 singed dog dash out and vanish.George 
 was not seen again.Next day they      
 filled in the hole.About 1880 an iron 
 door was found under water set in the 
 side of the castle moat.In 1904 part  
 of the Cave Gate tunnel was explored. </content>
