		<title>04TRADE IN SHREWLEY AREA</title>
		<content>                                       
Shop trade in the area was very basic. 
There were only a few shops situated in
our area. One of the shops was a small 
newsagents and the other was a small   
grocers which had a post office        
inside. One of the advantages of only  
having a few shops would be that most  
people would depend on the shops for   
goods.  In the area there was a small  
mobile shop which travelled around     
the Shrewley area several times a week.
Here is its rota.                      
                                       
FISHMONGER  came once a week.          
GROCERS     came twice a week.         
GENERAL     came three times a week.   
                                       
Other trade includes milk.The Milk Mar-
keting Board tankers come regularly to 
pick up milk from the farms.
