		<content> Along side almost every{road}and{lane 
 in the country are regularly spaced   
 poles which carry overhead cables.    
 Some of these are used for{electricity
 which is one of the main sources of   
 power.   It is used for{lighting}of   
 all properties both private and public
 and for the illumination of the roads.
 Most of these lights have a switch    
 sensitive to daylight which turns the 
 light on as the dusk gathers and off  
 again in the morning.   Some of these 
 lights stay on at all times of        
 darkness.   Provision of such lighting
 has enabled much more evening activity
 to take place than when there was only
{gas-}or indeed no lighting.   Power in
 the home allows for the use of        
{heating, cooking}and{refrigerators,}as
 well as{washing machines, cleaners,   
{sewing machines}and many other        
 applications.   Few homes are without.</content>
