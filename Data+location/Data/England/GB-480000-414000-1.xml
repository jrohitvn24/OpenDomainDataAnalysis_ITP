		<content> The whole area of block 0480 0414 is  
 flat and very low-lying,covered by    
 farmland and occupied by two          
 villages,Eastoft and Luddington.They  
 are situated in the North of an area  
 known as the Isle of Axholme which was
 a marshy swampland lived in by        
 wild-fowlers and surrounded by 4      
 rivers,the Trent to the East,the      
 Idle,the Torn and the Don.The areas   
 where the villages are situated are on
 slightly higher ground than the rest  
 of the land which is why people       
 settled there.                        
     In the late 1620's the area was   
 drained by a Dutchman,Cornelius       
 Vermuyden and there was almost a      
 mini-civil war because the inhabitants
 wanted the area to stay as it         
 was.However,the troubles were         
 eventually over and the area has      
 become fertile farmland.              </content>
