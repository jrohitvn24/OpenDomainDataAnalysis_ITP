  Play times....Before school 8.30-9.00
  Mid-morning 10.20-10.40,supervised by
two teachers.Lunch time 12.00-12.30    
1.00-1.15, supervised by part time     
  Boys and girls do very different     
things. In the summer older boys play  
cricket in the playground in winter it 
is football. In summer, if the rec.    
is dry, we can go out there. This is   
good because  the playground gets very 
crowded and little ones get knocked    
over.                                  
  Every year there is a craze for      
playing marbles about Easter time and  
conkers in the autumn. Now the craze   
is Tennis because Wimbledon has        
started. Little boys seem to charge    
about and fight each other all the     
time.                                  
  Classes take turns to play on the    
climbing frame and in the fort.        </content>
