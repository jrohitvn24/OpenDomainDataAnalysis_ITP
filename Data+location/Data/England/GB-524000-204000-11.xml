		<title>11A school day at Brookmans Pk</title>
		<content>    On Monday morning it's hard to get 
 me up and get ready for school. I     
 wash, dress and have toast for        
 breakfast. After putting my coat and  
 shoes on, my Mum drives me to school  
 in her blue Mini Metro.It's not very  
 far to walk but I never have enough   
 time to walk. After the whistle goes  
 in the playground we all line up for  
 assembly. The whole school goes into  
 the hall.We usually have a story and a
 hymn. Then we go back to our class for
 lessons. We have maths first and after
 morning break English.Sometimes we do 
 Science or topic when we can write    
 about anything we like.               
    At lunchtime we have a school meal.
 Most people have it but some bring a  
 packed lunch.After school is over I go
 home, have tea and watch television.  
 My favourite programme is'The A Team'.
