		<content> The children who have compiled the    
 material for this survey all go to    
 Lomgden Primary School which has 114  
 pupils on roll and four assistant     
 teachers and a headmaster.            
   The school is a church aided school 
 and recently the Governors voted to   
 keep the school's aided status and    
 this was supported by the local       
 Parochial Church Council.             
   The school has four classes and is  
 housed in buildings which were opened 
 in 1954. The old school buildings,    
 dating back to the 1860's, are now a  
 private dwelling approximately 100    
 yards from the new site.              
  The new buildings were opened in 1954
  when the neighbourhood schools at    
 Pulverbatch and Hook-a-gate were      
 closed and the old school building was
 too small to house the amalgamated    
 pupil population.                     </content>
