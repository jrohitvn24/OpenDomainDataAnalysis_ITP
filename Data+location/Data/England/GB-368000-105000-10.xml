		<title>10WHY I MOVED TO THIS AREA</title>
		<content> by Andrew Johnston                    
                                       
 We moved to this area because it was a
 bigger farm and dad wanted to keep    
 more cows. Our previous farm near     
 Bridport had only twenty acres and we 
 only had thirty cows so we bought     
 another twelve acres not far from the 
 farm and every year we bought some    
 grass keep. Our present farm is       
 seventy acres large and we milk       
 between 50-60 cows.And also we live by
 the road whereas at our other farm we 
 lived down a stone track. Another     
 thing I like up here is that there is 
 a private road which goes to three    
 other farms and we are allowed to ride
 our bikes down there. We need the road
 to get to most of our fields and we   
 have to pay money to the council for  
 the use of it.
