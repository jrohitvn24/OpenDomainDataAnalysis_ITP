 of the Bramhope square is grassland.  
 Approximately 40% is maintained       
 pasture,11% enclosed rough grazing,   
 while 18% is uncultivated non-woodland
 grassland.About 15% of the land is    
 given over to growing fodder root     
 crops for winter feed.Houses &amp; gardens
 account for about 8% of the land      
 cover, a large proportion of the      
 square considering the population of  
 Bramhope is 3395 people.A large       
 recreational area called 'Golden Acre 
 Park' incorporating cultivated        
 gardens, woodland,rough grassland and 
 a lake accounts for about 3% of the   
 square.The remaining land cover       
 consists of woodland,twice as much    
 deciduous as coniferous and two       
 working quarries where sandstone is   
 extracted.
