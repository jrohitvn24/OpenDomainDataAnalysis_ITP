		<content>   The school's catchment area is the  
 parish of Withington although some    
 children attend from the neighbouring 
 villages of Compton Abdale, Hazleton  
 and Shipton.                          
   At the age of eleven children sit   
 their "J.4 Test" to determine which   
 secondary school they may attend.     
 Depending on the results of this test 
 children transfer to either Westwoods 
 Grammar School at Northleach or to    
 Charlton Kings Secondary Modern School
 Cheltenham.                           
   In September 1986 the Charlton Kings
 School will become a comprehensive    
 school. Discussions are still taking  
 place about the future of Westwoods   
 School which may be almalgamated with 
 a school at Bourton to become a       
 comprehensive school as well.Children 
 are taken to both schools by buses    
 provided by the Education Authority.  </content>
