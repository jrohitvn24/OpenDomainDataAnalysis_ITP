		<title>06Buildings in Woburn</title>
		<content> The best known of the buildings in the
 Village of Woburn is the{Town Hall.}  
 This was designed by the eminent      
 Victorian architect{Edward Blore}(who 
 designed the frontage of Buckingham   
 Palace) on commission to{John 6th Duke
{of Bedford}to replace an earlier      
 building demolished in 1830. The Town 
 Hall, built in{gothic}style,is now    
 used for a variety of activities      
 including monthly bingo and a youth   
 club. Blore worked on other           
 commissions for the Duke including    
 rebuilding the church tower.          
{Staunton House,}which incorporates    
 traditional Dutch Gables, originated  
 from the will of Sir Francis Staunton 
 in 1635. The original almshouses were 
 converted to flatlets for senior      
 citizens in 1968. They are much in    
 demand but priority is given to Woburn
 residents.                            </content>
