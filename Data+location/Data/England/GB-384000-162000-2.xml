		<content> Broughton Gifford derives its name    
 from the saxon Broctun-a farm by a    
 brook and from the family name of John
 Gifford, who purchased it in 1269 from
 Walter de Dunstanville. Holts name    
 derives from hillwood perhaps due to  
 the large oakwood which once spread   
 from Broughton and Chalfield towards  
 Holt. Chalfield comes from cold or    
 chilly field. The area was part of the
 land granted to Ethelred in 1001 AD.  
 to the monastery of Shaftesbury so    
 that "the nuns might have a safe      
 retreat from the ravages of the       
 Danes".                               
 TRADITION                             
 Broughton Common, which covers 28     
 acres, is traditionally known as      
 Ganderland and those living around it 
 as Ganders because at one time most   
 families kept geese. Many houses still
 have goose-holes in the garden wall.  </content>
