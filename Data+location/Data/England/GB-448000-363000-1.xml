 and questioned as to the type of      
 religious beliefs that they held,the  
 results being{Church of England}, and 
{Methodism.On}being questioned as to   
 whether they attended church          
 regularly,on the whole the answer was 
 "No".The only regular attender was the
 Vicar of one of the churches.One of   
 the other people who attended only did
 so at Christenings,Weddings and       
 Funerals.On the whole,people were     
 uninterested or could not care less.  
 There is an active Young Men's        
 Christian Association thriving in the 
 area which provides much entertainment
 and many activities for the youth in  
 the area.Some people although non     
 attenders support the church by making
 donations of money for the upkeep of  
 the church and for building repairs.  
 About 100 people attended services.   </content>
