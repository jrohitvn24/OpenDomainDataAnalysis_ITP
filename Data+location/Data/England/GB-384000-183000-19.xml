		<title>19CHILDREN'S HOBBIES</title>
		<content>  One of my hobbies is{sailing}.We sail
 on the Avon at Chippenham, zigzagging 
 up and down.The instructor shows you  
 how to rig and sail a boat. The club  
 owns 10 boats and the members own a   
 lot more. They are mostly made of     
 wood.I'm normally allowed to steer but
 it's not easy on the river and last   
 time I ran aground.It's easier at sea!
  I collect stamps , being a member of 
 the{"Stamp Bug Club}.It doesn't have a
 headquarters but they send a magazine 
 every other month and if you show your
 membership card you can get in places 
 free.If you send off for new stamps   
 they send them on the first day.      
  I'm only 11 but I play{Golf}using  my
 Dad's old set of clubs at Westonbirt  
 Golf Club where we have to go round   
 twice becuase there are only 9 holes. 
 Sometimes we play with people we      
 haven't met before so making friends. </content>
