		<title>04GAMES CHILDREN PLAY</title>
		<content> The children that live in the village 
 usually get together and play football
 on the green. They might use their    
 jackets or jumpers as goal posts, or  
 they might play cricket. One of them  
 would probably have a cricket set,    
 most of them are quite good at both   
 sports. They also play on their BMX   
 bikes which are special bikes for     
 doing stunts (wheelies, jumps, etc)   
 They ride them on the green. Sometimes
 they might go to somebody else's house
 who doesn't live in Frant probably on 
 their bikes.                          
 I usually play on my BMX bike as well,
 in my garden or along a path at the   
 bottom of my garden.                  
 I might go and find a tree to climb   
 (along the path or somewhere.)        
 Note:a BMX is a special bike for doing
 stunts(jumps,wheelies etc)
