 In peoples homes there are rooms which
 are sometimes called either the

 living room there is normally a       
 television set, a three piece         
 suite,some kind of table either for   
 dining or display and a small coffee  
 table. The other popular items are    
 plants, videos and music centres and  
 various ornaments. This living room is
 usually the most comfortable room in  
 the home where all the family meet    
 often to eat, to entertain or to just 
 sit and watch the television. Many    
 people take great pride in making     
 their living rooms warm and           
 comfortable.
