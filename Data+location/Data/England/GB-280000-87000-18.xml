		<title>18CHILDREN'S POEMS I'D LIKE</title>
		<content> I'd like to be a pianist,             
 A pianist,that's me!                  
 Strumming up the keyboard,            
 Playing every key.                    
 But when it comes to practising,      
 My motivation fails.                  
 Cos Mum keeps on shouting,            
 "Please play those scales!"           
 I like to play good tunes the best,   
 I'm sure I'll make it yet.            
 But to be a famous pianist,           
 I'll have to do the rest.             
                                       
 I'd like to be a model                
  because of the clothes they wear.    
 I'd like to be a hostess              
  for making the coffee there.         
 I'd like to be a dressmaker           
  to make things bright and clean.     
 I'd like to be a swimmer              
  to swim a little race. But I'd still 
 like to be ,My plain,plain self.      </content>
