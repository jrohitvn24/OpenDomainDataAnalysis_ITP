		<title>05RECREATION FOOTBALL LUTON</title>
		<content>I play for a football club called      
Lewsey Centre.  We play at St. Martin's
Junior School. When I played in the    
9-11 section there were 2 divisions, we
played in the first against St.Josephs,
Auckland, Hawthorns, Ramridge,         
Westoning and Sacred Heart. The first  
division was from the first two teams  
in each of several groups. We also won 
a 5-a-side tournament at Marsh House   
and we were runners-up to one at       
Millvale School. We all won little     
trophies and the team shared a big     
trophy. In the league St.Josephs were  
first, Auckland 2nd, Hawthorns 3rd, and
Lewsey 4th. At the end of the season   
there is an Awards Night I was 2nd     
player of the year. We hope to play a  
Bicester team in August.Next year the  
Bernard Chiltern Sunday League will    
have 3 divisions new teams include     
Totternhoe  and Woodstock.             </content>
