       The John Wilkinson School is on 
 the outskirts of Broseley opposite a  
 new housing estate called the         
 Tileries.It opened in 1976. There are 
 159 children aged 5 to 11.There are 6 
 classes.                              
       We don't have a teacher for     
 each subject but we change teachers   
 every year.As well as lessons we have 
 lots of clubs after school which are  
 free. At the clubs we can do different
 sports, handicrafts,science,music,    
 drama,gym or cooking.                 
       At the end of the year the      
 children who are leaving have a party.
       Every year there is a school    
 trip, some of the places the school   
 has been  are Switzerland,Belguim,The 
 Shetlands,on the canal,Ludlow,London  
 and this Summer a week camping in     
 Wales. We also have day visits.       </content>
