		<title>05Low Farm, Sharlston</title>
		<content>  Our farm has 150 acres. Our farmhouse
 is 412 years old. The actual farm was 
 built in the reign of Elizabeth 1. On 
 our farm we have 2 cottages and 1     
 bungalow. We grow potatoes, turnips,  
 mangels, wheat and barley. We have a  
 paddock which we use for making hay   
 and we have a clover field. We also   
 keep bullocks, a horse and three dogs.
 We have 3 tractors, 3 combines and 4  
 trailers. Our farm is not the same as 
 any of the farms around us. We have a 
 top shed, potato store, bottom yard,  
 calves shed. We also use machinery    
 such as a baler and spinner, tractors 
 and trailers.
