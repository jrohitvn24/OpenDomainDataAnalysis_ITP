		<content>   Large numbers of immigrants started 
 to arrive in Bolton in the 1950's.    
 They chose Bolton because there were  
 jobs for them in the cotton mills.    
   Of the 260,000 people who live in   
 Bolton,about 20,000 belong to ethnic  
 minority groups. The largest group,   
 about 15,000,have come from the       
 Gujarat State in India.In addition    
 there are quite large groups of West  
 Indians,2000+,and Pakistanis 2000.    
 There are also much smaller groups of 
 Iranians,Bangladeshis,Chinese,Irish   
 and Polish.Bolton has appointed a team
 of six community relations officers to
 help the minority groups with their   
 problems.The main problems are with   
 language,housing and jobs.They arrange
 language classes in homes and schools 
 to give the Asian ladies a chance to  
 learn English.They are available to   
 help in legal matters when requested. </content>
