		<title>12ADULT EDUCATION IN STOPSLEY</title>
		<content> In Stopsley Community College there   
 are all kinds of day classes from     
 painting and sewing to gardening and  
 languages. The adults use the school  
 facilities when they are not needed by
 the school. The classes are mainly for
 the retired and elderly but the age of
 students runs from 16 year old        
 students to the over 80's. One woman  
 started a course and was unable to    
 finish it because she had died. Some  
 of the classes are for people to      
 improve their skills for things in the
 home,or painting, or gardening. If you
 wanted to take certain subjects for   
 examinations you would have to go to a
 separate specialist college. You can  
 however study basic languages like    
 Spanish, French and German.
