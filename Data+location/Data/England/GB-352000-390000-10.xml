		<title>10A RETIRED MINER TALKS TO US.</title>
		<content>     Mr. Wilkinson, who was a miner    
 from the age of fourteen, came to talk
 to us about mining.  He showed us a   
 map of the underground mines and it   
 showed us that the whole of our area  
 is built over coal mines.  Although   
 Clock Face coal mine has closed down  
 there are two coal mines just outside 
 our block and within walking distance 
 of our school.  Many of our fathers   
 work in the coal mines.               
     Mr. Wilkinson told us the history 
 of mining and how it has changed over 
 the years.  He used to work with      
 pit-ponies, but they don't use them   
 now.  Today there are better safety   
 standards.  He showedus the filters   
 which tell how much coal dust is in   
 the area and also slides of machines  
 which pumps water into the mines to   
 clear the dust.These machines are big 
 and have to be built underground.     </content>
