		<title>03Ecology of the Downs 2</title>
		<content>    Beachy Head marks the starting     
 point of the chalk hills - the South  
 Downs - which stretch westward away   
 from Eastbourne. The Downs are covered
 with a thin layer of soil between 6   
 &amp; 12 inches in depth and occasionally 
 with clay to a greater depth. This    
 chalk has, in the past, been a source 
 of flint used for both building and   
 tools. The chalk cliffs that form the 
 shore-line are receding at the rate of
 30-40cms a year on average. The cliffs
 do not recede gradually but large     
 chunks fall away after storms about 2 
 or 3 times a year.                    
    The most abundant animal now living
 on the Downs is the rabbit, which     
 burrows throughout the topsoil and    
 also keeps down the level of plants;  
 there are also badgers and weasels,   
 while birds include kestrels, barn    
 owls and sky-larks.                   </content>
