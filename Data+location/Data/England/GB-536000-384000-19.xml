 In our school we discussed the        
 occupations of our parents.Our fathers
 are builders,teachers,aircraft        
 technicians,farmers and barmen.Some   
 are bank,business or factory managers.
 We have a dentist,a joiner and        
 hospital and council workers.Some     
 fathers are salesmen,auctioneers,     
 foresters or car mechanics.Some       
 mothers go out to work part-time or   
 full-time.They are teachers,milk      
 ladies,shopkeepers,cashiers,physio-   
 therapists,hairdressers,secretaries,  
 salesladies and gardeners.Most mothers
 are housewives especially those who   
 have young children.Parents have to   
 travel to the towns to work.They      
 travel to Louth,Grimsby,Scunthorpe,   
 Immingham,Mablethorpe and Skegness.   
 Some parents are self-employed.Luckily
 no father is unemployed.              </content>
