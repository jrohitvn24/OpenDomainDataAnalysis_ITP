		<title>013 SOUTH NORTHANTS VILLAGES</title>
		<content>  This block covers some woodland,     
 fertile farming land and mainly grain,
 but some mixed farming. Many of the   
 dwellings are local ironstone, the    
 three villages are linked under the   
 care of one rector each have their own
 church, Parish Council and Parish     
 Church Council. Several small family  
 farms employ few full time workers,   
 one large grain farm is highly        
 mechanised. A small amount of part    
 time, mainly domestic work, is        
 provided. Most villagers commute to   
 nearby towns, some go as far as       
 London. Many cottages have been       
 combined to make pleasant modern      
 homes. There is a small industrial    
 estate at Hitchborough, within the    
 garden centre is a long established   
 pipe factory. The villages are allowed
 only infilling buildings this         
 retaining a precious area of land,    </content>
