		<title>13ROSSINGTON  SWIMMING  CLUB</title>
		<content>     The Rossington Swimming           
 Association meet as a club every      
 weekday except Tuesday. Members range 
 from six year olds to adults, as a    
 person's swimming improves he/she is  
 moved to a higher group. Badges can be
 won at each level.                    
     The swimming groups start at the  
 three foot depth and work their way up
 to the ten foot depth as they improve.
 The advanced group practise length    
 swimming for speed and style they     
 therefore use the whole of the pool.  
     The Rossington Swimming Pool was  
 opened in 1966.  The pool itself      
 measures 25 metres by 10 metres.  The 
 Rossington swimming baths are opened  
 to the public afternoons and weekends.
 The baths are also used by local      
 schools and by the R.A.F. at          
 Finningley for survival training.
