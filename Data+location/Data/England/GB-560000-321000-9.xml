		<title>09Drainage in King's Lynn</title>
		<content> Drainage in the area is overseen by   
 the Snettisham drainage board.The     
 drainage has been greatly improved in 
 recent years.The 1600 mile bank, the  
 original sea defence system, is now   
 mostly ploughed up.The northern half  
 of the area drains in a general north 
 west direction,through a series of new
 dykes to the "New Cut", which         
 eventually flows out through a sluice 
 to the River Ouse.This has been       
 greatly improved to become the Lynn   
 channel.The south half of the area    
 drains through to a dyke which follows
 the course of the A1078,flowing under 
 the road by the Skoda factory,across  
 and out through to the Ouse near the  
 Dow chemical works.
