		<title>19SUNDAY DINNER</title>
		<content> Sunday dinner is the special family   
 meal of the week.The family can eat   
 together because very few people are  
 at work on Sunday.We usually have     
 dinner between two and three o'clock. 
 My mum buys one big piece of pork,lamb
 or beef on Friday or Saturday.        
 When she has cooked it on Sunday she  
 will cut it into pieces for all the   
 family to have with roast potatoes and
 vegetables.This is followed by a      
 sweet,perhaps apple crumble and       
 custard.If the weather is hot we may  
 have our dinner in the early evening. 
 Sunday is a family day.My sister      
 prepares the table for dinner and     
 after dinner I help to wash up.My     
 auntie and uncle and cousin come to   
 our house at about four-thirty or we  
 may visit them.
