		<content>     THE VILLAGE OF CHOLESBURY:        
 Cholesbury was originally an Iron Age 
 settlement.Most of the houses are     
 clustered round the Common.The 17th   
 century houses have                   
 foot-scrapers.There is a moated       
 encampment covering about 10 acres    
 next to the medieval church.The       
 boundary between Cholesbury and       
 Hawridge is marked by an ancient stone
 erected in 1828.                      
 Most people before they came to       
 Cholesbury lived in the suburbs of    
 London;some came out of London during 
 the war to avoid the bombing.Two of   
 the inhabitants were moved out during 
 the war and decided to stay when the  
 war was over and had a house built for
 them on an acre of land.              
 Most of the farms have many animals   
 and an orchard.The village hall was   
 built in 1885 and is for public use.  </content>
