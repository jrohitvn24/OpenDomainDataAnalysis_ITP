		<title>06TRAFFIC IN WESTERLEIGH</title>
		<content>  {Westerleigh roads get quite busy.   
 This is because people travel to work 
 in Bristol from Yate instead of using 
 the main road which is longer.{Early  
{morning and late afternoon tend to be 
{busy times.}Some children surveyed the
 traffic in Westerleigh.They found the 
{island in front of the church}to be a 
{very dangerous place.}Between 11.25   
 and  11.45 am.one morning, 54 vehicles
 passed by going towards Bath or       
 Bristol.Our teacher is worried when he
 drives that way each morning because  
 it is{difficult to see}in all         
 directions.There have been{several    
{minor accidents.                      
   We would not like to live in the    
 nearby houses because it would be very
 noisy and we could not play safely    
 outside.A lorry might even crash into 
 a garden.{We would complain to the    
{council about the traffic.            </content>
