 As our area is entirely rural         
 -virtually all farmland and farms!-   
 entertainment is hard to find.Thus    
 reference will be made to some of the 
 entertainment which goes on in the    
 villages bordering our square.        
 The{"Hampshire Chronicle"}of July 19th
 1985 reports on the activities of the 
 Womens Institutes at Easton and Itchen
 Abbas/Avington.The former had just    
 visited Selborne and Mottisfont Abbey 
 and the latter enjoyed a talk on      
 'pottery'.                            
 The youngsters of the area have often 
 complained of having nothing to do in 
 the evenings.The formation of the     
 "{Itchen River Rats"} was a response  
 to this sort of complaint. An all     
 night sponsored Pool Marathon to raise
 money.
