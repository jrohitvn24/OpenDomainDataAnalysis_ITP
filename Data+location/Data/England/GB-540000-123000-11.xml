		<title>11FLETCHING PUBS</title>
		<content> Fletching boast two pubs, Both reflect
 the present day tread fowards serving 
 food as well as drinks. The Rose &amp;    
 Crown is the older, The building      
 dating from 1550 though records show  
 there has been an inn on this site    
 since 10th century times. A           
 restaurant, opened about 5 years ago, 
 attracts custom from outside the      
 village but it is also used as the    
 "local" for village sports clubs      
 -cricket and football trophie are much
 in evidence. This latter ensures      
 regular consumption of real ale as    
 opposed to caned beer and lager or    
 wine (on the increase nationally) The 
 Griffin attracts 2 distinctly         
 different clentelle. Local youths play
 pool and drink at the bar but the Egon
 Roney recommended restaurant is       
 pationised by the more mature and     
 affluent who come from furter afield. </content>
