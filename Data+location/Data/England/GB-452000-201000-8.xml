		<content>      The Neighbourhood Centre at      
Blackbird Leys is a good example of how
people in a community can help each    
other.   It is staffed by voluntary    
workers and is open five days a week   
There have been several organised group
activities suitable for different age  
groups.   The Centre is also used as an
advice centre helping with a variety   
of social problems.   There is also a  
coffee bar where people can meet       
socially during the day.               
     The Centre does have staffing     
problems.   It is difficult to get help
on a regular basis and volunteers all  
have to be trained.   One of the       
workers said that it was annoying to   
think that people experiencing         
difficulties arising from unemployment 
were not getting all they were entitled
to.   She found it a very satisfying,  
worthwhile job.                        </content>
