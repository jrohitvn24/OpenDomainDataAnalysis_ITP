		<title>16The Meadow Grange Nursery</title>
		<content> Meadow Grange Nursery is situated at  
 Honey Hill on the A290, the main road 
 between Canterbury and Whitstable.    
 A nursery has been there since l933,  
 the present owner having it for the   
 last l9 years.                        
 It covers 2 1/2 acres, with 29,000    
 square feet of modern glass houses in 
 which the tomatoes, cucumbers and     
 lettuce are, for the first time, being
 organically grown. All the bedding    
 plants and geraniums are grown at the 
 Nursery with about half the alpine    
 plants and shrubs being bought in, as 
 are the fruit trees. A great variety  
 of tubs, pots and garden ornaments are
 available, including paving slabs for 
 patios.                               
 There is a small shop for fruit,eggs, 
 vegetables and flowers which helps the
 local people as there is no other shop
 for l l/2 miles.                      </content>
