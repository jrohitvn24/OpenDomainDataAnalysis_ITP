		<title>11An Indian band</title>
		<content> Roop has been living in Bilston for 15
years. He is involved in an Indian band
called the "Preet Group". He plays the 
drums and the bongo's. It took Roop    
three years to learn to play the drums.
There are five members in the group    
who's names are S.K., Saray, Tara,     
Rasnjit and S.L. They have been        
together for about a year. The Preet   
group were influenced by other Indian  
bands such as "Heera" Group,"Apma      
Sangeet" and "Navpreet". The group     
attends weddings,parties,public        
houses,and lots of other occasions.    
They are about to make their first     
record which they hope is a success.   
 Roop doesn't think highly of Bilston. 
He has been going to school in Bilston 
all his life. Roop is very talented    
and the group will be a success in the 
very near future.
