		<content> There are some interesting aspects of 
  Park Farm.One interesting aspect     
 is the well.The well was suspected of 
 being there by John Pratt. He noticed 
 it when it rained very heavily and the
 water ran away. The stone was pulled  
 up and underneath was a Georgian well 
 built around 200 years ago. Another   
 object is the fire place. The fire    
 place was found when the house was    
 being decorated. It was found behind a
 wall. The Reeve (or local tax         
 collector) used the house as a hunting
 lodge and in the fire place they      
 roasted the wild boar.                
 The cellar was an inportant part      
 of the house. In the Reeve's time the 
 cellar would be full of wine.         
 Many years ago the surroundings were  
 woods and fields. These were used by  
 the Reeve as a hunting area for wild  
 boar.                                 </content>
