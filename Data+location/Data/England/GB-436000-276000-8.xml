		<title>08Fire at Community College</title>
		<content>  Everyone remembers the 20th September
 1984 as it affected everyone who lives
 here. This was the day that the sports
 complex burned down and a million     
 pounds worth of damage was caused by  
 two youths who ripped open a large    
 landing mat to set fire to the foam.  
 They wanted to distract the office    
 staff counting money which they had   
 planned to steal. Sadly it worked     
 too well as the fire burned down the  
 whole sports complex.  Fortunately    
 everyone escaped.The two youths were  
 sentenced to five years custody.  The 
 community has rallied around,planning 
 a lot of fund raising events to make  
 the college's facilities even better. 
   The new plans include a theatre and 
 music rooms, as well as to rebuild the
 sports complex.The swimming pool was  
 back in action in six months, we hope 
 the rest will be rebuilt soon.        </content>
