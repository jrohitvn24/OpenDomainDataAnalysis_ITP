 Barnaby Fair is a tradition that      
 happens every year in the month of    
 June.It has been happening for        
 generations and nobody really knows   
 the exact day or date it started.     
 Several hundreds of Gipsies come      
 selling horses of different breeds,   
 sizes and colours.They are auctioned  
 at Boroughbridge market in a field.   
 We have a road called Horsefair and   
 Gipsies used to run up and down with  
 the horses.                           
       Gipsies also sell pots and pans,
 pegs,scissors and horse tack.They read
 some peoples palms hoping in return   
 that they will buy something.         
       In 1862 barnaby Fair was created
 by Charles 2nd royal Charter.Gipsies  
 used to stay for about a fortnight but
 now they quickly move in and out.
