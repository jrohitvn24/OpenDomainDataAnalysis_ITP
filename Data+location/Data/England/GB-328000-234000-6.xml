		<content>   The building of most interest in our
 area is{Michaelchurch Court,}the old  
 manor house of the village.The        
 original house is of the{sixteenth}   
{century}or maybe a little             
 earlier.There are eighteenth century  
 and more recent parts added on.       
    At one time it was the home of the 
{Traffords.}The most famous Trafford   
 was{Randolph}who made the first       
 airfield in Herefordshire,at          
 Michaelchurch.                        
    Mr.Hunter,the biggest landowner in 
 this area also lived there.When he was
 older he moved out and the building   
 eventually began to fall into{ruins.  
 It was bought my{Mr.McPherson}who is  
 now slowly rebuilding it.Some of the  
 rooms are now used as holiday flats.A 
 swimming pool is being put into what  
 used to be the South wing.
