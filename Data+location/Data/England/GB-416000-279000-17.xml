		<title>17HONEST FRUIT PICKERS</title>
		<content>  June and July is a busy time in the  
 soft fruit growing farms around       
 Solihull. Many local farms rely on the
 pick-your-own trade. At Woodhouse farm
 Catherine de Barnes, a 'sin-bin' has  
 been placed near the cash desk where  
 visitors are encouraged to make a     
 donation if they have eaten any of the
 crop while picking. In recent years   
 the idea has raised hundreds of pounds
 for Warren Pearl House, a home for the
 elderly, in Solihull town centre. In  
 1984 Â£360 was raised in this way.     
 Pick-your-own visitors have come to   
 expect this routine as they pay for   
 their strawberries.
