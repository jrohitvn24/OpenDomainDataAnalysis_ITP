   Aslackby is a classic example of a  
 village which pulls together to get   
 things done. It is an extremely       
 friendly village too and many people  
 will go out of their way to keep      
 everything looking neat and tidy.     
   Every year, there is a summer fete  
 with all stalls made by the people of 
 the village. Vast amounts of money are
 raised for the church. As much as     
 Â£1000 a year,which is very good for a 
 village of its size.                  
   The church holds a Harvest Festival 
 which is always well attended, despite
 the village not having its own vicar. 
   The village always enters the Best  
 Kept Village competion.               
   There is also a Village Hall Quiz to
 help maintain the village halls of the
 area, and also, to simply keep them in
 use.                                  </content>
