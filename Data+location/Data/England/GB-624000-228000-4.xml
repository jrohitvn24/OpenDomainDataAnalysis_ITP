		<content> Forty years ago Dovercourt seafront   
 had a{Band Pavilion}where in the      
 summer a band used to play seven      
 nights of the week. There was an{open 
{air swimming pool.}It had a spring    
 board and tiered diving boards.There  
 was also a water chute.It didn't have 
 a filter plant like pools have today  
 so it was closed once a fortnight -   
 emptied,hosed down and scrubbed before
 being filled with fresh seawater. In  
 addition to this there was a large    
 paddling pool with a sandy bottom.    
  The{holiday camp}was built just      
 before the Second World War.For a     
 while it was used for Jewish refugees 
 who escaped from Nazi-occupied Europe.
  In 1953 there were gale force winds  
 and very high seas which caused       
 serious flooding  in Dovercourt and   
 Harwich.We now have sea defences to   
 prevent this happening again.         </content>
