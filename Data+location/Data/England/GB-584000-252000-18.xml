		<title>18Children's Games in Lawshall</title>
		<content>Through the summer time outdoor games  
tend to be influenced by the media     
coverage ie when Wimbledon is on lots  
of children are playing tennis in the  
garden.Swimming and roller skating at a
nearby rink are very popular at present
but these facilities are 6 miles away, 
and with the lack of public transport  
these pastimes always involve an adult 
taking the children by car.Traditional 
Â£baby'dolls,although still favoured by 
younger girls,have been replaced by    
teenage fashion dolls for the older    
girls,each having wardrobes of clothes,
cars, horses even boyfriend dolls! The 
boys too,play with dolls,tough guy     
types of army dolls with there own     
jeeps,helicopters,camping kits and     
walkie-talkie sets. Indoor pastimes in-
clude painting,colouring,board games,  
card games and computer and video games
are extremely popular at present.      </content>
