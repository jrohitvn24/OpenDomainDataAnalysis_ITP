		<title>12EDUCATION IN THE AREA</title>
		<content> In Comberton there are four schools,  
 there is a college, a primary, a      
 private and a nursery.                
 We went and asked local people their  
 views on education and schools.       
 Meridian School has an excellent      
 reputation though Meridian should have
 smaller classes because we have 31 and
 more in a class.                      
 The subjects that they teach at       
 Meridian are good.The college has a   
 good reputation but more disipline is 
 needed.The exams you can pass at the  
 college are CSE (certificate of       
 secondary education.) GCE (genaral    
 certificate of education.) 'O' levels 
 (ordinary exam) 'A' levels (advanced  
 exam.)                                
 The parents of the children at any of 
 the four schools when asked, said they
 were satisfied with the education     
 supplied.                             </content>
