{     Parent-Teacher Association.      
        The P.T.A. has provided the    
 school with many extras: the swimming 
 pool, changing rooms for boys and     
 girls, the B.B.C. computer, and most  
 recently, play equipment in the school
 field. David Barrett writes about the 
{Sponsored Walk}to raise funds for the 
 play equipment:"When I got to the     
 first check point I had a drink of    
 orange.Then I kept on running until I 
 got to the second check point I tipped
 a cup of water over my head.Then I had
 two of my sweets until I got to the   
 other check point.There I didn't have 
 a drink at all.When I got to the      
 fourth check_point I tipped another   
 cup of water over my head.When I got  
 to the last check point I just had a  
 glass of water and went back to the   
 school to have a hot_dog."            </content>
