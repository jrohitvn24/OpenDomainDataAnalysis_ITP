		<title>15Georgina's Sunday Outing</title>
		<content>      I woke up at in unfamiliar room  
 because I was staying with my auntie  
 in{Pamber Heath,}near{Reading.}My     
 sister, Uncle Tony and I took the two 
 dogs, Linus and Taron, for a walk on  
 the Common.                           
      Afterwards we all went to        
{Tadley's Sunday Market.}It was very   
 big, with a lot of stalls, mostly     
 selling clothes and shoes. We bought  
 some fruit and two pairs of shoes and 
 then went home for dinner.            
      In the afternoon we went walking 
 in the woods. We walked by a stream   
 where it was very boggy. The walk was 
 about two miles long and nearly       
 everybody's legs were aching before   
 long.                                 
      When we got back we packed, said 
 goodbye and left for the car journey  
 home. There were traffic delays so it 
 took us about three hours.            </content>
