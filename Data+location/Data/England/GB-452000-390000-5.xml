		<title>05Urban Functions in Maltby</title>
		<content> The agricultural village of Maltby was
 transformed by the sinking of Maltby  
 colliery in 1908.Into the growing town
 moved thousands of workers, from      
 neighbouring counties and older       
 coalfields such as Scotland and North-
 umberland. Boosted by NCB investment  
 the colliery remains a major employer 
 and economic force. The growth of     
 manufacturing has diversified         
 employment, with factories stimulated 
 by motorway building. The town has    
 also developed into a middle order    
 service centre, with market,services, 
 shops and entertainment for its own   
 population and the nearby villages.   
 Lastly,expanding estates and improved 
 communications have led to an increase
 in residential function. Thus in 1985 
 Maltby is mining town,service centre, 
 industrial focus and dormitory        
 settlement combined.                  </content>
