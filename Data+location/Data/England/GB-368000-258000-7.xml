		<title>07HEALTH: CARE OF THE ELDERLY</title>
		<content> A District Nurse will visit people in 
 their own homes if necessary for minor
 medical treatment such as dressings,  
 injections or help with getting up or 
 being put to bed. Visits can also be  
 arranged for a chiropodist. There is a
 'Meals-on-wheels' Service in Bromyard 
 for meals to be taken to pensioners in
 their own homes if thought beneficial.
 On the outskirts of Bromyard there is 
 a Geriatric Hospital under the        
 National Health Service, and at       
 Tedstone Court, a large Georgian House
 in the area 8 elderly people are cared
 for privately with a staff of a       
 fulltime State Enrolled Nurses with   
 assistance from local farmers' wives  
 and cottagers. A Doctor calls once a  
 week. As may be seen old folk are well
 cared for in the area, and it is      
 agreed that the good neighbourliness  
 here is good.                         </content>
