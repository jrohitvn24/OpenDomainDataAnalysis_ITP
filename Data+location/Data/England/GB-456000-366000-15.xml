		<content>  In 1984 the Club was formed with the 
 aim of giving children a safe         
 environment to practise their cycling 
 skills and take part in races.        
  Our school caretaker is a founder    
 member and organiser of the club.It   
 has 93 members of whom 25 are regional
 champions including the caretaker's   
 son.                                  
  The Club has strict safety rules     
 insisting on protective clothing and  
 good maintenance of bikes.Members are 
 expected to obey Club rules and set a 
 good example to all B.M.X.riders.     
  A B.M.X.race is always exciting.The  
 speed and height of the jumps is      
 exhilarating.                         
  In Sherwood Junior School 71 children
 own B.M.X.bikes,showing how popular   
 this style of bike has become.B.M.X.  
 competitions are sometimes shown on   
 television.                           </content>
