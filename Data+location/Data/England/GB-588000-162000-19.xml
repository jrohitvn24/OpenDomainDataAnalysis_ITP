 Our school was built in one of the    
 pits where they used to dig brick-    
 earth.We call it the Hollow.The brick-
 works first opened in the C18th and   
 most of the older houses in Murston   
 used to be rented by brickworkers.The 
 bricks are still stamped S.D.for      
 Smeed-Dean,the original owners.The    
 works are now run by Blue Circle      
 Industries and the number of          
 employees who work there is 53.Their  
 wages are Â£100 per week.The average   
 number of bricks made in an hour is   
 1400 and on an 8 hour shift 11200.The 
 brickworks runs on gas and the Burner 
 has been there 5 years.
