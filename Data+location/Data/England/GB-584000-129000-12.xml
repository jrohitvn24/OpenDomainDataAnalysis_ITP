		<title>12Lead toymaking in Rolvenden</title>
		<content>  {Mrs Newington}has been making lead  
 toy soldiers and other lead models    
 in Rolvenden for 12 years now. Her    
 son bought some Victorian moulds in   
 London and she began by helping him.  
   Every stage is done by hand in her  
 house in The Street. She begins by    
 melting down lead pipework, pouring   
 the molten lead into trays to make    
 ingots. These in turn are melted down 
 and the molten lead is poured into one
 of 150 different moulds. In a few     
 moments the mould can be emptied and  
 the long process of filing down and   
 painting can begin.                   
   The making of these "toys" is a very
 dangerous operation. Mrs Newington    
 spends no more than 1 hour each day at
 this and has regular check-ups for    
 possible lead poisoning. She is able  
 to sell all she makes without any     
 difficulty.                           </content>
