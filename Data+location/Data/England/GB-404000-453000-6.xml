		<content> In the last few years there have been 
 several{robberies,}especially near    
 Waterfall Cottage, where purses, hand 
 bags and other belongings have been   
 stolen out of parked cars.            
 The{Devonshire Arms}has been improved 
 and extended. There is a new bar and  
 lots of new bedrooms.                 
 The{Priory Church}has been restored.  
 The{Cricket}ground used to be on the  
 east side of the river but they moved 
 it to the other side because there is 
 more parking space.                   
 The{Village Hall}was built for        
 pantomimes, plays, shows, and parties.
 A new{car park}has been opened in     
 Bolton Abbey, and the car park at the 
 Cavendish Pavilion extended.
