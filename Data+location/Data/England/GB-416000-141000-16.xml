		<title>16Tumuli</title>
		<content>  Viewed from the air the most         
 striking thing about the area is the  
 vast network of ancient field systems 
 and tumuli.These date back to the     
 Bronze Age showing that the area was  
 well populated at that time.There are 
 over 100 tumuli in our area.The       
 majority are bowl barrows but there   
 are saucer, disc and bell barrows.Many
 of the barrows have been damaged or   
 destroyed by ploughing, but others    
 have revealed whole skeletons and     
 ashes showing that burial and         
 cremation were practised.Many of the  
 barrows had pottery urns in them some 
 with and some without human remains.  
 One barrow revealed 3 skeletons in a  
 sitting position plus one extra large 
 one whilst another had 1 burial a     
 cremation plus incense cup, a bronze  
 awl, amber beads, cowrie shells and a 
 bone pin.                             </content>
