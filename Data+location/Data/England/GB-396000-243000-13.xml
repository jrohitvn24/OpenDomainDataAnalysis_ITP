 In our classroom we have a{B.B.C.     
{Acorn B Computer,}which the{Parent    
{Teacher Association}bought for us.    
 It cost{Â£300}(but it was worth it!)   
 We have had it for nearly a year but  
 today we are excited because it is the
 first day we have used the{Disc Drive.
 The Disc Drive is a great advantage   
 because it loads a lot quicker than a 
 cassette and with a disc you don't    
 have to rewind.                       
 We have about{20 games}on disc and it 
 is great!                             
 We are also doing the{Domesday Project
 on disc.                              
 Our headmistress learnt how to use it 
 at the {Micros Centre, Perdiswell,    
{Worcester}so that she could teach us  
 how to use it.
