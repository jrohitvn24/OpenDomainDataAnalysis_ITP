 Surveying the hospital we talked to   
 many of the people who work there.    
                                       
 The student nurse finds the staff and 
 patients friendly  and that the       
 hospital is a good place to work.     
                                       
 The staff nurse finds the hospital    
 very good in general and everything   
 that is needed always there.          
                                       
 The sister finds the hospital good and
 likes the hours which are             
 approximately 38 hours a week.        
                                       
 the chaplain finds the hospital good  
 but that there are always ways of     
 improving. The patients always come to
 him for help and reassurance and he   
 always tries his best to help. He is  
 on call 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.</content>
