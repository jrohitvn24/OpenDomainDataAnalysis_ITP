		<title>02The Pig farm in Longdon</title>
		<content>  This venture started on June lst.1985
 on leased premises previously used for
 pigs.  It has room for 400 sows.      
  There are{250 gilts}and{17 boars}and 
 the first piglets are due on September
 13th.  The  pigs  are a  cross between
{Largewhite }and {Landrace }producing a
 breed called {Camborough.             
  They also cross the old British breed
 of {Saddlebacks }with  {Landrace}  and
 produce {Camborough Blue}which has the
 qualities  of both breeds.  The former
 are a hardy out-door breed; the latter
 quickly grow fat on a minimal diet.   
  The  farm  is  contracted  to  supply
 'weaners' (i.e. piglets, 13 weeks old,
 32 kilos in weight) to a firm in      
 Oxfordshire.                          
  The pigs are kept in straw yards. The
 land,  being  heavy clay is unsuitable
 for rearing them outdoors.
