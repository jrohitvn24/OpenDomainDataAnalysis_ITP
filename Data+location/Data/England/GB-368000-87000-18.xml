		<title>18The River Winterborne</title>
		<content> As the name suggests this river only  
 flows fully in the Winter, when it    
 often floods. It flows East, joining  
 the Frome which enters Poole Harbour. 
 In the past the flooding of the water 
 meadows was controlled by hatches and 
 cuts. Flooding was carried out for    
 short periods in Winter and Spring to 
 give a good early bite for sheep.     
 Alongside the river were some marshy  
 places where Withy Beds were grown    
 There are remnants of these to be seen
 today, but they are overgrown and     
 neglected. In the river are fish and  
 invertebrates providing food for other
 animals such as Kingfishers and the   
 occasional Heron.                     
 The river dries completely in Summer, 
 but there is plenty of water below    
 ground, and there are two ponds with  
 the usual variety of wildlife such as 
 frogs, reeds and insects.             </content>
