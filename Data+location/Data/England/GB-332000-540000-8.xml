		<title>08Houses in Sebergham</title>
		<content>    The majority of houses are now     
 owner occupied.  Very few houses have 
 been built within the past eighty     
 years.  A disused quarry provided     
 stone for some houses whilst many were
 built from cobbles out of the river.  
    Roofs are of either Westmorland    
 slate or concrete tiles.              
    The Victorian Rectory standing on  
 an eminence facing SW and overlooking 
 the river is brick built and very sub-
 stantial.  The house had been run down
 whilst in the ownership of the church 
 but was sold into private hands in    
 1976.  Extensive alterations have been
 made in the past two years enlarging  
 the stables and adding two extensions 
 to the house itself to give greater   
 family accommodation and comfort.     
 These extensions are of brick or      
 concrete block construction with      
 cavity walls.                         </content>
