		<title>16THE CHURCH-SUTTON ST JAMES</title>
		<content> We have chosen the parish church as   
 our central feature because it is very
 different to others, as the tower is  
 separate from the main building. There
 are two theories as to why this is.One
 theory is that during the Civil War in
 the seventeenth century, there was a  
 fire during the fighting. Another idea
 is that the church had fallen into    
 disuse and somehow caught fire.Someone
 told us that the church and tower were
 built separately because the land was 
 so wet and marshy.It is hard to know  
 the real reason, but it is an         
 attractive church, small and very     
 light. The tower walls are almost a   
 metre thick and is an excellent       
 example of medieval construction.     
 The church was built and maintained by
 the local people, but, as mentioned   
 it is now in two parts.
