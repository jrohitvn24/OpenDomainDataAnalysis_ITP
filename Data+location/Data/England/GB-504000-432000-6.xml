		<content> The disparate nature of block 05040432
 is noway better illustrated than by a 
 spatial mapping of the density of     
 graffiti and its concomitant          
 vandalism. Go around Cottingham and   
 you will find some if you look hard   
 enough. After all graffiti writers are
 as old as history and historically the
 pictures are written messages of the  
 life of the times.  Then go north and 
 east from Cottingham towards the newer
{Council Estates}and it becomes less of
 a search. Through North Hull and      
 towards Orchard Park the wall messages
 begin to jump out at you.  No longer  
 is there the need to search. So       
 Cottingham youth does not feel the    
 urge to write all over?  Why is this  
 so?  Certainly Orchard Park lays claim
 to be one of the four most{deprived   
 Council Estates in the country. In    
 contrast affluence rules in Cottingham</content>
