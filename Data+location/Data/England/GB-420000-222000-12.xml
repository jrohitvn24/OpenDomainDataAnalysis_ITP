		<title>12LOWER FARM</title>
		<content> Lower farm is in icomb. just at the   
 begining of icomb. it has not many    
 sheep and lambs. or cattle. it        
 normally has fresians and one bull. it
 does not take them long to do the     
 sheep shearing because there is not   
 many sheep. they do not have pigs or  
 chickens. the drive is very bumpy. my 
 dad works on the farm so does mr.     
 hunt.my grandad just does like pulls  
 lambs out of sheep. it is hard work to
 do this because you need to keep the  
 sheep still. they have three felds to 
 harvest. we borrow mr teags harvester 
 the farm house is very old.
