		<content>  There are a number of different      
 sorts of housing in Wybunbury. There  
 are a number of old cottage-type      
 dwellings which at one time must have 
 formed the nucleus of the village. To 
 these have been added a wide range of 
 more modern housing.There are a number
 of council houses most of which       
 have been bought from the council by  
 their occupants.                      
                                       
  There are large private housing      
 estates springing up which offer      
 modern housing at a reasonable        
 price, thus attracting first time     
 buyers.                               
                                       
  A number of vacaant, isolated farm   
 houses and similar large houses have  
 been privately bought and renovated.An
 example of this is the old Wybunbury  
 Vicarage which is now a luxury home.  </content>
