		<title>16ALL SAINTS CHURCH BRANSTON</title>
		<content> Branston church is called All Saints  
 and was built before the Norman       
 conquest in 1066 although hardly any  
 of the original church is left. On    
 Christmas Day 1962 there was a fire   
 that tragically damaged the church.   
 The fire was first seen at about 8.15 
 pm and was not put out by Lincoln Fire
 Service for at least 6 hours.The fire 
 damaged a lot of the church including 
 the stained glass east window.New     
 glass was designed by Mr Keith New    
 whose work is also to be seen in      
 Coventry Cathedral.In 1965 during the 
 fitting of a new heating system,      
 workmen discovered the vault of Sir   
 Cecil Wray, whose descendants lived in
 Branston for many years.Coffins were  
 found of Lord and Lady Vere Bertie,   
 Dame Mary and Sir Cecil Wray, Henry   
 and William Leslie Melville and 3     
 unknown infants.                      </content>
