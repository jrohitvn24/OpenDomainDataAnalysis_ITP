		<content>   {Brackenbury Barracks}are right on  
 the cliff top and a{bomb disposal unit
 of the Royal Engineers is stationed   
 here. The men are Ukranian. The unit  
 has been here since the First World   
 War. The work done is classified.     
   {A hang_gliding club}called the     
 "Suffolk Floaters" uses the cliff.    
 Brackenbury Cliff is the highest point
 along this section of the coast at    
 which it is safe to fly. The air rises
 up the steep cliff and causes a{lift  
{band}which is necessary for           
 hang-gliding. They hang-glide along   
 the cliff and not out to sea as this  
 would cause them to leave the lift    
 band with disastrous results!         
    The cliff is a good view-point and 
 is popular with residents and holiday 
 makers. There are many beach huts here
 which tend to be unsightly.
