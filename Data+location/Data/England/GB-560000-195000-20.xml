		<content>{ A Policeman.}Our local police station
 was closed in 1968 and re-opened in   
 1981.it is now manned two hours daily.
 All 999 calls go through to head      
 office in Chelmsford.I am a community 
 policeman with 80% of policing done on
 foot.I enjoy being in Hutton,there is 
 a variety of work as the area takes in
 residential,rural and industrial      
 premises.Over the last 3 months there 
 were 104 thefts,39 burglaries and 29  
 crimes of criminal damage.Glue        
 sniffing and drugs are not a problem. 
{Director of an engineering firm.}This 
 industry is 23 years old and we have  
 been in Hutton for 20 of them. We     
 employ 60 people in manufacturing     
 parts for Ford Tractors and anything  
 else connected with machine shop      
 engineering.We deliver nationwide with
 one lorry and export to Brazil and    
 Australia for example.                </content>
