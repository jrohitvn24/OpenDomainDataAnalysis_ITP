		<content>  Policemen in Yeovil are organised    
 into 3 shifts 10pm_6am ,6am_2pm, 2pm  
 _10am called nights,earlies and       
 lates.They divide the shifts as       
 follows:-                             
 7 Nights _ 2 Lates _ 5 Earlies _      
 2 Days off _ 5 Lates _ 2 Earlies _    
 Long weekend.                         
  As well as the traditional{'BEAR'}   
 work,traffic control and              
 direction,some officers  are used to  
 supervise men and women,including     
 Civilion helpers,traffic wardens and  
 special constables.Much of the work   
 includes modern equipment including   
 Telex machines and computers.These    
 mean that the control room is able to 
 respond quickly to calls for help and 
 to deploy men where they are most     
 wanted in as short a time as possible.
