		<content> Newchurch is a small village.  In some
 parts there are no pavements as is    
 usual in a small island village.      
 Newchurch is built around its church  
 which had been originally built in the
 early 11th century.  It was{SAXON.    
 Newchurch is centred around the Shoot.
 The houses in Newchurch vary in age   
 and the older houses are mostly       
{VICTORIAN}but there are quite a few   
 houses built in the 1920's.  The new  
 houses are not older than 10 years old
 and some have just been built.  The   
 pub in Newchurch is called The        
 Pointer.  In the part of the village  
 that is nearest to Sandown there is a 
 very old building that is now a       
 cottage but looks like it was once an 
 18th century tavern.  Most of the land
 around Newchurch is farm land but     
 there is some rough land and boggy    
 places.                               </content>
