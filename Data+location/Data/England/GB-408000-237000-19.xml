		<title>19BROADWAY FLOWER SHOW</title>
		<content>{The Broadway Flower Show}is held      
 annually in the Lifford Hall on the   
 second Saturday in September. It was  
 established in 1962. It offers an     
 opportunity for local people to       
 display their skills in gardening,    
 flower arranging, cookery and         
 handicrafts. There are 70-75 classes. 
 Children can enter classes such as 'a 
 miniature garden on a plate', collage,
 painting or simple cookery. Twenty    
 trophies are awarded for merit in the 
 different classes and are usually     
 presented by a local personality. The 
 Show is supported by local businesses 
 and attracts a lot of interest in the 
 village and surrounding area. At the  
 end of the Show produce is auctioned  
 to defray the cost of staging the     
 event.
