		<content> The two village schools that are      
 closing,are Old Alresford and Hinton  
 Ampner at Bramdean.We are moving into 
 Hinton Ampner School while ours is    
 being rebuilt.We will have to have a  
 temporary classroom put up as there   
 wont be room for all of us there.     
 When we move back to Cheriton,        
 children from Kilmeston,Beauworth and 
 Bramdean will be coming to us. Once   
 there were schools in all these       
 villages.                             
 Hinton Ampner had a farewell gathering
 at Bramdean Village Hall and one lady 
 there was a pupil 72 years ago!       
 Everyone had a commemorative mug with 
 the school crest and dated 1733-1985. 
 There are only 16 children left at    
 Hinton and they spent a day with us,  
 so they will feel at home when they   
 come to us in September.
