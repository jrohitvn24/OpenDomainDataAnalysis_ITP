 The countryside around the village of 
 Ragdale is diverse.  At the northern  
 end the land is flat.  There is a     
 covered Reservoir close to the road   
 leading into Ragdale which is         
 maintained by the Soar Division of    
 Severn Trent Water Authority.  The    
 ground falls sharply into Ragdale     
 village and rises again on the other  
 side.  There are several streams      
 traversing the area and each of these 
 lies in a valley, so that the southern
 area is one of rolling countryside.   
                                       
                                       
 National Grid Electricity pylons cross
 the western half of the Ragdale area  
 from north to south.
