		<title>01Cobham Park and west Strood</title>
		<content> The area is mainly rural, including   
 a high proportion of deciduous        
 woodland. Cobham Park occupies about  
 half of the area. It is quite hilly   
 and largely uncultivated. Nearly 0.1  
 of the total area is made up of       
 orchards, belonging to a small number 
 of farms. The A2 passes through the   
 area (west to east) and the M2 begins 
 in the area.                          
 There is no significant industry.     
 Places of interest include Cobham     
 Hall, Gad's Hill, the site of a Roman 
 villa and the small village of Shorne 
 Ridgeway.                             
 A small residential part of Strood is 
 included to the south-east of the     
 area.
