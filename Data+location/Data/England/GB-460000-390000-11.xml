		<title>11EMPLOYMENT IN OUR VILLAGE</title>
		<content> We did a family survey on jobs in our 
 village,to find out the most popular  
 jobs,and how many people did each     
 job.First we wrote down questions and 
 then asked the children them.We put   
 the results on the computer.Then asked
 the computer how many people have the 
 same job and what percent.These are   
 the results.26 men are miners which   
 = 45%.4 men are unemployed which = 7%.
 4 men work at the GlassBulbs which =  
 7%.The others did many differnt jobs. 
 20 mothers are house_wifes which =    
 35%,and 3 mothers work at the glass   
 bulb factory a figure of 5%(approx.)  
 Again the others did many different   
 things.I was surprised that in our    
 survey only three  women worked at the
 Glass  Bulbs as they do employ a lot  
 of women there.
