		<content>The Axis Club arranges outings for     
physically handicapped adults on a     
weekly basis.                          
      There is a voluntary organisation
run by disabled people to give advice  
to other disabled people.  It is       
similar to the Citizens Advice Bureau. 
       There is a scheme being         
developed to encourage the disabled to 
run their own businesses from special  
premises.         To help families with
difficulties a Centre is available     
where,usually   the mother, is given   
help and ideas   about how to look     
after her family.
