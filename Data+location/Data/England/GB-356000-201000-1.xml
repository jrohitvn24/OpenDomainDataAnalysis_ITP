		<content> Most of the area is {grazing land}or  
{woodland.}The trees are a mixture of  
 coniferous and deciduous. There are a 
 few farm {houses}scattered around.Most
 of the  other{houses }are in the      
 south-east corner.                    
 The area has got quite a lot of {foot 
{paths}.Most of the {roads }are very   
{narrow }and there are a lot of {sharp 
{bends }.On top of the hills there are 
 a lot of {pleasant views}and on some  
 you can see the {River Severn.}There  
 are quite a few {streams or brooks    
{going}through the forest and under the
 roads.                                
       The only amenity is {Hewelsfield
