		<title>08THWAITES TENNIS COURT</title>
		<content> Three years ago a local person had the
 idea to have a tennis court in The    
 Green because grown ups and children  
 had to travel in to Millom for a game 
 of tennis. The field that the tennis  
 court was put in was given for the    
 young to play on years ago, so they   
 put a tennis court on it. The court   
 took roughly 12 months to build and is
 40 metres by 20 metres. The money was 
 raised with the help of the Village   
 Hall Committee, Sports Council, BNFL, 
 Manpower Services and Copeland Council
 and it took about one year to raise.  
 The time limited for people to stay   
 and play on the court is one hour.    
 Tennis tourniments are held annually. 
 22% of the families questioned make   
 use of the tennis court.              
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
