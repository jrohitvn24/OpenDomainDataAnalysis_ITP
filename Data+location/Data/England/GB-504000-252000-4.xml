		<content>   The area is served by{St.Mark's     
{Anglican/Methodist Church}in Calder   
 Rise and by{St.Philip &amp; St.James R.C. 
{Church}in Waveney Avenue. A{Baptist   
{Church}is nearby in Brickhill Drive.  
   Other denominations meet locally in 
 school halls and in the Brickhill     
 Community Centre, Avon Drive.         
   The churches work together and do   
 not try to rival each other. They also
 provide accommodation for group       
 meetings of a wide variety, such as   
 Playgroups, Open House, Guides,       
 Brownies, Aerobics and Slimming Clubs.
   The minister of St.Marks said that  
 between seventy and eighty people     
 attend worship on an average Sunday   
 morning. Because most of the houses   
 are occupied by young marrieds, he    
 conducts thirty to forty baptisms each
 year but only six to ten weddings. He 
 expects this to increase in time.     </content>
