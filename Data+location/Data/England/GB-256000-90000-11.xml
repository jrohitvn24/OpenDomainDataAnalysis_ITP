		<title>11THE SPECIAL EVENT</title>
		<content> On the day of Ten Tors there is a     
 Special Event for disabled young      
 people. Like the main event it is     
 walked over different distances up to 
 14 miles but is completed in one day. 
 Each party is accompanied by members  
 of the Junior Leaders Regiment. Adults
 from the young people's schools, homes
 or clubs and the Okehampton Ramblers  
 keep a watchful eye on the progress   
 these courageous walkers. The fact    
 that nearly all of them complete the  
 course is a lesson to all of those who
 are more able bodied.                 
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
