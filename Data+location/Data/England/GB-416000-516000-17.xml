		<title>17SHOPPING IN GAINFORD</title>
		<content>{SHOPPING}In Gainford today there are  
 only{eight shops,}a newsagent's, a    
 small supermarket, a butcher's shop,  
 two general dealers', a fish and chip 
 shop, a post office and a hairdressing
 salon. The number of shops has        
{decreased}over the years, due to the  
 easier access to neighbouring towns,  
 e.g.{Darlington and Barnard Castle.  }
 In May this year the village's only   
 bank closed, many people were most    
 annoyed with{Barclays Bank.           
 At the beginning of the century in    
 Gainford there were over{twenty shops,
 five grocers', four cobblers', a      
 miller's, a confectioner's, and a     
 dressmaker. In these days when there  
 was litle transport the village was   
{self-sufficient.}None of the villagers
 needed to travel out of the village so
 everything had to be provided for in  
 Gainford itself.                      </content>
