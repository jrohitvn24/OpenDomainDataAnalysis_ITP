Fund raising seems to be an endless    
task in the village and 1985 has seen a
major effort to raise enough money to  
modernise the village hall. The hall   
needed a new floor, heating system,    
kitchen, store room, new toilets and   
complete redecoration both inside and  
out.                                   
 Fund-raising events included a        
Sponsored Fun Run, a Village Tote, an  
"Auction of Anything", the publishing  
of a local magazine called Gayton News 
and many other well supported events.  
The Gayton News made 345 pounds and    
the Flower Festival, 1,260 pounds.     
These, along with generous donations   
from many  people plus a grant from    
the Northampton County Council enabled 
modernisation work to be carried out   
on the hall. It was re-opened on May   
10th 1985.                             </content>
