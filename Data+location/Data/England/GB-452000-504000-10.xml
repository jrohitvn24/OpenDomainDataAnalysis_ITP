		<title>10A day in Great Broughton</title>
		<content>       This morning I woke up and      
 dressed at 07.45. I went downstairs to
 make breakfast.                       
       After I'd had my breakfast I    
 cleaned my teeth and set off to school
 in the car at 08.45. At 09.00 the     
 whistle was blown and we went into    
 school. We had registration and read. 
 At 09.30 we started English work      
 followed by assembly. It finished at  
 10.30. We came in from play at        
 10.50 and did Maths. At 11.55 we      
 washed our hands and went into lunch. 
 We had fish fingers and chips. During 
 playtime we had recorder group and    
 some other things took us to hometime 
 at 15.30. At home I changed for tennis
 and rode to the courts. I played with 
 two of my friends for an hour from    
 16.00. I had tea and prepared for     
 brownies. I left at 18.10. At home I  
 watched television until 21.00.       </content>
