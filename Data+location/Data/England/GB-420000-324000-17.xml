I like to wear fashionable shirts which
are pale coloured and tight fitting.   
They have no collar but have a self-   
coloured band around the neck and the  
bottom of the sleeve.Sometimes I wear  
thin pin-striped or plain trousers or  
bleached jeans which are baggy and     
gathered around the bottoms.I like to  
wear either white socks or one luminous
pink and one bright green or yellow    
one.

I like to wear baggy T-shirts and      
jumpers with tight split skirts and a  
baggy white cotton jacket.On my feet I 
wear plastic sandals in bright colours 
and white socks.If I want to look smart
I wear an all-in-one flying suit made  
of creased cotton.I like to carry a    
matching plastic  bag.
