     On Tuesday I woke up at 6. 45 and 
I found out that my dad was not going  
to work. I got my clothes and put      
them in my bedroom then I went down    
stairs and my mum had made me some     
toast and coffee. When I had eaten my  
breakfast I went back up stairs, had a 
wash, brushed my teeth then I went into
my bedroom.I got dressed then I        
came down and brushed my hair then I   
finished my drink It was 8. 20 so I    
watched the television till  8. 35.    
When it was time to go  I said good    
bye to my mum and dad  then I went and 
called for Louise and we went to       
school. At schoolfirst we did maths,   
then we went into the hall, then we    
came out of the hall and I did three   
S.M.P cards.  We did S.M.P. till       
10. 30 which was playtime. At playtime 
I played rounders with Ruth, Hazel, Ann</content>
