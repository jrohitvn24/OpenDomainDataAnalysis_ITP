		<content> The A396 road runs north to south     
 through Bickleigh, parallel with the  
 River Exe. The minor roads are narrow 
 and winding, most with high banks,    
 which tend to make modern car travel -
 especially for visitors used to fast  
 roads - hazardous and nerve-racking.  
 Minor laybys do little to reduce      
 frustration when a wide or slow moving
 farm vehicle is encountered.          
 A June survey shows that, apart from  
 the expected heavy traffic flow at the
 beginning of the morning and at the   
 end of the afternoon, a very steady   
 flow of private cars maintains        
 throughout the main part of the       
 working day. There is a marked        
 increase of private cars during the   
 holiday season of July and August.    
 Most traffic passes through the       
 village.
