		<content> I am Samantha, age 13, completing my  
 final term in the Second Year. About  
 1000 children attend my school, a     
 number of whom travel from outlying   
 villages by School Bus. Main lessons  
 are graded but registration and       
 practical lessons are taken in mixed  
 ability groups. The school comprises  
 three main blocks: Maths &amp; Computer;  
 Art, Science and Metalwork; and       
 English - which also contains the Hall
 and Gym. Also we have 19 huts and 4   
 mobile classrooms. During the recent  
 Teachers' dispute several of the staff
 took strike action. The Headmaster    
 told pupils to treat the unexpected   
 free days as "working holidays". He   
 was optimistic! In general we are a   
 happy school and appear to maintain a 
 high standard of examination results.
