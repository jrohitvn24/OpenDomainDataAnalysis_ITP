 In our area there are lots of dykes   
 and we get mallards, swans, herons,   
 shelduck and moorhens.They make their 
 nests on the sides of the dykes.The   
 banks are steep and enemies can not   
 get them.The rabbits make burrows in  
 the ground in the corn field.Hares    
 make there forms in spring.The nest is
 under a hedge.The foxes make dens in  
 the grass at the sides of the fields. 
 The pheasant nests on the ground in   
 the corn fields.The first pheasants   
 were introduced into our area by a    
 local farmer about the year 1900.He   
 asked those who lived round about not 
 to shoot any pheasant for the first 5 
 years, so enabling the stock to       
 increase.Now the pheasants live wild  
 all over the area.
