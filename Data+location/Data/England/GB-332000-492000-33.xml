At Grizedale there is a Visitor Centre and tourist shop, an education building used by school groups called ‘The Yan’, a large café, a children’s playground, a bike hire centre and bike shop, a biomass boiler, the ‘Go Ape’ adventure course, and Forestry Commission offices. The Theatre in the Forest, opened in the 1970s, closed about ten years ago, although it was used occasionally for school plays until 2006 when it was converted into offices. The bike hire and sales centre is in the old sawmill, which closed in 1986.&lt;br />&lt;br />The North Face Trail for mountain bikes covers a large section of the west side of the forest and is very popular with visitors.&lt;br />&lt;br />The campsite has closed and is now further down the valley at Bowkerstead Farm. Camping costs are £6 per night for adults and £2.50 for children.&lt;br />&lt;br />   &lt;br />
