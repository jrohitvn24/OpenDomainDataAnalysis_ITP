		<title>02CHESTER-LE-STREET MARKET</title>
		<content> The market is held in the market      
 square at the bottom of the main      
 street.It used to be  held in the     
 middle of the town but there is a     
 Hintons supermarket there now.An      
 excellent view of the green canvas    
 canopies and milling crowds can be    
 seen from trains passing over the     
 viaduct.People come from all over the 
 county to buy and sell goods.A survey 
 which was made on the types of stalls 
 in Chester-le-Street market showed    
 that most stalls sell clothes.Others  
 sell vegetables,fancy goods and dress 
 materials.People are encouraged to buy
 things as they are cheap and mostly   
 good quality.Most stall-holders are   
 helpful.The market is held on Tuesdays
 and Fridays but is most popular on    
 Friday afternoons.
