		<content> Mr Foster has lived in the village at 
 Middle Farm since 1949. Most of the   
 land belonging to Middle Farm has been
 sold and now only 30 acres remain.    
  Mr Foster now contracts out          
 agricultural machinery to farmers in  
 the area. His machinery includes three
 tractors, two JCBs, a combine         
 harvester and two balers. He employs  
 four men who drive the machinery and  
 they work from 8am until 5pm. The     
 busiest time of the year is July until
 September when the crops are being    
 harvested. Mr Foster has had the      
 business for 20 years.                
  The farm also has stables and there  
 are eight horses which include a 20   
 year old Shetland pony. The horses are
 ridden by girls from Cottingham. The  
 farm includes two fields of grass and 
 ten acres of barley.
