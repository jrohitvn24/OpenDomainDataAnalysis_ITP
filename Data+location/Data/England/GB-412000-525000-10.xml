		<content> At this present moment in time there  
 is no mining of any sort taking place 
 within this area.However in the area  
 in the recent past there have been    
 sites of opencast mining,drift mining 
 and deep shaft mining.Within close    
 proximity to the area there are       
 currently sites of opencast mining    
 being worked.There was a large        
 opencast site working up to 2 years   
 ago but since then the land has been  
 filled in and returned to its original
 use,that of grazing land.In Ramshaw   
 beside the river Gaunless,is the site 
 of a drift mine,which has been worked 
 in the past but is not being worked   
 now.There are millions of tons of coal
 around that area but the proximity of 
 the river means that the workings     
 become flooded and it has become      
 uneconomical to work the pit.
