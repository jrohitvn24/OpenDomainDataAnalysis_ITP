		<title>13LOCAL HISTORY. WATER MILL</title>
		<content> The mill has been unchanged externally
 since rebuilding shortly after 1858,  
 replacing the earlier, possibly 16th  
 Century, dilapidated mill.  The 1858  
 survey of it refers to the low power  
 of the two open-bucket water-wheels   
 driving 3 pairs of Gray stones, and   
 one pair each of Black stones, French 
 stones and a Shelling stone.  There is
 evidence of a much larger iron        
 water-wheel on the south side. A      
 wooden axle open-bucket wheel on the  
 north side (remains were removed about
 1970) provided power for the          
 hammer-mill and rolling-mill, prior to
 the water-turbine installed in 1910,  
 and which is still in use driving the 
 rolling-mill. The mill which in 1985  
 employed 3 men, is used as a retail   
 outlet and store for pre-packaged     
 cattle feeds, although locally grown  
 barley is still rolled in the mill.   </content>
