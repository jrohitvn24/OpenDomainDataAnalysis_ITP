		<title>09AYLMERTON CHURCH</title>
		<content>  Aylmerton church is a member of a    
 group of parishes, which also includes
 West Runton and East Runton.          
  It is one of only a few remaining    
{round-tower}churches in Norfolk.  It  
 has an arch-way leading into the      
 tower, and part of the tower dates    
 from 930 A.D.                         
  The church is very strategically     
 positioned on top of a hill just north
 of the main settlement.  It is not    
 used as much as it was in earlier     
 years, but is still involved in the   
 community. {Services}are held every   
 Sunday morning, and twice on the first
 Sunday of each month.                 
  Every year, there are about five     
 weddings and about the same number of 
 funerals.  There are a few            
 christenings, and these are held at   
 the end of the services.              
{Volunteers}help maintain the church.  </content>
