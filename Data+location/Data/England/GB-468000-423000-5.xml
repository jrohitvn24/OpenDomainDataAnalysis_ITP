		<content> I have got quite a lot of pets. I have
 got one mouse and two rabbits and a   
 goldfish and a cat. We had some babies
 from the mouse but we sold them to the
 pet shop. There were ten of them and  
 we are getting a dog next year and it 
 is going to be a cocker spaniel with  
 fluffy ears off one of my mum's       
 friends at work. We are probably      
 getting it next year because it is    
 only a puppy now and not very big yet.
 It is a dog like Tracey's dog. Our cat
 is called Sooty but still I can't wait
 till next year.
