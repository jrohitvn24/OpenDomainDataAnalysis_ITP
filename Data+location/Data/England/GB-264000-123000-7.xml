		<content> One of the big houses in our area is  
 marked on our map as Vic. This is the 
 Vicarage.                             
 It was biult in Victorian days and is 
 a very big house with lots of rooms   
 and cellars. There are also stables   
 but there are no horses in them. The  
 building is made of stone and the     
 gutters are painted red. There is a   
 big garden and an orchard. There are  
 lots of trees to climb and good places
 to hide.                              
 The Vicar of Chittlehampton used to   
 live here. When the Vicar, Sub-Dean   
 J.H.B. Andrews, died in September 1984
 the Vicarage was cleared and in March 
 1985 it was sold for Â£97,000. It is   
 now lived in by the minister of the   
 Umberleigh Christian Fellowship which 
 has its chapel just over the river    
 bridge at Umberleigh. There is also a 
 Christian Youth Club that meets here. </content>
