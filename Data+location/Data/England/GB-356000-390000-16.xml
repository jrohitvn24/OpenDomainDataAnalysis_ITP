		<content>   {SKILLY}is another game requiring   
 equal teams. Whilst one team runs off 
 the other counts to one hundred and   
 then chases after the first team and  
 attempts to touch each person. If     
 caught, the person must stand with one
 hand against the wall. If a member of 
 the team who hasn't been caught can   
 touch the wall and shout{'Skilly'}all 
 those caught are immediately free. The
 game continues until all of one team  
 are caught.
