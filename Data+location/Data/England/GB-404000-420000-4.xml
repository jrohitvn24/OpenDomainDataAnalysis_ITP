		<title>04PUBLIC TRANSPORT</title>
		<content> A vast network of public road         
 transport is provided by West         
 Yorkshire's{Metro}system. These{buses}
 provide transport facilities in even  
 the most remote areas. The buses are  
 regular and fares are low in cost.    
                                       
 The terrain makes it difficult to     
 build railways, since the gradients   
 ars far from ideal. The{railway}that  
 ran along the valley bottom was closed
 some years ago.                       
                                       
 The proximity of the M62{motorway}has 
 had a profound effect upon the area.  
 It is possible to travel by road to   
 Leeds, Bradford, or Manchester        
 in about a half hour.
