		<content> In our area there are Badgers.The     
 entrance to their set is about        
 50cm.The Badgers live in the carpark  
 over the road from our school.We      
 planted some trees there about 5 years
 ago.Many birds come and settle near   
 our school.We have seen               
 woodpigeon,rooks,crows,blackbirds,jays
 and most of the tit family.           
 Sparrows,chaffinches and house-martins
 are the most common.                  
 There are many fields where hares,    
 rabbits and foxes live. We have       
 many different kinds of plants in our 
 area on which many insects and birds  
 live.There are many trees that shed   
 blossom mostly white. There are trees 
 like Lime, sycamore,hawthorn,oak,beech
 and elderberry and many more trees.The
 trees are growing in the area which   
 used to be the Forest of Arden.
