		<title>02FISHING IN PORTHLEVEN</title>
		<content>    Fishing is popular in Porthleven.  
 There are many people fishing but not 
 as many as long ago. In those days you
 could walk across the harbour by      
 jumping from boat to boat. Today in   
 summer there are approximately forty  
 fishing boats in the harbour, but in  
 winter there are only about six.      
    The majority of larger fishing     
 boats use echo sounders, Decca        
 navigators and radio telephones. The  
 echo sounders not only find the fish  
 but tell you how large the shoal is.  
    There are no trawlers and all the  
 boats fish in inshore waters. They    
 catch mackerel with feathers. This is 
 called whiffing and they use nets to  
 catch cod, ling, dogfish, conger eel  
 and pollock. The fish caught are      
 mainly sold in Newlyn but a few go to 
 the local fish merchant.
