		<content> To the North West of Old Warden lies  
 Warden Abbey.It was built in 1135 by  
 the Gastwick family.It was previously 
 an abbey for the{Cistercian}monks from
{Revaulx.}The actual house was built in
 1537.It is now owned br Mr Samuel     
 Whitbread who has leased it to        
 Landmark Trust and it is now a holiday
 home.                                 
{ }The abbey has been restored from an 
 old,rundown,decaying building.        
  The floors are linked by a spiral    
 staircase.Nearly all of the brickwork 
 is new,the only really old part of the
 building is the chimney.Outside the   
 abbey is a  stone coffin engraved with
 a sword.This coffin was found while   
 restoration work was going on.
