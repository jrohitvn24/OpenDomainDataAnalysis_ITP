		<content>     The Mill is owned by Courtaulds, a
Public Limited Company, and            
manufactures cotton,man-made fibres and
blends in a full range of counts i.e.  
thickness.It was built in stone by     
Arkwright in 1786 and is still in      
production 200 years later but is now  
powered by electicity instead of water.
The raw materials, spun single yarn,is 
brought by road to this Doubling Mill  
where the yarn is plied or twisted     
together into threads.These are sold   
for sewing threads,tapes,cotton socks, 
underpants,threads in knitted sweaters 
and jumpers sold in the High Street    
stores and the white stripe in men's   
pin-striped suits.Eight tonnes is      
produced each week,some being exported.
Headed by a manager and his assistant, 
there are 60 people employed at the    
Mill,half men and half women,most of   
whom live locally.                     </content>
