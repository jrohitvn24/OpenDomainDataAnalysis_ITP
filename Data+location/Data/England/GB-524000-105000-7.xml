		<content> pressing requirements.But the         
 environmental case is also compelling.
 There are some sites for housing,and  
 there will be more if the by-pass is  
 built.There will never be another     
 green wedge.Local residents do not    
 accept that a link road is needed on  
 the southern part of the golf course  
 to provide access to Brighton Council 
 land(known as the piggy bank).They    
 believe that an improved Hangleton    
 Lane is all that is needed.They also  
 oppose selling Greenleas Recreation   
 Ground for housing development even   
 though Hove Council estimates that it 
 could gain 1 million pounds from the  
 sale.Many local people think that the 
 Valley should be set aside for playing
 fields with a "green walkway" running 
 from Old Shoreham Rd. up to the Downs 
 &amp; for facilities like a garden centre,
 riding centre or pavilions.           </content>
