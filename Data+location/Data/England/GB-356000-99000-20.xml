		<content> The Ceilidh Club is an informal       
 association of no fixed membership    
 holding occasional folk music evenings
 in the Savile Hall.  Music is provided
 by local bands of folk musicians for  
 dancing and singing and appealing to a
 wide variety of interests.            
 The Camera Club has a membership of   
 about two dozen, meeting in the Savile
 Hall every fortnight during the winter
 months to hear talks on photographic  
 subjects.  Photographic competitions  
 are held both amongst the members and 
 with other photographic associations  
 in the county.                        
 Cattistock Women's Institute was one  
 of the first to be founded in Dorset  
 in 1917 and meets in the Savile Hall  
 on the first Thursday of every month. 
 There are 27 members, nine of whom    
 have compiled this information.
