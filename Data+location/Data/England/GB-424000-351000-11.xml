		<content> The parishes of Carsington,Wirksworth,
 Alderwasley,Idridgehay,Kirk Ireton,and
 Middleton are now held in plurality   
 and in 1984 the Rev'd.R.Caney became  
 the first Rector of this United       
 Benefice. He is assisted by the Rev'd.
 R.Smith as Curate and two Lay Readers 
 Rod and Pauline Higham.               
 Despite the various changes,attendance
 has not varied greatly over the last  
 three decades, the normal congregation
 being an average of 14. Recently, the 
 practice of processing round the      
 village, on the morning of Rogation   
 Sunday, has been revived quite        
 successfully.The ever popular Harvest 
 Festival,with Church decorated, is    
 held at the beginning of October. The 
 local school celebrates in church the 
 following morning.The Christmas Day   
 Communion service is usually attended 
 by a congregation of 25-30 worshippers</content>
