		<title>19Preston-the derelict docks</title>
		<content> In the south of the area is the River 
 Ribble which forms the Borough        
 Constituency Boundary of Preston.     
 South of that is Penwortham Golf      
 Course and its clubhouse.             
 Finally,in the extreme north,is a     
 small area of terraced,early          
 19th.century housing.                 
 To the west is the smaller,outer dock 
 basin which has been drained while    
 repair work on the dock gates is been 
 done,leaving silt and a growing number
 of weeds behind.                      
 Like most other buildings on the dock 
 estate,an old sand quarry is being    
 flattened out for redevelopment.      
 There are plans to develop the dock   
 area and create housing,industry,     
 shopping and leisure facilities.
