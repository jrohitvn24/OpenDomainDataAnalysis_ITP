		<title>13WADDINGTON FIRE-STATION</title>
		<content>   There are 11 part-time firemen in   
 Waddington and one fire-engine. The   
 fire-engine is going to be replaced   
 soon because it has travelled more    
 than 8,000 miles.                     
   The fire-station was built in 1950. 
 It serves an area of 4 square miles   
 and is called upon about 100 times    
 each year. The firemen practice once a
 week for two hours. They are paid     
 Â£1,500 per year. All the men have     
 other jobs. One owns a flower shop,   
 another owns a hardware shop, there is
 a lorry driver, a bus driver, a       
 barber, a plumber and a bricklayer.   
   When needed the men are called up to
 the fire-station by a bleeper. Only   
 six men are needed, so they have      
 dogtags with numbers on. When they    
 come they pick up a dogtag and when   
 the seventh man arives he will know   
 that he will not be needed.           </content>
