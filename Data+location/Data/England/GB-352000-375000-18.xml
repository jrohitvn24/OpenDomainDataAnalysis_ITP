 went to school in Runcorn having      
 passed the 11+, travelling to school  
 during the Great War by train with a  
 contract ticket. No school uniform but
 a cap had to be worn. There were      
 school dinners or sandwiches could be 
 taken. About 25 pupils per class. In  
 1918 he secured a job in a bank       
 staying for 44 years.                 
  He had a job whilst at primary school
 _collecting a gentleman's personal    
 post bag from the Post Office and also
 delivering newspapers. Each           
 evening after school he would collect 
 the outgoing post in the bag and take 
 it to the post office. There was      
 little time for playing. Other boys   
 would collect milk and deliver it usng
 a pint or quart jug to transfer milk  
 from churn to jug.                    </content>
