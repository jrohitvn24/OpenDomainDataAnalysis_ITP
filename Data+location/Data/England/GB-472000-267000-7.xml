		<content> LIFESTYLE IN A LARGELY RURAL AREA SUCH
 AS THIS ONE TENDS TO BE OF A HIGH     
 QUALITY COMPARED WITH MANY URBAN ONES.
 SEVERAL OF THE MORE REMOTE HOUSES IN  
 THIS AREA REPRESENT THE VILLAGE OF    
 CHAPEL BRAMPTON WHICH IS ADJACENT TO  
 PITSFORD BUT IS SITUATED IN ANOTHER   
 GRID.  MR. COWLEY'S FARM IS ONE SUCH  
 PROPERTY.                             
 INTERVIEWS WITH SEVERAL FAMILIES      
 SPREAD THROUGHOUT THE AREA REVEAL MANY
 COMMON PATTERNS OF FAMILY LIFE.       
 MANY FAMILIES COMPRISE MOTHER, FATHER 
 AND TWO CHILDREN WHOSE AGES ARE FROM  
 TWO TO FOUR YEARS APART.  FATHER IS   
 USUALLY THE FAMILY PROVIDER AND       
 FREQUENTLY TRAVELS TO WORK IN NEARBY  
 NORTHAMPTON.  HE WILL OFTEN SPEND HIS 
 WEEKENDS PLAYING SPORT, GARDENING AND 
 ENJOYING FAMILY LIFE.                 
 THE ANNUAL HOLIDAY IS A TIME IN WHICH 
 FAMILIES TRAVEL AND STAY IN A HOTEL.  </content>
