		<title>06BIOGRAPHY _ HENRY TRENGROUSE</title>
		<content>  Loe Bar was a notorious place for    
 shipwrecks.In 1807 H.M.S Anson was    
 wrecked on Loe Bar. Henry Trengrouse, 
 a Helston cabinet maker, went to the  
 scene. He was appalled that over one  
 hundred people drowned even though the
 Anson was almost touching the shore.  
 After watching a firework display he  
 thought of the idea of a rocket line  
 throwing apparatus.He made and        
 perfected a rocket which was fired    
 from a musket and could carry a light 
 line up to two hundred and fifty      
 yards. Then a rope  could connect ship
 and shore. He also invented the bosuns
 chair to carry people to shore safely.
 He made a cork lifejacket and designed
 an unsinkable lifeboat. All this work 
 cost him over three thousand pounds of
 his own money.His equipment saved many
 thousands of lives.A  monument to     
 Henry Trengrouse stands at Loe Bar.   </content>
