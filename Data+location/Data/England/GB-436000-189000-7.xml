		<content> Most houses in Denchworth are well    
 established. The oldest, Magpie       
 Cottage, was destroyed by fire in 1984
 but is being rebuilt to its original  
 specification of wattle and daub with 
 wooden frame. The village is Cruciform
 and is on clay. All the old business  
 premises are now converted to houses. 
 The houses date from 16th century,    
 the last few being added from 1950 on.
 Most villagers have moved in from     
 other areas. Housing is expensive from
 Â£60.000.  W. Grove, built on a 1939 to
 1945 airfield, comprises assorted     
 kinds of houses. Terraced Â£30 to      
 Â£40,000, semi-detached Â£35-45,000 and 
 detached houses Â£45-59,000. Young     
 families own these compact properties 
 with small gardens. A very few council
 houses and flats are available.There  
 is a residential caravan park.
