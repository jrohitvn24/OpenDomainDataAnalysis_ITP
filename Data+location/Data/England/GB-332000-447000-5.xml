		<title>05VIEWS FROM FLEETWOOD MOUNT.</title>
		<content>     by Vikki Taylor, aged 10.         
    My grandparents told me that the   
 town crest,{ONWARD},in front of the   
 Mount pavilion, long ago used to be   
 made up of flowering plants but you   
 could go into the pavilion to see the 
 Mount clock working and step out onto 
 the verandah to view the scenery.     
    The Mount cottage which is now used
 by the Citizens Advice Bureau used to 
 be a family house and the family had  
 to cross the passage to go to their   
 bedrooms.There were rose gardens in   
 front of an outdoor swimming pool and 
 by the paddling pool was a wooden hut 
 where daily puppet shows were given in
 the summer.                           
    In the pavilion by the rose garden,
 summer shows were given, and there was
 a roundabout where the car park is    
 now. Even so, my grandparents still   
 enjoy the view from Fleetwood's Mount.</content>
