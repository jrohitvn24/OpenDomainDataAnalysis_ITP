		<title>15THE SCHOOL - WEST MEON</title>
		<content>   Records of teaching exist from      
 1684.The present school, built in     
 1852, was endowed by Mary Touchet.    
   Until 1958 children attended this   
 school for all of their school life,  
 but since then have been receiving    
 secondary schooling at Petersfield.   
   First records show an average of 120
 on roll.The average is now 50, spread 
 over the same three rooms always used,
 and including children from Warnford, 
 Woodlands, Privett and Bramdean.      
   In 1940 provision of lunches        
 started, hot water in 1955, paper     
 towels in 1961 and central heating in 
 1964. In 1966 an office was built and 
 in 1980 a mezzanine was created to    
 make a library and room for staff,    
 television and working groups.        
   In 1985 39% of children walk to     
 school, 43% come by car, 10% come by  
 taxi and 8% come by bus.              </content>
