		<content>Yardley Hastings lies on the A428 road 
13 miles from Bedford and 8 miles from 
Northampton and is on the eastern      
border of Northamptonshire             
 The village has around 700            
inhabitants,and the cottages are built 
on either side of a small stream which 
flows alongside the main street and    
consequently the village has earned the
nickname of "Little Venice".The name   
Yardley Hastings comes from the Saxon  
word "Yard",meaning a clearing in the  
woods and "ley",meaning a permanent    
pasture ground.                        
 Over the last few years small farms   
have been amalgamated to create viable 
units,and the majority of the land is  
used for arable farming.               
 Close to the village is Yardley Chase,
a large area of forest with a history  
stetching back to the Norman rule of   
England.                               </content>
