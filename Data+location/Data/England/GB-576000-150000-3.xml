		<title>03LODDINGTON FARM</title>
		<content> Loddington Farm extends to over 160   
 acres. The owners, Mr and Mrs Smith,  
 live in a 19th century ragstone       
 farmhouse and are the fourth          
 generation of their family to farm    
 here. The top of the house affords a  
 wonderful view across the Weald to the
 south coast.                          
 The farm mainly produces fruit,-      
 apples, pears, damsons, blackcurrants,
 strawberries, and also mushrooms.     
 These are sold at Covent Garden and   
 other markets, and the strawberries   
 and blackcurrants, picked by a force  
 of up to 40 women, are on contract.   
 Two fields are growing corn this year 
 and willow wood is used to make       
 cricket bats when 16 years old.       
 The farm has 7 permanent men workers, 
 and the machinery includes 4 tractors,
 a fork-lift truck and spraying        
 machines.                             </content>
