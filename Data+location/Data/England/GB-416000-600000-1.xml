		<title>01Introduction to the Area.</title>
		<content> Most of the area is farmland. The     
 river Coquet runs through the South   
 perimeter of the area. There are      
 country walks by the river.Felton     
 village grew as a crossing point over 
 the river for the A1.There are two    
 bridges;an old pack horse bridge and a
 modern bridge. In 1981 a bypass was   
 opened and the A1 traffic now travels 
 West of Felton. Many of the old houses
 are built of stone and line the main  
 road. In 1939 Council houses were     
 built at the North end of the village 
 and in 1984 a new estate was built    
 further North. Some families have     
 lived in Felton for many generations. 
 There are many clubs,societies and    
 amenities established in Felton for   
 local people. The market towns of     
 Alnwick and Morpeth lie 15km to the   
 North and South respectively.
