		<content> Blackbushe Airport was constructed on 
 the common during the war for light   
 bombers.The airfield was used to      
 land the wounded,too.The runways were 
 on both sides of the A30 and traffic  
 had to stop to allow planes to take   
 off.After the war it became the       
 country's second largest airport as a 
 large number of holiday flights used  
 it. It continued in civil use until   
 1960.A museum of historic aircraft was
 started here.It is soon to be the site
 for truck and car auctions, at the    
 same time maintaining a runway for    
 light aircraft and flying school.     
 Caravans are also sold here and       
 drag races and a Sunday market are    
 held on this site.
