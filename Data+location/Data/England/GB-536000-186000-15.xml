		<title>15HACKNEY CARRIAGE DRIVER.</title>
		<content> We interviewed a London Cab Driver to 
 find out about his job. He said his   
 training took about 2years and in his 
 training he had to learn many routes, 
 street names,famous buildings,theatres
 ,hotels and other places.The number of
 routes that he covers is 90 to 130 a  
 week.No more than 4 passengers are    
 allowed inside a cab;this is one of   
 the Hackney Carriage Laws.            
 Some cabbies work nearly 50 hours each
 week.The cabbie that we spoke to      
 thought cab driving had changed little
 over the years.He said that he did not
 enjoy his job as he got bored and     
 lonely.His journey to work differs as 
 he said sometimes he has to drive 7   
 miles to work and sometimes only 1    
 mile.Some cabbies have to pay for the 
 diesel to fuel the cab;others don't   
 depending on whether the cab is his or
 not.                                  </content>
