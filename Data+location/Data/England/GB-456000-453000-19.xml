		<content> The Homestead is a large garden in    
 Clifton belonging to the Joseph       
 Rowntree Trust and is open to the     
 public.It is named after a farm where 
 Ouse Lea is now.Mr Alcorn the Rowntree
 Trust Head Gardener told us that it   
 cost about fifty to sixty thousand    
 pounds a year to run.The gardens have 
 been here about fifty years and       
 originally belonged to the house which
 is now Rowntree's European Office.The 
 Homestead has five full-time gardeners
 and eleven part-timers who work in    
 other areas also.As well as lawns,    
 trees, flower beds and picnic areas,  
 there are swings roundabouts and other
 amusements for children in the gardens
 .The Board of Trustees listen to the  
 ideas of the public and then decide   
 what amusements are provided.Mr Alcorn
 said that all kinds and ages of people
 come to the Homestead .               </content>
