     Each person kicks the ball once;  
 if it is kicked twice, kicked out of  
 the square, through a player's legs or
 touches his hands, he is 'set upon' by
 the other players until he leaves the 
 square. If a player catches the ball, 
 the person who kicked it to him has to
 run through a tunnel formed by the    
 other players, who kick him.          
{KERBY}- (2 players,large ball)        
    The ball is bounced against the    
 kerb, rebounds, and is caught for a   
 point. If it rebounds above your head 
 you double your score.

 ankles of two players standing apart. 
 A third player jumps in and out       
 calling "England, Ireland, Scotland,  
 Wales, Inside, Outside" .After ankles 
 the elastic is raised to the knees.   </content>
