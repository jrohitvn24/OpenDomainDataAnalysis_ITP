		<content> The area under study consists of      
 council house dwellings built in the  
 late 1950's.Visual evidence shows that
 some of the property is in            
 dis-repair.The population is          
 transitionary and one third of all    
 tenants are single parents(1981       
 census).{Wood End} is a comparitively 
 new community.Its street names are    
 taken from rural villages in          
 Warwickshire.Prior to the council     
 house programme the area was dominated
 by waste from two mines,the{Alexander}
 and the{Craven.}In some areas one can 
 see evidence of the "black pad".People
 who remember the area 30 years ago    
 told us of the building method used to
 construct the flats.Two tall pillars  
 of steel were erected into which      
 concrete was poured.This was allowed  
 to set and the windows,walls,floors   
 etc.,were built inside this shell.    </content>
