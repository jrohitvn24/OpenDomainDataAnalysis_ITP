		<title>14The Teapot Club Feast</title>
		<content> The{Flash Loyal Union Society}is      
 sometimes called the{Teapot}Club. Some
 people say it is called the Teapot    
 Club because they kept the money to   
 give to the sick people in a teapot.  
    Every year they have a club feast  
 in June. There is a banner with a     
 picture of baby Jesus on it. The      
 people walked behind the banner to the
 Travellers Rest, then they had a drink
 Then they walked back to the New Inn  
 and at 4.30 p.m they had a service at 
 the church. When the chapel was open, 
 they went to a church service then to 
 make it fair, the next year they went 
 to a chapel service. Then they came   
 back to the village hall for another  
 tea.
