		<content> CONCLUSION                            
 The Doomsday Book of 1086 makes no    
 mention of the Alston Moor district.  
 However,it seems likely that the lead 
 and silver mining recorded in Roman   
 times would still be active and       
 therefore supporting a community in   
 the area.                             
 Research based on comparisons of the  
 1971 and 1981 census figures,indicates
 that the area is becoming a more      
 attractive area in which to live: a   
 fact demonstrated by the number of    
 derelict properties now being         
 renovated. The disadvatages of harsh  
 climate and remoteness are becoming   
 less significant with improvments in  
 communications and technology. The    
 area is becoming increasingly         
 attractive to people looking for      
 holiday and weekend homes.
