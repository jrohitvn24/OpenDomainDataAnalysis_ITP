		<title>09WELLHOUSE MORAVIAN CHURCH</title>
		<content> I am a{Moravian,}one of 4000 in       
 Britain, in 1 of 42 congregations.    
 There are just over 500,000 in the    
 world. The church that I go to stands 
 in Wellhouse opposite my school. It   
 was built in 1970 after the older one,
{built in 1755,}was pulled down. A     
 small settlement of houses, which are 
 still standing, was built next to the 
 church for the congregation. The      
 Moravians set out from Moravia in     
{Bohemia,}that is how we got our name. 
 We were the first{heretics}to         
 officially leave the Church of Rome.  
 Our hymn book is one of the oldest in 
 the world. It was published in 1503.  
 There have been many{ministers}of our 
 church and at the moment it is Rev.   
 R.J.Hopcroft who has been minister now
 for 7 years. Normal services have     
 approximately 50 people in attendance 
 each Sunday.                          </content>
