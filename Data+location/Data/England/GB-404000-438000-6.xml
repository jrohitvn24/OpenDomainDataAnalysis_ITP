		<content>   I am a Muslim girl and I go to      
 Parkwood First School.  I am 9 years  
 old and I have{English, Punjabi,      
{Bengali, Chinese}and{Malaysian}friends
 there.  Our school building is about  
 100 years old and is situated on the  
 outskirts of Keighley, surrounded by  
 allotments, streets of terraced       
 houses and a wood on the hillside.    
 The children in our school come from  
 several different cultural and        
 religious backgrounds.  We celebrate  
 each other's festivals, thus sharing  
 each other's happiness and learning   
 about the way other people live.  We  
 celebrated the{Hindu}festival of      
{Diwali}by lighting our hall with      
 deevas (lamps made from clay) while   
 girls performed an Indian dance.  At  
 the{Christian}festival of{Christmas}we
 put up trimmings and a tree, sang     
 carols and had a party and presents.  </content>
