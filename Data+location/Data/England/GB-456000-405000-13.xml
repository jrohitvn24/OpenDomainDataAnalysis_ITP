		<title>13CHANGING SCHOOLS</title>
		<content>   I am dreading going to Don Valley   
 high School because I will meet a lot 
 of new teachers and strange people.   
   On the first day everybody who is   
 new will get lost because the school  
 is such a lot bigger than the one we  
 are at now.I will call for my friend  
 and we will catch the bus together.   
   My brother tells me you have some   
 boring subjects and some good         
 subjects.The most boring are          
 sewing,cooking,History,Science and    
 French.The best ones are              
 Art,Maths,Music and Drama.In Don      
 Valley you have to carry your bag with
 you.If you mess about then you get    
 detention.At the moment you have to   
 wear a uniform but this might change  
 when we start at the school.          
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
