		<title>08Abbotsley pond and Sign</title>
		<content> Hutchin's pond is near Rectory farm.  
 It used to be called the  village     
 watering  place when the horses used  
 to come off the field and  rinse their
 feet to make them clean again. Today  
 it is one of the village beauty spots.
 A man has made a duck house and he has
 put it in the pond to stop the fox    
 getting the ducks.The children often  
 go down to Hutchin's pond to feed the 
 ducks.It's got a thatched roof it came
 from one of the thatched houses in the
 village.Another interesting sight in  
 the village is the village sign It has
 four kings on it,because the  church  
 has four kings on the tower.Some of   
 the money to pay for the sign was     
 raised by coffee evenings held at     
 Church farm.It was unveiled by Mrs.   
 Flint because she is the oldest person
 in the village.
