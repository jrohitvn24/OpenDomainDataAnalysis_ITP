		<title>15INTERVIEW OF A POSTMAN,GRAYS</title>
		<content>  A Grays postman sits in Grays Park   
 eating his sandwiches;it is his lunch 
 break. On questioning him he tells us 
 that he gets up at 5am. every workday.
 He sets off for the main sorting      
 office in Grays, sorts his rounds     
 letters into bundles and sets off on  
 his bicycle to make his first of two  
 deliveries. He finds the bicycle very 
 useful because of his heavy, awkward  
 bag.                                  
  His main complaints about being a    
 postman are the rain, unfriendly dogs,
 and small,awkward letter boxes.       
  Asked if postal deliveries to the    
 home would some day be phased out he  
 tells us that he thinks that home     
 deliveries will continue for some     
 years although modern technology in   
 computers,and greater usage of the    
 telephone is bound to affect the      
 number of postmen required.           </content>
