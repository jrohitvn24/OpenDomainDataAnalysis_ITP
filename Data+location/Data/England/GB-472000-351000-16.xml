		<title>16Recreational activities.</title>
		<content> The major outdoor activity is coarse  
{fishing}in the River Trent but most of
 the participants are visitors to the  
 area. Other river associated pastimes 
 are boating, picnicking and walking.  
 The National Hunt{race course}at      
 Rolleston attracts both local people  
 and outsiders.                        
{Outdoor}pursuits are cricket, tennis, 
 football, cycling, walking, horse     
 riding, shooting and gardening.       
{Indoor}ones include socialising and   
 playing darts, dominoes and pool at   
 the local pubs, attending meetings of 
 the local clubs and taking part in    
 whist drives and church social events.
 Many people, especially children, have
 to travel outside the area for other  
 pursuits.                             
                                       
 A minority of people actually take    
 part in local organised activities.   </content>
