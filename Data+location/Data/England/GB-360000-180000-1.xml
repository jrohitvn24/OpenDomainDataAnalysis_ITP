		<content>   This block includes the suburbs of  
 Patchway,Little Stoke and Stoke       
 Gifford in the parishes of Patchway   
 and Stoke Gifford on the northern     
 fringe of Bristol.                    
   Little Stoke and Patchway were      
 largely built between 1930 and the    
 1950's to house workers in Rolls Royce
 and nearby British Aerospace. These   
 suburbs border the green belt of north
 Bristol which has remained unchanged  
 farmland until recently.              
   House building is now taking place  
 and the population has risen rapidly  
 since the 1971 census-Stoke Gifford   
 7,324 (+22%) Patchway 11,500 (+8%).   
   Partly because of its position near 
 the M4/M5 interchange, a major        
 development plan has been produced for
 the area which includes extensive     
 housing, high tech. industry and new  
 roads which will transform the area.  </content>
