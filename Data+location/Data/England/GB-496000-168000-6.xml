		<content> In 1904 Lord Fairhaven opened South-  
 gates training school.At Southgates   
 they have 26 horses.14 there,8 at Town
 Green and 4 at Burnham and other      
 farms.After we saw the horses we asked
 to look at the carriages and there    
 were 9 of them.Some of the carriages  
 were very old.The oldest carriage is  
 called the Landau and was built in    
 1880.The newest was built in 1913 and 
 it is called the Charabanc.5 people   
 look after the horses and there is one
 person to 5 horses.The largest horse  
 is 17 hands and the smallest is 9     
 hands.He is a Shetland Pony.The oldest
 horse is 20 and the oldest pony is 46.
 The most expensive horses are the     
 Australian cow ponies and they have   
 got a stallion.Some breeds of horses  
 are the Australian cow ponies,Shetland
 and Argentinians.
