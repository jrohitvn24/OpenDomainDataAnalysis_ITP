		<content> Although predominantly a{farming}     
 community,very few now work on the    
 farms,their labour replaced largely by
 machinery.The small businesses in the 
 village do not offer employment       
 opportunities though some require     
 part-time help.Most women with        
 children are housewives,though some   
 have part-time{work}as cleaners,      
 knitting machinists,factory workers,  
 insurance collectors.There are 4 women
 employed full-time.The men have varied
{jobs}e.g.garage mechanics,builders,   
 hauliers,river inspectors,engineers &amp; 
 gas/oil rig workers.About 25% of the  
 village are retired people.We are     
 fortunate that only 3 men in Denton   
 are unemployed.There are a few self   
 -employed people as well.             
 Most people use{banks}in Bungay or    
 Harleston,though the Giro-bank is     
 available through the Post-Office.    </content>
