		<title>05Sheep in rural Sowerby</title>
		<content>    Only two of the farmers in our     
 block had a significant number of     
 sheep. One had a flock of 120 Suffolk 
 Cross which are bought in in October  
 and sold after about six months. They 
 are fattened off grass with arable    
 waste in winter i.e. sugar beet tops, 
 potatoes, and sugar beet pulp.        
    Another farmer carries 80 ewes, the
 lambs from which are also fattened and
 sold for meat  at 38 kilos at about   
 Â£1.25  per kilo.                      
    The farmer's wife keeps about 5    
 Jacob's ewes and breeds from them with
 a Suffolk tup to get black lambs,     
 which again go on to the meat         
 market.An acre of grass supports 5    
 ewes.                                 
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
