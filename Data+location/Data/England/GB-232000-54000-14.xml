		<content> THE AREA IS PATROLLED BY POLICE PANDA 
 CARS FROM TORPOINT.999 CALLS GO       
 THROUGH LAUNCESTON,BUT POLICE CLAIM   
 THAT THEY CAN BE ON THE SCENE WITHIN  
 TWENTY MINUTES OF BEING CALLED. MOST  
 INCIDENTS CONSIST OF ROAD ACCIDENTS   
 AND PETTY THEFT, WITH OCCASIONAL      
 RUSTLING OF LIVESTOCK AND SOME DRUG   
 OFFENCES.                             
   THE ROAD FROM TRIFFLE TO CRAFTHOLE  
 (AND THENCE TO TREGANTLE) HAS BEEN    
 DESIGNATED A CLEARWAY- THE ONLY ONE IN
 THE DISTRICT. THIS HAS CAUSED         
 CONTROVERSY AMONG THOSE WISHING TO    
 PARK TO DESCEND TO THE NUDIST BEACH   
 AT COLEADON POINT,AND OTHER COVES.    
   SPEEDING THROUGH POLBATHIC HAS      
 RESULTED IN BAD ACCIDENTS- TWO DEATHS 
 IN THE PAST YEAR.RE-MARKING AND       
 ERECTING OF BOLLARDS, NOW IN PROGRESS,
 WILL HOPEFULLY IMPROVE THE SITUATION.
