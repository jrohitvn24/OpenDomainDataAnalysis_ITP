They had to run round the outside of   
the village for five miles.  The       
children ran for two miles on the      
playing field.  Everyone who took part 
got a medal.                           
PLAYING FIELD FETE                     
Every year in June the fete is held on 
the playing field.  A little ring is   
roped off and this is for the children 
from the school to do their plays or   
songs.                                 
There are races and there is a fancy   
dress competition. There are about     
twenty-five different stalls.  You     
can have pony rides and there is face  
painting.  There is a car boot sale    
too. They set out some tables and      
chairs and you can have refreshments   
which are made in the pavillion on the 
playing field.
