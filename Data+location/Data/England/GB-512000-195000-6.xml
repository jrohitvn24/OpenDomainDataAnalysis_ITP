		<title>06The Spiders Web Motel</title>
		<content> This motel is located in square       
 05140196 and is sited on approximately
 30acres alongside the A41 trunk road. 
 A hotel of the same name was destroyed
 by fire about l5 years ago and the    
 present motel replaces it. There are  
 110 rooms on 4 floors, several        
 function suites, a fitness room and a 
 swimming pool in an uninspiring       
 building of brick, steel and glass.   
 Along with the Ladbroke Mercury Hotel 
 in square 05130197 The Spiders Web    
 looks to travelling businessmen using 
 the A41 and M1 for its residential    
 custom (Junction 5 of the M1 is 1 mile
 NE). In l985 it charges between Â£25   
 and Â£40 per night for a room. The     
 motel looks to busineses promotions   
 and company functions to supplement   
 its income.
