		<title>14  A Wolverhampton Market</title>
		<content>Wednesfield Market is in the centre of 
the town. It opens on Tuesdays,Fridays 
and Saturdays. Everybody seems to use  
the market and you always meet friends 
there. There are 61 stalls and 8 shops.
Sellers come from all over the Midlands
from Brownhills, Sedgeley, Wellington, 
Stourbridge, Kinswinford and even as   
far away as Coventry. The market opened
on its present site in June 1970. The  
council moved it from one side of      
Alfred Squire Road to the other. It had
been on its first site since the       
council began the market 1961. A man   
called Councillor S.Reynolds did a lot 
to get the idea of a Wednesfield market
started in the town. The market has a  
superintendent to look after everthing 
and even a cafe for the stallholders   
and shoppers.
