		<content> The Undercliff used to consist mainly 
 of grazing land,and for hundreds of   
 years there seems to have been very   
 few trees,but much low scrub,until    
 in the 1790's the Arnolds of Mirables 
 planted an orchard and other trees;   
 in the 1820's the Willoughby Gordons  
 of The Orchard also planted extensive-
 ly.Oaks,Holm Oaks and Scyamore are now
 colonising,but the recent loss of Elm 
 trees has greatly reduced the wood-   
 land.Regrettably much of the open land
 has now been built over.The drystone  
 walls which border the Undercliff Road
 and many of the fields,are now almost 
 the last remaining in the Island;un-  
 fortunately they do not stand up well 
 to the vibration of the increasingly  
 heavy traffic, and they were also     
 badly damaged during the last war by  
 tanks and other vehicles.
