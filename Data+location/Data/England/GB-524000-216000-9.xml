		<title>09TRANSPORT IN WOOLMER GREEN</title>
		<content> The old A1 main road runs through     
{Woolmer Green }and is still a busy    
 road with {500}vehicles passing       
 through an hour. The motorway which   
 passes through the area and has       
 by_passed the village is the          
 A1(M),this has over {1200}vehicles    
 pass each hour.The A1(M) is the main  
 London to Scotland road. The main     
 railway line from Kings Cross to      
 Edinburgh passes to the West of the   
 village with the nearest station      
 1.6 km away in Knebworth. Buses pass  
 regularly through the village to      
 Potters Bar or Stevenage and provide  
 a half a hourly service through the   
 day. Children from secondary schools  
 have coaches or use the public bus    
 service because the nearest secondary 
 school is too far away to walk.
