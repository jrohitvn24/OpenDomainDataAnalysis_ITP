		<title>19IBTHORPE - VILLAGE</title>
		<content> Horseshoe Lane in{Ibthorpe}is the site
 of a mediaeval village, and is a      
 mixture of very old and new houses.   
 The old houses which remain  each have
 their original 'strip' of land. New   
 houses have been built across 'strips'
 vacated when the original wattle and  
 daub cottages disappeared with time.  
 At one end of Horseshoe Lane is the   
 Bank Tree. This has been a meeting    
 place since Saxon times. At the       
 beginning of this century, the bank   
 was maintained and the tree pollarded.
 The wood was given to the local people
 It is also possible that farm workers 
 gathered at the Bank Tree to receive  
 their pay. The Methodist Chapel held  
 open air services there on Sunday     
 evenings in summer within living      
 memory.
