		<content>{Wildlife}flourishes in our area       
 because trees, hedges and vegetation  
 are abundant. We have seen 27         
 different kinds of birds.The rarest is
 the{kestrel}which we see over the     
 Pegsdon hills and by the{bell tower}of
 Hexton church. The goldcrest is       
 another rare visitor. We frequently   
 observe blackbirds and sparrows. A    
 pair of house martins nest under the  
 school porch. Squirrels are common and
 moles frequently dig runs across      
 playing fields  and gardens. Rabbits  
 and hares thrive in the fields,       
 particularly in the nature reserves. A
 flock of sheep is kept in the hills   
 and one of rare breeds is  kept in    
 the area. Bury farm has a herd of beef
 cattle and some dairy cows. Most      
 farmers keep dogs, cats,chickens and  
 horses for riding.
