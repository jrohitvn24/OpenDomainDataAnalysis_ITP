		<title>04 The Ragley Hall Gamekeeper</title>
		<content>  The gamekeeper of Ragley Hall is     
Mr.Ward.His year's work is split into  
three seasons:                         
1.From the 1st of February to about the
middle of May he feeds the birds in the
wild and catches and kills vermin ie.  
foxes,rats,stoats,weasels etc.         
2.Mid May to the middle of September he
rears partridges and pheasants and     
releases them into the fields.He rears 
2300 pheasants and 1200                
partridges.Pheasants go to the woods at
seven weeks old.Partridges go at twelve
weeks.                                 
3.Mid September to the end of January  
he feeds the birds in the woods and    
fields and a syndicate of guns starts  
shooting them.Each year there is an    
average of about 1200 pheasants killed 
and 600 partridges killed.The guns pay 
a cash sum to cover rent of ground,    
gamekeeper's wages,chicks and feed.    </content>
