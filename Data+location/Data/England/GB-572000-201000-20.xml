		<title>20GROVE FARM SANDON CHELMSFORD</title>
		<content>   Grove Farm has 307 acres of land. It
 is both a dairy and an arable farm.   
 Wheat is grown there.They employ two  
 bird scarers to shoot the birds which 
 eat the seed.They have three tractors 
 and a combine harvester.The cows have 
 their calves in the spring and they   
 become upset when their calves are    
 taken away.The cows can live up to    
 eighteen years but the usual age is   
 between ten and fifteen years.They are
 fed and cleaned out at 6.30 a.m and   
 fed again at 5.30 p.m.The farmer's six
 hundred pigs are now at East          
 Hanningfield.These are slaughtered    
 when they are at least seventeen weeks
 old.They are fed on a ration of nuts  
 once a day.Right beside the farmhouse 
 is a woodland area which is kept for  
 wildlife.They do not have hedges      
 around their fields but some fences.
