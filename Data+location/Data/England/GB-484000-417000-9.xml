		<title>09The Nypro Explosion 2</title>
		<content> In May 1974 I had been teaching at    
 Burton School for six weeks and was   
 visiting relatives when news of the   
 explosion was flashed on to the T.V.  
 screen.When I returned home the next  
 day I could see the flames and I live 
 some 20 km from Flixborough.I was     
 unable to contact anyone by           
 telephone."The area has been evacuated
 .It's like a scene from a war         
 film,"said the operator.The scale of  
 the damage was quite stunning.In      
 school 165 panes of glass were        
 broken,some glass was found impaled in
 the wall opposite the broken window.My
 own classroom was directly in line and
 one of the nearest yet suffered no    
 damage -seven books were on the       
 floor.The children's education was    
 interrupted for a week.My lasting     
 memory is the noise made when one     
 walks on broken glass.                </content>
