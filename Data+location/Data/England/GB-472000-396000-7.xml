 ECOLOGY                               
 IN LITTLE BROOMSTONE AREA A COAL SEAM 
 CAN BE LOCATED THREE OR FOUR FEET     
 BELOW GROUND LEVEL.  EXPERIMENTAL BORE
 HOLES FOR OIL RECENTLY LSUNK AT       
 LANGHOLME.  SEISMOLOGY TEST CARRIED   
 OUT ON THE SITE OF LHAXEY GRANGE.  THE
 FIELDS ARE BOUNDED BY DRAINS  WHICH   
 ARE KEPT IN GOOD REPAIR EITHE4 BY THE 
 FARMERS THEMSELVES OR BY DRAINAGE     
 BOARDS, WHO MAKE REGULAR INSPECTIONS. 
 FOR THIS SERVICE THE FARMERS PAY      
 APPROXIMATELY Â£3 _ Â£4 PER ACRE>  WITH 
 SUCH EFFICIENT DRAINAGE&lt; THE WZATER   
 LEVEL IN SOME PARTS HAS DROPED SO     
 MUCH&lt; THAT IRRIGATION HAS TO BE       
 INSTIGATED. THE PEAT BOG AREA IN THE  
 REGION OF HAXEY GRANGE HAS ALMOST     
 DRIED UP. AT MISTERTON CARR FARM      
 DRAINAGE HAS MADE A MOST VALUABLE AND 
 REMUNERATIVE IMPROVEMEMT TO FARMING.  </content>
