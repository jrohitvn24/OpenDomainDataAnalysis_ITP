		<content> In winter Hedon Growers import Spanish
  cucumbers.Hedon Growers was          
 established at Burstwick and it was at
 Hedon too,where they grow tomatoes and
 cucumbers.When Hedon Growers was at   
 Hedon and Burstwick,Burstwick grew    
 tomatoes but they got a disease in the
 second season.In 1985 Hedon Growers   
 decided to change their oil boilers to
 coal after they had been on oil for 15
 years or more because coal is cheaper 
 than oil.Hedon Growers boilers are    
 finished but there is still the       
 landscaping to do.East Coast Salads is
 now the transporting agency which     
 takes the cucumbers all over the      
 country.The employment at Hedon       
 Growers is 104 people.
