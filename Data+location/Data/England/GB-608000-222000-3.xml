		<content> THE CHURCH WAS ORIGINALLY BUILT IN    
 1125 AND THE PORCH WAS ADDED IN 1340. 
 THE TOWER BELONGING TO THE CHURCH WAS 
 DEMOLISHED IN 1969 AS IT HAD BECOME   
 UNSAFE OVER THE YEARS.HOWEVER,SOME SAY
 THAT THE COLCHESTER EARTHQUAKE OF 1884
 CAUSED SOME OF THE DAMAGE TO THE      
 TOWER.IT TOOK TWO MEN TWO WEEKS TO    
 DESTROY THE BASE OF THE TOWER WHICH   
 HAD WALLS 6 FOOT THICK.               
     THE OWNER OF THE CHURCH,AN        
 INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER WHO HAS CONVERTED 
 THE CHURCH INTO A PRIVATE HOUSE HAS A 
 WORKSHOP AND STUDIO.THE WORKSHOP IS IN
 THE CHANCEL AREA AND THE STUDIO IN THE
 ROOF OF THE CHURCH WHICH IS NOW A     
 LOFT.                                 
     THE "GARDEN" AREA AROUND THE      
 CHURCH IS STILL A GRAVEYARD! THE      
 GRAVESTONES HAVE TO REMAIN THERE, BY  
 LAW FOR 50 YEARS.
