		<content> There are three farms with dairy      
 units. Oveney Green Farm exports      
 in-calf pure-bred Fresian heifers to  
 the European market where there is a  
 great demand.  Store cattle are reared
 and fattened for markets in the South 
 East. One farm has a flock of 400 mule
 crossbred sheep with about 9 rams,    
 another flock are crossbred with Texal
 rams. There is a smallholding with    
 pigs. Small numbers of sheep are kept 
 in private paddocks and one family    
 that breed pigs for their own use also
 keep chicken, ducks and turkeys and   
 have a calf to fatten for meat, and   
 goats for their own milk.  There are  
 two chicken farmers, one of whom      
 delivers eggs locally.  The Chevening 
 Estate has a forestry unit, conifers, 
 cherry, oak and beech are the main    
 species planted. They also rear       
 pheasants.                            </content>
