		<content> In Callington carpark, it is not Pay  
 and Display so it free. The carpark is
 right next to{Callington Primary      
{School.}At the bottom of it there is a
 way to go in and a way to go out,     
 called the Entrance and Exit, and you 
 must use them properly. At the top    
 there is a Scout Headquaters. In front
 of it is some builders materials and a
 Dingy which is usually there, unless  
 it is being used. Behind the hut there
 is a cricket field and to one side of 
 it there is a road leading to some    
 houses. In front of the hut with the  
 dinghy there are some removal vans.   
 Out of the carpark on one side is     
 some farming machines. On the other   
 side of there is our school and by the

 were laid down when it was            
 re-surfaced. In the carpark there are 
 130 spaces.                           </content>
