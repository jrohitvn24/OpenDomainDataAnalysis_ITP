		<content>{B.J.Waters }have thirty five lorries  
 altogether.These lorries carry any    
 tippable things from coal to apples   
 all around the country.The boss of the
 firm is now {Tim Waters.}It used      
 to be his dad, {Bernard John,}who     
 started the firm back in 1956.Some    
 lorry drivers travel 300-800 miles in 
 an eight hour day.The lorries,which   
 are mostly{Seddon Atkinson,}can get up
 to a top speed of sixty m/p/h.On their
 day trip the lorry drivers can get    
 quite peckish so they take their own  
 food or stop at cafes.In the twenty   
 nine years the firm has been going    
 they have had some accidents,but none 
 of them serious.The firm only uses    
 lorries because you can't tip with    
 things like vans!Because of insurance 
 it is a firm rule that the drivers    
 must not pick up hitch-hikers or take 
 companions with them on their trips.  </content>
