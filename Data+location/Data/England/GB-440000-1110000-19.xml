		<content>   The first landing strip was built at
 Sumburgh in 1933 because of the flat  
 land. In 1934 the first flight from   
 Aberdeen was made with three          
 commercial travellers as passengers.  
 But they never made schedule flights  
 until one year later.                 
  The airport was expanded and a new   
 terminal built for the North Sea Oil  
 Rig workers in 1978. However, when    
 the long range helicopters were       
 introduced this terminal became       
 underused and it was opened to the    
 general public.                       
  In 1984 75263 people went through the
 airport and 320 planes on average     
 landed per week. Also 105 private     
 planes came and went.                 
  An air_sea rescue service is run by  
 Bristow Helicopters in conjunction    
 with the Coastguards. In drastic      
 emergencies British Airways also help.</content>
