		<content> The tower of St James the Great at    
 Longburton dated from the mid l3th    
 century with typical Early English    
 lancet windows.  The bell chamber     
 containing four bells was added in the
 l6th or l7th century.                 
 The latest portion of the church is   
 the North aisle added in l873 when    
 more seating accommodation was        
 needed. The population of Longburton  
 was then at its highest water mark.   
 The north chapel was built in the     
 early l7th century and contains two   
 impressive canopied monuments.  One is
 to Sir John Fitzjames and his wife    
 Joan and the other to Thomas Winston, 
 his son and wife.                     
 A project to recover the church       
 kneelers with canvas embroidery was   
 started in l976 by Mrs Carsan and     
 these were dedicated by Bishop Pike in
 l978.l2                               </content>
