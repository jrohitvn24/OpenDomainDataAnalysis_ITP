		<title>20FINDING OUT ABOUT FELTWELL</title>
		<content>   The information about Feltwell was  
 collected by the children of Edmund de
 Moundeford School, mostly nine or ten 
 years old.                            
   We talked to prominent people in the
 village also businesspeople  and      
 ordinary residents. We talked to about
 ten percent of the residents.         
   We went out and looked carefully at 
 each of our kilometre squares, helped 
 by people who knew them well. Almost  
 all of the people we talked to  were  
 very helpful but some of them  could  
 not understand what we were doing.    
   About the village people said "A    
 nice quiet place to live"  "More      
 entertainment needed for all ages"    
 A few thought the place was dirty and 
 some living nearer Hockwold didn't    
 like co-operating with Feltwell       
 School.                               
                                       </content>
