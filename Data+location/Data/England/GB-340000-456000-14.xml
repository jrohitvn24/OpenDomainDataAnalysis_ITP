		<content>The old families of the parish,who can 
trace their ancestry back for 300 years
or so,are now outnumbered by 2nd and   
3rd generation villagers and newcomers.
Many of the older generation regret the
villageÂ£s growth and development,which 
threaten the character of the village, 
and increase the traffic flow.Though   
the rural charm has altered,the        
community spirit has been kept alive,  
and there are more opportunities for   
both young and old.The elders deplore  
the behaviour and lack of respect of   
some of the younger generation and     
their parents,they dislike the poor bus
service,the lack of a local surgery,or 
chemistÂ£s shop.Some people worry about 
the proximity of the Nuclear Power     
Plant,the number of stray dogs,and the 
materialistic outlook of many young    
people in the area.
