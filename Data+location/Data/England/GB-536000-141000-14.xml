		<content> Railway. Lingfield British Rail       
 Station has an hourly service to      
 Victoria or London Bridge via Oxted   
 and East Croydon to the North and East
 Grinstead in the south. Many people   
 travel by train to work.              
 Bus. The area is served by 6 London   
 Country bus routes and a Royal Mail   
 Post Bus.                             
 There are four taxi/car hire firms in 
 the area.                             
 Most people questioned had the regular
 use of a car, many homes having at    
 least two.                            
  Lingfield is on the flight path to   
 Gatwick Airport and on average 14     
 aeroplanes an hour pass directly      
 overhead. The noise can be disturbing 
 but as the airport provides employment
 for many local residents people       
 questioned thought this was a nuisance
 they soon became accustomed to.       </content>
