The predominant land cover in this area
is rough grazing, but most farms are   
mixed.  There are fields of grain,     
mainly wheat, some of potatoes and some
more intensively managed grassland,    
though few cattle were to be seen.     
There were some areas where hay had    
been cut, but most of the pasture      
seemed rough grazing land, either      
enclosed or meadowland alongside the   
brooks.                                
                                       
Some of the farms were freehold, others
were tenant farms of the major land    
owners, for example Stretton farm, just
outside this area.
