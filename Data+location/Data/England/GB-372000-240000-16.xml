		<content>{ The Wyche and Colwall Horticultural  
{Society}evolved from a Home and Garden
 Show, first held in August 1942 at The
 Hill Institute, Upper Colwall. The    
 show continued on an annual basis and 
 outgrew its hillside home to move     
 first to a tented site at The Downs   
 School and more recently to the       
 gymnasium at The Elms School. The     
 enthusiasts who organised the show    
 formed the society in 1967, so that   
 gardeners in Colwall and the          
 surrounding area could gain even more 
 interest and pleasure from their      
 hobby. Monthly meetings are held from 
 Ocober to June, at which speakers     
 (often of national repute, e.g. Percy 
 Thrower) provide the members with much
 helpful information about every       
 conceivable gardening topic. The      
 society currently has 200 members.    
 Garden visits and events are arranged.</content>
