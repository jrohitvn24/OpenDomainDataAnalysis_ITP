 This block covers a rural area on     
 the western slopes of the Pennines in 
 northern England, embracing two small 
 villages of Murton and Hilton  and the
 hamlet of Brackenber. The area is part
 of the Eden valley, some 15 miles     
 outside the Lake District National    
 Park. The Eden valley has its         
 attractions for holidaymakers but     
 tourism  plays a lesser role in       
 day-to-day life to that of farming,   
 which is the economic support for many
 families.                             
 These fellside villages have their own
 patterns of life, but local people are
 involved in activities beyond their   
 own boundaries, too.
