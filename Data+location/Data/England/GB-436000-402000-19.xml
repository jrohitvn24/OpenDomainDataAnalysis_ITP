		<title>19CHURCHES AND CHAPELS</title>
		<content> ON THE TRIP ROUND OUR AREA WE COUNTED 
 9 CHURCHES AND 5 CHAPELS BUT THERE ARE
 MORE BECAUSE WE DIDN'T GO ALONG EVERY 
 STREET. THE NEAREST CHURCH TO THE     
 SCHOOL IS WORSBRO' DALE ST. THOMAS,   
 AND AFTER WE HAD  MADE ENQUIRIES ROUND
 SCHOOL WE WENT TO SEE THE VICAR TO    
 RAISE SOME POINTS WITH HIM. IN SCHOOL,
 OUT OF 215 CHILDREN, ONLY 16 ATTENDED 
 CHURCH OR CHAPEL REGULARLY; 74 COULD  
 NOT REMEMBER EVER GOING TO A SERVICE  
 OF ANYSORT; 84 COULD REMEMBER GOING TO
 A CHRISTENING OR A WEDDING. MANY      
 THOUGHT CHURCHES  AND CHAPELS WERE FOR
 CAROL SERVICES, SEEING JESUS ON THE   
 CROSS, PRAYING TO GOD, CHRISTING      
 SERVICES AND WEDDINGS, AND THAT       
 VICARS, PRIESTS, NUNS, JESUS, ROBIN   
 HOOD, CHRISTIANS AND WORSHIPPERS USED 
 THEM AS WELL AS THOSE WHO WANTED TO   
 TALK TO GOD TO THANK HIM OR GET RID OF
 THEIR SINS.                           </content>
