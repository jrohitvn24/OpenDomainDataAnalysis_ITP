 service{industries}and only 10% in    
 manufacturing. Canterbury attracts a  
 large proportion (50%) of workers from
 elsewhere in Kent. Another feature of 
{employment}is the large proportion    
 (42%) of{jobs}occupied by females.38% 
 of women work less than 30 hours per  
 week. Male employment is found in the 
 professional and technical sector,    
 followed by sales, then engineering   
 then transport and communication -    
 these account for 50% of jobs. Female 
 employment is concentrated in four    
 areas, - clerical jobs, sales         
 assitants,{services}and professional  
 and technical occupations.

 elsewhere, and the main areas for job 
 growth are seen to exist in retailing,
 recreation,tourism,education,&amp; health.
