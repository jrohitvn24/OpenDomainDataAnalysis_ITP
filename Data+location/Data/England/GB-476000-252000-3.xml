		<content> The parish church dedicated to St.    
 Peter and St. Paul is 900 years old   
 though the font is Saxon. The north   
 pillars and South door are Norman     
 whilst the Chancel and south porch are
 14th century and the tower, which has 
 a ring of five bells, is 15th Century.
 The church had a very high pulpit and 
 box pews but these were removed during
 19th Century modernisation. The names 
 and dates of the Rectors and Patrons  
 are recorded since 1272.              
 Notable features of the church include
 the leper window, which allowed lepers
 to partake in the service without     
 entering the church; the organ,       
 renovated in 1981  which stands on the
 Wake family vault; and the busts of   
 Sir Samuel Jones &amp; his wife, who gave 
 the village its school in 1680.
