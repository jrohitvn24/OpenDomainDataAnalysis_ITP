		<content> Leintwardine has changed little over  
 the years.The school was built in 1845
 then it became a playschool. Now it is
 a Community Centre.The village library
 is based there and it will be used    
 for a youth club and other activities.
 A small street called {Rosemary}has   
 changed a lot.Fifty years ago it was  
 just fields now it's a small estate of
 bungalows and houses and a lot of old 
 people live there.The main street,{   
{Watling Street,}has changed as well.  
 There were more shops then there are  
 now.There was a{cobbler's, a          
{watchmaker's and a draper's shop.}In  
 other parts of the  village there used
 to be a {baker's a grocers, a         
{chemist's, a saddler's, a sweet shop  
{and a biycycle.}Now there are only 4  
 shops.The population has increased but
 they have to travel elsewhere for most
 of their shopping.                    </content>
