		<content> There are only a few houses in this   
 sparsely populated area. There are a  
 number of older farmhouses. An        
 interesting farmhouse is Lovington    
 Farm to the north of the block,a large
 red-brick structure.Typical building  
 materials are brick with flints.(the  
 underlying rock is chalk). Hampage    
 farmhouse is unoccupied.Other than the
 farmers and their workers,most of the 
 population of the area is mixed. Some 
 of the older cottages are owned by    
 retired couples or people who work in 
 Winchester or beyond. The cost of a   
 17th century house varies. At the     
 moment we cannot find one which is 'on
 the market'. We estimate the current  
 price of such a period house to be    
 anything above Â£80,000.
