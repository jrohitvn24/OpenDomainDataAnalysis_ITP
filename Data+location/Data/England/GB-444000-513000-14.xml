		<content> Thornaby housing is of two different  
 types, council houses and private     
 houses. The two areas are separated by
 a main road.The council houses are    
 less well built than the private      
 houses,they have no trees around them 
 and no front gardens.The council      
 tenants must seek permission to paint 
 or alter their property.Most council  
 houses have flat roofs which let in   
 rain and isn't very efficient.The     
 council houses are mainly             
 terraced.Private houses are either    
 semi detached or detached.They have   
 their own gardens,garages,pleasant    
 surroundings and more space.The       
 private estate has many trees and is  
 clean and tidy.The only shops are in  
 the council estate.The children gather
 around the shops and disturb the      
 council house tenants.The private     
 tenants don't have these problems.    </content>
