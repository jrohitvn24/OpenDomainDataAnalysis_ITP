		<content> On Saturday I got up early, to go     
 gliding. My mum took me to the end of 
 West Fen Lane to wait to be picked up 
 to go gliding with the scouts. The    
 scout leaders wife picked my friend   
 and I up at 8.30 am and took us to st 
 Rubby air field. We helped to get     
 the gliders ready ,then walked to the 
 runway while the winch was prepared.  
 A winch is something which            
 pulls the glider into the air.I was   
 scared when I first went up,but when I
 got used to it,I enjoyed it.          
 After we had finished gliding we went 
 home for lunch.After lunch I played   
 outside with my friend.In the evening 
 I got changed. My uncle and aunt were 
 taking us for a meal and to see the   
 Grumbleweeds.They were everso good.We 
 went home at 12.10 am .I was very     
 tired. I went straight to bed.
