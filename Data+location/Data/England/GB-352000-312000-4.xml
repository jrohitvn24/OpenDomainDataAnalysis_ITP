		<title>04St. Lucia's Church.</title>
		<content> St Lucia's church is believed to have 
 existed in the 12th centuary , which  
 makes the church 800 years old .      
   St. Lucia's church has a square     
 tower which is 18m (59 ft 9ins) high .
   It is a solid building with         
 buttresses on the outside of the      
 walls.These support the walls to keep 
 them straight and secure.  The breadth
 of the church is approx 12m long and  
 the length is approx 32m long , the   
 area of the church covers approx 384  
 sq.m. The area of the church yard is  
 approx 4384sq.m. The iron bit         
 going up the isle is called a grill . 
 Underneath the grill there is a hole  
 in the floor which leads down to the  
 old heating for the church .  In the  
 west end of the church lying in the   
 vestry is a memorial of Walter Barker.
 He is dressed in Elizabethan          
 armour.                               </content>
