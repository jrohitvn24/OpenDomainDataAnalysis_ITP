		<title>01Elburton &amp; Brixton Villages</title>
		<content> The block covers part of the suburban 
 and rural areas on the east side of   
 Plymouth and in particular encompasses
 the two villages of Elburton and      
 Brixton.  Elburton is part of the     
 parish of Plymstock and is just within
 the Plymouth city boundary. Much of   
 the farmland which once surrounded    
 Elburton village is now covered by the
 housing estates of such developers as 
 Wimpey, Fletcher and Brosley. However 
 the established horticultural glass   
 industry still survives as does the   
 large working quarry at Billacombe.   
 In contrast the South Hams parish of  
 Brixton has retained its rural        
 character with its several dairy and  
 mixed farms. Some private house       
 building has taken place and there is 
 some current building but so far,     
 ribbon development between the two    
 villages has not yet occured.         </content>
