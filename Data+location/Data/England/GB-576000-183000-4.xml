		<title>04Canvey - Transport</title>
		<content> Most of the transport that comes      
 through our area are cars, they come  
 in different shapes and sizes. The    
 most popular cars that I see are      
 Cortinas and the Escorts.There are    
 two main types of buses the double    
 decker bus and the coach.The coach is 
 the most popular out of the two.There 
 is normally about half an hour gap    
 between each bus, that comes. The two 
 taxi services are trio, the A.B.C. and
 Steve's every day there is normally a 
 few vans about.The most common van is 
 the industrial van but there are      
 others such as the post office van,   
 plumbers van and the builders van.
