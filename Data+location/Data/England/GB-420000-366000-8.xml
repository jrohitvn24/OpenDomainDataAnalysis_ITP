		<title>08Well Dressings</title>
		<content>     In Carnival Week in  July  each   
 year, the{Well Dressings} are  held   
 in Bakewell.   The  dressings  take   
 about a week to make and consist of   
 petals, leaves,  seeds  and  gravel   
 pressed   into   clay   to  form  a   
 picture. The pictures that decorate   
 the wells sometimes show  a part of   
 Bakewell  or a  village nearby,  or   
 more  often have a religious theme.   
     Once in  position, the Blessing   
 of the Wells  takes place, when the   
 Vicar goes to each well in turn and   
 performs a  blessing. This ceremony   
 attracts  a  very  large  number of   
 spectators.                           
     The tradition of  Well Dressing   
 goes back to {Pagan times,}when the   
 wells were  decorated with  flowers   
 as a thanksgiving.
