		<title>15A VISIT TO THE R.O.F.</title>
		<content>   A group of eight children visited   
 this factory on Friday June 14th and  
 were given a talk and a guided tour of
 the area. The site covers 430 acres   
 so there are less than 2 people per   
 acre of land.The men get around the   
 site on bicycles.There are 300        
 bicycles and one man is{employed}to   
 repair them all.                      
   The mounds are built around the     
 parts of factory which contain        
{explosives.The factory makes rocket   
{propellent.}Much of the produced      
 material is{transported by means of a 
{narrow guage railway.Waste is often   
 burnt and bangs can be heard when     
 materials are tested.There are 500    
 buildings,all of them are spread out  
 to reduce the chance of continuous    
 reaction.{Nitric Acid and Hexamine}   
 solution are used and large cooling   
 towers are very much in evidence.     </content>
