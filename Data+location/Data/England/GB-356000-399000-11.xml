		<title>11LEISURE &amp; RECREATION A-IN-M</title>
		<content> In Ashton there are a lot of leisure  
 facilities for the young and old.  The
 Leisure Centre provides entertainment 
 for both.  There are the two swimming 
 pools, small and large.  There are    
 also squash and badminton courts      
 which can be hired for a reasonable   
 price.  Also judo and gymnastic       
 groups are open.  Around Ashton       
 there are organisations such as Boys  
 Brigade, cubs, brownies and guides.   
                                       
 In Ashton there is also the Three     
 Sisters Recreation Area.  Here they   
 have a lake for canoeing and          
 windsurfing.  A BMX track has been    
 built which is fun for the kids.  In  
 another part of the grounds there     
 is the racing track where go-cart     
 and motorbike races are held. It is   
 like the countryside so you can have  
 long or short walks.                  </content>
