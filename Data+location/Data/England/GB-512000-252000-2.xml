		<title>02Farming around Great Barford</title>
		<content> Farming today is highly mechanised    
 with machinery to do every thing.     
 Crops are set and harvested by        
 machines. Grain is stored in huge bins
 and dried by blowing warm air though  
 it.Most of the grain in this area is  
 top quality and sold for seeds all    
 over the world.The majority of crops  
 are cereal.Two of the newest crops    
 which are grown profusely are tick    
 beans for animal food and rape seed   
 which produces oil for margarine and  
 cosmetics.                            
           There are still tenant      
 farmers who have small holdings       
 growing market garden produce but     
 unfortunatly these are disappearing as
 they are being takenover by large     
 farming syndicates.                   
           Sheep and cattle are reared 
 for their meat and are grazed on the  
 hilly meadows by the river.           </content>
