 is going to be a Country Dancing      
 display and a Gymnastics display.     
 There are refreshments in the canteen 
 and some stalls (such as White        
 Elephant, games, records, and posters 
 and  badges, plants, painted stones,  
 purses and books).                    
 THURSDAY-I had Highly Commended for my
 sweets last night. It is market day   
 today. Tonight it is Youth Club. It   
 starts at 6.30pm and finishes at      
 8.30pm. At Youth Club we play games   
 and go places. We play games like hit 
 or football and sometimes we go for   
 walks or have a mini-bus to go        
 to places like Laneka.                
 FRIDAY-It is the last school day today
 before the weekend. After school I    
 play with my sister and watch         
 television. I used to go to Pony Club 
 in North Molton but I don't any more. </content>
