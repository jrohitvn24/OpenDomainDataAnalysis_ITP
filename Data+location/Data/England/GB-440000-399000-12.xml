		<content> Wath has a very good bus service      
 running to the main towns in the      
 area.The car is still the main form of
 transport and because of the build up 
 in{motor vehicles}a new{by-pass}is    
 being built.This will cut down        
 congestion in the town centre and the 
 Montgomery roundabout.                
 The new road is being built to the    
 north of the town on the site         
 of an old disused canal.The cost will 
 be around Â£1.2m.The road is 1.2km long
 and 7.3 metres wide.Because it is     
 being built  on the old canal some of 
 the ground was boggy,so a layer of    
 rock had to be laid down to form a    
 firm foundation for the road.         
 Several old properties had to be      
 demolished,and an old bridge to make  
 way for the road.
