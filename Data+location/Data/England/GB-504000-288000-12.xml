		<content>   Cotterstock is a small linear       
 settlement one mile north of{Oundle}  
 surrounded by arable farm-land. It has
 a population of about 100. The school 
 has closed and the small number of    
 children in the village must go to    
 Oundle. It has an Early English       
 church, St.Andrew's, in which there is
 a fine brass. The houses are mainly   
 large and probably expensive, many of 
 them now owned by commuters who work  
 outside the village. The largest      
 building, Cotterstock Hall, is not    
 open to the public. New housing has   
 been created by conversion and        
 'in-fill' building.  Cotterstock Mill 
 is no longer working  and is owned by 
 an agricultural supplier. The village 
 which is designated a Conservation    
 Area, has no shops, post-office or    
 public house but the old school is    
 used as a village hall.               </content>
