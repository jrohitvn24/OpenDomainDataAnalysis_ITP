		<content> MARKFIELD PARADE                      
 There is a parade once a year with a  
 band at the front followed by         
 majorettes,floats and fancy dress     
 entrants. The parade is for Mecenfeld 
 School's garden fete.The school used  
 to give a prize for the best float but
 the Sunday School nearly always       
 won.The prize was a box of sweets     
 each.The Cubs and Scouts march with   
 them too.After the parade is the fete 
 with many stalls.                     
 FERRETING                             
 My hobby is looking after ferrets. I  
 take them ferreting down the back     
 fields. Most of my friends have them. 
 Some can be very vicious but I get    
 them young and handle them a lot and  
 they learn not to bite. I feed them on
 eggs, bread, milk and water. When I   
 get a rabbit or a pigeon I always give
 them the lights.                      </content>
