		<title>16MY FAVOURITE DAY</title>
		<content>   My favourite day is SATURDAY because
 the next day isn't school and I can go
 shopping. I like Saturdays because I  
 can play outside,go for walks,ride my 
 bike,play at my friend's house,watch  
 TV and have lots of sweets.Sometimes  
 I play cricket with my friends.I like 
 helping my Dad in the garden.I also   
 help my Mum do the washing up.

   My favourite day is TUESDAY because 
 we go Swimming.I like swimming,it is  
 good.There is a boy who helps us.His  
 name is Christopher Aldridge.He is a  
 good helper for his age, because he is
 14. I like picking up weights and     
 swimming a length.When we get back to 
 School,we have Break and then'Time &amp;  
 Tune.'We get our bags,say"Bye"to our  
 teacher and go home on the Army Bus.
