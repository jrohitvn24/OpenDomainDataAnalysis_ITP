		<content>  The alarm woke me at 8am and I had a 
cup of tea and a crumpet for breakfast.
I walked to the minibus which took me  
to school and then the school bell went
at 8:55am.                             
  The teacher took the register and we 
went into assembly.In assembly we sang 
two hymns,said a prayer and listened to
a story.We had a percentages and tables
test in maths,and then did some work on
fractions.After a 15 minute break,when 
I played football,we did some work on  
spellings.                             
  For school dinner we had baked beans,
chips and hamburger followed by custard
and chocolate cake.In the afternoon we 
had craft in which I was making a house
out of balsa wood.We studied a house in
Crank in History.When I got home I wat-
ched TV,played football and snooker    
before going to bed at 9:30pm.
