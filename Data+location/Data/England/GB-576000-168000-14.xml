 The year is 1985. Cars are now in     
 daily use. Cars are now a main part of
 our civilisation and cars are used    
 everyday. You cannot walk down a road 
 with out seeing a car of some sort.   
 They have been modernised through the 
 ages. Faster and more econimical cars 
 are on the market now. The fastest    
 cars are callled "Sports". The newest 
 Sports car is the Sierra which is     
 capable of speeds of 125 mph. Ford are
 leading manufacturers and have a top  
 range of cars especially roomy family 
 cars.
