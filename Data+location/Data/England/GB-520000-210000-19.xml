		<content> Looking from above our plot we would  
 see open{farmland, trees, houses,     
{River Lee, lakes, marshland}and the   
{A1(M)}which cuts the area in half.    
{To the west}level farmland is mainly  
 used for annual crops (wheat, barley  
 and potatoes).Farm{buildings}are of   
 concrete, brick and asbestos and blend
 well with the landscape.Machines can  
 be seen working the land and cattle   
 are in the fields at times.The largest
 and most common tree is the oak.      
{To the east}houses and shopping areas 
 are well set out, spacious, and new   
 and old blend well, with red tiles and
 brickwork. A number of lakes fed by   
 the river provide recreational and    
 ornamental facilities. Marshland in   
 the S.E.corner may soon be a further  
 leisure area.                         
{Wild life}includes Rabbits, Grey      
 Squirrels, Herons and many other birds</content>
