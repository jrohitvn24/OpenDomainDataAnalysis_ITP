		<content>   Since 1972 the Rector of Chinnor    
 -Church of St Andrew-has served the   
 united parish of Chinnor, with        
 Sydenham and Emmington.               
   St Mary's Church at Sydenham is 13th
 Century, quite large and still used   
 regularly.                            
   St Nicholas's Church at Emmington is
 12th Century and much smaller. Here   
 services are held monthly. This church
 has a Norman font.                    
   There is a strong tradition of      
 nonconformity; none of the three      
 villages has a Catholic Church. Indeed
 a recent history of Sydenham tells us 
 that no record of Roman Catholicism   
 has been found. This village has two  
 Baptist Chapels but neither exist now.
 One turned to Methodism at one time   
 but is now a private house.           
   Chinnor had a Baptist chapel once   
 but no longer.                        </content>
