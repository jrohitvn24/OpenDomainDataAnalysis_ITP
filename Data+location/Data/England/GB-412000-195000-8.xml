		<title>08FARMING AROUND KEMPSFORD</title>
		<content>   The farming is predominantly arable 
 although there are also dairy farms.  
 There are no sheep. Close to the three
 villages there tend to be meadows for 
 dairy cows where farms specialise in  
 milk production (with silage and hay  
 production) and also paddocks for     
 horses (kept for riding and hunting). 
   A survey of two square miles round  
{Castle Eaton}identified the fields as:
 9 wheat; 11 barley; 2 maize; 1 oilseed
 rape; 6 seed hay; 10 grass. The cereal
 fields are much larger (on average)   
 than the grass ones, as hedges have   
 been removed to create greater acreage
 units for the combine harvesters to   
 work efficiently. Around{Marston      
{Meysey}over 65% of fields and 75% of  
 the land produce cereals.
