		<content> The area is rural, very sparsely      
 populated.  The main hamlet of        
 Molesden has a population of under 40.
 The countryside is divided between    
 rough grazing for sheep and cattle,   
 and arable crops.  The land is gently 
 rolling and of considerable charm.    
 Most people are employed in farming,  
 although some incomers work in nearby 
 urban areas.  Most houses not directly
 connected with farming have large     
 gardens, paddock, etc., and horse     
 ownership is popular.  Just outside   
 Meldon the Morpeth Hunt has its       
 kennels.  There is a network of public
 footpaths, rights of way and          
 bridleways which offer very pleasant  
 walking, including on the disused     
 railway line and over fields and      
 riverside walks.
