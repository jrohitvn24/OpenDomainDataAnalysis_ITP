		<content>    My name is Jane Elizabeth Langley. 
 I live in Garsdon. I am the youngest  
 of three children. My Mum's name is   
 Jennifer Ann Langley and my Dad's name
 is Peter Leslie Langley. My sister,   
 Nicola is 15 years old and my brother 
 Christopher is 14. I am 11 years old. 
    My Father is a long distance lorry 
 driver. My Mother is a school dinner  
 lady at the Primary School at Lea, the
 same school I attend. Also at the     
 school there is another dinner lady   
 called Mrs Margaret Langley who is my 
 Mum's sister. She is married to Norman
 Langley who is my Dad's twin brother. 
 They have two sons that also attended 
 Lea School. My Aunt also cleans at the
 village hall in Charlton.
