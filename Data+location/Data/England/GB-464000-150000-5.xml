		<title>05Cetti's Warbler in Bas/stoke</title>
		<content> When I was doing the YOC sponsored    
{birdwatch}down at Blackdam{Nature     
{Centre}I saw a rare bird called a     
{Cetti's Warbler.                      
 This bird was nearly{extinct}but with 
 the help of the{Royal Society for the 
{Protection of Birds}it is coming back.
 That afternoon I telephoned the       
 Royal Society for the Protection of   
 Birds HQ at The Lodge. They sent a    
 member down to Blackdam to see if the 
 bird I saw had a mate and to see if it
 was breeding, as I saw the{Cetti's    
{Warbler}in May which is the{breeding  
{season}for most birds.                
 Unfortunately it was not breeding but 
 the RSPB will do a survey next year in
 the breeding season.                  
 Blackdam is a Nature Reserve. It is   
 maintained by{volunteers}and offers a 
 haven for wild birds and small        
 animals.It is next to the M3 Motorway.</content>
