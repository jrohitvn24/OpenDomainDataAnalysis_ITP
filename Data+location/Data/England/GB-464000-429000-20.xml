		<content> Its many years since Hemingbrough or  
 Cliffe had a village Bobby of their   
 own. The police presence with the     
 notable exception of the 1984 Miners' 
 strike is minimal. The character of   
 the area has long been peaceful and   
 law-abiding. The police service is    
 characterised by P.C. John Nichols of 
 Barlby (8 km distant)."Big John" as he
 is affectionately known serves as     
 Community Policeman and schools'      
 liaison officer often helping with    
 such matters as road safety and cycle 
 training.                             
 The area is expanding with further    
 development planned for the next      
 decade and residents fear that the    
 erstwhile tranquility of the area will
 become a thing of the past. To date   
 the assimilation of newcomers has gone
 well.It is hoped this will continue in
 years to come.                        </content>
