		<title>16Bugley Court Farm.</title>
		<content> Philip and Richard visited Mr and Mrs 
 Lewis who live in a modernised two    
 hundred year old farmhouse.There is a 
 copse which is left for wildlife, we  
 saw as grey squirrel and a partridge. 
 All around the farm was electric      
 fencing so we tried not to touch it.  
 They have 14 horses, 2 Jersey house   
 cows as well as calves and cattle they
 look after.They use some of the milk  
 themselves and the rest is for the    
 calves and the two farm cats.Pauline  
 has worked for Mr Lewis for many years
 and trains the horses for eventing and
 dressage.This year one of their horses
 won second at the Bath and West Show. 
 Their chickens used to be free range  
 but now they have a fenced in place   
 because a fox had some.
