		<title>02LANDSCAPE. A QUICK LOOK.</title>
		<content> This is a largely {rural} area with   
 much of the land used  for agriculture
 or covered with woodland and commons. 
                                       
 The densest area of{housing}is at the 
 village of{Knowl Hill} where there is 
 a selection of different dwellings,   
 some being Council property and others
 privately owned.                      
                                       
 The busy {A4,}London to Bristol, road 
 cuts through this D Block .           
 So does the main London to Bristol    
{Railway Line,}following Brunel's      
 original route. {                     
                                       
 Scattered throughout the area are some
{historically interesting properties}  
 in large gardens or grounds.          
                                       
{Quarries,}producing clay for the tile 
 works, are still in use in Knowl Hill.</content>
