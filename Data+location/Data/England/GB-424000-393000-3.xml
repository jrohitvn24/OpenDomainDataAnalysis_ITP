 the reservoir are planted with copper 
 beech,alder,willow and horse_chestnut 
 trees.Lots of young frog hoppers were 
 found.On the 17th May 1985 a group    
 spent 2 sessions bird watching near   
 the reservoir.The water was checked   
 for wildfowl and close observation was
 made of the sandbanks,marshy areas and
 reed beds.A tufted duck was seen      
 diving for food and several male      
 mallards.A female mallard was also    
 spotted leading seven ducklings down  
 the edge of the reservoir.Willow      
 warblers were seen and heard in the   
 waterside willows.Other species       
 observed were moorhen,common          
 sandpiper,pied wagtail and swallow.The
 reservoir is not used for fishing or  
 sailing.
