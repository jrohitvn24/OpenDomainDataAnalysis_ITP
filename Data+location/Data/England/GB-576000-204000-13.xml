		<title>13THE DANBURY PARKS</title>
		<content> The National Trust owns both Danbury  
 and Lingwood Commons,and also the     
 Lakes.A rather large camp was         
 confirmed on the East side of Danbury 
 Common.Danbury and Lingwood Common and
 the High Common are the remnants of a 
 forest that covered the Ridge in the  
 Saxon times.Danbury Common used to be 
 an army camp during the French        
 Revolution.Danbury's landscape is     
 composed of shades of many hues.To be 
 found here are the lakes.There is one 
 lake the size of a pond, one that is  
 very big and one that is              
 interesting.In the summer the         
 rhodedendrons bloom,in autumn the     
 different fruits tumble down from the 
 trees,in the winter the lakes and     
 parks freeze and the countryside looks
 like a crystal forest and when spring 
 comes the leafy shoots burst out      
 starting summer when the cycle begins.</content>
