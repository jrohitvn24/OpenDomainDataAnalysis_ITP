		<title>11  A FIREMAN'S AFTERNOON</title>
		<content>   The day shift had their dinner at   
 l.00 p.m.  For lunch they had meat    
 pie, potatoes, beans and carrots.  For
 sweet they had rice pudding.  Later   
 they played badminton in the appliance
 room.                                 
   At 2.00 p.m. my Dad took his men on 
 a fire safety check at Edgecombe      
 Nursing Home.  At 3.02 they were      
 called to a kitchen fire at Thatcham. 
 While the crew put out the fire my Dad
 (who is a sub-officer) wrote out some 
 fire report notes.                    
   On returning to the station they had
 a cup of tea.  After this the men     
 serviced and cleaned their equipment  
 while my Dad wrote out the fire report
 and organised the next day's work.    
   He finished work at 6.00 p.m. and   
 was home by 6.l5 p.m.                 
                                       
                                       </content>
