		<title>17DRAYCOTE WATERS</title>
		<content>The Draycote scheme cost 3 million     
pounds! Work began in 1967. Draycote   
water lies in a basin bounded by the   
Mensborough hills to the south and the 
high ground near the village of        
Thurlaston and the M45 to the north.   
There is nearly a square mile of water,
five miles of banks and the reservoir  
holds 5000 million gallons, with a     
maximum depth of 68ft.                 
Water enters the reservoir from        
Eathorpe pumping station through two   
upturned bell mouths into a stilling   
basin and down a cascade to provide    
aeration and prevent scour. There is an
overflow weir with breakwaters to      
prevent loss of water.                 
It is extensively used for recreation  
and in particular for trout fishing and
sailing.
