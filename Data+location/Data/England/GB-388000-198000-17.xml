		<title>17FIRST GATCOMBE HORSE TRIALS</title>
		<content> It was August 7th and like most       
 important days it was drizzling.  At  
 10.15 a.m. the two car parks were     
 already nearly full.  The tents were  
 full of customers, and the sun soon   
 came out.  Of course the Show Jumping 
 was the big attraction and was soon   
 drawing a large crowd.  After lunch   
 the Cross Country started.  It is a   
 good setting for the event because the
 hills make it possible to see a lot of
 the jumps. A favourite jump is Fence  
 3, which is a wall with a drop and a  
 bank with a five-bar gate as fence 4. 
 A lot of horses refuse here.  Another 
 popular string of jumps are 7-16,     
 which can all be seen from one        
 position.  The Dressage is performed  
 behind Gatcombe House, the home of    
 Princess Anne and Capt. Mark Phillips.
 1983's winner was Lucindas Green.
