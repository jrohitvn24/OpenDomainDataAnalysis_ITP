		<content>   They were very strict when I was at 
 school and we did noit have as many   
 holidays as you have. My parents were 
 also very strict and we could not do  
 just as we liked. My parents were     
 good. We never went hungry and we went
 on a holiday every year so we were    
 luckier than some were because my     
 father worked for the government. When
 I was young I was not allowed to go   
 swimming or dancing because I had     
 heart trouble. I missed that. When I  
 left school I became a dressmaker and 
 had a three year apprenticeship. I    
 enjoyed my life. People were very poor
 when I was young but they appeared to 
 be satisfied and contented. Food was  
 very cheap in those days. I think the 
 world is going mad now. Even so I don 
 not think there will ever be a nuclear
 war.I have lived through 2 world wars.
 The second was the worst with V bombs.</content>
