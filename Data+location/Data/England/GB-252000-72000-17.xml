		<title>17Sampford Spiney Church</title>
		<content> There is one church in this area at   
 Sampford Spiney - St Mary's, which    
 dates from 1250 AD. It formerly       
 belonged to Plympton Priory, the arms 
 of which religious house may be seen  
 on the south face of the tower. They  
 are carved on a stone at the side of a
 large window, two keys crossed. The   
 pinnacles which rise from the angles  
 of the tower are perpendicular. This  
 parish of about 120 people is now     
 joined ecclesiastically with the      
 neighbouring parish of Horrabridge    
 which means that fewer services are   
 held in the church tshan a few years  
 ago.
