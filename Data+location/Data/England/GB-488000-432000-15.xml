		<title>15A MONDAY IN NORTH CAVE</title>
		<content>     "Time to get up" Mum called.  I   
 woke with a start and realized she was
 right.  I staggered, half asleep into 
 the bathroom to get a wash.  Then I   
 pulled on my clothes and slowly went  
 downstairs to breakfast.  I was first 
 down and helped to set the table.  Dad
 came and started his cornflakes.  A   
 half-dressed Bev. sat next to me "Good
 morning," I said and all I got was a  
 grumpy glare.  Dad went to work after 
 breakfast.  "See you," I called and   
 heard the car start up noisily.  I    
 didn't enjoy school much that day as I
 was late and had no P.E. kit.  When I 
 got home, I did my homework and played
 tennis with Bev.  Mum needed the table
 setting and asked me to whip an angel 
 delight mix, my favourite job.  After 
 tea - cornish pasties - we played     
 cricket and,exhausted,we went to bed.
