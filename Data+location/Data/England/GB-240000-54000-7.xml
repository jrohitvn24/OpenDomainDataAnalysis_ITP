		<title>07   The Torpoint Ferry cont.1</title>
		<content>  -The ferries were at the mercy of the
 winds and tides.                      
    In 1829 the first steam powered    
 ferry was built but it was not        
 successful because it did not run on  
 chains.It only lasted for 6 months and
 the ferry had to go back to the horse 
 and foot boat.In 1832, 2 ferries which
 were steam driven and run on chains   
 were designed.These ferries lasted    
 until 1871 and 1878 respectively.     
    Until 1895 the chain ferry stopped 
 running at 9 p.m but people wanted a  
 later service . Mr. Reynolds of the   
 Torpoint tug company used three of his
 tug to provide a crossing service     
 until 12.30 a.m.But in 1900 the ferry 
 owner raised the tugs landing charges 
 so much thet Mr. Reynolds stopped     
 running his tugs. People of Torpoint  
 were so angry thet the ferry owners   
 had to arrange their own steamer _    </content>
