		<content> Caerhays Castle is a beautiful        
 building of grey towers and turrets   
 set in 60 acres of woods and park     
 overlooking Porthluney Beach.There was
 a manor house here before the Norman  
 invasion,but this castle was built in 
 1808.It was designed by John Nash,the 
 architect of Buckingham Palace.It was 
 built for the Trevanions but expense  
 was so great they lost all their money
 and had to leave.The castle remained  
 empty for years,the roof collapsed and
 caused much damage.It was bought by   
 the Williams family in 1852 and is now
 occupied by Mr.Julian Williams.He is a
 council member who administers the    
 Duchy of Cornwall for Prince Charles. 
 The castle is not open to the public  
 in June 1985 thirty children from     
 Gorran School were invited there to   
 look around and meet the owners.
