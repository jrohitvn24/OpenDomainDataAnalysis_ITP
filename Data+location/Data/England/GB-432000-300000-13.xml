 Employment within the area is         
 predominantly farming. There are some 
 self employed residents in the        
 villages and the mill at Sheepy Parva 
 employs several people but these are  
 not all from the area. The mill which 
 now deals in animal foods dates back  
 to the 11th centuary and was mentioned
 along with Sheepy in the 1086 Domesday
 Book. However the majority of the     
 working population commute to jobs    
 outside the area and so car ownership 
 is a priority. The lack of public     
 transport is a problem especially for 
 the youngsters seeking work or further
 education.
