		<title>06VISIT TO I.C.I.</title>
		<content> We went to visit ICI.When we got      
 there we met the the site manager Mr  
 Robinson.He took us round.First he    
 talked about Winston Churchill who    
 in 1912 came to the Stanleys          
 wedding.Then we went to the lake.When 
 ICI first came the lake was divided   
 into two sections. ICI turned it into 
 one lake. In the lake there were      
 Canada geese. Coots and Martins. For  
 the people who volunteer themselves to
 try the drugs they built an office and
 games room. Since they try the drugs  
 they have to stay there for up to a   
 week. They built the office over the  
 water. They made a dam drained the    
 water and laid concrete posts and put 
 the office on top. We then came out   
 and went into another entrance. We    
 went to the sports club. They have    
 lots of sports facilites like Tennis  
 Squash. Football and lots more.       </content>
