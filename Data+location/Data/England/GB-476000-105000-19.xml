		<content>   There is a great variety of         
 Religious belief in both the          
 Southbourne area and in Britain today.
 Types of Christianity abound - the    
 area has several churches,but regular 
 church attendance has declined.People 
 are no longer afraid to question      
 religion.An increasing number of      
 parents do not have their children    
 baptised,preferring to leave religion 
 to school and the child's own         
 inclination.                          
   There has been an increase in       
 knowledge of other faiths,largely     
 brought about by the growth of multi- 
 racial communities in our cities.     
 Strangely,our area has very few       
 immigrants or coloured peoples.       
   Alongside scepticism threr is a     
 growing interest in related fields    
 such as the paranormal and life after 
 death.                                </content>
