		<content>{                                      
  There are a lot of new estates around
 Haxby.There used to be a large old    
 house called Eastfield House but it   
 was pulled down and now a lot of new  
 houses are being built in its place.  
  I live in a detached house, it is    
 about 7 years old. It has 3 bedrooms, 
 1 bathroom, 1 living room, 1 kitchen  
 and a dining room.Since we moved in   
 all the rooms have been redecorated.  
 We used to have a long dining and     
 living room together but now we have  
 an extension to our garage and we have
 a breakfast bar.                      
  We have lived in our house about 5   
 years before that we lived in a block 
 of town houses.
