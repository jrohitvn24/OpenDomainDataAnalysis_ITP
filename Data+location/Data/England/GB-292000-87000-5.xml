		<content> We went to Pottles Farm and           
 interviewed the farmer's daughter. We 
 found out that they have got 450 acres
 of land most of which is grass. They  
 grow corn, maize, lucerne and peas.   
 These crops are rotated every eight   
 years. They use natural and artifical 
 fertilizers. Beef cattle and sheep are
 kept. The corn is sold to a corn      
 merchant in Exeter and the cattle and 
 sheep are sent to market. The wool is 
 sent to Buckfastliegh and some apples 
 are sold for cider. The farm has four 
 tractors and a lot machinery. A       
 combine harvester is shared with a    
 neighbour.                            
                                       
 The family starts work at 7.30am and  
 sometimes work until 9.00pm. In the   
 past the farm was smaller with less   
 machinery and more workers.
