		<title>01GENERAL REVIEW.</title>
		<content> This rural area is mainly farmland and
 very flat.Many of the houses are old  
 and made of stone with slate roofs.   
 There are some very picturesque       
 thatched cottages. A few main roads   
 run through but most are narrow       
 country lanes. Dairy farming is       
 predominant and therefore the fields  
 are used mainly for hay or silage     
 making and for grazing. Some crops are
 grown such as barley and wheat.       
 The people live in four communities.  
 The smallest is Adber consisting of   
 farms and cottages. Ashington has a   
 fine manor house and interesting      
 church. Chilton Cantelo is noted for  
 its private school and mysterious     
 skull and headless body. Marston Magna
 is the biggest and can boast of a     
 village post office, two public houses
 manor  house, church, winery, and the 
 unusual moat field.                   </content>
