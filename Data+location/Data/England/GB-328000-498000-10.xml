		<title>10Local History in Yewdale 1</title>
		<content>    The history of the area is very    
 much bound up with the extraction of  
 minerals since early times. Copper had
 been taken from the{Coppermines Valley
 since the mid-16th Century, with more 
 extensive workings right through until
 the end of the 19th Century. This     
 industry led to a growth in population
 in the Coniston district, and an      
 influx of Cornish miners with their   
 traditional surnames that are still   
 found today, e.g. Livesey.            
    The extensive coppice woodlands in 
 the area are a reminder of the past   
 importance of{charcoal}burning in     
 association with rich{iron ore}brought
 in from the Dalton area. The monks of 
{Furness Abbey}developed primitive     
 smelting hearths, or 'bloomeries', in 
 the Coniston valley, sited on the lake
 shore to take advantage of the easiest
 form of bulk transport.               </content>
