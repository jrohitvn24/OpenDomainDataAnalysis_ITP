		<title>04WALTHAM ABBEY LIBRARY</title>
		<content> On the 2nd July,1985 a group from     
 class 4R, went to interview the Chief 
 Librarian at Waltham Abbey.           
 The library was built in 1956, and    
 holds approximately{17,000 books.     
 The majority of people who use the    
 library are older people, and         
 youngsters (between six and eight     
 years old). The quietest day          
 of the week is Wednesday. And the     
 busiest period in the year is between 
 October and December. The most popular
 books are romantic novels for older   
 women. In the past few years tickets  
 have been put onto a{computerised     
 system. About six and a half thousand 
 people belong to the library. In the  
 last five years people use the library
 less often. But when the{new library  
 is opened in{1986,}it is hoped that   
 more people will make use of the      
 library.                              </content>
