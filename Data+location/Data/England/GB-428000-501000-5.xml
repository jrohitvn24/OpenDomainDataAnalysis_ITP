		<title>05Farming in the Cowtons</title>
		<content> Mixed farming is carried out in the   
 Cowtons area. One large farm is arable
 only, but the majority have livestock 
 also. As well as winter wheat and     
 barley, oil-seed rape is now a very   
 profitable crop. Beef cattle are now  
 commonplace. Young bulls are fed      
 indoors until they are 12 months old  
 and sold for beef. Only a few farms   
 are dairy farms. They have herds of   
 approx. 80 cows, all milk goes by bulk
 tanker to the milk marketing board.   
 The majority either suckle calves with
 cows (2-3 per cow), or calves are fed 
 milk substitutes. Most go for         
 slaughter at 18 months to 2 years old.
 Market gardening is carried out at    
 Pepper Arden Farms. Customers may go  
 to pick their own fruit (eg: straw-   
 berries). There is a Ross Poultry     
 broiler breeder farm with 8000 birds  
 in North Cowton.                      </content>
