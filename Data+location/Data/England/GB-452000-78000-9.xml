		<title>09Wroxall's new school.</title>
		<content>  We are going to have{a new school}in 
 Wroxall because the old one is too    
 small,cold and damp and the staples   
 in books go rusty.It is 112 years     
 old.                                  
 The parents and governers wrote to the
 Prime Minister and organised a        
 petition with 720 signatures.Our mums 
 went to County Hall with banners to   
 hand it in.                           
  On the 24 of May at 11:00 we went to 
 St.Martins Road to the field where the
 new school will be.We put some flags  
 up and the people came to the field.We
 sat on a  bank and some of us removed 
 the first turfs.Then we cheered and we
 all had a drink and a biscuit.        
  Today we went to look at the work.   
 There are three JCBs and 7 men and    
 lots of bricks and 1 lorry and lots   
 of dirt.
