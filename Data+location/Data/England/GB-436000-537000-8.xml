		<title>08Wingate - New Housing</title>
		<content>    When the colliery was first opened 
 in Wingate, the{coal owners built     
{houses for the mineworkers.           
    The{first}of these streets in      
 Wingate was{called Sinkers Row,}long  
 since demolished, these were{occupied 
{by the men who dug out the mine shaft.
 Many more streets were built when the 
 mine was fully operational.           
  Since the closing of the mine most of
 these streets have disappeared and the
 land reclaimed. Oddly the same land   
 has tended not to be used for the     
 building of new houses. Instead       
 urbanisation has begun to encroach on 
 the woodland on the edge of the       
 village. Possibly the idea of people  
 living 'in the country' appealed to   
 the local planning department. This is
 particularly unusual as in Station    
 Town, a sister village, the reverse   
 has been the case.                    </content>
