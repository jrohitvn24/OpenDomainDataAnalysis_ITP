		<title>19Summary of Village Life</title>
		<content> A person reading this survey of our   
 area may well think that there is very
 little to commend it.  Certainly, we  
 do not have many amenties as compared 
 with a town area.                     
                                       
 However by talking to the inhabitants 
 of the area it is realised that the   
 quality of life is still very high.   
 There exists amongst people in        
 villages a sort of friendliness which 
 is not always apparent amongst twon   
 people.                               
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
