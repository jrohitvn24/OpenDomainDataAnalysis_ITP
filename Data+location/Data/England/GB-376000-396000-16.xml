		<title>16Hope Hospital (785 989)</title>
		<content> Hope Hospital, on Eccles Old Road, is 
 called after the district in which it 
 is built. It is the largest hospital  
 in the area. It started as a workhouse
 in 1882, specially built to cope with 
 the destitute, sick and infirm.       
 During the First World War it took    
 wounded soldiers and in 1925 became a 
 General Hospital. It was damaged by   
 bombing during the Second World War   
 but afterwards was expanded greatly.  
 Hope is now a teaching hospital and it
 has 647 beds and treats over 17000    
 in-patients a year.                   
 You can still see traces of the old   
 workhouse and there are still long    
 brick corridors with high roofs. Like 
 every other hospital, Hope has its    
 problems, mainly through shortage of  
 funds. Patients are even sometimes    
 asked to take blankets in with them   
 and the sheets are thin and mended.   </content>
