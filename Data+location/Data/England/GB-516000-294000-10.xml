		<title>10Orton Longueville changes.</title>
		<content>   Orton Longueville has changed       
 greatly over the last 100 years.      
 Almost all the houses were in The     
 Village, Botolph lane and along Oundle
 road.  The Royston Avenue/Oakleigh    
 Drive housing estate dates from the   
 1960's.  Botolph lane and Mogswell    
 Lane are the only 2 roads which are   
 still made up of hardcore with no tar 
 on them.  All the village roads would 
 have been like this.  In the big house
 on Oundle road 30 years ago the       
 children from the village school used 
 to have a fete in the garden and      
 country dance.   If they pleased the  
 owner she would throw sweets down to  
 them from an upstairs window.  At that
 time the houses on Botolph lane were  
 mainly thatched, but now all have     
 tiled roofs, the only thatch being    
 along The Village.  The school has    
 moved from The village to Oundle Rd.  </content>
