		<content> Air Day is put on at Culdrose every   
 year, usually in July.There are air   
 displays like the "Sharks"helicopter  
 display team which uses Gazelle       
 helicopters to do all sorts of        
 aerobatics.There is usually a Search  
 and Rescue display to show how people 
 are rescued from cliffs and ships by  
 winches.Visitors to Air Day can get   
 winched up in a hangar.               
 Sometimes old aircraft are flown and  
 modern aeroplanes are on show.        
 Sometimes there is a fair and a       
 selection of  stalls by the hanger.   
  Near the runway there are sweet      
 stalls,toy stalls and food stalls.    
     The main attraction is the Red    
 Arrows who do aerobatics and formation
 flying over the airfield.             
 Air Day is a very popular occasion and
 it is always packed out with visitors.
