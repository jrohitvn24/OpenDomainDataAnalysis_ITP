		<title>16Life in Burton</title>
		<content> We asked the population of our        
 village how long they had lived here. 
 One family had been in Burton for only
 3 months but 21 families have lived   
 here for over 50 years,one family for 
 60 years and the longest anyone had   
 lived in Burton was 77 years.Some     
 people were asked why they liked      
 living in Burton.A large  majority of 
 the people remarked that Burton was   
 quiet and peaceful.Other reasons were 
 its friendliness,its atmosphere and   
 the rural surroundings.There were 2 or
 3 people who said they found it       
 unfriendly.Some people found the      
 heavy traffic that came through Burton
 a disadvantage and many people said   
 that the bus service was infrequent   
 and expensive.One or two people said  
 that they did not like the low flying 
 aircraft that come over,and some      
 remarked there weren't enough shops.  </content>
