		<title>04THE CHURCH - BUILDINGS</title>
		<content>    West Pennard parish church is      
 typical of many Somerset churches,    
 being medieval and having a tower.    
 The church is of the late medieval    
 period but it was not all built at the
 same time.The arches on the north side
 of the aisle are uniform and those on 
 the south are irregular.The church was
 originally part of the manor of West  
 Pennard and owned by the Abbot of     
 Glastonbury. In the early 19th century
 it became an independent benefice but 
 has just returned to the guardianship 
 of St.John Baptist (Glastonbury) as   
 part of the Abbey Five with one vicar 
 covering five parishes.               
    The tower holds 6 bells dating from
 1604 to 1879. The south wall of the   
 tower has a smooth facing which was   
 added in the 19th century for playing 
 fives. The west wall has a clock that 
 must be wound once a week.            </content>
