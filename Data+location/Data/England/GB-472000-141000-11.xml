		<title>11HISTORY (FROYLE/HOLYBOURNE)</title>
		<content> Our area has had people living in it  
 for over 50,000 years (a Mousterian   
 axe was found near Yarnhams Farm, also
{burnt flints}and a {round barrow.})   
 The remains of the  road from         
 Silchester to Chichester can be seen  
 and the Roman road from Winchester to 
 London must have cut across the area. 
 In the Bronze Age  a{bronze brooch}was
 lost near the Roman road site and     
 found a few years ago.  Remains of a  
 Roman building were found near        
 Yarnhams Farm and a Saxon drain was   
 discovered near Rye Bridge.           
{Saintbury Hill} was probably {        
{'Freya's' Hill}in pagan times.  Freya 
 was the goddess of corn and Froyle was
 probably named after her.             
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
