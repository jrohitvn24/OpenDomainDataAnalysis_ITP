		<content> the Adur is a winter sanctuary        
 require a saltmarsh to provide them   
 with protection and food found on the 
 exposed mudflats. Simply moving to    
 another estuary is not possible.      
 Estuaries are scarce and already carry
 as many birds as they can provide for.
 Many seagulls also use the area to    
 roost at night away from predators.   
    In 1982 Adur District Council sent 
 out a report about a "Conservation    
 Policy for the Widewater." The idea   
 was to help the unemployed involving  
 them in community services and other  
 events. The work would include the    
 removal of litter,the clearing of     
 derelict areas and the culverting of  
 the causeway to prevent stagnation.   
 These were some of the ideas to       
 improve the future of Widewater.
