		<title>06HOLLINGWORTH TRAFFIC COUNT</title>
		<content> The main road in Hollingworth is      
 called Market Street . Market Street  
 is very busy because lorries, vans and
 cars use it because it is part of the 
 A 628 Trunk Road from Manchester to   
 Sheffield.                            
 On Wednesday, 15 May 1985 Class 2F of 
 St Andrew's School, Hadfield went to  
 count traffic along Market Street for 
 half an hour. The results were:       
         2 bicycles                    
         6 motorcycles                 
        55 vans                        
        46 lorries                     
        43 articulated lorries         
         4 single decker buses         
         5 double decker buses         
         2 tractors                    
       345 cars                        
 This was a mid morning count and shows
 how heavy the traffic is. When people 
 go to and return from work it's worse.</content>
