 living for 4 {charcoal burners }who   
 work throughout the year,producing    
 charcoal almost exclusively for {     
{barbeque fuel.}These men clear areas  
 of the forest under the direction of  
 the owner during the winter months.   
 Wood which can be used for fencing    
 etc. is taken to the sawmill and the  
 rest is stacked for making charcoal.  
 There are 6 {locally made metal kilns 
 in operation. They were designed by   
 the father of the present charcoal    
 burner. The kiln is tightly packed,   
 fired and burned for 36 hrs.Contents  
 are reduced by 33% {Charcoal is       
{graded}by sieving before packing in   
 sacks for marketing.
