		<title>06THE NEW BIELD AT LYVEDEN 2</title>
		<content>  In 1605 Sir Thomas died. His son     
 Francis was involved in the           
 Gunpowder Plot and died in the Tower  
 of London. The Rushton (Rushden?)     
 estate was fortified to the crown,but 
 Lyveden passed on to the younger son  
 SirLewis.For a time Lyveden belonged  
 to the junior branch of the Treshams  
 of Newton.                            
  The property passed into the hands   
 of the Fitzpatrick family early in the
 eighteenth century. In 1922, the New  
 Bield was presented to the National   
 Trust, who repaired it and made it    
 accessible to the public. To reach the
 Bield you have to park your car at the
 foot of the hill on the Benefield to  
 Brigstock road and then walk up to the
 property. Tickets are bought from the 
 cottage of the custodians who will    
 also sell you a National Trust        
 booklet.                              </content>
