		<title>14Four Oaks- Transport</title>
		<content> The district is well served with      
 public transport,although the bus     
 service has been subjected to cuts    
 because of financial consideration    
 following the governments decision    
 that public transport should be more  
 financially viable.There is a good    
 local rail service to Birmingham which
 carries heavy commuter traffic at the 
 peak periods in the mornings and early
 evenings.There is a scheme to provide 
 an integrated Birmingham Light Rail   
 Service, running partly underground,  
 which might include this area.This    
 plan is due for completion in 1990 and
 would be of great benefit.The main    
 form of transport for most people is  
 the motor car,either private or       
 company owned.Parking facilities are  
 a problem in the more commercial areas
 but some off-street parking has       
 helped.The Motorway System is nearby. </content>
