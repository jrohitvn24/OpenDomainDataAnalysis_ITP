		<content> It took 16 years to decide if         
{Stockwood}should have a library or    
 not. It was opened on Weds 28th.      
 Oct.1981. It has 25000 books for you  
 to choose from. There are two         
 sections, adults and childrens. There 
 is a pre-school story time every      
 Friday at 14.30 hours.                
 In an average day 100-150 people visit
 the library.                          
 They have a choice of magazines, books
 or tapes. The period of loan for      
 adults is 3 weeks. There is a library 
 photographer and at present he is     
 doing an exhibition about Stockwood.  
 The local readers contribute a small  
 exhibition each week. Quite a lot of  
 people go to the library to study or  
 read daily newspapers.
