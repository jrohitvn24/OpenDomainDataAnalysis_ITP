		<title>11The Village of Norton</title>
		<content> Norton was in the first Domesday Book.
It was called Norton in the Moors.     
Before the Norman Conquest the land    
was held by 2 freemen named Ulviet and 
Godric.In 1086 there was enough farm-  
land for 4 ploughs.There were   9      
families, each held a smallholding     
and had 3 ploughs between them.There   
was a large area of woodland.          
 William the Conqueror gave the land to
Robert de Stafford.                    
 Norton is very different now. There   
is some farmland but no woodland. It is
a large village and alot of people live
there.Everybody has a piece of land    
which they can do what they want with. 
There are not many shops but you can   
buy what food you want and get a small 
toy from the paper shop.In the park    
you can play tennis and have a picnic. 
I wonder what William would think.
