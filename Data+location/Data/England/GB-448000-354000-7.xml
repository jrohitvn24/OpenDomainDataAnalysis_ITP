 We went to see New Farm, which is on  
 all the maps that we have.  We found  
 that houses and bungalows had been    
 built on that land in 1981.  There are
 between twenty and thirty houses on   
 the site which is known now as The    
 Paddock.                              
   {Bentinck Colliery }own 80 acres    
 for farming.7.5 acres are used for    
 barley.   In 1978 the restoration of  
 the pit tips won a national award from
 the Business and Industry Awards      
 scheme.   The first 16 acres of       
 restored land on this tip were handed 
 over in 1971, more land being added to
 this as work progressed.   At the     
 present time Mr Lee is farming 70     
 acres of restored land.
