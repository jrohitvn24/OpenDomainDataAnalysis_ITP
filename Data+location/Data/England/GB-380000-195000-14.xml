		<title>14ATTITUDES TO KINGSCOTE</title>
		<content> Residents enjoy the quietness, peace  
 and tranquillity(59%) of a rural      
{lifestyle}(21%) in beautiful          
 countryside (41%). Specific details of
 the advantage of living here include  
 friendly people and community, the    
 slow pace of life, the healthy air,   
 solitude, space and the lack of       
 "hooligans", in this small, unspoilt  
 and yet accessible village.  The main 
 drawback of living here (apart from   
 the lack of shops) is the cold windy  
 winter with hazardous driving         
 conditions and roads sometimes blocked
 with snow.                            
 Developments of new expensive property
 have altered the balance between      
 farming village and up-market         
 dormitory.  This has brought more     
 young children and breathed new life  
 into the community this is welcomed by
 most but resented by a few.           </content>
