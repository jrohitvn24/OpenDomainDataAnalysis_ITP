		<content> The Pearces' have farmed 200 acres on 
 the Werrington Estate over 20 years.It
 is bounded by{coniferous plantation   
 there are{fox,badgers,weasels,rabbits,
{moles and deer.}Fox are welcome as    
 they move on if breeding leads to over
 crowding,badgers stay even if short of
 food,this is when they catch disease  
 like{Tuberculosis.}Mrs.Pearce believes
 that TB is not caused by badgers as   
 the authorities do,none of their cows 
 has ever had the disease. South of    
 Petherwin Gate is{Hellescott Vineyard,
 growing white wine grapes,wine is made
 and bottled on site.Vines grow in     
 opaque plastic houses,winds are a     
 problem.Farms have 1 or more{working  
{dogs}for herding cattle and sheep.Few 
 children keep pets, mainly girls have 
{ponies.Pet dogs}are required to be    
 licensed.Many{semi wild cats}abound   
 keeping{rats and mice}at bay.         </content>
