		<content> Scott Road leads into Ward Crescent   
 and there are 24 houses. They are all 
 semi-detached and built of cement     
 slabs in 1950. They are all council   
 houses and belong to the Havers       
 Estate. None of the houses have       
 garages but they have all got gardens 
 in the front. In the gardens were lots
 of flowers like poppies, roses, pinks 
 and pansies.We saw 7 cars parked on   
 the road and another 7 cars parked on 
 the special space provided. In between
 Scott Road and Ward Crescent is a     
 large grassy area where the children  
 play. Two Eastern National buses serve
 the area and they turn round at Ward  
 Crescent. They are Routes Nos. 300 and
 309 and they run every hour from      
 Thorley Park to the town.
