		<title>13    A SCHOOL DAY</title>
		<content> The alarm rings at 7.30 and I get out 
 of bed and get dressed after which I  
 eat my breakfast.At about 8.30 I leave
 for school and arrive about 10 minutes
 later when the bell rings everyone    
 goes through one of the 3 main doors  
 to enter the school.After this we all 
 register and lead off for our first   
 lesson in my case chemistry.This      
 lesson is the same as usual,that is   
 very little work.After this comes     
 break which passes without            
 incident.When the bell rings we walk  
 to physics.This lesson is quite hard  
 but is alright. At lunch I get an     
 ice-cream. In the afternoon I go to   
 registration followed by French, not  
 one of my favourite lessons.Next comes
 geography. On any day there are 8     
 lessons, a break of 15 minutes and an 
 hour lunch break.                     
                                       </content>
