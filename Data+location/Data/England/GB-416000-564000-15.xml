		<content>   Although there are Churches of      
 England in Newburn and Throckley,it is
 the Methodist influence which is the  
 predominant persuasion in this area.In
 the past there have been both         
 Methodist and Primitive Methodist     
 Chapels in Lemington,Throckley,       
 Walbottle and Newburn.Today we only   
 find Methodist Chapels in Lemington,  
 Walbottle and Throckley.With the      
 closing of the Primitive Methodist    
 Chapel in Walbottle and an expanding  
 population,due to the increase of     
 industry in the area,the original     
 Chapel,built in 1837 was closed,and a 
 new one built.                        
   In the past Catholics had to go to  
 Bells Close for services.In 1935 a    
 Catholic School was built,and later a 
 Church in Throckley in 1975.          
   Jehovah's Witnesses have recently   
 moved into the old Coop buildings.    </content>
