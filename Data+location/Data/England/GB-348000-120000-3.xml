		<title>03FARMING</title>
		<content> On one of our plots we had three local
 farms,'Broadmead','Woodrows' and      
 'Poplars'.                            
  We talked to the owners of the farms.
 Broadmead is a dairy farm owned by    
 couple who moved there in 1964.They   
 have opened a few of their fields for 
 crops.Woodrows farm is a dairy farm.  
 They have been there since 1961. They 
 have opened most of their fields.     
 Their land is rough grazing  and five 
 crop fields.The owners of Poplars farm
 have been farming for 15 years.They   
 have an orchard,rough grazing fields  
 and free range hens.They also grow    
 seed crops.                           
  Each farmers told us that farming has
 become easier now that the farming    
 equipment is more advanced.           
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
