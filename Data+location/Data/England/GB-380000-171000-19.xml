		<title>19The Colerne Donkey</title>
		<content> Colerne has a legend known as The     
 Colerne Donkey. It is supposed to be  
 buried in Colerne church yard. The    
 legend is about a parson and his pet  
 donkey. The parson went on holiday and
 left the donkey with the sexton. While
 the parson was away the donkey fell   
 ill and died. The sexton ordered the  
 donkey to be buried. Unfortunatly the 
 grave was not big enough and the      
 hooves of the donkey stuck up through 
 the ground. So the sexton told the    
 villagers to polish the hooves of the 
 donkey until they shone. When the     
 parson returned the sexton told him   
 what had happened to the donkey. The  
 parson told the villagers to dig a    
 wider grave so the donkey could lie on
 its side. The grave of the donkey is  
 still in the church yard now, though  
 it is an unmarked grave.
