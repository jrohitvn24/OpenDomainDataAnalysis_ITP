		<content>   St.Regis Packaging is situated on   
 the Ely-Prickwillow road.It makes card
 board packaging for a variety of      
 industrial and commercial uses.It is  
 owned by an American company and      
 employs 200 people.Only 30 of these   
 are women,as are the nine office and  
 factory cleaners.50% of the paper with
 which the cardboard boxes are made    
 comes by ship from the parent company 
 in America,20% from Scandinavia and   
 the remaining 30% from Britain.The    
 various grades of paper are processed 
 using a corrugator machine which      
 produces cardboard in sheet board     
 form.The cardboard is then fed into a 
 machine called an Armstitcher which   
 staples it to the required shape and  
 size.The main customers are Rothmans  
 and Procter &amp; Gamble but altogether   
 the factory provides packaging for    
 1,300 firms.                          </content>
