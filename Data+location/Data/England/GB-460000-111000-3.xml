		<title>03LOCAL GOVERNMENT IN NEWTOWN</title>
		<content> Soberton and Newtown Parish Council   
 meet once a month, alternating        
 between Soberton Village Hall and     
 Rookesbury Hall. It has 11 elected    
 coucillors and has its first lady     
 chairman (1985). The main functions   
 and concerns are: expressing to the   
 higher tiers of government the        
 opinions  of those in the parishes,   
 e.g. the routing of heavy lorries,    
 care of the environment and the       
 illegal siting of mobile homes;       
 roads in the district are inspected;  
 rights of parishioners are defended;  
 it has concern for the welfare of the 
 young. The parish rate is two pence   
 in the Â£. and the majority is spent   
 maintaining the recreation ground     
 and pavillion. Similar parish councils
 exist in the other areas  but all come
 under Winchester City Council, to whom
 rates are paid.                       </content>
