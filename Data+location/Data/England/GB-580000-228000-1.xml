		<content>{Halstead}is a small market town with a
 population of 10,000 plus 800 in the  
 village of Greenstead Green. Friday is
 the main market day, Wednesday is     
 early closing. Lots of people used to 
 work at Courtaulds Mill but it is now 
 derelict and about to be restored as a
 restaurant. Factory Terrace is a row  
 of old 3 storey cottages built in     
 1872. The mill workers used to live   
 and work there. You can visit the     
 police station and the cells, and the 
 bandstand in the park. There is a     
 lovely walk at Box Mill. The building 
 behind the council offices, the       
 brewery chapel, is being made into a  
 museum. There is a cinema. If you want
 somewhere to stay try the Bull Hotel  
 by the river or the White Hart on the 
 hill. They are both very old.
