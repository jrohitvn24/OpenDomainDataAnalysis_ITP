		<content>{     Ollerton Colliery}is the primary 
 reason why the present-day village of 
 New Ollerton exists.                  
      The pit first produced coal      
 in 1926.The total cost of establishing
 the colliery, including new housing   
 for the workers,was about             
 Â£1,500,000.Since that date both the   
 pit and the village have expanded     
 considerably.                         
      There are 1240 people working at 
 the colliery (plus seven canaries!),  
 and current{production}is 4,500 tonnes
 per day.Approximately 70% of the      
 workforce live within our Domesday    
 Survey area.                          
      Four-fifths of the coal produced 
 goes to Trent Valley power stations   
 (mainly by rail),while the remainder  
 goes to industrial users,some of them 
 abroad.
