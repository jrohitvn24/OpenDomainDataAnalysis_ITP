		<title>18VILLAGE LIFE</title>
		<content> For employment the majority of working
 people have to travel out of the vill-
 ages. Farmwork now occupies few people
 -1 man per 200 acres.A few, mostly    
 women, work in gangs which visit farms
 to work in the fields as needed. There
 is employment at Raynham R.A.F.,some  
 self employment, unemployment, &amp; many 
 go to the towns or further &amp; return   
 home only at weekends. Nearly all     
 families own at least 1 car.Public    
 transport is limited. There is a twice
 daily National Bus service to London  
 but there are local buses to King's   
 Lynn &amp; Fakenham only on market days.  
 On the recreation field there is a    
 cricket pitch which is used by various
 organisations but there is no actual  
 village team. A well-supported village
 bowls team plays there. Some villagers
 belong to a local Citizens Band (C.B.)
 Radio club.Much television is watched.</content>
