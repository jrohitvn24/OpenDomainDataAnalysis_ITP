		<title>01DESCRIPTION OF WILTON AREA</title>
		<content> Lazenby,Lackenby,Kirkleatham and      
 Wilton comprise the major areas of    
 settlement,these are long established 
 villages,unlike the Whalehill Estate  
 which provides an example of a        
 re-housing programme.The area,though  
 largely rural contains a large part of
 the giant I.C.I chemical complex.     
 Inevitably I.C.I has had a significant
 effect on the people.It has provided  
 employment but it has also brought    
 with it the horrors of industrial     
 pollution.The people,a high proportion
 of elderly,have spent most if not     
 all,of their lives in the area,and    
 though aware of todays problems,seem  
 fairly contented.                     
 And of the future? In a nuclear age.  
 Who knows?
