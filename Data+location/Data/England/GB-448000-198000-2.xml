		<title>02Changing Times in Abingdon</title>
		<content>    Local people who have lived in the 
area between 14 and 33 years were      
interviewed. The main change, they     
agreed, was from a rural community to  
an urban one. The majority of the area 
had been farmland with no major        
landmarks. The development of the      
bypass and housing estates,            
particularly Peachcroft, changed the   
area dramatically. The College of      
Further Education was extended and the 
number of primary schools was          
increased. Many jobs were within easy  
travelling distance.                   
    Generally life had improved but it 
was felt development should now stop   
and more recreational facilities should
be provided.                           
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
