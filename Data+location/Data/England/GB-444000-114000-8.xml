		<title>08ALLINGTON WOOD</title>
		<content> Allington Wood is a small area of     
 coniferous and deciduous{woodland}    
 administered by the Forestry          
 Commission. The area is rich in       
 wildlife and at the time we visited,  
 some parts of the{landscape}were      
 carpeted with bluebells.              
 Close to the centre of the wood there 
 is a reservoir owned by Portsmouth    
 Water Company. The reservoir was      
 opened in 1981. Water is taken from   
 the River Itchen and, for{health}     
 reasons, cleaned and purified and     
 pumped to Wickham 9 miles away. Each  
 week the water is tested for bacteria 
 and it is found that{poliomyelitis}is 
 still present in the river.
