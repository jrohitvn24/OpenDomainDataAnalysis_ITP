		<title>16THE VET</title>
		<content>    Mr Barnes is his own boss.He does  
 not have to go in to work at any      
 specific time,as long as he is there  
 in time for surgery.                  
   {Three vets share the practice.}Two 
 of the vets may move on later.There   
 are two assistants and Mrs Barnes.They
 help to hold animals and write notes  
 on cards.{The vets work 9.00 am to    
{about 9.00 pm.Unless they are on night
{duty.Usualy work 130_140 hours in a   
{week.Half of their work is with       
{small animals.                        
{   Mr Barnes works within 25 miles of 
{his surgery.}His furthest client lives
 in York.Some of the farmers move to   
 different farms,but they like to keep 
 the same vet.In the surgery he has a  
 small sterilizing kettle,a little     
 x_ray machine,he cannot afford all the
 equipment he would like.{There is no  
 N.H.S. for animals.                   </content>
