		<content> We walked South from South Lodge to   
 identify trees and land use on managed
 woodlands. To the right of the lane   
 was an area where the trees had been  
 felled and replanted with Larch and   
 Oak now three years old. Piles of     
 timber were stacked along the lane.   
 Beyond this in 14 Acre Rough there was
 a plantation of oak trees 15-20 years 
 old. Light could penetrate between    
 these trees and there was undergrowth 
 of bluebells and grass. In this area  
 were pheasant pens. Next was an area  
 of planted fir trees, larch and Scots 
 pine. They grew taller than the       
 telegraph poles which stood among them
 and grew close together, letting      
 little light onto the forest floor,   
 where there was little undergrowth.   
 Along the lane there were             
 horse-chestnuts and yew trees growing.
