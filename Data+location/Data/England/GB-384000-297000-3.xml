Perton Village is a popular place to   
settle in for new couples and families.
Here builders have constructed many    
new houses for families to move into.  
There are a wide range of different    
house here built by many building      
companies. The companies have          
unfortunately forgotten the children - 
there is no real Playing Fields, as    
yet.                                   
  Before Perton Village existed it was 
an area of farming land and before that
it was a Royal Air Force Airfield.     
Today it is still surrounded by        
farmland and areas of picturesque      
woodland.
