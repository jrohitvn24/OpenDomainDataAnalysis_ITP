		<content> The variation in soil type because of 
 the underlying geology is reflected in
 the vegetation found in the area.     
 To the South are the chalk downs with 
 steep scarp slopes followed by        
 sandstone.  A narrow outcrop of gault 
 clay overlying sandstone is to be     
 found to the north.                   
 Greensand is prevalent in the north,  
 providing the best type of sand for   
 the building industry.                
 The weather is slightly warmer on the 
 dip slope of the downs because the    
 cool air collects at the foot of the  
 scarp slope, illustrated by it being  
 the last place for morning mists to   
 clear.                                
 Footpaths and bridleways are well     
 marked including the part of the      
 Southdown Way used by ramblers.
