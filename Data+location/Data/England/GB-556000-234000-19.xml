		<title>19Teenagers in Wimbish</title>
		<content> Living in a small village does have   
 its disadvantages, especially for     
 teenagers. The distances involved in  
 travelling from one village to        
 another, or to a town, are large      
 enough to make meeting up with friends
 and going to social occasions very    
 difficult. Wimbish has only a limited 
 bus service, so we either have to be  
 taken everywhere by car, or we have to
 cycle. Even within the village itself 
 there is little to cater for young    
 people of the 13 to 18 age range. A   
 youth club or some sort of regular    
 club would benefit an isolated hamlet 
 such as Tye Green.There used to be    
 discos in the Village Hall, but these 
 were stopped due to the damage being  
 done to the premises. Equally, it is  
 difficult getting a part time job to  
 earn some pocket-money, as most job   
 opportunities are outside the village.</content>
