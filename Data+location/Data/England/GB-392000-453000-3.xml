		<title>03Gargrave,    Farming.</title>
		<content> About half the farms in the area  are 
 owned by the farmers,  and  half  are 
 rented.   Nobody  grows  anything  but
{grass    }There are{Cattle dealers}but
 most of the farms are{dairy farms.}The
 milk goes either to a dairy,  or local
 milk rounds . Many local people prefer
{Green Top Milk }and  are  opposed to  
 thoughts that it should be outlawed.  
 The farmers own between 50 and 200    
 cows  each, and cows give up to 35    
 litres of milk a day. Most farms have 
 a bull. A few{beef cattle}are kept on 
 each farm, and between them the       
 farmers have about 1,000{sheep.} Not  
 many farmers employ workers, but some 
 of them have their sons working with  
 them.
