		<content>{ Our area is situated at the S.W. edge
 of the Greater Manchester             
 connurbation, on the edge of the      
 Pennine Hills. There has been a       
 sizeable community here since the     
 early 18th.century when the swiftly   
 flowing streams were harnessed to     
 provide water power for a large       
 number of small cotton mills. As the  
 mills became larger, the population of
 the area grew to keep pace. When later
{Samuel Oldknow}began to mine coal in  
 the area, then began transporting     
 limestone via the canal from          
 Derbyshire to burn in lime kilns in   
 Marple and finally owned the largest  
 mill, the prosperity of the area      
 seemed assured.                       
  Unfortunately the cotton business    
 began to decline, but by this time the
 roads and railways had enabled Marple 
 and district to become commuter land. </content>
