		<title>04THE FARMING YEAR 2</title>
		<content> These break crops are oil seed        
 rape,sugar beet and beans .The beans  
 that they grow have nitrogen in them  
 so the soil has already got fertilizer
 for the next years harvest.Around     
 about 25th of July harvest starts and 
 the combine (Class a german combine)  
 starts to bring in the harvest.The    
 wide cuttingbar is about 4 metres long
 and seperates straw from the grain    
 then stored in a tank until the       
 trailer comes.After it has been       
 harvested the grain is then emptied   
 into a trailer and taken away. Barley 
 is used for malt and beer,wheat is    
 used for animal food or making biscuit
 flour, oil seed rape is sent to Hull  
 to produce low grade vegetable oil.   
 Then the winter sugar beet is lifted  
 and sent to Bury St Edmunds to be     
 refined into sugar and animal feed.
