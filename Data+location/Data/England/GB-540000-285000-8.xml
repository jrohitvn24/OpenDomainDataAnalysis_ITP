		<content> Sugar beet is a very profitable root  
 crop which was not introduced into the
 Fens until the 1920's.  In those days 
 it was transported by barge to be sold
 but now it is moved by lorry.  The    
 nearest factory is at Peterborough.   
 Before the land was turned over to    
 arable farming there were sheep on the
 Fens.  Nowadays sheep are being       
 re-introduced.  They eat the beet tops
 which would otherwise just be         
 ploughed back into the soil.  In the  
 summer wheat is harvested.  When the  
 stubble is burnt there are lots of    
 fires which burn out of control.  Many
 local people protest each year about  
 stubble burning.  Nowadays wheat is   
 harvested by combine but in the olden 
 days men had to work with sickles.    
 The bailer now puts the straw into    
 bundles making another job easier.
