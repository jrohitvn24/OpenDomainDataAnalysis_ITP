		<content>  Leisure activities are centred on the
 playing field and village hall. The   
 playing field, situated on the north  
 side of the church, is home for the   
 Stambourne Cricket Club and Stambourne
 Lions, a junior football team. It also
 hosts two annual events - a November  
 5th bonfire with firework display and 
 a summer fete - which involve and     
 attract most of the village. The      
 village hall is the meeting place of  
 groups such as the Women's Institute  
 (monthly), the Abelard Canine Academy 
  - dog obedience and agility classes -
 (twice weekly), Silver Link Club for  
 the over 60's (fortnightly), a dancing
 club (monthly) and the Stambourne     
 Players, an amateur dramatic society  
 (twice weekly ). Annual events include
 the Harvest Supper and a children's   
 Christmas party. Dances, jumble sales,
 &amp;c are held in the village hall.      </content>
