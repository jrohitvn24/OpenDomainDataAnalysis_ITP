 retired.Of those employed,the chief   
 occupations are professional and      
 scientific,agricultural related,and   
 private services.Of secondary         
 importance are manufacturing,         
 construction,distributive trades,     
 insurance and banking.The majority    
 leave Marnhull to work.Employment     
 within the village is largely on farms
 and in the shops.One farm has a small 
 sideline constructing agricultural    
 buildings,and there is a joinery      
 works.Pubs,shops,schools and garages  
 employ a few full-time,but more part- 
 time.Generally Marnhull provides a    
 place to live for those who work      
 elsewhere.Unemployment is low,less
