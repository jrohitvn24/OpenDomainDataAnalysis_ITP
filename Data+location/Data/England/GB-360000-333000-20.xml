		<title>20Wyrley Cottages and Wood.</title>
		<content>   Wyrley cottages were built in 1871, 
 the same date as our school.There were
 two cottages but now they have been   
 made into one cottage.There is a      
 family of four people living there and
 the father works at a nearby farm.Next
 to Wyrley cottages there used to be   
 two little farms.                     
    The fields around the cottages are 
 used for wheat and pastureland.The    
 field on the right is called the      
 Windmill field which goes behind the  
 Wyrley wood.A long time ago the       
 windmill which is no longer there     
 pumped water for all the area.        
   The wood was called Cranberry Moss  
 because it was the only wood on the   
 estate with cranberries in it.One of  
 the oak trees is 830 cms around the   
 trunk.We found an interesting bottle  
 in the wood.
