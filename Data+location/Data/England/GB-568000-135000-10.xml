		<content>   There used to be several shops in   
the village. When the last one, which  
was also the post office, closed some  
years ago, the village took over the   
church institute, built in 1880, which 
was then a builder's store.            
   In 1980 it was re-opened as the     
Quarry Centre. The Quarry Centre opens 
every Tuesday as a Post Office and     
shop with sweets, plants, home made    
produce and vegetables.                
   The Quarry Centre won the National  
Village Ventures Award for 1982-3.     
   Mrs Macey is the sub-postmistress.  
Other ladies take turns to run the     
produce stall and sweet counter.       
   On Mondays and Fridays Doctor Hugo  
and Doctor Johnson hold their surgeries
in a room in the Centre. A quilting    
group use the Quarry Centre on some    
mornings making quilts for village     
charities.                             </content>
