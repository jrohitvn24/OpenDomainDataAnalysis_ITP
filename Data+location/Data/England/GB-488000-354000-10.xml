		<content> I went to see{ Lionel Dunning}the     
 professional show jumper who lives on 
 High Street to ask him some           
 questions.He said he had lived in the 
 village since 1973.He said he had 20  
 horses.He first got involved with     
 horses when he was 10.He enters about 
 50 shows a year.I then asked him which
 is his best horse,he said William     
 Curtis.He said his best achievement in
 horse jumping was 6 double clear      
 rounds in 1 year on 1 horse in the    
 Nations Cup.He said that he and his   
 wife enter many shows together.A      
 person would expect to pay about      
 Â£25,000 for a good horse he said.Then 
 I asked what advice would he give to  
 someone who wanted to become a        
 horse jumper and he said,"No          
 don't".I finally asked him which book 
 about him does he like best. He       
 replied,"Dead Lucky".                 </content>
