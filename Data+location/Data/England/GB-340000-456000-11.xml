		<content>The religious needs of the community   
were originally met by the parish      
church at Overton.At one time there was
evidence of the past existence of a    
Quaker cemetery.It seems likely there  
was a stong Quaker tradition in the    
area.It was the Primitive Methodists   
who gave the village its first place   
of worship.Before this,the areaÂ£s      
Methodists met for worship in their    
farm cottages.                         
The trustees were from local families, 
largely farmers,and the connections of 
many of these families with the Chapel 
are still strong.The Chapel,the only   
church in the village,exerts a strong  
influence on the community.It is the   
only country chapel in the Morecambe   
Methodist Circuit;built in 1967 to     
replace a smaller building on a site   
which has since vanished.
