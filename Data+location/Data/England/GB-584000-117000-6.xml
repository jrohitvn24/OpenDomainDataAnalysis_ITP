		<title>06DISTRICT ADMINISTRATION</title>
		<content> Our parish is part of the Rural       
 District of Rother.  The District     
 Council is responsible for Council    
 Housing, Public Health, Recreation and
 Tourism, and Planning.  We share a    
 Council member with Brede, the next   
 village.  East Sussex County Council  
 looks after roads, schools, libraries 
 etc.  We are part of Winchelsea       
 polling district. Elections for these 
 two Councils, and for the Parish      
 Council take place every four years.  
 The Parish Council consists of five   
 members and no politics are involved  
 in the election of these.  Their      
 function is to pin_point and provide  
 very local amenities, and to act as a 
 pressure group and liaison body where 
 communication with outside bodies is  
 necessary.  We are part of the        
 Parlimentary constituency of Battle   
 and Bexhill.  Our M>P> is Mr.Wardle.a </content>
