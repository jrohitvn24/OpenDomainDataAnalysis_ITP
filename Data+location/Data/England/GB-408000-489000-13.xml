		<title>13RECREATION-OVER 60 CLUB</title>
		<content> An 'Over 60 Club' is organised and    
 meets in Leyburn once a week. It is   
 held in a local cafe. The members who 
 are all retired people pay a weekly   
 fee of 10p which covers the cost of   
 the refreshments which are provided.  
 The afternoon is spent playing games  
 such as Whist and Dominoes. Prizes are
 given to the winners and also those   
 who score the least number of points. 
 When any member has a birthday or     
 wedding anniversary to celebrate there
 is usually a party given on the club  
 afternoon nearest to the actual day.  
 The committee organise one full-day   
 outing each year and three or four    
 half-day outings for the members.     
 Visits to the theatre are also        
 arranged at Christmas time.
