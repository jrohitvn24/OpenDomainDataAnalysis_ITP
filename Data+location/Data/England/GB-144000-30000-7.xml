		<title>07PENZANCE DRY DOCK</title>
		<content>  The average number of boats that they
 get in the dry dock is about 35,but it
 depends on how long they take to      
 repair.They've never had a busiest day
 as every day is busy. They've had     
 ships that have had too much work on  
 to do,but instead of moving them to   
 another dry dock,they put them into   
 the floating dock and get more men.   
 The next ship they're expecting is a  
 light vessel or an oil tanker. They   
 have had water leaking in after       
 they've pumped it out.Only once       
 they've had a vessel that's had to go 
 to the scrapyard.                     
  The longest time that the workmen    
 have repaired a boat is 3 months.There
 are 70 men down there.The main        
 materials that they use are metal     
 plates,pipes and spare parts. Penzance
 is the{only dry dock}to make a manned 
 lightship into an automatic one.  Alv.</content>
