		<content> The{Bold Forester public house} is a  
 smart and popular meeting place some  
 two kilometres west of the village of 
 Marchwood.Although it is rather       
 isolated it attracts many customers   
 from a wide area.It has a large bar   
 and meals are served.They have a      
 garden with picnic tables in.Also     
 inside they have a skittle alley.     
      The pub started off as a thatched
 cottage.The first landlord was a      
 forester himself.He employed people to
 chop trees down.While they worked they
 would get hot and thirsty.The landlord
 would give them eight pints of beer a 
 day and would deduct the cost from    
 their salaries.The landlord would then
 transport the wood to different places
 and it would be used as firewood,for  
 farm buildings,gates and fences.
