		<content> There are 447 adults &amp; 120 children,  
 workers not employed locally commute  
 to Dereham, Norwich, Swanton Morley   
 and 3 travel to Lotus at Hethel. Of   
 the children, 22 attend playgroup and 
 fifty 5 to 11 year olds go to the     
 village Primary School. Older children
 taken by coach to Reepham High School 
 are educated to GCE O level standard. 
 Many activities take place in the     
 Village Hall, erected as a 1918 War   
 Memorial and intended to last only 10 
 years! "The Reeves Tale", a duplicated
 magazine of Foxley and Bawdeswell, is 
 delivered to each house every month.  
 The Parish Church of All Saints       
 was built in 1955 in Georgian style to
 replace one destroyed by a damaged RAF
 Mosquito aircraft during the 1939-45  
 War. There is also a Methodist Chapel,
 but the Gospel Hall has recently      
 closed.                               </content>
