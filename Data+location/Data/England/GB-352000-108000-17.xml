		<content> The people of Halstock are much less  
 dependent than those of Pendomer on   
 having cars for shopping and leisure  
 activities. Older people who no longer
 drive can obtain nearly all their     
 needs in the village shop or from     
 travelling tradesmen and for "extras" 
 there is the weekly bus to Yeovil.    
 There is a good range of clubs and    
 entertainment in the village, which   
 has the advantage of being fairly     
 compact. In all, it is a pleasant,    
 friendly place for senior citizens -  
 though medical care may pose more     
 problems. For young people, the       
 situation is more difficult. There is 
 the youth club, but not much else, so 
 they are dependent on parents and     
 others to drive them around for many  
 of their leisure activities - which   
 can be frustrating and unsatisfactory 
 for both sides!                       </content>
