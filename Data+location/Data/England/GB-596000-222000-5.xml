		<title>05Children's playground games</title>
		<content> Children from our class did a survey  
 on children's playground games.We     
 found out that the most poupular games
 were{"Tig around the tree,Hide and    
{seek,Kiss chase,Sticky toffee, cops   
{and robber's.These games are played   
 all around the year.We found out that}
 all of these games have a set of      
 rules.Most children said that they    
 they had learned the rules by         
 listening, watching and joining in    
 with other children in the playground.
 Hardly any of the games need any kind 
 of equipment.Before they can be       
 played.Every one in the class was able
 to name 10 or more games (Range 10-26)
