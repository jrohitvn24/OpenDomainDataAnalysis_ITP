		<title>11Interview with Riverside M.P</title>
		<content> Riverside is a new consituency, formed
 from  the old  Aigburth  and  Vauxhall
 constituencies. Mr Robert Parry of the
 Labour Party is its first M.P.        
 He  believes  that  the {International
{Garden Festival }has  put Liverpool on
 on  the  map, providing  badly  needed
 jobs  and  trade for local businesses,
 albeit for a limited period.          
 He feels that  the  major  problems in
 the area are unemployment, (especially
 for youngsters), crime, vandalism,drug
 taking and poor housing.  However, new
 legislation on hard drugs and the city
 council's  designation  of the area as
 a{HOUSING PRIORITY AREA}should improve
 the present situation.                
 With the  local bottling plant soon to
 close, the future for Riverside  looks
 grim, although  Mr.Parry believes that
 the general situation could improve if
 the right action were taken.          </content>
