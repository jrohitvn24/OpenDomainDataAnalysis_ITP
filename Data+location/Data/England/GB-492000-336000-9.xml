 and its two majestic avenues of trees 
 offers a herd of fallow deer grazing  
 &amp; running space. One of the avenues to
 the S of the house was recently cut   
 drastically to remove diseased &amp;      
 dangerous trees.  Majestic Chestnut   
 and Proud Oaks dot the park. To the S 
 &amp; E is the outstanding local Golf     
 Course which has a large &amp; thriving   
 membership.  The game being played in 
 the most attractive of settings.

 in the country, carved out of the     
 estate lands it has 27 holes. Recently
 a 73 year old member scored his second
 hole in one at the 152 yard hole. He  
 was given a coveted Johnnie Walker    
 international award; a hand scripted  
 parchment certificate, a gold golf bag
 &amp; a bottle of fine 12 year old whisky.
