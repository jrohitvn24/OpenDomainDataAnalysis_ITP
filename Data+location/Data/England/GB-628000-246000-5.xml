		<title>05METHERSGATE HALL : SUTTON</title>
		<content> The Drive to{Methersgate Hall}is lined
 with coniferous and deciduous trees   
 and beyond this are fields sown with  
 sugar beet and barley.                
                                       
 It is a private drive but is open to  
 pedestrian access only, this is       
 because pheasants are bred in this    
 area for the shooting season and it is
 patrolled by gamekeepers.             
                                       
 Some fields are left uncultivated and 
 used as grazing for sheep and horses. 
                                       
 On the route there is a farm called   
{Cliff Farm}overlooking one of the many
 small woods.                          
                                       
 The length of the drive is            
 approximately one and a half miles.   
                                       
                                       </content>
