		<title>09THE POSTBUS</title>
		<content>                                       
   On the 27th of June 1985 some of us 
went to see one of the last            
postbuses from Gislingham. It is       
stopping because it costs too much to  
run and the council wonÂ£t pay the      
cost.                                  
      The driver has driven the postbus
for ten years. The postbus is a        
minibus, the postman collects          
passengers and letters. The fare was   
ten pence from Wickham Skeith to Stoke 
Ash. The bus is going to Norwich after 
closing down. The day after we were in 
the East Anglian Daily Times. The      
postbus goes to lots of places. The    
postbus has sixty to eighty passengers 
a week. The driver doesn't want the bus
to close down because the passengers   
are like a family to him. We asked     
the postmistress whether people would  
miss the bus, she said "Yes a lot".    </content>
