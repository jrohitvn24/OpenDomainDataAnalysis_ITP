		<content>  Most property has been built of      
 locally quarried granite with slate   
 roofing. Most property in Milton      
 Coombe dates back to the 16th century 
 when many were used by local industry 
 i.e. four were part of the cider      
 press. Remains of such industry are   
 often found today as home owners      
 renovate properties, increasing house 
 prices dramatically. More modern brick
 built houses form a small estate of   
 six properties in the village and a   
 few others may be found close to the  
 Moorland Links Hotel. Maristow Estate 
 property is generally rented from the 
 estate by its employees, a pattern    
 which has changed little over the     
 years. One small area that offers     
 change is at Barn Farm (1702) where   
 the owner wishes to develop 18 acres  
 to holiday cottages and caravan park  
 arousing strong local opposition.     </content>
