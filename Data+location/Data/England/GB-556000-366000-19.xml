		<title>191953 Floods</title>
		<content> The floods came on the evening of     
 Saturday,31st January 1953.Some of the
 villagers took a lorry to Skegness    
 Boating Lake and collected the boats, 
 to help rescue the people trapped in  
 bungalows at Ingoldmells Point. They  
 could not row the boats for fear of   
 being carried out to sea,so they had  
 to walk with water up to their waists 
 pushing them.Often they stepped into a
 dyke and then the water rose to their 
 necks.Fortunately the landlord at the 
 Ship Inn had stoked up his fires to   
 dry the rescuers' clothes.Then he     
 warmed them up with double measures of
 spirits (free).Many people were       
 rescued - some even from the bungalow 
 roof - but despite all their efforts  
 17 lost their lives.The tragedy was   
 none need have died if they had put a 
 chair on the table - and stayed there 
 - not easy under the circumstances.   </content>
