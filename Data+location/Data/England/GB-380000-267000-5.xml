		<title>05Battery Hens By E.Hinxman</title>
		<content> Mr Jones is one of the largest land   
 owners in our area.He has 2 chicken   
 houses on his farm with 10,000        
 chickens in each of them.He buys day  
 old chicks and sells them at 49 days  
 old to "Chuckie Chicken"for freezing. 
 Some of the hens are kept for egg     
 production.The battery hens are kept  
 inside.Two women are employed to feed 
 them,clean them out and make sure they
  are healthy they also collect the    
 eggs.I do not agree with battery hens 
 because it is not natural,all they do 
 is lay eggs and get fattened up to be 
 sold,killed and eaten.I prefer the    
 free range method as it is more       
 natural for the hens to live outside, 
 they are healthier and I think it is  
 kinder.
