 In our survey we asked Harrold        
 residents for their main occupations. 
 A complete cross-section of types of  
 employment was represented in our     
 findings.                             
 As predicted many of our sample were  
 managers, administrators,accountants  
 and other similar occupations.Teachers
 and lecturers were also represented in
 our survey.                           
 The local leatherworks and Bridgman's,
 manufacturing fire-doors,employed     
 several people, either as operatives  
 or as foremen.                        
 Surprisingly in a country community   
 none of the people surveyed were farm 
 managers or farm-workers.             
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
