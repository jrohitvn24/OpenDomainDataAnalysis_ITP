		<title>17FARMING IN NETHERBURY</title>
		<content> Within the block there are:           
 l beef farm, 2 fruit farms, mainly    
 apple, l arable farm, wheat/barley, 2 
 sheep farms, l4 dairy farms.          
 The area consists mainly of dairy     
 farming, due to good grass, and the   
 fields are small and often hilly, so  
 not cost effective for arable farming 
 with large tractors.  Some dairy farms
 also fatten beef calves.  Out of a    
 total of 20 farms, 14 are mainly dairy
 and one is a large beef unit.  There  
 is one arable farm in the north centre
 of the block where hedgerows have been
 removed and larger fields made, where 
 wheat and barley are grown.  Most     
 of the farms are owner or tenant      
 occupied.  There are also 2 small     
 sheep farms where sheep run on the    
 hill fields.  There are 2 large fruit 
 farms growing apples, pears and soft  
 fruit.                                </content>
