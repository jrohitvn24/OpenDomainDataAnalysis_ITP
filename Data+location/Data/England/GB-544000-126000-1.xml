		<title>01NUTLEY, ASHDOWN FOREST</title>
		<content> Our area includes the villages of     
 Nutley and Fairwarp and Duddleswell.  
 Lying between the churches of St.James
 the Less at Nutley and Christchurch at
 Fairwarp is an area of forest of      
 exceptional natural beauty which is of
 great interest because of its wild    
 life and plants.                      
 Only a few truly local people live in 
 the forest, the majoritynow being     
 commuters and retired people. The area
 is very attractive to tourists, a boon
 to Londoners in particular because it 
 is half way to the coast: it          
 offers good recreational facilities   
 for naturalists, walkers and horse    
 riders.                               
 This area is worthy of continued      
 interest and of protection by         
 conservationists.
