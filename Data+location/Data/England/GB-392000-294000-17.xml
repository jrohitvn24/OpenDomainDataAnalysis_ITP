		<title>17Male unemployment in Bilston</title>
		<content>Bilston, a traditional area for heavy  
industry, has suffered from the re-    
location of iron and steel works to    
coastal sites. British Steel provided  
many of the local population with work,
but since its closure in 1979 the area 
has experienced high unemployment. It  
is noticeable that more men are helping
their wives with shopping, and the     
traditional role of "breadwinner" is   
changing. They are more involved with  
housework,child rearing,and decorating.
More men are seen pushing prams and    
pushchairs while mother is at work.    
Others spend more time watching TV,    
sleeping, drinking more,especially at  
lunchtime when other unemployed friends
gravitate to the local pub. Many school
pupils seem resigned to not obtaining  
jobs and truancy has increased. Exams  
are seen as less important;and a sense 
of apathy prevails in the classroom.   </content>
