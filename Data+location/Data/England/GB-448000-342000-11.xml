		<title>11 Life on Strelley Estate</title>
		<content>    An owner-occupier on the council   
 estate says:                          
   "When I was little, before all these
 houses were built, it used to be all  
 humps and hollows where you could play
 marbles and hide and seek and ride on 
 go carts. But now it is built up I    
 don't think that the children at this 
 end of the estate have got anywhere   
 where they can play games like        
 football without being told off all   
 the time.                             
   When I was young we used to go up to
{Strelley Village}a lot and there used 
 to be sand banks where we used to ride
 on our go carts and we used to make   
 caves in the humps and hollows. But   
 now the sand banks have been flattened
 down by the motorway.{Strelley Estate 
 has deteriorated a lot over the years.
 Now there's a lot of vandalism        
 especially near the shops."           </content>
