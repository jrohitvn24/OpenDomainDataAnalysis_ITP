		<title>06TRANSPORT IN THE AREA</title>
		<content> There is no public bus service in this
 area due to its being a rural region. 
 The population of the area in question
 is very scattered.An obvious          
 disadvantage being of course that the 
 bus would have to cover a large number
 of miles,often down very narrow       
 country lanes,to collect just one or  
 two people.Consequently a bus service 
 in this district, is not economically 
 viable.Furthermore, the majority of   
 people who live in a country district,
 recognize the  necessity of owning    
 their own transport.Hence the bone of 
 contention which has become a         
 political issue, namely the escalated 
 and escalating cost of petrol.A       
 private bus company has a contract to 
 transport the children to school,     
 where they beaver away,gleefully, on  
 the Domesday project!
