   "Half-past eight", Mum says. My eyes
 open slowly and I put my feet out of  
 the bed. I walk down stairs with the  
 music blaring away.                   
    My Mum says "Come and eat your     
 breakfast,it will get cold." Everyone 
 is wide awake except me.Dad's gone to 
 work, Mum's reading the paper, my     
 little brother's trying to get dressed
 for playschool, my older sisters are  
 listening to their tapes before going 
 to work and Suzie's getting ready for 
 school.My sister says "You'll be late"
 and she isn't even ready herself!     
   I beat my sister to school and the  
 register is called."Claire,  school", 
 I say. We walk down to assembly and   
 listen to a story. After assembly we  
 have  English. I am writing a story   
 about a family on holiday. Then at    
 playtime we play 'British Bulldog'.   </content>
