		<title>01BURNHAM MARKET</title>
		<content>    Burnham Market is situated two     
 miles from the North Norfolk coast, 20
 miles from King's Lynn and 40 miles   
 from Norwich. The area covered by this
 survey forms the southern part of the 
 village and is primarily agricultural,
 though there is a large amount of     
 council housing in the north eastern  
 corner of the survey block. Most of   
 the village services (shops, school,  
 churches) are in the survey block to  
 the north, the doctors' surgery       
 and village hall being the principal  
 exceptions. The surrounding farmland  
 is mostly Grade 3 agricultural land   
 and varies in height from 25 to 212   
 feet above sea level.                 
    Our village is a thriving service  
 centre and is popular with holiday-   
 makers: there is a caravan site and   
 many of the cottages are holiday      
 homes.                                </content>
