 main areas of housing seperated by Fox
 Lane. The Frecheville houses were     
 built in 1936 by H.Boot and Sons. The 
 houses were administered by the First 
 National Housing Trust. Most of the   
 houses have been sold and are now     
 owner-occupied. The Basegreen houses  
 were built by Sheffield City Council  
 in the 1950's.This is an attractive   
 quiet estate with some owner-occupied 
 houses.Basegreen estate was built to  
 house families from many parts of     
 Sheffield.

 council houses,with a growing number  
 of private dwellings.There are a      
 number of blocks of flats for old age
