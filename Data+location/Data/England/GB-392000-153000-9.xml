		<content> Private and Public Transport          
    Most folk find employment and      
 shopping facilities in the nearby     
 larger towns and have at least one    
 car per family. There is also a       
 private car help scheme for the       
 elderly, for visiting doctors,        
 hospitals etc. A limited bus service  
 is available for shopping in Westbury,
 Trowbridge or Devizes. For longer     
 journeys, there is a main line railway
 station in Westbury, 4 miles away, but
 the car is the main form of transport.
    Despite giving the appearance of   
 being set deep in the countryside,    
 Edington is conveniently placed       
 for easy access to many large towns by
 car: Salisbury - 30 minutes, Bath 35  
 minutes, Swindon 40 minutes, and      
 Bristol 50 minutes. For families, the 
 south coast is approx 1 hr 30 minutes 
 and the west coast an hour away.      </content>
