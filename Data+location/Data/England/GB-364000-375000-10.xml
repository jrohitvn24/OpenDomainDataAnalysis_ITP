		<title>10MARBURY PARK, CHESHIRE.</title>
		<content> Marbury Park has been set aside as a  
 place for people to relax and enjoy   
 the pleasures of the countryside. Once
 there was a Hall but it fell into such
 a state of disrepair that it had to be
 pulled down. During the War, the park 
 was used as a prisoner-of-war camp and
 later fell into neglect. Some years   
 ago, it was taken over by the Local   
 Authority which has restored it to its
 present state, providing bird and     
 animal sanctuaries, observation hides 
 and picnic areas. Marbury is becoming 
 increasingly well-known for the wide  
 variety of its wild life and is a     
 favourite place for walks and picnics.
 The park also contains an open-air    
 Swimming Baths which is open from May 
 to September. The average temperature 
 is 68%F, a minimum of 54%F in May and 
 September and a maximum of 76%F in    
 July.                                 </content>
