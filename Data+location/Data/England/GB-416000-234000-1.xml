		<title>01Blockley, a general picture</title>
		<content> Blockley is well known for the        
 outstanding beauty of its countryside 
 and the extensive walks that are      
 available in the surrounding area.    
        Most of the property in        
 Blockley is built from Cotswold stone 
 and there is a fairly large Council   
 House Estate on the outskirts of the  
 village. There are many weekend       
 cottages used by holiday makers and   
 accomodation is plentiful.            
        There are many old silk mills  
 that have now been converted into     
 private housing and most of the shops 
 are to be found along the very narrow 
 High Street.                          
        The village is steeped in      
 history and is centrally situated to  
 give acces to the many surrounding    
 places of interest.
