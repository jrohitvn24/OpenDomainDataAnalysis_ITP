		<title>16Dovercourt's Rector's Day:am</title>
		<content>{The Rector of Dovercourt's day        
 typically begins when he gets up at   
 7am and has breakfast. He then spends 
 about half an hour at his desk,       
 dealing with the morning post and any 
 phone messages. At 8.30am he and the  
 other clergy team members are in      
 church to say the daily office. At    
 9.10am he is at the local Church of   
 England School (All Saints) for their 
 Assembly. Next comes the service of   
 Eucharist at 10am in the church. The  
 Rector then takes the Sacrament to the
 housebound and sick. At about 11.30   
 a.m he returns home to study and      
 continue working on sermons and Bible 
 study outlines for the weeks ahead.   
 This takes until lunchtime.           
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
