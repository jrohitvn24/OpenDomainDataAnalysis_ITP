		<content> Rising from the valley of the River   
 Rea, Cleobury nestles at the very foot
 of Clee Hill. It has two main         
 features, a beautiful church (partly  
 Norman) with a crooked spire, and a   
 twisting, undulating, main street     
 where the town's commercial           
 establishments are to be found. The   
 goods and services they offer are many
 and varied. In recent years the main  
 street has been padded out on all     
 sides with residential developments.  
 Currently houses are being constructed
 on Lea View  and Tenbury Road.        
 The town has a large population of    
 senior citizens for whom special      
 provisions are made, such as bungalow 
 accommodation, meals on wheels, Darby 
 and Joan Club, free transport to and  
 from the Medical Centre and, recently,
 a Day Centre. A monthly charity coach 
 trip is organised for them.           </content>
