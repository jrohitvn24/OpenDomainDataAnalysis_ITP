		<title>06LOCAL HISTORY_ST.PIRAN.</title>
		<content> St.Piran was a saint who came to      
 Cornwall many years ago.The legend    
 says he travelled on a millstone      
 from Ireland and landed in Perran     
 porth.At this very point he built an  
 oratory,which can still be located    
 today,although it has been covered    
 with sand.                            
 St.Piran is also credited with the    
 discovery of tin.Having built a fire  
 place with stones,the legend goes,he  
 then discovered one of the stones had 
 altered to tin.                       
 St.Pirans flag is a white cross on a  
 black background_this represents two  
 different things_tin from the black   
 rock,and the light of Christ shining  
 in the darkness of the world.         
 St.Piran remains closely associated   
 with Perranporth even to this day.    
 Arguments still persist,today,whether 
 he is the patron saint of all Cornwall</content>
