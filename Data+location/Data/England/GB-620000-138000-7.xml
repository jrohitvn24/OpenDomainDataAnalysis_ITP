		<content> The Chapel was opened in 1833.The     
 building was extended in 1873 with    
 stained glass windows and clock tower.
 There are 2 services on Sundays, at   
 10-30am and 5-00pm. There is usually a
 congregation of about 70. On Sunday   
 mornings there is also a Sunday School
 for the children. This takes place in 
 a separate room whilst the main       
 service takes place in the Chapel.    
   A house group meets on a Monday     
 evening to read the Bible and say     
 Prayers. There is a women's fellowship
 and on a Thursday there is the Good   
 News Club,a club for children.        
   At present there is no Chaplain as  
 the Chapel are finding it difficult to
 find a suitable candidate. The present
 lay preacher and secretary is         
 Mr.M.Ashworth.
