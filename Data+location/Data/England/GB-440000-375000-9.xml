		<content> On Sundays when I have had my         
 breakfast I brush the dog Rusty and   
 take him for a walk round the         
 village.When I get back home I let him
 into the garden and give him a dog    
 biscuit then I go and let the rabbit  
 out for a while but I have to watch   
 him to make sure that he doesn't eat  
 the roses.Sometimes I go to the park  
 or to the field with my friends.Some  
 times we go for a walk down the hill  
 to the railway and walk alongside it  
 to the sports field where we walk     
 round the track then we go through the
 wood and back home.I have to clean my 
 bedroom and dust and polish and hoover
 up.I watch television in the evening  
 or play a game with my mum.           
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
