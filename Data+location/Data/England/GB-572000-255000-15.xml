		<content>Few houses remain thatched in          
Wickhambrook and most of these have    
been modernized. Thatching was once    
cheap. The thatcher was employed on the
farms to thatch the cornstacks &amp;, after
harvest, the houses. No thatch was then
protected by wire as it is now. The    
work cost only a few pounds &amp; not      
thousands as it does today. There      
appear to be more thatched properties  
in Lidgate than Wickhambrook (in       
relation to size). Wickhambrook is a   
much scattered community centred as it 
is on several hamlets-"greens". Most   
new (post 1950) building is near the   
B1063: Coltsfoot Green, Thorns Corner, 
Meeting Gr, Nunnery Gr, and Boyden     
Close. Nunnery Gr &amp; Bunters Rd are the 
only areas of council housing; all     
other modern building is private. Mains
electricity (1950), water (by 1956),   
sewerage (1972) were influential here. </content>
