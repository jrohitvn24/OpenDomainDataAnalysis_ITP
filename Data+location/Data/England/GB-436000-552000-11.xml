		<content>{ Moorhill Day Centre}has between 24   
 and 36 adult clients at a time. This  
 centre and the adjoining residential  
 hostel which can accomodate 19        
 residents, form a complete unit for   
 the rehabilitation of the mentally    
 ill. Life here is intended to prepare 
 clients for independent living, by    
 training them to manage to live alone,
 or in a group.                        
  Most clients living in a hostel      
 accomodation have first attended the  
 day centre before being admitted. This
 is necessary because once living in   
 the hostel they must be able to       
 provide their own meals, do their own 
 laundry, and budget their own money.  
 Cooking, home management, woodwork,   
 gardening, general arts and crafts and
 social activities are included in the 
 programme.
