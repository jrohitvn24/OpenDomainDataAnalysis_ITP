		<title>17Methodism in Endon (1).</title>
		<content>      This year,1985,the Methodists are
celebrating 150 years of the Methodist 
Church in Endon.Methodism was brought  
to the village by a farming family from
nearby Gratton.For some years they met 
together with other Methodists in their
own homes.In 1835,a small chapel was   
built near to the well and it still    
survives today as a private dwelling.It
was a time of Methodist expansion and  
soon it was necessary to have a larger 
building and so in 1875 the present    
church was built on the main road      
opposite the Fountain.                 
      Today it is a thriving community,
having over a hundred members.Sunday   
worship is well attended,the Sunday    
School continues its work with the new 
generation of children and the Women's 
Fellowship is more popular than ever.
