		<content>   Apart from the M.O.D./U.S. base at  
 Menwith Hill, employment in the       
 block is mainly agricultural, e.g.,   
 farming, agricultural contracting, egg
 processing at Springfield Farm; or    
 commuting to jobs mainly in the pro-  
 fessional and commercial sector in the
 neighboring connurbations, e.g.,      
 banking and insurance.  However, there
 are a significant number of self-     
 employed people especially in the     
 higher professional classes, e.g.,    
 antique consultant, interior designer,
 club secretary.  Of the rest, the     
 majority would be retired. Spending of
 incomes, especially through retail    
 outfits, is done mainly in Harrogate, 
 with food shopping through large super
 markets and cash and carries. The only
 shop/Post Office closed earlier this  
 year. Two travelling retail vans (but-
 cher and greengrocer) supply needs.   </content>
