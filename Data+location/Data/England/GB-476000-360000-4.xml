		<content>   Roger Barker took over the{Post     
{Office}in 1982 and set up a General   
 Store on the same premises. He then   
 added a milk round and a paper round. 
 He also does relief milking. He works 
 very long hours to earn his living and
 provide a service for the community.  
   {A Typical Tuesday for Roger is...

 Do milking at Norwell Woodhouse.      
 Take cream to Southwell.              
 Drive to Sneinton Market (Nottingham) 
 to buy fresh fruit and vegetables.    
 Back to the shop for 0500 to set up   
 fruit and vegetables.                 
 Finish off milking.                   
 Drop newspapers off at Carlton,       
 Cromwell, Bathley and South Muskham.  
 Collect bread from Southwell and then 
 deliver to South Muskham.             
 Work in the shop until 1800.
