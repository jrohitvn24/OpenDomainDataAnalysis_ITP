		<content>Most of the area is fertile arable land
with large open fields producing mainly
wheat, barley, sugar beet and oil seed 
rape. There are some small areas of    
grassland for grazing, hay and silage; 
and even smaller areas of maize and    
beet for fodder. Some of the small     
family farms practise mixed farming,   
while the larger farms are almost      
entirely arable. There are a few dairy 
herds,none very large, and some of the 
small farms keep a few beef cattle and 
pigs. There is one intensive pig farm, 
4 fairly large and 1 smaller intensive 
poultry units,also 1 small farm that   
rears turkeys, mainly for Christmas. In
the North-East corner is one intensive 
poultry-rearing and processing factory 
dealing mainly with ducks and geese.   
This farm has many of its rearing pens 
outside this block.
