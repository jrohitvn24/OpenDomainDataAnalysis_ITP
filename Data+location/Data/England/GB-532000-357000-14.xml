		<title>14Farming in Stickney.</title>
		<content> We visited two different  farms in    
 our area.The first farm was a family  
 farm, owned by Mr. Hooton.Until 60    
 years ago there where no tractors in  
 the area, and then there were only    
 very few of them.Mr Hootons father    
 bought his first tractor about 60     
 years ago. Before that horses were    
 used to plough the field.Mr Hooton    
 still has alot of the old machinery on
 his farm,but he doesn't use it.It is a
 fairly small farm of about 40 acres.A 
 quarter of his farm is grass and three
 quarters of it is arable.The only     
 animals he keeps are cows but he only 
 has eleven of them.He has a 36 foot   
 sprayer and it holds 90 gallons of    
 chemical .The second farm we visted   
 was the farming company.They are a    
 more modern farm than Mr Hooton.It is 
 a far larger farm than Mr Hootons as  
 it has 1300 acres.                    </content>
