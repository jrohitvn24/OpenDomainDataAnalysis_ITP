		<content>    About one quarter of our 12 km     
 block is farmland;enclosed rough      
 grazing grassland used mainly for     
 cows.Some of the land is wet land,    
 lying adjacent to the River Crane,and 
 too wet for use in the Winter months  
 though it is grazed in the Summer.    
    Although we counted 20 farms marked
 in our block on the map,few were still
 in use as farms.Some farm land (eg    
 Hope Cottage Farm,Harkwood Farm etc)  
 has already been built over,farm land 
 at Three Legged Cross is being used   
 for 'pick-your-own'soft fruit.        
    At Kings Farm 82 acres have been   
 set aside for use as a Country Park.A 
 lake for water sports has already been
 excavated,the earth removed being     
 used for land-scaping the area.1300   
 trees have been planted.Rights of way 
 over the land will be preserved.Many  
 sports,including golf,are planned.    </content>
