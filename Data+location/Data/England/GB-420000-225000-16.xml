		<title>16ST NICHOLAS, ODDINGTON</title>
		<content>  The Church of St Nicholas, Oddington,
 stands near the original village site 
 abandoned during the Black Death. A   
 plague pit is thought to exist near   
 the deep, protective ditch partly     
 surrounding the church yard in which  
 there are seven yew trees and a       
 carved tomb of a woman who died in    
 childbirth. On the wall is a stick    
 sundial. Painted on the North wall is 
 a 14th century doom painting showing  
 the Last Judgement with angels and    
 devils. There is a richly carved      
 Jacobean pulpit where a vixen is      
 reputed to have raised her cubs. The  
 Rails and Altar Table are Cromwellian.
 In the doorway are grooves on benches 
 where arrows were sharpened. The      
 oldest parts of the church are the    
 aisle, the chapel and the Norman arch.
 As there is no heating or lighting,   
 the church is only used in summer.    </content>
