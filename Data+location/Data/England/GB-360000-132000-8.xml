		<title>08The hamlet of Sutton</title>
		<content> Our group went to Sutton,when we      
 got there we saw 16 houses 4 made     
 of brick and 12 of stone,also there   
 was 3 farmhouses made of stone with   
 tiled rooves.There were 18            
 farm buildings mostly made of         
 corrageted iron .There was 3 dairy    
 farms,also one telephone box and one  
 victorian post box.Also there was a   
 pathed stone path to Clanville.There  
 were  no shops or pubs or a church.   
 So Sutton is a  Hamlet because it has 
 not a church.
