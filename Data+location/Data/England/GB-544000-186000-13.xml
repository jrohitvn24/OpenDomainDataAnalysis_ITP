		<title>13Religions in Ilford</title>
		<content>   This area of Ilford is blessed with 
{many established religious faiths.}To 
 the north of the D block, are a group 
 of large Anglican and Roman Catholic  
 churches while to the south and west  
 among the more tightly packed terraced
 houses, the churches are smaller and  
 mostly free-church. In the 193O's, the
 influence of a powerful{Jewish        
 community spread in from the north of 
 the block. More recently, since 197O, 
 many{Asian}peoples have moved into the
 cheaper housing around the High Road  
 and have set up their{Hindu, Moslem   
 and{Sikh}centres of worship. A smaller
{West Indian}have successfully joined  
 with{Christian Churches}such as the   
 Baptists. The nearby Loxford High     
 School often stages a very popular    
 "International Evening" in which local
 yet foreign, cultures take a full     
 part. ** B.E.L. Loxford High School.**</content>
