		<title>10Thornby Hall Nr.Guilsborough</title>
		<content>The original Thornby Hall was built in 
the early 17th century.It is built of  
Northamptonshire sandstone with a roof 
of Collyweston tiles. Later in 1923 it 
was greatly extended by the late       
Captain Wills of the tobacco family.It 
then gave employment to house servants 
grooms and gardeners.                  
It is reputed that Oliver Cromwell     
slept there before the battle of Naseby
- this in common with many large houses
in the area.                           
In March 1974 it re-opened as Thornby  
herb garden,but closed in March 1985.  
During this period the building became 
Frimley's Health Centrre.In 1985 the   
property was sold by the Will's family 
and is to be re- open as a home for    
40 deprived children who have been     
taken into the care of the local       
authority.
