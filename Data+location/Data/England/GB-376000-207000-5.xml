 The farm also had 100 pigs and about  
 100 killing birds. Sometimes Mr.      
 Pocket would take animals to market.  
                                       
 They also grew oats, fodder, wheat,   
 barley and potatoes. The oats were    
 taken to Fromebridge Mill to be ground
 in to flour.                          
                                       
 As the Pockets lived on a farm they   
 rarely went in to town but when they  
 did the bus fare was 10p.             
                                       
 Mrs Pocket ended by telling us that
