		<content>  The village of{New Silksworth}dates  
 back to the 1870's when{Lord          
{Londonderry}began work on sinking a   
 new coal mine. A row of terraced      
 cottages was built for the first      
 workers of the mine. By the mid 1870's
{Lord Londonderry}had begun to build a 
 village of mainly single storey       
 terraced cottages to house his miners.
  The village of{New Silksworth}takes  
 it's name from the colliery and many  
 of the streets of old miners' cottages
 were named after members of Lord      
 Londonderry's family, such as{Maria   
{Street}and{Edward Street.             
  After the First World War the village
 grew larger with new streets round the
 old ones. Until 1967 it was part of   
{Durham County}but then it was absorbed
 by the{Borough of Sunderland.
