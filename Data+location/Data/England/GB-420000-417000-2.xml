		<content> Post war homes are built of brick and 
 have a tiled roof.They are usually    
 detached or semi-detached houses or   
 bungalows having a drive to the side  
 and small garden to the front and     
 rear.Most modern homes have external  
 walls of brick and internal ones of   
 "breeze".Many of these houses have    
 some form of central heating.The      
 external skin of these buildings is   
 insulated to prevent heat loss.Modern 
 houses usually have 2 water closets,a 
 large amount of glass and plastic     
 gutters and fallpipes.Houses have hard
 standing for cars and garages or      
 carports.Some more expensive houses   
 are built of stone.These are double   
 glazed and have single and double     
 garages.Inside fitted furniture is    
 found in kitchens and bedrooms.It is  
 common to find houses with utility    
 rooms and en-suite bath/shower rooms. </content>
