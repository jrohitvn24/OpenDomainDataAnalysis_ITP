		<title>01Summary of Our D Block</title>
		<content>                                       
  Our D Block is situated around the   
 St.Ives and St.Leonards area.         
  Our block contains a beautiful forest
 area where tourists and local people  
 enjoy picnics, and leisurely walks.   
  The Ministry Of Defence own a fair   
 sized site,where they test new        
 machinery to make sure it is safe and 
 roadworthy.                           
  Boundary Lane runs through the middle
 of our block.It is called Boundary    
 Lane because it used to be the        
 boundary between Dorset and Hampshire.
 There are a number of houses off      
 Boundary Lane ,along with a large     
 scrap yard.                           
  It is a very pleasant rural area and 
 it is nice to live away from an       
 industrial area.
