		<title>14The W.I. in Barnby Dun 1985</title>
		<content> The W.I. is a happy band,             
 Of village ladies here,               
 Who with many others through the land 
 To their hearts hold the country dear.
 We meet once a month,sun or rain,     
 In the Parish Hall at 7.15.           
 When a speaker will entertain         
 And talk of things they have seen.    
 We have learned how bees make honey,  
 And seen gastronomic delights.        
 Of how to invest all our money,       
 And all about citizen's rights.       
 We fight for our village's welfare,   
 We sometimes don't like what's planned
 We write letters to planners who don't
 Care what becomes of our village land.
 We make teas at fetes to raise money  
 For other less fortunate folk.        
 The W.I. is all about living,         
 Women sharing together good things.   
 Of a community caring and giving      
 And friendship and trust that brings. </content>
