		<title>11EMPLOYMENT IN BURNHAM MARKET</title>
		<content>    A large majority of the people     
 living in this survey area are        
 retired. The area used to be          
 agricultural with much of the         
 population employed on farms, but     
 increasing mechanisation has changed  
 this and there are now only 25 people 
 employed on local farms. Westgate farm
 employs two people on the{Youth       
{Training Scheme}. After the farms, the
 next major employers are the surgery, 
 which employs twelve people, and the  
 garage, which has six employees.      
 Several people from this survey area  
 work in local shops.                  
    King's Lynn and Fakenham are the   
 nearest{industrial centres}and people 
 from Burnham Market commute to work at
 both places.                          
    A mobile{Job Centre}visits the
