		<title>03Householder Survey Results</title>
		<content>   These are the results of a random   
survey of 54 householders within this  
area.                                  
   When asked whether they liked living
in the area,the householders questioned
were overwhelmingly positive about the 
area.Many remarked what a friendly     
place it was and appreciated the       
advantages of living in the country.   
Many also felt it was very convenient  
for getting to larger centres such as  
Oxford or Aylesbury. The only complaint
voiced was that of householders living 
on the A418,who thought there was      
rather too much heavy,noisy traffic.   
   When asked if they would like to    
live in a bigger town over 90% of those
questioned did not want to.            
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
