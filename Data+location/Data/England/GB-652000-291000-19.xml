		<title>19LEISURE IN LOWESTOFT</title>
		<content>                                       
     There are many leisure amenities  
in Lowestoft as it is visited by       
plenty of tourists. On the beach there 
are two piers with amusements and      
cafes. There are bingo halls and small 
fairgrounds nearby as well as hot food 
takeaway shops, restaurants, pubs and  
cafes. In Kensington Gardens there are 
some tennis courts, a bowling green    
and a boating lake.                    
     People often come at weekends     
rather than for a long stay, in fact   
the 3 star Victoria Hotel has recently 
been up for sale and is now used for   
meetings and conferences by business   
people.                                
     Along London Road South there are 
guest houses, hotels and flats. In the 
area there are also youth clubs, night 
clubs and a yacht club.
