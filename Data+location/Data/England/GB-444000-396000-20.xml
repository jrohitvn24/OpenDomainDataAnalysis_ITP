		<title>20KILNHURST HEALTH CENTRE</title>
		<content>   There is one health centre in       
 Kilnhurst.  It was built in 1963 and  
 it is a wood and brick building.      
 There is a shelter for the pushchairs 
 and prams.                            
   The health visitors see about 40    
 babies on Thursday afternoons for     
 weighing, injections and advice.  The 
 Health Centre is also used as a       
 doctor's surgery and ante-natal clinic
 during the week, and as a chiropody   
 clinic once a month.                  
   There are two health visitors, a    
 district nurse, a midwife and a       
 doctor, and a chiropodist visits once 
 a month.  The mothers who take their  
 babies on a Thursday afternoon come   
 from Kilnhurst village, Meadow View   
 area, the Patios and some from Lime   
 Grove.                                
   The mothers can buy milk, rusks and 
 baby food at the clinic.              </content>
