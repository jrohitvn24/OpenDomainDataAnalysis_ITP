		<title>12RETIRED SCHOOL TEACHER</title>
		<content> Has lived at Brancepeth all her life, 
 and has taught at Brancepeth School   
 for 25 years.She likes the countryside
 around Brandon and Brancepeth and     
 hopes that no more houses will be     
 built.When she started school in the  
 village there were only 12 pupils and 
 2 teachers.Brancepeth school soon     
 closed.Even today she sees very few   
 young children in Brancepeth.Those    
 that are young have no facilities. She
 would like to see the cricket field   
 made into a playground.She likes to   
 keep fit playing badminton which she  
 does in the village hall.In her       
 younger days she played for Durham    
 County.Once everybody who lived in    
 Brancepeth knew everybody else and    
 worked on the estate,connected with   
 castle.This has now changed with young
 people moving into the new houses.
