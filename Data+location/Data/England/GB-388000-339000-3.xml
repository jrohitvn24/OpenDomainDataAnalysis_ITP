On the way we saw a swan and a water   
vole, and we also met a person in a    
barge.                                 
The houses next to the canal at Newpark
were built in 1980 and so we talked to 
a friendly person about them.          
Next we joined Trentham Road and found 
that the Esso Garage had been there for
10 years, but in the past 12 months had
become a self-service garage.          
Then we crossed the road and continued 
our walk along Trentham Road. We       
arrived at some big semi-detached      
houses and talked to the people living 
there. They told us that their houses  
were 90 to 100 years old, but they had 
only lived there for 1.5 years. Next   
door to them at 236 Trentham Road there
were stables at the back of the house, 
but they are now used as garages
