		<content> The main occupation is farming.  The  
 majority of the land is owned by four 
 farms;  Tannerswhite (Norwood End)    
 owned by Tom East, Butt Hatch         
 (Beauchamp Roding) owned by Mr. Read, 
 Ponders Lodge (Fyfield) owned by Miss 
 Boyton, Warders Hall(Willingale) owned
 by Mr. Stock.   Of the four farmers   
 Mr.Read farms the most.   All four are
 highly mechanised, grow cereal (wheat 
 and barley), rape, peas and potatoes; 
 they keep sheep, pigs, cattle and     
 chickens.   The high mechanisation has
 brought about the biggest change.   A 
 freak storm on Sunday, May 26 caused  
 serious damage to the crops ofthree   
 farms,mainly the rape and barley - the
 barley having to be turned            
 into silage.   The path of devastation
 followed a clear line across the area.
