		<title>10Peoples Attitudes</title>
		<content> A short questionnaire was sent to most
 households, about 75% returned it. Of 
 these, 100% were happy living here,   
 and 100% were optimistic for the      
 future for themselves. A few worried  
 about the future for their children   
 and grandchildren. Worries recorded   
 were about the increasing amount of   
 violence, danger of nuclear war,      
 general lowering of standards, lack of
 employment for the young. When asked  
 "Is there anything in the area that   
 disturbs you, and if so what would you
 like done about it?"; most said "No". 
 A few complained about excessive      
 numbers of military low flying        
 aircraft. 1 worried about locals      
 leaving to be replaced by weekenders. 
 1 complained about lack of cheap rural
 bus service. Every household has at   
 least 1 car.                          
                                       </content>
