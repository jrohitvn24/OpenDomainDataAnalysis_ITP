		<content>    Two housing estates have been built
 within the block, specifically to     
 accommodate R.A.F. families, besides  
 those houses built within the         
 boundaries of the base itself.   The  
 number of R.A.F. personell serving on 
 the base has been reduced considerably
 over the last ten years.   As a       
 result, the two R.A.F. quarters within
 the village have been sold to private 
 ownership.   Some of these houses have
 been sold to Forces families, others  
 have been occupied by people working  
 in the surrounding area.   The village
 has, therefore, tended to become a    
 dormitory village for the nearby towns
 of Dereham (4miles) and Norwich (15   
 miles).                               
                                       
     There is no single, major source  
 of employment within the area, after  
 that of the R.A.F. camp.              </content>
