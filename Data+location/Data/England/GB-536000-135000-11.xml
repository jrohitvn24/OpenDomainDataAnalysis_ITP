		<content> This area consists of roughly 90% open
 countryside, the remainder being the  
 builtup area of the south west        
 quadrant of the town. The countryside 
 is medium quality farmland.It is      
 attractive, being part of the High    
 Weald area of outstanding natural     
 beauty and includes the National Trust
 house &amp; gardens at Standen. The       
 builtup area is mostly modern housing 
 estates but includes the older        
 properties along Ship St &amp; Dunnings   
 Rd and ,most importantly, the ancient 
 &amp; picturesque High St (qv). The town  
 has a rail link to London &amp; many of   
 its residents are commuters. Bus      
 services to and from the High St are  
 alsom fairly comprehensive. It is a   
 wealthy area in general, umemployment 
 is low, and home ownership the        
 norm.The people are insulated from    
 economic &amp; environmental hardship.    </content>
