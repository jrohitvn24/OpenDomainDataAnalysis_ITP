		<title>12GRAYS BEACH</title>
		<content>  In Grays, on the river bank by the   
 Thames, a small park can be seen. This
 area is known locally as Grays Beach. 
 The park has hardly any facilities.   
 The boating pool is full of stones and
 slime. A paddling pool is no longer in
 use. Some facilities in the park are  
 swings, climbing frame and see-saw.   
  A pier is near the yacht club, where 
 men sometimes fish. By the pier a     
 grating can be seen. The river bank is
 dirty and dull. Wood is scattered     
 everywhere. Plastic bottles and       
 smashed glass stop people enjoying    
 themselves.                           
  Adjoining Grays Beach is a public    
 open space called{KILVERT'S FIELD.}   
 This playing field serves a nearby    
 housing estate. Each year a funfair   
 visits the field to the delight of the
 local children.
