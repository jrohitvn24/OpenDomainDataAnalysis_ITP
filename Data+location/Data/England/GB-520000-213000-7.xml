		<title>07SHOPS IN WELWYN GARDEN CITY</title>
		<content> Welwyn Garden City was the second     
 Garden City in England.  It was one of
 the first planned towns to be         
 constructed after the First World War 
 and was designed by Ebenezer Howard.  
 As Welwyn Garden City is a modern town
 there are many facilities for         
 everyone, old or young.  In each small
 community or "neighbourhood" in Welwyn
 Garden City there are activities going
 on during the week.  The town centre  
 has various shops ranging from food to
 clothes.  The main store in Welwyn    
 Garden is John Lewis;  this has       
 recently opened following the closure 
 of Welwyn Department Store.  John     
 Lewis has a wide range of departments 
 in itself, from household goods to a  
 small chemist.  There is also a cafe, 
 men's hairdressers and a travel agent 
 in John Lewis.                        
                                       </content>
