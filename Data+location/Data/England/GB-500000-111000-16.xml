		<title>16HISTORIC HOUSES BURY/H'TON 2</title>
		<content> There are many other old houses, the  
 oldest being Bury Church which was    
 probably started in the latter part of
 the 12th Century. Houghton church is  
 also a very old building started circa
 late 12th Century.                    
 The 3 inns are all over 400 years old,
 the White Horse and the Black Dog and 
 Duck both in Bury; and the George and 
 Dragon in Houghton which sheltered    
 Charles II from Cromwell's soldiers.  
 The 2 farmhouses in houghton are also 
 very old, one dating back to the 14th 
 Century  whilst the other was built in
 the 16th Century. Additionaly, there  
 are some dozen or so other houses in  
 Bury privately owned dating back to   
 the 16th Century, including 4 listed  
 buildings and a few of like vintage in
 Houghton. Many of these houses are    
 built of flint stones and some being  
 still thatched.                       </content>
