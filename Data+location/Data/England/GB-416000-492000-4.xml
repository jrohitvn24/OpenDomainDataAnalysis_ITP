		<title>04Former days at Hauxwell</title>
		<content>   My home was in South Shields, but in
 August 1923 I got work as housemaid to
 Colonel Wade-Dalton at Hauxwell Hall.A
 train ran to Constable Burton in those
 days. I was met by a horse and trap. I
 remember the road to Hunton was a cart
 track with deep ruts in the middle!   
  Hauxwell was really feudal. Everybody
 in the village worked on the estate so
 it was  self-supporting. Each  cottage
 had an acre  and a  cow. Churning days
 were anxious days then,  especially if
 the butter would not come. It was sold
 at Leyburn  or shaped into dainty pats
 for  shows.  The Colonel always gave a
 New Year party at the hall for workers
 and wives.  We  made our own pleasures
 mostly;whist drives,dances or concerts
 in school. The Reading Room and quoits
 were for MEN ONLY.  Once a German band
 came here with a dancing bear! Village
 life changed when the war started.    </content>
