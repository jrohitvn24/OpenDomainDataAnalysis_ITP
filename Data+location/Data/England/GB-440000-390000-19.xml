		<title>19TRANSPORT EXECUTIVE</title>
		<content> April 1974 saw the formation of the   
 South Yorkshire Passenger Transport   
 Executive, from the former Rotherham ,
 Sheffield and Doncaster municiple     
 transport departments. Early in 1977  
 the executive decided that it would be
 necessary to expand the Rotherham     
 fleet during the next ten years.The   
 depot already in use at Rawmarsh, was 
 then seventy years old, and the       
 decision was taken to build a new     
 depot alongside Midland Road in       
 Masbrough. In total, the buildings    
 cover 20,837 square metres, mainly in 
 two blocks. One contains the main     
 garage,workshops,offices and canteen, 
 the other contains the support        
 services. There is room inside the    
 garage to park up to 200 buses.There  
 are two cleaning areas, one where     
 buses are washed every day, the other 
 every week.                           </content>
