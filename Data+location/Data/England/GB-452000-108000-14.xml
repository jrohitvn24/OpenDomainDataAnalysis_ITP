		<content> We interviewed Anna Beardshaw on "Life
 Styles".  She is l4 years old and     
 lives near Cold Harbour Farm in       
 Wickham.  She has a brother, one dog  
 and two cats.  She goes to Wykeham    
 House School in Fareham.              
     Anna gets up at 7.30 a.m. on      
 school days, 8.30 on Saturdays        
 (because of tennis) and 9.30 a.m. on  
 Sundays.  On school days Anna goes to 
 bed at l0.30 p.m.  Other days she goes
 to bed at midnight.                   
    She has breakfast every morning and
 eats her evening meal at 6.30 p.m.  In
 yhe evenings she watches television,  
 plays tennis, does her homework or    
 goes swimming, and at the weekends she
 may go to a disco or a party.  Anna   
 finds that there is not really at lot 
 to do in her area in the evening.
