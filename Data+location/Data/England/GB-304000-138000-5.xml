		<content>      The{Church}consists of chancel,  
 nave, north and south aisles of three 
 bays, with a bell gable at the west   
 end and a small porch.   The whole of 
 the northern portion, the south       
 chancel aisle and all the roofs are   
 modern.   The east wall of the chancel
 is ancient up to the spring of the    
 arch of the window, so is the south   
 side of the chancel.                  
      The{south aisle}is said to have  
 been built in 1806, but the{mediaeval 
{windows were re-used.  }There are     
 three in the south wall, square       
 headed, each of two ogee-headed lights
 cinquefoiled, the two eastmost having 
 trefoiled tracery lights.             
      The{arcade}has thick circular    
 piers, narrow moulded capitals, no    
 bases, and pointed arches of low      
 pitch chamfered.   It is said to date 
 from 1806.                            </content>
