		<content>  {Historic buildings}play an important
 part in Dartmouth in 1985, as an      
 attraction to tourists as well as     
 serving the commercial life of the    
 town.                                 
   Two churches date back from the 12th
 century.{St. Clement's}was mother     
 church to{St. Saviour's}but the latter
 has assumed greater importance because
 it is more central.                   
  {Agincourt House,}now an antique     
 shop, was once a 14th century         
 merchant's house.                     
    One of Dartmouth's public houses,  
{"The Cherub",}was originally a 14th   
 century dwelling whose timbers have   
 been exposed fairly recently.         
   When they enter Batterbees, a local 
 hardware and electrical shop,         
 customers can see the original        
 staircase and fine plasterwork of the 
 18th century{"Mansion House".         </content>
