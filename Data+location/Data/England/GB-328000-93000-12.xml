		<title>12     Bruckland farm</title>
		<content> The farm house is very old and used to
 be part of Rousden Estate. They made a
 few fields larger by pulling up       
 hedges.Edge Hill was called Edge Hill 
 because it is the of a hill.          
   The farmhouse is about 400 years    
 old.There is a new shed and parlour   
 and a new beef unit this year.Most of 
 the buildings are as old as the       
 farmhouse.                            
    They use the buildings for cows and
 for stock.The breeds of cows the farm 
 has are Friesians and Ayrshines.      
    The cows are milked at the same    
 time.                                 
    Some of the cows go to the cattle  
 market to be sold.                    
    The breeds of pigs the farm has got
 are the Saddleback and Londrace.There 
 are pet pigs for family pigs.
