		<title>13LIFE FOR A GIRL AGED 11</title>
		<content> Sacha, an 11 year old girl, lives with
 her parents and 16 year old brother in
 an unusually large house, called      
 Pyebirch Manor.   She gets up at      
 6.30am for a breakfast of toast and   
 jam.  Her mother is on a rota of      
 parents who transport their children  
 to Stafford schools.  Sacha attends an
 Independent preparatory school.  Her  
 favourite subjects are French and     
 Geography.  At home Sacha sometimes   
 works in the garden for her pocket    
 money:  70 pence a week.  She does her
 music practice (harp and flute) and   
 homework and helps with the dinner.   
 Her favourite meal is sausages, baked 
 beans and mashed potatoes.  To relax  
 Sacha watches television - her        
 favourite programmes are the soap     
 operas, Dallas and Dynasty.  She      
 enjoys pop music, especially the group
 Frankie goes to Hollywood.            </content>
