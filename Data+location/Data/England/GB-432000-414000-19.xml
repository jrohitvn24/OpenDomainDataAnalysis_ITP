		<title>19An Eyesore or Amenity</title>
		<content>   To the south of our area and running
 from south-east to north-west is a    
 disused railway running through       
 cuttings or on embankments but rarely 
 at ground level.                      
  It is often used by walkers in the   
 area since being surrounded by woods  
 and fields it can be very pleasant.   
 Some may say that a dismantled railway
 line is a potential eyesore but is    
 this always the case?                 
  When it was first closed the cuttings
 provided ideal sites for people who   
 wanted to tip their rubbish.  Now most
 of it is cleaned up and wild plants,  
 birds and animals are taking control. 
  Some plants which have been killed by
 chemicals used on farms can be found, 
 one example is the poppy. Foxes are   
 here too heading for the woods at     
 night in search of food.
