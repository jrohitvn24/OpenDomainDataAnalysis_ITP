		<title>04HOUSING IN LAWRENCE WESTON</title>
		<content> Before 1948, there were only{fields   
 and{woodland}in Lawrence Weston.      
 Bristol needed more homes, so the     
 Council decided to build a new housing
 estate. It was built with families in 
 mind. All the houses have{gardens}and 
 the flats have grassed areas around   
 them. Most{houses}have 3 bedrooms, 2  
 reception rooms, kitchen and bathroom,
 and most{flats}have 2 bedrooms, living
 room, kitchen and bathroom.{Garages   
 were built in blocks away from the    
 houses as few people had cars. The    
{Council owned}all the homes, but some 
 tenants have bought theirs. Recently  
 many{private houses}with garages have 
 been constructed, with between 1 and 4
 bedrooms. Some owner-occupiers have   
 had{extensions}built and/or renewed   
 their{windows and doors}with aluminium
 or UPVC.            Weston Park School
