		<content>  There are 60+ houses in this village.
We gave out 50 questionaires and got 30
replies. Few villagers felt they were  
accepted until they had lived there for
at least 10 years. In our survey we    
found  60%&lt;8 20%&lt;20 and 20%>20 yrs old.
  This changing population is untypical
of rural villages and shows Piddinghoe 
becoming more of a dormitory. This is  
confirmed by the high mobility of the  
residents: 26/30 having cars. Most of  
those in work have to travel outside   
the village, many in professional or   
academic roles in Brighton or Lewes.   
  New building is restricted but there 
has has been concentrated in-filling   
and development. The traditional social
events are continued but it is hard to 
maintain the old idea of a village when
there is no shop. The village is felt  
to occupy a pleasant position but has  
lost its heart.                        </content>
