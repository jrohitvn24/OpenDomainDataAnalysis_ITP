     Drakes Broughton was first a      
{village school,}then a first and a    
 Middle School separately, but now they
 have been joined together. The present
 school was started to be built in     
 1974.It was opened by the Bishop of   
 Worcester. There was a first school   
 before, which was in{1865.}There were 
 only two classes. The head used to    
 write a diary called a log book and   
 they found one which said that        
 once they had{"six feet of snow".}The 
 first school built in Drakes Broughton
 was one of the first schools in the   
 country. There used to be a bell on   
 top of the old school building. The   
 rest was built in the 1960's. The old 
 school was finished in 1867. First of 
 all they had to have mobile           
 classrooms.
