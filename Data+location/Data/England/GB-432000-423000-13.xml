		<content> THE TEXTILE INDUSTRY IN LANCASHIRE AND
 YORKSHIRE HAS CAUSED POLLUTION OVER   
 THE LAST TWO CENTURIES.SMOKE FROM     
 MILLS IN LANCASHIRE,CARRIED OVER THE  
 PENNINES BY THE PREVAILING WESTERLY   
 WIND, ADDED TO SMOKE FROM WEST RIDING 
 WOOLEN MILLS, HAS BLACKENED MANY      
 BUILDINGS ERECTED DURING VICTORIAN    
 TIMES OR EARLIER ESPECIALLY WHERE     
 SANDSTONE OR LIMESTONE HAS BEEN USED. 
 THE CLEAN AIR ACT HAS REDUCED THIS AND
 SCRUBBING WITH A CAUSTIC SOLUTION HAS 
 RESTORED THE ORIGINAL TEXTURE.SOOT    
 KILLED FRUIT TREES BUT SUITED RHUBARB 
 SO THAT WAKEFIELD BECAME THE MAIN     
 GROWING AREA IN THE U.K. THIS IS NOW  
 DECLINING.DYE FROM TEXTILE MILLS      
 UPSTREAM MADE THE CALDER THE MOST     
 POLLUTED OF ALL RIVERS BUT THE DECLINE
 IN TEXTILE MANUFACTURE HAS EASED      
 MATTERS AND FISH HAVE REAPPEARED AT   
 STANLEY FERRY.                        </content>
