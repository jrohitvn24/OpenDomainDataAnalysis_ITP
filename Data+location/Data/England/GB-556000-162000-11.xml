		<title>11Planning - What is a farm?</title>
		<content> In{Ash}the local planning authority,  
{Sevenoaks District Council}have tried 
 to enforce a policy that any new      
 development must be linked directly to
 employment on the land.  This has led 
 to a couple of decisions that         
 independently seem sound, but taken   
 together show some strange contrasts. 
                                       
 For a{nursery cum garden centre       
{permission}was{granted}for an         
{agricultural labourer's cottage.} An  
 elaborate mock oast-house was built.  
                                       
 A few yards away is a{farm with retail
{outlet}which also has a{tropical fish 
{shop}in small premises, modelled on a 
 domestic dwelling, set back and out of
 site from the road.  This (the fish   
 shop) the{planning authority}have     
{objected}to and have served an        
{enforcement notice.                   </content>
