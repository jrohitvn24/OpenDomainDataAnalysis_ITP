		<title>07The Manor House, Hilmarton.</title>
		<content> Hilmarton Manor, which was built in   
 1820, is a very large house. It has   
 eight bedrooms and three bathrooms    
 upstairs.Downstairs it has a library, 
 an office,a dining room, a kitchen and
 three other rooms. The Manor still has
 some elm floorboards and in one room  
 it even has the original flagstones.  
 Mr-Baile-De-Laperriere who owns the   
 house runs a book company at the      
 manor.He owns four acres including his
 garden.In the garden there are said to
 be the ghosts of three cavaliers that 
 roam the garden and have been seen on 
 a couple of occasions. In the gardens 
 there is a large greenhouse, a walled 
 garden and a paddock. In one part of  
 the garden they used to have a tennis 
 court and the outline still shows     
 today. On the house is a balcony which
 overlooks where the tennis court was. 
 There is also a stone built grotto.   </content>
