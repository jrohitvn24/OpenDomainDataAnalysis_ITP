		<content>     Much of the area owned by the     
 Welbeck Estate Company is dominated by
 woodland. This woodland is used for   
 felling.                              
     The timber felling process takes  
 place under the 'Basis Two Dedication 
 Plan.' This means that the W.E.C. must
 state their plans for the next five   
 years to the local council for its    
 approval.                             
     The trees are allowed to grow for 
 22 years after planting before they   
 are cut down. This is done in a series
 of 3 five_yearly thinnings. In the    
 first thinning every third row of     
 trees is cut down, for the second     
 thinning every other row is removed   
 and for the third (37 years after     
 planting) all the remaining trees are 
 removed. After 50 years the plantation
 is replaced , giving the soil 13 years
 to recover.                           </content>
