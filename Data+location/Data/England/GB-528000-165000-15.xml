		<content>    Many of Croydon's churches were    
built in the Victorian era. In the last
ten years some of the largest churches 
have fallen into disrepair, and because
of small congregations, they have been 
closed.  A few churches have opened    
their doors to welcome other religions 
- one church has a regular Sikh        
meeting.  The Established Church may   
have declined, but other religions     
and beliefs have developed.            
     Sutton has a wide variety of      
churches, both old and new. St.Mary's  
Parish Church,Beddington dates back to 
the Carew family of the 16th century;  
All Saints,Carshalton has an equally   
long history while by contrast, the    
Baptist Free at Carshalton Beeches is  
relatively modern.Although the respect-
ive denominations are closely defined  
within Sutton, there is a considerable 
amount of ecumenical activity.         </content>
