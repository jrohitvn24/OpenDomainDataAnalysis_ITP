		<title>17INDUSTRY IN HOLYBOURNE</title>
		<content> When we visited Holybourne we were    
 shown round the Watson and Haig site, 
 where {agricultural machinery} is     
 repaired and resold.  The machines    
 range from tractors to fork lifts.  We
 saw large and small tractors, plough  
 and other attachments for tractors,   
 combine harvesters and a 'giraffe' for
 silage making.  We were shown all     
 round the site and allowed to climb up
 on some of the tractors. We watched   
 machinery being repaired in the       
 workshop and we were shown the store  
 of {spare parts} they have to keep.   
 They have an {office} attached to the 
 workshop and a computer to help with  
 their administration.                 
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
