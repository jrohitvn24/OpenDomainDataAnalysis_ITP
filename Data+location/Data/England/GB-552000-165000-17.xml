		<content>Anthony Roper died in 1599 but left    
property and money for the benifit of  
the people of our community for all    
time. His name was chosen for our      
school as a link between the two       
communities which the school mainly    
serves,Farningham and Eynsford. The    
school badge has a stags head part of  
the coat of arms of the Roper family.  
We have this on our school T-shirt .   
Every junior leaving for secondary     
school is presented with a bible by the
trustees of Ropers Charity. We are     
reminded of him every day. Wadard was  
a Norman knight in the centre of a     
scene from the Bayeux Tapestry who was 
Sub-tenant of the manor of Farningham. 
The villagers still remember him. Many 
have T-shirts with his motif-it also   
appears as a weather vane motif on the 
villagehall.
