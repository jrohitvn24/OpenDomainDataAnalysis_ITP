		<title>17    School Activities</title>
		<content> At Fifth Avenue Junior High we have a 
 wide range of activities. Every lunch 
 time the library is open for girls to 
 borrow books or to read.  The computer
 room is also open most lunch times.   
 There is an athleics club on two lunch
 times, one for 9-11 years and the     
 other for 11-13 years.  The 9-11's    
 also have a gardening club and a      
 junior choir.  The 11-13's have a     
 senior choir, an art club and keep    
 fit.  The top year also have a        
 badminton club and a science club.  I 
 have made a wooden toy and done some  
 glassblowing as well as working in the
 garden this year.                     
 Last year I was in{"Joseph and the    
{Amazing Technicolour Dreamcoat".} This
 was a musical show which we thought   
 was fantastic.
