		<title>02DUXMORE FARM</title>
		<content>    Duxmore farm is situated 2 miles   
 south of Havenstreet, and 5 miles east
 of Newport.  It is owned by           
 Mr.Kennerly who is not an Islander,   
 but was born in Canada.  As far back  
 as he can remember farming has been in
 his family.  His wife and children    
 help him with the farm chores.  The   
 farmhouse is two cottages and was     
 built in 1880.                        
    He owns 300 acres of land, and     
 grows wheat and barley.  He has 90    
 milking cows which are Fresians and   
 150 beef and young dairy cattle.  He  
 prouces milk, beef, wheat and barley. 
 He makes use of the surrounding       
 woodland, making wooden stakes from   
 oak trees.                            
    He enjoys working on hot days, but 
 not when it's wet and cold.           
 He has two farm helpers and a         
 milkmaid.                             </content>
