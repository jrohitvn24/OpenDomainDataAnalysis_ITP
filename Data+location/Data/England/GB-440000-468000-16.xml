		<title>16THE NEW ARRIVALS</title>
		<content> We  interviewed  eight  people  who   
 had  not  been  brought  up  in  the  
 village .Most of them had moved here  
 in the last two years, the most recent
 arrived two  months ago.They come from
 all over  Britain, Scotland, Wales,   
 Gloucester, Durham, Bedford and others
 parts of Yorkshire.One of them runs a 
 business in the village but others    
 wanted to be near to where they       
 worked,Leeds for example, which is    
 thirty miles away.Everyone liked the  
 country side ,the people here are     
 friendly.The new houses are popular   
 and the school is near. S ome people  
 chose to retire here. The people we   
 interviewed were pleased with their   
 new life.  The elderly newcomers find 
 it peaceful and quiet.
