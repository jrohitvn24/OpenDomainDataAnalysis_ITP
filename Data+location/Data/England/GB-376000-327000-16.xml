3 problems concern people:- World      
peace, their children's future, and    
economic and social problems. Most     
residents mention peace. They dislike  
the existence of atomic bombs, agree   
that they have been a deterrent, but   
believe that multilateral disarmament  
is necessary. Some fear the bomb being 
in irresponsible hands. Parents hope   
their children will be happy and       
employed. Economic and social problems 
which worry peope are unemployment;    
the future of the welfare state; lack  
of discipline and drug problems among  
youth; increase in crimes of violence; 
child abuse; racial problems;          
pollution of the environment.          
Some do not think about the future.    
Rural peace appeals to residents.      
                                       
                                       </content>
