		<content>  Class 2 wrote a questionaire about   
 housing which they took home for their
 parents to fill in.We used the        
 computer to work out the averages of  
 some of our imformation.Here are some 
 of our results.The average number of  
{people in our homes}was 4.4,and the   
 average number of{rooms}in the house  
 was 8.7. In our houses the average    
 number of{windows}was 12.4.Most of our
 homes are built of{brick.}3 of the 23 
 in our survey are built of{wattle and 
{daub}and one of{stone.}Most of the    
 houses were{heated}by coke or coal,a  
 few by wood fires and electricity , 4 
 by oil and 2 by calor gas.Ombersley   
 does not have mains gas but calor gas 
 can be delivered by a lorry .Many     
 houses in Ombersley are old,we found  
 that the{average age}of our houses was
 121 years.
