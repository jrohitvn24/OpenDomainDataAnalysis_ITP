           {and By Ronald Bischof      
 One afternoon we went from school to  
 visit Northgate Library.We were going 
 to find out which names were most     
 common on the Headland,where some     
 families have lived for generations.  
 This  is what we discovered when we   
 looked through the Electors Roll.     
{Kennedy-26 adults,Boagey-24 adults,   
{Snowdon-17 adults,Pounder-15 adults,  
{Horsley-13 adults,Maiden-9 adults,    
{Skinner-5 adults.                     
 Ronnie Bischof discovered that his mum
 and dad were the only ones with that  
 name in the whole North-Eastern area. 
 That is probably because his          
 grandfather came from Germany to      
 settle in Britain.                    
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
