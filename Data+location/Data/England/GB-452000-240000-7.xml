		<title>07St Lawrence Church, Marston</title>
		<content> The local history of the church dates 
 the building back to the Norman era.  
 The local stone used to build the     
 church was likely to have been dug out
 of a quarry in a field to the south of
 the church.We discovered the large dip
 in the field today.                   
 The building is in a very good state  
 of repair and we discovered that the  
 church underwent restoration in 1969  
 when the tower was strengthened.This  
 strengthening has enabled the bells to
 be rung and has made a great          
 improvement to the church building.   
 There is a private drive connecting   
 the church with Marston House. The    
 importance of this house and its      
 occupants is still evident in the     
 amount of land owned by Marston Estate
 and by the beautiful grounds.
