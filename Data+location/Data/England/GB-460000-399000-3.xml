		<title>03Cantley in the Past.</title>
		<content>{Cantley}was an important area to the  
{Romans}because of the pottery kilns   
 which were sited in the area.The      
 remains of many kilns have been       
 discovered and pieces of pottery can  
 still be found in gardens today.      
 The{Saxons}settled in the area under  
 the leadership of a chief called      
 Canta.Their settlement was in a       
 clearing and the small village which  
 developed became known as{Cantaleia.  
 This was mentioned in the original    
 Domesday Book with Bessacarr being    
 referred to as a marshy stretch of    
 land.St.Wilfred's church is one of the
 oldest in the Doncaster area being    
 built originally of wood and thatch   
 before the{Normans}invasion.Later this
 was replaced by a stone church however
 the present building dates from the   
 beginning of this century.
