		<content>   The following information was       
 obtained from Mr. George Starkie an   
 old inhabitant of{Newhey.}            
   Up to the inter-war period most of  
 the streets in Newhey were cobbled.   
 Trams ran from Newhey into Rochdale   
 town centre. Mr. Starkie's earliest   
 recollections are when the most common
 forms of transport were horse-drawn.  
   There has been little change in the 
 number of shops in Newhey since 1923  
 but in many cases owners and the type 
 of trade carried out have changed.    
   The roads on the estate near Newhey 
 County Primary School were built by   
 German prisoners of war during World  
 War Two.
