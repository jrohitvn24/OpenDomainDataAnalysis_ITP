		<content>4.Green's Meadow, a recreational site  
owned by Mid-Suffolk District Council, 
is based on a landscaped rubbish-tip.  
5.There is a peaty area in the bottom  
of the valley-which is why the railway 
embankment was floated on hazel        
faggots.                               
6.Some flower-rich meadows in the      
Gipping valley will eventually become  
the property of the Museum of East     
Anglian Life.                          
7.A large, good specimen of the native 
black poplar is growing in Mill Street.
8.The pond off Gainsborough Rd         
currently has Great Crested Newts, a   
protected species.                     
9.A planned walk along the Gipping     
valley starts in Stowmarket-testimony  
to the interest shown by some of the   
population in their environment.
