 St Joseph's Monastery is on Lawrence  
 Street.The Poor Clare nuns never leave
 the monastery.Only one nun is allowed 
 to leave the building to go out       
 shopping.A monastery is where monks or
 nuns live in a big house with an      
 enclosed garden.They make a vow of    
 poverty so that they have no          
 possesions.They tie their habits with 
 a cord and tie three knots in it to   
 stand for the three vows that they    
 take.In the Monastery there are twenty
 or more nuns.The nuns wear Brown and  
 White habits.Mother Superior must be  
 obeyed by all the nuns. She makes     
 all the decisions about the day to day
 running of the monastery.The nuns feed
 tramps with soup and bread.The nuns   
 are vegetarians.They make altarbread  
 and sew vestments.                    </content>
