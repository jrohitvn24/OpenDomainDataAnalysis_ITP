 building on the A40,the Nursery Class 
 is moving to new premises (at the     
 First School) this September.         
      Bright friezes &amp; an egg_shell    
 collage,Humpty Dumpty, decorate the   
 walls.At 9.30.am in a happy relaxed   
 atmosphere,40 children are being      
 taught by 3 staff.Rising 5's are busy 
 sorting colours &amp; counting.Younger 4's
 do directed activities{junk modelling,
{sand &amp; water play, home_corner,}&amp;     
 books.Each activity has it's own area.
 Sweet_making is the special activity  
 today.                                
       After "apple time" the children 
 choose freely &amp; may go outside to play
 with large toys:_a boat,trains &amp;      
 bikes.The sand pit is popular in fine 
 weather.A different group of 40       
 children attends in the afternoon.
