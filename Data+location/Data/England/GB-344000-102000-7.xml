		<title>07WILD BIRDS</title>
		<content>  Birds in Dorset are mostly garden    
 birds but the woods are filled with   
 gamebirds and crows.Crows and hawks   
 are a threat to farming as they eat   
 seeds and take lambs,a kestrel is the 
 farmers ally because it kills         
 mice,shrews and rats that infest corn 
 supplies and other stacks of          
 food.Gamebirds are shot for meat,sport
 and sometimes to protect the crops    
 like beans,peas etc.for pheasants and 
 partridge eat corn,wheat etc.Crows are
 shot for ruining seeded               
 fields.Although big hawks take sheep  
 there is a law against shooting them  
 and as with the deer there can be a   
 heavy fine if a dead bird of prey is  
 found on your land.Kestrels and owls  
 kill vermin and other pests,barn owls 
 nest in high rafters of barns while   
 tawny+little owls spend the day on    
 telephone wires and the night hunting.</content>
