		<title>16Farming in Halewood.</title>
		<content>   The vast majority of the land in our
 survey area is farmland. In fact ten  
 of our twelve kilometre squares have  
 farming as the primary land cover. Of 
 these nine are devoted to crops, these
 crops being barley, corn, hay, oilseed
 and rape. There is also some potato   
 production and a very small percentage
 of land given over to dairy cattle.   
 The farms in the area are as follows: 
        Foxhill Farm                   
        Spring Farm                    
        Springfield Farm               
        Plumpton's Farm                
        Cross Hillocks Farm            
        Tray Ashes Farm                
        Boscoe Hall Farm               
        Brook House Farm               
        Ditton Fold Farm               
   Many of the families who originally 
 ran and owned the farms have now been 
 replaced by new families.             </content>
