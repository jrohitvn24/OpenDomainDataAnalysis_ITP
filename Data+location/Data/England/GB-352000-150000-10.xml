		<title>10PRIDDY SCHOOL</title>
		<content> At the centre of the village can be   
 found the village school. Built next  
 to the church, it is on raised ground 
 with good views of the village and the
 surrounding countryside.              
 Only 40 children attend the school and
 they are divided into 2 classes       
 infants and juniors. There are        
 2 full time teachers and 1 part time. 
 When it is time to go to secondary    
 school most children go to the Blue   
 School in Wells.                      
 There are many small schools like this
 one in Somerset  and because Priddy is
 so far away from the nearest  town it 
 will stay open even though the number 
 of children has been falling steadily 
 over the last few years.
