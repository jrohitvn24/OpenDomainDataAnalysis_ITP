There are three full time teachers and a part-time non-teaching Head Teacher. Each class is supported by a part-time teaching assistant. The school has two part-time administrators, two mid-day supervisors, a school cook and a caretaker/cleaner. In 2011 the kitchen was upgraded to a fully functioning commercial kitchen which prepares approximately thirty meals per day. the school recently(August 2010) acquired the use of an area of adjacent woodland from NYCC (Highways) and is now using this as an outdoor learning resource. There is an active PTA and a dedicated Governing Body. Ofsted judged the school to be good with some outstanding features in 2011. At the time of writing the Governors are planning to extend the school in 2012 to replace the thirty seven year old temporary classroom. The majority of the children continue their education at King James's School (Specialist Technology College) Knaresborough.   &lt;br />
