 The cost of housing in Saffron Walden 
 is high. This is for two reasons.     
 Firstly Saffron Walden is a pleasant  
 place to live. Many people work in    
 London but don't want to live there.  
 It is easy to travel in by train so   
 they move out to live in the          
 countryside. They earn high salaries  
 and this has tended to move the prices
 upwards.                              
 Secondly there is an odd mix of       
 housing. On the new estates there are 
 a lot of small houses with 2 or 3     
 bedrooms and a lounge diner. There are
 a lot of larger older properties. But 
 there is a shortage of medium sized 3 
 and 4 bedroomed houses. A house like  
 that will cost about Â£65,000. This is 
 Â£8-10,000 more than a year ago.
