		<content>      Lilly of the Valley and Orchids  
 are still to be found in Goosehill    
 Woods. Many rare butterflies breed in 
 the area. The most notable place for  
 these being Trench Wood, where        
 nightingales are often heard singing  
 during the summer months.             
      The area has a considerable      
 number of footpaths, many of which are
 obstructed but a conserted effort to  
 clear at least some of the major paths
 is now being made under a scheme known
 as the Higherarchy Scheme.            
      The main footpath is the Wychavon
 Way which passes through the area on  
 its route from Holt Fleet to          
 Winchcombe. This footpath is 42 miles 
 long.
