		<content> Two small villages east and west of   
 the Sleaford/Bourne road. Aswarby is  
 an estate village on the east side of 
 Aswarby Park, an area of grass and    
 scattered trees. Daffodils are        
 naturalised in some areas and sheep   
 and cattle graze. Swarby has few new  
 houses. The population of both        
 villages are probably half land       
 workers, the remainder commute to     
 Sleaford or Grantham. The land is     
 divided by thorn hedges into medium   
 sized fields growing cereals,         
 potatoes, sugar beet and oil seed     
 rape. There are isolated grass fields 
 and small woods. A daily bus service  
 links swarby with Sleaford and        
 Grantham. A bus also runs on the main 
 road between Sleaford and Bourne. But 
 without private transport villagers   
 are somewhat isolated. The public     
 house in square 10 serves both        </content>
