		<title>18How villages have changed</title>
		<content>  We looked at some Census Returns from
 1881 to see how peoples's jobs in the 
 village have changed in the last      
 hundred years.                        
  In 1881 nearly a half of the people  
 in the village with jobs were         
 agricultural labourers, working on the
 land: the next largest number was     
 servants, like maids, cooks, domestic 
 servants, governesses and             
 housekeepers. There were also         
 carpenters, bakers, shoemakers,       
 butchers, farmers, blacksmiths, masons
 and even a magistrate.                
                                       
  Now there are not that many people   
 who actually work in the village.     
 There are some farms, the school, the 
 pub, the Church and the Post Office.  
 Even I work in the village!
