		<title>07FARMING IN FOUR LANES.</title>
		<content>  Dairy farming is easily the most     
 common type of farming in the         
 district. The Fresian cow being the   
 popular choice. Some intensive        
 management of grassland is done but   
 the majority is cut for hay and       
 silage. Beef cattle is the next       
 frequent the Hereford-cross is reared 
 and sent to cattle markets in Redruth 
 and Camborne.                         
 Milk is collected by tanker and is    
 taken to St. Erth creamery 10 miles   
 away.                                 
 Crops are mainly hay, cereals are     
 hardly grown at all neither are  root 
 crops.                                
 Very few sheep are kept a few on the  
 Eastern side of the area near         
 Stithians Reservoir.
