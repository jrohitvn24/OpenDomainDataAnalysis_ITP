		<title>12MY SUNDAY IN LYDFORD</title>
		<content> After breakfast on Sundays we usually 
 go down to the Castle but not nearly  
 so many times we go down to the Gorge.
 Sometimes on the way down we stop at  
 the Post Office and dad buys us an ice
 lolly and he buys a newspaper and a   
 packet of Cigarettes.At the Castle we 
 play hit or something like that.When  
 we are bored with football we go      
 looking for dens and that is over the 
 hedge at the back of the Castle.We    
 sometimes go down to the old Saxon    
 Fort and we make a swing.Sometimes the
 rope falls off the branch and we roll 
 down the hill but we do not get hurt  
 because it is not very high.After that
 we go for a drink at the Castle Inn   
 and sometimes a packet of crisps.     
 Then we go home.                      
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
