		<title>13BATTLEFIELD FARM, BROMSGROVE</title>
		<content>    We live at Battlefield Farm, named 
 after a battle between the Roundheads 
 and Cavaliers. Our parents get up at  
 6.00am. Daddy milks the cows, mummy   
 feeds the calves. A neighbour takes us
 to school. Mummy fills one pint       
 containers with milk from the tank and
 stores them in the fridge. Some milk  
 is sold to callers, but the rest goes 
 to the Milk Marketing Board. A man    
 comes to milk the cows at night, and  
 sometimes other people help too. The  
 M5 motorway has used some of our      
 fields so daddy has bought others. Our
 farm is dairy with some beef cows that
 go to Kidderminster market. We grow   
 potatoes, wheat, barley, oats, peas,  
 fodder beet, swedes and grass. We sell
 potatoes at the door, the grass is for
 silage. Other crops are fed to the    
 cows. Daddy finishes work at 7.00pm,  
 watches television and falls asleep.  </content>
