		<title>01The Calne-Cherhill Area</title>
		<content> Our area consists of the south east   
 corner of the town of{Calne,}the      
 village of{Cherhill,}the hamlets of   
{Calstone Wellington}and{Theobald's    
{Green,}and all, or part of, 23 farms. 
                                       
 So the area is mainly farmland but is 
 quite well populated. A rather unusual
 aspect of the area is the presence of 
 several{American Forces}families      
 living in R.A.F. married quarters     
 between{Cherhill}and{Compton Bassett. 
                                       
 The main{A4 London to Bristol}road    
 runs directly east-west through the   
 area but this has become less busy and
 congested than it was since the M4    
 motorway opened in December 1971.     
                                       
 The{River Marden,}a tributary of the  
 Avon, rises and flows through the area
 past an old watermill at{Quemerford. }</content>
