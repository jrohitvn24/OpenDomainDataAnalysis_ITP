		<content> Four relatively large landowners, who 
 run their farming operations from     
 Upper Honeydon, Goodwick, The Falls   
 (Staploe) and Basmead (Staploe) work  
 1100, 1430, 750 and 1000 acres        
 respectively. Typically "North        
 Bedfordshire clay" farmers with       
 approximately 80% of their land in    
 cereals, they use potatoes, brussel   
 sprouts, field peas and beans as      
 break-crops. Farmers at Field Farm,   
 Two Brewers, Coxfield, Cottage Farm   
 and Bushmead Farm grow similar crops  
 on a smaller scale. All are owner     
 occupiers. Some sugar beet, onions and
 cauliflowers are grown and a small    
 acreage of land is under grass, let   
 for sheep grazing and cattle. The farm
 at Coxfield owns and grazes 80 cattle.
 There is a 120-sow pig-unit at Tythe  
 Farm. There is still a relatively high
 labour force for harvesting vegetables</content>
