		<content> The vineyard is sighted between       
 Singleton and West Dean,and is owned  
 by Ian and Andrew Paget.They first    
 started producing wine in 1974.       
   On an average day during harvest    
 time,1-4 tonnes of grapes are         
 picked.The grapes are pressed in a    
 large 'tombola',which traps the skins 
 but leaves the juice, and sometimes   
 the stalks.                           
   The vines do not require artificial 
 food,as they grow well in the chalky  
 soil of the area.                     
   The most expensive wine produced    
 costs Â£3.80 per bottle,and the        
 cheapest,'Grapple',is Â£2.70 per       
 bottle.                               
   The vineyard has an average of 8000 
 visitors a year,and lies on the site  
 of a Southern Railway station.        
  The total area occupied by the       
 vineyard is 13 acres (5.2 hectares.)  </content>
