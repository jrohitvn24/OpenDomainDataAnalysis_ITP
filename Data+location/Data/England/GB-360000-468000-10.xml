		<title>10THE CHURCH AT LOWER TATHAM.</title>
		<content> The tower of the church of St James   
 the Less in the diocese of Blackburn  
 dates back to 1220. The church lies   
 one and a half miles from Wennington. 
 The parish covers about 3,000 acres   
 and 150 people. Generally 20 people   
 attend the Sunday service, although   
 numbers increase to about 50 at       
 special or family services, where the 
 vicar directs his attention towards   
 the children. It is a basic Anglican  
 church using the Book of Common       
 Prayer, preferred by the older people 
 but it has been criticised for making 
 no attempt to attract or interest the 
 youth of the parish. The church       
 officials prefer a steady predictable 
 income from offerings and the         
 collection rather than from           
 fund-raising events like garden fetes.
 Little change seems likely.
