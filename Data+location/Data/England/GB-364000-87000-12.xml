		<title>12Winterborne Monkton</title>
		<content>   Winterborne Monkton lies in the     
 shadow of Maiden Castle. It is a quiet
 little place not really on the way to 
 anywhere although an unclassified road
 does twist beneath the great          
 earthworks of Maiden Castle, leading  
 to Martinstown.                       
   The village was first named after   
 the River Winterborne which flows     
 through the village.                  
   Winterborne means winter flowing    
 stream. These are caused by a fault in
 the chalk, forming springs in the     
 winter. In the summer these springs   
 dry up.                               
   Monkton means a village of monks.   
 The village belonged to the Clunac    
 Friary of Le Vaast near Boulogne      
 from the early 13th century.
