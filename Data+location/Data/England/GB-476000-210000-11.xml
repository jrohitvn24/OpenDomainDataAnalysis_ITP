		<content>St. Johns psychiatric hospital is      
situated in Stone.It serves a large    
area of Buckinghamshire.               
 The main building which houses all the
wards was mainly constructed during the
Victorian era, although there has been 
many additions during recent years.    
There are wooden prefabricated huts    
around the original brick buildings.   
 Hospital staff accomodation has       
progressed over the last eighty years  
from a row of houses along the Oxford  
Road,opposite the hospital, to a small 
housing estate including two blocks of 
flats.                                 
 Within the hospital grounds other     
buildings include a sports and social  
club, a church and a fire station with 
its own tender specifically to serve   
St. Johns.
