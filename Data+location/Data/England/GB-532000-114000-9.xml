 retired Lightermen and Watermen of the
 River Thames, all of whom have the    
 freedom of the River Thames.A member  
 of the Leaney family has been a care_ 
 taker there since the cottages were   
 built by the Vokins family of         
 Brighton.In East End Lane are three   
 Lucy Brangwyn Cottages,a charitable   
 trust set up by the artist Frank      
 Brangwyn in memory of his wife.       
 Recently completed is Dumbrell's Court
 (on the site of the old private school
 known as Dumbrells) described as      
 "luxuriously appointed retirement     
 homes in an idyllic downland village".

 ings consisting of flats,bungalows,and
