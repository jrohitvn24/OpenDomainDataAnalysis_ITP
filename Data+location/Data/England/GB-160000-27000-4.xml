		<content> Apart from tin mining the granite of  
 Tregonning Hill has decomposed to form
 China Clay{(Kaolin).}Men from the     
 village quarried this china clay from 
 a large pit on the hill. The china    
 clay was cut into cubes and           
 transported down to the port of       
 Porthleven.                           
                                       
       The tin ore from the mines was  
 sent firstly to Redruth and later to  
 St Just in West Penwith. The tin      
 stamps which crushed the ore in the   
 mines worked all day and night and    
 could be heard from the village.      
                                       
       Ashton was also the site of one 
 of Helston's toll houses funding the  
 town council.
