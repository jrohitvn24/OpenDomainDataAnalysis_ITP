		<title>16LIFE ON TRELIVER FARM</title>
		<content>  Every day my dad gets up at four     
 o'clock to milk the cows.We have a    
 herd of 278 cows.My dad comes in at 8 
 o'clock for his breakfast.After that  
 he scrapes out the yard of muck.      
  On our farm we have two 270 acres .  
 That land is mostly grass.Every       
 year we have silage and straw. Silage 
 is grass chopped up. Straw is the     
 waste prouct of corn.                 
  At twelve o'clock my Dad goes in for 
 his dinner.He carries out any         
 necessary jobs in the afternoon.At the
 moment he is working on a silage      
 pit. It has to be cemented.           
  At three o'clock he starts the       
 afternoon milking. It takes him until 
 8 o'clock at night to finish.It takes 
 six hours to do a whole days milking. 
  My dad would like to give up farming 
 because of days like this.
