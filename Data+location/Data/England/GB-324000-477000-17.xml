  Many people visit Swarthmoor Hall    
 during the summer months.When I went  
 after being in the sunshine my eyes   
 had to get use to dark looking house. 
 They dining room was beautiful and    
 there are many interesting features   
 likes the funny bearded jars.         
  You can look as much as you like but 
 you will never find another four      
 poster Newell post like the one at    
 Swarthmoor Hall.                      
  The trip-step on the stairs is very  
 interesting.Quakers come from the USA 
 to visit Swarthmoor Hall.Many years   
 ago,Quakers fled to Pennsylvania and  
 they return to visit the Hall.Some    
 vistors enjoy walking on the fells in 
 and around Pennington.The anicent     
 stocks at the gate of Pennington      
 Church are often photographed as      
 people enjoy their visit to the church</content>
