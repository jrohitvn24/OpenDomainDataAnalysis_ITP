		<title>17The Game 'Stuck in the Mud'</title>
		<content> Stuck in the mud is a game which has  
 to be played by three or four people  
 or even more.  One person is on, and  
 all the other people have to run away.
 The person who is on tries to catch   
 everyone else.  When someone is       
 caught, that person has to stand with 
 their legs apart and they are not     
 allowed to move.  To free them,       
 another person has to go under the    
 legs of the person who is caught.  The
 'catcher' is not allowed to catch a   
 person if they are all standing still 
 with no one to free them, then the    
 last person to be caught is then on.  
 If a lot of people are all playing    
 together, instead of catching         
 everyone, the 'catcher' has to catch  
 one person five times and then that   
 person is on.
