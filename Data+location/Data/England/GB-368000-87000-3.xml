		<content>{Maumbury Rings}is on the Southern     
 outskirts of Dorchester. The Earth    
 Works were constructed in the Late    
 Neolithic Period. After A.D.43, it was
 used as a Roman Amphitheatre. In      
 1685, Judge Jeffreys hanged here some 
 of the rebels from the Monmouth       
 Rebellion. Now it is used as a public 
 walking area and a tourist site.      
 On the Northern side of the Broadmayne
 road traces have been found of a      
 Neolithic circular{Woodhenge,}with an 
 area of 4 - 5 hectares, enclosed by a 
 bank and a ditch .It is thought to    
 have been larger and more important   
 than Stonehenge.                      
 Beside the river are the sites of     
{two ancient lost villages}and a       
 church (St.German's). One village was 
 called Winterborne Farringdon.        
 There are twelve{Tumuli}in the area.
