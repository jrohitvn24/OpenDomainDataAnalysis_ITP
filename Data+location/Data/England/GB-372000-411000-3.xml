		<content> bought by the tenants and these are in
 better condition.                     
 Elsewhere,estates of modern semi and  
 detached houses have been built on the
 slopes behind the main roads.These    
 houses are well-kept,attractive and   
 popular.Most have been built since    
 1960.All have gardens at the front and
 to the rear.                          
   "My garden has grass and moss and   
 flowers round the edge.There are trees
 and bushes near the house.The back    
 gets the sun so you can have your     
 meals out there.My dog loves the      
 back,she chases about in it.Flowers   
 including azaleas,delphiniums,lupins  
 and ice plants."                      
 Most of these houses are in           
 Bradshaw,Harwood and Bromley Cross.   
 The new houses have engulfed the old  
 ones and so the area has become built 
 up in postwar years.                  </content>
