		<title>19CROSSFIELD FARM</title>
		<content> In summer 1984,Durleigh Brook ran dry.
 Mrs.Dosson and her two sons had to    
 bore a hole for water.The first       
 estimation was 100 ft but they had    
 to drill an extra 33 ft before water  
 was reached.This water was            
 reached.This water was pumped into a  
 tank by means of a immersible pump.The
 water is soily.The animals drink the  
 water,which keeps the water           
 flowing.Crossfield farm has forty cows
 min. 200 cows max.A five month old cow
 costs Â£200,a fully grown cow costs    
 Â£600 and a bull can cost Â£2,000.The   
 calves at eleven months are sold at   
 highbridge market.The butchers buy    
 them from there.Cows are fed hay and  
 silage,but this year they are to be   
 fed on barley,because of the excessive
 grain stores.
