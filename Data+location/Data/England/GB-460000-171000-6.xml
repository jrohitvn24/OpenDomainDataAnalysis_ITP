		<content> Mrs Alice Cooke, who is 100 years old,
 visited our school. She talked to us  
 in classroom which she used in 1892.  
 She remembered Queen Victoria visiting
 Theale. One of her duties was to fetch
 water for drinking and washing from   
 the village pump. She said the        
 Headmaster, Mr Rudd, was very strict. 
 He used to come straight from his     
 kitchen through a side door into the  
 classroom. He carried a stick and     
 caned the people who were naughty. He 
 also used a strap. People who were    
 good at music practised in his house. 
 Mrs Cooke said that she had learned to
 read at school and that she did a lot 
 of sewing. She was taught many songs  
 and heard stories from the Bible.     
 Sometimes the Bishop visited the      
 school.
