		<title>05GUITING POWER.PARISH COUNCIL</title>
		<content>    The two villages in our area are   
 run by Parish Councils, Guiting Power 
 Parish Council and Naunton Parish     
 Council. The Council in our village   
 meets every second month, and any     
 parishioners who wish may come and    
 listen. Once a year, an Annual Parish 
 Meeting is held, where parishioners   
 may speak.                            
    The Council discusses such matters 
 as planning permission for buildings, 
 keeping the roads clear in winter,    
 civil defence, footpaths and various  
 charities.                            
    Parish Council members are elected 
 by the parishioners, and they are each
 given a job to do. For example, one   
 Councillor is a School Governor.      
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
