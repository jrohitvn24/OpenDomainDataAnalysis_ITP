		<content>    I live in the West End of          
 Haltwhistle.  I get up at 7 o'clock in
 the morning, have my breakfast and get
 dressed.  I come to our{New School    
 with my mum and brother, who is in the
 nursery.  At school I am in the green 
 area.  I do number, write stories and 
 paint pictures.  At break I play games
 with my friends.  I play the recorder 
 in assembly.  I go home at half past  
 three.                                
    After school I go to the swimming  
 pool or play out with my friends.  We 
 play hopscotch, skipping and "Mams and
 Dads".                                
    On Monday nights I go to the       
{Brownies.} We do work for our badges, 
 we play games and sing.  This year we 
 went to Blyth for the "75 Years of    
 Guiding" celebrations.  There were    
 fireworks and a disco.
