		<title>17DANES' HILL, DALWOOD.</title>
		<content> Danes Hill is called Danes Hill       
 because the Danes fought on it. People
 used it for lighting beacons to warn  
 other villages of danger. There are   
 about 14 houses on Danes Hill. There  
 is one called Bagaton. It is very old 
 and it used to be a pub. There are    
 electricity pylons all around the     
 hill. There is a badgers set and there
 are lots of rabbits. You also see lots
 of squirrels and a few foxes. A lot of
 people who live on Danes Hill are old 
 people.Danes Hill is owned by Mr Pike 
 but you are allowed to walk up it any 
 time you want. From the top of Danes  
 Hill to the west you can see Dalwood. 
 On the other side of the hill is the  
 valley of the River Yarty. Normally   
 sheep graze on the hillside.
