		<title>20Seaton Grange Farm</title>
		<content>    This family-run farm is 500 acres, 
 377 being owned and the rest rented.  
 Most of the fields have had to be     
 drained, with the help of government  
 grants. Some of the original hawthorn 
 hedges of the 19th Century enclosures 
 remain, but many have been cleared,   
 and a few willow have been planted for
 aesthetic reasons.                    
    Each field is named e.g.Red Land,  
 House Close, Home Field, North Common.
 When the farm was bought by the family
 in the 1930s, animals were kept, but  
 now the farm is just arable. Good     
 prices may be obtained for cereals    
 today, less labour is needed, and the 
 family is not tied to the farm as it  
 would be with animals. Crop rotation  
 is : 1year peas/beans, 3years winter  
 wheat, 1year winter barley. Sugar beet
 is sold to the British Sugar Corp. and
 oats are grown for muesli.            </content>
