		<content> The only permanent services in the    
 hamlet are a telephone box and a post 
 box. Deliveries of milk, bread, meat  
 etc. arrive on a regular basis.       
 A mobile library visits weekly and    
 refuse is collected regularly. Mains  
 electricity and water are available. A
 mini-bus service, twice weekly, to and
 from Bath is the nearest public       
 transport. The only other bus service 
 is more than a mile away. The majority
 of residents have their own transport 
 to reach the nearest church and post  
 office at Englishcombe. The  nearest  
 doctors, dentists and hospitals are in
 Bath. Most purchases of food clothing 
 and household items involve car travel
  No schools are found in this area;   
 all pupils have to be transported to  
 and from school. The local villages   
 have some sport, dancing facilities   
 and other spare time pursuits.        </content>
