		<title>13My Weekend,Bradford</title>
		<content>   I got up on Saturday morning at 7 o'
 clock and went down to watch TV.Then I
 got dressed and had breakfast.I had   
 Wheataflakes.I then went out to play. 
 After my dinner I had to get into my  
 newspaper costume because I was on the
 float for the June Fair,which is to   
 raise money for the church.I had to   
 meet the float behind the library and 
 then we went to the church hall.I     
 entered the fancy dress show.I played 
 out after tea and then went to bed.   
   On Sunday,after getting up and      
 having breakfast,I went out to play   
 with Andrew,Tanya And Sara.At Andrew's
 house we put on some records and had a
 disco.After tea I called for Sara.She 
 had her tent up and we played in it.  
   Later I went to my nana's and       
 played.Then I called for Amanda and   
 played funny games.My Dad then came   
 for me -time for my bath and then bed.</content>
