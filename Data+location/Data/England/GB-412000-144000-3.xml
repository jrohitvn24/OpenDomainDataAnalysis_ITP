		<content> SCHOOL PRODUCTIONS ARE VERY EXCITING. 
 IT IS NICE TO GO TO ALL THE           
 REHEARSALS.ALTHOUGH IT'S HARD WORK    
 LEARNING ALL THE WORDS,ACTIONS AND    
 DANCES IT IS ALL WORTH WHILE. I       
 STARRED IN "JOSEPH AND THE AMAZING    
 TECHNICOOUR DREAMCOAT".I WAS DANCING. 
 IT WAS BRILLIANT FUN DOING ALL THE    
 DANCES. I DANCED IN THEM ALL.THE FIRST
 NIGHT IS THE BEST NIGHT BECAUSE YOU'RE
 READY TO GO AND EXCITED.AFTER ABOUT   
 SEVEN REHEARSALS YOU'RE ACTUALLY DOING
 IT. YOU FEEL VERY NERVOUS BUT ABOUT   
 TWO MINUTES INTO THE FIRST DANCE YOU  
 JUST WANT TO ENOY YOURSELF.IT WENT ON 
 FOR ABOUT AN HOUR AND A HALF,WE DID   
 THREE PERFORMANCES,ONE FOR CHILDREN OF
 THE SCHOOL AND THE OTHERS FOR PARENTS.
 MR RYDER WAS CONDUCTING THE MUSIC,    
 THERE WAS A CHOIR.THERE WAS AN        
 INTERVAL HALF WAY THROUGH THEN WE WENT
 ON. I ENJOYED STARRING IN IT VERY MUCH</content>
