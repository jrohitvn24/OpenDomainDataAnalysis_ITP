		<title>09GARBURN PLACE.</title>
		<content>    When I was young the houses in     
 Garburn Place were made of wood and   
 metal. Only the side walls were made  
 of bricks. The rain made the wood rot 
 so the council had to knock down the  
 front and back of the houses. Just the
 side walls were left up. We had to    
 move to Kirkstone Place until our     
 house was rebuilt. I went to see what 
 they were doing in Garburn Place. They
 were pulling out the windows and the  
 doors. Then they pulled the wood and  
 metal off. Two men were rebuilding the
 wooden walls with bricks. They put new
 windows in. Now the house is nice and 
 we have moved back in. The builders   
 made a mess of my garden and we had to
 tidy it up. Since we moved back, the  
 builders have been coming backwards   
 and forwards doing things to the doors
 and windows. They have painted them. I
 like my house better now than before. </content>
