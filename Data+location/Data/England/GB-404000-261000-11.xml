		<content> The Green Dragon pub has parts which  
 are 17th century and it may have been 
 a pub ever since then. Before, it was 
 a carters' inn where the drivers met  
 before driving through the dangerous  
 Feckenham forest. The market used to  
 be held behind the pub.               
                                       
 There is an ancient railway line which
 used to be a vital link line.         
 Sambourne has a lot of features       
 including a trout farm, monks baths   
 and its own village shop. Most of the 
 buildings in Sambourne are very old.  
 One next to the pub is especially old.
 It has all of its old beams still     
 intact. In the middle of the village  
 green there is a tree which was       
 planted to commemorate Edward VII,    
 although the first tree died.
