		<content>   The wheat crop is planted at the end
 of September and harvested in the     
 middle of August.It has{11 months     
 growth so it will produce a greater   
 yield. The ear grows from November    
 onwards,but it is inside the stem. If 
 you split the stem you should be able 
 to see the ear and the{5}internodes   
 inside. The stem elongates like a     
 telescope. Disease prevention is      
 practised as on the barley crop.      
    Wheat and barley have{1 tonne}an   
 acre{less}if they are planted in the  
 Spring.The grain is sent to Ethiopia  
 for famine-relief and also to Ireland.
   Wild oats are like a weed in a crop.
 This plant can stay in the ground for 
 over a {100 years}and still germinate.
 There is a new grain crop called      
 triticalli,and as it is less prone to 
 disease, farmers can grow it more     
 cheaply.                              </content>
