		<title>15      MR.H.LEATHLEY</title>
		<content>    The Leathley family have been      
 connected with Masham for many years. 
 Victoria and Sara Jayne went to       
 interview Mr.H.Leathley who lives up  
 Gun Bank.He was born in 1928 and went 
 to Masham School.                     
    He was asked if he remembered his  
 school days.He said he remembered     
 doing the usual things like playing   
 football and cricket.Maths was his    
 favourite subject.He did lots of      
 adding and subtracting.He said that   
 first thing in the morning after      
 prayers was music."The Schoolmaster   
 was crazy-mad about music.I believe he
 was the choir master at the church."  
    What did he think of Masham today? 
 Had it changed a lot? "Not really,it  
 hasn't changed a great deal,except for
 the Post Office.It used to be the     
 Chapel and the Post Office was a      
 wooden hut."                          </content>
