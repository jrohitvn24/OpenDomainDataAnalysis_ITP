		<title>11TRENT VALLEY, BURSTON AREA</title>
		<content>                                       
The Trent Valley is wide in this area. 
The flood plain, known locally as "The 
Washlands" is unsuitable for building; 
these meadows are used for grazing.    
                                       
The main road follows the valley, but  
keeps to the higher ground to the east.
Both the Trent &amp; Mersey Canal and the  
railway have also been constructed     
along the river valley between the     
river and the road, so the valley has  
thus developed as a focus for          
transport.                             
                                       
Access between the two sides of the    
valley is restricted to bridges. There 
is only one footbridge crossing the    
Trent in this area. The nearest road   
bridge is just west of Sandon.
