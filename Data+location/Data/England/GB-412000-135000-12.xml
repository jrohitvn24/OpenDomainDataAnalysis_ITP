		<title>12FISHING AT WOODFORD</title>
		<content>  In the river there are mainly{trout  
 and{grayling.}Also there are other    
 freshwater fish such as salmon,       
 pike,roach and smaller fish.          
{FISHING FOR TROUT. Trout}will bite at 
 any bait. The{fishermen}try to imitate
 natural movements of the flies at that
 time of year. In May mayflies are a   
 popular bait, then from June onwards  
 nymphs are used as bait (these are the
 offspring of dragonflies and other    
 creatures).                           
{SALMON.}The 'hen' fish digs a hollow  
 in the gravel where she lays the eggs.
 The 'cock' then fertilises the eggs   
 and they begin to form. After a year  
 the developed{salmon}swim out to sea. 
 Some go far out to sea, but others    
 stay near the coast. After about two  
 years the{salmon}will return to the   
 river to be caught.
