 quite recently been extensively       
 developed,supervised by the Yorkshire 
 Wildlife Trust, it is within easy     
 walking distance of the two villages. 
    We're fortunate in having a good   
 amount of land reserved for           
 recreational facilities. There are    
 village football teams for Under 11's,
 Under 12's, Under 13's and Under 14's,
 and they have their own football      
 pitch. Golfers can choose from either 
 Hickleton Golf Course or the High     
 Melton Golf Course.                   
    There are livery stables situated  
 in the old part of the village, and   
 pasture is available for grazing.     
    Barnburgh Male Voice Choir was     
 formed in 1982. Practices are held in 
 Barnburgh W.M.C. twice each week.A    
 wide programme of events is
