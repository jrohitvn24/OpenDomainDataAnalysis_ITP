		<title>09Farming in Chelmsley Wood</title>
		<content> Farm land has been lost due to the    
 growth of Chelmsley Wood, the         
 establishments of trading estates, and
 the creation of good roads and        
 motorways.Typical of the farms in this
 area is Fifields, run as a dairy farm 
 with a little cultivation of grain,   
 turnips and fodder. Evidence in the   
 changing pattern of farming is        
 illustrated by the introduction of new
 crops such as seed rape which is      
 highly profitable. Land in the south  
 east is mainly green belt. In the     
 future this land use may change as    
 high tech industry is to be           
 introducted. Sites chosen for this    
 include Fifields farm and Birchcroft  
 farm and the area around the N.E.C.   
 These prepared plans are being opposed
 by Solihull Council and the Ministry  
 of Agriculture.(Who want the area to  
 remain as green belt).                </content>
