		<content> Local people seem to take a           
 conservative attitude towards the     
 land, disliking much change.          
 The Devon hedgerows are particularly  
 appreciated, always alive with a      
 succession of wild flowers throughout 
 the year. Snowdrops, primroses,       
 daffodils, bluebells, campions,       
 foxgloves, wild orchids and roses, and
 honeysuckle, flower naturally         
 throughout the area, to everyone's    
 delight.                              
 The recent scurge of Dutch Elm Disease
 has changed the landscape as it has   
 meant the felling of practically all  
 the elms in the area. A policy of     
 replanting has encouraged the         
 replacement with a variety of         
 deciduous saplings.
