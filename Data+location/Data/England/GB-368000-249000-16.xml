		<content> The large houses are mainly farmhouses
 and many smaller houses were          
 originally farm cottages. Many are old
 sixteenth century onward, 20  houses  
 in the area are listed, 21 have been  
 built since the war. The houses are   
 mainly stone, with some timber        
 framing, very little brick. The school
 has been turned into council houses.  
 Except for the houses inhabited by    
 farm workers and the council houses,  
 most houses are owner occpied. Some   
 old houses have been modernised with  
 the help of government grants.  Until 
 recently planning authorities refused 
 permission for new houses in the      
 country claiming that the inhabitants 
 of such houses made abnormal demands  
 on social services. Now there seems to
 be a change. A redundant farm complex 
 is being converted into five houses   
 and two bungalows are to be built.    </content>
