		<title>06OUR SCHOOL</title>
		<content>  Our school was built eleven years    
 ago.We have a great big playing field 
 which is owned by the Mary Wheatley   
 Trust.                                
  Hot cafeteria meals are available in 
 the school for 58p but half the       
 children bring a packed lunch. Noone  
 goes home at dinnertime.              
  In the playground we play marbles,   
 stuck in the mud and on our apparatus.
 When it is wet we play indoors with   
 chess, ludo, cards on, the computer or
 wedraw.                               
  Every year we have a concert. We have
 done Joseph and his Technicolour Dream
 Coat, zThe Horse of Wood and this year
 we are doing Out of this World.       
 Everyone joins in the singing but some
 people have speaking or soslo singing 
 parts.
