		<title>02THE PARISH CHURCH</title>
		<content>    The Parish Church of St. Mary's and
 All Saints is now over 660 years old. 
 It is a large church just off the     
 market place with a tower and a spire.
 This tower can be seen from nearly    
 everywhere in Bingham. It has 8 bells 
 and they are rung every day. On the   
 tower there are 4 clock faces which   
 are light blue with gold hands and    
 figures. There are 4 statues, one on  
 each corner of the tower, of the 4    
 Bingham rectors who became Bishops.   
    The church clock itself is 105     
 years old. One evening in 1975 when   
 the clock was being wound, the eyebolt
 broke and the clock came crashing     
 down. Luckily the choir had just moved
 from the place where it fell! After   
 this accident the clock was           
 electrified and 3 motors were put in, 
 but the original clock remains.
