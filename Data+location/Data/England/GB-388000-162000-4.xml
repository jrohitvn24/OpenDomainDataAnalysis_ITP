		<title>04THE MELKSHAM NEWS</title>
		<content>   The Melksham News has been running  
 for 4 years.  It gets the money to    
 produce the paper from advertising.   
 Quite a lot of people advertise, but  
 not as many as the editor had hoped.  
 The paper is free and every house in  
 Melksham has one.  People who deliver 
 themare aged between 14 &amp; 40.  They   
 have to go on 20 rounds and have 40   
 people.  People write in the newspaper
 about issues like the building of     
 housing estates and supermarkets.  The
 main  news item at the moment is that 
 Melksham is trying out a new bin      
 scheme.  They are changing the plastic
 bags to moveable dustbins.  They are  
 testing it out in parts of the town.  
 If it is successful, all of the area  
 will have them.
