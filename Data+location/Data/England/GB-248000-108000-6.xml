		<title>06PETROCKSTOWE SCHOOL CHILDREN</title>
		<content> The Church School in{Petrockstowe,    
 which had two classes of 20-25 pupils,
 closed in l960 because the Church did 
 not keep up the repairs.  The site now
 accommodates the village hall,{Baxter 
{Hall,}where a pre-school Playgroup for
 some 18 children under 5 is organised.
 The local schoolchildren have to      
 travel 2 miles to Merton to attend    
{Clinton Primary School,}or 6 miles to 
 Great Torrington for the{Comprehensive
{Secondary School. }Pupils for the     
 latter travel by school bus, leaving  
 home at around 7.30 am.  50% of the   
 schoolchildren will continue their    
 education beyond the compulsory age of
 16, 60% to attend Technical College,  
 40% aiming for a University course.   
 Further education is available at     
 Bideford, Torrington and Beaford (5-12
 miles), both evening and day          
 classes being held.                   </content>
