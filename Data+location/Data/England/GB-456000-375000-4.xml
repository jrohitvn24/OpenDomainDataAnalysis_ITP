		<title>04The Welbeck Estate Workforce</title>
		<content>     At present the Welbeck Estates Co.
 employs a 28 strong workforce to fell 
 timber. They consist of               
                                       
      Workers                  22      
      Students (Agricultural)   3      
      Foresters                 1      
      Foresters Assistant       1      
      Secretaries               1      
                                       
     The timber felling is rotated from
 one plantation to the next so there is
 always work to do. The timber is not  
 felled very often if new trees are    
 being planted due to the lack of      
 sufficient workmen.                   
     There used to be many people who  
 worked on the estate when it was run  
 by the Dukes of Portland but many     
 people have moved to local towns to   
 work in better paid jobs.
