		<title>13STOWEY CHURCH</title>
		<content> Mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086
 as having 1 villager,1 smallholder and
 1 plough, the village's population is 
 now 80. There is a small and very     
 beautiful church dedicated to St.     
 Nicholas and St.Mary built in 1235    
 with local wool merchant's money. A   
 pair of shears carved into the outside
 wall commemorates this gift and local 
 prosperity.The Church contains many   
 fine paintings by Lord Strachey       
 depicting local villagers. There are 5
 bells in the tower but they are no    
 longer rung as the tower and bell     
 platform are considered unsafe.The    
 church is in need of much restoration 
 and electrical re-wiring.The hard work
 and generosity of this small village  
 raised Â£524 for church funds at a     
 recent barbecue.
