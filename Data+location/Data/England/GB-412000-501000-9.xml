		<content>  Mr and Mrs Spiers are a young couple 
 who live on a council estate in our   
 area. They have lived there for  three
 years,and are both out of work. Mr    
 Spiers worked in a cinema until it    
 closed down.                          
  Mrs Spiers has a seven month baby,   
 (Katherine). Mrs Spiers has some      
 hobbies, walking, swimming, she never 
 gets bored, because she looks after   
 the baby all the time.                
 Mr and Mrs Spiers sometimes goes to   
 the sea, they have a car. When Mrs    
 Spiers was a little girl she lived in 
 Lancashire, she did not go to college.
 Before they both came to Richmond they
 both lived in a flat.                 
 They do not have any pets but they    
 would like a cat. If Mrs Spiers had   
 five minutes extra she would do some  
 knitting. At Christmas they will eat  
 and drink and enjoy themselves.       </content>
