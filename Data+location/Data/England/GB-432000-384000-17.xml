		<title>17TRAFFIC SURVEY</title>
		<content> The traffic survey took place on the  
 A57 outside our school at Crosspool in
 the summer of 1985 during both the    
 rush hours and the quiet hours of the 
 day.                                  
 In the main rush hour between 0800hrs.
 and 0900 hrs. four times as many cars 
 were travelling into town than out. In
 the off-peak hours the traffic        
 travelling in and out of town was     
 approximately the same. Buses came    
 every fifteen minutes.                
 Two thirds of our class voted that the
 pavements on Manchester Road should be
 wider. Many parents think that there  
 should be a Pelican crossing here     
 instead of the crossing lady that we  
 now have. Mr Stocks, our old traffic  
 warden, died after a car hit him while
 he was showing a child across the road
 in December 1984.
