		<content> The "Guinea Pig"                      
 During the war many airmen were very  
 badly burnt.These men were brought to 
 the Queen Victoria Hospital and       
 operated on by Dr McIndoe.He was able 
 to rebuild  the faces and hands of    
 these airmen. The process of          
 skingrafting took many months and in  
 some cases up to a hundred operations 
 spread over several years. While the  
 airmen were at the hospital they      
 formed a club called the Guinea Pig   
 club. It is the only one of its sort  
 in the world.Near the hospital is a   
 public house named "The Guinea Pig".In
 September every year it welcomes back 
 members of the club.Also not far away 
 is a housing estate with "Lancaster   
 Drive", "Stirling Way","Merlin Way"   
 and "Blenheim Close"- names of the    
 engine and famous aeroplanes of the   
 last war.                             </content>
