		<title>01South Cambridge Area Summary</title>
		<content>    The southern part of the city of   
 Cambridge lies mostly below 15m on the
 east side of the valley of the river  
 Cam, which meanders northward across  
 alluvial gravels on underlying chalk. 
    South Cambridge is served by 2 main
 roads, A10 from Royston and A604 from 
 Haverhill, and a railway line with    
 Cambridge station located south-east  
 of the city centre.Within the built-up
 area the north-west is mainly occupied
 by University Colleges and Institut-  
 ions, while the rest is 19th and early
 20th century suburban residential     
 development, with associated schools, 
 churches &amp; other services. Commercial 
 zones are situated along the railway  
 line and roads leading towards the    
 city centre.                          
    Around the outskirts are open      
 fields, mainly river pastures, ex-    
 tending south to Trumpington village. </content>
