		<content>{A typical Saturday}for my family      
 starts at 7.30 a.m. My Dad wakes      
 everyone up when he turns on the radio
 and he is making our breakfast. I have
 to take my dog for a walk. We drive to
 the{shopping centre}and my mum buys   
 all the food we need. It takes 10     
 minutes to drive to my grandmother's  
 house. We stay with her for lunch and 
 then my Dad and I go to watch a{rugby 
{match.}My Dad sometimes plays for the 
 team. After picking up my mum and gran
 we go home for tea. My sister and I   
 usually watch{television}while mum and
 dad get ready to go out for the       
 evening. My gran looks after us so    
 that mum and dad can go out to the{   
{club}for a drink or a meal. Sometimes 
 we play{cards or board games,}or if it
 is fine I am allowed out on my{bike}  
 with my friends. I have a{shower,}eat 
 my{supper}and go to bed at 10 p.m.    </content>
