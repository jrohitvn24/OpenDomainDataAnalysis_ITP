		<content> The Street area is steeped in history,
 although the town itself is relatively
 new.The outlying villages are much    
 older and have a wealth of stories and
 superstitions attached to them.Here is
 one of the stories from our area.     
         {The Haunted Trousers         
   Near{Butleigh Wootton}300 years ago 
 was the{Battle of Sedgemoor}between   
 the{Royalists}and{Monmouths}rebels.   
 Just outside Glastonbury there is a   
 road going to Butleigh Wootton with   
 cedar trees on each side forming an   
 avenue.People say that they have seen 
 a pair of trousers and knee length    
 boots walking in and out of the trees.
 People say it is the bottom half of a 
 rebel trying to find his way home from
 the battle.
