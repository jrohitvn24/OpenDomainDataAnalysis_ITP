		<content>  Wednesday really look after their    
 sponsors. They have three special     
 lounges for the guests of their main  
 sponsors, MHS, another for their match
 day sponsors &amp; one for the directors. 
  The referee also has a separate room.
 Nobody can talk to the referee so he  
 has a TV to watch. When he is ready he
 presses a bell which tells the players
 to stand in line for him to check     
 their boots.                          
  51000 can watch games at Hillsborough
 - 25000 sit down, the rest stand. If  
 you pay more you can have a blue seat 
 rather than a white one.              
  The police decide how many people can
 come to a match according to how much 
 trouble they think there might be.    
  Under the stand there are two gyms,  
 where the public are allowed to play  
 football, tennis, basktball, netball, 
 tri-skating and generally keep fit.   </content>
