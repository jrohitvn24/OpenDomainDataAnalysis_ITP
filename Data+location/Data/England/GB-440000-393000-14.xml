		<content> Where I live used to be just fields   
 with a stream on it.All the children  
 who lived there played football and   
 cricket on it.There were no new       
 estates like now,some were fields,    
 some were where other houses stood.   
  There are more houses and shops where
 there used to be farm land.It was only
 a small village in the 1900's.There   
 used to be trams that would run as far
 as Kimberworth Shool,before Old Hall  
 and Kimberworth were built.A lot of   
 old houeses have been knocked down and
 new houses built.
