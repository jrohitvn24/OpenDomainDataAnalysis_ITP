		<title>13Dunn Village Hall,Warbleton</title>
		<content> Money to build a village hall was     
 originally donated by Mr F.G.Dunn in  
 l91O but it was not built until l934  
 on land donated by the Darbys. The    
 hall is used frequently. The Warbleton
 &amp; Buxted band rehearse twice a week &amp; 
 the country &amp; western band once a     
 week. Other weekly users include the  
 doctor and the library service. A     
 chiropodist holds a clinic fortnightly
 whilst two different Womens Institutes
 hold monthly meetings as does the     
 Local History Group. The hall is used 
 occasionally for A.G.M.s, P.C.C.      
 meetings, elections, jumble sales,    
 coffee mornings, children's parties,  
 wedding receptions, dinner &amp; dances,  
 concerts, art exhibitions etc. Hire   
 charges for regular users are Â£2.7O an
 hour. Occasional users pay Â£4.25 an   
 hour whilst a jumble sale requires    
 Â£l6.OO and an election Â£5O.OO.        </content>
