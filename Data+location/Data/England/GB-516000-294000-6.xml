		<content>   The pit filling process continues   
 for 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.  
 Two 48 wagon trains, arrive each day  
 at regular intervals and the ash is   
 removed from 24 wagons simultaneously 
 by pumping compressed air into each of
 the wagons.   The ash first floats and
 then begins to flow out of the wagons,
 when it is then mixed with water to   
 form a {slurry }which is then pumped  
 along a network of pipes and into the 
 pit which has been selected for       
 filling.   As the ash settles, the    
 surface water is drained off by using 
 a weir system, and the water is then  
 pumped back into the main reservoir,  
 itself preeviously a pit, to be used  
 again and again.   When the level of  
 ash has reached the required limits, a
 final layer of 150 mm of topsoil is   
 added in order to attempt to return   
 the land to its original state.       </content>
