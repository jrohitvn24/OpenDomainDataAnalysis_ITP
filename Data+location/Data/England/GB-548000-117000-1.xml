		<title>01General Overview</title>
		<content> This block is a tranquil, sparsely    
 populated rural area of the East      
 Sussex Weald. Cattle, sheep and horses
 graze on pastureland and some corn    
 crops grow in fields of fertile, light
 clay soil. The widespread breeding of 
 poultry is indicated by the many large
 chicken sheds. Farming land is        
 separated from the country lanes by   
 hedges and wide grass verges in which 
 wild flowers grow. Broad-leafed       
 woodland punctuates the landscape. The
 community lacks main drainage and gas.
 There are no schools and the          
 infrequent buses serve only the main  
 roads. The most significant           
 non-agricultural work is provided by a
 group of companies on a farm at Easons
 Green. The only intrusions on this    
 scenic beauty are daily low flying jet
 training aircraft and pylons carrying 
 national grid cables overhead.        </content>
