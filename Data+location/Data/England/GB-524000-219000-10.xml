		<content> We surveyed the parents of the        
 children of Knebworth School and      
 received 157 replies.  Three of the   
 replies came from elsewhere so have   
 been discounted.  We asked the        
 question "How long have you lived in  
 Knebworth?"  Here are the results of  
 the survey:                           
                                       
 We found the following have lived in  
 Knebworth for:                        
                                       
     Under 1 year           {12        
     Between 1 &amp; 5 years   { 43        
     Between 5 &amp; 20 years   {83        
     Over 20 years          {16}       
                                       
 We found that most people have moved  
 to Knebworth in the last 20 years as  
 Knebworth has expanded.
