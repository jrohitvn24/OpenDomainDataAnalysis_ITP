		<title>10THE CHURCHES IN FELTWELL</title>
		<content>   We have three churches in Feltwell. 
 One is redundant. It is St. Nicholas' 
 and there is only one service held    
 there each year now.                  
   The other is St. Mary's which is    
 still going strong. St. Mary's was    
 built between l275 and 1375. About 70 
 people go to church on Sundays. The   
 Rector and the Church Council run the 
 church. The Rector has been changed   
 five times in the last twenty years.  
 People mostly go to St. Mary's because
 they find it more interesting, more   
 room and people find friends there.   
   The Methodist church is in Bell     
 Street but it is only about 50 years  
 old. There were once two smaller      
 chapels. The Methodist minister has   
 two other churches to look after as   
 well as Feltwell.                     
   There is not a Roman Catholic church
 in the village.                       </content>
