		<title>01GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF AREA</title>
		<content> The area covered by this block        
 includes a wide variety of land uses. 
 This area was once very important not 
 only to Newham, but to London as a    
 result of the Royal Docks. These are  
 now closed and the area has come in   
 for a great deal of redevelopment.    
    Many of the older houses have been 
 replaced with a wide variety of       
 housing from tower blocks to houses   
 and maisonettes. Industry is being    
 encouraged to the area and plannners  
 are at pains to ensure sufficient open
 space and recreational facilities.    
    As a result of new housing and     
 industry this is one of the few areas 
 of east London to be growing in terms 
 of its population                     
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
