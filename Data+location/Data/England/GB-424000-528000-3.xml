		<title>03A TYPICAL DAY (Part 1)</title>
		<content> At approximately  7.00 a.m every day I
 get out of bed. It usually takes me   
 about 2 minutes to fully wake up but I
 am nearly always dressed by 7.10 a.m. 
 I go downstairs and get washed at 7.15
 a.m and by 7.30 I am tucking in to my 
 breakfast. Then I put the T.V. on     
 until 8.30 when I go and call for my  
 friend Darren Lidster. He is never    
 ready so it is about 8.35 before we   
 set off for school. When we get to    
 school I have a game of football and  
 Darren goes to see his friends. My    
 favourite lessons are History and     
 Project. I also enjoy doing a         
 crossword. At playtime I play football
 with Carl, Paul and Andrew. At dinner 
 time I have my packed lunch and then I
 go into Mr. Farms' classroom to play  
 "Snapper " on the computer.Paul       
 sometimes comes with me.
