		<content>      Local government in the area     
 falls in the first instance to        
 Mr.E.Sheldon of Worcester _ our County
 Council representative , secondly to  
 Mr.J.Wythes of Crowle who represents  
 us on Wychavon D.C. , and finally to a
 local parish council.                 
      This local council is known as   
 Saleway Parish Council , it has 7     
 reps. who are elected loaclly - 2 from
 Oddingly , 1 from Hadzor , 1 from Sale
 Green &amp; Huddington , 3 from Himbleton.
 Within the parish are also Shell,Earls
 Common,Phepson,Saleway,Shernal Green, 
 and Dunhampstead.                     
      Probably the most important duty 
 of the parish council is to advise on 
 planning applications within its own  
 area. The local planning authority    
 (Wychavon D.C.) are responsible for   
 final planning dicisions.
