		<title>15TRAFFIC (2): WARLEY, ESSEX</title>
		<content>   The construction of the M25 has had 
 several effects on the area. Distance 
 traffic is now encouraged to pass     
 through the area, increasing local    
{traffic noise.}Some roads have been   
 blocked off, e.g. at 578898, although 
 a footbridge and facilities for farm  
 vehicles have been built. Those living
 near the M25 have seen the{value}of   
 their{houses depreciate.}On the       
 positive side, however,{blocked-off   
{lanes}or those along which very little
 traffic now passes have taken on a new
 character. Verge cutting is rare along
 them so that{wild flowers}are more in 
 evidence. The lack of disturbance has 
 encouraged both{nesting birds}and the 
{smaller mammals.}These lanes are      
 beginning to resume the appearance of 
 the Essex landscape as painted by     
 Constable - this in a location only   
 some twenty miles from Tower Bridge.  </content>
