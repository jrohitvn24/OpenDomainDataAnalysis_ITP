		<content>  Since its beginings,Newport has been 
 well served by transport routes.First 
 there was the canal. Then the main    
 road and finally,at the northern end  
 of the village, was  a station where  
 trains running on the Hull and        
 Barnsley railway line stopped.        
  Time has changed these early         
 travelling methods.The canal is no    
 longer used and the railway was closed
 in the 1950's when the lack of coal   
 export made it uneconomical.The road  
 system has also changed dramatically. 
 Eight years ago the  M62 motorway was 
 opened. This meant that three quarters
 of the traffic that used to pass      
 through the village of Newport, was   
 taken  on the new motorway by-pass.   
  For those people without cars, the   
 village is served by a regular  bus   
 service.
