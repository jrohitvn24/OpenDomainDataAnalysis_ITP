		<title>11Health Care in Felton Area</title>
		<content> Some residents are covered for medical
 care at the Bromyard surgery and      
 others at several Hereford surgeries. 
 Health visitors and district nurses   
 make visits to patients' homes.  The  
 three hospitals in Hereford accept all
 local accidents and casualties.  The  
 Bromyard hospital deals with geriatric
 cases.  A private hospital is also    
 available in Hereford.  Dentists are  
 found in Bromyard and Hereford, but   
 they also visit Burley Gate Primary   
 School, as do health visitors and     
 doctors.  Once a month a mobile Infant
 Welfare Clinic visits the area. A     
 nurse and a doctor are in attendance  
 to give advice and medical treatment.
