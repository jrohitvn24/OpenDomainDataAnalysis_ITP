		<content>   In the 195O's a new estate was built
 around Park Road and farmland was also
 taken over by the present fire station
 and ambulance station.   In the 196O's
 Anchor Square was demolished, together
 with  the  Red  Cross  house  and  the
 railway station.   In their places new
 flats and small nursery factories have
 been erected.                         
   A new doctor's surgery  was built in
 Butts Road, as  well  as a new housing
 development on Ashford Road.          
   Lady  Manners  School  was  built in
 1936 on  the  site of former farmland,
 and extensions were  added  during the
 197O's.                               
   As in all towns, recreation plays an
 important   part  in  Bakewell.   Bath
 Gardens, with  its  bowling green, and
 Scott's Meadow were  given to the town
 and converted into a recreation areas.
