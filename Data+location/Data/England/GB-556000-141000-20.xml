		<title>20SPONSORED ORIENTEERING</title>
		<content> Skinners' School 3rd year contributed 
 o the heating and maintenance of the  
 school swimming pool by organising a  
sponsored orienteering event. Based in 
the woods of Southborough Common, the  
exercise started and finished near     
St.Peter's Church. 70 boys, working in 
pairs, were given a map and a route    
with 10 checkpoints. To make sure that 
places were visited in the right order,
6th-form boys signed each pair's sheet 
at each point. Most boys managed to    
complete the course in under 1 hour,   
but some confused the clues and found  
the wrong tree or bench, and others got
totally lost.                          
 Money was raised by each boy obtaining
promises of small sums of money from   
friends for each checkpoint found. Over
#250 was raised. It was thoroughly     
enjoyable too!
