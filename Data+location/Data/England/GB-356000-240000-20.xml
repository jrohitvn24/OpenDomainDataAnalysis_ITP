		<title>20MADONNA HOUSE</title>
		<content>{ Madonna House}is a house for the     
 homeless people who have had problems 
 in their life.                        
  The{Hereford Diocesan Council for    
{social action}saw the urgent need to  
 provide a suitable home for single    
 people which would be so much more    
 than merely a hostel.A place to foster
 a sense of community among the        
 residents leading to shared activities
 while allowing them privacy of a      
 single bedroom.                       
  Residents meetings are held          
 occasionally where people have an     
 opportunity to air their views and    
 help shape the community into one     
 where problems and insights can be    
 shared.                               
  Staff operate their own mini_bus     
 service into Hereford and many make   
 use of this facility on a daily basis.
