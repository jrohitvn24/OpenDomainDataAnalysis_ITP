		<title>11ST LAWRENCE CHURCH, SNAITH</title>
		<content> The church originated in the twelfth  
 century. Records show that over 25000 
 people are buried in the graveyard and
 surrounding Market Place. The church  
 has an embattled western tower with   
 pinnacles, a south porch,nave and     
 transepts. The bells were cast in     
 1778. Some people say that the church 
 is haunted. The statue near the door  
 of Lord Downe was supposed to have    
 come to life.                         
 In one part of the church, ( East side
 as you enter) there little carvings of
 mice on the woodwork.                 
 The most notable monuments are those  
 relating to Sir John Dawnay (1493),   
 Lady Elizabeth Stapylton (1688) and   
 Viscount Downe (1837). Viscount Downe 
 has had a new nose recently.          
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
