		<content> The landscape in our block is in      
 general very flat with only the       
 moraine-hill at Preesall to vary the  
 scene.There are few trees apart from  
 those which have been left to shelter 
 the farm-houses.Wind is a feature of  
 this coastal zone.The views out from  
 our area are,we think, some of the    
 best and most varied of any.We can see
 the docks of Fleetwood together with  
 all the leisure-craft in the Wyre as  
 well as the industrial complex at     
 I.C.I. to the west.To the north we    
 have the whole vista of the Lake      
 District which is breath-taking,west  
 from Walney Island,Barrow-in-Furness  
 to the Penines,the top of Igleborough 
 just visible in the east.Looking to   
 the east we can see the Bowland Hills 
 which form a pleasant contrast to the 
 water and sands of Morecambe Bay with 
 its mountinous back-drop.             </content>
