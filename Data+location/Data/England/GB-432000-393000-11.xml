		<title>11THE GRENOSIDE TRADITIONAL</title>
		<content> The Grenoside sword dancing team      
 started over a hundred years ago in   
 the nineteenth century.There are 6    
 dancers, a captain,and a fidler.The   
 men wear decorated red paisley jackets
 which are over 30 years old,white     
 trousers with red stripes down the    
 sides,and a black cricket cap with    
 gold edging.The captain wears an      
 animal skin hat it is now fox fur as  
 it is made out of a discarded fur     
 coat.They all wear black clogs which  
 are iron shod.One of the dancers is a 
 clog maker which is very useful. Their
 "new"swords were presented to them in 
 1933.They are not very sharp but they 
 have been known to draw blood.The     
 Grenoside Traditional dance is        
 performed every Boxing-day at 11 am to
 celebrate the winter solstice.
