		<title>06The Common</title>
		<content> One of Studham's main attractions is  
 its large common.                     
 It is a mixture of grassy areas, gorse
 and hawthorn thickets and scattered   
 trees intersected by many footpaths.  
 The common is popular for picnics,    
 short walks, horse riding and village 
 events.                               
 Simon(Age 7) You can play hide and    
 seek and football. Last year we had a 
 mini marathon.                        
 Nicholas (Age 6) There is a May Fair  
 every year and a bonfire on Guy Fawkes
 night.                                
 Danielle (Age 6) The common has lots  
 of nature and plants.                 
 Many people visit Studham to enjoy its
 open common and an added attraction is
 the close proximity of Whipsnade Zoo  
 and Dunstable Downs.
