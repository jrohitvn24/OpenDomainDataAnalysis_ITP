		<title>02LOCAL HISTORY ERDINGTON</title>
		<content> In Anglo Saxon times Erdington was a  
 small village owned by Edwin Earl of  
 Mercia.  In 1066 William Fitzansculf  
 received Erdington.  Old street names 
 go back to Roman times, e.g. Chester  
 Road.  Station Road was once called   
 Sheep Street, Holly Lane was once a   
 footpath.  Erdington                  
 developed quickly in the nineteenth   
 century with the building of the      
 railway from Birmingham to Sutton     
 Coldfield.Many fine bridges were      
 built and Erdington became a wealthy  
 suburb.  Roman Catholicism has been   
 strong in Erdington since Irish       
 immigration but Mass was said in      
 houses until the Abbey Church was     
 founded in 1850 by Father Haigh.  In  
 1875 monks came to England from       
 Germany.  The CATHOLIC SCHOOLS began  
 in 1845.
