		<content>   Every year at Leathercote Point     
 there is a service to commemorate     
 those people who were killed in the   
 Dover Patrol during the first and     
 second World Wars.The obelisk was     
 built in 1920,then in 1921 it was     
 finally completed. It was unveiled by 
 HRH the Prince of Wales on July 27th  
 1921.The people of St.Margaret's      
 raised Â£15000 for the Memorial Fund   
 and all the names of the people who   
 lost their lives, are written in the  
 book of remembrance which is in the   
 Dover Town Hall.                      
   The memorial service has been held  
 on the Point since 1919 and each year 
 the villagers - Scouts,Guides,British 
 Legion etc.pay their respects.        
   This obelisk reminds us to remember 
 those men and women who gave their    
 lives for us in the Dover Patrol.
