		<content>We go to  Raunds St Peters CE Junior   
School and our headmaster is Mr D.     
Rockley. School starts at 8.50am each  
morning.We often do mathematics out of 
our Scottish Primary Maths Books. We   
have English nearly every day. We write
poems, stories, do handwriting practice
and spelling tests. Each day the first 
break is at 10.40am, then we have      
dinner at noon and dinner time break at
12.30pm which finishes at 1.15pm.      
Sometimes we have Environmental Studies
and Religious Education in assemblies. 
The last bell goes at hometime, which  
is at 3.30pm. In the afternoon and     
after school we have different clubs   
for guitars, choir, gym, chess and     
recorders. We have many holidays like  
half term and then we have Christmas   
holiday and Summer holiday.We also     
have our own School outing to another  
part of the Country.                   </content>
