		<title>04The River Nar</title>
		<content> The source of the river NAR is at     
 Litcham a village out of the block    
 which is approximately one KM west.The
 river is a good example of working    
{ecology}as it has an abundance of     
 wildlife and suffers from very little 
 polution.As our{landscape}gently      
 undulates so the course of the river  
 slowly meanders.The average flow of   
 the water during June 1985 was half a 
 metre per second.As it is so near the 
 source,the width of the river never   
 exceeded one and a half metres during 
 the period of observation. There have 
 been some measures taken to stop the  
 bank eroding into the river.These are 
 in the form of sandbags along the     
 river.Limited{recreation}is possibleas
 fishing licences are obtainable from  
 Lexham Hall Estate.The river is not   
 used for{communications}purposes.
