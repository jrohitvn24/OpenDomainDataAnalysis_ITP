		<title>07The Home Farm Trust.</title>
		<content>   The Home Farm Trust is a residential
 home for disabled people, and the     
 thirty one residents are mentally     
 handicapped. They live at the Home    
 under the care of a Resident Manager  
 who has the help of both full-time and
 part-time staff on a shift basis.     
   The Trust was started twenty one    
 years ago by parents, and there are   
 now nine houses.                      
   The Trust receives some financial   
 support from Local Government, but    
 fundraising is also organised.        
   The residents work in the gardens   
 and help in the house, tending        
 flowers, vegetables, and the animals. 
 Any surplus of produce is sold. They  
 have access to well-equipped craft and
 pottery studios.                      
   Small groups go on accompanied      
 holidays, sometimes overseas.
