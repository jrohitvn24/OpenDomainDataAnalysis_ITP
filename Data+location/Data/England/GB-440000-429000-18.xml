		<content> Presents for children were few, and   
 often from shops such as the penny    
 shop in Castleford. They recieced toys
 like wooden dolls, cars, fruit and    
 pennies. Christmas dinner was big and 
 mostly pork because local people often
 reaed pigs. Eggs were eaten as well,  
 as hens were kept too. Families got   
 together and children played games    
 like ludo and snakes and ladders.     
 Christmas trees were to be had, but   
 instead mistltoe and oranges and      
 apples were hung from hooks in the    
 ceiling.                              
 The hats were little Tom o Shanters.  
 Most of the people wore dark colours. 
 Childrens best clothes were           
 different, sailor suits for the boys  
 and brown velvet dresses with a white 
 pinafore for the girls they were all  
 in fashion.
