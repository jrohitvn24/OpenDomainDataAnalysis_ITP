		<title>12LIFE IN FELTHAM</title>
		<content> Feltham has a good shopping centre    
 where you can buy just about anything 
 that you want. At the centre there is 
 a Tesco's and Sainsbury'S which get   
 very busy on thursdays,fridays and    
 saturdays. There is also a Wimpy      
 hamburger restaurant where I go whem  
 my mam goes to do her shopping. There 
 is also a good toy and model shop     
 which I like to have alook in and then
 there is the library which has a lot  
 of computer games that you can play.  
 P.C. Frazer is the local police       
 officer and he comes into our school  
 to talk to us. There are plenty of    
 places to play games in Feltham       
 especially the parks with their swings
 and football pitches.                 
 There is a lot of building going on   
 and maybe by the year 2000 Feltham    
 will be a city.
