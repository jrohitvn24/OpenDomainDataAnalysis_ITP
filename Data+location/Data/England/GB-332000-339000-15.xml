		<title>15A Riding School, Erbistock</title>
		<content> The Mill House Riding School has been 
 run by a man and his wife for 22      
 years.There are 10 horses used for    
 teaching riding.There is no school    
 rink and the nearby lanes and bridle  
 paths are used for hacking.           
 Inexperienced riders are taken on a   
 lead rein. The owners have no need to 
 advertise as their clients come on    
 personal recommendation. Now that     
 the owners are in their seventies they
 run the school as a hobby rather than 
 as a business, as it once was.        
 The cost of an hour's lesson is set at
 a very competitive rate of Â£2.50 per  
 hour.                                 
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
