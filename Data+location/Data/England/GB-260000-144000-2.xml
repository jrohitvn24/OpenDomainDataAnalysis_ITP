		<content>      The Standing Stone at Vellacott  
 Lane is probably a boundary stone as  
 it stands on the boundary between     
 Combe Martin and Trentishoe.   The    
 stone has been connected with the     
 sheep stealing legend of Hangman Hill.
                                       
      The Tumulus near Long Lane farm  
 may have been part of the important   
 site on Mattocks Down.   In the 17th  
 century this site was recorded as     
 having  row of 23 standing stones but 
 by the 18th century the site had been 
 destroyed.  Unfortunately this was    
 before a scientific approach to       
 archaeology had been established so   
 its real importance may never be      
 known.
