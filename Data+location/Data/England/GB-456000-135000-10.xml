		<content>{POLICE}The Police Authority is the    
 Hampshire Constabulary. Most of the   
 area is policed by patrol car or      
 motorcycle by a constable who resides 
 in Micheldever Village. Part of the   
 area around Abbotstone Down is policed
 from a sub-station in Alresford.      
 Emergency "999" calls are routed to   
 Winchester and are dealt with by the  
 nearest mobile patrol regardless of   
 its base. Follow up action is usually 
 taken by the local constable.         
 Offenders for crimes committed in the 
 area are dealt with by the courts in  
 Winchester.
