		<title>11FARMING EGMANTON/LAXTON</title>
		<content> Most of the land in this area is used 
 for farming, with a predominance of   
 cereal crops. Other crops grown are   
 oilseed rape, sugar beet, potatoes and
 silage. A typical crop rotation works 
 ovee five years and is:_ 1st year,    
 oilseed rape, 2nd and 3rd years,      
 wheat, 4th and 5th years, barley or   
 barley and potatoes. Excluding Laxton,
 there are 12 working farms in the     
 area, plus 3 smaller specialized      
 farms; each one is worked by the      
 owners and the average size is about  
 200 acres. Unlike much of the         
 surrounding land, none has yet been   
 taken over by large concerns and the  
 field boundaries remain very much     
 unchanged. Of the 12 farms, only two  
 now keep dairy cattle, the remainder  
 being fatstock and arable, two        
 specialising in pigs and one in calf  
 rearing.                              </content>
