		<content> The{Health Centre}is at the bottom of 
 School Road.It is about 7 years old.  
{There are 2 doctors,a district nurse  
{a Health Visitor and 4 dispensers and 
{receptionists.}The doctors see their  
 patients in consulting rooms or, if   
 they are very ill, at home. There are 
 no chemist shops in the village so the
 doctors make up the medicines. The    
 nurse and Health Visitor look after   
 old and young. They often call at the 
 home.There is a small hospital in     
 Liskeard but{very ill people go to    
{Plymouth.}This makes it difficult for 
 friends to visit them. There is no    
 maternity hospital in East Cornwall so
 mothers have to go to Plymouth,       
 Tavistock or Truro.
