		<title>08ASHPERTON VILLAGE HALL</title>
		<content> The hall was built as a memorial hall 
 in 1923 on land given by the Hopton   
 family. It was built of stone with an 
 asbestos tiled roof with a kitchen for
 tea- making and washing- up.          
 Cloakrooms were added soon after. It  
 is 58ft by 24ft and 17ft high at the  
 ridge. It is heated by hot water pipes
 with electric radiators for extra     
 warmth. The hall holds 150 people and 
 has regular bookings by local groups. 
 The Women's Institute and Over 60's   
 meet monthly and the Mothers and      
 Toddlers weekly but there are also    
 dances, private parties, whist drives 
 and bingo evenings. The Parish Council
 is responsible for the appointment of 
 the committee which administers the   
 hall. Groups making the bookings look 
 after the cleaning and good order of  
 the premises.No-one seems interested  
 in holding the post of caretaker.     </content>
