		<title>02THE VILLAGE OF CADEBY</title>
		<content> Cadeby comprises an interesting       
 blend of old and new property which   
 combines to produce a most attractive 
 effect.                               
 The village itself covers an          
 area of approx. 0.15 sq.km. and is    
 surrounded by land devoted to         
 agricultural usage. The majority of   
 its 120 or so residents are not       
 however reliant upon farming for their
 income and generally commute daily to 
 their place of employment.            
                                       
 No direct bus service is provided into
 the village but connections to both   
 Hinckley and Leicester are available  
 from the nearby A447 Hinckley-Ashby   
 road.                                 
 A special school bus service is       
 provided for taking local children    
 to their places of study in either    
 Market Bosworth or Desford.           </content>
