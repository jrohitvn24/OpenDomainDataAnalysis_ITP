 Methodists hold Open Air Religious    
 Services and the one on The Dancing   
 Green aided by the Band of the        
 Hereford Salvation Army is very well  
 attended.                             
 The Lea Parish Church is the venue for
 6 Concerts during the Year when local 
 Choirs and Brass Bands with Guest     
 Soloists give a very appreciated      
 programme.
