		<title>151985 Trout Fishing Season</title>
		<content> The season is 2nd April-15th October. 
 The poor summer made conditions       
 difficult and although the total      
 (including the Barrows) of over 40,000
 is satisfactory there is no chance    
 that the Bristol Waterworks Company's 
 record catch total of 45,976, set in  
 1982, will be broken. Unfortunately,  
 only 64% of anglers send in their     
 catch records which prevents the      
 Company producing a true picture of   
 the catch. Some good-sized fish have  
 been caught, many between 5 - 10 lbs  
 and some over 12 lbs. Generally       
 speaking, the boat fishermen have been
 more successful than bank fishermen   
 though limit bags have been recorded  
 by both. A party from Leicester during
 3 days' boat fishing on the Chew      
 Valley netted 47 trout weighing 129 lb
 14oz. A fisherman from each lake has  
 qualified in Troutmaster 1985.        </content>
