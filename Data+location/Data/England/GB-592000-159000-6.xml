		<title>06LIFE AS A TRAVELLER PART 1</title>
		<content> I am a traveller named Lena Waller    
 living  in a caravan. Sometimes at    
 school I say a word that travellers   
 use &amp; they do not understand. So I    
 will tell you some - dickeye means    
 look; cacker means look, be quiet;    
 borrie means big; chavie means child; 
 chavo means boy; chave is a girl; gry 
 means horse; Jook is a dog; gaver is a
 Policeman; warrt means look &amp; kipsy is
 a basket. We have a fire outside. We  
 sometimes cook around the outside     
 fire. Travellers move quite a lot. We 
 move three times a year. In the winter
 I live in Selling and then I move to  
 Norton, Guiness Hop Farms. When the   
 hop season is over we move back to    
 Selling. Not so many Travellers visit 
 Lynsted because there isn't so much   
 work nowadays. In the morning when I  
 get up my mum &amp; dad have already gone 
 to work doing cherry picking .        </content>
