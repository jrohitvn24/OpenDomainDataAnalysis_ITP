		<title>20WORK IN BACKWELL</title>
		<content>   Most Backwellians go to work in     
 Weston and Bristol, which are the     
 neighbouring towns. Weston is a       
 seaside resort and Bristol is a large 
 industrial town.                      
   There are three ways to travel,     
 bus,train and taxi.                   
   The train fare to Bristol is Â£1.20  
 single, to Weston it is Â£1.40. The bus
 fare to Bristol is 90p return.        
   Going by car means you usually get  
 caught in the rush hour, i.e. @8.00   
 a.m. and 5.30 p.m. When you go by     
 train you have tp pay on the train    
 itself.                               
   The station is only small and you   
 have to go on an overpass to get from 
 one side of the railway to the other. 
 There is a lot of graffiti on the     
 walls of the three shelters at the    
 station.
