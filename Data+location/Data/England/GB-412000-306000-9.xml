		<title>09MY HOME LIFE!</title>
		<content>My home is great, but often a bit of a 
madhouse! I live with my Gran and      
Grandpa, Mum, Dad and sister Rachel. We
have a dog and a cat, not to mention a 
goldfish!                              
  Both my sister and I have many       
hobbies. Rachel plays the French Horn  
and Piano and is a member of various   
bands and orchestras. I play the       
Violin, Piano and Percussion. Grandpa  
is also a great Pianist, so you can    
guess that ours is not the quietest of 
households!                            
  Gran is great fun, but she does have 
her peculiarities! She adores gardening
and spends most of her time in the     
garden (don't tell anyone, but I think 
she talks to her plants!).             
  Both my parents are teachers (need I 
say more?).                            
  Life is never dull in the Madman, I  
mean Hardman! family!                  </content>
