		<content> The majority of the working{population
 who live in the Lexhams today find    
{employment}in the{farming industry.   
 Most people work on the large farms in
 the area and do not have to travel far
 from their homes for work. Even though
 the work is now largely{mechanised}it 
 is still very hard and the working day
 is very long. During certain times of 
 the year especially when harvesting of
 the various crops is underway it is   
 not uncommon for work to start at dawn
 and end at dusk. Although some cattle 
 and sheep are found in the fields,the 
 vast majority of the land is used for 
 cereal and root crops.The grain from  
 the cereal crops is usually stored in 
 large barns near or on the farms      
 themselves while some of the root     
 crops such as sugar beet are taken to 
 processing plants several miles away.
