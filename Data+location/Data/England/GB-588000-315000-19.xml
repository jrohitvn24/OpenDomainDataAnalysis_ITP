At primary and secondary school you do 
not do the same things at break.At     
primary school you play more active    
games such as Â£It'-this involves one   
person being Â£It' ,chasing the rest to 
catch one person making them Â£It'.     
Another popular game isÂ£Kiss Catch'    
this is played by boys chasing girls   
(or VV) catching  them to kiss them.   
They also have crazes at primary school
such as bouncy balls, elastic bands    
e.t.c.                                 
   At secondary school we do not play  
so many childish games because we are  
more mature and we prefer just to      
gossip and complain about our homework!
