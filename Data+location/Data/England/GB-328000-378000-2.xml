		<title>02NESTON RECREATION CENTRE</title>
		<content>   A class of{35}children from Parkgate
 School asked their{parents}to answer a
{leisure survey.}They discovered that  
{Neston Recreation Centre}is used      
 regularly by 15, occasionally 15 and  
 never 5. It is used more than once a  
 week by 11, once a week by 7, once a  
 month by 11 and less than once a month
 by 1.                                 
   At the centre{20}follow their own   
 sport{(half of them are swimmers)}and 
 14 follow run courses. There are 14   
 people who belong to another sport or 
 an art's club.                        
{  Varied comments}were made about the 
 centre. It was voted excellent by 1,  
 very good 8, good 10, quite good 4,   
 all right 5 and not very good 2.      
  {26 people}think Neston Recreation   
 Centre{could be improved}with a{larger
{pool, more spectator space}and a      
{bigger car park.                      </content>
