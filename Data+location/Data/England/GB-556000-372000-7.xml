		<content> In 1870 a lifeboat called "The        
 Godsend" was presented by Lady        
 Bourchier, the daughter of Sir E.     
 Codrington. Alifeboat house was built 
 where Stow's Stores now stands, and a 
 pullover cut through the sandhills.   
 Later "The Godsend" was replaced by   
 the "Landseer" presented by the sister
 of the famous artist.                 
 The need for a lifeboat was soon      
 proved for on Good Friday 1876 a      
 fearful storm blew up and three ships 
 went aground. They were the "Don      
 Antonio",a steamer from Lisbon,       
 "Naomi", from Sunderland, and "Thorney
 Close", from Hartlepool.              
 Today the nearest lifeboat is at      
 Skegness.
