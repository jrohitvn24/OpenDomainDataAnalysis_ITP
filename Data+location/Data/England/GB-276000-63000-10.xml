		<title>10The Staverton Cricket Club</title>
		<content> The Club was formed in 1983 by a few  
 local people who wanted to revive the 
 game in the village.A Committee was   
 elected and some friendly games       
 arranged with local organisations like
 Staverton Builders and the Round      
 Table.                                
       In 1985 there were 24 fixtures  
 arranged .Some were rained off in the 
 worst July and August in living       
 memory. However the 36 playing members
 and the 34 non-playing members enjoyed
 the sound of leather on willow on a   
 number of quiet summer evenings.      
        Although the cricket was often 
 entertaining and the friendly rivalry 
 very evident the main purpose of the  
 evening seems to be the adjournment to
 the local pub where there is much     
 recounting of near misses,drinking of 
 the local brew, and hearing the       
 current gossip.                       </content>
