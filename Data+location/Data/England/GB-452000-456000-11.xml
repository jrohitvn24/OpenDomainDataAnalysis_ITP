		<title>11   The A19 (Shipton).</title>
		<content> We surveyed the A19 for ten minutes   
 every half hour to see how many       
 vehicles used it.We found averages for
 all the vehicles.These are the        
 results{10 hours  = 5400 vehicles     
         {1 hour   =  540 vehicles     
         {1 minute =    9 vehicles     
 50 years ago about 1 vehicle would go 
 past in 2-3 hours.Our results show    
 what a busy road it is now.           
 Mrs Savage is the schools crossing    
 patrol or lolly pop lady.Her uniform  
 is white with yellow strips.When she  
 started 23 years ago the speed limit  
 was 30mph but now it is 40mph.She     
 doesn't think the road is adequate for
 the amount of traffic using it now.   
 Many villagers think the A19 should be
 by-passed.Nearly all the people say   
 there are too many accidents on the   
 A19 and a crossing should be there to 
 help children and old people cross.   </content>
