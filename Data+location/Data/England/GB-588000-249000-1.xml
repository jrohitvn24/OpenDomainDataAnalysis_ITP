		<content> Lavenham is a medieval village in the 
county of Suffolk which is world famous
for its many old half-timbered         
buildings. It is set amidst open gently
rolling countryside which is mainly    
devoted to cereals. Lavenham is        
situated on the A1141 Hadleigh to Bury 
St.Edmunds road,approximately 12 km    
NW of Hadleigh and 15 km S of Bury. Her
nearest neighbour of any size is       
Sudbury,which is 10 km to the south.   
Lavenham was once the centre of the    
East-Anglian wool trade and became     
wealthy because of the high quality    
of its fine Broad-cloth - dyed with    
Lavenham woad. The decline of the      
woollen trade saw the introduction of  
rope making and sisal and jute         
processing which in their turn have    
been replaced by printing and cosmetic 
manufacture.Of course the main source  
of income is now the tourist industry .</content>
