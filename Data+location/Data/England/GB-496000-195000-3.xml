		<content> Games me and my brother play are what 
 we usually make up ourselves.  One    
 game we play is called "Hit Below the 
 Shoulders". One person is bowling and 
 another has a bat. When the person    
 throws the ball, the person with the  
 bat has got to try to defend          
 him/herself with the bat.  If the ball
 hits below the shoulders the person is
 out. But if the person hits the ball  
 with the bat then him/her has got to  
 try and get as many runs as they can  
 get. When the bowler gets the ball    
 he's got to try and get the person out
 by hitting below the knee.The         
 favourite games in school are         
 football, skipping,"hot chocolate",   
 climbing frame and "it".We also play  
 polo, hot scotch (sic), bulldog,      
 rotten eggs, black poison and "In and 
 out the bluebells".
