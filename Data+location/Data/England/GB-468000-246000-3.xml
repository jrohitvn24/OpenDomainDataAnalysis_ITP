		<content>{juvenile room.}The male cells are very
 plain. They have a toilet and a       
 single window. The window has         
 three inch glass in it which is       
 reinforced with concrete criss-cross  
 bars.                                 
                                       
     There is a hard bed, a light in   
 the wall and there is a 'call' button 
 if the prisoner wants anything.The    
 police force in Towcester have a      
 supply of mattresses. This is because 
 the beds are hard and wooden like in  
 the juvenile room. The people who are 
 put in the cells are not allowed      
 belts, shoe laces and other similar   
 things because they can scratch on the
 walls or hang themselves. The         
 Magistrates in Towcester cannot handle
 very serious cases, so these go the   
 Northampton court.
