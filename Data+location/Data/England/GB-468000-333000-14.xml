		<content> .The  Fields  are  green and yellow in
 the Spring and Summer but are brown { 
 in the Winter.Oil-seed rape  and corn 
 and wheat are grown in the fields.    
 I have seen lots of daisies,buttercups
 and dandelions , and cowslips in the  
 fields.                               
   There are three shops in Cropwell   
 Bishop, the Post Office,the Co-op and 
 the Grocery shop. There are also two  
 public houses, The Chequers and The   
 Wheatwheaf.                           
   There are two village teams, a      
 football club and a cricket club.     
 There used to be{Men's Institute,}with
 their headquarters at the Memorial    
 Hall, playing cribbage, snooker,      
 billiards,etc. against other villages 
 in the area, but this ceased in the   
 late 1960's, although the billiard    
 table is still present in the Hall.   
 The{Women's Institute}is still active.</content>
