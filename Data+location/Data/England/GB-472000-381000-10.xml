		<content>{Clarborough}is the most densely       
 populated part of the survey area.The 
 village is divided by the busy A 620  
 road into two fairly distinct         
 parts.The eastern side of the A 620 is
 the oldest part of the village with   
 St.John the Baptist's Church,the Old  
 Vicarage,the Junior School and many   
 properties dating back over the       
 centuries.                            
 The western part of the village is    
 comparatively new,with the main       
 housing development being only about  
 fifteen to twenty years old.          
{                                      
{Little Gringley}is still little more  
 than a hamlet.Farmhouses and a few    
 more modern bungalows and houses make 
 up this tiny village, which is reached
 by a quiet country road.
