		<content>     Communications  are  available  by
 telephone and post.   Most houses have
 telephones carried by  overhead wires,
 paid for by  quarterly rental and user
 charges.   Post is delivered  daily by
 post office van;   there  is  no  post
 office.    Letter boxes are emptied by
 GPO van  twice  daily,   but  once  on
 Saturday and not on Sunday. South east
 of the  village  is a television relay
 mast.    National and local newspapers
 can be delivered daily.   There  is  a
 local evening paper.                  
 The Citizens Band radio is made use of
 quite  widely  especially  in  farming
 activity.
