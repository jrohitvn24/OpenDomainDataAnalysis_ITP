		<title>01Sellindge,the general area.</title>
		<content> Our area is mostly countryside.It is  
 in East Kent,between Folkestone and   
 Ashford.There is a lot of farm land   
 and two smallish villages called      
 Brabourne Lees and Sellindge.Sellindge
 appeared in the first Domesday Book   
 when it was known as"Sedlinges".There 
 are many open fields in the area which
 are used for grazing or growing crops.
 The population is mainly old people,  
 because they retire and come out of   
 the big city.There are some woods and 
 lots of brooks.The main attraction of 
 the villages are the historical parts.
 The village of Sellindge has a railway
 line running through it but there is  
 no station.The main road from         
 Folkestone to London also goes through
 the village.There are lots of farms   
 scattered around and there are lots of
 little lanes and fields with small    
 streams running through them.         </content>
