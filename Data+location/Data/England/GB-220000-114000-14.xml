		<content> There  are  now many  rabbits on  most
 farms.  Their  disappearance  due   to
 myxomatosis probably caused the  Large
 Blue  butterfly's  extinction as cliff
 grasses grew longer and coarser. These
 are  to  be   re-introduced  from  the
 Continent  shortly  and  stand  a good
 chance of colonising the area again.  
 Foxes are plentiful,  and even seen in
 farmyards. Badgers have been gassed by
 the Ministry of Agriculture trying  to
 eradicate  T. B.  in  cattle but still
 many may be seen, also mink, hares and
 the occasional otter.                 
 Deer from Hartland Abbey cross  cliff-
 top farms.                            
 Birds include buzzards, kestrel, heron
 and mallards. barn owls and bats roost
 by day in the old houses nad buildings
 and fly by night  over  the  farmyards
 and fields.  There  are  35 species of
 butterfly and 13 of dragonfly.        </content>
