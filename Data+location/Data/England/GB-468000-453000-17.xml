		<title>17Religion in Stamford Bridge</title>
		<content> In Stamford Bridge we have the Church 
 of England,the Methodist Chapel and   
 the church at Low Catton.The church in
 the village was built in 1857 and the 
 one in Low Catton dates back to the   
 13th Century.The Methodist church is  
 on Main Street.Sunday School meets in 
 the Chapel school-room at 10.40am.The 
 Church of England's Sunday School     
 meets in a room at the Primary School.
 We learn stories from the bible and   
 about the life of Jesus.Dr.Bailes is  
 the vicar for both the churches in the
 village and Low Catton.The Chapel has 
 a different vicar each week.At Harvest
 time all the churches display bread,  
 wheat and other produce donated by the
 villagers.These are given to the old  
 people after the service.At the       
 Christmas service the children are    
 allowed to build a model of the       
 Nativity during the service.          </content>
