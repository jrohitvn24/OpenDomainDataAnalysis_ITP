		<title>08RAIL SERVICE - BROUGH</title>
		<content> Brough is a main line station serving 
 a large area of North Humberside. It  
 was  opened in 1840 as a 2_line track,
 expanded to a 4_line, but has now     
 reverted to 2 lines.  Out of 9l0      
 passenger trains passing through      
 daily, only one train does not stop.  
 There is now little freight transport 
 _ approximately 10 goods trains daily.
 The former coal and freight depot     
 adjoining Brough station has been     
 closed down. 50% of the total weekly  
 revenue, that is approximately Â£6,000,
 comes from workers commuting to       
 British Aerospace.  Special trains    
 carry workers from Hull to Brough and 
 then go no further.  From the         
 opposite direction, trains bring in   
 workers, whose places are refilled at 
 Brough by passengers going to work in 
 Hull.  There is one manually operated 
 signal box, also a level crossing.    </content>
