		<content> As there is no public transport in the
 area now, apart from the railway      
 station at Amberley, most families are
 dependant on their car for getting to 
 work, shopping and visiting family and
 friends.                              
 Children are taken to school by bus or
 by their parents in cars.             
 A few people use bicycles for local   
 visits but those without cars use the 
 community mini bus to take them into  
 the nearby town of Storrington for    
 shopping. From there it is possible to
 get a bus into the larger towns of    
 Worthing and Chichester.              
 Trains run from Amberley Station or   
 Pulborough, to and from London but    
 cross country journeys can be achieved
 with some difficulty.
