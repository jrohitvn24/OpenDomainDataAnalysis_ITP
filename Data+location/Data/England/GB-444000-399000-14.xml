		<content> Agriculture in the local area is now  
 no longer as important as it was      
 previously.  The majority of the farms
 are now reduced to small scale        
 intensive farming which providefood   
 mainly on a subsistance basis.A few   
 farms towards Adwick Upon Dearne farm 
 extensively growing mainly wheat and  
 barley for sale to local markets.     
 Market gardening is also quite popular
 and many allotments can be found      
 around Swinton and Mexborough.
