		<content> Apart from Winter Hill mast the most  
 dominating feature in our area is the 
 squat tower atop the knoll at the head
 of Rivington Pike.                    
 The hill itself is a harder kernal of 
 rock pushing its way above the beneral
 level of the gritstone moorland to a  
 height of 361 metres. Local tradition 
 believes that this could well have    
 been one of the many beacon hills     
 which was prepared for use at the time
 of the Armarda.                       
 The local gentry at Rivington Hall in 
 the eighteenth century were the       
 Andrews family and it seems that they 
 hunted on the moors like many folk    
 before them.                          
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
