 My memories of school are very happy. 
 The school was unusual because it was 
 inside two large houses.One at the top
 and the other half way down a steep   
 hill.It was necessary to go from one  
 to the other for lessons  and in the  
 W inter you had to struggle up or     
 slide down to school.Sliding down was 
 best.We sat on wooden benches two at a
 desk,one girl and one boy at each.How_
 ever during the Winter coal fires were
 lit and we could all gather near the  
 heat for our lessons.During games     
 lessons you had to climb throughthe   
 treesand swing from the branches. when
 Autumn came we were allowed to pick as
 many pears as we wanted if we asked   
 first.Any pupil could have a small    
 plot of landto grow flowers and       
 vegtables.Sadly the school no longer  
 exists but it always in my memory.....</content>
