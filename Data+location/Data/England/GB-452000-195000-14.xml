		<title>14CHILDREN IN CLIFTON HAMPDEN</title>
		<content>   There is  a marked  absence of young
 families  in  the  village.  Fifteen  
 children  attend the  pre-school play-
 group but only  four of these actually
 live  in  Clifton  Hampden. These four
 are  the  only  children in the 3 to 5
 years ge group living in the village. 
                                       
   The  primary  school  is  small with
 only  one  full time  teacher and some
 part time  helpers. There are about 20
 children  on the roll. The headteacher
 from the school is  on  sabbatical for
 the 1984-85  school year. He is a firm
 believer  in  the  advantages  of  the
 small rural  school  and is  using the
 year to  study the ways in which small
 schools function.                     
                                       
   Many  of the  older  children  go to
 independent schools, others attend the
 comprehensive school in Berinsfield.  </content>
