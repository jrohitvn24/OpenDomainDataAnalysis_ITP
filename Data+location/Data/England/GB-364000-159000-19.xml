		<title>19LIFE STYLES IN TIMSBURY</title>
		<content>   Local people were asked about their 
 lifestyle.The most popular form of    
 heating in houses was coal.Oil was    
 less used.Gas and electricity were    
 equally popular.                      
      Elderly people shop in the       
 village,but middle-aged people tend to
 go to Bath,Midsomer Norton or         
 Keynsham. Supermarkets are very       
 popular,but not hypermarkets. Again,  
 elderly people have their hair done   
 either in the village,or have someone 
 come to their home to do it. Some     
 people do their own hair,or even      
 go into town to have it done.         
       Most people were not born       
 here.All but one liked living here.   
       Left-handed people seem to be   
 less popular than right-handed.The    
 people I interviewed were only keen on
 the one sport of swimming.
