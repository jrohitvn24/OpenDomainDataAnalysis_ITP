		<title>07FARMING IN PARTNEY</title>
		<content> On my farm we have 5 tractors.Tractors
 are very powerful machines that pull  
 things.We have 3 workers.My Uncle     
 John, his son Martin and my Dad.My    
 farm is small. We have 11 sheds and my
 house.                                
 We rear sheep and cows.In the spring  
 we are very busy with the sheep       
 because they are lambing.Our main     
 crops are sugar beat,wheat,barley,    
 potatoes and peas.In August we        
 harvest some of the crops mainly wheat
 and barley. In Autumn we harvest the  
 potatoes,peas and sugar beat. In      
 Summer my Dad reaps the grass to make 
 hay to feed the animals in the Winter 
 because there is no grass for them to 
 eat.
