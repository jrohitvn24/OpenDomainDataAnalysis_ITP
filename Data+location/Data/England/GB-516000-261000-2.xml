 the war torn towns.                   
   In 1086 the Abbots of the Priory at 
 St. Neots were granted a charter      
 allowing them to build a watermill for
 milling flour.The site is still in use
 as a mill but now produces  glued     
 paper products.                       
   Although the mill provides          
 employment for many in the village    
 more find work outside the immediate  
 area. This maybe because of relative  
 cheap housing ,pleasant surroundings, 
 and good road and rail facilities for 
 travel to and from work.              
   The population is "young" and most  
 of the parents have children at the   
 Primary school.Those pupils requiring 
 secondary and higher education have to
 travel out of the village to receive  
 an education.                         </content>
