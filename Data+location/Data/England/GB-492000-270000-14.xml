		<content>    In 1961, a new secondary school    
was built in Finedon Road which took   
children from Irthlingborough, Finedon 
and other surrounding villages. This   
school became Huxlow Comprehensive     
School in 1976. Huxlow School is a     
county co-educational day school. The  
school is situated on the edge of the  
town, some 100 metres off the main A6  
road. It has been extended many times. 
A Humanities block was added in 1977,  
new specialist rooms for dance and     
drama, music and art and fabrics were  
built during 1978. The last additions  
are a Sixth Form Suite and extended    
Science and Craft facilities in 1982.  
Since 1980, there has been a full      
comprehensive range of pupils          
throughout the main school and Advanced
Level courses have been established in 
a range of subjects.
