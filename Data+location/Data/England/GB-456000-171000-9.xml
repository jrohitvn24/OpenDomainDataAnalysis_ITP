		<content> The area, typical of many small       
 communities in rural Britain, lacks a 
 great many services and amenities,    
 although rates are lower than in      
 towns. Refuse collection by the       
 Council is now carried out through    
 means of large 1.5 metre high plastic 
 bins which speed up one-weekly        
 collections. There is a small Doctor's
 practise ( with two G.Ps ) about 4    
 miles from{Stanford Dingley.}The      
 nearest{hospital}is 10 miles away.    
 There is a{vetinery practice}at{Tutt's
{Clump}which serves a wide area. A     
 mobile{Blacksmith}meets the need of   
 the numerous small-time horse owners  
 and commercial stables in the area.
