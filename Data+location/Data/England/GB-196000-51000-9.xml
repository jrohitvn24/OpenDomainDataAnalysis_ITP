		<title>09Lanjeth Memorial Hall</title>
		<content> The "village" owns the hall.It was    
 built with funds and a grant collected
 in memory of the soldiers who died    
 during the 1st World War.The caretaker
 has the key for the hall and lives in 
 Lanjeth.The village hall is used for  
 quite a lot of things such as keep-fit
 classes, Youth Clubs, Bingo, Whist    
 Drives, Private Hire and coffee       
 mornings.The hall is also used for    
 receptions. They sometimes have band  
 concerts but they are only open to the
 people who live in Lanjeth.It is also 
 used for luncheon clubs for the       
 elderly people. The hall is very      
 important to the local community. It  
 gives them the opportunity to meet    
 each other and organise events for all
 the family to enjoy. Sometimes people 
 enjoy getting together for a chat over
 a cup of coffee.
