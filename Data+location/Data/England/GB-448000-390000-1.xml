		<title>01Bramley Area_general comment</title>
		<content>{ Our 12 sq.km.area is neatly divided  
{by its transport system.}The M18      
 motorway cuts it in half, North to    
 South, while the A631, a dual         
 carriageway, runs across its East_West
 axis.                                 
  In the mid 1950s the outskirts of    
 Rotherham lead west to Wickersley and,
 then, the village of Bramley. Farmland
 covered the central area westwards    
 toward Maltby. Today there is Hellaby,
 the Industrial estate, and development
 of large estates, towards the motorway
 from both the Maltby and Bramley      
 side.{In 1985 its about 60% farmland. 
  We went on a walk around Bramley.    
 There are lots of shops and pubs.We   
 saw 3 pubs, one called the Travellers,
 one called the Ball Inn and the other 
 one called the Joker.In Bramley there 
 are lots of phone boxes and post boxes
 I think it is a nice place to live.   </content>
