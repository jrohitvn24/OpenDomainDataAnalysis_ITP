		<title>20ENTERTAINMENT IN WINCANTON 2</title>
		<content> "Beside the river Cale we have a      
{recreation ground,}an adventure       
 playground and a field for cricket and
 games. Some children play on the      
 Primary School field.Wincanton has its
 own{football team}and its own ground. 
 My Dad used to be manager of the first
 team, but is now secretary."          
 "My Mum is secretary of the{swimming  
 club. Unfortunately Wincanton has not 
 got an indoor heated pool so the club 
 hires Sherborne School's pool. In the 
 Summer we use the training pool       
 outside Cale House or King Arthurs    
 School pool. The deep end of this has 
 just been filled in so it's too       
 shallow to dive or jump in."          
{"Wincanton Silver band's}practice room
 is beside the old railway. We rehearse
 on Saturdays and Wednesdays."         
  "I am a{bellringer.}The Parish church
 tower needs Â£30 000 for restoration." </content>
