		<title>04WHERE TO GO IN FLEETWOOD.</title>
		<content>   Any visitor to Fleetwood will notice
 its fine, wide streets. Worth noting, 
 too, are their names. In this block   
 alone, 6 are named for local rivers, 4
 for lakes, 6 for connections with     
 royalty, 7 for poets and 15 for       
 characters or places in the plays of  
 Shakespeare,who of course has a street
 named after him. The purely decorative
  light-house is classically named the 
 Pharos. These names illustrate the    
 care with which the town was planned. 
   Marine and civil engineers will want
 to visit the docks, ferry and{Maritime
{Museum}and travel on one of the       
 country's few remaining tram systems; 
 sports-lovers will want to visit the  
{Marine Hall, Lake Complex}and{Leisure 
{Centre}; shoppers will want to visit  
{Fleetwood Market}and{Lord Street}and  
 everyone will want to visit the little
 gem of Fleetwood, the{Memorial Park}. </content>
