 The deputy head doesn't think that the
educational funds in London are too    
low.However the school has no space    
for Home Economics facilities and the  
school gym isn't in very good          
condition.Also the boys'take a coach   
to the playing fields in Edgware.      
  "O" and "A" level results are very   
good and almost as good as in private  
schools which have a selective entry,  
that is,they take pupils of the highest
ability.31 % of the pupils obtained    
5 or more "O" levels.                  
  We interviewed two 4th Year boys     
(15 years old) .School for them starts 
at 8.50 am. and ends at 3.20 pm.There  
are two breaks,20 minutes nid-morning  
and one hour at lunchtime.They usually 
were given homework taking 1-3 hours.
