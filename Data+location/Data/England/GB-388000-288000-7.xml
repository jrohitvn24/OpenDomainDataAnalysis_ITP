		<content>{The Health Centre}was built in{1975}on
 the corner of Standhills Road and High
 Street.It helps everybody in this     
 area, from OAPs to babies.At least    
 14,000 people visit the Centre because
 of all the services it provides, such 
 as Doctors, Dentists, Health Visitors,
 Speech Therapists, Opticians and      
 Chiropodists.In all, about 30 people  
 work at the Centre. Some of these     
 people make frequent visits to        
 patients' homes,particularly to the   
 very young and very old.              
{Health}in this area is improving. One 
 reason is that the Health Centre is   
 convenient for many people and        
 secondly there is no pollution because
 there are few factories in the area.  
 Also there is less smoking and more   
 open space.Today in Kingswinford the  
 most serious illness for adults is    
{heart disease}&amp; for children{measles.}</content>
