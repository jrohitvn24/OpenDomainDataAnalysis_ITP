St. Michael and All Angels Church      
dates from the 12th century.  The      
building's fabric is in excellent      
condition.  Adbaston is now a member   
of the United Benefice of Croxton with 
Broughton and Adbaston with the Rev.W. 
E. Foster M.A. as its first vicar.     
There are 14 members of the P.C.C. and 
57 names on the  Electoral Roll. There 
is an active Mothers' Union branch and 
a lively   Sunday School attended by   
30 children.                           
The church supports charities at home  
and abroad, and educates a girl in     
Lesotho. Services are not very well    
attended, except on special Festivals. 
2 C.of E. sevices are held each month  
in Offley Hay Village Hall.            
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
