      I start the day by getting up and
 having a bath.  I have cornflakes and 
 a cup of coffee.  I leave the house at
 8.5O am. I walk to school with some   
 friends. When we arrive we play until 
 the bell rings then we run into line. 
      In the classroom our teacher     
 calls the register.  We go into the   
 Hall for assembly.  We talk about God 
 and sing songs.  After assembly we    
 have Mathematics.  At 1O.3O am we get 
 our milk before we go out to play.  We
 play a game called "Cats got the      
 Measles".  After playtime we have     
 English.  At 12.OO we go for our      
 dinners.  We play again until the bell
 rings.  We work until playtime and    
 then we have a story.  We then get    
 our coats and go home at 3.3O pm.
