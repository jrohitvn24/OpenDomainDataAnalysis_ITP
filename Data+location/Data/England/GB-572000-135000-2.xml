		<title>02Goudhurst Village Festival 1</title>
		<content>The Festival held annually in July has 
a two-fold purpose. 1, to bring        
friends   and families together in a   
variety of events held in and around   
the village. 2, to raise funds for     
St.Mary's church. In l985 the aim was  
to raise as much as possible towards   
the thirty thousand pounds required to 
repair the church roof. The Vicar was  
the central figure of Festival week. He
sought to bring St. Mary's close not   
only to his parishioners but to        
everyone living in, or visiting        
Goudhurst. Hence breakfast in the      
church followed by a family service,   
and later a family communion. The      
church tower was open all week and the 
exhibition "The way of a Christian"    
inside the church was received the     
admiration it deserved.
