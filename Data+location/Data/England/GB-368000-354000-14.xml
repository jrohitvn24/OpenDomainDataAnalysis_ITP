		<title>14M6 LINK, CREWE</title>
		<content> A road link to the M6 motorway from   
 Crewe, first planned in 1959, is to be
 built 4-7 miles in length from the    
 roundabout near Crewe station to      
 junction 16 of the motorway. It will  
 cost approximately Â£10 million. Of    
 three proposed routes the most        
 northerly has been chosen. 68 acres of
 prime farming land will be used. No   
 buildings need to be demolished. Work 
 will begin in September 1985 and will 
 take 18 months to complete. The       
 journey from Crewe to the motorway    
 will take 5 minutes instead of the    
 present 20 minutes. It will take heavy
 traffic away from villages and off    
 minor roads. At the same time  link to
 the M6 is to be provides from the     
 Royal Ordnance Factory at Radway      
 Green.
