<title>22A day in the life</title>
<content>

Last Saturday I went to the school fair I played coconut shy. There were six coconuts on some metal poles you needed to knock the coconuts off with a wooden ball. If you knock them off,  you got to drink what is inside them, which is milk.&lt;br />&lt;br />I also played spin the arrow you needed to pick a number between 1 and 10 then spin the arrow and make it land on that number you picked.  If it landed on that number you got an air  floater. &lt;br />&lt;br />I played throw the toilet paper in the toilet, if you won you got a prize which was a whistle and a sweet.&lt;br />&lt;br />Also I played crossbar challenge if you hit the crossbar once you got a brand new football if you hit it again you win some goalie gloves.&lt;br />&lt;br />We played the raffle and we picked a number if it got called out you go and pick a drink.   &lt;br />&lt;br />   &lt;br />
