   Littondale is an offshoot of        
 Wharfedale in the Yorkshire Dales     
 National Park.  It is a U-shaped      
 valley, about eight miles long, down  
 which the River Skirfare flows to     
 join the Wharfe.                      
   The valley bottom is mainly meadow  
 and pasture, which gives way to rough 
 grazing.  Above the grazing are       
 escarpments, typical of limestone     
 country.  Beyond the escarpments are  
 the moor tops, some of which are      
 covered with heather.                 
   Sheltering in the valley bottom are 
 five villages.  Hawkswick is the      
 first at the eastern end of the Dale, 
 then Arncliffe some three and a half  
 miles and Litton some five and a half 
 miles up the Dale.  At the top end of 
 the Dale are the villages of Halton   
 Gill and Foxup.                       </content>
