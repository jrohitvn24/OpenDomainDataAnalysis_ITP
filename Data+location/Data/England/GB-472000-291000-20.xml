		<content>   Colonel Hignett was in the army for 
 26 years and travelled to many        
 countries.He has lived at The Grange, 
 East Langton for 51 years.The Grange  
 has 18 bedrooms and is expensive to   
 heat.His favourite room is the        
 "snuggery".There are three and a half 
 acres and he hates gardening!He used  
 to be co-driver of a racing car and   
 has a maintainance workshop.He has a  
 Queen Anne cupboard with a secret     
 compartment.He has 3 cars:a Rolls     
 Royce,a Humber and a Land Rover.He    
 used to be Master of the Fernie Hunt. 
   The Langtons have changed since he  
 was young.More mechanical farming has 
 meant that men who worked on the land 
 have left and town people have moved  
 into the village.The Colonel has just 
 applied for planning permission to    
 convert the stables and outbuildings  
 into 8 dwellings.                     </content>
