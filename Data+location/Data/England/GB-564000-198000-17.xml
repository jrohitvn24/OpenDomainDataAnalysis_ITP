		<title>17Ingatestone - shopping.</title>
		<content> Ingatestone is a low-to-middle order  
 shopping centre. The shops are largely
 located along the High Street. There  
 is a good variety of food shops       
 including three butchers, two bakers  
 and two greengrocers. There are three 
 general food shops the largest of     
 which may be classified as a small    
 supermarket. There is no large        
 supermarket - people of the area often
 do their main weekly food shopping    
 elsewhere e.g. Chelmsford.            
 For the size of the village there is a
 remarkable variety of non-food shops  
 and many of these are of a specialised
 nature providing high quality (and    
 high price) goods. Examples are       
 antique shops, a saddlery, jewellers  
 and china and glass shops. The        
 existence of such shops again reflects
 the relatively affluent nature of the 
 area.                                 </content>
