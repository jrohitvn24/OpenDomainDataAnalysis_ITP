		<title>17 SPEEDWAY STADIUM - WEST ROW</title>
		<content>                                       
    THE SPEEDWAY STADIUM AT WEST ROW IS
THE HOME OF THE MILDENHALL FEN TIGERS, 
WHO COMPETE IN THE NATIONAL LEAGUE.    
    WITH GATES OF AROUND 1500, FEN     
TIGERS HAVE STEADY LOCAL SUPPORT.THEIR 
FINEST HOUR WAS IN 1979 WHEN THEY WON  
THE LEAGUE. THEIR BIGGEST GATE WAS IN  
THE SAME YEAR - 10,000 - WHEN THEY     
ENTERTAINED RYE HOUSE.                 
    THE SPEEDWAY EVOLVED FROM HUMBLE   
BEGINNINGS 13 YEARS AGO. A GROUP OF    
ENTHUSIASTS, AIDED BY THE SYMPATHETIC  
FARMER, TURNED A FIELD INTO A TRACK BY 
LAYING A CHALK FOUNDATION. GRADUALLY   
OVER THE YEARS, THE BANKING WAS BUILT  
UP AND BARS, CHANGING-ROOMS, STANDS,   
OFFICES, AND A CHILDREN'S PLAY AREA    
WERE ADDED.                            
    NOW THE STADIUM ALSO CATERS FOR    
STOCK CAR RACING, AND SOCIAL FUNCTIONS 
OF ALL KINDS ARE HELD IN THE BALLROOM. </content>
