		<title>04THE CHURCH IN EAST MERSEA</title>
		<content>   St. Edmunds church is built of local
 flint and is situated in Church Lane. 
 It is 600 years old and it took 200   
 years to build. It was originally a   
 Catholic church but now it is Church  
 of England. During the Catholic period
 a tower was built with 5 bells but now
 only one remains. The door to the     
 tower is unusual in having three      
 locks. It is thought locally that it  
 was used for smugglins in the 17th.   
 century as the three keys were held by
 different people.                     
   The church is well maintained with a
 large stained-glass window above the  
 altar. The family box-pews have been  
 replaced by chairs made by a local    
 craftsman which can seat up to 80     
 people.                               
   There is a church service every     
 Sunday at 9.30 and the average        
 congregation is 35.                   </content>
