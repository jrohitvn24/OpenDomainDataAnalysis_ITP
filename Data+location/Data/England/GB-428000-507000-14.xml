		<title>14DALTON VILLAGE HALL.</title>
		<content>  The Hall belongs to the Church       
 Council, but is leased to the Village 
 Hall Committee for 99 years at Â£5.00  
 per year rent.                        
   Originally the Hall was the local   
 school house but became a dwelling    
 house. After the Second World War it  
 was converted into a Hall, where      
 Communion was held monthly, and where 
 other local activities took place.    
   Now the Hall is used by the W.I. for
 their monthly meetings on the first   
 Tuesday in the month. There are       
 Parish Council meetings held in the   
 Hall once every two months.           
   Each year a Harvest Festival is held
 there, and a Carol Service is arranged
 each Christmas by the Tidy Village    
 Committee. The Hall is also used for  
 childrens' parties, and by a musical  
 group for rehearsals.
