		<title>11SHARESHILL CHURCH - HISTORY</title>
		<content>Shareshill parish church according to  
tradition,should have been built on    
Saredon Hill.Legend says that the      
church was started,but whatever work   
was done in the day was pulled down at 
night by pixies living in the nearby   
woods,who removed the stones to their  
present site.A church has existed in   
the village since l2l3,the present     
building dates from l743.The total cost
of building the church was 644.lls.lld.
and was raised by church briefs and    
voluntary gifts.During renovations in  
l965 old paintings were found under the
plaster on the west wall,the earliest  
being l4th century,also part of a l7th 
century painting executed in tempora on
limewash.Unfortunately due to the      
dangerous condition of the wall the    
paintings had to be covered.
