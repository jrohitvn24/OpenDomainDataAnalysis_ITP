		<title>10A LEONS BUS DRIVERS DAY</title>
		<content> "I usually get up at 6.00am and I'm at
 work by 7.45am. My first job is{school
{ contract}work, starting at Doncaster 
 and travel through the villages to    
 Auckley. After this I go back to the  
 garage and start{cleaning}the buses,  
 washing outside and vacuuming the     
 inside. Any mechanical jobs are done  
 by the mechanics. At lunchtime I'm on 
 school runs again and at present am   
 out every lunchtime. After my lunch I 
 finish off the cleaning then at about 
 3.45pm its back onto school contracts.
 This is a basic day, others might     
 include an{excursion}to Scarbourgh or 
 Derbyshire anywhere really. I don't   
 usually find out until about 4.00pm   
 what I'm doing the next day except for
 Bank Holidays when I know in advance. 
 Normally I can be{out}of the garage   
 from{9.00am-9.00pm}but on excursion it
 can be more".                         </content>
