    Baden Powell was a famous Army     
 Scout, his most exciting adventures   
 happened in Africa when he matched his
 wits against ferocious natives. They  
 called him "Impeesa"-'The wolf who    
 does not sleep'. His job was the      
 training of army scouts. He found that
 the men enjoyed it and became better  
 men for it. So he thought that boys   
 should have the fun of being a scout. 
 So he started the scouting movement.  
 The first camp  was at Brownsea Island
 in 1907. Now, in 1985, scouting is    
 still popular, but on a greater scale.
 Troups of scouts often go camping in  
 the holidays. They meet once a week,  
 have sports, games and competitions   
 and enjoy themselves. They take part  
 in church parades and learn to serve  
 the community.                        </content>
