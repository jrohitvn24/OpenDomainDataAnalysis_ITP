		<content> Mr and Mrs Coupland have lived in     
 Peacehaven since 1937.                
 Mr Coupland talked about the tidal    
 wave at the Bastion Steps in the early
 1950's.Some people were swept into the
 sea causing the deaths of a few       
 people.                               
 They told how a lot of children were  
 evacuated to Canada by boat during the
 war.Mrs Coupland said that her        
 neighbour's children were evacuated.  
 Where the Meridian Centre now stands  
 was afavourite place to have a picnic 
 and to pick blackberries.             
 The cliffs at Peacehaven used to be   
 full of small indentations and covered
 in daffodils but to combat erosion    
 they were straightened and all the    
 daffodils lost.
