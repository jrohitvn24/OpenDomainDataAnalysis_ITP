		<content>{FRINTON ON SEA}is a small seaside town
 in North-East Essex. It caters for    
 both local residents and holiday      
 makers,many of whom come with their   
 families. Frinton also has a high     
 proportion of elderly and wealthy     
 residents and the shopping facilities 
 reflect this.                         
 Frinton developed after 1886 when the 
 railway atation was built. Before this
 time there were few houses for a      
 population of thirty. Some of the     
 older village has disappeared into the
 sea, as coastal erosion has been      
 significant in the area.              
 The level crossing gates form a       
 barrier between Frinton and the       
 outside world and {'the Gates'}are    
 word-famous. To a certain extent they 
 preserve the 'exclusive' nature of    
 Frinton.Houses inside 'the Gates'     
 fetch a higher price than outside.    </content>
