		<content>  {POSTAL.}The  Post Office  used to be
 on the site of Mrs. Macs shop. In 1940
 the present property was converted to 
 a house and sub post office.          
   The{mail}arrives each day at 6.30am.
 and is sorted by 4 people. It is  then
 delivered  in the village by 3 people,
 who have their  own  area and walk  or
 use  a  moped. A  van  delivers  large
 parcels later. The mail  is  collected
 at  10.30am. and  4.30pm. and taken by
 the{Royal Mail Van}to Lincoln.        
   In 1985  the{houses} in the  village
 were  all re-numbered to make delivery
 easier. Every  house  has  a  postcode
 which  speeds  sorting  at   the  GPO.
 eg.  LN69LV,   LN6 = Lincoln  area  6,
      9 = Swinderby, LV = Station Road.
  {ORAL.}There  is one public telephone
 box in the High Street. All  parts  of
 the UK and most  of  the  World can be
 called by dialing the STD. code.      </content>
