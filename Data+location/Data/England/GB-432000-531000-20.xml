		<title>20SCHOOL CHRISTINGLE SERVICE</title>
		<content> Each year in the last week of the     
 Christmas Term, the children of the   
 school attend St. Michael's Church for
 a Christingle Service.                
 A Christingle is an orange which is   
 decorated in a symbolic way to remind 
 us of Jesus. The orange represents the
 world. Around the orange is a red band
 which symbolises Christ's blood. Four 
 cocktail sticks piercing currants and 
 nuts are stuck into the orange and    
 these represent the four seasons and  
 the fruits of the world. The top of   
 the orange is cored and a candle is   
 pushed into the hole. This represents 
 the 'light' of the world. These       
 Christingles are made in school by    
 eager children. About a week before   
 the service each child is given an    
 envelope in which he is expected to   
 collect money.This is exchanged for a 
 lit Christingle during the service.   </content>
