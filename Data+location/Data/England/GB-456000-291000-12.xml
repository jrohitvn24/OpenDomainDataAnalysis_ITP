 It can be seen from page 11 that the  
 population of Willoughby has increased
 slightly from 1960 to 1970. After that
 it has been steady. So has the number 
 of houses.                            
                                       
                                       
 This was caused by the new streets of 
 detached &amp; semi-detached houses which 
 were built at this time. These were   
 mostly for people who worked in       
 Leicester, or who have just retired,  
 who wanted to live in the country, but
 within easy reach (less than 30       
 minutes' drive) of the centre of      
 Leicester.                            
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
