		<content>   There are several clubs in Adisham. 
The Parish Council runs a weekly       
evening Youth Club.  There is a Cricket
Team and a Gardening Club. The village 
has its own branch of the Women's      
Institute who meet in the hall. Both   
Church and Chapel hold a Women's       
Fellowship, and the Chapel Sunday      
School provides outings for the        
children, and other activities. During 
the winter there is also an indoor     
Badminton Club and Keep Fit classes.   
   Parents organise a playgroup twice a
week for children under school age, and
a baby sitting service exists. Dancing 
classes are held for girls, with a few 
boys. A company of Girl Guides meets   
in the village hall, as does one of    
the Brownies, but they are run by a    
neighbouring parish.  Boys who want to 
belong to Scouts or Cubs have to travel
to outlying villages for meetings.     </content>
