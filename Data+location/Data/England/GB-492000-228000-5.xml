		<title>05WOODLANDS: Deterioration</title>
		<content>{Woodlands}in Bedfordshire have been   
 the centre of some concern in the     
 county.  Despite the small amount in  
 the area some 2 hectares have been    
 lost in the last few years due to     
 clearence for{agricultural}purposes.  
                                       
 80% of the woodland in the county is  
 privately owned and just over 60% is  
 managed for timber production.        
                                       
 Public criticism in{forestry}has      
 involved the{planting}of coniferous   
 species in preference to other types. 
                                       
 Some 25,000 trees in the County have  
 died due to{Dutch Elm disease.}       
                                       
 Loss of{hedgerows}and small spinneys  
 due to intensified and more{mechanised
{farming}is also considered to have    
 contributed landscape deterioration.  </content>
