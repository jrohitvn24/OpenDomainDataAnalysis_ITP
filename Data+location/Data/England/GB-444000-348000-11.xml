		<title>11D.H.Lawrence Centenary.</title>
		<content> The year 1985 marks the centenary of  
 D.H.Lawrences' birth and many tourists
 are visiting Eastwood,the place of his
 birth.The Lawrence family has strong  
 connections with Brinsley.            
 The family moved to Brinsley about    
 1840,all six children of John and     
 Louisa Lawrence being born in the     
 village.The school in the village at  
 this time was St.Johns',situated on   
 Main Street in New Brinsley,close to  
 the present site of St.Johns' Close.  
 Arthur,the eldest son, worked at      
 Brinsley Colliery until 1867 and after
 his marriage to Lydia in 1875 they    
 lived in a small cottage near the     
 railway crossing with his parents.The 
 cottage is still occupied today.Their 
 first child was born here though David
 Herbert was born in Eastwood.He was a 
 frequent visitor to his relatives in  
 Brinsley,especially his grandparents. </content>
