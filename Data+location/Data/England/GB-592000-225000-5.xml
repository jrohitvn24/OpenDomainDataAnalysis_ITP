    WEST BERGHOLT AUTHOR {JOHN GRANT}IS
 A FRIGHTENED MAN.THE BOOKS HE WROTE   
 FOR FUN ARE NOW BEING TURNED INTO A   
 TV SERIES BY THE BBC. AND SUDDENLY    
 IT'S SERIOUS BUSINESS.JOHN WHO HAS A  
 CAREER AS A DOCTOR OF TROPICAL        
 MEDICINES AT THE UNIVERSITY OF        
 LONDON'S FACULTY OF MEDICINE COULD    
 HAVE GIVEN THIS UP BECAUSE OF HIS     
 NEWFOUND POPULARITY AS A WRITER BUT

 THAT DESPITE HIS RECENT SUCCESS HE    
 STILL INSISTS THAT WRITING IS JUST A  
 PASTIME.                              
     THE STORY CHARACTER WHICH IS BEING
 USED IS THAT OF LOVEJOY,WHO SEEMS TO  
 KNOW MORE ABOUT ANTIQUES THAN MOST    
 PEOPLE PUT TOGETHER.  (contd.on page
