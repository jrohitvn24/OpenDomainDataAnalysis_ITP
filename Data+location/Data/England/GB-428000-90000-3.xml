 It was built in 1538 by Henry         
 V111, king of England.The castle      
 is one of a series built around       
 the south coast.There are others      
 at Southsea, Netley, Calshot,         
 Sandown, East and West Cows           
 and Yarmouth.It took many men         
 to build it.You can visit half        
 of it, the other half is being        
 repaired.                             
                                       
 I think it is a good place to         
 visit.There is an exhibition,         
 dungeons and a Tudor tower.           
 Half of it is closed off.             
 Before you go in you have to          
 pay at a place where you can          
 buy things.On the whole it isnt       
 very exiting but its worth the        
 visit.                                </content>
