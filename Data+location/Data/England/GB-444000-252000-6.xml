		<content> At the crossroads between Lower       
 Boddington and Wormleighton stands    
 Spella House, a lovely old house      
 privately owned by a firm of          
 agricultural engineers. It was        
 previously used as kennels but these  
 have now become the office and stores 
 and the house, offices, works and     
 paddock cover four acres. The         
 overgrown pond at the rear of the     
 house has been cleared by the present 
 owners and stocked with carp. The     
 business is based on a radius of      
 thirty miles and moved from the town  
 as a country location is preferable.  
 Agricultural machinery is bought ,    
 sold and repaired here and the        
 appropriate spares and consumables are
 stocked.                              
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
