		<content> The attractive scenery of the valley  
 and the 'olde worlde' nature of the   
 village attracts many visitors every  
 year. Many of the villagers take in   
 visitors for bed and breakfast, and   
 several of the houses are holiday     
 homes. There is a youth hostel a      
 little south of the village. Across   
 the valley is Limefitt caravan and    
 camping site. A popular site with many
 facilities, it has nevertheless       
 aroused much controversy over the     
 years, especially during its expanding
 phase early in the 7O's. Attempts to  
 increase the capacity of the site were
 fought by the people of the valley,   
 via public enquiries, but they were   
 not successful. There is no doubt     
 that, initially, the bigger site was a
 major eyesore in the open valley floor
 but screening has taken effect and    
 opposition has died down.             </content>
