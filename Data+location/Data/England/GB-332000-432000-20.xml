		<title>20LITTER BINS START HERE.</title>
		<content> The plastic litter bin that you see in
 most of our towns and cities today    
 could very well have been produced by 
 Glasdon's at their large factory on   
 Preston New Road in Marton.           
 If you pass the site you will see     
 hundreds of yellow bins neatly stored 
 along with grit-boxes,fibre_glass     
 kiosks and many other items which will
 eventually decorate our streets,parks 
 and other public places.              
 The company sells its products        
 throughout the country and to many    
 places overseas and this is clearly   
 illustrated by the flags of the       
 various countries that fly outside the
 factory whenever people from those    
 countries are visiting the factory.   
 The phrase 'Made in Blackpool' isn't  
 only restricted to rock and funny     
 hats!
