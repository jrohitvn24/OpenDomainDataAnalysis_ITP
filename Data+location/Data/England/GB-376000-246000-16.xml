		<title>16HALFKEY FARM</title>
		<content> Mr. Pudges farm covers 121 acres. It's
 split into two parts, one eight miles 
 away in Much Cowarne. The main part is
 situated just out of Malvern. He keeps
 sixty ewes, beef cattle, pigs and     
 geese. Any pests such as foxes and    
 crows he shoots with the help of his  
 gun-dog, Chips. His other dog is a    
 sheep dog. Mr. Pudge produces enough  
 milk and eggs for his own use. Half   
 his farm is grass and half arable. On 
 his arable land he grows wheat, winter
 barley, winter oats and cider fruit.  
 He finds the busiest time of the year 
 Autumn when he has to do many things  
 like silage making and hay making.    
 Most of the animals are sent to       
 Ledbury, Worcester and Hereford       
 markets, but some are sold privately. 
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
