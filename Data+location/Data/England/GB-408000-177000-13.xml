		<title>13BINCKNOLL  CASTLE.</title>
		<content>{Bincknoll Castle}used to be an Iron   
 Age stronghold. It would have had a   
 wooden fence on top of the mounds.    
 Huts might have been made from stone  
 and straw. Now it has a lot of grass  
 banks and there are only very little  
 mounds because people have walked over
 it alot.If you stand on top of the    
 hill you can see{Swindon}in the north 
 east. On the{Ridgeway}above Bincknoll 
 in the south east you can see the     
 large hill fort called{BARBURY CASTLE 
 You can find{BINCKNOLL CASTLE}by going
 along foot paths or bridleways from   
 Broad Hinton, Broad Town,             
 Wroughton,Salthrop, or Bincknoll farm 
 just outside Wootton Bassett.
