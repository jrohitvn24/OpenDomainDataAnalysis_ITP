		<title>02Bridport's Shopping Centre</title>
		<content>      The shopping centre is larger    
 than would be expected for a town the 
 size of Bridport as it also serves    
 many of the surrounding villages, as  
 well as the influx of visitors during 
 the summer period.                    
      The three main shopping streets, 
 East Street, West Street and South    
 Street, meet at the Town Hall forming 
 a T-shape. The busiest days are       
 Friday and the two market days,       
 Wednesday and Saturday. Thursday is   
 early closing day.                    
      There is a wide variety of shops 
 including supermarkets, greengrocers, 
 bakers, clothes, shoe, D-I-Y, gift,   
 newsagents, book and electrical shops.
 There are also a number of estate     
 agents, banks and solicitors offices. 
 The numerous cafes and pubs offer     
 shoppers a wide choice of refreshment.
