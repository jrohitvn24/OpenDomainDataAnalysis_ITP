		<content> Most people have O and A Levels except
 the elderly. The highest number found 
 being 10 O Levels and 7 A Levels. Most
 people gained their qualifications    
 from universities and colleges, but   
 some people gained them in night      
 schools  and basic  education. The    
 average age of school leavers is 16.5.
 This average was taken from two       
 generations of people. The younger    
 generation  has more access to further
 education. A large majority thought   
 the local  Grammar Schools should not 
 be abolished but others thought that  
 everyone should have equal education. 
 The  majority thought that schools    
 should have corporal punishment and   
 homework should be set. 50% of people 
 think that local schools do a good    
 job.
