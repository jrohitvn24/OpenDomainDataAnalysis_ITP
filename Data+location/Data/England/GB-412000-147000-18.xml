		<title>18LEISURE ACTIVITIES</title>
		<content>  A questionaire was prepared and sent 
 to{fifty homes in the area}asking for 
 information about{leisure time        
{activities.}The most popular one was  
{swimming and seven out of the nine had
{lessons with a special club. Football 
 was also very popular and those taking
 part trained with a club. Other       
 activities included{horse riding,     
{golf, majorettes, bird-watching,      
{roller-skating,tennis, squash and     
{several individual collections,e.g.   
{rubbers, paper weights. Several       
{families have avaries.                
  The cost of the activities depended  
 on whether the people belonged to a   
 club, took special lessons and/or     
 needed special equipment. Club members
 met regularly (usually once a week)   
 but others followed their interests   
 when they felt inclined.
