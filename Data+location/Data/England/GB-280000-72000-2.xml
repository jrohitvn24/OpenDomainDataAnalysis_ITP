		<content>{Coldeast village}is about 175 years   
 old with approximately 200 houses and 
 a predominantly old population.A post 
 office/store,public house(The Star),  
 owned by Pete Budd a singer from The  
 Wurzels folk group,and a United       
 Reformed Church serve the village.This
 former chapel holds 100 people but    
 wedding and funeral services do not   
 take place.The various leisure        
 activites take place at Liverton      
 Village Hall and include bingo, whist 
 drives, brownies, guides, folk dancing
 W.I. over 60's  and Sunday School     
 meetings. Housing is supplememted by  
 2 residential caravan sites (70) and  
 one campsite. Plans are afoot to      
 double the village size. In 1977 the  
 main A38 dual carriageway opened and  
{Coldeast}breathed a sigh of relief.   
 Residents now fear traffic may rise as
 Trago Mills seek access via {Coldeast.</content>
