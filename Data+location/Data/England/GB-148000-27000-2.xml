		<title>02ST.MICHAEL'S MOUNT HISTORY-1</title>
		<content> For approximately 300 years before    
 the birth of Christ, the Mount was    
 a{port and trading market}dealing in  
 Cornish tin.                          
 The original{Domesday Book}says that  
 the Mount was dedicated to St. Michael
 and belonged to a priest named Brismar
 at the time of King Edward the        
 Confessor.                            
 In 1135 the abbot of Mont.St.Michel in
 Normandy built a{priory}on St.        
 Michael's Mount. There were strong    
 links between the two religious       
 communities for many years. St.       
 Michael's Mount was a famous place    
 of pilgrimage throughout the Middle   
 Ages. After the dissolution of the    
 monasteries the Mount became a        
{garrison.}It was one of the beacons   
 which signalled the approach of the   
 Spanish Armada in 1587.
