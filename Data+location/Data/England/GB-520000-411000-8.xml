		<content> There is great diversity in family    
 groups ranging from young married     
 couples, couples with children (on    
 average 2) and elderly couples. A wide
 range of household appliances is      
 available to housewives. This means   
 many have a part time job as well as  
 looking after the home and family.    
 There are a great many convenience    
 foods available, many bought in bulk  
 and stored in a home freezer. With the
 recent development of the Microwave   
 Cooker, food can be cooked in a matter
 of minutes. Household services ie.    
 gas, electricity and water have built 
 in safety devices to reduce the risk  
 of accidents. A number of households  
 have a range of domestic pets most    
 popular being cats and dogs.
