		<title>17PUBLIC HOUSES IN SADDLEWORTH</title>
		<content> The Cross Keys Inn, originally called 
 the 'Gravemakers' is near Saddleworth 
 Church &amp; accessible by a field path,  
 said to be the former packhorse road. 
 It was built in 1745 by the Bottomley 
 family, &amp; owned by the Buckley's for  
 over 100 years. An upper room was used
 for Hunt Suppers in the 1920's &amp; 30's,
 &amp; black pudding was traditionally     
 served. Hare-hunting was the main     
 sport of the area &amp; Saddleworth had   
 its own pack of hounds, which had no  
 permanent quarters but were farmed out
 to any members of the hunt. The tap   
 room at the Inn still has white-topped
 tables, flagged floor &amp; old-fashioned 
 fireplace. It is the present base for 
 the Oldham Mountain Rescue team, the  
 Saddleworth Outdoor Pursuits Assoc. &amp; 
 Saddleworth Morris Men. The Church Inn
 (formerly New Inn) is nearby &amp; has an 
 old fireplace &amp; handbells of interest.</content>
