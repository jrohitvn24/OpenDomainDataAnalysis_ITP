		<content>{William Barnes}was a local poet,      
 famous for his poems written in       
 traditional Dorset dialect. Barnes was
 the rector of Came Church near Came   
 House. He is buried in the little     
 churchyard of Came Church. In the     
 church visitors book, there are       
 records of people who still come here 
 from all parts of Britain especially  
 to see where Barnes is buried, and to 
 see where he worked.                  
                                       
{Thomas Hardy}is famous for his poems  
 and stories. He built a house called  
 Max Gate just East of Dorchester.     
 Tourists from as far away as the U.S.A
 and Japan come on 'pilgrimages' to    
 Dorchester to see where he lived and  
 worked.In his novels Dorchester is    
 referred to as Casterbridge and the   
 public house 'The Trumpet Major' is   
 named after one of his books.         </content>
