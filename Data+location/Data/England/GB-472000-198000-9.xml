The church of St Peter and St Paul is  
made of building stone and dates,in    
its earliest parts from the 11th       
century.   The first recorded vicar    
was Philip de Pontefracto -1307 to     
1334.The church has a panel of         
mediaeval stained glass in the north   
wall of the Nave,showing an angel      
playing a harp,and some smaller pieces 
in the east window of the north aisle. 
There are six bells in the tower,the   
earliest of which was cast about 1450  
and three others which were cast about 
1625.
