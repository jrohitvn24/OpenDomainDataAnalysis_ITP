		<title>15Smarden W. - Unigate Dairies</title>
		<content> Unigate Dairies is the major employer 
 in the Headcorn/Smarden area. Over 160
 people work there, either in the      
 retail division, the processing plant 
 or in the garage. The bulk milk       
 tankers collect raw milk from farms in
 central Kent and E Sussex. Returning  
 to Unigate the milk is processed and  
 packed into bottles, cartons, catering
 packs and polybottles. The milk is    
 then distributed by lorry to most of  
 Kent and E Sussex. The delivery       
 roundsmen are also based at Unigate   
 Dairies. Their electric milk floats   
 are a familiar sight in the           
 countryside. Not only do they deliver 
 milk to their 6200 customers but also 
 a food product range which includes   
 bread, potatoes and soft drinks. The  
 garage at Unigate maintains the       
 lorries and milk floats from the      
 entire area.                          </content>
