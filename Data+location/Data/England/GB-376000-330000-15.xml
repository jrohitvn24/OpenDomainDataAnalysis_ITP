The local school in Croxton was closed 
when the Local Education Authority     
decided to transport the children to   
schools in Eccleshall and Stafford.    
The children attend First and Middle   
Schools in Eccleshall and go into      
Stafford for their Upper School        
Education.                             
The closure of the village school in   
Croxton destroyed the focal point of   
this small community.  Which has yet to
replaced.                              
There is great objection to the        
Authority's latest plan which suggests 
transporting the children to Stafford  
from the age of nine with the closure  
of one of the Eccleshall schools.      
Parents feel that the children will los
the social benefits of education within
the community.
