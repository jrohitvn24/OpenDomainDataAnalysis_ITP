 survey.Most people had an occupation  
 and it was full-time.A lot of people  
 were employed by others,but there were
 two who were self employed.The self   
 employed people employed 2to3 people  
 at a time.Most of the people worked at
 a public service but four were        
 commercial and two involved in        
 transport.People's positions were     
 mostly skilled and managerial and 3   
 were semi skilled.Most people         
 travelled to work by car.The range of 
 miles travelled was from 1M,to 360    
 miles.
