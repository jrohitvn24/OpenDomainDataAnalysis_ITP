		<title>12Ogbourne cafe and garage</title>
		<content> The cafe is joined to the garage and  
 lots of truck drivers stop there for a
 break.The garage is little and doesn't
 use its pumps now.It's by the main    
 road.The garage has got some toilets  
 in a hut.My next door neighbour works 
 in the garage, so does my friend.     
 They've got a shed where cars are     
 repaired.                             
 The cafe has got 4 games machines and 
 a carpark behind the cafe.            
 The cafe is a nice place and they     
 serve hot and cold food.The people who
 work in the garage have their food    
 there.The cafe is closed all Sunday   
 and it opens weekdays from 7.30 am to 
 5.30pm, its busiest times are 8.30 to 
 10.30 am.On busy days they have about 
 150 to 200 customers.
