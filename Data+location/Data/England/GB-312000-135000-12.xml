		<content>   {Major Thomas Trollope -Bellew }    
 has recently retired as a County      
 Councillor- a position which has      
 consumed much of his time over recent 
 years through offices in Taunton      
 (County Hall) and Dulverton (Exmoor   
 House).                               
  Crowcombe Court, Beadons and The     
 Cottage have all been home for The    
 Major who now lives in a recently     
 constructed property 'The Bungalow'.  
{ The family estate extends to some    
{1600 acres,}though some is in         
 Lincolnshire and includes farming,    
 woodland and hills.                   
  The family name Carew has its roots  
 in Pembrokeshire where there is a     
{Carew Castle.}The name has no recent  
 connection with the Carew name linked 
 with the raised ship The Mary Rose.   
  The Major now spends time farming,   
 growing roses and watching cricket.   </content>
