		<title>16Chapel School sports day</title>
		<content> Chapel Primary School has a sports    
 day.Parents and friends come to see   
 the children running.There are teams  
 which are the colours of Red,Green and
 Yellow.Yellow have won for the last   
 two years.Our coach as such is Miss   
 Fields,who teaches the six and seven  
 year old children.Her class is class  
 two.On the day every child makes a    
 rosette which he or she wears on the  
 afternoon.They make them out of       
 coloured paper.The colours are either 
 Red, Green or Yellow.It turns out to  
 be a great day and everybody enjoys   
 the day out to see the children       
 racing.
