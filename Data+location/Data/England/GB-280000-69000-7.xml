		<title>07DENBURY SCHOOL MAY DAY</title>
		<content> On Saturday we went to the school     
 where there was a May Fair.There      
 were lots of things going on,like     
 netball and funny football, maypole   
 dancing, country dancing and other    
 games. You could pay about 5p a go and
 see if you could win back more money  
 than when you paid.We played netball  
 against the mums and they won.        
 The football was played by the boys   
 against the dads and the boys won.    
 There were things to eat like cakes   
 and hotdogs,sandwiches etc.There were 
 also some contests.One of them was to 
 guess how many ballons there were in  
 the car.When they found out who the   
 winner was they let all the ballons   
 go!
