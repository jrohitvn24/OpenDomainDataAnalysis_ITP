 already tumbling down old places and  
 where Grosvenor House offices are now 
 that used to be the Grosvenor Hotel, a
 huge big great hotel and when I was a 
 little girl there were 22 pubs in     
 Wivenhoe.We all had Gas in those days 
 not electricity because it cost a lot 
 of money in those days and we could

{Mrs Allen:}Valley road estate and Dene
 Park were sand pits when I was a      
 child.When it snowed Bobbits Way was  
 thick with snow and I used to sledge  
 down there.
