		<title>06Health-Gleadless Valley</title>
		<content> At Gleadless Valley school we have a  
 health education programme for our    
 students.This includes advice on      
 preventative dental care-the Natural  
 Nashers Project, and a Food and Health
 Project which is based on the findings
 of the NACNE Report published in      
 1983.We are also very concerned about 
 food labelling and the contents of    
 processed foods.We have investigated  
 the labels and contents of many brands
 of commercial yoghurt and compared    
 them with our own home-made variety.We
 have found that many contain a lot of 
 refined sugar and other additives     
 which are put in for the sake of      
 appearance rather than nutrition.We   
 also found,not suprisingly, that most 
 students preferred sweetened yoghurt  
 with added colouring rather than      
 home-made yoghurt flavoured with fresh
 fruit though some said they liked it. </content>
