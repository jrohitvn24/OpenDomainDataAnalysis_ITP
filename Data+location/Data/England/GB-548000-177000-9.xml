		<content>  The morning service begins with the  
 Giranthi (reader) placing a piece of  
 cloth on his head. He then goes into a
 room and places the Guru Granthi Sahib
 (the holy book) on the cloth. He walks
 over to a special area where he places
 the holy book and unwraps the cloth   
 from it. He opens the book to the     
 middle page and reads a paragraph and 
 then turns to the first page. He reads
 five pages which shows the proper     
 morning service.                      
  At the end of the service the servant
 brings the Karah Parshad (the sacred  
 food) into the temple for all the     
 people to eat.                        
  Once the service has finished people 
 bow their heads and walk outside.
