		<title>14A DAY IN MY LIFE AT HOME</title>
		<content> I wake up about 6.00 _ 6.30 every     
 morning. I go into the Bathroom then  
 back to bed,  to read my books. I get 
 up about 9.30 on holidays or weekends.
 I get washed then dressed. I usually  
 wear trousers. I have  my breakfast   
 which is toast and cereal. After my   
 breakfast I either read or watch      
 television. When I am by myself I have
 lunch about 1.00 and cook myself      
 poached egg or spaghetti rings on     
 toast. My hobbies are collecting      
 stamps and rubbers. On Thursdays I go 
 to Horse Rangers by Hampton Court. We 
 have two cats which are Blue Point    
 (Siamese),three goldfish, eight       
 bantams of which five are hens.       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
