 THE NORTH OF SOUTHAMPTON CITY WITHIN  
 THE RURUAL_URBAN FRINGE.IT HAS        
 RETAINED ITS RURAL CHARACTER WITH A   
 NURSERY SCHOOL AND A FEW SMALL        
 HOUSING PROJECTS BEING THE ONLY MODERN
 DEVELOPMENTS. THE VILLAGE CHURCH      
 REMAINS A FOCAL POINT,WITH THE        
 ORIGINAL HOUSES LOCATED IN CLOSE      
 PROXIMITY TO THE CHURCH ALONG A NARROW
 ROUTE_WAY. SOME OF THESE ARE THATCHED,
 OTHERS HAVE SLATE ROOFS AND THEY ARE  
 ALL OF OLD CONSTRUCTION. HOWEVER,     
 WITHIN THIS AFFLUENT AREA THERE ARE   
 SIGNS OF NEGLECT,PERHAPS ILLUSTRATING 
 THE PRESENCE OF AN AGEING POORER      
 COMMUNITY, THE ORIGINAL POPULATION,   
 WHO ARE NOW BEING REPLACED BY THE     
 WEALTHIER CITY COMMUTERS;A            
 CHARACTERISTIC TREND OF THE RURAL_    
 URBAN FRINGE.
