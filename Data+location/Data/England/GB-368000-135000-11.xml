		<title>11    Bruton Playschool.</title>
		<content>  The playschool is an established part
 of life in our area and many children 
 aged between three and four years     
 benefit from it's activities, about   
 twenty children go each morning.The   
 organisers feel it's important for    
 young children to get to know each    
 other and to learn to share things.   
       The children take part in       
 activities like painting, puzzles,    
 sticking, singing, listening to       
 stories and playing in the Wendy      
 House.                                
      At the moment playschool costs Â£1
 a session.                            
      The leader enjoys working with   
 the children,finding them particularly
 interesting at that age.
