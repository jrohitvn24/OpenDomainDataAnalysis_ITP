		<title>14Rochford Church</title>
		<content> There are many places of worship in   
 the Rochford area of all types and    
 denominations; Baptist, Methodist,    
 Spiritualist, Roman Catholic, Church  
 of England, Evangelical etc. The      
 largest of these is the C of E Church 
 in Rochford, the Parish Church of St. 
 Andrew. It was mainly built in the    
 15th century. Its most outstanding    
 feature in its red brick tower, built 
 by Thomas Boteler, Earl of Ormond. The
 Tower of Rochford church in the past  
 has secreted illicit spirits, tea and 
 cloth brought from France via the     
 River Roche. In a cavity below the    
 pulpit, it is said, the smugglers'    
 ammunition was stored! The East window
 is of early perpendicular work of five
 lights, the head filled with mullioned
 tracery. The church has a full peal of
 bells. The names on the graves in the 
 yard are yet known in Rochford today. </content>
