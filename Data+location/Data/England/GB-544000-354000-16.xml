		<content> The changes in farm work are almost   
 beyond belief since I began my working
 life 70 years ago. Nearly all farm    
 workers lived in tied cottage and they
 walked to work or cycled if they were 
 lucky. I was a wagonner and started   
 work at 4.30 to have the horses ready 
 by 6.30 and finished at 4 p.m. in the 
 winter or 8 p.m. or later in the      
 summer. Nearly all the work was of a  
 manual nature. Potatoes were planted  
 and picked by hand and put into 8     
 stone sacks and taken to Eastville    
 station by horse or lorry. Cereals    
 were drilled using horses, harvested  
 using binders, dryed in stooks,       
 stacked in the farmyard and later     
 threshed and put into 12 to 18 stone  
 bags which were carried manually.     
 Weeds and pests were controlled by    
 hand hoeing.There were many more small
 farms instead of todays large farms.  </content>
