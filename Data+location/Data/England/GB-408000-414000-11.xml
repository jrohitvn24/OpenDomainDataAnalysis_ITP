		<title>11Huddersfield Narrow Canal</title>
		<content>    In the canal there are stones and  
 rubbish.It is very shallow and full of
 reeds and boats cannot get through.   
 However, restoration work is being    
 carried out by the Huddersfield Canal 
 Society which will enable boats to use
 the canal again.An old swing bridge   
 crosses the canal. It has two metal   
 plates where the wood has rotted and  
 the winding gear which opened the     
 bridge has gone rusty. There is an    
 aquaduct over the River Colne where   
 the canal narrows.                    
    Further down stream is a lock which
 has been filled in and grassed over to
 stop people falling in.There is still 
 a way for the water to get through.   
    At the lower end of Milnsbridge    
 there is a wharf.You can still see a  
 couple of iron rings where the boats  
 were moored. There are two road       
 bridges over the canal in Milnsbridge.</content>
