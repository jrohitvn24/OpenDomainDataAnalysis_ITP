		<title>12New Forest-Felling Deciduous</title>
		<content> The yield of{Deciduous or hardwood    
 trees from the whole New Forest is    
 approximately 5000 tons per annum. The
 New Forest hardwood is of low quality 
 due to the poor soil of the area.     
 Therefore in spite of the longer      
 growing time than softwoods or        
 conifers, it fetches only about       
 Â£36/cubic metre (compared to Â£47 for  
 Douglas Fir, and Â£37 for Corsican     
 Pine) however hardwoods are planted to
 provide variety and a pleasing        
 environment for an area which is also 
 used for leisure by many people.      
 Hardwood is used in these ways:       
 1. 10% is of furniture quality and is 
    cut into short planking.           
 2. 40-50% is used for fencing         
    material.                          
 3. 40-50% goes to mines.
