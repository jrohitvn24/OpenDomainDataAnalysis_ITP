		<title>04  Crops on Furzen Farm</title>
		<content> Furzen Farm is part of the Addington  
Estate.There are 1032 acres split up as
follows: 350 acres of grass;400 acres  
of winter wheat;100 acres ofwinter     
barley;100 acres of winter oats;50     
acres of beans and 32 acres of roads,  
woodland and farmbuildings.            
 The farmer told us a saying which     
helps us recognise the different crops.
Wheat has whiskers,barley has a beard, 
oats are out (because they are easy to 
recognise).                            
 The grass is cut in Summer to make    
both silage and hay.Silege is stored   
under plastic sheeting with tyres on   
top to hold it down and keep the air   
out.Hay is carefully dried,baled and   
stacked in a barn.Hay is fed to the    
animals in Winter.                     
 Barley and oats are sold as cash      
crops.Straw from the corn is kept as   
bedding for the stock in Winter.       </content>
