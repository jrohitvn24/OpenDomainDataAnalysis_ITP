		<title>03BODRAVERRAN FARM</title>
		<content> We went to Bodraverran Farm where they
 have 10 acres of land.It is a small   
 mixed farm.They have two big green-   
 houses in which they grow courgettes, 
 peppers,avocados,cucumbers,grapevines,
 carrots,lettuce,cabbages,tomatoes,    
 spring-onions and shallots.They take  
 them to a green-grocers shop in Pen-  
 zance.                                
 They have lots of chickens and a big  
 American Red Cock,they also have      
 bantams and lacewings.They have many  
 ducks,some of which are Muscovy and   
 others are white ducks with yellow    
 beaks.There are also geese and        
 goslings.                             
 They have a sort of hospital for de-  
 formed and injured animals.One of the 
 ducks there is blind,another is lame. 
 Inside the house there is a duckling  
 in an incubator because its mother    
 would not look after it.              </content>
