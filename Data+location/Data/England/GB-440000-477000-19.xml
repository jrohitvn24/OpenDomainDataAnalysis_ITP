		<title>19Local History-rural Sowerby</title>
		<content>    Local history is singularly lacking
 in this area of scattered farms which 
 has no other buildings or ancient     
 earthworks.                           
    Four of the farms along with their 
 cottages form the hamlet of           
 Thorpefield. One of these farms       
 Thorpefield House is now known as     
 Millburn Farm, after a farmer living  
 there became famous for his books     
 about farming. These are still in use 
 today.                                
    An ancient Inn called the          
 "Travellers Rest" on the Thirsk to    
 Topcliffe Road has now been replaced  
 by a Filling Station. The Old Limetree
 House is now Topcliffe Parks.         
    Many old paths and green lanes are 
 gone,as is Topcliffe Common, where the
 potters, tinkers and gypsies used to  
 gather for Topcliffe Fair in its      
 heyday.                               </content>
