 split between the three parishes of   
 Great Leighs , Great Waltham , and    
 Terling.                              
   It has woodland covering about 5% of
 the area and 85% is arable            
 cultivation, the majority of the      
 crops being Wheat and Barley with     
 some oil seed Rape.There are one or   
 two fields left as meadow land.       
   There are 21 farm houses within this
 area , but most of them are now used  
 as private houses.The land is owned by
 other people and companies, one of    
 whom is Lord Rayleighs Farms,         
 Lord Rayleigh himself living in       
 Terling Place in the village.         
   There is a small industrial area    
 where a firm manufactures paper and   
 plastic bags.
