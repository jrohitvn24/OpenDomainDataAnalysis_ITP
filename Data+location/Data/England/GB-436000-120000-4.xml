		<title>04Emma King Concert Day</title>
		<content> On June 6 1985. It was a Thursday     
 the second day of the concert.7.30am I
 was up and a wake and excited.At about
 8.15am we set off to go to school.    
 9.00am we went into the hall to have  
 hymn practice. 10.30am it was play    
 time and I was wondering what was     
 going to happen at the concert that   
 night.12.00am I went to Swimming Club 
 and practised some strokes.12.30am    
 changed and had lunch.2.45pm We had   
 rounders and we won.3.40pm School had 
 finished and we went to collect Jason 
 from school.6.45 got to school ready  
 for the concert.7.00 The concert      
 started and the orchestra played See  
 the Conquering Hero come. Half way    
 through the concert we had a break.   
 The audience went to have a drink  and
 a biscuit and so did the orchestra and
 choir. I enjoyed myself that day while
 we were playing.                      </content>
