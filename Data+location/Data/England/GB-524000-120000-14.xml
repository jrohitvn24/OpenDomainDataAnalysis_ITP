		<title>14A Sunny Morning in Bolney.</title>
		<content> The sun shines through my yellow      
 curtains and turns the room all gold.I
 have breakfast and go to let out the  
 geese who make an awful racket. The   
 air is fresh and the cobwebs look like
 silver threads. The moon is still out,
 a big silver ball in a light blue sky.
 Rabbits scurry away, clouds look like 
 chunks of cotton wool and trees sway  
 gently. Along the lane the cows look  
 at us with huge brown eyes across     
 flowery hedges and honeysuckle and    
 wild roses smell lovely. But when we  
 get to the A272 it is all noise, with 
 cars whizzing up and down. In the     
 village street it is all quiet again, 
 except for the children coming to     
 school, laughing and chattering and   
 birds singing.  The church bell chimes
 quarter to nine and we play in the sun
 until it is time to go in to school.
