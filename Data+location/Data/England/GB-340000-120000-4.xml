		<content> Today we went to see how the withies  
 are boiled and stripped ready to be   
 made into the finished product.Most   
 withies are cut in November.They are  
 taken to a shed,stacked in bundles and
 left to dry.When they are completely  
 dry they are boiled in lots of 150    
 bundles for eight hours in a          
 rectangular tank,and then they are    
 stripped.Boiling them makes them go a 
 golden brown.Some of the withies are  
 cut in February.These are planted     
 upright in 15 centimetres of water    
 with mud at the bottom so that they   
 can root and continue growing.These   
 are stripped,about June,to provide    
 white withies.Before you can make a   
 basket with any withies you must let  
 them soak in water for two hours,to   
 make them pliable.
