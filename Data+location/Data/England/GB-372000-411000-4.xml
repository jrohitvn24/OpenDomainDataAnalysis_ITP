		<content> In recent times old people's homes and
 sheltered accommodation have been     
 built near Hall-ith-Wood and at Eagley
 Court on Darwen Road.The latter has 37
 residents,average age 80-90,living in 
 flats.There are more women than men.  
 Affetside is a small isolated         
 village.It has cottages that are      
 150-200 years old and that were built 
 for coal miners or as shops and public
 houses.Most of the homes had outside  
 toilets and no water so they had to   
 collect it from a well.Some however,  
 had underground water-pumps.
