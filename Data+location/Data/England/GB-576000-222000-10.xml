		<title>10COURTAULD AND CRITTALL</title>
		<content> Industrial life in Braintree has been 
 developed largely through the medium  
 of two firms.Courtauld for the silk   
 industry and crittall for the metal   
 industry. George courtauld erected a  
 mill in Braintree in 1809 and the     
 business prospered to be a world wide 
 name.Now nolonger in Braintree the    
 Courtauld name is assouated with the  
 town through the many public          
 benefactions made by members of the   
 family.Crittals has its origins in a  
 shop in bank street from 1849. The    
 firm has two interest ironmiongery and
 metal working.Parts of the metal      
 window factory can be found in        
 premises built in 1893 in Manor       
 street.
