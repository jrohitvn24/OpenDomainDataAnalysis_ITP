 SCHOOL UNIFORM, PRIVATE SCHOOLS ARE   
 PARTICULARLY STRICT ABOUT             
 THIS. PRIVATE OR FEE PAYING SCHOOLS   
 ARE ACTUALLY REFERRED TO AS PUBLIC    
 SCHOOLS! THE MOST FAMOUS ONE OF THESE 
 IS HARROW SCHOOL WHICH DOMINATES      
 HARROW HILL. IT WAS FOUNDED IN 1572 BY
 JOHN LYON AND WAS GRANTED A ROYAL     
 CHARTER BY ELIZABETH THE FIRST. THE   
 SCHOOL AND ITS GROUNDS COVER OVER 300 
 ACRES WITH CRICKET PITCHES ON THE WEST
 SIDE OF THE HILL AND A SPORTS CENTRE  
 AND SCHOOL FARM ON THE EAST. THE      
 SCHOOL IS COMPRISED OF ELEVEN BOARDING
 HOUSES AND THERE ARE 77 ACADEMIC STAFF
 AND 754 BOYS. THE FEES ARE AMONG THE  
 MOST EXPENSIVE IN THE COUNTRY-        
 CURRENTLY OVER Â£5850 PER YEAR. ONE OF 
 THE SCHOOL'S FAMOUS OLD BOYS IS SIR   
 WINSTON CHURCHILL AFTER WHOM ONE OF   
 THE HALLS IS NAMED.                   </content>
