 Every week 400 to 500 people spend    
 Â£1.50 to attend the turkish baths     
 to relax and bathe.Friday is the      
 busiest day.Men and women use the     
 baths on alternate days.In the summer 
 more women attend than men- perhaps to
 prepare for holidays.A person gets hot
 steam for about 15 minutes then a cold
 dip for about 15 minutes then they    
 pick a room with the temperature they 
 prefer.The turkish baths has been open
 21 years .The Langbaurgh council owns 
 the turkish baths.The temperatures    
 in the turkish baths are medium hot   
 and very hot.Mr.Pipe has worked in    
 the massage room for 15 years and he  
 said he likes his job.It is one pound 
 fifty pence to get in.
