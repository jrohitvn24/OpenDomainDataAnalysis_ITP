		<content> Shirwell is an area of farming.  Dairy
 farming is most common. Other         
 farming carried out in the area is    
 sheep and beef farming but this is not
 as popular as dairy.  Dairy farming is
 carried out at New Barn Farm, East    
 Plaistow, Sloely Barton, Sepscott and 
 Brightlycott. East Plaistow is a      
 dairy &amp; beef farm.It was  built around
 300 years ago and has an area of 260  
 acres.Tractors trailers and an        
 automatic milking machine are used    
 instead of the old fashioned way. The 
 house is made from cob (compostion of 
 clay gravel and straw). The house was 
 a lot bigger before a bedroom was     
 knocked down and a slab patio outside 
 the kitchen was put up in place of an 
 old scullery. Also outside, a sheep   
 pen was made into a bungalow.
