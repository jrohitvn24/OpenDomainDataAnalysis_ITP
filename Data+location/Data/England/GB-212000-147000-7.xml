		<content> Grey seals are a small part of Lundy's
 animal population but I find them very
 interesting creatures and I'm sure    
 you will agree.Here is some           
 information on them.                  
                                       
{GREY SEALS}Over 75% of the world's    
 Grey seals (about 80,000 in 1984) are 
 found in British coastal waters. The  
 majority are found around Scotland    
 because they prefer places that are   
 inaccessible to man.But since Lundy   
 is only inhabited by 17 people, and it
 has coves unreachable by either land  
 or sea, Grey seals have lived there   
 happily for hundreds of years.        
                                       
{PUPS}It is estimated that up to 50% of
 Grey seal pups do not survive their   
 first year.They are battered against  
 rocks and swept off beaches by the    
 rough seas. (continued)               </content>
