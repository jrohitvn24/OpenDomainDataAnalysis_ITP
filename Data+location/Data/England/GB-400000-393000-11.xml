		<content> In this 'D-block' 4.5sq.km. is        
 agricultural land, the rest is mainly 
 covered with housing, factories and   
 houses being built close to each      
 other. The older houses are built of{ 
{local gritstone},{brick}being used for
 a small number of houses built before 
 1930 and for almost all those built   
 after 1945. The farm houses and       
 terraced houses are the oldest types  
 in the area, semi-detached and detach-
 ed coming later. The newer houses,    
 private and council, have been built  
 in estates and in recent years mainly 
 the former have been built. The newest
 developments have been in Hadfield,   
 Charlesworth,&amp; Simmondley (1980-85)   
 There are few bungalows, for not many 
 old people move into the area to live.
 The farm buildings show the importance
 of this work in the past. Today many  
 travel to work in Manchester by rail. </content>
