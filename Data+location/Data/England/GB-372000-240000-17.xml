		<title>17A day at The Elms School</title>
		<content>  At 7.30 on a summer's morning we     
 awake, summoned by the bell.          
 Compulsory exercise, that makes us    
 feel even more tired, is followed by  
 breakfast and then the quiet of       
 Chapel.  Seven periods of teaching    
 spread over a typical day, which we   
 like or dislike in varying degrees,   
 are separated by the pleasures of     
 eating, the joy or misery of games,   
 and free time which is popular with   
 all. It sounds commonplace and        
 uninteresting, but there are moments  
 that stick in the memory; of          
 achievement, of failure even, of      
 friendships made. The day passes. The 
 seniors hear the 9 o'clock news and   
 then all is, or should be, quiet. Are 
 we happy? Most of us feel reasonably  
 so; but as the day of leaving         
 approaches, hardly any say good-bye   
 with more than a twinge of regret.    </content>
