		<title>10 AGRICULTURE OF THE LAND</title>
		<content> Most farming is found in the south    
west  of the area, between Exning and  
Burwell. This is because the land near 
Newmarket  and Exning is used as studs.
We visited two farms, Springhead Farm  
and Gravelpit Farm.The larger of the   
two farms,Gravelpit Farm produced the  
most crops and is situated in vast     
amounts of cultivated and woodland     
areas.Springhead Farm is also situated 
in cultivated areas.Both farms produce 
the same sort of crops like,winter     
wheat,winter barley,spring barley,     
winter beans and sugarbeet.The two     
farms produce about the same amount of 
crops an acre,but as Gravelpit is a lot
bigger they make a lot more money.     
Springhead Farm has around 60 acres of 
land which is cultivated,while         
Gravelpit has over 150 acres of        
cultivated and woodland ground.
