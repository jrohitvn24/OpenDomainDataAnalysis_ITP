		<title>02LIFE IN 1985</title>
		<content>  Life today is comparatively easy in  
 this area.It is a fairly wealthy one  
 though,being commuter territory,the   
 prices are high too.                  
  Most families have at least one car  
 and some have even two or three.Most  
 homes have at least one colour        
 television set,stereo and hi_fi       
 equipment and a computer.             
  Housewives have many labour saving   
 devices to help them with the chores. 
 There are electric and computer       
 controlled washing machines,tumble    
 dryers,dishwashers,food processors,   
 coffee making machines,cleaners,      
 polishers.Unfortunately the dusting   
 still has to be done by hand.         
  Husbands have many devices to help   
 them decorate and garden more easily. 
  Family life is very pleasant though  
 it can be isolated.Houses stand in    
 their own grounds.Estates are few.    </content>
