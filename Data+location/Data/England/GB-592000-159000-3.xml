		<title>03A TYPICAL SCHOOL DAY</title>
		<content> I arrive at school at about 8.40 in my
 friend's car. Normally the school bus 
 has already arrived and Julie, my     
 friend, usually meets me from the car.
 At 9.00 we go into school and have    
 registration to make sure people are  
 there. We have an assembly. We have   
 two songs a story and a prayer. At    
 9.30 we have creative writing. Then at
 10.00 we do S.R.A. or Comprehension   
 Plus. Then at 10.30 we have breaktime.
 After break we have maths or finish   
 off what we were doing before break.  
 At 12.00 we have dinner. Some have    
 dinners, some have packed lunch like  
 me. After lunch we do painting or     
 craft. Then after that it is          
 breaktime. We normally go on the      
 climbing frame. Afterwards we play    
 rounders then go home. We all enjoy   
 school. It is fun.
