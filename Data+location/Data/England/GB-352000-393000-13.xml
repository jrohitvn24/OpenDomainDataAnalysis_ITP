		<content>     The recent miner's strike over pit
 closures  which ran for  almost a full
 twelve months, affected the  people of
 this  area  acutely. As a  traditional
 mining  area,  the  area  around  our 
 school  is  still  the  home  of  many
 mining  families, who  suffered  great
 financial hardship. The  local Council
 was sensitive to  this  and  organised
 several  relief measures but attitudes
 were  hardened  politically  when  the
 National  Union of  Mineworkers failed
 to achieve their objective. In our own
 school, the  effects  were  felt.  The
 number of  pupils claiming free school
 meals  rose  dramatically,  stretching
 school  facilities  to  the  limit.   
 Tensions between  children of  working
 miners and those of strikers were also
 evident,  admittedly  on a small scale
 but it reflected the  divisions in the
 community over many months.           </content>
