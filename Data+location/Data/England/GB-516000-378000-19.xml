		<title>19HEALTH IN PANTON</title>
		<content>{PANTON}is a very isolated hamlet and  
 as such the health of its inhabitants 
 will depend on available services     
 being reached quickly and efficiently.
 Most residents of {PANTON}are in the  
 care of a doctor either at Wragby or  
 East Barkwith and surgeries are held  
 daily.Doctors will visit if requested 
 and if weather permits. Last year the 
 elderly mother of one resident was    
 dying and the doctor warned that the  
 visit he had just made would probably 
 be the last because the road          
 conditions were so bad. A chiropody   
 unit visits Wragby once a month and   
 residents with an appointment have to 
 make their own way there. There is a  
 hospital car service available if a   
 hospital appointment has to be kept   
 and the patient then contributes      
 towards the cost of the transport.
