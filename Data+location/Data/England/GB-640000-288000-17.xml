		<title>17 Beccles Childrens Clubs</title>
		<content> Following a survey of our class we    
found that the town has a lot to offer 
young children.                        
 BOYS-There are at least 4 groups of   
Cubs to join.Many belonged to Mini     
Rugby and Waveney Tigers Football or   
St Benets Football.                    
 GIRLS-Several go to the June Glennie  
Dancing School and ride at Holton.There
are some Brownie Packs to join.        
 BOTH-Very popular is the Kingfishers  
Swimming Club and the Athletic Club.A  
few take piano lessons and even fewer  
go to Sunday School at either Hungate  
Methodist Church or St Michaels.Some   
go to the Library club which is held in
the Gallery Room at the Library.       
 Many children have won rosettes,cups, 
certificates or medals for their       
particular activity which encourages   
them to continue eagerly.
