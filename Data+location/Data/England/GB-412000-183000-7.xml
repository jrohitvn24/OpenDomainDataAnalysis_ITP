 On Saturday morning I go to ballet    
 class and in the afternoon I go into  
 town or listen to records with my     
 friend. On Sundays my family go out   
 for a walk to Coate Water or visit    
 places like Avebury, Savernake Forest.
 We also go to the South Marsdon       
 Country Club for a swim.              </content>
