		<title>13POPULATION SURVEY IN ST.IVES</title>
		<content>  A "mini-survey" was carried out at   
 St.Ives comprehensive school to try to
 ascertain the number of pupils who    
 were indigenous to St.Ives.           
  Children were asked whether their    
 parents were similarly born in the    
 St.Ives area. We found that only{30%  
 of pupils questioned could say that   
 they and their parents were indigenous
 to the area.                          
  Of those children who said that      
 neither they, nor their parents were  
 from St.Ives,{most}said they had come 
 to live here because their parents    
 were connected in some way with the   
 holiday trade. It should be noted that
 the term 'most' is used as this was   
 only a rough survey and it was not    
 possible to  question fully all       
 pupils.                               
                                       
                                       </content>
