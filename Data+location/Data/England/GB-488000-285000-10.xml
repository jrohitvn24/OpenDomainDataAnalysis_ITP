   Mrs Warwick's ambition was to be a  
 trained nurse.She studied at CORBY    
 for three years until she achieved the
 position.Their pets were rabbits,     
 guinea pigs,pigs and other farm       
 animals which they kept in their      
 barn.There was a tan yard next to     
 Lomases farm.The men in the village   
 that didn't work on farms worked at   
 the stone quarries.The population at  
 that time was three hundred people.
