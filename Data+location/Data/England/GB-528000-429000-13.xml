		<content> The main local news for 1985 is as    
 follows:                              
 New housing development in South End  
 has caused much controversy.At a      
 Parish Council meeting objections were
 heard from village inhabitants and    
 noted.However the Parish Council      
 passed the planning application but   
 the Borough Council turned down the   
 application.This decision is now being
 appealed against.                     
 Mothers in the village have started a 
 Brownie Pack this year.They use the   
 School Hall as their meeting place.It 
 is hoped to begin Guides in 1986.     
 The school has taken part in the      
 B.B.C.Domesday project.The staff and  
 pupils have found it of great benefit 
 and interest.
