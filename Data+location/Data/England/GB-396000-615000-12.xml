		<title>12BROUGH LAW CAMPSITE</title>
		<content> Brough-law is a hill of 950' in the   
 east of the area looking down into the
 Ingram Valley. It is sometimes also   
 known as Ewe Hill. A popular footpath 
 takes visitors to the summit of this  
 hill. On the summit is a ring of      
 boulders up to 50m wide.This marks the
 position of an ancient campsite which 
 is thought to be at least 2000 yrs    
 old. There are actually two rings of  
 boulders around the gentler S and E   
 slopes. This was for added protection 
 against enemies. In the N and W where 
 the slopes are much steeper, there is 
 only one ring of stones. For even     
 greater protection,animals were herded
 between the two rings so that they    
 would give an alarm if intruders      
 attempted to attack the site. It is   
 thought that this was  not only an    
 ancient site but the site of an       
 ancient temple,                       </content>
