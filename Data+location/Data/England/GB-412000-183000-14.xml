		<content> The Prospect Foundation is a          
 registered charity, established in    
 1980 by local people to provide extra 
 care, support and fellowship for the  
 teminally ill and their families in   
 the Swindon area,free of charge.      
 The aim is to improve the dignity and 
 quality of life that remains by the   
 relief of pain, extra nursing support 
 and by the offer of friendship,       
 practical and spiritual help to the   
 patient and the family during the     
 period of illness.                    
 In 1985 a million pound appeal has    
 been launched to open a small         
 residential Hospice for those who need
 continuous nursing. Part of Victoria  
 hospital will be leased, staffed and  
 managed by the Foundation. The cost   
 will be met by charity.
