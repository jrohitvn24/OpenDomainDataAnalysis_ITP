		<title>14I remember Whittlesey</title>
		<content>   I've lived in Whittlesey all my life
 apart from four years when I was at   
 war. The town has changed, not just   
 the buildings but the people in them. 
 I could walk down to the cross and    
 know almost everybody I saw, now you  
 don't even know the traders on the    
 market stalls.                        
   I used to have a house that went    
 with my job but since I've retired we 
 have moved to this sheltered housing  
 we have a warden who comes in and     
 checks everything is alright.         
   Until two years ago I had a car but 
 when that failed its M.O.T. we sold   
 it, but I have always used my bike for
 going around locally.                 
   I don't think they were the good old
 days, if you had ever worked like I've
 worked on farms where almost every job
 was done by hand then you'd see how   
 well off people are today.            </content>
