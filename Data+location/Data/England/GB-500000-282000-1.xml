		<title>01WADENHOE  BLOCK  SUMMARY</title>
		<content>  In the Wadenhoe area the main type of
 land use is for farm crops other than 
 grass, followed by enclosed rough     
 grazing. The land overall is not built
 up although there are the villages of 
 Aldwincle, Lilford,Pilton and         
 Wadenhoe.The population figures from  
 1981 were :- Aldwincle 310, Lilford   
 79, Pilton 62, and Wadenhoe 101.      
  As you can see from the above figures
 the population of the area is only    
 542. There are not a lot of amenities 
 in the area, but there is the local   
 river Nene, where boating,swimming,   
 canoeing, fishing and walking can take
 place.There is also Lilford Park with 
 its wide selection of animals ranging 
 from mice to horses and from budgies  
 to vultures. If you want a day out    
 there then you could spend it by the  
 Wadenhoe riverside near the pub and   
 church picnicking.                    </content>
