		<title>08LANWADES BUSINESS PARK</title>
		<content>In Kentford a Business Park has        
recently opened, where about 31 offices
are rented out to people doing         
business. They always interview the    
people before renting the offices out  
to them, to make sure that they fall   
into the sort of class that they want. 
The people who rent the offices are    
usually in 3-4 days a week. Most of the
offices are rented out for a period of 
6 months, which then goes down to 3    
months, after a period of a year,      
although the longest lease is 25 years.
The Newmarket area is good to work in, 
because there is peace and quiet. Some 
of the businesses include: workshops,  
laboratories, hand painting figurines, 
upholstery etc.. The land, which was   
taken over from Dalgety Spillers 18    
months ago once belonged to Lanwades   
Park.
