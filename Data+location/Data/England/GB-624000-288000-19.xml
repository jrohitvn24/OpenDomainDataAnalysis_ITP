 various forms of{handicrafts.}There

 embroidery.{Old skills}such as        
 spinning,weaving,smocking &amp; tapestry  
 work still survive.Some men still     
 carve wood.One man has turned wood-   
 turning on a lathe,into a cottage     
 industry.Another woman has developed  
 her own designs on a knitting machine 
 &amp; also has a small{business}selling   
 her goods by mail order.Most women    
 cook of course,one women has a        
 business decorating cakes for special 
 occasions,the results can truly be
