		<title>20A Teenager's Saturday.</title>
		<content>     On Saturdays I get up later about 
 8.30am.I have a shower and wash my    
 hair and breakfast (muesli,toast and  
 tea.)I dress in my tennis whites and  
 go with my friend and her father to   
 Keynsham for tennis lessons.We knock  
 up then go into a tournament.After I'm
 always thirsty so we get a can of coke
 in the park.My little sister and I    
 have pet hamsters so we clean out the 
 cages,give them fresh bedding and food
 and play with them whilst we wait for 
 our elder brother to come home from   
 school and my Dad to finish at the    
 surgery.In the afternoon,I go shopping
 in Bristol to spend my Â£2 pocket      
 money.The bus fare costs 55p. and I   
 can buy one of "Frankie Goes To       
 Hollywood"'s singles for Â£1.45.Bristol
 is full of street sellers and gangs   
 dressed in Punk and Mod gear showing  
 off. By Sarah Hoare (13 years old)    </content>
