		<content> Woke up at 6.45 a.m. switched on the  
 radio and teasmade and enjoyed a cup  
 of tea while listening to the news.   
 Ater breakfast a phone call confirmed 
 the time I would collect a friend for 
 a doctor's appointment in Wainfleet.  
 Just as I was leaving another friend  
 rang to see if I could go with her to 
 Boston. This was impossible as I have 
 to play the organ for a funeral at 11 
 a.m. Fortunately my "meals on wheels" 
 rota does not occur this Thursday.    
 Remember that tomorrow the Library Van
 calls and to decide on the food for   
 the weekend for my Canadian visitors. 
 Prepare guest room after dinner. Went 
 to the Vicarage for choir practice at 
 6.30 followed by 7 o'clock Communion  
 Bible Study and Discussion Group and  
 then to bed.
