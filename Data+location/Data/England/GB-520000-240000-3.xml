		<title>03HINXWORTH AREA : EDWORTH</title>
		<content> Edworth is a small agricultural parish
 of 1122 acres with the A1 forming the 
 SW boundary. Only a few of the        
 original houses of the village remain 
 and are scattered about the parish.   
 The more modern village consists of   
 late 19th century houses and some 20th
 century bungalows almost all of which 
 are owned by the farms and rented out.
 Few of the inhabitants now work on the
 land due to mechanisation. Most have  
 cars because public transport is      
 limited. The land is almost entirely  
 given over to corn growing and cattle 
 grazing. The church which stood in its
 present position in 1200 AD was       
 restored 10 years ago but is now      
 redundant. With most houses 'off the  
 beaten track' a stranger to the area  
 might drive through Edworth without   
 realising. The population is less then
 50 but has recently stopped declining.</content>
