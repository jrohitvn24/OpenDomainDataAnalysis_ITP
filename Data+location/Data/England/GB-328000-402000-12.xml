		<title>12ALTCAR TAVR CAMP</title>
		<content>   This{Army Camp}was established      
 during the{1st World War.}Between the 
 Wars the{West Lancashire Territorial  
 and{Volunteer Reserve Association}were
 given the land by{Lord Derby}and the  
 camp as we see it today was built.    
   The camp today is used by Regular   
 and T.A. units of the Army, Royal Air 
 Force and Royal Navy as well as by    
 Cadet Forces. It can claim to be one  
 of the leading centres in the country 
 for small arms training as it has an  
 electronic target range.              
   It is administered by{Civil Servants
 and commanded by a retired Colonal.   
 The sand dune areas give an excellent 
 training area and in the{1939-'45     
 period were used for both{tank}and    
{infantry training.}The area is        
 surrounded by firing point lookouts   
 when exercises are in progress. The   
 Queen visited on the 25th June 1985.  </content>
