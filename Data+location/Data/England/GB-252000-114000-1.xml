		<title>01GENERAL OVERVIEW OF BEAFORD</title>
		<content>   Beaford is a small village situated 
 on the B3220 road 5 miles from Great  
 Torrington and 7 miles from Winkleigh.
 The electoral roll for the parish     
 contained 283 names.  The area is     
 undulating countryside, mainly        
 pasture-land for dairying, beef and   
 sheep. Some arable land is used for   
 crops of roots and corns, used chiefly
 for winter feed of stock.             
   The village is situated on higher   
 land above the River Torridge, at     
 about 350 feet above sea level.       
 Valleys are quite steep, and a feature
 of the area is its hills and valleys, 
 with copses of deciduous trees and fir
 plantations interspersed amongst the  
 farm lands.  Plant growth is generally
 lush and rich, the area averaging some
 40 inches of rain per year.  Most     
 roads beyond the main road are very   
 narrow, often only single track.      </content>
