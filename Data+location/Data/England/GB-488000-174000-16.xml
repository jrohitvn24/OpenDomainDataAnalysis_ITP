		<title>16Foliejon Park Farm-2.</title>
		<content> The land is ploughed in the autumn and
 the winter wheat is sown soon after.  
 When we visited the farm{wheat}was    
 growing in 150 acres. There were 100  
 acres of barley,40 of oats,30 of broad
 beans,100 of grass and 20 were fallow.
 Most of the grass is mown to provide  
 hay for the animals.It is baled and   
 stored in the large barns with the    
 help of an elevator.The remaining     
{grass}is used for pasture.When the    
 crops have been harvested they are    
 dried in an oil fired grain drier. The
 grain is then fine-milled for feeding 
 to the animals. A mill and mix feed is
 given to the pigs. The{oats and barley
 pass through a crusher and are fed to 
 the cattle with{added minerals.}Much  
 machinery is used on the farm, the    
 diesal-driven tractors are used with  
 various attachments such as a plough,a
 harrow, a cultivator and a drill.     </content>
