		<title>04FARMING: NATIONAL TRUST</title>
		<content> To the north of the A458 road and west
 of Burnt Tree/King Street road the    
 land belongs to{The National Trust    
 based at Attingham Hall. There are 6  
 farms:{Lower Betton, Cronkhill,       
{Cotons, Lower Cound, Upper Brompton   
 and{Lower Brompton.}Only the latter   
 farm is tenant farmed. This farm is   
 close to the River Severn and is the  
 only farm in the whole area that has  
 large amounts of grassland for hay.   
 This is because it is still a{dairy   
 farm with{friesian cattle.}The other  
 farms have in the last 3 years reduced
 their livestock and have become{arable
 based farms. Major crops are{barley,  
{wheat and sugar beet.}The barley, much
 autumn sown, is for malting and the   
 sugar beet is taken to Allscott Sugar 
 Beet Factory ten miles away.
