		<content> Tower Bridge attracts many visitors   
especially as you can now walk along   
the highest level. London Bridge is    
new; the old one was sold to the United
States a few years ago.                
 Some places are not so famous but just
as interesting. Saint Dunstan in the   
East is an old church badly damaged in 
1941 during the Blitz. It was not      
rebuilt, but the Worshipful Company    
of Gardeners has planted many flowers  
and trees; the small chapel is still   
open for silent prayer.                
 Some guilds are still thriving like   
the Watermen's Guild in                
St.Mary-at-Hill.                       
 Occasionally you can see metal studs  
in the pavement. These show that the   
ground belongs to the owners of the    
adjoining  building.
