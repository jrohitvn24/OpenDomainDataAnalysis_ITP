		<title>18RUTH'S DAY-  SW.BOGNOR REGIS</title>
		<content> My day begins at 8am when I get up for
 school.I wash and dress myself and    
 then eat my breakfast.Before going    
 to school I get my baby rabbit out of 
 his hutch. I either walk to school or 
 cycle with my mum who is a housewife. 
 If it is raining I usually go in the  
 car with my dad if he hasn't already  
 left for work.He works either at a    
 factory or he helps with work on      
 removals.It is about three quarters of
 a  mile to school.The bell goes at 9am
 and then we have registration and     
 assembly.At lunchtime I have my own   
 sandwiches.School finishes at 3.30pm  
 and if I am not staying for a club I  
 arrive home at about 3.55pm.I then get
 changed and play with my friend from  
 next door.Instead of having tea in the
 afternoon we have dinner as all my    
 family have sandwiches in the middle  
 of the day.I go to bed at 9.30-10.00. </content>
