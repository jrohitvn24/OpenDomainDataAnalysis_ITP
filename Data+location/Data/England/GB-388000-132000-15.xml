 They had paraffin lamps and candles   
 which they went to bed with. The      
 Parish Council put street lights in   
 for winter use. A man had to fill them
 every day with oil. They had to get   
 water from the well. The lavatory was 
 at the bottom of the garden and had to
 be emptied.

 They had candles and a big paraffin   
 lamp in the middle of the table       
 where they did sewing and school      
 lessons. They had to get water from a 
 well but a standpipe was put in across
 the road in about 1925. On Sunday     
 night they had to carry water back for
 the washing the next day. The lavatory
 was at the top of the garden. You had 
 to take a lantern because it was so   
 dark. You could hear the people in    
 next door's lavatory.                 </content>
