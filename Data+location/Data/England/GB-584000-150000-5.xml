		<title>05KINGSWOOD NEW HOUSING ESTATE</title>
		<content> Probably the greatest change is found 
 at Kingswood. Until post-war years    
 this had few soundly built houses, the
 majority being wooden frame buildings 
 (shacks) separated from their         
 neighbours by considerable distances  
 in many instances.  Today most of     
 these have gone and in their place    
 expensive and attractive houses have  
 been erected.  Much of this, however, 
 is outside the coverage of this block.
 Many of the old houses are being      
 renovated (often at great expense) and
 are very attractive to look at while  
 retaining their original character.   
 This has been made possible by the    
 sale of woodland from Leeds Castle    
 estate.
