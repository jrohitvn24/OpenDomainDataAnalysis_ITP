       Downe House is important to     
 local history because it was the home 
 of Charles Darwin but now it is owned 
 by the Royal College of Surgeons.     
 Darwin lived at Downe House for 40    
 years until he died in 1882.  In this 
 historic house, you can see his study,
 his microscope and the tools he used  
 .  The most valuable exhibit is the   
 original log of the voyage of 'The    
 Beagle'.  The oldest object  is the   
 fossil jawbone of the Megatherium     
 which Darwin found in Argentina. There
 is also a Galapagos tortoise which is 
 100 years old.  In the garden there is
 a mulberry tree which is over 300     
 years old and the worm stone which was
 used to find how earth worms move     
 soil. Each year 9 to 10,000 visitors  
 come which is important for tourism.  </content>
