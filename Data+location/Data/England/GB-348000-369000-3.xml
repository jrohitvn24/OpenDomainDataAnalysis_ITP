		<content> During the summer you see many        
 butterflies including painted lady,red
 admiral, peacock, small tortoishell,  
 cabbage white, small blue and orange  
 tip. There are many other different   
 insects living on the wide range of   
 plant life in our district. There is  
 mixed farming in this area and you    
 will see grass, wheat, barley and     
 potatoes growing in fields. The       
 grasses we found growing along the    
 brook are couch, rye, fescues, meadow 
 grasses and cocks foot.In some of the 
 fields there are rooks of thistles. In
 the hedges grow poppies, wild roses   
 and horsetails. The trees are mainly  
 oak, sycamore, ash, poplar, pussy     
 willow and elder.There are at least   
 six badger sets near the village and  
 lots of foxes and once they stole the 
 school hens so we got some more.
