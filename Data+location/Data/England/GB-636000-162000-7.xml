		<content>Our area took in part of the shopping  
area.We interviewed the managers of the
3 largest shops -Waitrose,Woolworth and
Tesco. Local people said that their    
main shopping day was either Friday    
[34%] or Thursday[33%]. Bulk food      
shopping was done at Waitrose [40%] &amp;  
Tesco [24%]. With the possibility of   
shops opening on Sundays, 51% liked    
the idea but 26% did not. None of the  
managers wanted Sunday opening but felt
that they would have to open "if the   
opposition did". Computers were being  
used increasingly in stock ordering    
and checking,but none of the  managers 
could foresee an early  introduction   
of the new electronic tills which      
"read" bar-codes on goods.In addition  
to full-time  staff,part-time shelf-   
fillers were needed. Best selling      
goods are butter,  margarine, cereals, 
tea, coffee,biscuits and frozen foods. </content>
