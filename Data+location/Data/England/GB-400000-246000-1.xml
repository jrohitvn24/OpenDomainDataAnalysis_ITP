		<title>01Norton and Lenchwick Index</title>
		<content>   This area containing the small      
 villages of Norton and Lenchwick in   
 Worcestershire is mainly rural.The    
 land to the south is the flood plain  
 of the river Avon.From this point a   
 steep scarp rises with two prominent  
 hills,Craycombe and Tunnel,these being
 wooded.From the top of the scarp the  
 land continues to rise being given    
 over to mainly arable and fruit       
 farming.                              
   There is little habitation but one  
 building,Wood Norton Hall,because of  
 it's associations with the past and   
 the present,has a fascinating story to
 tell.                                 
   Road,river and rail communications  
 link Evesham,Pershore and Worcester.  
 These are all contained on and        
 slightly above the flood plain of the 
 river.
