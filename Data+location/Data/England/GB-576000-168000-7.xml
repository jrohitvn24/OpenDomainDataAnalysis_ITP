		<title>07Buying a house in 1985</title>
		<content> Buying a house in 1985 can be quite a 
 task. My enquiries in Gillingham      
 showed I could buy a house for Â£23,995
 I wrote to a Building Society and an  
 Estate Agent. I was told I would need 
 a loan which I would pay back over 25 
 or 30 years. My house is quite a large
 house because seven people live in it.
 We have got double glazing and we have
 an extention. We have five bedrooms,  
 two bathrooms, two toilets, with a    
 kitchen, lounge, diningroom, stairs   
 and a passage which the cats sleep in 
 and a freezer room.                   
 In our kitchen we have all the modern 
 gadgets like a dishwasher, washing    
 machine, microwave oven, oven, fridge 
 freezer, electric sandwich toaster,   
 toaster, electric kettle, sodastream, 
 an electric potato peeler and a mixer.
 In the dining room we have a colour   
 TV, two computers and a record player.</content>
