		<content> Bellingham's pub owners and landlords 
 have remained in the same trade for   
 several years.Local employees work    
 only on a part-time basis as a        
 rule.Beverages come from Newcastle but
 food products particularly meats,that 
 is game and fish are bought locally   
 when possible.The building of Kielder 
 Dam has had little effect on summer   
 trade,but visitors do still come to   
 Bellingham in the summer which is the 
 busiest time of year.                 
   All landlords/publicans expect a    
 gradual change to take place in       
 Bellingham. They all feel that        
 Bellingham is a very pleasant place to
 live but they would all like better   
 trading publicity in future.
