		<title>0420TH CENT.CHANGES IN RAINHAM</title>
		<content>We spoke to Mrs.Wheeler and Mrs Bunting
of Longford Court Old Peoples Home.They
said that Rainham had once been a small
village with only 2 schools.One school 
was near the Station and had 6 classes.
Pupils wrote on slates and there were  
{60 children} in each class.They did   
not have any lunch canteen.54 years    
ago a main drainage system was         
built.Some houses were very poor,with  
houses built of {cow dung.}            
   Many people went {fruit picking} in 
the local farms.Apples,cherries,Hops   
and Raspberries were common.On windy   
days the pickers had to be tied to the 
ladders so that they did not fall to   
the ground.                            
   At school many games were popular   
some which we still play today.They    
played {hopscotch,marbles and spinning 
tops}.The ladies also remembered the   
{Trams} that ran from Gillingham.      </content>
