		<title>07Housing Questionnaire Data.</title>
		<content> The following points emerged from a   
 'housing' questionnaire distributed in
 Mattishall on July 10th.1985.         
    Most dwellings in the village are  
 either bungalows or detached houses.  
 There is a tremendous age range:a     
 great deal of building has occurred   
 within the last ten to twenty years,  
 but there are also a large number of  
 houses between 100 and 400 years old. 
    Most people live in accomodation   
 with three living rooms and three     
 bedrooms,and most dwellings have      
 garages.The average number of         
 inhabitants per dwelling is four.     
 The inhabitants of the village are in 
 the main relative newcomers:few have  
 lived here for more than ten years.   
    Gardens in Mattishall are fairly   
 large,averaging about a quarter of an 
 acre.                                 
                                       </content>
