		<title>09SOCIAL ACTIVITIES,  BROMPTON</title>
		<content> Some people think that villages are   
 quiet places and that nothing goes on 
 in a village! When we looked at the   
 social activities we have in Brompton 
 we thought a lot goes on.             
   We have a church, a sunday school,  
 a Primary School, a Special School,a  
 pub, a gourmet restaurant, Brownies,  
 Cubs,Scouts and Guides, a football    
 club, a cricket club (which runs 5    
 teams), a tennis court, keep fit      
 class, dominoes and darts teams, a    
 local history society, a W.I.,a       
 gardening club, a pony club, Mother's 
 union, Over sixties club, a           
 Conservative association and an       
 evening group.                        
    We have a village fete day, village
 sports, church garden fetes, village  
 barbecue, Derwent Hunt Fayre and a    
 Garden show annually.                 
 There is never a dull moment here!    </content>
