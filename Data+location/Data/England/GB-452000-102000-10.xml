		<content> Mark's Tey Apple Farm is off          
 Titchfield Road near the Old Church.  
 The present owner is an ex-Naval      
 Commander.The Apple Farm was started  
 before the Second World War.          
 The Apple Farm consists of 8 acres    
 with apple trees and 2 acres for the  
 house and gardens.                    
 The apples grown are mainly eating    
 apples with some cooking varieties.   
 They are graded and then sold direct  
 to the public from their own shop.    
 Trade has fallen during the years as  
 housing has encroached and residents  
 have complained about the spraying of 
 the trees.Other housing has hidden    
 the farm from the road so advertising 
 is more expensive.                    
 The owner has applied for planning    
 permission for the land but at the    
 moment plans have been turned down.   
 Coxes Orange Pippin are the main crop.</content>
