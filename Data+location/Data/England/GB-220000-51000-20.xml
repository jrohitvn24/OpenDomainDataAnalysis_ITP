		<content> In the Corner Game,the boys chase the 
 girls.When the girls are caught,they  
 are put in the corner.When all are    
 caught,the girls chase the boys etc.. 
 In the T.V.Game,one person has to call
 out first letters of a programme and  
 say the channel and time.The rest have
 to guess the programme.The person who 
 guesses has to run up and down        
 shouting the name.It is then his turn 
 to choose the programme.In Stuck In   
 The Mud,one person is it and they     
 chase the rest.If caught you stand    
 with legs astride and someone crawls  
 through.If caught three times,you're  
 "It".In Arky,someone counts to a      
 number,the rest hide.If found they    
 race to a post.If they reach it they  
 say "Arky,Arky,1,2,3,in".If you're    
 caught,the catcher says "Arky,Arky,   
 1,2,3,out",and you become the catcher,
 and the game starts again.            </content>
