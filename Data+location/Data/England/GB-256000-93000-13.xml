		<title>13INDUSTRY IN OKEHAMPTON</title>
		<content> The 'pie factory' or McVites employs  
 350 people which makes it the biggest 
 employer in West Devon. McVites make  
 cheese cakes etc., for Marks and      
 Spencer and other food products for   
 Ross frozen foods. Large trucks come  
 in and out all the time to bring raw  
 materials and take products to the    
 shops. This once, small local firm is 
 now part of the United Biscuit empire.
 Other industries include Spinks food  
 processing, who are building a new    
 factory on the Exeter Road Industrial 
 Estate, Lowfield distribution and     
 Ravensail boat builders making sailing
 dinghies among others. The local      
 authority employ many people at West  
 Devon Council at its Okehampton       
 offices and depot, and Okehampton     
 College. Out side the town the farming
 is the most important industry,       
 although there is also some quarrying.</content>
