		<title>01A First Look at our District</title>
		<content> Tadley is surrounded mainly by rural  
 areas.Very little of the district is  
 covered by residential development.The
 vicinity is mainly dominated by       
 forestland.                           
 Your first impression of our area will
 depend on which way you enter.The     
 north side of our environment is      
 mostly residential.The southern part  
 of our environment is mainly rural.The
 central section is deciduous woodland.
 It was once owned by royalty but,now  
 it is a nature reserve.               
 We have many agricultural sections in 
 our district.Tadley is the centre of  
 our residential development.          
 The main road through our vicinity is 
 the{A340.}Apart from this there are no
 other main roads but the vicinity is  
 criss-crossed with minor roads.
