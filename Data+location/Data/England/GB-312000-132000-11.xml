		<content> The Coles' farm has got a dog called  
 Badger and  some calves.    The calves
 are one year old.The calves  were big 
 for their age.The lambs were playing  
 in their pens.The cows on the farm are
 Friesians. The chickens have trick    
 eggs to make them lay eggs.The breed  
 of sheep are BORDER LEICESTER crossed 
 with Suffolk.                         
 There are some bees on the farm.      
 The bees have one hive and they get in
 a crack.                              
 The cows have to be milked every day  
 in the morning and maybe midday.{     
{The cows eat grass silage and         
 they sleep on straw.                  
 The sheep have to be sheered in summer
 so they are not so hot.The wool gets  
 made into sheepskin rugs, coats,      
 boots. The wool is also used for      
 jumpers gloves scarfs  and knitting   
 wool. Sheep are very handy and useful.</content>
