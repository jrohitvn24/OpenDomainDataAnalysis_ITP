		<content> The D block which we have named       
 Lickey/Catshill lies 13 miles SW of   
 Birmingham in the extreme NE corner of
 the County Council of Hereford and    
 Worcester. The town of Bromsgrove is  
 located to the SW. This area divides  
 into roughly two halves.            { 
{1.To the east}are the woods and       
 large country houses of Barnt Green   
 and Lickey and{to the north}the       
 lower slopes of the Lickey Hills      
 where Birmingham city_dwellers still  
 come to find open spaces and fine     
 scenery.                              
{2.To the west and south               
 the largest areas of population       
 comprise the more closely_packed      
 housing of Catshill and Marlbrook with
 the A38 trunk road to Bromsgrove and  
 the SW and the M5 motorway from       
 junction 4 leading to Droitwich and   
 the SW.                               </content>
