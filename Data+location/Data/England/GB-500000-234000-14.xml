  IN DRY SEASONS SOME CROP FAILURE IS  
 LIKELY IN THE LIGHT SOIL, AS THERE IS 
 NO IRRIGATION. THERE ARE NO LAKES NOR 
 SUBSTATIAL RIVERS IN THE AREA, AND    
 ALTHOUGH FARMERS HAVE TRIED VARIOUS   
 METHODS OF IRRIGATION ALL HAVE PROVED 
 TOO COSTLY.                           
  THERE ARE A FEW PRIVATELY OWNED SMALL
 HOLDINGS, ONE OF WHICH PRODUCES SOFT  
 FRUIT WHERE CUSTOMERS PICK THEIR OWN  
 PURCHASES.                            
  IN 1919 A TOTAL OF 272 ACRES, 140    
 ACRES NORTH OF FLITWICK WOOD AND 132  
 ACRES AT FROGHALL, WAS BOUGHT FROM THE
 DUKE OF BEDFORD BY THE COUNCIL. THIS  
 WAS USED TO PROVIDE RETURNING LOCAL   
 EX-SERVICE MEN WITH 1 OR 2 ACRES EACH.
 SOME LAND WAS STILL HELD IN THIS WAY  
 UNTIL THE 1950S.
