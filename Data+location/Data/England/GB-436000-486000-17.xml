		<title>17THORNTON LE MOOR VILLAGE (2)</title>
		<content> We went down the backlane in the      
 village and the flowers on the banks  
 and in the hedges that we saw were,   
 vetch,brambles,elderberries dogrose,  
 bird's eye and clover! We went down   
 the lane that leads away from the     
 piggeries and saw cultivated fields.  
 The crops growing were wheat and      
 barley.                               
 On the bank at the east of the village
 were several new trees. These had been
 planted by the children of the        
 village. By each tree was a little    
 plaque giving the name of the children
 who had planted it. There were also   
 roses planted around the village seat 
 and in the spring daffodils grow in   
 the grass verges on the approach roads
 into the village.                     
 Many houses in the village use to have
 a well in their gardens,as the village
 has a high water-table.               </content>
