		<title>02Haytor granite tramway</title>
		<content> Just to the north of Haytor rocks can 
 be seen the disused remains of        
 granite quarries and a granite        
 tramway.  The tramway was used from   
 1825 to 1858 to carry the stone down  
 to the valley at Teigngrace where it  
 was shipped on barges via Stover Canal
 and the River Teign to Teignmouth and 
 loading onto sea-going vessels. The   
 quarry became uneconomical to work as 
 a result of the double shipping       
 transfers.  According to Brian        
 leMessurier's Dartmoor guide book,    
 'Walks for Motorists' the granite     
 tramway "reverses the normal railway  
 technique which has the flange on the 
 wheels and employs simple rails.  Here
 the retaining flange was on the rails,
 or sets, and the material was         
 available for the cost of extraction."
