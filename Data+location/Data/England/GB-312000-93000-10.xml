		<content>{The following account is by two boys  
{who often play within the block:      
{  }When we get time we go down to the 
 stream near Home Farm to build camps  
 and bridges. Often we go out on nature
 rambles to see how many wild species  
 we can spot. The most common birds    
 around Big Wood and Bald Hill is the  
 Buzzard. Often the Red Fox and the Red
 Deer are seen.  Every year a{pheasant 
{shoot}is organised. The pheasants are 
 bred by the people who live up the    
 Manor. People are asked to become     
 beaters for the shoot which travels   
 around Big Wood and part of East hill.
   To-day (24th October,1985) as we    
 travelled to school the first of the  
 fox hounds were being gathered        
 together for the annual{hunt}in our   
 area. We like this area because nature
 is abundant and we like wildlife.
