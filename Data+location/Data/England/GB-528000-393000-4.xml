		<content> When I was 8 years old I used to play 
 games like snakes and ladders but now 
 I am 11 I do jig-saws,play monopoly   
 and listen to tapes.My favourite toys 
 are my bike and my computer,which is a
 Commodore 64.I have got about 74 games
 for it.My favourite games are Bruce   
 Lee or Frogger.The first game I got   
 for my computer was Frogger and the   
 last one I got was Bruce Lee.I have   
 had my computer for about two years   
 now.I use my bike and computer the    
 most of all.My sister uses toys like  
 dolls and board games like Donkey     
 Kong.My sister and I don't usually    
 play with our toys together because we
 are usually playing with somebody else
 or falling out with each other.
