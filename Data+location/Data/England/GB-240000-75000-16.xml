		<content> Both hedge and tree nesting birds     
 find suitable cover, and the bird     
 population is swelled by migrant      
 visitors both winter and summer. The  
 richness of the food chain can be     
 indicated by the number of birds of   
 prey - mainly buzzards and owls which 
 are supported by the area. A dash of  
 exotica is also added by the large    
 number of escapee pheasants throughout
 the year.                             
 Butterflies and moths also find the   
 climate suitable to both winter       
 hibernation and summer migration, and 
 hundreds of insects nd bugs exist in  
 large numbers.                        
 The wild flowers include most types   
 which grow in pasture,woodland,meadow-
 land and hedgebank situations. Trees  
 include oak,beech,sycamore,ash,willow,
 horse-chestnut,hazel and holly, also  
 more recently- coniferous plantations.</content>
