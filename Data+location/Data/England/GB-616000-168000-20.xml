		<title>20HERNE BAY THIRTY YEARS AGO</title>
		<content> To gain some idea of changes in Herne 
 Bay since the Coronation of 1953      
 children asked anyone in their family 
 who remembered the town at this time  
 for their impressions. The main one   
 was that old Herne Bay had so much    
 more life and vitality about it in the
 Summer. There used to be so many      
 people along the sea front sitting in 
 deckchairs, walking, drinking tea. For
 the swimmers there were a series of   
 rafts anchored off-shore. Along the   
 pier a small steam train pulled open  
 carriages of passengers to meet the   
 steamer. On the shore was the Punch   
 and Judy man who also gave a magic    
 show. From the beaches pleasure boats 
 took people for an hours ride. There  
 would be a Summer Show in the Pier    
 Pavilion and music in the bandstand.  
 The only note of caution was that we  
 only remember the sunny days.         </content>
