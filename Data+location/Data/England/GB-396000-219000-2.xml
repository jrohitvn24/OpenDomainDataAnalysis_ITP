		<content>  The name Charlton Kings is derived   
 from "Ceorlton" meaning 'a peasant's  
 farmstead belonging to the Crown (as  
 opposed to a monastery)". Old         
 industries can be seen in local names:
 Ryeworth was an enclosure for growing 
 rye; Sappercombe was the soap-makers  
 valley and Crab End was where the crab
 apples were grown. Battledown was a   
 farmstead or tun belonging to Badella.
  The oldest surviving building is the 
 parish church, St Mary's, which was   
 started in 1190. In 1290 a chantry    
 chapel was added with a priest's room 
 above, of which the fireplace and     
 half-timbering are still visible. A   
 piscina in the chapel has an ogee arch
 which allows accurate dating. The     
 tower was built in 1390. As the       
 congregation grew, the church was     
 extended and galleries added until a  
 major rebuilding in Victorian times.  </content>
