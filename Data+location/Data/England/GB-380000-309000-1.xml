 Bishops Wood is a small rural village 
 on the Staffordshire-Shropshire       
 border.                               
 Most of the houses are modern,detached
 residences, with some semi-detached   
 and a few of the original cottages.   
 The nearest large town is Telford,    
 which is eleven miles away.           
 There are few purpose-built facilities
 in the village.  It has a church, one 
 pub and one Post Office incorporated  
 in the Farm Shop.  Villages provide a 
 lot of home-made entertainment.  There
 is an entertainments committee which  
 organises dances, quizzes and so on.  
 From a sample survey we discovered    
 that over three-quarters of the       
 population travel over 10 miles to    
 work.  We would say that it is a      
 commuter village.
