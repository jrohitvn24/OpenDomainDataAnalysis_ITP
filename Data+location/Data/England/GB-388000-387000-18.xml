		<title>18ST. GEORGE'S CHURCH</title>
		<content> George Fearn, a wealthy brewer,       
 donated money to build this church    
 which was one of many built in the    
 19th Century as the industrial towns  
 of Northern England expanded. The     
 church is built of Runcorn stone. It  
 is 55m wide and 23m long. Its tower   
 and spire rise 72m above the A6 road. 
 A particularly interesting feature is 
 the miniature stone replica of the    
 tower and spire built by the          
 architect, Austin, over the founders  
 grave in 1910 in the cemetery across  
 the road.                             
 The church has many interesting       
 features, a nave, porches decorated by
 gargoyles, a font, pulpit and         
 ornate windows depicting figures      
 symbolic of the Faith.                
 The church was consecrated on 25th    
 February 1897 and is a thriving parish
 church today.                         </content>
