		<title>18FARMS AROUND FLAMSTEAD</title>
		<content> In Flamstead the main farm lands are  
 crops like wheat,oats,barley and      
 corn.My Grandad owns a farm.It is     
 called Woodend Farm.My dad lived there
 when he was little.It is mostly crops.
 They have bullocks,sheep,chickens,    
 ducks and geese.In the olden days cows
 were milked by hand and stool and     
 bucket.Now they are milked by machine.
 The milk is stored in a churn.Jersey  
 cows give the creamiest milk.Sheep    
 give you meat and wool.Probably the   
 busiest time is Harvest.The farmers go
 backwards and forwards in tractors or 
 on the combine which is very dusty.   
 They burn the stubble and put dirt    
 around the edge of the field so the   
 fire doesn't spread.Obviously         
 machinery is now very important to our
 farmers.
