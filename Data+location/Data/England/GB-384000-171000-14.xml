		<content> The Women's Institute meets each month
 in the school.Meetings begin with     
 business comprising mainly notices of 
 forthcoming events and projects at    
 local,group,county and national       
 levels.(Members join in county events 
 including  tennis and skittles). This 
 is followed by a social time during   
 which light refreshments are served by
 members on a rota basis. Finally the  
 invited speaker entertains and/or     
 informs on subjects varying from      
 wholemeal cookery to hypnotherapy,

 money for W.I. funds. Members also    
 raise village funds by organising teas
 for visitors to the annual Village    
 Fete. A mystery coach tour followed a 
 tea prepared by members is given      
 annually for senior citizens.         </content>
