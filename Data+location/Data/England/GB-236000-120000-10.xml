		<content>   The houses in our block are a       
 mixture of styles and types.Some are  
 made of brick and cob but most are    
 made of stone.There are about 90_100  
 houses in the village: there are      
 bungalows, cottages, semi_detached and
 detached houses.  About half of these 
 are modern, built in the last ten     
 years. The rest are older, some being 
 very old indeed (The Bell Inn is the  
 oldest at about 700 years old and is  
 the only thatched builing in the      
 village).                             
                                       
   The population of the village is    
 about 150. The inhabitants either work
 in farming related industries, service
 industries or in offices and          
 businesses in the surrounding towns   
 of Bideford,Torrington and Barnstaple.
