 people in the Shrewsbury area than any
 other employer.Teachers,administrators
 ,parks attendants and maintainence men
 are but a few of those employed.

 by{Perkins}engine builders and        
{Shrewsbury Tool and Die.}Numbers      
 employed in manufacturing vary        
 throughout the year according to the  
 orders placed with each company.      
{Unemployment}in the area is well below
 the national average at 12%.To assist 
 those out of work the{Job Centre}in   
 the{Square}is open five days a week.  
 Each day they receive twenty to thirty
 descriptions of job vacancies of which
 they are proud of filling 75%.Despite 
 this success the unemployment figures
