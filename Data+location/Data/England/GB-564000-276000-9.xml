    I GET UP AT 7 O'CLOCK AND SLUMP    
DOWNSTAIRS.  FOR BREAKFAST I HAVE      
CORNFLAKES AND COLD MILK. DAD YELLS,   
"THE BUS WILL SOON BE HERE". I HURRY   
UPSTAIRS,TRYING TO FIND MY CLOTHES.WHEN
I AM READY I GO TO THE BUS STOP AND    
CHAT TO MY FRIENDS TILL THE BUS COMES. 
    WHEN I GET TO SCHOOL I PLAY UNTIL  
MR.DAVIES BLOWS THE WHISTLE AND WE     
TROOP INSIDE.THE OTHER CHILDREN READ   
WHILE I TAKE THE DINNER REGISTER ROUND.
    THEN WE GO INTO THE HALL FOR       
ASSEMBLY. MR.DAVIES READS A STORY AND  
SAYS A PRAYER. THEN WE GO TO OUR       
CLASSROOM FOR MATHS, GAMES AND         
PUZZLES. PLAY TIME FOLLOWS. THEN WE    
WRITE STORIES.                         
    AFTER LUNCH,IT IS GAMES. I PLAY    
CRICKET,IT IS REALLY FUN. AFTER GAMES  
WE LISTEN TO A STORY. I GO HOME ON THE 
BUS,THINKING OF ALL I HAVE DONE TODAY. </content>
