		<title>05FARMING AT FROXFIELD GREEN-2</title>
		<content> The crops grown are many and are      
 mainly wheat and barley with varying  
 'break-crops'. These do not use as    
 many nutrients from the ground so     
 providing a break. The crops to make  
 a break are oats, oil-seed-rape,      
 linseed oil, peas, beans and          
 grass. These are grown about every    
 third year, and rotation of crops at  
 the farm is; winter-barley, oil-seed  
 rape, and winter wheat twice , then a 
 break crop. A large amount of money is
 spent on artificial fertilizers and   
 chemicals. About Â£16 - 20,000 a year. 
 All of these are in liquid form so    
 cutting expenses. The E.E.C. affects  
 all farms in the area through milk    
 quotas, corn prices and controls      
 mainly the type of farming. Farming in
 the area is changing. The farmers and 
 the public are becoming more aware    
 of the need for conservation.         </content>
