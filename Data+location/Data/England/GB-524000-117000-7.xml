		<title>07THE PRIORY OF OUR LADY</title>
		<content>  The Priory occupies 30 acres west of 
 the A23 at Sayers Common (O.S.265188) 
 There are 2 ponds, 1 natural and 1 man
 made, and a path dating from Druid    
 times. The buildings, planned as a    
 circle, incorporating some 600 year   
 old farm buildings, were erected in   
 1978. They include "Kingslands" a     
 Georgian house the deeds of which date
 from 1580, when Queen Elizabeth 1 made
 a rent of one red rose.               
  There are nuns' quarters, kitchen,   
 laundry, dining rooms, library, guest 
 wing with bedrooms, 2 chapels and an  
 exceptionally beautiful church, shaped
 like a conical oasthouse.             
  The Canonesses of St. Augustine began
 in 14th. century Holland, and spread  
 to Belgium, later English nuns escaped
 there from religious persecution in   
 1609. In 1886 a community returned and
 set up a Priory in Haywards Heath.    </content>
