		<title>02TRANSPORT IN NEWICK</title>
		<content>    Transport in the early part of this
 century, in the Newick area was by    
 rail or by road.On the roads one      
 either walked or rode a bicycle, drove
 a horse-drawn vehicle or one of the   
 recently invented motorcars.          
    Today, the East Grinstead to Lewes 
 railway is no longer in existence. It 
 was closed in 1958. There are two bus 
 services, running hourly, one from    
 Haywards Heath to Uckfield and the    
 other from Newick to Lewes. Most      
 families own a car, making London     
 an hour away and the coast a mere     
 half hour journey. Good motorway      
 systems are also fairly accessible.   
 The River Ouse, once navigable by     
 barges as far as Newick, is now only a
 haunt for anglers. Air travellers need
 only travel about 20 miles to Gatwick 
 Airport, one of London's major        
 airports.                             </content>
