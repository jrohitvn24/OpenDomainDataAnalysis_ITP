		<title>03Life On My Estate</title>
		<content>   The estate is tidy where I live but 
 the other side of the  estate is a    
 mess with old news-papers scattered   
 around.There is one road going down   
 to a block that stops cars from       
 coming through.My street has three car
 parks but not many cars use them.     
   In the next street lives an old man.
 When the boys play football and bang  
 their ball against the fence he comes 
 out and tells them off.They hide round
 the corner.When small children come   
 out they get excited and shout and    
 scream.                               
   Many of the people are elderly and  
 some of them moan at you.One man never
 has a smile on his face.He walks round
 with a grumpy expression and if you   
 are noisy he comes out and nags at    
 you.My neighbour gardens nearly every 
 day pulling out weeds and watering    
 her plants.                           </content>
