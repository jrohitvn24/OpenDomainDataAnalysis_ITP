		<title>18GOXHILL PLAYING FIELD CONT.</title>
		<content> Concern has been caused amongst local 
 people with the start of the BMX Fun -
 Track because it is close to housing; 
 has necessitated resiting children's  
 apparatus; is likely to make grass    
 cutting difficult; will attract older 
 children and put off the younger ones.
 The Playing Fields Association intend 
 to fence off the  playing field's     
 entrance to prevent motorcycles       
 entering as they now do. They say that
 the children's apparatus is being     
 resited to make room for a toddler    
 area but this places that facility    
 alongside an unfenced, waterfilled    
 ditch. On visiting the school the     
 police saw work in progress and were  
 worried as to who would supervise     
 activities on the scheme's completion.
 A family "Fun Afternoon", which is    
 hoped to become an annual event, is   
 planned and may allay people's fears. </content>
