		<content> Eastnor Castle was built in 1812 in   
 the style of a Medieval Castle. It is 
 surrounded by extensive parkland      
 which include an 18 acre lake fed by  
 two streams and well stocked with     
 carp. The overflow from the lake is   
 the Glynch Brook which flows past     
 Clencher's Mill and Pepper Mill. There
 is evidence that at these mills there 
 used to be water wheels.              
 Bromesberrow Place is a large country 
 house constructed of timber and       
 mortar. The large garden has a ha-ha  
 at the end of the extensive lawns.    
 Dingwood Park takes its name from a   
 meeting place in the wood. It was     
 built as a hunting lodge for the      
 Bishops of Hereford and has their     
 crest above the entrance. The house   
 has several unusual features including
 corner fireplaces and decorative      
 ceilings.                             </content>
