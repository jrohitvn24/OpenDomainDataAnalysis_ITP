		<content>   Our family live in an ancient house 
 206 years old called{Wood End         
{House.}When it was built the garage   
 was a farmhouse which was built 114   
 years earlier. The people next door   
 live  in the converted barn which they
 have done up very nicely.             
 The newest part of the house is made  
 up of four cottages. The winduws are  
 all widened mullions with sash        
 frames. We have many rooms that an    
 ordinary house doesn't have such as a 
 washroom,study,cellar and a keeping   
 room which is where we have a         
 refrigerator and our freezers and food
 store.                                
 In our{garden}we have a stone summer  
 house and a stone shed. The garden has
 two levels with some steps coming     
 round. A drain along the west facing  
 side turns and runs under the house.
