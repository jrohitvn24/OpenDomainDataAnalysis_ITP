		<title>08WHY MRS ORR BOUGHT HER HOUSE</title>
		<content> Mrs Orr went to live in{Bamburgh   }  
{Avenue in 1956.}The house was brand   
 new and cost Â£1,450.The mortgage rate 
 was fixed at 5.5% and cost Â£8.50 a    
 month.It is a semi detached with a    
 garden.She moved there because the    
 house was one of the new houses being 
 built in South Shields at that        
 time.The{Leas and beach}are just over 
 the road.It is only a five minute walk
 to the nearby shops and a short bus   
 ride to the town or Sunderland.These  
 were all good reasons for buying a    
 house here.The old N.C.B.railway has  
 gone and more new houses have been    
 built.                                
    Today the houses sell for          
 around{Â£32,000.}She and her family    
 enjoy living there but Mrs Orr would  
 like to see better control of dogs and
 motor bikes.
