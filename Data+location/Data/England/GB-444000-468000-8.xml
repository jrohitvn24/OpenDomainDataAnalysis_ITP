		<content>{Mrs Plowman-Render is a typical       
{resident of Helperby.She lives in Back
{Lane.                                 
{  There are approximately one thousand
{souls living in Helperby but there    
{used to be five hundred about twenty  
{years ago.                            
{  The land has changed a lot because  
{they have built about forty houses on 
{what used to be good farmland across  
{the road from the Plowman-Renders'    
{house.                                
{  She told us that there is a war     
{memorial to the men who fell in the   
{Boer War (built in 1902) and a        
{fountain put up in 1897 to commemorate
{the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria.
{  There are a number of shops that are
{available in the village from an      
{antique shop to the most modern sort  
{of grocery.
