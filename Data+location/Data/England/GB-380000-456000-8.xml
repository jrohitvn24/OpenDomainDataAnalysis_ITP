		<title>08FARMING MILK LONG PRESTON</title>
		<content> In our shippon we have 14 stalls and  
 we milk 2 cows in each.Some of the new
 heifers don't like the milking        
 machines and they kick them off.We    
 feed them cake in buckets and the cows
 can drink from little basins by       
 pressing a lever with their noses.    
  The milk goes to the cooling house   
 where we bottle it twice a day.My Dad 
 fills 10 crates with 20 bottles in    
 each.We put the tinfoil tops on with a
 rubber plunger.Mum and Dad start the  
 milk round at 8.45 a.m.They use the   
 landrover now but Grandad used a horse
 and cart with churns and pint and half
 pint jugs.                            
  We also have 150 sheep which we shear
 a field at a time.We put a mattress   
 down and use electric shears.We keep  
 the ewe lambs for 3 or 4 years but we 
 sell nearly all the tup lambs.
