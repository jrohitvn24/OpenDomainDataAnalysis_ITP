		<content> The narrow chalk ridge known as the   
{Hog's Back}runs east to  west between 
 Guildford and Farnham and the lovely  
 villages of Puttenham and Compton are 
 sheltered on the southern slopes.     
 Wanborough lies on the northern side. 
{The North Downs Way}runs through      
{Puttenham}with its old cottages,      
 farmhouses and converted barns, to    
 pass the church amid the trees.       
 Although still a farming village it is
 the home of artists and sculptors.    
 There are large areas of common and   
 woodland to the south.{Wanborough}is a
 hamlet with a tiny old church, a manor
 house with an interesting history, and
 a magnificent tythe barn built by the 
 monks of Waverley Abbey. The North    
 Downs Way crosses the Golf course on  
 Puttenham Heath and passes the Watts  
 Gallery as it reaches{Compton}with its
 ancient church.                       </content>
