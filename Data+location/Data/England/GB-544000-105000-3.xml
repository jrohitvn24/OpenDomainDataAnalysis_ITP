		<content> My parents each have a job. My father 
 is a blacksmith and he is quite often 
 late home because he has to travel a  
 lot. My mother works with computers.  
 She has to do the housework and she   
 works in the garden. I help by        
 watering the plants and other jobs. My
 mum works nights so we see her more   
 because she sleeps while we are at    
 school.They go to the club or         
 sometimes the Trevor Arms for a meal  
 with friends.                         
           *************               
 At home my mum cooks the dinner on our
 Raburn.It is a cooker with a fire     
 inside. My mum is a cook and my dad is
 a lorry driver. My brother and I      
 sometimes go to work with my dad.     
 During the summer holidays I stay with
 my nan as mum is at work. In the      
 holidays we go swimming and for days  
 out to different places.              </content>
