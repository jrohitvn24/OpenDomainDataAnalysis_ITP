		<title>13Biddestone Broadsheet</title>
		<content>      The Biddestone Broadsheet is a   
 free illustrated monthly newsletter   
 which is delivered monthly to every   
 house in the parish of Biddestone &amp;   
 Slaughterford.                        
      It is supported by voluntary     
 contributions from readers, the parish
 council and the village fete          
 committee.                            
      The aim is to give everyone a    
 sense of involvement in a community   
 which perhaps is more fragmented than 
 it was a generation ago, when people  
 were more interdependent.             
      The Broadsheet is edited by a    
 commmittee of seven.News is given of  
 "what's on", births, marriages, deaths
 and moves in and out of the village.  
 The parish council,school, W.I. etc.  
 report on their activities and there  
 are regular nature notes.
