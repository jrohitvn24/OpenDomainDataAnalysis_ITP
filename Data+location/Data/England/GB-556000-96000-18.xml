    The number of private schools      
 diminished in the years after the     
 Second World War. This is because     
 during the war many schools were      
 evacuated to avoid bombing. After     
 1945, as so many schools did not      
 return, buildings and space was either
 used for residential housing or left  
 to be developed later. These schools  
 are now all charitable trusts, whereas
 originally they were run for profit.  
 The population of Meads has now become
 much older and full of retired people.
 Conseqently, the number of schools has
 been reduced. There is also one       
 primary school and a college of       
 technology in the area.
