		<title>04STONEWALLING IN DUFTON</title>
		<content> Says the youthful twice winner of     
 Dufton Show walling competition,"I    
 have been building walls since the age
 of 10.On the family farm most walling 
 is repairing gaps which appear due to 
 old age,shifting foundations or heavy 
 snow.Two types of stone are used_sand-
 stone from a local quarry &amp; limestone 
 from the fells.A good foundation,     
 2\feet wide,is dug out &amp; 2 level rows 
 of large stones form the base,infilled
 with tightly packed small stones.The  
 walling stones cross the joints of the
 row below &amp; at 2'&amp; 4' through bands   
 (long stones)are used.The wall is     
 tapered towards the top &amp; is levelled 
 at 5',then covered by a single row of 
 large coping stones.Walls are valued  
 for the shelter they provide,         
 especially for the sheep,but few new  
 ones are built today as it is a labour
 intensive job &amp; therefore expensive.  </content>
