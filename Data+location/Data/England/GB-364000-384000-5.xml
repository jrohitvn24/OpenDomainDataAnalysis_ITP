		<title>05BRADLEY DAIRY FARM ROUTINE</title>
		<content> The dairy cows graze out in the fields
 from mid-April to mid-October.  The   
 cows graze a strip of land at a time, 
 they are kept in place by an electric 
 fence.  After a month they are moved  
 into another field.                   
 In the winter the cows are kept in    
 sheds and are fed on silage and       
 protein enriched cattle cake.  They   
 eat about 4Okg per day.  The amount of
 cattle feed they have is increased    
 when they give more milk after the    
 calves are born.                      
 Milking is carried out twice a day.   
 From 7am until 9am and then 4.3Opm to 
 6.15pm.  They are fed on corn whilst  
 in the milking parlour.  They are     
 clever and bang the container with    
 their heads to get more corn whilst   
 they are milked by the automatic      
 machines.  All the milk is sold to the
 Milk Marketing Board.                 </content>
