 Monday. April 8th. 1985.              
                                       
 7.30am. I woke up and went into my    
 parents' room and woke mum up.        
 7.33am. Mummy and I went downstairs   
 and fed Daisy, our cat, then we laid  
 the table.                            
 8.00am. We all sat down for breakfast.
 We all had Weetabix and toast.        
 8.30am. Mummy and Aunty Sue (Mum's    
 sister) went to town and I stayed with
 Daddy and Rebecca.                    
 8.45am. I got washed and dressed.     
 9.00am. I watched the 'Wide Awake     
 Club' on the T.V. It was very good    
 even though I didn't see all of it.   
 10.00am. We went out with Daddy       
 because someone had a leak in their   
 house and Daddy, who is a plumber, had
 to go and fix it.                     
                                       </content>
