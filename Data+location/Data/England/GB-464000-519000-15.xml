		<title>15WEEKEND HOMELIFE IN SALTBURN</title>
		<content>   On a Sunday morning I rise at 8.00am
 get washed, dressed, have breakfast of
 egg and tomato on toast, then gather  
 my pony's gear. Mum, Dad and I drive  
 to the stables to ride. I ride my     
 pony, Shamrock. We ride on the beach  
 with the riding school. Later, while  
 Mum is making lunch, Dad takes me to  
 Middlesbrough to pick up Grandad, who 
 comes to lunch every Sunday. When it  
 is ready, we all sit down and eat.    
 After lunch I read for a while, then  
 go to see our neighbour, Aunty Joan. I
 help her in the garden because Uncle  
 Rab has gone to work in Manchester.   
 Later I go back and say goodbye to    
 Grandad at about 5.00pm. I talk to Mum
 while she makes tea. When Dad returns,
 we have tea and settle down to watch  
 television. I go to bed at 8.30pm. (My
 name is Sophie Moore.)
