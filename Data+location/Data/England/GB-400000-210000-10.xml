		<content>The area is almost entirely based on   
farming &amp;the population is scattered.  
The population looks to various centres
for their services.The most frequent   
goods are foods which must be bought   
locally,eg Cirencester.Some farmers    
used Cheltenham because the area is    
half way between the two on the A435.  
 The Post Ofice and doctor need to be  
close ie Chedworth,Rendcomb &amp; N Cerney 
in village centres.Less important &amp;    
less frequently needed are clothes &amp;   
furniture.This can almost be a day trip
to Cheltenham.This is a favourite      
choice giving a wider variety of       
products than Cirencester or local     
villages.London was also supported for 
items such as TVs,cars,fridges etc. The
service areas for trade in farming     
products can be more widely spread to  
include the Midlands,the London area or
the      of the UK.                    </content>
