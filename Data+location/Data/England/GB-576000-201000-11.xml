<title>11EAST HANNINGFIELD</title>
<content>

East Hanningfield is a village, surrounded by flat farmland, adjoining Bicknacre on its north-east boundary  and approximately 4 miles to the east boundary of Chelmsford. The population of 1000 has increased by two-thirds during the last 4 years. Four new estates have been built in discreet positions so as to preserve the old-world look of the village. The 100-year old church replaces the Saxon one that was destroyed by fire and stands on the main road at the  north entrance to the village.    The Southend-Chelmsford bus runs through the village hourly, offering regular transport for workers at the small industries.  There is a public house, restaurant and a modern Church of England school.   &lt;br />
