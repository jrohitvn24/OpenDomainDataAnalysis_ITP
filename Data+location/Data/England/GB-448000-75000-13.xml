		<title>13Occupations - Niton Area</title>
		<content> Farming,the tourist trade,local trade 
 and some market gardening provide most
 of the employment in the area.Very    
 little fishing is done compared with  
 the past,and the crabs,for which Niton
 was once famous,are the most          
 provitabe catches.                    
 In a survey of 53 families carried out
 in June 1985 by Class 4 at Niton C.P  
 School there were 6 fathers working in
 Niton,38 in other parts of the Island 
 (10 being mobile),4 worked on the     
 mainland,2 abroad and 2 at sea.There  
 were 2 unemployed.Half the mothers had
 jobs.The unemployment on the Island   
 is higher than the rest of the South- 
 East England,but lower than the       
 national average.It fluctuates        
 considerably from 13.9% in the summer 
 to 17% in the winter due to the       
 seasonal work of the Tourist Industry.
