		<title>17Mrs Hazeldine of Ranton</title>
		<content>                                       
Mrs Hazeldine was born in Wolverhampton
and used to be a police sergeant.  When
she was in the police force she met her
husband  and left to get married.  Soon
afterwards  they  bought the  Hand  and
Cleaver  Inn. They also kept  pigs  and
cattle  and bred cockerels.  They  sold
the  pigs and cockerels and  just  kept
the  cows to keep the grass down.  They
sold the inn after twenty-one years and
were glad to retire.                   
The  Hazeldines kept some of the  inn's
land  as it joined on to the farm  they
had bought. Unfortunately no farming is
done  but the thirty acres  are  rented
out  for summer grazing. It  is  rented
out  from May to October  for  Friesian
cattle.
