		<title>14Limestone and Drystone Walls</title>
		<content>{Limestone}is composed of egg-like     
 granules of crystalline calcite.      
{Cotswold stone}is only found in this  
 area and is quarried. If the rock is  
 not quarried at the right time it may 
 flake or crumble from frost. The      
 houses are very distinguished in this 
 area because they are made of this    
 stone.{St. Lawrence's Church}was built
 in 1784 and over the years the stone  
 has survived, although masonry work   
 was done in 1977-78. Limestone        
{crumbles}and{deteriorates}through age,
 rain and air-pollution. Pigeon House, 
 Sherborne Terrace, was built in the   
 14th century and has also survived.   
{Drystone walls}are used on farms to   
 divide up fields and are still in use 
 on{Moore Lane Farm.}These days people 
 like to use the walls in gardens and  
 landscapes because they are so        
 picturesque.                          </content>
