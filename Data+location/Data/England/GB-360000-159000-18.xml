		<title>18CHANGES TO CLUTTON SCHOOL</title>
		<content>   There have been two main changes to 
 the schoolthis year.                  
        {The new building}             
  On Thursday 12th June a new building 
 was delivered.It came in three large  
 sections which were delivered on the  
 back of a lorry and the road had to be
 closed. A land rover used a pulley and
 a set of wheels to manoeuvre the      
 sections through the gates and behind 
 the school. It was then put together. 
 This took two days. We now have a new 
 Headteacher's office, a staffroom and 
 a store room.{                        
{     The conservation area }          
 Part of the school grounds  has been  
 turned into a conservation area. We   
 have put in a deep pond and a frog has
 already come to live there.We have    
 some large tadpoles.White orchids,    
 camomile and tall thistles are growing
 and butterflies have come.            </content>
