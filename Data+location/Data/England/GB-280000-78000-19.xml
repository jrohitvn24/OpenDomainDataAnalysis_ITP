		<content> There are lots of insects that sting  
 fly, crawl and other things as well.  
 In the world there are lots of        
 shops,houses,people,cars,trees,fields,
 birds and fish.Workmen are building   
 new houses so people can live in them 
 and  other things are happening in the
 world.Most people have got jobs but   
 some haven't because unemployment is  
 quite high. Most people can have food 
 but in Ethiopia there is a famine and 
 water is short. England is a free     
 country and we can do most things we  
 like.If people are bad or do something
 which is against the rule then they   
 are fined or put in prison.
