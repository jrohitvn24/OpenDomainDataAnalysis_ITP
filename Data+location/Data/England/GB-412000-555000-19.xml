		<title>19HAMSTERLEY MILL ESTATE</title>
		<content>   My name is Jonathan and I live at   
 Hamsterley Mill which is a hamlet     
 built on land previously owned by Lord
 Gort. It is about two miles from      
 Rowlands Gill in the Derwent Valley.  
 The land was sold in large plots to   
 people who had houses built           
 individually. No two houses had to be 
 the same. The roads in the estate are 
 all private and are very rural        
 looking, having broad verges and a lot
 of trees. It is a very quiet, peaceful
 place to live. At the top of our      
 garden is the Derwent Walk which was  
 the old railway line from Swalwell to 
 Consett. This has been turned into a  
 lovely walk with picnic places. Some  
 of the old railway buildings can still
 be seen - there is a station platform 
 at Lintzford. Nearer to us are two    
 large viaducts which are very         
 impressive.                           </content>
