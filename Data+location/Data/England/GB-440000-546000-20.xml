		<title>20SOCIAL PROBLEMS IN SEAHAM</title>
		<content> ONE OF THE MAIN PROBLEMS IN SEAHAM IS 
 VANDALISM.ALL TOO OFTEN PUBLIC        
 TELEPHONES DO NOT WORK BECAUSE OF     
 VANDALS.SOME YOUTHS DAUB WALLS WITH   
 PAINT OR WRITE ON THEM.PUBLIC PLACES  
 LIKE SCHOOLS ARE A PARTICULAR         
 TARGET.WINDOWS ARE OFTEN BROKEN OR    
 ROOFS ARE DAMAGED BY CHILDREN PLAYING 
 ON THEM.THE COUNCIL STOPPED ERECTING  
 AN ANNUAL CHRISTMAS TREE BECAUSE THE  
 LIGHTS AND TOYS WERE ALWAYS SMASHED.  
 AT DENESIDE SCHOOL WE PLANTED 100 NEW 
 TREES BUT THEY WERE ALL PULLED UP.WE  
 ALL HOPE THAT THE SITUATION WILL      
 IMPROVE.
