		<content> Wholly agricultural, with exception of
 Farmington quarry (04130217) which    
 produces Cotswold (Oolitic) Limestone 
 building stone in blocks and also     
 finished window mouldings etc. Crops  
 are mostly wheat and barley and       
 managed grassland but there are       
 several substantial patches of        
 (mainly) deciduous woodland. Lots of  
 pheasants and hares and a few fallow  
 deer roam about. High enough (140m    
 to200m) to be cold and windy in winter
 Cotswold drystone walls divide the    
 fields but many are falling down and  
 are replaced with wire. Sheep and     
 cattle to be seen on grassland in     
 summer, indoors in winter mostly.
