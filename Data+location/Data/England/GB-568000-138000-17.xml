		<content>The Gun &amp; Spitroast Inn is an old      
Coaching inn, built in 1480.  It has a 
garden where customers play a game     
called Boule which is a bit like Bowls.
The owner, Patrick Harrison, has been  
there for three years.  They cook beef 
&amp; pork on a spit over an apple-wood    
fire.  A meal costs about 950p &amp; they  
serve some 20 meals on an average      
evening.                               
The King's Arms was burnt down by the  
King's men in 1800.  The next King,    
George IV, had it rebuilt on the same  
spot &amp; it reopened in 1832.  They have 
an Off-licence at one side of the      
building &amp; a garden by the road.  They 
sell hot &amp; cold food from noon to 3pm. 
The Town House, which is beside the    
King's Arms, was built in 1856.  It is 
popular with the younger adults in the 
village.
