		<title>09Tourism in Bridport</title>
		<content>       Bridport has long enjoyed       
 popularity as a holiday centre with   
 various types of accomodation.        
      Throughout the summer cars       
 towing caravans crowd the roads       
 approaching the West Bay International
 Holiday Centre built in 1984 at a cost
 of Â£250,000. This one_time municipal  
 camping ground now holds 280 static   
 caravans and has room for 350 touring 
 vehicles. The centre features an      
 Entertainment Hall, children's fun    
 room, two large bars, a laundry,      
 supermarket and many showers units    
 with toilet and washing facilities.   
      Although attempts have been made 
 to over_commercialise West Bay, the   
 resort has managed to retain its      
 character as a small, quiet fishing   
 port.
