		<title>13Attitudes</title>
		<content>  We went out in our area to find out  
 how peoples attitudes varied over     
 different items.First we chose        
 computers.Most of the children found  
 them interesting and fun to play games
 on ,they also told us how they were   
 being introduced into their school    
 work.However,the adults looked at them
 from a different angle.They could see 
 that they were changing peoples way of
 life rapidly and that this could      
 produce loss of employment,as people  
 were being replaced by computers.An   
 example of this was discovered when we
 contacted six local firms to find that
 they used computers for wages,stock   
 control, and details of staff and     
 customers.                            
  Our next topic was nuclear power.It  
 was felt that the majority of people  
 thought it to be a good idea if it was
 to be used in the right circumstances.</content>
