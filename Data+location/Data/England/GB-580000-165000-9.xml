		<content>Hop Farming ia apparent in the fields  
east of Rainham.Many workers are local 
housewives who travel in from the      
surrounding towns,in particular        
Rainham.They have to be at work by 8.50
a.m.The first work of the year is in   
{January} and involves cutting back    
dead vines.Breakfast is 10 minutes in  
weather that is often cold.Work        
finishes at 3 p.m.This task takes about
6 weeks. Later in the year the poles   
and stringing hooks have to be examined
and repaired.After {Easter} the        
training of th hops with 6 to 8 string 
lines begins.Each vine goes            
anti-clockwise, following the sun.In   
{September} the vines are cut.The      
flowers are sent to drying sheds called
{Oasts}.Farmers know how much to grow  
because orders can be place up to 5    
years in advance.
