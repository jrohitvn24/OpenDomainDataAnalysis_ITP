 The Albi exchange started like        
 this. Our Vicar went to a meeting with
 Father Icher,a French Priest who asked
 if anyone wanted to do an exchange.The
 Vicar said that,we would like to do   
 it.The Albi exchange started 12years  
 ago.Albi is in the South of           
 France,60km from Toulouse.This year is
 the 12th exchange.Every year about 45 
 children go,aged between 13 and 20.One
 child to each family.When the children
 go to Albi,they visit places.They     
 visit villages,they do concerts,look  
 round Albi cathedral,and lots of      
 things like that.When the French      
 children come to Prestbury they do    
 similar things.They visit Alton       
 Towers,York and Chester,and they do a 
 concert.                              </content>
