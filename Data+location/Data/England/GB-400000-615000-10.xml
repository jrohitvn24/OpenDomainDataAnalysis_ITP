		<title>10INGRAM FARM</title>
		<content> The farm at Ingram is run by three    
 brothers .The farm extends from river 
 pasture to moorland.Along the river   
 there are arable crops grown such as  
 barley.Hay is also grown along this   
 fertile stretch and is fed to the     
 animals during the winter .On the high
 ground,sheep are farmed.These are     
 looked after by a shepherd who lives  
 in the hamlet of Ingram.Until last    
 year,the farm buildings were mostly   
 old-fashioned stone-built ones but now
 new sheds have been built along with  
 new silage pits.
