		<content> Apart from Youngsbury,there are       
 several other estates in this area.   
{"SUTES"}lies to the north of High     
 Cross village. It used to be called   
 "Soos" and the first record of it,was 
 in 1412. The present house is a C17th 
 timber-frame house,now covered with   
 plaster. 2 original chimney stacks and
 the kitchen fireplace remain. It used 
 to be a moated manor house.           
{"SAWTREES"}manor was first owned by   
 Sir Nicholas Thorley(knight) in C15th.
{"GREAT BARWICK"}manor was first owned 
 by Eustace Fitz-Thomas in C13th. It   
 was leased  by the king to Sir Ralph  
 Sadleir,in 1543.                      
{"FABDENS"}is a good example of a      
 "Wealden" house ie. it has one ridge  
 running the whole length of the house.
{"MARSHALLS"}manor at High Cross is an 
 old site,but the original house was   
 replaced by a new building in 1906.   </content>
