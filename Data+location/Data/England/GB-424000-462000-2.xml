		<content> A day in the life of Josephine Lloyd  
 There are three children in our family
 I'm 7 and the boys are 6 and 4. We    
 live in a converted farmhouse. I wake 
 at 7.45 am and have breakfast of      
 cereal and orange juice. After washing
 and dressing I practice the piano     
 while I wait for the boys. At school  
 we play our brass instruments and     
 recorders, then do Mathematics for an 
 hour. After play we do creative       
 writing and topic work. We take our   
 words home to learn every Thursday    
 night and have a spelling test on     
 Friday. Some children bring a packed  
 lunch but school dinners cost 67 pence
 My mother is a nurse and my dad is a  
 retired teacher. He calls himself     
 Charlie Muggins because he has to do  
 all the jobs. After school my brother 
 goes for swiming lessons I can swim. I
 go to bed at 8.30pm and read for a bit</content>
