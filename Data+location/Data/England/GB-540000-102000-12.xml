		<content>  Telscombe Manor a beautiful old stone
and flint building close to the main   
lane started out as a farm cottage,    
but over the centuries it has been     
added to until it reached its present  
size.                                  
  A tower was added in the middle of   
the twentieth century keeping the flint
faced style.                           
  A large number of the fitments came  
from an old house in the west country  
(when it was demolished). These have   
been well introduced to the style of   
the house.                             
  Many of the doors are disguised as   
highly polished fitted items of        
furniture, one magnificent 'glass      
cabinet' actually being the door to the
now disused smugglers tunnel (which    
once led to the church).               
  The grounds are ornate and include a 
seventeenth century sun-dial.          </content>
