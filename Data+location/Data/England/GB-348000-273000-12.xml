		<title>12LUDLOW BYPASS</title>
		<content> The Ludlow By-pass was officially     
 opened in 1981 after much local       
 controversy over the route it should  
 take.                                 
   It runs for a distance of 4.5miles  
 around the eastern edge of town       
 leaving the Bromfield road just north 
 of Ludlow and finishing at Ashford    
 X-roads.                              
  An estimated 500vehicles per hour use
 the by-pass,relieving the narrow      
 streets of the town of heavy traffic. 
 Many of Ludlow's historic buildings   
 have been saved from further damage.  
  Recently, however,in August 1985     
 major sections of the by-pass have had
 to be wholly dug up and relaid.This   
 has meant many delays and a return of 
 heavy traffic to the streets of       
 Ludlow.
