		<title>14Tutbury, general information</title>
		<content>In Tutbury the shops are a combination 
of the old and the new.Some old        
businesses have died out and others    
have taken their place like a video    
shop, a fish and chip shop and a       
Chinese take-away.Yet there are still  
places like the Cobblers shop which are
old.                                   
At one time there were seventeen pubs  
in the village and less people but now 
there are more people and less pubs.   
No-one very famous has grown up in     
Tutbury although several good          
cricketers were born there.            
Many years ago there was a Tutbury     
prize Silver Band.Now there is a       
Tutbury Band which plays at local      
Fayres.The bands are very diffefent    
but were and are good to listen to     
Tutbury probably needs a sports centre 
more than anything else.
