		<content>     Wimbledon is best known for       
 tennis.Players from all over the world
 come to the All England Tennis        
 Club.During the Winter they would get 
 wet from the rain,so now we have got  
 the Wimbledon Indoor Tennis Club which
 was built in 1984 and which we can see
 from our school.                      
     Merton is also known for its      
 connection with Nelson.Many pubs are  
 named after him,and there are lots of 
 pictures and monuments of him and of  
 Lady Emma Hamilton.St.Mary's Church in
 Merton is very old.Nelson and Lady    
 Hamilton used to visit this church.The
 churchyard also contains the tombs of 
 John Innes and William Rutlish.
