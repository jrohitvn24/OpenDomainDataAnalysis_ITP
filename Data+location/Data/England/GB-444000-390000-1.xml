 The area is mostly residential.There  
 are some playing fields and there are 
 some open spaces.People who live in   
 the area usually go to work in        
 Rotherham or Sheffield.One main road  
 slices the area in half.It is a dual  
 carriageway.It starts at the M18      
 motorway at Hellaby and goes right    
 through Wickersley to the Rotherway   
 near Brinsworth.It is called Bawtry   
 Road.Most of the houses are privately 
 owned but there is a large council    
 estate at Herringthorpe.We have a     
 leisure centre it has a swimming      
 pool,squash courts and a roller       
 skating rink.It is 33p for one junior 
 swimmer.There is a private golf course
 called Sitwell Park.We have regular   
 bus services to Rotherham Doncaster   
 and Sheffield.Children can travel to  
 Sheffield for 4p and Rotherham for 2p.</content>
