		<content> The area around{Wickford}and Ramsden  
 Bellhouse has been occupied since     
 about 2000 B.C..When the{romans}      
 arrived in the first century A.D. they
 encountered a tribe called the        
{Trinovantes.}The main area of the     
 settlement was near the present day   
 site of St.Catherine's Church.The     
 first document mentioning{'Wicforda'} 
 is dated 975 A.D..{'Wicfort'}is named 
 in the Domesday book.The main         
 landowners were{Sweyne}and{Bishop     
{Odo.}The population probably remained 
 under 250 until the early             
 1800's.Little seems to                
 have changed here until about 100     
 years ago.In 1889 the railway to      
 Shenfield and London was built.Local  
 farmland was then sold off for        
 development in plots.Amenities were   
 connected later.Most development has  
 occurred since 1945.                  </content>
