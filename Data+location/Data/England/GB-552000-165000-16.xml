		<content>Many of us live in {EYNSFORD} - many   
people believe Aegen was a Saxon       
chief. The village which grew up       
around the local ford is named         
Aegansford - {EYNSFORD}.               
{FARNINGHAM}- Ham shows that Anglo     
Saxons settled there. "Ham" was the    
Saxon word for "home" - "ING" means    
son of. {DARENT} - It was              
called Deruentio by  the ancient       
Britons, it means"oak river" because   
its valley was covered by oak trees.   
{SPAREPENNY LANE} - carters used this  
lane to avoid paying tolls on the main 
road.                                  
{BEESFIELD LANE}, leading to Beesfield 
farm, is named after the cows (beasts) 
which graze in fields, not after bees  
as one might think. It used to be known
as beast field lane.
