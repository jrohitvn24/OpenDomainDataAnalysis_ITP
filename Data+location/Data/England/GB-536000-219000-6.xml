		<content>  Houses range from very old detached  
 manor houses like the Lordship (where 
 Dick Turpin is said to have stayed )  
 to a much smaller new council-owned   
 terrace at Colliers End.Large isolated
 farmhouses,some dating back several   
 hundred years,contrast with new       
 bungalows.Latchford is a nucleated    
 village located at a ford of the      
 River.It is a mixture of old and new  
 housing styles,well maintained and    
 attractive in appearance.Barwick is   
 also located at a ford ; it is a      
 sprawling settlement and has a        
 permanent residential caravan site.   
  Up until 1950,there was a large      
 American Army Base located at Colliers
 End.
