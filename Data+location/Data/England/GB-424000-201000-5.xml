area. Most of the customers come from  
outside the area. They are picturesque 
country pubs one of which dates back   
to the fourteenth century.             
  One of the pubs in Langford is called
The Crown. It is run by a landlady who 
does not employ anyone else.(Except on 
a part-time basis).It is open everyday 
during the normal licensing hours. The 
landlady works sixteen and a half      
hours a day.They serve meals and have a
diningroom. The most popular dishes are
lasagne, spaghetti, and curry and rice.
There are between forty and one hundred
and forty customers each day.In the    
first six months of 1985 they sold     
sixty barrels of beer and two hundred  
and forty bottles of wines and spirits.
