		<title>07Williots Manor</title>
		<content> Williots Manor is probably the oldest 
 house in Potters Bar. It is about 200 
 years old. It faces the beefeater.(The
 Beefeater is just past the railway    
 bridge). The house was quite big and  
 has now turned into a pub.The house   
 has leaded windows. Most of it is     
 original. The roof has slates instead 
 of tiles you could  probably have     
 climbed the chimney. A lord would have
 a wife and some children he would also
 have lots of servants to do every     
 thing for him. The lord owned all the 
 land round the Manor. Glass was not   
 very common so only the lords and rich
 people would have glass. It was hard  
 to make in large sheets so small      
 sheets where made and held together   
 with lead.
