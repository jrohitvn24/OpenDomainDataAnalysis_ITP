		<title>06Surprise at Panshangar.</title>
		<content> We were at school looking at a map of 
 Panshangar.The map was mostly trees   
 and fields and on the other side of   
 the road was a school. There was also 
 a small airfield.We went there and saw
 lots of houses. There were small woods
 and a airfield behind the houses but  
 we saw the school so it must be the   
 right place .We were really confused  
 because we expected trees and fields. 
 It was a surprise we trusted the map  
 to be right but the map was wrong,so  
 you can,t trust a map all the time.The
 last time it was changed was in 1981  
 so the houses were built in the last 4
 years so when the next update comes   
 they will have alot of work to do.The 
 builders had not finished making the  
 houses because they were still making 
 the houses because they were still    
 working on the houses.The builders    
 yards were still there.               </content>
