         We wanted to find out about   
cars .We wanted to know how many people
had cars and what they used them for.  
Also we did a survey on how much       
traffic travelled along a main road, a 
secondary road and a minor road near   
our school.We asked 307 children about 
car ownership and use.                 
         We found that 25% of families 
used the car for work,39% for taking   
children to school,48% for shopping,   
41% for everyday use,15% for holidays  
2% for other uses. 38% had more than   
one vehicle.                           
         The next thing we did was the 
traffic survey.We found that in fifteen
minutes we saw 12 vehicles on a minor  
road,89 on a secondary road,201 on a   
main road.Out of all the vehicles a    
third were British,two thirds were     
foreign.                               </content>
