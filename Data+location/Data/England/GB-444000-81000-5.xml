		<content> The 4 manor houses are of Island stone
 with either sandstone tiles or else   
 mainly clay tiles. Sandstone is often 
 only used for the lower rows. The     
 older cottages include traditional    
 rural stone and thatch, the early 20th
 century houses are mainly brick and   
 slate with asbestos tiles where the   
 slate has been replaced, and modern   
 bungalows and council houses are of   
 reconstituted 'island stone'. There   
 are no wooden residences. The farm    
 houses were originally of Ventnor     
 stone with thatched roofs later       
 replaced with clay tiles or even      
 sheets of corrugated iron on smaller, 
 poorer farms.
