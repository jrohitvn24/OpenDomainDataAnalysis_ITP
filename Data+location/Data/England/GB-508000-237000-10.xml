		<title>10NEW BY-PASS FOR CLOPHILL</title>
		<content>  In October{1983}a new road was opened
 which by-passed{Clophill High Street}&amp;
 took all the heavy traffic to{Ampthill
 &amp;{Shefford.}We had been taking a      
 census of traffic travelling through  
{Clophill}when there was an accident   
 which closed the{by-pass}for half a   
 day. This enabled us to make a        
 comparative study of the{traffic flow 
 along the High Street.                
                                       
 The average number of{cars &amp; lorries  
 per hour on a{normal day}was{108      
                                       
 The average number of{cars &amp; lorries  
 per hour{during the accident}was{235  
                                       
 The amount of other traffic such as   
{bicycles &amp; tractors}was seemingly     
 unaffected as it  remained at an      
 average of{29}per hour.
