		<content>   The A1 trunk road used to pass      
 through the centre of the village but 
 in {1983}a bypass was opened and now  
 in {1985}the village is a quiet       
 peaceful place.Lots of cars,buses,    
 lorries and vans used to pass through 
 Scremerston and it was very noisy. You
 can still hear the noise of traffic on
 the bypass but now it is very easy to 
 cross the road and the people at each 
 side of the village can meet and stand
 and talk without being deafened by the
 traffic.                              
   The nearest railway station is in   
{Berwick}and the{United Bus Company}run
 the{505 Service}through the village so
 it is easy to travel to{Newcastle}or  
{Edinburgh}by bus or train.There is    
 also a bus service to{Wooler}and one  
 to{Seahouses.
