		<title>07The School Nurse</title>
		<content> The school nurse's day begins at 8-30 
 at Hendon Health Centre.The morning is
 spent making appointments for         
 children's school medicals and testing
 children's hearing.Afternoon is taken 
 up with school visits - testing       
 eyes,hearing ang general hygiene.Three
 nurseries and three primary schools   
 are visited throughout the year and   
 every child needs to be seen at least 
 once a term.School nurses have cars   
 because they carry hearing machines   
 and other heavy equipment.Social      
 problems make home visiting necessary 
 and some children have to be watched  
 in case of non-accidental             
 injury.Meetings with Doctor,Senior    
 Nursing Officer and other school      
 nurses are a way of keeping up with   
 what is going on.Before going home at 
 4-30,plans for the following day are  
 made.                                 </content>
