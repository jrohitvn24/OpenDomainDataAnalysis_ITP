		<content>  Adisham district seems a healthy     
place in which to live, several people 
over eighty are remarkably active and  
fit. Villagers chose a doctor from one 
of the surrounding villages, who visit 
if they are unable to attend surgery.  
The doctor's arrange for visits by the 
District Nurse or Midwife, if required,
as these Nurses cover a wide area.     
People have to go to Canterbury for any
hospital treatment or dentistry.  The  
Area Health Authority hold a Child Wel-
fare Clinic once a month in the village
with a Doctor, Health Visitor and      
Nurse, for children under five.  Some  
elderly residents are taken by         
ambulance, to a Day Centre in Canter-  
bury, once or twice a week. Concern was
expressed because there was no doctor  
resident in the village. Veterinary    
care for animals also has to come from 
outside the area.                      </content>
