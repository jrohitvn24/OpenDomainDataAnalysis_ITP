 The crops that are grown are winter   
 and spring wheat and winter and spring
 barley.Some of the farm land is       
 managed grassland from which silage   
 and hay are also cut.Some of the less 
 fertile hillier parts are used for    
 rearing sheep.The most common breeds  
 are mules and Suffolks.               
   Manor farm is a mixed farm.It has a 
 dairy herd of about 150 Friesian cows 
 and one bull is kept.There is a flock 
 of 700 sheep.Five men work on the farm
 including the dairy man.              
   Pheasants are reared at several     
 places in the area.The chicks are sold
 in late summer to restock the woods on
 large farms and estates.
