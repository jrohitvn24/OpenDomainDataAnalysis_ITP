		<content> Bulls Lodge Dairy Farm is part of a   
 group, that covers much of the        
 area.There are 500 cattle Fresian X   
 Holstein. The land consists mostly of 
 leys,but some wheat is grown for a    
 change.                               
 There is a large enclosed area,with   
 pens and a circular milking           
 parlour.When the complex was built in 
 1975 it was the largest of its kind in
 Europe.                               
 The cows are brought in for part of   
 the day as soon as they have          
 calved,and for the full day in August,
 because by then the grass is  less    
 nourishing.They are then fed on       
 unlimited silage, and cattle cake.    
 They also like to drink the residue   
 from the silage, which contains       
 nutrients. The average useful lifetime
 for a cow is 7 years.The cows have    
 identification tags.                  </content>
