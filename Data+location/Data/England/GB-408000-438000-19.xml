		<title>19A Typical Day</title>
		<content> I am usually awakened by the alarm    
 clock at about 7am. After getting     
 dressed I wake my three children and  
 give them their breakfast of toast,   
 cereal and a cup of tea. I see them   
 off to school at about 8.20am.        
 After washing up and making the beds I
 go in to Bingley to shop. On Tuesday I
 call at the Post Office for my Child  
 Benefit Allowance  of Â£20.55.         
 On my return home I do the washing in 
 the washing machine before having     
 lunch, usually a cup of coffee and a  
 sandwich. I then vacuum and dust in   
 the sitting room and kitchen before   
 getting ready to visit my mother in   
 her flat nearby. I return by 4pm to   
 give the children tea and my husband  
 his dinner. After the meal I garden,  
 read or perhaps attend a Sunday School
 meeting.                              
                                       </content>
