		<title>14Farming in Stithians Facts</title>
		<content> Farming in Stithians is not           
 particularly hard because the  climate
 is usually mild. It is mainly dairy   
 farming but there are some beef       
 cattle. The size of farms vary from 20
 acres to 220 acres. Some farms keep   
 bulls and  some  use artificial       
 insemination. Some farm machinery is  
 hired but most farms own at least one 
 diesel tractor. Farms are mostly      
 worked by the family members with a   
 little paid help. Temporary workers   
 are brought in to help store the      
 silage. There is some cultivation of  
 spring barley and corn which is stored
 and fed to the cattle in the winter.  
 There are about 11 farms in Stithians.
 The price of milk is about 11.5p per  
 litre. The farmers we spoke to all    
 thought it was the only way to earn a 
 living and wanted their children to   
 follow this career.                   </content>
