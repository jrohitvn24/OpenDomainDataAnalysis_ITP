		<title>16Beckingham(Lincs)_Properties</title>
		<content>  The  main  body  of  the  village  of
 Beckingham  comprises  some   eighteen
 properties   arranged   roughly  in  a
 square, bounded  by  Sleaford Road  to
 the South and West, School Lane to the
 East and Chapel Street to the North.  
  Two key properties in the village are
 situated    opposite    the    garage,
 occupying  the two corner sites at the
 junction  of School Lane and  Sleaford
 Road, one being the  Pack Horse public
 house and the other being School House
 which was originally built in 1840 and
 was used  as  a  school  until  recent
 years when it was converted to a      
 private  house  but  still retains its
 original character.                   
  There are 66 properties in all in the
 main body of the  village, these being
 a mixture of the old  and  the new but
 nevertheless   still   retaining   the
 atmosphere of a small rural village.  </content>
