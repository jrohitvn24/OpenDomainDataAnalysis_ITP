 first settled in by the Saxons.       
 Alvechurch was established by King    
 Offa, King of the Mercians, in 780    
 A.D. In 850 A.D Alhun, Bishop of      
 Worcester gave most of the land to    
 King Berhtwulf, and eventually in 934 
 A.D. it was tranferred to the lands of
 the Church of St. Mary, Worcester.    
 Alvechurch was mentioned in the       
 Domesday Book and was 13 hides,had a  
 demesne, 2 ploughs, 1 priest, a reeve,
 a riding man, 12 villeins, and 7      
 bordars. In the Middle Ages, the seat 
 of the Augustinian Bishop of Worcester
 was in Alvechurch in the form of the  
 Bishops Palace. Legend says that the  
 village witnessed savage fighting in  
 1265. In the 14th. century the area   
 was visited by plague, and many were  
 killed including the bishop in his    
 palace.                               </content>
