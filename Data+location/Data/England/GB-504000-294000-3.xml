		<title>03INFORMATION IN NASSINGTON.</title>
		<content>The Church booklet called{The News of  
Nassington and Yarwell}was started by  
the vicar in December 1978.It is given 
to every home in the villages.A lady   
types it free of charge and the vicar  
prints it using an offset litho        
machine.It has between 16 and 36 pages 
and costs 600 pounds annually.The book-
let is used by about 25 local groups.  
In our school there are 54 people and  
52 of them have home telephones.       
Nassington has 2 public telephones,at  
Parkway and The Drove.There are 2      
letter boxes,one at the Post Office and
one on the Church wall which are       
emptied at 8.15am and 4.30pm by a post-
man from Peterborough Sorting Office   
who drives a red van. He also delivers 
letters to homes in Nassington.School  
letters are sent home with pupils to   
inform parents and friends about events
and give information about School.     </content>
