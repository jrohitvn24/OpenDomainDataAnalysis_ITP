		<content>  Hawkchurch is in the county of Devon,
 quite near the county border with     
 Dorset and is in a designated area of 
 outstanding natural beauty. The       
 highest point in the parish is about  
 550 feet above sea level and it covers
 the eastern slopes of the Axe valley. 
 The village is called 'Village of     
 Roses' because about 100 years ago    
 Rev. J. Going paid to have roses      
 planted against the walls of all the  
 main street cottages. The area        
 surrounding the village is mainly     
 pastureland used by farmers. The soil 
 consists of sand and clay known       
 locally as 'Foxmould' and 'Red Scrip'.
