{Farm}for 28 years and each morning    
 they have to get up at approximately  
 6:30 a.m. to feed the animals.        
   The Groom's have changed the farm   
 since they lived there in two ways;   
 drained it and ploughed the fields.   
 Altogether there are 58 acres of wheat
 and 150 acres of grass.               
   The Groom's have two small and six  
 large cattle sheds which altogether   
 hold 200 cows. They have 65 limousin  
 cattle, four bulls, 600 sheep and two 
 sheepdogs. They no longer have a dairy
 herd.                                 
   The three months of winter are the  
 busiest time of the year. Only two men
 work on the farm one is Mr. Groom and 
 the other a farm labourer. Their house
 is very old; the oldest part is{350   
{years old.}Their land covers 208      
 acres.                                </content>
