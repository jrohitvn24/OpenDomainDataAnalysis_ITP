		<title>15A Day in the Life of a Child</title>
		<content> I am going to tell you about a typical
 day in my life in East Winch. Iam a   
 boy of ten years of age and I live    
 with my mum and dad in a bungalow in  
 East Winch. I live on the opposite    
 side of the main road to the school   
 and there are about twenty other      
 bungalows like ours where I live. All 
 the children who live near us go to   
 the primary school in East Winch      
 except the older ones like my sister  
 who goes to Gaywood Park High School  
 in King's Lynn. After we have all had 
 our breakfast my sister is the first  
 to leave. She goes to catch her bus at
 ten past eight when I am still having 
 my toast. Dad is the next to leave    
 about five minutes later. He works at 
 a food factory in an industrial estate
 on the outskirts of King's Lynnand has
 to be there at half past eight. Dad   
 goes in the car.                      </content>
