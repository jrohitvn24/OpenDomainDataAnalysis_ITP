		<title>13A DAY IN MY LIFE AT SCHOOL</title>
		<content>              by Leah Watson.          
                                       
   I come downstairs at 8 o'clock.     
 After breakfast I clean my teeth,     
 collect my lunch box and set off for  
 school with my sister Nadine.  After  
 a brief game in the playground we go  
 into school, get our hymn books and go
 into assembly.  Mr. Beeby talks to us 
 about all sorts of different things,  
 we sing a hymn, say a prayer and some-
 times Mr. Beeby has some news for us. 
   After assembly we do some Maths or  
 English,then it is playtime. Most of  
 us have some tuck to eat such as      
 crisps,biscuits,or fruit.  We play out
 in the playground when it is fine, if 
 wet,we stay indoors,play games,draw or
 read. Sometimes we write a story after
 play.  After lunch today we did a     
 project on flowers,then apparatus work
 in the hall. We go home at 3.30p.m.   </content>
