		<title>02History, Thurleigh</title>
		<content> The area has been inhabited since the 
 Iron Age and Roman times. Evidence of 
 this were found during recent         
 archaeological excavations undertaken 
 at Vicarage Green before the new      
 houses were built here, in the form of
 Roman pottery.The present village did 
 not come into existence until the     
 Saxon period, from where the name     
 originates -'Leah' meaning clearing.  
 Thurleigh is mentioned in the 1086    
 Domesday Survey. The main part of the 
 village, in Mediaeval times was at    
 Bury Hill, here stood Thurleigh       
 Castle, a classic example of motte and
 bailey with a large central mound     
 surrounded by courtyards and          
 originally defined by ditches. The    
 castle was a Baron castle ,built      
 without the permission of the King and
 therefore did not remain long. There  
 are other moated sites also.          </content>
