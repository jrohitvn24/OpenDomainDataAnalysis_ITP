		<content>   In{Hampton-in-Arden}there is a local
{Arts and Crafts Society.}Each year    
 they hold an Arts and Crafts          
 Exhibition in the village at Fentham  
 Hall. The{Exhibition}takes place on a 
 Saturday and Sunday and about 700     
 people usually visit it, with the     
 busiest times being for coffee in the 
 mornings and tea and cakes in the     
 afternoons. There are usually about 40
 exhibitors, 18 of which are local     
 artists ranging from self-taught      
 amateurs to professionally-taught     
 artists. About 30 to 40 of the        
 visitors actually buy paintings. Work 
 by other craftsmen is on show and     
 there is also a display of work by    
 children from the village school. One 
 of the local craftswomen, Mrs. Beechey
 visits the school once a week to run a
{needlework club}for about 20 of the   
 children who make clothes and softtoys</content>
