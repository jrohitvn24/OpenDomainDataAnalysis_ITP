		<content> There are three churches in{Hedon}    
 St.Mary and St.Joseph,the Roman       
 Catholic church.The Methodist church  
 and St.Augustines which is Church of  
 England.St.Augustines is known as the 
 "King of Holderness" and was started  
 in 1190 and is a Grade 1 listed       
 building.After a delay due to the     
 Black Death in 1368 the tower was     
 built in 1427 and the church completed
 in 1500 A.D. Since then it has been   
 constantly repaired and renovated with
 the addition of new windows in the    
 19th and early 20th centuries.The     
 Methodist and Roman Catholic churches 
 are much younger. The Methodist church
 was built in 1926 and the Roman       
 Catholic church in 1805. The original 
 Methodist church was destroyed by     
 bombing in W.W.1 whilst the Roman     
 Catholic church  also suffered damage 
 to all but one of its windows.        </content>
