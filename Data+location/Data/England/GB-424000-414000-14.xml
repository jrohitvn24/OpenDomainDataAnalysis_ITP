   Both villages i.e. Flockton and     
 Netherton have a proportion of council
 houses, this is probably under 50% of 
 the houses. The remainder are owner   
 occupied properties.                  
   Netherton in perticular has a large 
 number of recently built properties,  
 ( within the last 10-15 years ).      
   These houses are family houses with 
 3 and 4 bedrooms, garages, central    
 heating and gardens. There are also   
 several fairly isolated farmhouses but
 none are more than 1/2 mile away from 
 other properties.
