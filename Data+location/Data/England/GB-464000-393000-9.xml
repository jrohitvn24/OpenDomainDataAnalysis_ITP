		<title>09Trading in Bawtry</title>
		<content>  There are the usual retail businesses
 including a branch of the Doncaster   
 bakers Cooplands. There are also four 
 branch offices of Building Societies  
 and a branch bank. Considerable       
 disturbance is caused by the car      
 auction on Tuesday and Friday         
 evenings. Severe traffic jams result  
 from clients' cars parked in streets  
 close to the centrally placed premises
 and loud engine noises can be heard   
 for some distance.Opposite the auction
 are the workshops of Mayflower        
 Furniture where cabinets,tables,chairs
 and picture frames are made.Elm,beech,
 oak and mahogany are used.In the      
 market square is a quality car dealer 
 and on the outskirts of the town is a 
 truck dealer. 2 miles N. of Bawtry on 
 the A638 is Yorkshire Caravans. On    
 this large site new and used caravans 
 are bought,sold,stored and repaired.  </content>
