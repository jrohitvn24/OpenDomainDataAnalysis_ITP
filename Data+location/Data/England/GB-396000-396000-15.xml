		<content> Near our school, there are several    
 industrial works. These two, described
 by two children, are typical.         
 'Steadfast Engineering makes special  
 fasteners, like nuts and bolts. They  
 are used on gas and oil pipelines.    
 There are 23 workers, and the firm    
 started 8 years ago. All their goods  
 are sent to America, The Middle East, 
 Europe and Britain. We found this out 
 by phoning the firm on its radiophone 
 number. They were very helpful, and   
 pleased to be included in the survey.'
 Parker Timber deals with all kinds of 
 wood. They make mouldings, joinery    
 timber, pallets, timber frames,       
 constructional and fencing timber,    
 farmwork timber and shutterply. We    
 were surprised to learn that the firm 
 is closing down in two weeks time.    
 Some people will lose their jobs.'
