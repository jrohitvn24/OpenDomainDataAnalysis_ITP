		<title>12MARWOOD S. THE CHURCH HALL</title>
		<content>    Our church hall used to be a       
 school.Now it is used for lots of     
 parish activities.It belongs to the   
 church but it can be hired out.       
    The playgroup uses the hall the    
 most,two days a week during term time.
 This is for children from             
 3_5years.There is also a Mum and      
 Toddlers group which combine with a   
 keep fit class.                       
    At the weekends and bank holidays  
 the church members help their funds by
 making cream teas for visitors to     
 Marwood Gardens.                      
    The civil defence group hold       
 meetings there and the Adventureres   
 and Teenagers have parties and fund   
 raising events there.                 
    There is a flower and vegetable    
 show held there in July or August.    
    The sports and social committee    
 run whist drives discos and parties.  </content>
