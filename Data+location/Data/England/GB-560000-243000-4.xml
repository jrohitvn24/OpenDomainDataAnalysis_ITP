		<title>04Mill Green</title>
		<content> Mill Green is on a small road between 
 Shudy Camps and Horseheath. There are 
 not many people to play with here. I  
 go to Castle Camps school.Every       
 morning the school bus stops outside  
 my gate at 10 to 9.  I don't have to  
 pay for the bus. It is usually on     
 time.In Mill Green every house has got
 a garden.In my garden my dad has grown
 2 weeping willows 1 crab apple tree 5 
 hdges 2 patches of rhubarb and a few  
 more trees.About 100 yards away from  
 my house there is a place where  a    
 moat used to be.                      
 My brother has just started school as 
 he is nearly five. One other girl gets
 on the bus at my stop. I think I would
 like to live a bit nearer to a few    
 other people.
