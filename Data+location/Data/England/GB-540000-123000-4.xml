  Mr Ernest Moore (Ernie) was born five
 minutes after midnight on July 13th   
 1902 in his parents house at Fletching
 . He started school when he was four. 
 Then there were 189 pupils now there  
 are only 49.                          
 School started at 8.55 but he went    
 early to clean the lavatories, mix the
 ink and bring in the coal.            
        He joined the church choir at  
 five leaving when his voice broke.    
 Since then he has played the organ in 
 church for 53 years.                  
 In 1916 he left school (at 12 y 6 m)  
 and took a job as a grocers apprentice
 at the grocers shop (now general store
 and Post Office) in the High Street.  
 It was a difficult job with rationing 
 in the First World War.He earned 15   
 shillings a week which would now be   
 75p.      {C Rutter and R Bishop      </content>
