		<title>01THE AREA OF ILMINGTON</title>
		<content>                                       
 Our area is on a slope of the{Cotswold
 Hills which give it shelter.The       
 highest land is in the south west and 
 it slopes down to the east.Little     
 streams run down to the River{Stour } 
 in the valley bottom.Standing on      
{Ilmington}Hill a network of roads and 
 paths can be clearly picked out.They  
 lead in all directions.Many long      
 public footpaths go into the hills and
 villages which makes it an ideal      
 walking area.The whole area is a      
 patchwork of mixed{farms.}There is    
 only one village in our block,{       
{Ilmington}.{Ilmington}means "Elms on  
 the hill", but not one of those       
 beautiful trees now remains although  
 most others thrive here.The {village} 
 kept open by a series of greens       
 throughout its length.
