		<title>08ST. MARY'S CHURCH.</title>
		<content> The oldest part of this{Norman}church 
 is the base of the tower which dates  
 from the end of the 12th century. A   
 probable{Saxon}Cross is built into the
 outside of the North wall suggesting a
 possible earlier church on the site.  
 The chancel is{Early English}but the  
 nave was rebuilt in 1841 and added at 
 the same time were the aisles and the 
 south porch. The nave was again       
 rebuilt after a fire in 1867. Brought 
 into the Church after the fire was the
 beautiful early{15th century}pulpit   
 once in the old parish church of      
 Milton until it was destroyed together
 with the village. The font also dates 
 back to the{15th century.}Born in 1862
 to the then Rector of Whitechurch was 
 Samuel Wesley father of{Charles and   
{John Wesley.}This beautiful church    
 attracts many visitors from all over  
 the world.                            </content>
