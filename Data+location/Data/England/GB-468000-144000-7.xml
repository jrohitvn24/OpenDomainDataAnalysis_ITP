		<content>  Oil: The study area includes a large 
 part of the 2nd largest on-shore      
 oilfield in U.K.estimated to produce  
 4000 barrels per day in Phase 1 from  
 65 wells on 8 wellsites. 3 of the well
 sites and the gathering station and   
 production are in the block. These    
 cover an area of 10 acres in woodland 
 on Weston Common. Oil,gas and water   
 extracted from the wellsites will be  
 pumped to the gathering station by    
 pipeline where the gas and water will 
 be separated from the oil the gas     
 compressed and both gas and water     
 pumped back into the wellsites to     
 create pressure to raise the oil to   
 the surface. Oil will be pumped by    
 pipeline to the rail/road head at     
 Alton. The oilfield is expected to    
 last for 25/30years and production may
 be doubled during that period.
