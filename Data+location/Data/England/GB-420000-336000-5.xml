		<title>05THE OLD FORGE</title>
		<content>    The old forge was originally built 
 in 1866 of brick and tile.The two old 
 fireplaces are still there, though    
 there are quite a few loose bricks.   
    There is a big section that has    
 double doors and a wooden exit door at
 the back of the forge.                
    In the second section there are    
 double doors that lead out to the     
 front and a door that leads into the  
 bigger part.                          
    There are two stables, the horses  
 were kept there while waiting to be   
 shod. There are three rings, the      
 horses were tied to them while they   
 were being shod.                      
    At the end of the forge it says the
 builders initials which are E.C. The  
 forge is not used for its original    
 purpose but as a store.
