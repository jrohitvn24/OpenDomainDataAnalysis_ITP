 is predominantly a {FARMING}area.The  
 landscape is covered by a patchwork of
{ARABLE FIELDS}growing mostly wheat and
 barley.There are some fields kept for 
 hay to feed sheep and cattle.The      
 livestock is mostly kept on rough     
 grassland near the two rivers the     
 River Anton and the River Test.
