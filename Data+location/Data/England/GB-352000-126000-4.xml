		<content> The church of{St Mary the Virgin      
 consists of chancel, north vestry,    
 central tower, transepts, nave and    
 south porch. The fabric is of 14th    
 central origin with much refashioning 
 in the 15th century but a drastic     
 restoration of c. 1847 has somewhat   
 obscured the architectural history.   
 The most outstanding feature is the   
 end window of the north transept with 
 elaborate and beautiful tracery of c. 
 (1330).The rest of the windows have   
 been largely renewed.Painted glass in 
 the West window and in some of the    
 chancel windows had to be removed for 
 safety reasons some years ago.They    
 were replaced by clear and green      
 tinted panes.The church was remodelled
 in Victorian times but fortunately the
 Norman font has remained intact.This  
 is the main feature of the Lyte's     
 Chapel which was renovated recently.  </content>
