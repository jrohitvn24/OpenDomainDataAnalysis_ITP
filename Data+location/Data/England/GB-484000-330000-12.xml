		<content> I am called Emily Oldfield.I live in a
 small village called Denton.I like    
 running,I like playing the recorder   
 and piano.I wear dresses, skirts,     
 trousers and tracksuits.My Mum works  
 as a teacher in a secondary school.   
 She teaches art. When she comes home  
 from work she likes to sit down with a
 cup of tea. My dad loves gardening. He
 does not work in the garden on working
 days because he gets tired but he     
 works in the garden on free days. He  
 works as a teacher in a polytechnic.  
 My sister Sally loves reading.She     
 keeps reading books she likes over and
 over again even if they are too young 
 for her. She goes to the same school  
 as me. My grandma lives with us as    
 well.She likes plants as well as my   
 dad but she has indoor ones because   
 they are easier to get to.
