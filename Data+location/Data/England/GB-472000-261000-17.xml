  At the bottom of Rye Hill there are  
27 units.Units are homes for old       
people.At the top end of Rye Hill there
are also 27 units, 54 in all.          
  Two wardens control the units one at 
the top and one at the bottom.Both     
wardens have two days off a week.The   
other warden looks after all 54 units  
on those days.                         
  There are also many houses on Rye    
Hill but there are only two shops on   
the whole estate.They are a Newsagent  
and an Off License.These are in        
Montague Crescent.There is also only   
one Post Box on the Estate.            
  Two bus routes,number 3 and number 7 
serve the Rye Hill estate.So there     
is one bus every 30 minutes to Town    
Centre on weekdays.There are less buses
on Sundays.
