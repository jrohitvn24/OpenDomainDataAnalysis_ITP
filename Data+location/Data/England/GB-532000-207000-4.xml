		<title>04FANSHAW HOUSE,BRICKENDON</title>
		<content> In 1855 Mr Henry Saunders,fearful that
 should he die in bed the spiral stair_
 case of his home would be too narrow  
 to accommodate a coffin, decided to   
 build a new home. This was Fanshaws   
 set in 270 acres, a Jacobean style red
 brick house, with 12 bedrooms &amp;       
 servants quarters.  Ironically Mr     
 Saunders died of a heart attack in    
 Bayford church in 1888!  In 1912 the  
 house was extended &amp; remained a family
 home until 1962. Since 1963 it has    
 been the offices of the Institute of  
 the Motor Industry &amp; its preservation 
 &amp; maintenance is ensured. 28 are      
 employed there. On 12th June l985 a   
 garden party was held to celebrate    
 both the centenary of the motor car &amp; 
 the house itself. 400 guests enjoyed a
 unique display of vintage and modern  
 motor vehicles,with music by the band 
 of the 1st Queens Dragoon Guards!     </content>
