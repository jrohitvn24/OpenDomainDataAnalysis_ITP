		<content> Sheep have for a long time been the   
 dominant activity but now cereals are 
 taking the lead, particularly winter  
 wheat and winter barley.              
 Farms are very isolated but the baker 
 and the milkman call.  They employ few
 labourers, one farmer employs only an 
 independent contractor who lives      
 locally.                              
 The farmer at Dynes Barn Farm has     
 owned the farm for thirty years.  He  
 has 100 acres with poultry, wheat,    
 some peas and a few calves and horses.
 He employs one farm labourer.  Winter 
 wheat has been grown for some years   
 and maize is grown for silage.  The   
 cattle are beef, mostly Hereford      
 cross.  The farmer is experimenting   
 with asparagus as a cash crop.        
 1985 has not had very adverse effect  
 except that the crop took longer to   
 dry out.                              </content>
