   There is also an overshadowed pond  
 which is covered by a scum.This stops 
 oxygen from getting through so animals
 are scarcely seen.But under logs you  
 will find earwigs and wood lice.

 set up Long Worth Mammal Traps.We are 
 hoping to erect a hide on an          
 overlooking mound of earth. Recently  
 someone has seen a fox and            
 several kestrels have been spotted.   </content>
