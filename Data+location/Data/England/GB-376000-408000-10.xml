 of open land and as most of the       
 recreational opportunities result in  
 using the{open air environment.       
 There are numerous{footpaths}through  
 the fields which allow{ramblers}and   
{walkers}to enjoy the countryside.     
 There are many{private stables}from   
 which horse riders can exercise their 
 mounts;although nowhere is there the  
 opportunity to hire a horse.          
{Elton Reservoir}and the numerous      
 lodges in the area provide{fishing.   
 Many of these are reserved for private
 clubs.The reservoir is fishable on a  
 daily basis and is much used.

{sailing club}from 1846 when it was a  
 gentlemen's rowing club.It now        
 supports over one hundred sailing     
 boats.
