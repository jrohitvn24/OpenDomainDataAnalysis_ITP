		<title>19PEOPLE OF THE SELSFIELD AREA</title>
		<content> With no villages in the area,         
{population}is sparse. Many of the     
 inhabitants still live and{work on the
{land}but there has been an increasing 
 tendency in recent years for          
{professional people}to move into the  
 area and{commute}for work to{London}or
 other nearby towns, or to the         
 industrial areas of{Crawley}and       
{Gatwick Airport.                      
   There are relatively few long       
 established families left in the area.
 People of considerable private means  
 live in the several large houses. A   
 large proportion of the land is owned 
 by relatively few people. Clustered   
 around the edge of{Selsfield Common   
 are a number of{smallholdings.        
   As there is no focal point for the  
 area people tend to gravitate towards 
 the nearest village for social and    
 educational needs.                    </content>
