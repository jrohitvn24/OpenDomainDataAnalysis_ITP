 There is a Dog Show which includes    
 classes for pedigree and working dogs 
 as well as family events such as 'the 
 dog with the waggiest tail'.Donkeys   
 are brought in for a{Donkey Derby     
 where local people ride the donkeys   
 and betting is keen if not extravagant
 Porlock Teams build their own rafts   
 from things like oil drums to enter in
 the{Raft Race}from nearby Porlock Weir
 to Bossington Beach.Often rafts,fan-  
 tastically decorated,are not seaworthy
 and sink to everyone's amusement.Each 
 year a{Pantomime}is written and       
 produced involving lots of people     
 acting,singing,making costumes and    
 painting scenery.It plays to capacity 
 audiences,mainly local in January and 
 visitors in August.
