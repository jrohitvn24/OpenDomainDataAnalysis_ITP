 The  children  in  Harbottle School   
 have  cats, dogs, birds, mice, fish,  
 and rabbits as their pets.The kinds of
 birds are budgies and  peacocks.      
   The kinds of dogs are terrier,      
 collie, and spaniel.The dog is the    
 most popular pet in our school.There  
 are 8 working dogs owned by families  
 of children in our school.            
   The working dogs are in the main    
 Border Collies and they are used in   
 the movement of sheep.They are        
 controlled by whistle commands or     
 shouts.Phrases used are 'way by' and  
 'Come by'.These orders control        
 movements to the right and left.Some  
 dogs are trained to retreive game     
 after shooting.Young foxhounds are    
 kept on farms to get used to farm     
 animals before they go out hunting.
