		<title>01The Scarp Behind Clyffe Pypa</title>
		<content> The main feature of the area is the   
 hill which runs from behind your grid 
 9 to 6 to 3 to 4.   the land rises    
 slowly from the south-east (ordinance 
 survey grid ref. 74/75) and scarps    
 within this area.   In the rest the   
 land is undulating.   The land is     
 agricultural, mainly mixed farming,   
 most farms having milking cows.   The 
 small community is closely knit; all  
 resident appear to enjoy living in the
 area; some are farmers, others commute
 to surrounding towns, mainly Swindon.
