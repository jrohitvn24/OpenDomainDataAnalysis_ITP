		<title>02Darras Hall Estate</title>
		<content> In{1907,}1014 acres of wet-land were  
 purchased by the Northern Allotment   
 Society in the{Darras Hall}area       
 containing 3 farm houses(all of which 
 still stand).By 1911 the land was     
 divided into lots and roads were laid 
 out to form the beginnings of a garden
 town.The estate has grown steadily    
 over the years and now contains more  
 than 2000 properties,most of which,   
 under the{Darras Hall Trust Deed,}have
 gardens of at least a quarter of an   
 acre.                                 
        Each family pays an annual rent
 charge (Â£5 in 1985). This pays for    
 office accommodation on the estate for
 a secretary and administrative officer
 and an elected committee of residents 
 looks after the interests of the      
 estate, keeping residents informed    
 about local happenings by means of a  
 newsletter.                           </content>
