		<content> 168 houses are permanently occupied   
 and there are 35 holiday or second    
 homes and 9 houses for sale.  42 peo- 
 ple live alone. Most houses are owner 
 occupied.  At Wearhead a few houses   
 were built between the wars and       
 several since, including a small brick
 built Council Estate with 4 Old       
 People's bungalows.  2 houses faced   
 with stone have recently been built at
 Ireshopeburn but most houses are at   
 least 150 years old. The farm at Low  
 Burn is dated 1605.  Houses are gener-
 ally well cared for, many having been 
 improved with the aid of council      
 grants. Farm buildings have been used 
 for extensions to adjoining houses and
 for conversion into dwellings or      
 garages. Gardens are well kept. Flow- 
 ers, vegetables and soft fruit are    
 grown and some households have green- 
 houses.                               </content>
