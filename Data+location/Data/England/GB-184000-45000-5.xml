		<title>05A Visit To Penair</title>
		<content> In September I will be going to Penair
 School.This term I went to find out   
 what it is like.                      
 On Wed. 17th of July I visited Penair 
 School.The head of the 1st year took  
 me from the main gate into the main   
 hall.I was with the other children    
 going there next term and we all sat  
 in rows in the hall with the the other
 visitors.I thought it was really      
 strange and probably the rest of us   
 felt it too.There were 5 form tutors  
 sitting in a row and I wondered if one
 would teach me.At dinner I bought a   
 pasty and a chocolate ball and a glass
 of coke.All the food seemed very cheap
 and I had not expected this.          
 We walked into our class rooms and    
 filled out forms with questions like  
 "when were you born?" etc.Later we    
 had our first lesson,English.I think I
 will enjoy it here,next term.         </content>
