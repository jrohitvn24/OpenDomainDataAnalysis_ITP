		<title>17HOUSES IN LITTLE WITLEY-1</title>
		<content>   Little Witley is a rural area       
 containing many farmhouses and        
 cottages between{two and three hundred
{years old.}All properties have        
 electricity and pumped water. Hand    
 pumps over wells remain only as       
 ornaments.                            
{  Farmhouses}are of local reddish     
 brick from local brickyards.Some are  
 half timbered and painted black and   
 white on stone foundations. Roofs are 
 predominantly tiled, occasionally     
 slated, seldom thatched. The tops of  
 the window frames are                 
 characteristically rounded and porches
 shelter the doors. About half the     
{smaller houses}are of similar age and 
 materials and these have often been   
 extended or enlarged.
