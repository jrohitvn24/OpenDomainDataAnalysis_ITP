 Naunton Beauchamp is a typical example
 of the buildings and landscape to be  
 found in this area.   Local lias stone
 is used in Naunton Court and in       
 various local barns and pig styes. The
 very mixed housing consists of 5      
 timbered houses, 2 thatchings,1       
 Victorian house (once a pair of       
 cottages), 1 large Georgian farmhouse,
 a Smithy dated 1865, 4 Agricultural   
 Council (workers) houses circa 193O,  
 3O modern properties and 1 'Colt'type 
 bungalow.  The church also is built of
 Blue Lias. The whole area is a        
 landscape of gently sloping           
 countryside; pasture and fallow fields
 with the odd clump of trees, a few    
 isolated farmhouses and the four      
 villages.                             </content>
