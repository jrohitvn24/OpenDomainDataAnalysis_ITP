		<title>14WHITE LODGE STUD FARM VISIT</title>
		<content> We visited Mr Kinsey the stud groom of
 White Lodge Stud Farm, and he showed  
 us round. The stud farm is 73 acres   
 and has 7 fields and about 60 horses. 
 The stud breeds horses for racing.    
 They only breed thoroughbred horses   
 because they are strong and they can  
 win races. Around the fields there are
 fences and there are hedges and trees.
 They are not there for eating, but for
 wind shelters.                        
 There is a field on the stud near the 
 main house where people can look over 
 from their garden to the field without
 a fence in the way. The horses cannot 
 escape because there is a dip in the  
 field.                                
 There is a big vegetable garden and   
 greenhouses on the stud. They grow the
 food for the stud owners who live in  
 London, and if they have too much food
 they give it to charity.              </content>
