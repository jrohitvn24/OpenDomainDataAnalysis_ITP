		<title>18A Cockermouth Family.</title>
		<content> There are five people in my family,my 
 dad, my mum and my two brothers called
 Simon and Thomas.My dad works at an   
 open cast coal site.In his spare time 
 he likes to go fell walking on the    
 mountains with Simon and I but he cant
 take Thomas yet because he is only    
 two. Mum does'nt work so you could    
 call her a houswife. One of the things
 she likes doing is working in the     
 garden.Simon is ten years old.He      
 spends a lot of time playing on his   
 bike and playing with Lego.Thomas my  
 other brother is two years old and    
 loves Roland Rat. In the morning      
 Thomas gets out of his cot and wakes  
 me up. At the moment we are potty     
 training him it is working a bit but  
 he usually tells mum that he wants to 
 go on the potty when he's done it in  
 his pants.                            
                                       </content>
