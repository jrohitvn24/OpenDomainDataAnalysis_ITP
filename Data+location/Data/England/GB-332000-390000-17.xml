		<title>17Central Station</title>
		<content>    In the 1960's the main line station
 was demolished and  Central Stn became
 part of Merseyrail underground system,
 forming an intersection for the Wirral
 Loop Line and the  Northern Link Line.
                                       
   {In  1984  the front half was opened
{as a light,clean and spacious shopping
{arcade  with domed glass roof, twenty-
{one shops,  hanging baskets of flowers
{suspended  from the roof and  complete
{with security guards equipped with two
{way radio.                            
                                       
    Shoppers  and  shopkeepers like the
 arcade  but  business  is quiet during
 the week,the busiest shops being those
 which appeal to passing trade. Overall
 the  arcade  is a vast  improvement to
 the area  but not many people think of
 it as a place for stopping and looking
  - still less for serious shopping.   </content>
