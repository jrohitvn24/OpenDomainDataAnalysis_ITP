		<content>     The Rector of Barnburgh is also   
 responsible for St.Jame's Church at   
 High Melton. High Melton is a small   
 village about a mile to the east of   
 Barnburgh.Unlike St. Peter's          
 Church,St. Jame's has no known        
 legends,it has Norman features and    
 contains numerous fragments of old    
 stained glass.High Melton is quite a  
 small village, and part of the        
 population is situated on Melton Mill 
 Lane, a little way away.The two       
 churches organise special events.In   
 1984 they held Summer Flower Festivals
 and Mystery Plays were performed in   
 the Barnburgh Rectory garden.There are
 approximately 80 to 90 houses.High    
 Melton Hall,built in 1757 is now      
 integrated into a modern education    
 complex which is part of Doncaster    
 Institute of Higher Education.
