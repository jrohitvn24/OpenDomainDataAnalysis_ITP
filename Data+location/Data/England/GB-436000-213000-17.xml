		<content>Our D-block is situated in the country 
side. The main village is North Leigh, 
the nearest town is Witney which is two
miles away. Because it is in the       
country, there are not many public     
services.  There are two shops, one    
garage, one school, two public houses, 
one post office, one library, two      
telephone boxes and a vet. There is no 
doctor, dentist, fire service or police
station. For these services you would  
have to go to Witney. A bus travels    
through North Leigh, but not very      
often. There are four bus stops. If a  
fire broke out, the fire engine would  
have to come from Witney. If there was 
a car crash, the police would take a   
long time to arrive as well.
