		<title>01The Island of Alderney</title>
		<content>  Alderney is the third largest of the 
 Channel Islands.It is perhaps the only
 true Channel Island as it is the most 
 northerly and therefore actually in   
 the English Channel.It is about five  
 kms long and two kms wide and is only 
 ten kms from France - a fact that has 
 had a decisive effect on its history. 
   It is an island of contrasts - the  
 eastern end of the island is flat and 
 has many fine beaches while the       
 western end has some spectacular      
 cliffs.On either side of the island   
 are fierce tidal currents which in    
 particular places can run up to ten   
 knots.                                
   In 1981 2056 people lived on the    
 island and its revenue was derived    
 from retirement income,fishing        
 ,farming,finance and tourism.
