		<content> There is not much employment in our   
 area, mostly it is agricultural       
 although even then there are becoming 
 less and less jobs for people to do.  
  About twenty to twenty five people   
 work on the land.                     
  Twenty people work for the Gas Board 
 but out of those only one lives in the
 area.                                 
  Two people work at the church, Mr    
 McLaren and the caretaker Mr          
 Pickering.                            
  There is a small riding stable near  
 the church and it employs four girls  
 part time to look after the horses.   
  The light house empoys one man and   
 Bulk Storage employ fourteen people as
 either storemen or lorry drivers.Out  
 of these only two men are local men.  
  There used to be losts of work as    
 local fishermen but not any more      
 because of the pollution in the river.</content>
