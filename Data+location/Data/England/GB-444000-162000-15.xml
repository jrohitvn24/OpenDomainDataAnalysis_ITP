		<content> In our block there are no doctors,    
 dentists or hospitals so people have  
 to go into Newbury. We carried out    
 some surveys on the parents of        
 children in our class and found that  
 only 4 people have been to hospital in
 the last year and only 2 people in the
 last week. Only 7 adults surveyed have
 been to the doctors in the last year, 
 6 in the last month and 4 in the last 
 week. In our area we are fairly       
 healthy. Most people went to the      
 dentists every 6 months. This week    
 the school dentist visited us and     
 looked at all the childrens teeth. If 
 there was anything wrong, we had to   
 take a note home. No children in our  
 class had to take a note home. We also
 found that most children were         
 vaccinated against measles, whooping  
 cough, diptheria and polio.
