		<content> On our first walk,between Bramley and 
 Silchester,we saw some men working on 
 a house.The strange thing about it was
 that the barn/house they were building
 looked really old but it was brand new
   The men were putting old fashioned  
 tiles and beams on the house .They    
 even copied the idea of having {      
{SADDLESTONES},so that when anyone went
 past it,they thought it was an old    
 house.                                
  {In-filling}building  is building    
 done on fields or open spaces between 
 existing buildings instead of adding  
 on to edges of a village or town.     
   In {BRAMLEY},at the moment,all the  
 new building is {IN-FILLING.}People   
 have to get planning permission first 
 from the council, but this probably   
 easier to do in Bramley than in       
 somewhere like London which has       
 fewer fields/open spaces available.   </content>
