		<title>09The Local Policeman.</title>
		<content>   We interviewed P.C.Woodcock. He came
 to work in this parish in 1983 after 9
 years in the R.A.F. He trained in Kent
 for 10 weeks where he studied Law and 
 physical fitness.                     
   On joining the police he got a motor
 cycle, uniform, handcuffs &amp; truncheon.
 He lives with his wife and family in a
 police house.His wife acts as his     
 secretary. His beat consists of 7     
 parishes which he patrols 8 hours a   
 day and he is on 24 hr. call. Typical 
 crimes in the area are burglaries,    
 theft and vandalism. He detects an    
 overall increase in the crime rate.   
   In his spare time he fishes and does
 a lot of work in local schools. He is 
 very happy working in this area and   
 does not want promotion and he has    
 never seriously thought about         
 retirement.
