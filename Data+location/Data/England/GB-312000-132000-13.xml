		<title>13THE PEAR ORCHARD</title>
		<content> There is a path going through the     
 middle of the pear orchard.           
 The trees are in straight rows.       
 When the trees are too big some of    
 them are taken out every 25 years.    
 The pears from the pear orchard go to 
 Shepton Mallet to be made into        
 Babycham.                             
 We saw bees. The bees are there to    
 pollenate the pear trees.             
 There are lots of different trees in  
 the orchard. The leaves on some of the
 trees are different. There are all    
 different kinds of barks on the trees.
 These are all the kinds of pears:     
 Butt, Red pear, Barnet, Hendre        
 Huffcap, Winnals Longdon, Brown Bess, 
 Bradley, New Bridge, Thorn, Hellens   
 Early, Green Horse and Brandy.        
 There are sheep to keep the grass     
 down.                                 
                                       </content>
