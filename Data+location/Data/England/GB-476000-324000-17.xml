		<content> We have foxes in our area so the      
{Belvoir Hunt}meets here at least twice
 a year, once at The King's Arms in    
 Scalford and once at Goadby Marwood.  
   The riders come from many miles     
 around and eventually set off, after a
 drink,followed (on the roads)by people
 in cars who want to watch.            
  {Prince Charles}often hunts with The 
 Belvoir so people drive out from the  
 town hoping to see him or{Princess    
{Diana}if she is following the Hunt.   
   Perhaps Hunt following is           
 hungry work.Princess Di once asked for
 a packet of{salt and vinegar crisps}in
 Scalford P.O. The shopkeeper, (who    
 didn't look up from his work) told her
 they were{"Over there me duck!" }     
   After she had left the shop there   
 was a great demand for salt and       
 vinegar crisps causing a temporary    
{local shortage.    }                  </content>
