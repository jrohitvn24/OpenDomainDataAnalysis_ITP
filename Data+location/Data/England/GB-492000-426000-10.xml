		<title>10HUMBER GROWERS - FARMING</title>
		<content> The company was formed in 1961 as a   
 co_operative of local growers. It     
 covers 150 acres of computer          
 controlled heated glass houses,       
 producing 34 million cucumbers beween 
 February and October 1984, and        
 860,000 lettuces between November     
 1984 and January 1985. Heating is in  
 the process of being converted from   
 oil to coal, at an estimated yearly   
 saving of Â£1.25 million. Other salad  
 crops are produced on a relatively    
 small scale throughout the year.      
 Produce is supplied to most major     
 cities in Britain, including the large
 supermarket chains of Sainsburys,     
 Tesco, Marks &amp; Spencer, Littlewoods,  
 and Argyle. To meet all year demands, 
 Humber Growers have recently developed
 links with continental countries and  
 are now expanding their fruit and     
 vegetable interests.                  </content>
