      In our school we have two        
 playgrounds and a football pitch.     
 There are two blocks of buildings. In 
 the top block there are two classrooms
 and a classroom attached to a         
 swimming pool.  There are Girls and   
 Boys toilets and changing rooms.      
      In the bottom block there are    
 three classrooms and a big dinner     
 hall.  At the back of the hall are the
 school kitchens where they serve our  
 dinner at 12.10 pm.  Some of us bring 
 sandwiches or go home to dinner.      
      This is an average meal - a      
 choice of curry and rice,fishcake and 
 peas or salad and potatoes.           
      We also have a big Library, &amp; an 
 Art room with TV,Video and a computer.
  There are also two bike sheds and a  
 garden with flowers,trees and a pond.
