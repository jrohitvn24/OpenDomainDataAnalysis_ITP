		<title>20Games we play</title>
		<content> In the playground we play many games. 
 Sometimes we play skipping games like 
 "Colours".In this two people shake the
 rope on the ground, before they start 
 they both choose a colour and they    
 must not tell anyone else. Someone    
 then jumps over the rope and shouts   
 what they think the colour is. Another
 rope game is "Witches and Fairies" and
 another "Jump in when it's your       
 birthday". In this you jump through   
 the rope when your birthday month is  
 called. The ring games we play include
 "Cat's got the Measles" and "Farmers  
 in his Den". We also play Tag games   
 where one person has to be "It",and   
 tries to catch the other people.
