.....Because we went early we were able
get all our own shopping done before   
the rush started and arrived home in   
time for Elizabeth to watch Playschool 
whilst I made my husband and I a cup of
coffee and I prepared the lunch. Nick  
and Richard came home from school at   
12.10p.m. in time to see Mooncat and   
Company while I put lunch out.After    
lunch,and making sure that Nick and    
Richard were back at school for 1p.m. I
washed the pots and cleaned the        
kitchen.My husband needed help to make 
a delivery,then I was able to clean    
through the house,make out an          
invoice before collecting Nick and     
Richard from school.Today I had to go  
to the local shop for a jelly to       
accompany the strawberries I had       
boughtt  in the morning.
