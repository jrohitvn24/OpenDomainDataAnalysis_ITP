    This area is very{flat},lying at   
 sea level or below,and is {drained}by 
 a system of ditches known locally as  
 rhynes(reens).At one time the         
 area was under water.The village of   
 Westonzoyland is composed mainly of   
 modern housing with some older larger 
 properties and farmhouses.The village 
 is dominated by the large church with 
 it's handsome fifteenth century       
 tower.Looking across the land one can 
 see good grazing land mixed with crops
 and copses of trees dotted around the 
 fields.Many of the trees are dead Elms
 having succumbed to Dutch Elm         
 disease and these are being gradually 
 cleared.In the distance are the       
 Quantock Hills (350metres high) and   
 Poldens (100metres) 1 mile away to the
 North. Our rectangle is an example of 
 The Somerset levels.                  </content>
