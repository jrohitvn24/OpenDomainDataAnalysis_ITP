		<title>13THE BLOCKWORKS, UFFCULME</title>
		<content>  The Blockworks was purchased from    
{Andrews and Miller,}a local firm, by  
{E.C.C.}in{1976.}In{1982}it was rebuilt
 and at this time was one of the most  
 modern plants of its kind in Europe.  
 It can produce up to 200 000 blocks   
 per week. There are{sixty different   
{types of block produced}with varying  
 strengths and finishes. Most of the   
 blocks produced are sold in the local 
 area but some of the more specialised 
 ones go as far afield as{London.      
{Sixteen people are employed}on the    
 production side and a further{twelve  
{are employed}to deliver the blocks on 
 the firms own lorries with  cranes    
 for loading and unloading the 'stacks'
 of blocks. No lorries now go through  
 Uffculme unless delivering there.     
 Apart from pumice,used in some blocks,
 and cement, all materials come from   
 E.C.C.'s adjacent{Hillhead Quarry.    </content>
