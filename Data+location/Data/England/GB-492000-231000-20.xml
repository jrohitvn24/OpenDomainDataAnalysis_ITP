		<title>20Farming in Woburn</title>
		<content> There are a number of farms in the    
 vicinity of Woburn, mainly leased from
 the Bedford estate.                   
 Park Farm owned by Lady Tavistock is a
 stud farm and reflects the family's   
 interest in racing.                   
 Other farms in the area include       
 Hundreds Farm, Job's Farm, Buttermilk 
 Farm, Apesfield Farm, Dolton's Farm,  
 Horsemoor Farm, Cold Harbour Farm and 
 Speedwell Farm. Hundreds Farm is now  
 redundant.                            
 Arable farming is predominant.        
 Strenuous efforts are being made to   
 update the farm machinery.
