		<title>06Puckeridge &amp;Thurlow Hunt</title>
		<content> The kennels which house the hounds of 
 the Puckeridge and Thurlow Hunt have  
 recently been newly built at          
 Wadgell's farm,part of the Thurlow    
 Estate.There are 37 couple of         
 hounds,looked after by the            
 huntsman,Albert Bunch,helped by the   
 whipper-in.The hounds are fed once a  
 day on raw flesh-such as calves which 
 have died on one of the farms,or      
 rabbits, shot by  one of the farmers. 
 They also have biscuits.They have to  
 be exercised eachh day and although   
 they have a large grassy run,Mr.Bunch 
 goes off on his bicycle for a couple  
 of hours early in the morning and the 
 hounds follow him. Puppies are named  
 by giving each a name with the same   
 initial as his father.There are       
 twice-weekly hunts during the         
 season,which lasts from October to    
 March.                                </content>
