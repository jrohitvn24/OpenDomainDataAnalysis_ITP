  Mrs.R.works in our school and has    
 lived in Warsop all her life.She likes
 Warsop for many reasons.She can buy   
 everything she needs in Warsop from   
 small household items to furniture!   
 Her milk and papers are delivered by  
 local traders.She can cash cheques at 
 the bank and post letters or buy      
 stamps at the Post Office.Mrs.R.can   
 pay her rates at the Council Offices. 
 If she is ill or has toothache she can
 visit the Health Centre or the Dental 
 Surgery.Mrs.R.goes weekly to the      
 hairdresser's and even books her      
 holidays abroad at a local travel     
 agency.                               
  There are also leisure facilities in 
 Warsop but Mrs.R.does not use them,   
 like the tennis courts,the B.M.X.track
 the swimming pool and the roller      
 disco!                                </content>
