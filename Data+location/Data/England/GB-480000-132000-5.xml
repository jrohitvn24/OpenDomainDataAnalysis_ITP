		<content> Conford Moor and Passfield Common     
 adajacent areas of National Trust also
 adjoin the military area, the         
 Hollywater acting as boundary. On     
 Conford Moor a strip of 20 hectares   
 either side of the stream for half a  
 mile is a Site of Special Scientific  
 Interest. The moorland banks,typically
 acid, give rise to bog vegetation,    
 plants tolerant of acid and lime      
 hating. But water feeding the area is 
 alkaline and so fen vegetation, with  
 lime loving and lime tolerant plants  
 exists alongside the bog vegetation.  
 For reasons yet unknown the water     
 level has fallen in recent years.     
 On Passfield Common,  once grazed,    
 birch is being cut for broom          
 handles. Plans are afoot to restore   
 Hollywater Pond which dried out after 
 its dam burst. The National Trust look
 to voluntary help by young people.    </content>
