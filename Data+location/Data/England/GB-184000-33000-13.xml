		<content> For this and other reasons ,industry  
 in the region is very small.          
 As this area is one of outstanding    
 beauty,it has attracted mainly rich   
 people,many of whom have reached      
 retirement age.                       
 Many people who live on the council   
 estate in the St.Mawes area are       
 employed in the tourist industry on a 
 part time basis or as seasonal        
 workers.The tourist industry would not
 survive without these workers and they
 would find it difficult without the   
 tourist trade.                        
 Seasonal work provides work           
 opportunities for chambermaids,kitchen
 staff,chefs,porters,receptionists,    
 barstaff,waiters and waitresses,shop  
 assistants and many others.           
 There are a small number of people who
 are employed full time in the area.
