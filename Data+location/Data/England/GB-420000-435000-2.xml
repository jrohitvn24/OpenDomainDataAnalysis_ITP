		<title>02A DAY AT NEWLAITHES SCHOOL</title>
		<content> Wake up, get up and clean my teeth -  
 downstairs for breakfast.  Fill my bag
 with homework and things and walk to  
 school.  In the playground play       
 football and wait for bell.  Usually  
 Maths first or finishing projects -   
 assembly at 10.15. The headmaster     
 reads a story and we sing a hymn -    
 different children play instruments   
 they are learning as we go out. Next  
 playtime - mostly football.  After its
 tests on tables or maths and sometimes
 current affairs. At lunchtime we line 
 up with our trays - we choose from a  
 menu and then it's playtime again.    
 Afternoon school might start with     
 Music Workshop, a BBC radio programme.
 One afternoon we do science and we do 
 work on the computer. After play we   
 may listen to talks about hobbies or  
 we may do some art. 3.45 - it's home  
 time. Often we have clubs to stay for.</content>
