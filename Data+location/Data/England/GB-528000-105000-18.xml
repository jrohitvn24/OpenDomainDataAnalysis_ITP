		<title>18A Day in the Life</title>
		<content> It is 7.30 am, time to get up for     
 school. I walk into the kitchen of our
 house in Surrenden Road. Wearily I    
 pour some Shreddies into my cereal    
 bowl and add some skimmed milk.       
 Then after getting ready, I start the 
 short walk to school at 8.30 which is 
 roughly a 1,000 metres, meeting       
 friends on the way. When I arrive at  
 school, I go straight to my classroom 
 and attend registration, when we have 
 some extra time before lessons start. 
 The first three lessons of French,    
 Latin and Music quickly pass and      
 breaktime starts at 11.00am. The next 
 two lessons pass slowly and an hour's 
 lunchbreak starts at 12.30pm. At 1.30 
 lessons are resumed and I half        
 heaatedly rush to art.                
 When I finish school I go to Brighton 
 seafront. I spend 50p on a few arcade 
 machines and a currant bun.           </content>
