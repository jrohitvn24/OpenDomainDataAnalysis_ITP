		<content> In{Hide-and-seek}a seeker is chosen   
 to guard the "den",close his eyes and 
 count to 100 while the others hide.If 
 he finds all the hiders and gets back 
 to the den before them,he becomes the 
 hider,while the first person caught is
 the new seeker.Should a hider get to  
 the den first,he can release all the  
 captured hiders by shouting "One,two, 
 three,buzz off".They all buzz off to  
 find new hiding places while the same 
 seeker re-starts the game.            
 In{Dodge-ball}one person tries to     
 eliminate the others from the game by 
 hitting them below the knee with a    
 football.The thrower cannot run with  
 the ball but the others can run to    
 dodge it.The winner is the last person
 left dodging the ball.He becomes      
 thrower in the next game.
