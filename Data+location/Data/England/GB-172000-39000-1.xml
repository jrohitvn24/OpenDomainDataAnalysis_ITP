		<content> The village of Carharrack in the      
 Parish of Gwennap is found in what was
 once referred to as the "richest      
 square mile on earth." It was so      
 called because of its wealth taken    
 from the{mining}of tin and copper.    
  Today the area is littered with the  
 remnants of this long gone era. There 
 are many ruined pumping engines and   
 chimneys, spoil heaps and dangers from
 many old mine shafts (many of them    
 unmapped.)                            
  The area known as United Downs is now
 entering a period of hoped for        
 prosperity with a major land{         
{reclamation}scheme. Hundreds of new   
 trees have been planted and the land  
 developed to be used as small{        
{industrial}units.                     
  Much of the surrounding area is      
 farmland,with the{farms}used mainly   
  for the grazing of cattle.           </content>
