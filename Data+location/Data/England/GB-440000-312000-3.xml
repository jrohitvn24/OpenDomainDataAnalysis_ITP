		<title>03Amenities in Coalville:</title>
		<content>{  Coalville}is in a state of change.  
 Corner Shops have closed but super-   
 markets, such as Kwik Save, Co-op     
 Superstore and Fine Fair have opened. 
 The open-air market has been replaced 
 by a Covered Market Hall, which opens 
 every Tuesday, Friday and Saturday,   
 supplements the grand{Broadway        
{Shopping Centre.                      
   This change is also apparent in the 
 Leisure facilities available. The     
 three cinemas have closed, the Casino 
 became a Bingo Hall, the Grand is now 
 a Discotheque while the Rex stands    
 empty. The Swimming Pool has closed,to
 be replaced by some Old Peoples Flats.
   Many of the open spaces, such as the
 allotments and parks, have been built 
 upon. A new library was built in      
 1979, containing{58,812}books. However
 the Greyhound Stadium still operates  
 on Tuesdays and Fridays.              </content>
