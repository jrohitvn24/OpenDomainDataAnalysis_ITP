 There is great concern  in the        
 village about the safety of school    
 children as they go to and from       
 school.There is no pavement outside   
 school and no warning to traffic.A    
 decision to find a solution will be   
 made on June 11th 1985.The delay has  
 partly been caused by concern over    
 the{nightingales}who breed in trees   
 which  grow on the section of land    
 proposed to be used to widen the      
 road.Nature Conservationists are      
 worried about this and have protested 
 to the council,also the Clay Cutters  
 Arms which depends on through traffic 
 for trade will lose business if the   
 road is closed.                       </content>
