		<content> There are more houses in the north-   
 ern part of Greetland than in the     
 southern.  The main residential area  
 is between Rochdale Road and Briscoe  
 Lane, which were built in the late    
 19th century. The more recently built 
 houses were built between 1960 and    
 1980 which are High Meadows, Trenance 
 Gardens and Daleside.  The houses     
 around Sunnybank Road were built just 
 before the war.                       
 Out of the 623 houses we charted 42.3%
 were terrace houses; 41.7% are semi   
 detached. Out of the houses we charted
 terrace housing was the most common   
 closely followed by semi-detached     
 houses.  There were no flats or tower 
 blocks.
