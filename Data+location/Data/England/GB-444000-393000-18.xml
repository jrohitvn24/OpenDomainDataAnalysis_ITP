		<title>18FAVOURITE SPORTS</title>
		<content> We learnt about the{sports}that       
 children like in{our school.}The      
{favourite sport}we like is{swimming.  
 Fifty five children like the sport.   
 The{least popular}ones are matball and
 rugby. Only one person likes the best.
{Football}surprised us when it came    
 second. We thought it would have come 
 first because it is a popular sport.  
 There were{thirteen sports}and we made
 graphs and pie charts. Class one chose
 six sports.{Swimming}was the{most     
{popular.}In Class two swimming was,   
 yet again, most popular, but football 
 and tennis came second, not last. In  
 Class three swimming was the          
 favourite.{Ice Skating}and{football}  
 came second. In Class four more than  
 half of the class like swimming. Four 
 children share snooker and roller     
 skating.{Athletics}comes{third.}Darren
 and I like snooker and tennis.        </content>
