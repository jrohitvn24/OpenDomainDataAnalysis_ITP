		<content>                                       
   On Monday we visited the{Territorial
{Army}Centre. When we got there the    
{Sergeant Major}took us up to his room.
 He told us that you must be seventeen 
 and a half years old before you can   
 join the T.A. The youngest soldier is 
 just this age and the oldest is fifty 
 four.(He must retire at fifty five.)  
   At the Centre there are three{rifle 
{platoons}and one{mortar platoon.}There
 are thirty men in a platoon.          
   When training they often go on a    
 twenty two mile run with full gear.   
 They train at weekends and, once a    
 year, they go on a summer camp which  
 may be abroad.                        
   The T.A. has two mottoes.           
                                       
      {MANU FORTE}_ God Willing.       
      {CEDE NULLIS}_ Yield to None.
