		<content>  {Bowcombe Farm}is one of two farms   
 owned in partnership by two brothers, 
 comprising about 1250 acres, of which 
 about half is in Bowcombe. A record of
 a farm at Bowcombe can be found in the
 original{Domesday Book.}The acreage is
 almost equally divided between arable 
 land and cultivated grassland to      
 support 1000 sheep and 450 cattle. The
 arable land is divided between Spring 
 and Winter crops such as barley and   
 wheat. Beans and peas are also grown, 
 as is grass for pasturage and silage  
 for Winter feed.                      
  {While fifty years ago 30 to 40 men  
{were needed to work this acreage, with
{modern machinery and farming          
{techniques only 6 full time workers   
{are employed.}Major seasonal tasks    
 such as hay-making and sheep shearing 
 may be done by contract to speciallist
 agricultural firms.                   </content>
