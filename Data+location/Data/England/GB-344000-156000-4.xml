  We walked across the busy road in    
 partners to the Garage. Mr.Tout was   
 happy to stop his work on a car to let
 us ask some questions. He had owned it
 for the last 7 years and now he does  
 M.O.T. testing, repairing, servicing, 
 car hiring and selling as well as     
 filling cars with petrol. On the large
 forecourt there is what looks like a  
 huge umbrella, under which three      
 pumps operate. He sells about 200     
 gallons a day and his 6 tanks hold    
 9,000 gallons underground. He serves  
 about 50 customers a day and 2 men    
 work for him.  On the front of the    
 building he has lots of safety signs  
 like "No Smoking" and "Switch Off     
 Engine". The price of 4 Star petrol is
 Â£1.99 per gallon and this is what he  
 sells the most.  He also has a  shop  
 for selling sweets and accessories.   </content>
