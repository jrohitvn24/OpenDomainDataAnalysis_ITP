  The Post Office used to be under the 
 bridge.It is now in Barnham Square.   
 This means that it is not so far to   
 walk.                                 
  Mrs Barsby can think of only one     
 adverse change in Barnham: the bus    
 service which used to be very good has
 now almost completely disappeared.    
  There used to be only a few houses   
 along the main Barnham Road but the   
 new estate in the north of the area   
 has greatly increased the population. 
  A large grocer's shop has taken over 
 from the "fish and chip shop". This   
 shop extends from the "Chinese shop"  
 to the estate agent.                  
  Mrs Barsby enjoys living in Barnham. 
 She thinks that the changes that have 
 been made are for the better.
