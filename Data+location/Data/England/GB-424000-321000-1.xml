		<title>01About Our Block</title>
		<content>     Our block contains much of the    
town of Burton upon Trent, including   
its commercial centre, together with   
large areas of industrial and          
residential land.                      
     Burton is a small town (pop.      
50,000) with its roots in the brewing  
industry.   Today only Allied Breweries
and Bass, together with three smaller  
breweries, represent this traditional  
industry in a town where once existed  
many brewing establishments.   Other   
industries present include tyre        
manufacture, metal castings, light and 
heavy engineering and timber products. 
     In the recently constructed       
shopping precinct most major chain     
stores are represented, and there is   
discussion of further expansion.       
     This is a historic year for the   
town, with the completion of the       
long-awaited second river crossing.    </content>
