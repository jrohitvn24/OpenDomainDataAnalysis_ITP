    Law and order in our area is       
 maintained by the Kent County         
 Constabulary, in which Rebecca's      
 father is employed as a police        
 sergeant. He has been in the force for
 seventeen years. He has had experience
 of other work, in the merchant navy   
 and as a sales manager. Most of his   
 work is routine, though the unexpected
 can happen and he has to be ready for 
 it. The worst crime he helped         
 investigate was murder: one man shot  
 another while stealing some money. The
 crime in which most people were       
 involved was a fraud case, involving  
 the arrest of thirty-two people. In   
 his present work, he will have the    
 option of retiring at the age of      
 fifty-five. If he passes the          
 Inspector's exam he will retire at    
 sixty.                                </content>
