{ }We did not have enough information  
 on Kenton's buildings so we did a     
 survey Kenton is a small but expanding
 village,there are 365 buildings and   
 1,100 to 1,200 people.Since 1983      
 Kenton's buildings have increaced by  
 20%, but since 1971 it has increaced  
 by 45%.Although Kenton is expanding   
 27% of buildings are over 100 years   
 old,most of these are on the main A379
 through the centre of the village.The 
 biggest style of houses is detached,  
 30% next was semi detached with 23%   
 bungalows were next with 18%, then    
 next were terraces with 15%.There are 
 very few flats,only 1%.For an old     
 village there are only 6% thatched    
 cottages,and only 0.5% non_thatched   
 cottages.
