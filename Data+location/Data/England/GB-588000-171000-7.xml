		<content>    At Brownies in the summer you go   
 away for a week. You might go         
 bell-ringing or visit the farm. Then  
 you go swimming or go to the woods.   
 You might have a disco or a party or  
 go to play in the park. Then you go   
 home.                                 
    At an ordinary Brownie meeting you 
 might sing some songs like 'Picture a 
 Cowboy' or play a game like 'Traffic  
 Lights' or 'Witches'.                 
    You play 'Traffic Lights' like     
 this. If someone says 'Red' you have  
 to sit down. If someone says 'Amber'  
 you have to stand still, and if       
 'Green' is said you have to run round,
 and the last one to do it is out.     
    If I go to Brownies I enjoy myself.
