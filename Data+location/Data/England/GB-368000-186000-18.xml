		<content>{Some local people}have described what 
 the village was like when they were   
 children, that is to say between the 2
 World Wars.                           
{They came to school}when they were 4  
 years old and stayed at the village   
 school until they were 14 when they   
 went out to work. They were often     
 allowed to play in the road because   
 there was not so much traffic.        
{They can remember going to fairs and  
{fetes}held in the gardens of the old  
 vicarage and Rangeworthy Court.       
 Steeplechases were held in the fields 
 nearby.                               
{In World War 2,}35 bombs hit          
 Rangeworthy. They were probably       
 dropped by German aircraft after      
 returning from bombing Filton or they 
 may have been from aircraft sent to   
 bomb factories at Yate.
