		<content> In our block there is a modern housing
 estate where most of the children in  
 our school live. These houses are     
 detached, semi-detached and terraced  
 2, 3 or 4 bedroomed. On the country   
 road we saw what looked like one big  
 long bungalow but it was't it was 3   
 bungalows joined together with a shed 
 joined with a cable. In the country   
 there are mostly old cottages with    
 small leaded windows. Along the road  
 we saw about 3 farms with pretty farm 
 cottages. At Woolton Hill there is a  
 small estate which has mostly modern  
 houses but a few old houses. In       
 Woolton Hill it is mostly countryside 
 with a few farms. The prices of houses
 in the area are quite high. A four    
 bedroomed detached house with two     
 garages is about Â£82,000. There are   
 quite a few houses on the market.
