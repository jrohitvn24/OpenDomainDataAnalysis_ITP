		<title>10THE MILK INDUSTRY</title>
		<content>  The changes in the{milk industry}    
 arose when the "fitness phase" began. 
 More skimmed milk is being sold and   
 more people are looking for perfect   
 slim and slender bodies.              
{ Green Top}milk contains fat and      
 bacteria therefore many people have   
 changed to skimmed milk.{Skimmed}milk,
 however, contains no fat or bacteria. 
{ Hildale Dairies}produces 70,000 pints
 of milk each day. The best selling    
 milk in the dairy is{pasturised.}Green
 Top milk is vanishing rapidly.        
  Hildale Dairy was started by 14      
 farmers who wanted a place to         
 pasturise their milk in one place. The
 dairy has grown rapidly, and now sells
 its own products to most of West      
 Yorkshire.
