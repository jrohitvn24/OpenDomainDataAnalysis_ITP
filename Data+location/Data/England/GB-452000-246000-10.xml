		<content>ROBERT CANAWAY AGED IO REPORTS ON A    
SHARED DAY WITH HIS FATHER PC CANAWAY. 
After leaving the Police House on the  
ouskirts of the village,the first visit
of the day was to check on the local   
Post Office before driving to Chipping 
Warden School.The purpose of the visit 
to the school was to repeat and stress 
advice about Road Safety following a   
local accident involving a child.      
     After a visit to Towcester to     
check the police car we proceeded to   
Daventry Police Station.My dad took me 
round the cells.Each cell had a wooden 
flimsy looking bench.There was only one
window to let light in.The doors were  
steel and about 8cm thick,(I've decided
I'm going to be good for the rest of my
life.) We had a snack in the canteen,  
and patrolled local villages.I met the 
superintendant in charge of the        
station.                               </content>
