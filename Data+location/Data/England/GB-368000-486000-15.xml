		<title>15Birds Found In Dentdale</title>
		<content>   Ornithology is a hobby many folk in 
 Dentdale enjoy perhaps because there  
 are so many interesting birds to be   
 found here.                           
   What could be more pleasant than    
 a walk along the river? You would be  
 sure to spot a Dipper bobbing up and  
 down on a rock, if you are lucky you  
 may see a Kingfisher dart,showing a   
 flash of blue,as it dives for a       
 fish,or even a Heron standing like a  
 statue.                               
    When walking the fells Peregrine   
 Falcons will be keeping an eye on you 
 from their eyrie as they get ready to 
 hunt for smaller creatures to eat,    
 Buzzards will be on the look out too. 
    Locals delight in seeing Robins,   
 Swallows,Yellowhammers,House Martins, 
 Finches,Wrens Blackbirds,Wagtails     
 and many other birds in their gardens.
