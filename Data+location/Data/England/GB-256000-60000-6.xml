		<title>06LEE MOOR-RETIRED POPULATION.</title>
		<content> The population of Lee Moor has an     
 above average retired population.This 
 does present problems because of the  
 relative isolation of Lee Moor        
 village.For instance, the nearest     
 doctor's surgery is in Wotter.If      
 dental treatment is needed the people 
 have to travel about five miles to    
 Plympton.The nearest hospital is in   
 Plymouth.There are two types of       
 transport available.Some have access  
 to a car,or there is a bus service.   
 There is a shop in the village which  
 sells food but it is only open in the 
 morning and does not have the         
 selection of a supermarket.If people  
 want a wider selection of goods,they  
 either have to travel to Plympton,or  
 rely on a friend or relative to get it
 for them.There are a variety of clubs 
 in the village which bring the older  
 people together.                      </content>
