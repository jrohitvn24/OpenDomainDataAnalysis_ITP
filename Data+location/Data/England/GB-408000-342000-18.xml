		<content>We went to interview a gentleman who   
haslived in this area all his life and 
he has a very broad Staffordshire      
accent.                                
 When we got there he said:            
"I donna raelly know owt start"        
(I don't really know how to start)     
 We asked him what he had been doing,he
said:                                  
"I've bin up failed,lukt sheap"        
(I've been up the field to look at the 
sheep)                                 
 We said we found it difficult to      
understand broad Staffordshire and he  
said:                                  
"They doesna cum from rownd ear"       
(You do not come from round here)      
"When toe ol farmers get tawlking they 
cosna tell what they sae"              
(When two old farmers get talking you  
cannot tell what they say)             
                                       </content>
