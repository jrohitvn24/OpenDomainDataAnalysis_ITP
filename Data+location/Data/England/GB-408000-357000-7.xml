		<title>07Ecton Copper Mines</title>
		<content>     Ecton copper mines were owned by  
the Duke of Devonshire.  In the        
seventeenth century these mines were   
the first in the country to use        
gunpowder.  In the eighteenth century  
they were the deepest mines in the     
country eventually reaching a depth of 
170 fathoms (about 1020 feet).  These  
mines were also the first in the Peak  
District to use wagons for conveying   
ore.  Another method of transport      
underground was to use boats on a      
river, 200 feet below the River        
Manifold.  The ore was taken away on   
the Manifold Light Railway.            
                                       
     Part of the mine is now used to   
grow mushrooms.                        
                                       
     Today, some people are involved   
in preparing a study centre based on   
the mines at Ecton Castle.             </content>
