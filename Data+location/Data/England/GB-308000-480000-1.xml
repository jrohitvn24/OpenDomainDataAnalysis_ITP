		<title>01Coastal Strip N Of Silecroft</title>
		<content> The designated area is mostly sea &amp;   
 includes the shore north of Silecroft.
 Quarter of a mile of sand at low tide,
 then a shingle beach backed by low    
 cliffs.   The cliffs are continually  
 washing down onto the beach, and      
 farmers have to re-site boundary      
 fences frequently, to prevent animals 
 straying.   The fields on the coastal 
 plain are generally stocked with      
 cattle and sheep, but on some barley  
 and turnips are grown in rotation.    
 In 1985 because of very heavy &amp;       
 continuous rainfall, very little hay  
 was taken in.   Summerhill is         
 occupied, but new buildings lived in  
 up to 1940, are now cattle shelters.  
 The west Cumbria railway (NE square)  
 is still in use &amp; power lines         
 parrallel the railway line.   A wholly
 agricultural area.
