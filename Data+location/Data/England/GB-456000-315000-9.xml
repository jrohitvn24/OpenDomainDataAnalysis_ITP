		<content> Leicestershire County Council gave    
 approval (by one vote) to British     
 Gypsum's plan for a{mine and factory  
 at Barrow upon Soar. It is thought it 
 will create five hundred and sixty new
 jobs. The scheme will take up one     
 hundred and thirty three acres and is 
 the second largest project plan       
 Leicester County Council have dealt   
 with. The biggest was their approval  
 of the plan to mine coal in the Vale  
 of Belvoir. The County Council        
 Conservatives were against the plan.  
 The Chairperson of the Environment    
 Committee said that it would attract  
 more traffic to the area and on       
 environmental reasons should be       
 rejected. The Alliance and Labour     
 joined forces to pass the plan. The   
 plan has now been sent to the         
 Environment Secretary for his         
 approval.                {JULIAN HILLS</content>
