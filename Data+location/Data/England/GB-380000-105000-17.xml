		<content> Most houses are owned by the farmers. 
 Tenants are not necessarily           
 farm_workers. Three houses are        
 owner_occupied.                       
 The three farms, Hedge End. New Barn  
 and North Barn all have tied_housing. 
 Two fairly large stone houses have    
 been recently built on Hedge End land.
 One cottage is used only at weekends. 
                                       
 Population:_ 47.                      
                                       
 Life in Turnworth is comparatively    
 peaceful; everyone is known to the    
 others; good_neighbourliness          
 flourishes. The small group of        
 children of all ages, play well       
 together. Village parties are held eg.
 Bonfire Night, barbecues, tractor     
 rides round the village, fund_raising 
 events for the church, where services 
 are held twice a month.               </content>
