		<content> There are 24 children at the school   
 but 7 of the children have brothers or
 sisters who are also at school.       
 There are therefore 17 families.   One
 family has one child, two families    
 have three children, one family has   
 five children and thirteen families   
 have two children.   Most of the other
 children are either already at school 
 or have left school.                  
 Nine families live close enough to    
 walk to school, four live within 3 km 
 of school and four live more than 3 km
 from school.   Eight families travel  
 to school by car.                     
 Two families have only one parent.    
 One child is adopted and one is       
 fostered.                             
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
