		<content> We have our own little shop, called   
 Bowden Antiques.  It is open on       
 Mondays, Tuesdays and Fridays, but we 
 seem to do better on closed days.     
 Thursdays are normally auction days.  
 On Saturdays we sometimes go to       
 Peacocks', another auction place.  We 
 sell antiques mostly at antiques      
 fairs.  At auctions you are really    
 either very pleased with what you've  
 sold or very disappointed.  {Cheryl

 Mummy and Tony own a video shop in    
 Hitchin.  Each morning they leave home
 at 8.45 so that they can arrive by 10.
 They stay till 8 pm daily but Sundays 
 only till 4 pm.  They order and buy   
 new films.  They work very hard       
 especially when they have to look     
 after us as well.{Samantha Field (9)
