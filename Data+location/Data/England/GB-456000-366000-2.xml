		<content>  The church of S.S.Peter and Paul in  
 the North West of the block occupies  
 a good position being built on a hill 
 to the north of the river overlooking 
 the town.It is probably built on the  
 foundations of an earlier wooden Saxon
 church,none of which remains.The      
 church today shows much Norman        
 architecture,in particular a large    
 dog-tooth archway at the base of the  
 tower,but over the years the church   
 has been restored and parts rebuilt.It
 has some lovely stained glass windows 
 and a wooden roof.It has also an angel
 holding a candle which was carved by a
 German prisoner of war.               
    On the outside of the building many
 gargoyles can be seen.A graveyard     
 surrounds the church and the oldest   
 gravestone is dated 1642.
