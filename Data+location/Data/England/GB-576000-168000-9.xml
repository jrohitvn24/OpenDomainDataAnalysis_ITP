		<title>09Armed services in Gillingham</title>
		<content> Gillingham has had a long traditional 
 contact with the armed forces but in  
 1984 the Naval Dockyard closed and    
 much of the barracks have closed in   
 the past few years.                   
 Today the only things left at the     
 Dockyard by the Navy is the ropery, a 
 few warehouses and the cranes. Few    
 R.N. ships come in now, the last ship 
 to leave was HMS Hermione. There are  
 quite a few regiments at Brompton     
 Barracks such as the Royal Marines    
 Reserve, The Ghurkas and the Royal    
 Engineers. You often see them jogging 
 along the road in full kit. Once a    
 year they let people walk round the   
 barracks. The Royal Marines also have 
 a band and play on special occasions. 
 The Royal Engineers construct very    
 strong bridges in a very short time,  
 they are a very elite force.
