		<title>09The Churches of Weston</title>
		<content> The Church of St Mary the Virgin dates
 from the 11th Century or earlier.  At 
 the instigation of the Norreys Bertie 
 family, a new church was built on the 
 site of the previous nave in 1742 and 
 this was in turn extensively restored 
 in the 19th Century. Â£3000 was raised 
 this century to repair the organ.  The
 church has many interesting features  
 including a 12th Century font, an iron
 cross from a ship in the Spanish Arma-
 da and an altar painting attributed to
 Bettoni.  Many tombstones in the well 
 kept churchyard bear witness to the   
 longevity of previous parishioners.   
                                       
 Weston Methodist Chapel is one of the 
 oldest in the area. It was built circa
 1834 by community effort on one of the
 last plots of freehold land remaining 
 after Enclosure. It was extended in   
 the 1930s and again in the 1970s.     </content>
