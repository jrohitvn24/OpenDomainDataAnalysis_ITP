		<content> houses go on and off and the curtains 
 start to be drawn.                    
 The birds start to settle down and    
 people start to come out of the pub.  
 The last orders were called.  A few   
 cars went up and down the roads and it
 went quite silent.  After everybody   
 was out of the pub the lights went off
 and it was locked up.  You could hear 
 milk bottles being put out on the     
 doorstep waiting for the milkman to   
 begin a new day.
