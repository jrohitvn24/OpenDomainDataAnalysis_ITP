		<content> Until l978, when a teacher, 2         
 carpenters, an accountant, a market - 
 gardener, 2 school boys started       
 dancing, there was no known tradition 
 of Morris dancing here. The side,     
 earing white shirts, knee length      
 socks, black breeches and red, yellow 
 and blue baldricks, dance to authentic
 tunes played by an accordianist (a    
 plumber) and l2 yr. old drummer.  With
 bells buckled to their legs they dance
 Cotswold and Border Morris to tunes   
 such as{Shepherds Hey}and{Fanny Frail.
 l3 dancers now practice each Friday   
 night at Bretforton's Fleece Inn and  
 elect their own Squire, Foreman and   
 Bagman. On May lst they gather on     
 Pebworth Rise to dance at sunrise,    
 then dance round the parish to bring  
 fertility for the coming year.
