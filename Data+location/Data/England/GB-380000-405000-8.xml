		<title>08BESSES O' TH' BARN BAND.</title>
		<content>  This famous band started out as      
 "Clegg's Reed Band", formed by the    
 Clegg brothers, who were local cotton 
 manufacturers, in 1818.               
 The present conductor of the band is  
 Roy Newsome. He has led them to many  
 contest wins, such as North West Area 
 Champions in 1979 and 1981, and       
 British Open Champions in 1982.       
 Apart from contests the band also does
 many concerts all over the country and
 has even travelled to Holland,        
 Germany, and Switzerland to perform.  
 They have performed many times on both
 Radio and T.V. and made several       
 records.                              
 The band's practice room for many     
 years has been in a very cramped      
 building at the top of Moss Lane,     
 Whitefield. The original band,        
 however, practiced in the Besses o'   
 th' Barn Inn.                         </content>
