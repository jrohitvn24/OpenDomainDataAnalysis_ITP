		<title>20THE SANDLINGS, TOURISM</title>
		<content> The Sandlings is a spacious area of   
 great beauty and variety. The Forestry
 Commission have a caravan and camping 
 site at Tangham near Butley, ideal for
 families who enjoy the pleasure of ob-
 serving the forest's wildlife at first
 hand. It is remote from holiday crowds
 yet near the Suffolk Heritage Coast.  
 Planes from the nearby airbases can,  
 at times, disturb this tranquility.   
 Suffolk Coastal District Council have 
 built two picnic sites at Hollesley   
 Common on the C340 road and a circular
 nature trail is planned linking the   
 amenity areas. Members of the Youth   
 Training Scheme have built a pond by  
 an underground stream and a hide. This
 is on a deer run and Roe, Muntjac, and
 Fallow deer may be seen at the right  
 time. This is popular with visitors   
 and 6000 cars visited the site this   
 year.                                 </content>
