		<title>01THE MEYSEY HAMPTON AREA</title>
		<content>  Our block lies to the west of the    
 village of Meysey Hampton in the      
 eastern Cotswolds, about half way     
 between Cirencester and Fairford. Most
 of the land is farming land, mainly   
 arable and grassland.                 
  There are two villages lying mostly  
 in our block: Meysey Hampton and      
 Poulton. The houses are built of      
 Cotswold stone and there are many     
 Cotswold stone walls round the fields.
  There is an iron age site at Ranbury 
 Rings but it is not open to the       
 public because there are no footpaths 
 to it.                                
  The nearest big town is Swindon which
 is 16 miles away. Many people in our  
 area travel to work there and some    
 even travel by train from Swindon to  
 work in London.
