		<content> FARMING                               
  The main activity in this area is    
 farming and it obviously forms the    
 major form of employment.There were   
 few farmworkers' homes in the area and
 to-day many of those living in        
 cottages  seemed                      
 to be commuters, working in Bristol,  
 Bath,or Chippenham. The farm workers  
 presumably live in villages nearby,   
 such as Pucklechurch which provide    
 more readily accessible services for  
 those on lower incomes.               
  Farming seemed prosperous, buildings 
 modernised and enlarged, outbuildings 
 large and spacious. Farm machinery was
 evident, both in use as hay balers, or
 housed under cover  from the wet June 
 weather.The willingness of farmers to 
 give up their time to talk about their
 lives seems evidence that they are    
 happy with their lot.                 </content>
