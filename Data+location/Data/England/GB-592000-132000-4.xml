		<title>04Woodchurch Parish Church</title>
		<content> The present Woodchurch church was     
 built in 13th century.  It is a strong
 stone construction which possibly     
 replaced a wooden one from Saxon      
 times.  This may be how Woodchurch got
 its name. The subsidence in the clay  
 has forced the{tower}to have large    
 buttresses.{The spire}is 35 metres    
 high and made of wood. {The West door 
 is only used on special occasions     
 (eg.Weddings, Christenings etc.).  The
{porch,}made of stone, was added a     
 century later. It has a Holy Water    
{Stoup}and door that opens onto a      
 spiral staircase leading to the{parvis
 (priest's room). Octagonal and round  
{pillars,}made of Kent ragstone,  are  
 put in the nave to hold up the roof.  
 The{pews,}made from local oak, were   
 added in 1846. Originally people had  
 to stand.  The{pulpit}was altered     
 from three, to a single tier in 1840. </content>
