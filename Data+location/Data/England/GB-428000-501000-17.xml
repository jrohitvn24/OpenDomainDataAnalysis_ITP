		<content> On October 31st, Halloween night,     
 children wear masks and carry         
 lanterns. They knock at doors and ask 
 whether you would like a trick or a   
 treat. A trick is given by the        
 children, a treat by the householder, 
 usually some sweets or money.         
 November 4th is mischief night, gates 
 are taken off and hidden, dustbins    
 moved and various other types of mis- 
 chief is carried out by children.     
 November 5th is Guy Faulks Bonfire    
 night. Village bonfires and firework  
 displays take place.                  
 At country weddings, while the service
 is taking place, children tie up the  
 church gates. Money must be thrown to 
 them over the gate before it can be   
 opened.                               
 At New Years Eve people visit other   
 houses, the first visitor of the new  
 year is called the 'first foot'.      </content>
