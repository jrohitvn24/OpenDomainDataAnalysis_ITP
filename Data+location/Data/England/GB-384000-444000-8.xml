		<title>08EMPLOYMENT IN BARNOLDSWICK</title>
		<content>  Barnoldswick was once a thriving     
cotton town.Cotton mills employed most 
of the town's work force.As they began 
to close in the 1950's and 60's many   
small firms took over the mills and now
employ many people in various          
industries such as light engingeering, 
printing,fabrics,plastics and filters. 
  The two biggest employers are Rolls  
Royce and Silentnight.In our school a  
lot of the dads work at Rolls Royce    
making parts for R.B.211 Areo Engines. 
R.B.stands for Rolls Barnoldswick.     
  Quite a few mums and dads work at    
Silentnight making beds and mattresses.
At present only about half the factory 
is working as the others are on strike 
over a pay rise.                       
  The unemployment level in            
Barnoldswick is around 15%.
