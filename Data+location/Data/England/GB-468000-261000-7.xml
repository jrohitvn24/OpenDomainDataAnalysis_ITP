Staffing consists of 11 Consultants,   
14 full time Junior Doctors and 12     
part time Doctors. Each night from     
5 - 9 p.m. there is one Consultant     
and three Junior Doctors on duty       
covering three wards and the           
Outpatients' Department. The 350 nurses
are divided into three groups - two for
day duty (8 hours) and one for nights  
(12 hours, three nights a week).       
                                       
The staff have their own sporting and  
recreational facilities. In earlier    
days, the staff had to live on the     
wards with the patients.
