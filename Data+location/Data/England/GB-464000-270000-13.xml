		<title>13Ravensthorpe Wool Festival</title>
		<content>Ravensthorpe decided to have a festival
in June 1982 as a social event and to  
raise money for social amenities.With  
rural life in mind,a theme of 'wool'   
was chosen.Various craftsmen and crafts
women demonstrated their skills and    
wares in gardens around the village.Our
main event was making the Althorpe Coat
We would try to make a replica of the  
Throckmorton Coat of 1811,duplicating  
the conditions of sheep shearing,wool  
spinning,washing and drying the cloth &amp;
cutting and sewing the coat in less    
than the original time of 13 hours 20  
minutes.The shearer took just 4 minutes
to shear each of the 17 Jacobs sheep.  
From the spinners the wool was handed  
to weavers,carders,teasers and tailors 
30 in all.A large crowd gathered to see
it made with only 12 minutes to spare. 
The coat was then worn by Viscount     
Althorpe,a successful weekend.         </content>
