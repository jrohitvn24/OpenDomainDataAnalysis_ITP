		<title>02Highworth's Ghosts.</title>
		<content>     {Highworth}has many ghosts, the   
 following have been seen by various   
 people of{Highworth.                  
     {The King &amp; Queen Inn.} The ghost 
 of the{King and Queen}is a{13th.      
{century monk,}which haunts the{600    
{year old pub,}once a{coaching inn}and 
 before that a{court_house.}The        
 landlord was alone, he heard his two  
{Alsatian guard_dogs}start howling.    
 "Quite unlike their normal bark. When 
 I went out they were quite rigid,     
 obviously scared." The ghost was a    
{three dimensional disfigured          
{hunch_backed monk.                    
     {The Ghost of St. Michaels.}It is 
 a shuffling figure that comes up      
{Vicarage Lane. It is a monk,}his head 
 bowed and hands together in prayer.   
 Presumably it is also the ghost that  
 haunts the{King and Queen.
