		<content>  There are buses,taxis,trains,motor   
 bikes,cycles and cars in              
 Sawbridgeworth.We are on the Liverpool
 St.-Cambridge railway route, which is 
 now fully electrified. The main       
 road ,the A1184 is usually busy as    
 Sawbridgeworth is situated between    
 London and Cambridge.This makes       
 several notorious junctions like West 
 Rd.,Station Rd. and London(A1184)Rd.To
 try and help this, two mini           
 roundabouts were recently built at    
 this junction.Sawbridgeworth has      
 three bus stops. The services are     
 National Express main route,Local and 
 village links.The local buses link up 
 with some of the neighbouring         
 villages.Most people in town have, and
 use, cars.Motorbikes and bikes are    
 mostly ridden by younger people who   
 are unable to afford a car.This allows
 them to visit other places.           </content>
