		<content> Occupation of the western part of the 
 block began around 100 years ago with 
 the building of small terraced houses 
 for railway and factory workers &amp; more
 substantial Victorian villas. The area
 owes much to the architect{Arthur     
{Wakerley}(1862-1931) of Crown Hills   
 House. His plan for a parallel town to
 Leicester resulted in the building of 
 a fire station,police station,market  
 hall &amp; square,a Wesley Hall Chapel,The
 Imperial Temperance Hotel,workers     
 houses (Â£299),cottages &amp; workshops for
 the blind,all in the North Evington   
 area. By 1945 much of the central     
 block had been developed with 1930's  
 semis &amp; council housing but large     
 areas of farmland,with a few mansion  
 houses,extended to the east. Today    
 this part of the block is much        
 changed. Centrally many more factories
 have been built.{(continued page 3)   </content>
