		<title>09Old Dalby Quilters</title>
		<content> In 1983 some women in Old Dalby became
 interested in quilt making.The group  
 took hedgerow flowers as their theme  
 for a large quilt.They decided to have
 12 panels with one for each month of  
 the year.Flowers were sketched and    
 then patterns made for each panel.Each
 quilter took a panel.Eleven quilters  
 began but a year later when the quilt 
 was finished there were only 7 left.  
 The completed quilt was 240cm.by      
 243cm.The group decided to raffle the 
 quilt and the money raised was to be  
 shared between Old Dalby Village Hall 
 and the Renal Unit at Leicester.10,000
 tickets were printed and in 6 months  
 9,600 were sold at 25p.each.The winner
 of the raffle was a patient of the    
 Renal Unit and he gave the quilt back 
 to be raffled again in 1985.The       
 Village Hall and the Renal Unit were  
 each given Â£1,050.                    </content>
