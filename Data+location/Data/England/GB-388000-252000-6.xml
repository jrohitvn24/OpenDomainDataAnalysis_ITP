		<content> There is only one local{bus}service,  
 the 350/351,which runs at half hourly 
 intervals on Wednesdays and Saturdays.
 This is operated by the Midland Red   
 West Bus Company and runs from        
 Worcester through Churchill to        
 Redditch.{                            
 The{M5}currently under a              
 reconstruction and road widening      
 scheme, runs from North to South down 
 the west side of our area. There are  
 no interchanges until the parish of   
 Whittington is reached,(Junction 7)   
 The Birmingham to Cheltenham{railway  
{line}runs North to South through our  
 grid. The former GWR Worcester station
 was at Spetchley crossroads and       
 passengers entered Worcester by       
 carriage from the station along       
 Spetchley road. Recent plans to       
 re-establish a station at Spetchley   
 received little support.              </content>
