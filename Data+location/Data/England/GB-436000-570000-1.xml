		<content>Out of the 12 squares which we were    
allocated between Tynemouth and Whitley
Bay,9 of them were the North Sea.The   
land use survey showed us that most of 
the houses were quite old and were     
terraced.There was some modern         
development in Cullercoats             
Village(flats for the old pensioners)  
but not much of the original fishing   
village remains now.The only real links
that Cullercoats now has with the sea  
are the Lifeboat house and the Dove    
Marine Laboratory,which belongs to     
Newcastle University.                  
Employment in this area is no longer in
the fishing industry.The employment    
now takes people either into the city  
centre,Newcastle,or into the amusements
and amenities in the area.The majority 
of people use the highly popular       
Metro.There is little evidence of      
minority cultures in this area.        </content>
