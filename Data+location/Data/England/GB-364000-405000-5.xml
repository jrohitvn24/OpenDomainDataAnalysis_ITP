		<content> A coil weighing 8 tons is loaded onto 
 the{cut up line}and fed through       
 rollers to remove the curvature. It is
{automatically inspected}for thickness 
 and damage.The metal is cut into      
 pieces of specific size,stacked onto  
 wooden boards in quantities weighing  
 between 1 and 2 tons and carried to   
 the{lacquer machine}which coats the   
 upper surface for protection.The      
 sheets are then{baked.}A series of    
 passes through the printing presses   
 builds up the pattern and applies{    
{varnish}.Fine scroll shears then cut  
 the metal into strips and the can ends
 are pressed out.Other sheets are cut  
 by a{slitter.The body maker machine}  
 folds and welds the pieces into       
 cylinders.These progress to the       
{flanger}which flanges both ends.The   
 bottom is attached by a seamer.Cans   
 are tested by air pressure.           </content>
