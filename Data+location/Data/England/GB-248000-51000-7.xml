		<title>07ST MARYS AND ALL SAINTS</title>
		<content>    St Marys and All Saints is a       
 delightful church with a large parish 
 dating back to the time of the old    
{Domesday Book}where it is mentioned as
 PLEMSTOCHA.                           
                                       
   The church tower was built in the   
{15th century}and holds six 18th       
 century bells. St Mary's has many     
 stained glass windows and an          
 impressive Norman font.An enormous    
{pipe organ}thunders into every corner 
 of the building. There are            
 lots of old{graves}in the yard, the   
 oldest dating back to 1761,though the 
 registers date back as far as 1591.   
                                       
 A Roman Catholic church built as      
 recently as 1961 actually has a ship's
 bell to call worshippers to church.As 
 it serves the whole of the Plymstock  
 area it certainly needs to ring loudly</content>
