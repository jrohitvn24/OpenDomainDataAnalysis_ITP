		<title>15Taunton Cider. History.</title>
		<content>   Taunton Cider was established at    
 Norton Fitzwarren in 1911. Before     
 this, the Rev. Cornish had established
 a reputation for the drink at         
 Heathfield Rectory. In 1921 the firm  
 was registered and has since expanded 
 from six workers to over 500.         
   The French grew cider apples in     
 Normandy and used to import them      
 through Weymouth. The need arose to   
 process the apples before delays      
 ruined them and this was achieved by  
 concentrating the juice. Until 25     
 years ago this was used to produce    
 'Nat', a draught cider in wooden casks
 sold within a 70ml. radius of Taunton.
   The pagan custom of 'wassailing' has
 recently been revived at Taunton      
 Cider.  In January a Wassail Queen is 
 carried around a cider apple orchard  
 giving a token gift of toast soaked in
 cider to the robins in the trees.     </content>
