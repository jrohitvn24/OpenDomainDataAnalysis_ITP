		<content> There are first schools in both Sutton
 and Catfield. Sutton First is a modern
 building but Catfield is an old style 
 village school built in 1853. When    
 they are 8 the children transfer to   
 the middle school at Stalham, which is
 about half a mile north of Sutton.    
 Catfield children are taken to Stalham
 by coach. School starts at 8.30 a.m.  
 because the coaches have to return to 
 the villages to pick up the older     
 children and take them to Stalham     
 High. The large modern Middle School  
 takes children from twelve surrounding
 villages within a four mile radius of 
 Stalham. Because of the Middle School,
 children in this block have friends   
 from other villages who can live a    
 long way away. They often cycle to see
 them. When they are 12 years old the  
 children go up the road to Stalham    
 High School.                          </content>
