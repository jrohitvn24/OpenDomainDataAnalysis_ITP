		<content> Chelsfield variously spelt in old     
writings Cheseld,Ciresfel,Chelsfeld    
and Chellesfield took its name from its
cold and open situation,"Celd" in the  
Saxon meaning cold and "Feld" a plain  
or field.                              
 The parish of Chelsfield is quite     
large and in general lies on high land.
It contains about 3378 acres of land   
ands about four and a half miles long  
from south to north but varies from    
east to west.                          
 Chelsfield, itself,has been split into
two parts over the years by the making 
and use of the By-Pass that carries    
traffic to and from Sevenoaks and      
Orpington. The old village of          
Chelsfield still remains surrounded by 
countryside that consists mainly of    
farmland and woodland.The people of    
Chelfield can now reach London from    
either Chelsfield or Knockholt Station.</content>
