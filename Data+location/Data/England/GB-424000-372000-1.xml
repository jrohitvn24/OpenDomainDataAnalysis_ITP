		<content>      The area is situated in the Peak 
 Park, within 20 minutes drive by car  
 from  Chesterfield and Sheffield in   
 the east, and immediately north of the
 Chatsworth Estate.Most of the land,   
 which rises from the River Derwent at 
 310m to the gritstone edges, is       
 pasture land whilst moorland dominates
 most of the highland up to 350m. Some 
 highland is successfully cultivated.  
      The villages began to grow in the
 1960's when they attracted people from
 professions who worked in Sheffield.  
 New families now replace those whose  
 companies require them to move on.    
 Most of the following information has 
 been obtained from the questionnaires 
 answered by children attending both   
 primary schools and their parents, and
 therefore represents the lives of     
 families.
