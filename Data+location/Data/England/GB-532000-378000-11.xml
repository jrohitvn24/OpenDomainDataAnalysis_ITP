		<content>      As the names Burwell and         
 Maidenwell suggest many of the        
 villages in this area were built near 
 sources of fresh water.  The wells and
 springs were used until recent times. 
 In Burwell the spring can still be    
 seen and used, although mains water   
 was put on about 30 years ago.        
 Maidenwell and Ruckland were only     
 connected to the mains this year,     
 probably because of the high nitrate  
 levels in the local water.            
      The youth hostel at Ruckland and 
 the Outdoor Pursuit Centre at         
 Maidenwell still do not have a supply 
 of running water.  Water has to be    
 taken in containers or "carted" from a
 local farm.                           
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
