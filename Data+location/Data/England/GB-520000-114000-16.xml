		<content>   There are many Clubs, Associations  
 and Societies meeting in the Village  
 for both young and old.  There is no  
 need to be bored!                     
       The W. I. by Christine.         
   W. I. stands for the Women's        
 Institute.  It is where all the ladies
 meet up.  They meet on Tuesday either 
 in the Village Hall or at people's    
 homes.  In the Summer they hold the   
 Summer Show.  In 1985 it was the 50th 
 anniversary. The Summer Show is where 
 all the villagers join in competitions
 and there is a prize cup in every     
 section.  Outside there are stalls.   
       Ballet Lessons by Nicole.       
 I have been going to ballet since I   
 was 2.  I enjoy it.  My teacher takes 
 2 to 14 year olds.  I am in the last  
 class but I am only nine.  There is   
 only one person on their points.  I go
 to lessons on Saturdays.              </content>
