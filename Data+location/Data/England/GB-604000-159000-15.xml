		<title>15MY ROAD IN BOUGHTON</title>
		<content>   I looked out of my window and saw   
 the postman cut across the garden.    
 When I came out to play I saw the     
 footprints on the mud. In our road    
 there are some men putting phone wires
 in. There is a park where we play;the 
 boys make goals for football. At night
 you can hear the motorway. Our road is
 noisy with people playing hopscotch,  
 running and jumping. There are about  
 29 houses and lots of children down   
 our road. When people pass they drop  
 litter. My dad never cleans the car,  
 he gives me the job. When mum hangs   
 out her washing, she always starts    
 nattering to my next door neighbour.  
 Down the road there is a great big    
 house with a well looked after garden 
 and a lampost outside.My front garden 
 has a wall, and if you stand on it,   
 you can see a long way off. That's    
 what happens down our road.           </content>
