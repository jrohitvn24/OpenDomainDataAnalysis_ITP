		<title>06WOODFORD FIREWORK FACTORY</title>
		<content>   The only large industry in the      
 village is a factory which            
 manufactures signals and flares for   
 the Army, Navy &amp; Air Force. It is a   
 light industry and women are more     
 suited to assemble the delicate parts 
 of the products. These women change   
 their clothes on arrival and wear     
 everything made from cotton. At the   
 end of the day they have a shower and 
 change back into their own clothes.   
 Many of the workers live in the       
 village , and a private bus brings    
 workers from Salisbury. The products  
 are not dangerous. The flares and     
 coloured signals are used by the      
 Services for training. They can be    
 used as signals or smoke screens      
 during exercises.                     
 . This factory is owned by an         
 American company, but the research    
 work is done in the village factory.  </content>
