		<title>17Our Water in Cheshunt</title>
		<content> We get our water supply from the      
 Thames, the Lee and the New River. The
 water has germs. It is taken with     
 chlorine gas then put in big tanks to 
 be stored then pumped into big pipes  
 and comes through our taps. We have to
 pay a bill twice a year. For a family 
 that is about Â£80 a year. It costs 8p 
 for 1000 gallons. A lot of water is   
 used for having baths or showers and  
 the toilets, and for drinking and for 
 the garden in summer when it hasn't   
 been raining. We asked the inspector  
 how long he worked_ 35 hours a week   
 starting at 7.30 in the morning. The  
 man at the pumping station said that  
 it went for 24 hours a day so someone 
 has to work daytime and somebody at   
 night. The big machines pump the water
 along canals and some are high and go 
 down a sort of waterfall into a lower 
 level. This stops flooding.           </content>
