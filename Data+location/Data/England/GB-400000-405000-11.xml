		<title>11EDUCATION IN SADDLEWORTH</title>
		<content> There were originally small village   
 schools in the area, but now there is 
 only one serving the locality.        
                                       
 In Diggle, there was a school at Kiln 
 Green. In Uppermill the first school  
 dates back to Medieval times, when it 
 was situated in the chancel of the    
 Church.There was a Victorian building 
 in Lee Street, in the Saddleworth Fold
 hamlet (present Church Street). This  
 was the original St. Chad's school,   
 which opened in 1860 &amp; that building  
 was closed in 1883. The school became 
 known as "Saddleworth Parochial", its 
 official name being Saddleworth       
 Parochial (C.E.) Controlled Junior &amp;  
 Infant School, until September, 1985, 
 when it was renamed St. Chad's C.E.   
 Primary School. The present building  
 was constructed in 1961, in Rhodes    
 Avenue, in the new housing estate.    </content>
