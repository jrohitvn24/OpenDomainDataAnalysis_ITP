		<content>   Cople is just off the A603, Bedford 
 to Sandy Road. It has a population of 
 800, many of whom have families  with 
 young children who go to the  popular 
 local school.                         
                                       
   Like many Bedfordshire  villages it 
 is  built  along one main street. But 
 there are a number of houses in Water 
 End which is off the main road. There 
 is a village  store  and  post office 
 which sells local people their  daily 
 food and household needs.             
                                       
   Most of the  working people have to 
 leave the village for Bedford. Sandy, 
 Biggleswade or further afield to find 
 work.  Only a few are employed in the 
 school, garage or local farms.        
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
