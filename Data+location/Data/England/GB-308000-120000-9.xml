		<title>09FETES AND FAIRES</title>
		<content> Every year Langford school has a      
 fete to raise money for the           
 school fund.This year it was held     
 in the playground. Other people have  
 fetes to raise money for chareties or 
 to build a village hall. At the fetes 
 there are many different stalls, such 
 as cake stalls, lucky dips, bottle    
 stalls, and white elephaunt stalls.   
 Also there are many stalls with games 
 where you can win prizes. Ice creams, 
 sweets, and teas can be bought        
 Sometimes there are Competitions and  
 Fancy dress parades you can enter to  
 win more prizes. There is always a    
 raffle, for this you buy a ticket with
 a number on and if that number is     
 drawn out at the end of the day you   
 win something special. Sometimes there
 are rides on  horses or donkeys.      
 Fetes and faires are fun.
