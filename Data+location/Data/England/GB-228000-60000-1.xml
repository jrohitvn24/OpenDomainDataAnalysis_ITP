		<content> Most of the block is agricultural     
 land.  Several farms of small field   
 systems provide grazing pasture for   
 dairy and several flocks of sheep.    
 Like most of south east Cornall the   
 terrain is hilly in nature and well   
 watered by streams and springs.  The  
 dominant residential area is the      
 village of Menheniot.  The population 
 of this village has trebled in the    
 last two decades, and it is mainly a  
 dormitory for Plymouth and Liskeard.  
 This is made convenient by the A38    
 trunk road and the Plymouth/Penzance  
 main line railway passing through the 
 block.
