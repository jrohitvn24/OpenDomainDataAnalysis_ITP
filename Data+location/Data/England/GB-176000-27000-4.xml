		<title>04FARMING IN MAWNAN</title>
		<content> Out of the{13 farms}in Mawnan 2 are   
 owned by the National Trust and 2 by  
 the County Council.3 of the farmers   
 own extensive amounts of land         
 elsewhere.10 out of them are well     
 established family farms.4 of them    
 work the farms by themselves.We       
 interviewed 3 of the farmers the rest 
 were too busy haymaking.They had 800  
 anmimals and 870 acres of land between
 them.They had grassland for silage,   
 barley, wheat, peas, potatoes, dairy  
 cows and beef animals.Some of them    
 believe in knocking down hedges to    
 make the fields bigger for the        
 machines.They all use{pesticides}and  
 sprays.They all own a lot of          
 machinery.To be a good farmer they    
 said you need patience, dedication,   
 tenacity, strength and a 24 hour care 
 for animals.
