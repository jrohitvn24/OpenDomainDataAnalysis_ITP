		<content>  Rehersals for the production begin in
 May. There are 5 island rehersals     
 altogether, with one dress rehersal on
 the island the weekend before the     
 performance. The actors are drawn from
 a variety of backgrounds, though it is
 becoming increasingly difficult to    
 find people willing to donate their   
 free time. A cowshed is used as a     
 changing room and a store room for    
 lighting and effects. The set is a    
 simple composite set, with some arches
 and rostra provided, and the best is  
 made of natural scenery. Costumes come
 from the Royal Shakespeare Hire       
 Wardrobe. Actual stage lighting is    
 used- the most expensive part of the  
 organisation.The actual performance   
 lasts around 3 hours, and it takes    
 nearly 40 minutes to clear the island.
 Refreshments are provided during the  
 half hour interval in a marquee.      </content>
