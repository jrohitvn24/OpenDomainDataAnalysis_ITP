		<content>{Kickit}is a game of football and      
 cricket. We play with a sponge ball.  
 We use the waste paper bin as the     
 wicket. The ball is bowled to you and 
 you have to kick it. The team or      
 person with the highest score wins.   
                                       
 The{football}we play in the playground
 is a bit different from real football.
 We play with a sponge ball. There are 
 not any edges to the pitch except at  
 each goal end. The goals are markings 
 on the playground. When we have picked
 sides the game starts. There is a lot 
 of end to end football and the games  
 are normally high scoring.
