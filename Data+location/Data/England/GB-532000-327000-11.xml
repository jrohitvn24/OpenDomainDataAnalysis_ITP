		<title>11Agriculture at Holbeach Bank</title>
		<content> The land around here is mostly taken  
 up with farmland.A lot of the crops   
 are sold in other parts of the country
 by merchants because they make more   
 money where people cannot grow their  
 own.But some of the crops die of the  
 sharp winter frosts.In spring the     
 whole area is alive with tulips and   
 daffodills.                           
 There are lots of small plots with an 
 average of 10 acres.The biggest farm  
 around here is Tinsley's. They own    
 most of the fields and employ many    
 people in their food processing works.
 Some of the fields around here have   
 strawberries in the summer.The most   
 valuable crops are wheat potatoes and 
 sugar beet.People around here get good
 crops because the land is fertile.    
 Some grow flowers to sell.They go to  
 London, then to all parts of the      
 country.                              </content>
