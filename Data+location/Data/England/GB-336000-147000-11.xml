		<title>11Mark's History</title>
		<content> In old documents{"Mark"}is variously  
 written March (a marsh),Mercon,and    
 Merk (a boundary). In 1348-49,the     
 Black Death swept from Bath and       
 Bristol over most of Somerset and this
 area did not recover until the wool   
 trade,introduced by the Flemings began
 to flourish here,bringing prosperity  
 that enabled the moors to be drained  
 and houses built. The{Pack Horse}is   
 thought to have got its  name from the
 wool packed on to horses from here. It
 was also a Coaching Inn. The Monks of 
 Glastonbury contributed to the upkeep 
 of the{Church}and the villagers had to
 give grain and wool to the Great Tythe
 Barn of the Abbot at Glastonbury.     
{Locksbroad Farm}is said to have been  
 built by the Monks and is certainly   
 very old. Many of the 30 farms in the 
 area are over 100 years old. The      
{Vicarage}is also quite old.           </content>
