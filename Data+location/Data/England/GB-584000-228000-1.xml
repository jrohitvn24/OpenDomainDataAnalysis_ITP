		<content> Our survey area,in North West Essex   
 has two villages in it, Earls Colne   
 and Colne Engaine. Earls Colne is the 
 larger of the two, while Colne Engaine
 is the smaller.                       
 The countryside contains rolling      
 areas, mainly farmland. The housing   
 ranges from modern day dwellings, way 
 back to Elizabethan style cottages.   
 There is not much woodland in our     
 area, except for a small part of      
 Chalkney Woods down in the South      
 East corner.                          
   The farmland areas contain non grass
 crops and grass crops. Other farming  
 areas include crops for King Seeds in 
 Coggeshall. Small clumps of trees are 
 scattered out around the survey grid, 
 with a wide range of names.           
   Our area is generally country side, 
 apart from the two villages, Earls    
 Colne and Colne Engaine.              </content>
