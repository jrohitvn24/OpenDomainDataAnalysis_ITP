		<content> In a survey of the children in        
 Midsomer Norton, it was found that the
 most popular game played at school was
 football followed by rounders and     
 other ball games. At home, the most   
 popular game was tennis, which is     
 mainly played in the road or in       
 gardens, or sometimes at the courts of
 the local secondary school.  One      
 interesting game that some children   
 play at home is called "Kerby".  To   
 play Kerby you need 2 players, a ball 
 (which can be larg or small) and a    
 place with a kerb on each side of the 
 road.  One player stands on each side 
 of the road and throws the ball at the
 opposite kerb.  If it hits the kerb   
 and bounces back that is a "kerb" (one
 point).  The winner has to get 10     
 kerbs to win.
