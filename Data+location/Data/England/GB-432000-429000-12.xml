		<title>12Stourton: a Dying Community</title>
		<content>                                       
      The{village}was once a           
 close-knit, self-contained{community  
 of about 2,500 people with its        
 schools, library, park, chapels,      
 church and shops, until it was        
 demolished.                           
      The former Stourtoners held their
 reunion in{Stourton Liberal Working   
{Men's Club,}the last building in the  
 village still in use.                 
      There was a nostalgic story to go
 with every drink. One of the          
 favourites was about the day a        
 fully-laden horse and cart disappeared
 into the local pond. It is still there
 to this day.                          
      Mr Peter Gregg, 39, said that the
{demolition}of Stourton had "destroyed 
 a community. The houses may have been 
 bad, but there was a tremendous       
 community spirit".                    </content>
