		<title>09Comparing Pendock to a town</title>
		<content> When you compare Pendock life to town 
 life there is a lot of difference     
 between them.When we go to a town     
 there are lots of fish and chip       
 papers, crisp packets,cigarette       
 packets and plastic containers in the 
 street,not in the litter bins.There   
 are also a lot of cars which create   
 fumes.There are litter bins in towns  
 but people ignore them and throw      
 litter down in the street.            
     In Pendock there are fields and   
 large gardens to play in.There is no  
 litter anywhere, because there is only
 one shop which has a litter bin       
 outside the door, which everybody uses
 for their litter.                     
      Although there is the M.50       
 motorway we do not have enough traffic
 to create any fumes.                  
                                       
                                       </content>
