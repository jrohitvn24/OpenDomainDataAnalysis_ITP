		<content> On Saturday morning I get up at about 
 nine o'clock and make my mum and dad a
 drink and have some toast for my      
 breakfast. I then get dressed and go  
 to town with my mother. On Saturday   
 the town is crowded. We go and come   
 back from town by bus.On returning    
 home I see my brother going off to    
 work at the frozen food centre.After  
 our dinner I watch television which is
 mostly sports programmes. After tea we
 play board and card games until       
 bedtime. On Sunday morning my mum and 
 dad get up first. When I get up I have
 a drink, I stay in my nightdress and  
 play with my dog. Dinner is a family  
 occasion when we usually have a roast 
 meal. During the afternoon I usually  
 watch television or talk to my        
 brothers and parents until it is time 
 to go to bed.
