 Cherry Cottage Nursery in Cow Lane    
 mainly grows house plants for delivery
 to shops. It got its name from a      
 cherry orchard planted in 1900. There 
 are 5 greenhouses taking up 0.75      
 acres. Five people work there         
 including the owner.                  
 The propagating house has electric    
 soil-warming cables and an air        
 heater.Temperatures are kept at 95    
 degrees Fahrenheit. The next house is 
 for pricking out and is kept at 55    
 degrees Fahrenheit.There is a sloping 
 bench so that the workers' arms do not
 get tired. Outside there is about an  
 acre of land for growing pansies and  
 wallflowers.                          
 There is a second nursery near the    
 mill.It grows mainly lettuces and     
 tomatoes.The  owner works from 4a.m.  
 to 10p.m. during the growing season.  </content>
