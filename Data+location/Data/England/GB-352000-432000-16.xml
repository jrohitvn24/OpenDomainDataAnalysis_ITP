		<title>16Motorway Systems - Bypass</title>
		<content> Three distinct areas of motorway and  
 bypass meet at Broughton roundabbout. 
 PRESTON  BYPASS - M6 OPENED 5th Dec   
 1958. The first bit of motorway       
 completed in this country, though the 
 south disagrees.                      
 M55 to BLACKPOOL - OPENED 3rd July    
 1975.                                 
 INGOL DISTRIBUTOR ROAD. Still being   
 built. Sections opened 16th Jan 1984, 
 and 11th June 1984. To be finished    
 June 1986. This bypass has, and is,   
 causing many local arguments over its 
 position, the land it has taken and   
 its use.                              
 In our survey we found the motorway   
 nad bypass to be well used for both   
 leisure activities and work. (Leisure 
 - 93%. Work - 25%). People in the area
 travel to BLACKPOOL, LAKE DISTRICT,   
 SOUTHPORT, BEACON FELL and LANCASTER  
 for a day out.                        </content>
