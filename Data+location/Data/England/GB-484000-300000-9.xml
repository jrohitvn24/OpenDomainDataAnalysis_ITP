 historic market town from East to     
 West.Its length of just under three   
 kilometers cuts through agricultural  
 land used predominantly for cattle    
 grazing.It is a single carriageway    
 road with no barrier down the         
 middle.Half way along there is a      
 roundabout linking an access road into
 Uppingham,the by-pass,and two roads   
 running northwards.
