		<title>06Pastimes for girls in Bacup</title>
		<content> I am a girl. When my friend comes to  
 call we go outside and play tennis.   
 When we are bored we go and get       
 our skates on and ask permission to   
 skate in Broadclough Mill,they usually
 let us. We pretend that we are on     
 television as famous roller skaters.  
 In summer we go to the park on our    
 bikes. We take 30pence to buy a drink 
 and a packet of crisps.               
                                       
 Girls have various hobbies such as    
 horse riding,running,swimming and     
 other sports. Some like looking after 
 animals,going to the fair,art and     
 collecting things like pop posters,   
 badges and postcards.                 
                                       
 Sylvia likes all kinds of art such as 
 origami(the art of paper folding),    
 pencil drawing and painting with water
 colours and oil paints.               </content>
