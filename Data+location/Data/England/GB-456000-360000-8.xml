		<title>08ST. ALBANS CHURCH</title>
		<content>      St.Albans Church is just one of  
 the churches in Forest Town.It has    
 two graveyards.The religion of it is  
 the Church of England.                
      The church has arched windows.   
 But some of them are stained. Inside  
 there is a font which they use to     
 christen babies in. The service is on 
 Sundays.Inside the church the seats   
 that you sit on are called pews. There
 is a choir but it is not very big. A  
 lady plays the organ.                 
      The vicar is called Rev.Walford. 
 There is the vicar's house next door  
 and a church hall. The church is not  
 very old, in fact the school is older 
 than the church. The church was built 
 in 1910 and the school was built in   
 1908.There is another church in Forest
 Town. It is a Methodist Church and it 
 is quite new.            {LEE RHOADES,
