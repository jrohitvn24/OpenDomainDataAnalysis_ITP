		<title>01GARFORTH JUDO CLUB</title>
		<content> Every Friday I go to {Garforth Judo   
{Club.}The instructor teaches members  
 how to defend themselves. We learn how
 to throw an attacker on to the floor  
 and hold him down.                    
 We have{fighting contests}to practise 
 our skills. If you begin to get hurt  
 you tap on the floor and your opponent
 must let you go. If he doesn't he     
 he receives a penalty point. You must 
 always be careful to land properly to 
 avoid serious injury. Some moves, like
 strangle holds, are very dangerous and
 if not released immediately could lead
 to loss of consciousness. No-one must 
 mess about!                           
 Sometimes we have{fun days}to help    
 raise money. These involve events such
 as{bed races}(someone on a bed is     
 pushed round an obstacle course by    
 four team-mastes), or{pillow fights.} 
 Club nights{cost 80p}for two hours.   </content>
