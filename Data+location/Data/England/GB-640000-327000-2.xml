		<content> Home life today in villages on the    
 North Norfolk Coast.Sea Palling,      
 Hempstead and Eccles.                 
 This is an area of North Norfolk Coast
 including part of the village of Sea  
 Palling, the hamlet of Eccles and a   
 small settlement known as the Bush    
 Estate.                               
 The land which had traditionally been 
 grazing marsh is now almost entirely  
 arable.                               
 The remainder of the area is coastal  
 dune and marrams. The village of Sea  
 Palling  is mainly residential, it's  
 population is swelled in summer by    
 holidaymakers mainly accommodated in  
 the caravan sites in the area.        
 The village lies on low land behind   
 the dunes and in the past has been    
 subject to sea flooding, but now has a
 concrete wall beneath the dunes to    
 defend it from the North Sea.         </content>
