		<title>02THE CHURCH, MANOR, AND MILL.</title>
		<content>     Hollingbourne is situated on the  
 Pilgrim's and North Downs Ways.The    
 church, rebuilt after the earthquake  
 of 1382 contains, among other         
 treasures, the Culpeper Tapestry. A   
 unique piece of ecclesiastical        
 embroidery, it is a large rectangular 
 piece of velvet, with a deep border of
 applied motifs depicting in glowing   
 colour various fruits, bordered by    
 cherubs. It was possibly worked by    
 daughters of Thomas Culpeper in the   
 seventeenth century.                  
     The Culpepers are connected with  
 the Tudor Manor which faces the       
 church. This building contains        
 evidence of earlier Plantagenet       
 architecture. They also possessed     
 Manor Mill,the last remaining of the  
 four mills on the bourne. Mr. Wratten,
 the last miller, worked the mill till 
 1925. The mill wheel remains.         </content>
