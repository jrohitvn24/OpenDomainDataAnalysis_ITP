		<content> There are three places of worship -   
 "St. John's Methodist Chapel", "All   
 Saints" church which is the Parish    
 Church of Market Weighton and "All    
 Saints" church at Shiptonthorpe.      
 Near "St. John's Chapel" is the       
 original Methodist chapel built in    
 l786 at which John Wesley preached in 
 June l788.  The Minister today is the 
 Reverend K. Jarvis.  The Reverends    
 Exley and Sellers are the two vicars. 
 The chapel and churches are well      
 attended mainly by older people and   
 married people with their young       
 families.  Great efforts have been    
 made to attract more people by social 
 activities connected with the place of
 worship such as Bible study,          
 discussion groups and fellowship      
 meetings.
