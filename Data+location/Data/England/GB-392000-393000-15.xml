		<content> The Advertiser is a{free newspaper    
 which delivers 84,957 copies into     
 Tameside homes. It has 56 pages and is
 paid for by{advertisements.           
  The main stories in the paper for    
 27th June 1985 were about an ex-wife  
 who tried to hire someone to kill her 
 husband, and a man who raised Â£200 for
 the Baby Unit at Tameside Hospital by 
 letting people shave off his hair.    
  Inside we read about an old lady who 
 thought that two men were helping     
 her,but when she wasn't looking they  
 stole Â£3000. A man wrote a letter to  
 the paper about Hyde saying it now    
 looks dirty and old. A picture showed 
 some policemen in our area riding     
 push-bikes again to get around.In a   
 story about primary education we read 
 about our science work and the French 
 that will be taught in all Tameside   
 primary schools from September.       </content>
