  { Redhill school} asked local people 
whether they are satified with the     
local shops. { Mottingham}  "They are  
too expensive because there is no      
competition" "The shops  are alright   
for basic items but you need           
to go to Eltham or Bromley for luxuries
{Chislehurst}"Yes I can do all my      
shopping in the village. Sainsbury's   
supermarket is good and I am           
satisfied. In fact some local shops    
such as Mottingham village now have no 
butchers and only one grocer's         
store.Perhaps the change in types of   
shops is a reflection of changing      
interests. {Wyborne School} looked at  
shops in {New Eltham}.An antique shop  
has closed replaced by a Chinese       
restaurant.Two video shops have opened 
and a computer shop has expanded.The   
oldld  sweet shop is now a video hire  </content>
