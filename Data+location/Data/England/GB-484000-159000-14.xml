		<title>14What My Gran Said</title>
		<content> I asked my Gran what she thought of   
 Camberley. My comments are in blue.   
                                       
 A long time ago there used to be      
 many houses in Camberley.{It was tiny}
 Now-a-days it is all factories and    
 office blocks with only a few houses. 
{There are 8 times more houses than    
{when Gran moved here.}The Frimley Road
 used to be a cart track{it's now a    
{major bus route}and behind it used to 
 to be a big common. Now there are     
 about twenty-four factories with a    
 small field behind them.{True}        
 I remember an old-fashioned sweet     
 shop, but with all the modernisation  
 that has taken place, it has been     
 re-placed by a take-away fish-and-chip
 shop.{ We have 3 new sweet shops now  
 Also where there used to be houses    
 there is now an office block.{People  
{have to work somewhere. }             </content>
