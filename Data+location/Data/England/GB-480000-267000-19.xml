		<content>The children of Sywell Primary School  
conducted a survey of peoples eating   
habits.Most weekdays, people start the 
day with cereals and toast, and coffee 
or tea.Lunches tend to be snacks (most 
children take packed lunches to school)
 A hot cooked meal is eaten at night   
when the family is together. At        
weekends, breakfast tends to be the    
traditional egg and bacon meal and the 
main meal of the day is eaten at       
midday. In the evening, bread, butter  
and jam, or beans on toast and cake is 
usual.Eating in restaurants is popular.
The children of Sywell are fortunate   
because they can have hot dinners at   
midday. They cost 60p. A typical week's
 menu:sausage,beans,mash,apple pie,    
custard; fish,chips,biscuits,milkshake;
 roast pork,potatoes,cabbage,stuffing, 
jelly; salad,jacket potatoes,jam tart; 
cheese pie,mash,tomato,chocolate cake. </content>
