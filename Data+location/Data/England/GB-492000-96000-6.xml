 properties are flats which are        
 situated near the town centre whilst  
 the more expensive houses are to be   
 found on the Aldwick Road private

{Regency and Georgian houses,          
 especially along the sea front and in 
 The Steyne. There is also evidence of

 in this area is{The White Tower}in    
 Aldwick Road, built by John Hawes in

 to give the impression that the       
 building is higher than twelve metres.
