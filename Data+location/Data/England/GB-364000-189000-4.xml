		<title>04CHILTERN PARK ESTATE</title>
		<content> Chiltern Park Estate, Thornbury is a  
 typical, modern, open plan housing    
 estate consisting of about 380        
 relatively expensive, Georgian style  
 houses. There are no amenities on     
 the estate which was built about 10   
 years ago. Most residents travel into 
 Bristol for their employment although 
 some of the wives work locally. The   
 families mostly own two vehicles and  
 have more than one income each week.  
 The majority do not live near their   
 extended family. They have moved to   
 their present houses from all over the
 country, including Bristol, but the   
 majority previously lived within      
 Thornbury. Their leisure activities   
 are varied but sports and keep fit are
 the most popular. The residents enjoy 
 living on this estate although about  
 one third of them would prefer to have
 more playgrounds or parks.            </content>
