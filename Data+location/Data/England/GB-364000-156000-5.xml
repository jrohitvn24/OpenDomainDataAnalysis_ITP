		<content>{ Radford Mill Farm}covers 73 acres.It 
 is an organic farm.That is a very     
 progressive yet traditional type of   
 farming,in which chemicals and        
 artificial fertilizers are not        
 used.Instead manure is used on the    
 land.In order to maintain a natural   
 balance,many animals are kept.        
  The animals include beef and dairy   
 cattle,pigs,sheep,ducks,geese,hens,   
 goats,guinea fowl,and a donkey.Trout  
 are also kept in the farm mill ponds. 
  The crops grown on the farm include  
 field beans,swede,potatoes and grass. 
  There are 3 acres of organically     
 grown vegetables.Farm produce is sold 
 to a health food shop in Bristol.     
  The Farm has a long history.It was   
 formerly a water mill.The machinery   
 used is mainly for hay-making.There is
 a hay trailer,three tractors and a    
 muck-spreader.                        </content>
