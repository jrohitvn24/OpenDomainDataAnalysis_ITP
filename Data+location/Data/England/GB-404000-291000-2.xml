		<content>Homes in the area are predominantly    
owner-occupied.There is a small area of
modern council houses built on the     
site of Hamstead Colliery.             
 A noticeable aspect concerning the    
houses in the area is that few have    
been built with garages,necessitating  
parking on the roads.Only the larger   
houses along the main roads have       
garages constructed with the house.The 
Perry Beeches Estate,built by the First
National Housing Trust in the 1930's is
of red brick;the houses provide two and
three bedroomed accommodation for      
families;the houses were built for 250 
pounds and are now selling at 18,000   
pounds.                                
 Young families are moving into the    
area but many homes are still occupied 
by single,elderly persons.             
 A general impression of well-kept     
houses and gardens prevails.           </content>
