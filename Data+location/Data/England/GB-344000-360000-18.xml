		<title>18Buses;Other routes:Cheshire.</title>
		<content> 2 vehicles per family is not rare     
 (except in Saighton),so buses often   
 run at a loss being under-used.Buses  
 over the whole area only run every 2  
 hours with more before 9am.&amp; around   
 5pm. (5 services use the A41 road but 
 as they take various routes buses are 
 not more frequent).There are none on  
 Sunday &amp; some do not run on Saturday, 
 Tuesday or Thursday either.           
 In the NE.only pleasure craft now use 
 the Shropshire Union canal with 24    
 (cabin cruisers &amp; long boats) by the  
 towpath at private moorings.Also in   
 the NE.is the partly embanked multiple
 track railway from Chester to Crewe   
 but the track from the Whitchurch     
 branch has been replaced by poor      
 trees,rough grass,brambles,weeds &amp; a  
 stony path.Other paths are by or from 
 the canal &amp; are like the 8 leading to 
 Saighton (4 from the A41) little used.</content>
