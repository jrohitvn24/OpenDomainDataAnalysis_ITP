		<content> THE AREA HAS A LOW DENSITY OF         
 POPULATION AND THUS SCHOOLS FOR THE   
 CHILDREN OF THE AREA ARE SOME DISTANCE
 FROM THEIR HOMES.THE CHILDREN BEGIN IN
 SMALL RURAL PRIMARY SCHOOLS AT {GREAT 
{ELLINGHAM }OR {ROCKLANDS.}GREAT       
 ELLINGHAM HAS ABOUT 130 ON ROLL AND   
 ROCKLANDS 50.AT 11 THE CHILDREN       
 TRANSFER TO {ATTLEBOROUGH HIGH SCHOOL 
 OR TO ANOTHER SCHOOL OF THE PARENTS'  
 CHOICE.THERE IS A PRIVATE GRAMMAR     
 SCHOOL IN THETFORD.                   
 TWO ISSUES DOMINATE THE EDUCATIONAL   
 INSTITUTIONS OF THE AREA.THE FIRST OF 
 THESE IS THE FUTURE OF THE VILLAGE    
 SCHOOL WHICH IS SEEN AS UNECONOMIC BY 
 THE L.E.A. AND THE FUTURE OF ROCKLANDS
 SCHOOL MUST BE IN SOME DOUBT ALTHOUGH 
 ,AT THE PRESENT,ONLY SCHOOLS WITH A   
 ROLE BELOW 30 ARE BEING CONSIDERED FOR
 CLOSURE.ARGUEMENTS ARE BASED ON       
 ECONOMICS RATHER THAN QUALITY.        </content>
