		<title>12Survey of Hauxton</title>
		<content>  We interviewed a number of people    
 living around the Hauxton area, people
 with jobs such as the church warden   
 and the village postman. Most of them 
 used bikes or cars as transport. Most 
 of them also enjoyed sports, including
 cricket, swimming and jogging. They   
 bought their food from Great Shelford,
 Newmarket and Cambridge. They all     
 travelled to Cambridge for larger     
 items such as clothes or furniture. A 
 number of them wanted better          
 facilities for their sporting         
 activities, and also the wish for     
 their village to be kept clean and    
 tidy.
