		<title>18A Policeman in Sutton on Sea</title>
		<content>{Mr A.Cooney}has been a policeman in   
 Sutton for 8 years.He studied to be a 
 policeman at Panel Ash.The most common
 crime here is criminal damage.There   
 are about 20 car crashes a years in   
 Sutton but some are not reported.The  
 worst break-in was 5 or 6 years       
 ago.During the miners' strike         
{PC.Cooney's}life was very difficult   
 because the other policemen went there
 and he had to do their jobs as well as
 his own.He has never been seriously   
 injured but one Christmas Eve he was  
 hit in the eys by a piece of wood     
 thrown by some boys who had had too   
 much to drink and were messing about. 
{Mr Cooney}thinks the worst thing he   
 has to do is to deal with accidents   
 involving children.Although{PC.Cooney 
 does report people he does not like   
 doing it.
