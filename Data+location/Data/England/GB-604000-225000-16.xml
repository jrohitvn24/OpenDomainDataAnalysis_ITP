		<title>16A HEDGE IN ELMSTEAD.</title>
		<content>    Allens Farm has lots of{hedges. }  
 In two 30 metre stretches we found    
 many different bushes and trees.      
 In the first stretch we found{oak,  } 
{hawthorn}and{buckthorn.}In the second 
 stretch of{30 metres}we found that    
 there were more{ash,beech}and         
{buckthorn}than{elder}and{hazel.}The   
 first hedge is probably 300 years old 
 and the second hedge 500 years old    
 because each species is worth         
 approximately 100 years. There were a 
 lot of{nettles}and other plants at the
 bottom of the hedge such as{foxglove, 
{ferns, hogweed, black bryony,dog rose,
{white campion}and{honey suckle.}At    
 Allens Farm there are some{beehives,  
 a{moorhen}on the pond and some        
{partridges.}Allens Farm dates back to 
{1584}.There was probably a building   
 before Allens Farm because it was     
 mentioned in the first{Domesday Book. </content>
