		<content> In this area there are many holiday   
 cottages, pubs, and bed and breakfast 
 places.People come here for their     
 holidays to see the wildlife and to   
 walk up the fells.Some people come    
 here because of the close proximity of
 the lakes where you can do water      
 skiing,boating and swimming. We are   
 also close to the Yorkshire Dales     
 which are good for potholing,caving   
 and walking. We are close to Morecambe
 which is a typical seaside resort     
 with beaches,amusement arcades,bingo, 
 illuminations etc.Lancaster, another  
 nearby town, has great historical     
 interest.It has a castle and a        
 museum. The museum has Roman remains  
 because Lancaster was a Roman City.   
 The castle is on a hill which in those
 days would be very useful if it was   
 attacked by savages or another race.It
 was also an important port.           </content>
