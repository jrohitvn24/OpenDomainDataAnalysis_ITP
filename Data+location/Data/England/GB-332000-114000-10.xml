		<title>10DONYATT RAILWAY CUTTING</title>
		<content> The railway in Donyatt closed in 1962 
 and was turned into a nature reserve  
 in 1981/82. The trains ran from       
 Taunton to Chard. Part of the railway 
 has been turned into a road. In the   
 rest of the cutting the lines have    
 been removed and the place has been   
 left alone for plants to grow.        
   There are some rare plants in the   
 cutting such as the bee orchid and    
 there are common plants like brambles,
  and nettles. Over sixty species of   
 bird have been seen in the cutting.   
 The main types of trees are oak, ash, 
 apple, hawthorn and hazelnut. There   
 is evidence of rabbits and badgers in 
 the cutting. The cutting is a habitat 
 for many different kinds of creatures.
