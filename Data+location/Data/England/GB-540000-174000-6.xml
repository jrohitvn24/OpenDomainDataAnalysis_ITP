We went to see Mrs. Hollingsworth who  
has lived in Eltham since 1910.        
She can remember Eltham as a village   
and going on the trams from Eltham to  
the Blackwall Tunnel.Her father worked 
on a horse bus and she got free rides. 
In her childhood large families might  
not have any socks or shoes and many   
had clothes passed down from others.   
The school leaving age was 14 and when 
you left school you were picked out to 
do jobs.Sometimes a nurse would come   
round to see if you were clean enough. 
In the early days of television only a 
few families had them so they went     
round to their friends to watch the    
Queen's coronation.In Eltham there were
many street parties on coronation day.
