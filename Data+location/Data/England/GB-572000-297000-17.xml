		<title>17LAW AND ORDER IN NORTHWOLD</title>
		<content> A team of 3 Constables,one of whom is 
 resident in Northwold,police a group  
 of 8 villages,including Northwold,    
 patrolling in a car in radio contact  
 with Norfolk Constabulary Headquarters
 at Norwich.                           
 The main law and order problems are   
 road traffic offences,petty crime and 
 burglaries.However the constable can  
 and will be called upon to deal with  
 any aspect of police work that will   
 arise from time to time.The most      
 swiftly growing menace to society in  
 1985 is drug abuse,which has not      
 escaped Northwold entirely.The problem
 is that the people involved resort to 
 crime in order to finance their ever  
 growing dependence on drugs. Offenders
 usually appear before Thetford        
 Magistrates Court,and are tried by    
 Justices of the Peace,unless the case 
 warrents a hearing at a higher court. </content>
