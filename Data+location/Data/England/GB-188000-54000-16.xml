		<title>16CLOCK GARAGE</title>
		<content> Mr and Mrs Tabb own Clock Garage. Once
 Clock Garage was burnt down and was   
 rebuilt in the 1930s . It is open from
 7am to 8pm . The Garage is open every 
 day of the year apart from Christmas  
 Day. They  sell up to 8-9000 gallons  
 of petrol a week. In the winter they  
 sell up to 2-3000 gallons. When       
 Summercourt Fair people come, the     
 garage sells lots of diesel for       
 lorries but because the A.30 is closed
 all that day so they sell little      
 petrol. Five people work in the garage
 all together, three in the garage and 
 two on the forecourt. Caravans are for
 sale around the garage but these are  
 being sold by another company. The    
 garage people hope there will be a    
 diversion of the proposed village by  
 pass so that the new road still       
 brings traffic by the garage.
