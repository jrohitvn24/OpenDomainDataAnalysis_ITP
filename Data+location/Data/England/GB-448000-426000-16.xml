		<title>16BURTON SALMON FOOD 1</title>
		<content>   The survey of the eating patterns of
 the children of Burton Salmon provided
 the following information. The survey 
 was completed during a summer month   
 and this is reflected in the type of  
 food consumed.                        
   For the younger school children,aged
 less than 8 years,the favourite food  
 was fish and chips. Salad and chicken 
 was almost as popular.                
   Older children voted salad as the   
 favourite food with fish and chips the
 second most popular. Beans on toast   
 was also highly rated by both groups  
 of children.                          
   For breakfast on most days younger  
 children had cereal and milk with a   
 fruit flavoured drink. On the few days
 when a cooked breakfast was eaten it  
 was usually toast or egg. Older       
 children followed a similar pattern.
