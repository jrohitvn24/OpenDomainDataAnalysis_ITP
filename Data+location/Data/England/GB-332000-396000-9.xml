		<title>09History of Litherland</title>
		<content> In the Domesday Book,Litherland was   
 pronounced as litterland or liderland 
 which means "sloping land". A Dane    
 named Uctred owned Litherland.        
 In 1770 the Canal was built and in    
 1774 the first Packet sailed.The      
 Packet was a passenger boat from      
 Liverpool to Bootle.                  
 St.Philip's School was built in 1867  
 and it was enlarged in 1881.In 1861   
 before the school was built           
 St.Philip's church was built ,at that 
 time all of Litherland was nothing but
 fields. Before St.Philip's new school 
 was built they had lessons in a room  
 above the stables at the Litherland   
 Hotel which had been converted into a 
 chapel. The population of Litherland  
 during the last two decades has grown 
 from 2,500 to 10,000,this was due to  
 the building of a railway.
