		<title>19TWO SCHOOLS IN HARROW</title>
		<content>    There is a four-tier educational   
 system in Harrow. Young people attend 
 First Schools between 5_8 years,      
 Middle Schools between 9_12 years,    
 High Schools between 13_16 years and  
 (if they wish) Sixth Form Colleges    
 post 16 years. The latter will become 
 Tertiary Colleges in 1986. All state  
 schools are non-selective.            
 STANBURN MIDDLE SCHOOL has about 380  
 pupils. It was built in 1938 on a     
 4.5 acre site in open fields. Huts    
 were added in 1945 and new classroom  
 blocks in 1968. Its roll has dropped  
 in recent years as birthrates reduce. 
 CANONS HIGH SCHOOL has about 720      
 students. It was opened in 1954 as    
 Downer Grammar School. It became      
 comprehensive in 1974. Its roll has   
 also declined recently but should     
 now stabilise. It is a multi-ethnic   
 school committed to education for all.</content>
