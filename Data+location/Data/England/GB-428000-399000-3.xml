		<title>03Views of Thurgoland</title>
		<content> One day last week Mr Furniss,Mrs      
 Bailey and Mrs Bedford came to be     
 interviewed. We asked them what they  
 thought of Thurgoland.They all said   
 that we needed a butcher's shop and Mr
 Furniss suggested that we want a cafe 
 so we can get more people to travel   
 into Thurgoland.Mrs Bailey said we    
 should have a fish and chip           
 shop.someone asked "Do you like       
 Thurgoland better now or in the       
 past?"They all said that they liked it
 better now because they have          
 electricity and a better bus service  
 to Barnsley and                       
 Sheffield.But Mrs Bailey said that she
 didn't want all the new houses        
 because she didn't know all the new   
 people.All of them said that they     
 didn't want Thurgoland any bigger than
 it is now.                            
                                       </content>
