		<content>   {Bradninch}Papermill is situated in 
{Hele.}It is about 2km from our school}
 map (grid ref.996025). Paper was first
 made there in 1767. It was built by   
 the River{Culm}because the water was  
 needed to produce the paper. It was   
 also built by the{railway.}This       
 transported raw materials and finished
 products. Nowadays the River Culm is  
 still needed for water. The factory   
 also gets water from the wells close  
 to the mill. After using the water it 
 is treated to remove pollution at a   
 treament works on the hill behind     
 Strathculm Road. The water is used    
 several times before it leaves. Paper 
 is taken from the mill by large       
 lorries. Wiggins Teape send their     
 paper to Europe, India, South Africa, 
 New Zealand and parts of the Middle   
 East.
