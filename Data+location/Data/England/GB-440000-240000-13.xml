		<content>The narrow roads and large numbers of  
parked cars in Banbury's Bretch Hill   
area makes this one of Oxfordshires    
accident black spots. To help make the 
older primary children safer on their  
bicycles before they go to secondary   
school, a great deal of training goes  
into making them aware of the dangers  
on the road. They are taught to control
and ride their bikes properly and how  
to negotiate traffic and junctions.    
Whilst they are on the road they wear  
yellow safety jackets and are under the
constant supervision of two teachers.  
In the classroom they are taught the   
rules of road safety and to recognise  
traffic signals and signs. Generally by
the end of the course most children    
pass the practical test given to them  
by a Road Safety Officer or a local    
policeman.
