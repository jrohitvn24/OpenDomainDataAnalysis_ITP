		<title>17Local History, Scoutmoor.</title>
		<content> Views to the west from Scoutmoor are  
 dominated by the{Peel Monument,}or    
 Holcombe Tower above the village of   
 Holcombe. This momument is in memory  
 of the second Sir Robert Peel, a great
 Statesman and one time Prime Minister,
 to commemorate the services he        
 rendered in connection with the repeal
 of the Corn Laws. The monument  was   
 built in 1852 by public subscription  
 at a cost of Â£900. The monument serves
 as a prominent and useful land mark   
 for any walker who may have lost his  
 sense of direction.                   
    Beyond the path that forms part of 
 Rossendale Way, and the open moorland 
 is a cross making the summit of       
 Whittle Pike at 468 metres. The cross 
 is thought to be to the memory of a   
 local scout leader.
