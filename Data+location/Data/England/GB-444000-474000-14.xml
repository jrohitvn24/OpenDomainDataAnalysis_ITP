 section of the village life with 2    
 men's XI's (playing in the York Senior
 League) a junior and a ladies team.   
 The Club has played in the National   
 Village Championship since 1970 and in
 1976 played in the final at Lord's.   
 In 1982 we staged the semi-final at   
 Sessay, but lost.  The ground is      
 always immaculate and in 1984 was     
 marked second best in the league.     
 The Hall incorporates changing rooms -
 used by cricketers and{tennis}players.
 As well as the cricket field and      
 tennis courts there is a{bowling}green
 which is a hive of activity during the
 summer months.  Summer also sees the  
 schoolchildren playing rounders and   
 cricket and their annual sports day is
 held here.                            
 The various clubs frequently hold     
 their meetings in the Hall.           </content>
