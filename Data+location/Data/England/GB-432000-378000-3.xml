		<title>03       BRADWAY</title>
		<content> The village of Bradway lies just to   
 the north of the northern Derbyshire  
 border.It has kept much of its        
 character as a village,although it now
 lies within the boundary of Sheffield.
 Much of the housing is  private and   
 either semi_detached or detached,in a 
 variety of styles, some of it looking 
 out over open  countryside and        
 farmland into Derbyshire. The         
 people who live here are served by two
 parades of small shop and bus servies 
 into the centre of Sheffield.         
 primary school has closed down due to 
 the small number of children, but the 
 majority of 100 older people who are  
 now living in Bradway are very well   
 looked after in recreation.  There is 
 a golf club, a golf range, bowls club 
 and community centre.
