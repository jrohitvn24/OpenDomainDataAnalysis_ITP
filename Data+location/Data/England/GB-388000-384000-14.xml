		<title>14THE GHOST OF BRAMALL HALL</title>
		<content> In Bramall Hall there is a ghost of   
 Dame Dorothy Davenport she built most 
 of the Hall.The ghost haunts her      
 bedroom which is also called the ghost
 room or the paradise room.A man called
 Rodger who worked at The Hall once    
 went into the paradise room and he    
 heard rustling,he thought it was Lorna
 who also worked there.Then a hand     
 touched his shoulder and a voice said 
 "HELLO" he turned round and saw Dame  
 Dorothy,he ran off screaming.The same 
 thing happened when two school boys   
 went into the room so they turned and 
 ran out.Lorna gave them both a cup of 
 tea to relieve them.They were very    
 frightened.Both of these incidents    
 happened to people who did not believe
 in ghosts.
