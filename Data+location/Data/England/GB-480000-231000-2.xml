		<content>    These days there are quite a few   
ways of communicating.The most obvious 
is the telephone.All you do is press a 
few buttons and you can talk to anyone 
you want to.But there are other ways,  
for using your computer for an example 
,you type in one message and you can   
get a reply.Also on the computer you   
can touch the screen to speak to other 
people.                                
    Another way is by sending letters. 
You can get different types of stamps  
the first class stamp costs seventeen  
pence.That gets there quicker than any 
others.The second class costs thirteen 
pence.                                 
    There are thousands of people      
communicating every second.But the way 
of communication used the most is just 
talking in the street.
