		<content> There are more than a dozen farms that
 use land in this area.                
 Many are very old and some were       
 accounted in the original Domesday.   
 Between them these farms cover a wide 
 range of mixed farming.               
 Pigs are kept and end up as bacon at  
 the Harris factory in Totnes.         
 This is the home of the South Devon   
 cattle but some farmers have given up 
 the meat side because of the EEC.     
 Milk is produced at 4500l per cow.    
 The milk is collected by tanker.      
 Growing is mostly Barley and Silage   
 but Potatoes and other cereals are    
 also grwon on a lesser scale..        
 Most farms employ casual or farm      
 and all are well mechanised some even 
 to owning their own Combine.          
 A lot of the farms also make income   
 from cottage and caravan lettings     
 during the summer.                    </content>
