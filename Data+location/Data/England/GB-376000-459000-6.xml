		<title>06Farm Animals in Rathmell NW</title>
		<content>    There  are two main groups of      
 stock: the ones away from the         
 farmhouse and the ones close to it.   
 Away from the farmhouse are{sheep     
 which make up 66% of the total stock  
 and cows which make up 30%. The cows  
 are split very evenly into{milk cows  
 for dairy produce and{cattle for beef.
 The sheep live furthest from the      
 farmhouse on the higher ground, as do 
 the cattle, but the milk cows are     
 closer to the farm for milking. It is 
 these animals that provide the        
 farmer's livelihood: wool, meat, milk 
 and sale of stock for breeding.       
    Around the farmhouse there may be  
 some{hens}and{geese}and a few{pigs.   
 Sometimes{horses}are kept but are     
 mainly for riding. With the large     
 number of sheep,{sheepdogs}are needed 
 and they will live near the farmhouse.
