		<title>01Footpaths in Ampleforth.</title>
		<content>    There are several very enjoyable   
 footpaths in the village, some        
 carrying on for many miles. One leads 
 down by a river past a mill, another  
 branching off this leads down the     
 valley on a walk of about 1.5 miles to
 Old{Pilfit farm.}A number leave the   
 main road and run by it for a few     
 miles. One of these leads up through a
 private garden along the side of a    
 small valley and to the right of      
{Studford}or{Studfold Ring,}a          
 rectilinear embanked enclosure with an
 internal ditch, probably of Iron Age  
 origin.                               
   The moors either side of the valley 
 reach heights of about 750 feet and   
 the valley sides gently slope down to 
 about 230 feet. Two streams flow down 
 to the valley to{Shallow dale}and to  
 Smith Hill. There are pleasant walks  
 beside each of these.                 </content>
