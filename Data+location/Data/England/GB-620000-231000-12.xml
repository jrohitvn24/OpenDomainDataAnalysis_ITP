		<title>12COPPERAS WOOD - HISTORY</title>
		<content>{Copperas Wood Nature Reserve}is thirty
 eight and a half acres of woodland and
 shore, situated between the Wrabness  
 Road and the River Stour, one mile    
 from Ramsey village. The wood is      
 between{300 and 500 years old}and     
 mainly consists of{sweet chestnuts    
 which were planted originally for     
 their timber.It was managed as a      
{commercial concern}until the          
 1940's.Then the market for the timber 
 had{declined}because farming was      
 changing in the area from pastural to 
 arable (as it is today). There was,   
 therefore, less demand for fence posts
 and fencing. The owner decided to     
 abandon the business, there being no  
 buyer. It remained overgrown and      
 neglected until it was bought, some   
 six years ago by the{Essex Naturalist 
{Trust.
