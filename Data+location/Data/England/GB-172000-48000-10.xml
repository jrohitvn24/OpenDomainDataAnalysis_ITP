		<title>10Entertainment in St. Agnes</title>
		<content> Not having a cinema in St. Agnes, much
 of the entertainment is provided by   
 the local residents.  Young people of 
 the Methodist Church stage a Christmas
 pantomime.  The Theatre Players, with 
 a workshop in Goonown, produce plays  
 twice a year.  These range from       
 humorous to historic.  At special     
 events a street theatre may be seen,  
 their production geared to fit the    
 occasion.  St. Agnes Singers give a   
 variety of concerts and often visit   
 nursing  homes, local pubs, and senior
 citizens clubs providing a varied     
 programme.  During summer a visiting  
 jester (in costume) provides live     
 entertainment in local pubs.          
 Accompanied on his lute-shaped guitar 
 he renders a selection of Cornish     
 favourites.  Many organisations put on
 a hoe-down in winter months with a    
 live band and a caller.               </content>
