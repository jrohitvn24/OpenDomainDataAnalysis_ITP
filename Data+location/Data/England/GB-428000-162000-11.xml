		<title>11RELIGION IN SHALBOURNE</title>
		<content> Christianity has been the only reli-  
 gion of note here in the past 1,000   
 years. The parish church,{St Michael  
{and All Angels,}dates back to about   
 1208. Another church once existed at  
 the bottom of Rivar Road: only a few  
 stones remain. Two{19th century       
{Methodist Chapels}are no longer in    
 use. There are a few Roman Catholics  
 and some Methodists, but most other   
 villagers are either committed or     
 nominal members of The Church of      
 England.  The Parish of Shalbourne is 
 now linked with 7 other local parishes
 in the{Wexcombe Team. }Revd Michael   
 Ward, parish priest, is also the      
 Rector of the Wexcombe Team.  Services
 are held each Sunday and at major     
 festivals, including Holy Communion,  
 Matins and Evensong. Special services 
 are held at Christmas, Epiphany, Good 
 Friday, Harvest and Remembrance Sunday</content>
