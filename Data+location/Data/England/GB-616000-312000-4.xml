		<content>    { St.Margaret's church Drayton}was 
 built in the late 12th century. The   
 font is believed to be earlier than   
 the church and the lych gate is a much
 more recent addition.The grave yard   
 boasts a host of rare wild flowers.   
     {St. Edmund's,Taverham}is earlier,
 having a fine round tower,and is      
 partly thatched,as well as having many
 recent additions.                     
      {St.Edmund's,Costessey}was built 
 in 1300 on a slope,a most unusual     
 feature.Later additions to the church 
 include some  15th century flintwork  
 and a Jacobean pulpit from{Booton.   }
      The original{Drayton Lodge}was   
 built in the early 15th century by the
 famous{Sir John Fastolf}as a defence  
 against local landowners. It is to be 
 found on the Norwich road, in the     
 grounds of the Nurses' home.
