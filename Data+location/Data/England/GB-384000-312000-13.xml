		<content>STILE WHICH LEADS DOWN TO THE TOWPATH. 
UNDER THE BRIDGE WE NOTICED THE MARKS  
MADE BY THE WIRE TOW-ROPES IN IRON     
STAYS WHICH PROTECT THE BRICKWORK.TURN 
SOUTHWARDS AND WE SEE THAT THERE ARE   
MOORINGS AVAILABLE BY THE INN AS WELL  
AS ON THE TOWPATH SIDE.                
AS YOU MAKE YOUR WAY ALONG THE TOWPATH 
LOOK FOR HE FIRST GAP IN THE HAWTHORN  
HEDGE.UNTIL ABOUT 30 YEARS AGO THERE   
WAS A MILK WHARF HERE MADE OF OLD RAIL 
WAY SLEEPERS.EACH DAY MILK WAS COLLECT-
ED AND TAKEN TO WOLVERHAMPTON.FURTHER  
ON,WHERE THE CANAL GETS WIDER, THERE   
WAS A COAL WHARF.BOATS CAN STILL BE    
TURNED ROUND HERE.NEXT WE COME TO THE  
WAREHOUSE.THE AREA OUTSIDE THE WARE-   
HOUSE WAS USED TO DUMP STONE AND SLAG  
FOR THE REPAIR OF VILLAGE ROADS.THE    
WAREHOUSE ITSELF WAS USED TO STORE     
GRAIN FOR THE LOCAL FARMERS BEFORE     
BOATS CARRIED THE SACKS TO THE MILL.   </content>
