		<content>      The airfield was built during the
 Second World War (1939-1945) and was  
 used for a number of purposes for both
 the American and British Air Forces.  
 Since it was closed 20 years ago there
 has been much discussion about its    
 use. Part has gone back to farming    
 land. A section of the runway is now  
 used as a stock car race track.       
 There is often a Sunday market on the 
 field and at Bank Holiday weekends    
 there are other special events and    
 rallies. The most controversial plan  
 is for a prison to be built on a large
 part of the field. The building of    
 this is now well advanced and opening 
 is planed for 1986 or 1987.
