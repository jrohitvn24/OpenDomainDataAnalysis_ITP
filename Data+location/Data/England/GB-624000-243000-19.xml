		<title>19NEWBOURNE GROWERS LTD.</title>
		<content>At the beginning of 1984, ten out of   
nearly 40 smallholders on the former   
Land Settlement Association estate at  
Newbourne agreed to pool their         
resources in a formally organised      
co-operative. Each member has          
contributed 1,500 pounds as an interest
free loan and committed all his salad  
crop products to the co-op for the next
five years. It is hoped that other     
growers will be persuaded to join them.
The holdings of the founder members    
range from 3 to 10 acres and between   
them they have nearly 10 acres under   
glass. The main product is tomatoes    
including high value cherry tomatoes   
packed in one-pound punnets and a full 
range of lettuce backed up by a variety
of other salad crops.                  
They are already supplying leading     
supermarket outlets and local          
wholesalers.                           </content>
