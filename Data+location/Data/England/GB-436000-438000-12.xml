		<title>12HOUSING IN THORNER (2)</title>
		<content> Very few of the houses on Main Street 
 have a front garden, but have         
 extensive rear gardens.               
                                       
 Houses are both rented and privately  
 owned. Prices of privately owned      
 properties (in the year 1985) varied  
 between Â£29000 for a small 3 bedroomed
 terraced house, to semi-detached      
 houses of around Â£40000 and an        
 'individual' stone detached house for 
 Â£67000.                               
                                       
 Thorner seems to have become an       
 executive dormitory suburb of Leeds,  
 and so house prices are higher than in
 the surrounding area, and reflect     
 supply and demand.
