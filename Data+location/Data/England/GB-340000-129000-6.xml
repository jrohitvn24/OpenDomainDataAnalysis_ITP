		<title>06CIDER MAKING, HIGH HAM</title>
		<content> Cider is still made in the traditional
 way in High Ham. It takes about 356kg 
 apples to make a hogshead, about 245  
 litres, of cider. The apples are      
 tipped into a large mincing machine.  
 Most of these are now driven by       
 tractor, but formerly 4 men turned 2  
 handles. The apples are pulped into a 
 "pummace", which is put in a press, in
 10cm layers, alternating with equal   
 layers of straw, to a depth of 1m. The
 head of the press is screwed down to  
 compress this "cheese" and squeeze    
 out all the juice which flows into a  
 wooden tub. From here it is dipped and
 poured into a wooden bucket with a    
 strainer at the bottom, and then      
 poured into barrels. The juice is left
 to "work" in the barrels for several  
 weeks before the cider is ready to    
 drink. The discarded "cheese" is fed  
 to cattle.                            </content>
