		<content> Despite the small population and      
 absence of municipal facilities, there
 is a wide range of entertainment and  
 recreational activities.  All you need
 to give is your time and interest.    
 There are clubs if you wish to sing,  
 dance, act, listen to music, ramble,  
 arrange flowers, photography, learn   
 more about gardening and the          
 arts.  Branches of national societies 
 include Cubs, Brownies, Scouts,       
 Guides, Young Farmers, Mother's Union,
 W.Is., British Legion and Senior      
 Citizens.  For friendships abroad     
 there is town twinning; closer to home
 the Social Club.  If you enjoy sport  
 and have a ball, you can kick, bat,   
 bowl or hit it with a a hockey stick. 
 The school facilities allow for       
 swimming, archery, badmington and     
 gymnastics.  The pubs offer darts,    
 skittles and pool and excellent cider.</content>
