		<title>01The Wolds around Ulceby</title>
		<content> The landscape is predominantly chalk  
 downland rising to about 110m above   
 datum, at its hightest. Deeply incised
 valleys, mainly dry (but with springs 
 &amp; wells in places) are the result of  
 peri-glacial activity. Some "Glacial  
 Till" forms a veneer on some hills;   
 while ancient alluvium occupies       
 elongated strips in valleys, &amp; some   
 hillsides. Woodlands are generally on 
 glacial till. Settlement is small &amp;   
 scattered with about 180 people living
 or working in the area. Alford exerts 
 an influence with its market craft    
 market &amp; limited industry. Farming &amp;  
 services are the main occupations     
 although there is a woodyard cum      
 builders' materials; &amp; coffin-making  
 in the former Chapel. The "Smithy"    
 still functions but no longer shoes   
 horses.
