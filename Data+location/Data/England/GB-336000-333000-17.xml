		<content>  E.T.C. (Ellesmere Timber Company)    
 supplies most of the local hardware   
 stores and  is also one of the main   
 suppliers of jobs for Ellesmere.Sixty 
 percent of the  wood comes locally    
 from Wales and the other forty        
 percent comes from Scotland.The wood  
 they use is soft wood.At E.T.C. there 
 are about one hundred and twenty five 
 workers.There is no waste because the 
 sawdust that is left over from the    
 machine is sucked through a tube into 
 a pile and used for chipboard.There   
 are big flexible saws called band     
 saws. They fit into pieces of         
 machinery and spin round to cut the   
 wood.They have to be cleaned and      
 sharpened every 4 hours.In one        
 production line they make eight       
 hundred slabs of wood a day.
