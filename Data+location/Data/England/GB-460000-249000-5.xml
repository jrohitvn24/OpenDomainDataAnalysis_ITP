		<title>05Blakesley Art Gallery.</title>
		<content>The Blakesley Gallery was converted    
from the old barn behind the house at  
No 10 The Green, formerly the Greyhound
pub.Its first owner,Helen Dare,was a   
metal sculptress who wanted to exhibit 
her own works but soon added those of  
friends and fellow artists. In 1982 it 
was aquired by the present proprietor, 
Ann Purser, who enlarged the Gallery   
space by bringing the upstairs section 
into use and also opening up an extra  
room.Oil paintings,water colours,      
prints,pottery,porcelain,glass,wood-   
carvings and jewellery are on show.    
Though local artists are always        
represented,other work comes from all  
over Britain,while the Visitors'Book   
records visitors to the Gallery from as
far afield as America and Australia.A  
fresh exhibition is mounted 5 times a  
year,and twice a year a concert of     
chamber music is held.                 </content>
