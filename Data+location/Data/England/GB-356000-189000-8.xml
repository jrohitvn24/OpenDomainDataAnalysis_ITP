		<title>08The Old Ferry Crossing, Aust</title>
		<content> About three-quarters of a mile from   
 the centre of Aust is Old Passage.    
 Before the opening of the Severn Road 
 Bridge in 1966  there was a regular   
 ferry service which carried passengers
 and vehicles across the River Severn  
 to Beachley. To have travelled via    
 Gloucester would have meant an        
 additional sixty mile journey. Old    
 passage is now largely a derelict site
 although it is still possible to see  
 the remains of the old car jetty,     
 ticket office and cafe. It is obvious 
 no effort has been made to preserve   
 the site as an historical monument for
 future generations. Adjacent to the   
 old ferry is Old Passage House,an     
 imposing building which was once an   
 inn but has now been modernised and   
 is a private dwelling house.
