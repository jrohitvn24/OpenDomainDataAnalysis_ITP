		<title>07Liskeard Cattle Market</title>
		<content> Two markets are held each week.Monday 
 is a Fat Stock Market auctioning      
 sheep for slaughter.This market serves
 the Caradon District,but occasionally 
 Lostwithiel farmers attend from the   
 Restormel District.The larger market  
 is on Thursdays when the main dealing 
 is in Store Cattle.The chief areas    
 served are Caradon,Restormel and West 
 Devon,but farmers have attended from  
 as far away as Penzance.Here calves   
 are mainly sold either for rearing or 
 further fattening.Last year,however,  
 some bullocks were sold for slaughter,
 fetching Â£850 each.The average price  
 is usually around Â£500-Â£600.Sheep sold
 for lamb usually sell at Â£30-Â£35 each.
 The market attracts many agricultural 
 stalls with a stock ranging from farm 
 machinery to produce and seed.
