		<content> Sturton-Le Steeple,Name origins.      
 The name of Sturton-Le -Steele has    
 some interesting origins.the old      
 English version is Stret tun:the      
 homesteadby the street.The street is  
 the old Roman road from Lincoln to    
 York.In 1086 the Domesday book records
  the name as Estretone and by the     
 nineteenth century the name was       
 Streton-en-le-Clay.It is not clear    
 when the latter was dropped in favour 
 of Le-Steeple.When later the fine     
 parish church of St Peter and St Paul 
 was built the tall pinnacled tower was
 a landmark for miles around.As well as
 the tower there are twelve fifteen    
 foot smaller pinnacles on Sturton     
 church.It is therefore possible that  
 the origins go back to "En -le        
 Steeple".
