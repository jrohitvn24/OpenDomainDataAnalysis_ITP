		<content>Rebecca, aged 8yrs 11mths. I got up at 
7.40am, washed,dressed and ate my break
-fast of spaghetti on toast. Mummy took
my brother and I to school in her car. 
Lessons this morning were 7-a-day and  
Nuffield Maths and I did some work     
about flowers with 2 friends in my     
class.During playtime at 10.30 I played
with Abbi on the climbing frame in the 
playground.Then I did more work until  
12.00 when I ate my packed lunch of    
peanut butter sandwiches, coffee cake  
a Twix bar.Before going out to play,   
I typed our flower programme on the    
computer. After lunch our teacher read 
a story called Gumbles on Guard.Then I 
painted a picture until home time at   
3.10.At home I watched T.V.until dinner
time-chicken pie,chips &amp; peas with     
Straw-berries &amp; ice cream to           
follow.ThenMy sister Nicola and I went
