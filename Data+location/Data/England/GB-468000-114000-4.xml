		<content> On Mondays Mrs.Peters comes in and    
 does needlework with us. Mrs. Triggs  
 and Mrs. Howard help with cooking. On 
 a Tuesday we have the computer and my 
 favourite game is Mr. Silly's Hat     
 Game. We have singing practice too.   
 The reading book I am on is called    
 ONCE LONG AGO, and the SMP card I am  
 on is Card 31. We write book          
 reviews.At the moment my topic is     
 Experiments.{Karen Stephens}Aged 7.

 On a Thursday at Half past nine I go  
 to violins and we come back at about a
 quarter to ten. After lunch it is PE  
 and if it is nice we go out and play  
 rounders. If it is not a nice day we  
 get the apparatus out and use that. At
 the end of a Thursday we have a game  
 like SIMON SAYS or Mr.Fowle reads us a
 story. {Christine Pullen} Aged 7 years
