		<title>07DECLINE OF SMALL FARMS</title>
		<content>  The farmer at Bluegates told us of   
 the nine farms that used to be in     
 Ashwell there are now only four. His  
 land was was once farmed by several   
 farmers.He could remember some of the 
 farms that had gone. They had changed 
 their use. One was Westbury farm also 
 Sam Wallace's Farrows Farm. Where the 
 dentist is now was Kirby's Manor Farm 
 which moved three miles out of the    
 village a hundred years ago. The land 
 is now part of Bluegates Farm and the 
 house is residential. The Angell's    
 farm is still there although there are
 houses in 'Angell's Meadow'. Then     
 there was a farm where the spraying   
 contractor now is. By the Springs     
 there was Duck Lake Farm. Up to 15    
 years ago the dairy was in ' Bacon's  
 Yard 'next to the school. It was small
 and inconvenient. It was smelly and   
 messy so he moved.It's all houses now.</content>
