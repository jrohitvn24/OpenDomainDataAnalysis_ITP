		<content> There are many examples of old stone  
 houses made from local limestone.The  
 old quarry east of Little Ponton is   
 now closed but there is a new one near
 the railway bridge at Great Ponton.   
   Most of the recent developments     
 occured in the 1960's it was then that
 the old people's bungalows and the    
 council houses in Cringleway were     
 built.Several old stone cottages were 
 demolished to make way for them.      
   The disused Primitive Chapel became 
 a dwelling in the 1940's but was      
 pulled down to make room for 8 council
 houses( built around 1956).           
   There is some concern about the     
 mixing between the new people in the  
 village and older residents.Those who 
 moved in,in the 1960's tend to keep   
 separate from the natives,having their
 own community centre.
