		<content>  The edge of the town is a good place 
to relax and get away from the         
buildings. We think that we are        
fortunate to live in a town that is    
surrounded with peaceful countryside.  
There are quiet country roads and also 
footpaths where we can get away from   
the cars. Along the paths you can see  
alf wildlife if you are quiet. The     
modern farms turn several small fields 
into one large field. This makes the   
farmer's job easier but it makes the   
paths less interesting. It is hard to  
beve that the paths were once the      
routes people to get to work or to go  
to the market or the only way to get to
their house.                           
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
