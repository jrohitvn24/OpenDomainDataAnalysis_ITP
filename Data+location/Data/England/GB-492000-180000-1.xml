		<title>01GAZETTEER OF SLOUGH EAST</title>
		<content> The area is mainly residential        
 bordered by the Slough Trading Estate 
 to the East and by some farm land to  
 the West.The main A4,London to Bath   
 road virtually cuts the area in       
 two.One of the main features of       
 Burnham is its High Street which is   
 composed of many old and interesting  
 buildings.The village of Burnham was  
 mentioned in the original Domesday    
 Book.The rest of the area is mainly   
 more modern housing which developed   
 after the construction of the Great   
 Western Railway and the subsequent    
 building of the Slough Trading Estate 
 The Estate is one of the largest in   
 Europe.Cippenham was once the site of 
 a Royal Palace but nearly all traces  
 of it have now disappeared.
