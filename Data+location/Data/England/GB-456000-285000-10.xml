		<title>10SPORTS' DAY IN GILMORTON</title>
		<content> Sports Day at Gilmorton School this   
 year was rather unusual.Apart from a  
 few running races all the races were  
 fun ones.In previous years we have had
 a points system and the house with the
 most points wins the trophy.This year 
 the 3As Awards determined who would   
 win the trophy and Sports Day was just
 a fun day.                            
 At 1.30 all of the school went across 
 to the sports field.The children sat  
 by the hedge and the spectators sat in
 the middle.Just as we were about to   
 start it poured with rain and we all  
 had to rush back into school.         
 After half an hour the rain stopped   
 and we returned to the field.         
 These are some of the races we        
 enjoyed:water on the                  
 head,dressing-up,obstacle,wheel-barrow
 ,sack,camel,tug-of-war.It was a very  
 enjoyable afternoon.                  </content>
