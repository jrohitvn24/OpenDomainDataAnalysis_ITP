		<title>05CELLULAR RADIO - OFFCHURCH</title>
		<content>   Recently erected at Burnt Heath Farm
 was a{Cellular Radio Mast,}jointly    
 owned by{British Telecom (Cellmet)}and
{Racal Vodaphone.}Each company operates
 an independent radio link for "in car"
 telephones.  The mast is one of a     
 chain spread across the area and      
 transmits over a radius of about 25   
 kilometres. Users, while travelling   
 along, have their calls directed      
 through the nearest mast automatically
 by giant computers.                   
{  The two companies}are in competition
 with each other and operate on        
 separate frequencies, but where it is 
 convenient they sometimes, as in this 
 case, use the same mast to relay      
 signals. The system is a recent       
 development and this mast is only now 
 coming into use.                      
{ It forms a land mark on the high land
{which can be seen from Cubbington.    </content>
