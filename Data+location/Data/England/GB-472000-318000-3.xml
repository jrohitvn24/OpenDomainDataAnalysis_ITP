		<title>03STREET &amp; CATTLE MARKET</title>
		<content> The street market dates from at least 
 1086 when it was mentioned in the     
 Domesday Book and has probably been   
 held on a Tuesday for the last 1000   
 years.                                
                                       
 The market is not so important as it  
 used to be, but markets are still held
 on Tuesdays &amp; Saturdays in the Market 
 Place &amp; nearby streets.               
                                       
 The cattle market is also held on a   
 Tuesday &amp; is the largest in the East  
 Midlands.                             
                                       
 Melton Mowbray's early growth was due 
 to its importance as a market centre. 
 Back in the middle of the 19th century
 Melton Mowbray had five annual fairs.
