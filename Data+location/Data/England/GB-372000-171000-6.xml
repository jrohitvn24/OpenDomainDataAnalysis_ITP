		<title>06DOYNTON VILLAGE,COLD ASHTON</title>
		<content>     In 1086, Didintone was the        
 farmstead or TUN of one Dydda. Through
 the centuries to 1986 it has become   
{Doynton,}the homestead of about 350   
 people. Some work in the village but  
 others have to journey to neighbouring
 cities and towns. Yet there is        
 evidence of{community spirit}- the    
 attractive appearance of one of the   
{best kept villages}in Avon and a      
 plaque to prove it; the playing       
 field with swings for the children and
 a cricket pitch. See the{village hall 
 designed, built and given by          
 C.S.Clarke Esq., in 1937. It is used  
 regularly by associations with a wide 
 appeal - Womens Institute, Young      
 Farmers, Keep Fit, Goat Club. It can  
 be hired for public and private       
 functions. It is also used as a       
 polling station in elections and for  
 Parish Council meetings.              </content>
