		<content> This area does not boast any monuments
 or buildings of outstanding historical
 importance. The church is noteworthy  
 and so is the collection of houses    
 around the mill which bridges the     
{River Pang.}The small village green   
 acts as a focal point, through which a
 road now passes on its way up to the  
 steep slopes of the{Downs}to the      
 north. The village nestling in the    
 shadow of the scarp slope has a       
 distinct, tranquil{'old worldly'}air  
 about it and is only encountered by   
 chance motorists deviating from the   
 main Reading to Newbury road. The     
 oldest house in the village lies next 
 to the green and is a two-storey house
 of thirteenth century age, which still
 contains the original beams.
