		<content> This rural area is poorly provided    
 with public service transport.The bus 
 services do not coincide with working 
 hours so nearly everyone needs a car  
 to get them from home to employment,or
 there is a need for giving lifts, an  
 unofficial taxi service.              
   Taxis are used extensively by those 
 who have no other means of getting    
 into the nearby town  for shopping or 
 connections for travel to major       
 centres,for local surgeries-Doctor,   
 Dentist or the hospital, library or   
 leisure activities.                   
   Occassionally businesses who employ 
 people who live in the Village have to
 provide transport-cars or vans-for the
 employee to commute.
