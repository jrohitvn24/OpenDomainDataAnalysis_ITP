		<title>20LOCAL HISTORY-Public Houses</title>
		<content> We interviewed{Dixie Dean,}(one of the
 senior members of the village), about 
{"Public Houses".}                     
 He was l8 when he first went into a   
 pub and he enjoyed it.  There were    
 many different kinds of entertainment 
 including{crib, cards, billiards,     
{darts and dominoes. }The only thing he
 likes about pubs nowadays is the food.
 He doesn't like the beer pumps and of 
 course the prices.  Dixie Dean's      
 uncle, with a little beer in the      
 bottom of his glass, would say to him 
 "Drink up my boy".  It was bad manners
 to refuse.  But if you could not give 
 him an empty glass back you had to buy
 him another pint.                     
 In the pubs there would be lots of    
 fights about football (especially when
 they were drunk).  Dixie Dean even got
 into a fight himself, in his younger  
 days of course.                       </content>
