		<content>   The Forestry Commission,together    
 with the L.E.A. have developed part of
 the forest for educational use.There  
 is an Information Centre and limited  
 accomodation for use by youth,school  
 and other study groups.               
   Schools make frequent day visits and
 generally use an area close to the    
 Forestry Commission office from where 
 a wide range of habitats can be       
 examined.The main aims are to         
 encourage children to learn about     
 forestry as an important industry and 
 to use the man-made environment to    
 learn about ecology.A helpful teachers
 guide is available.Children from all  
 over the North East of England visit  
 the forest for a general insight or to
 make specific studies,such as stream  
 or fungi.The potential for educational
 use is wide in such a stimulating     
 environment.                          </content>
