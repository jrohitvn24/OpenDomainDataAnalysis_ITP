		<title>04Devil's Den, Fyfield.</title>
		<content> There is an old superstition that     
 Devil's Den was an altar on which wild
 haired druids made offerings of human 
 sacrifice.                            
 There are several local tales about   
 the stones. The first tells of the {  
{devil}arriving at midnight driving    
 eight white oxen. They try to pull    
 down the stones, but in vain.         
 Meanwhile a white rabbit sits watching
 high on the cross stone. Its eyes glow
 like fiery coals.                     
 Secondly, there is a belief that if   
 water is poured into the hollows in   
 the cross stone at night, a {demon}   
 will come and drain away the water    
 before morning.                       
 Some say that walking anticlockwise   
 three times round the stone will make 
 the devil appear before your closed   
 eyes, and walking round five times    
 results in a lady becoming pregnant.  </content>
