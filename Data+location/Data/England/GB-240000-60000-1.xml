		<content> LANDULPH SCHOOL BLOCK, E. CORNWALL.   
                                       
 The block designated for this school  
 consists mainly of agricultural land  
 situated on the west bank of the River
 Tamar, up river from Saltash. The     
 boundaries of the block extend from   
 the river bank on which is situated   
 the village of Cargreen, to Ellbridge 
 which lies between Saltash and        
 Callington. The land in between is    
 given over to dairy farming and market
 gardening. The village of Cargreen is 
 a dormitory suburb for the City of    
 Plymouth. The school accommodates     
 approximately 85 children drawn from  
 the villages of Hatt (outside the     
 block) Botus Fleming, Cargreen and    
 other parts of Landulph Parish.
