		<title>12LOCAL HISTORY - SULLINGTON</title>
		<content> Sullington was first called           
 Syling-tun, meaning farmstead by miry 
 place.  About thirty different        
 spellings followed including          
 Semlintun, Shylington, Sylyngton,     
 Solington and Sullingg.  Several      
 groups of Bronze Age tumuli are in    
 this area.  Years ago two were opened 
 and inside each was a sepulchral urn  
 of unbaked clay containing burnt      
 bones. Both urns had different designs
 and a small bronze awl was found.     
 Over the years hundreds of arrow      
 shaped heads of early weapons, plus   
 Roman swords and spearheads have also 
 been found.   Earthwork remains of a  
 Roman Hill Camp and a field system of 
 terraces can be clearly seen.         
 Several cross dykes on the higher part
 of the Downs were used for driving the
 Southdown sheep to market.
