		<title>16COVEN OUTDOOR CENTRE</title>
		<content>This outdoor education centre is run by
the Staffordshire County Council for   
the use of schools in the county,but   
due to popular demand the facilities   
are now available for use by organised 
groups at the warden's discretion.It is
a very popular venue for local scout   
and guide troops.The centre extends    
over 24 acres,about half of which is   
woodland with ponds.The Staffordshire  
and Worcestershire canal forms one of  
the boundaries.The site lends itself to
a very wide variety of activities      
including pioneering,backwoods cooking,
map and compass work,canoeing,plaster- 
casting and tracking,etc.The assault   
course is always popular with the boys.
Most groups camp out but dormitory     
facilities are available, with toilets,
showers,hot water and a kitchen.
