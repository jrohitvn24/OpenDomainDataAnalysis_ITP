 The road winds down into the village  
 of Ragdale from Hoby, twisting its way
 between the collection of red brick   
 houses, some old and some recently    
 built, and climbs sharply up the other
 side of the valley towards the area   
 known as Six Hills.                   
                                       
 In the centre of the village there is 
 a large farm whose owner has a herd of
 pedigree charolais cattle.  They can  
 be seen grazing on the pasture above  
 the farm.                             
                                       
 There are no pubs or shops in the     
 village and no school or bus service. 
 Residents are either farmers or       
 commuters who work in nearby towns and
 cities.
