		<title>05Transport - Historical</title>
		<content> The earliest form of transport was on 
 foot and there are a number of        
 footpaths in Chertsey. They are most  
 noticeable on open spaces such as     
 Chertsey Meads.Towing paths are       
 present along the banks of the River  
 Thames and River Wey. This and the    
 locks indicates that the river is     
 navigable. The Wey Navigation reaches 
 to Cox's Lock Mill and was used       
 commercially a few years ago, but is  
 now used for recreation. Some of these
 waterways are owned by the National   
 Trust.                                
 Many street names in Chertsey         
 originate from the old coaching routes
 from London, to Windsor and           
 Guildford. Many of these used the pubs
 as hostelries.
