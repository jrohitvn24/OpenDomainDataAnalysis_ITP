		<title>17A day in the life</title>
		<content>{(Wednesday)}At 8.30am my friend calls 
 for me and we walk to the swimming    
 pool.We arrive at about 8.55am. The   
 swimming lesson lasts for half an     
 hour, then we go to school on a coach.
 At school we read until break. Up till
 lunch  break we do Maths or English.  
 Then we have our lunch. After lunch we
 do project work, that's the first     
 lesson. For the second, and final,    
 lesson we write a story or do art, for
 art and story we are sometimes given a
 subject. Then we go home. For the rest
 of the day we can do what we like.    
 Here are some of the things we do     
 after school: Play with friends, watch
 television, go riding bicycles or     
 rollerskating, and do hobbies.
