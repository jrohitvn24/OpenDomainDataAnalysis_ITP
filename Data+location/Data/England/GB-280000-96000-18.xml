		<title>18GUNSTONE MILL DAIRY FARM</title>
		<content> On Tuesday the 16th July we went to   
 Gunstone Mill,it is about 6 kilometres
 away from school.When we got there we 
 met Mr Bickley who owns the farm.First
 we looked at Gunstone bridge which is 
 built over the River Yeo.In the winter
 the river sometimes floods and there  
 are some marsh areas .Then we went    
 into see the old mill and now  Mr     
 Bickley keeps all  of his hay ready   
 for the winter, it is dry and         
 sheltered in there.One room is where  
 cows are kept in winter (20 in all).  
  We looked down and we saw the place  
 where water came through to work the  
 mill.Then Mr Bickley came he showed us
 inside the mill and where he blocked  
 up the hole in the wall.There used to 
 be two big water wheels in the barn   
 because the mill was powerd by        
 water.The mill was mainly for grinding
 barley.                               </content>
