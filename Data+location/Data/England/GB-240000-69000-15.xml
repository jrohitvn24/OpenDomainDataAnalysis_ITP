		<content>     Gunnislake, Delaware, Harrowbarrow
 and Calstock  Village  Schools  opened
 around  1875  and  have  been  in  the
 same management group until this year,
 and, Gunnislake and  Harrowbarrow  are
 still  using  the  original buildings,
 constructed from local granite.       
    Originally  children  aged  9 or 10
 left  school  to work  in the mines or
 on farms.  Later, those, who failed to
 obtain places in  the  Grammar schools
 at  Callington  or Tavistock, remained
 until they were 14.                   
    In 1940  a  Secondary Modern School
 was built  at  Delaware  to  take  the
 older children.  In  1971,  Callington
 became a Comprehensive School  and all
 children  over 11  are now transported
 there  by  coach.   Delaware   Primary
 School   moved    into   the   vacated
 Secondary Modern building  and the old
 School is now an Adventure Centre.    </content>
