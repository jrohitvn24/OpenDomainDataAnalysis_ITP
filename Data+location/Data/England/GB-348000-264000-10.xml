		<title>10A SCHOOLBOY'S WEDNESDAY</title>
		<content> I wake up in the morning at           
 approximately 6.00 a.m. I lie in bed  
 for about an hour because my mum      
 usually tells me off if I get up      
 before 7.15. Around then I get up, get
 dressed and go downstairs. I let my   
 dog (Sproggle) out and go into the the
 kitchen. I make two slices of toast   
 for mum. When I've had my breakfast I 
 go back upstairs and brush my teeth,  
 get washed, go to the toilet and brush
 my hair.By that time it is 8.00 so mum
 and I put Sproggle in the boot of the 
 car and drive to Stockton Cross which 
 is where we meet Anthony and Will and 
 Michael, who we share lifts with. We  
 swap from my car to one of the other  
 cars and drive to Orleton School. I   
 get there about 8.43 and the bell for 
 the beginning of school goes at 8.40. 
 For the first lesson we have assembly.
 Then we do maths until 10.30, playtime</content>
