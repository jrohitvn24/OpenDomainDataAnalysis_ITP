		<content>{John Symons }has been attending the { 
{Marsh Lane Centre }for three          
 years.Multiple Sclerosis first        
 affected him in 1976 when he started  
 to limp and had to use a walking      
 stick.Gradually he was forced to use  
 two sticks and by 1980 couldn't walk  
 at all.In 1983 he stopped driving.He  
 has a ground floor extension built on 
 his house which has a bedroom and     
 bathroom.He can't take part in the    
 activities at the centre because he is
 unable to use his hands without       
 holding them steady.{Mr. Symons }is   
 the centre's coordinator and makes    
 sure the disabled people receive their
 correct allowances.He finds that there
 aren't adequate facilities for        
 disabled people but does noy feel     
 discriminated against.Attending the   
 centre keeps his mind busy and he goes
 there each day.                       </content>
