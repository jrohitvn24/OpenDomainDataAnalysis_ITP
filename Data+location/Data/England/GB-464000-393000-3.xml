		<title>03The Phoenix Theatre Bawtry</title>
		<content>  The Phoenix Theatre in Bawtry was    
 built in 1862 as a chapel. At the     
 front there are the original two      
 windows and door although they are not
 now used. The entrance to the building
 is now at the side.                   
  Inside there are 72 seats which came 
 from a cinema in London. They were old
 and torn so five pounds was paid to   
 have them re_upholstered. A plate on  
 the seat back gives the contributor's 
 name. The auditorium, the original    
 chapel, has brown walls while the     
 ceiling of the stage, a recent        
 addition, is black. The extension was 
 opened in April 1983 and houses the   
 stage and wings,a small kitchen above 
 which is an even smaller dressing room
 with mirrors and lights. Leading from 
 this is a tiny lighting gallery       
 controlling two circuits of spot and  
 flood lights.                         </content>
