		<title>06Chair Caning</title>
		<content> My name is Penny Trayler. I live at   
 Frostenden in Suffolk. My Dad works as
 achair caner. He does rush chairs,    
 cane chairs and sea-grass chairs. My  
 mum helps him and so does Sue Elvin.  
 About every three weeks he goes and   
 drops some chairs off and sometimes he
 collects them. Occasionally he does   
 chairs for antique dealers. He has    
 done a chair for Princess Ann and for 
 Lulu. He is self-employed.            
   He started at the age of 16 and     
 taught himself. Sometimes there are no
 broken chairs and work is scarce.     
   Our Grandad was a milkman so Dad    
 thought he was going to be a milkman  
 but I'm glad he wasn't.  I don't know 
 where he gets his reeds and rushes    
 from but a big lorry delivers them.   
                        Penny Trayler.
