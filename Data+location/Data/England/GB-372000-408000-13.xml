		<title>13A MINK FARM</title>
		<content>                                       
 We visited a Mink Farm, one of only   
 sixty in the British Isles. Mink are  
 expensive so the farmer keeps         
 Rottweilers as guard dogs  to stop    
 Animal Rights supporters stealung or  
 releasing animals.One escaped Mink    
 could kill 40-50 hens in one night and
 could also kill domestic pets. Mink   
 look like cute stoats, but they are   
 extremely fierce. The farmer keeps    
 three kinds dark, pastel and wild     
 mink. All the skins produced are sold 
 by auction at the Hudson Bay Company. 
 The skins need to be matched carefully
 as it needs about 50 skins to make one
 coat. Not many people even know the   
 mink farm is there because there is no
 noise and not much smell. It is a very
 well kept farm.
