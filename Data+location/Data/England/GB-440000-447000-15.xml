		<content>  The new{A1}trunk road sounds good to 
 some and bad to others. Owners {think}
 they have lost value on their houses; 
 estimates varied from Â£500-Â£7000; but 
 they still think that they can sell   
 their homes at a reasonable price. It 
 seems the ends of some gardens are    
 going to be cut off, so greenhouses,  
 sheds etc., are going to have to be   
 moved. At least four owners will be so
 affected. For most people safety is   
 not a major concern. Occupants said   
 that they might install double glazing
 if the noise is bad, but if the noise 
 isn't too bad then there is no point, 
 so most were going to wait and see.   
 Most of the people asked, thought that
 the road was necessary, even though   
 many who were asked did not know much 
 about it, despite information in local
 newspapers.
