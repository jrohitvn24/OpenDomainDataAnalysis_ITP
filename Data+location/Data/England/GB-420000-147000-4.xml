		<title>04THE ARMED FORCES IN TIDWORTH</title>
		<content>  Tidworth has had a military presence 
 since 1903 when the first barracks    
 were built. At that time there were   
 four Cavalry and four Infantry        
 barracks and whilst many of the main  
 buildings remain today extensive      
 rebuilding is planned. The 1920's saw 
 more troops coming into the area and  
 the facilities were improved. Today's 
 Garrison comprises the HQ 1st Infantry
 Brigade,two Armoured Regiments,an     
 Engineer Regiment and two Infantry    
 Battalions. They are supported by     
 units of the RAMC,RAOC,REME,RMP,RAEC, 
 RADC and RPC. Units from Tidworth go  
 on detachment to Northern Ireland,    
 Cyprus and the Falkland Islands. Many 
 exercises take place on Salisbury     
 Plain and the training areas around   
 Tidworth but soldiers may also go to  
 other parts of the United Kingdom or  
 abroad to Germany,Denmark or Norway.  </content>
