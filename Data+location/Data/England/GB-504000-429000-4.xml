		<title>04HULL FAIR, 2.</title>
		<content> Hull Fair is held every year at Walton
 Street. It starts on a Saturday       
 morning at eleven o'clock and finishes
 at midnight on the following Saturday.
 Sometimes on a Wednesday night some of
 the rides and stalls are a bit        
 cheaper. There are lots of stalls and 
 rides, and lots of food to eat (e.g.  
 fish and chips). Every year there are 
 dodgems and "Hook a Duck" stalls. On  
 the Dodgems you try to steer a car    
 without hitting any other cars.       
   On the "Hook a Duck" stalls you get 
 a rod and you have to hook a plastic  
 duck. If you succeed in the challenge 
 you win a prize (e.g. a yoyo, a       
 keyring or a pack of playing cards)   
 but if you do not hook a duck you may 
 receive a booby prize (e.g. a massive 
 Â£10.00 note).
