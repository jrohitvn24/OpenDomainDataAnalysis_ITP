		<content> There is{no speed limit}in Rusper but 
 they have signs up to say{"Please     
{drive slowly".}The main road through  
 the village is used as an alternative 
 route to Gatwick and London.{Car      
{parking}is a problem;The Star public  
 house has a carpark which can be used 
 if the owner says so,and there is a   
 new carpark next to the church.Most of
 the newer private houses have         
 garages,but the council property and  
 older houses do not.The roads are busy
 at rush hour and mid-day.They are also
 narrow and badly lit.There is no bus  
 stop in the village,but a {bus }which 
 goes to Horsham,stops outside " The   
 Plough".It runs twice a day.The       
 nearest branchline station is at      
 Faygate. It is difficult to travel    
 unless you own a{private car}.In      
 Rusper there is no longer a petrol    
 station,only a repair garage.         </content>
