		<content>The two main supermarkets in Didcot are
Co-op and Keymarkets.  Creaks is a     
small supermarket, but is very popular.
Just 3/4 hour after it opened about 250
people had been in!  One Christmas they
were able to give the staff's children 
a party with customers' goodwill gifts.
Keymarkets have about 80-90 staff.  It 
is open six days a week at present.    
However Mr Chilburs, the Manager thinks
that a year from now all shops will be 
open seven days.  Mr Stones from the   
Co-op said that, although he did not   
know the average number of customers   
per day, they did quite well.  Food    
shopping facilities are sufficient in  
Didcot, although many people do travel 
six miles to Tesco in Abingdon.  It is 
noticeable that few people from nearby 
towns shop in Didcot.                  
There are four main clothes shops.  In 
Notag and Bugsy Malone the most common </content>
