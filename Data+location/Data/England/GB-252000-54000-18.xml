 children from Glen Park Primary School
 performed a gymnastic display for the 
{Lord Mayor }and {Lady Mayoress. }Carla
 Whittingham, age 11, presented a      
 bouquet of flowers to the Lady        
 Mayoress.                             
   The children combined various       
 movements such as foreward rolls,     
 cartwheels, headsprings, handsprings, 
 walk overs and arab springs, moving   
 along a row of mats.                  
   They used a vaulting box to show    
 side vaults, headsprings, handsprings 
 through and straddle vaults.          
   The girls performed their floor     
 routines to music and included many   
 skills they had learned in school     
 gymnastics lessons and at gymnastics  
 club.
