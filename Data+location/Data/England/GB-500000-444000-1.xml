		<title>01Scorborough and Arram</title>
		<content>  This area is sparsely populated.     
 There are 2 villages, Scorborough and 
 Arram, and several scattered farms.   
 The land is flat and mainly used for  
 arable farming. There are large       
 glasshouses at Arram for horticultural
 crops. A few sheep and cattle (beef   
 and dairy) are grazed in the area.    
 Horses are kept for recreation. There 
 are many small copses of trees which  
 provide cover for game birds. In the  
 extreme south of the area is part of  
 the Army School of Mechanical         
 Transport, Leconfield. the villages   
 are a little way off the A164 road    
 linking the 2 market towns of Beverley
 and Driffield. Most people are        
 employed in agriculture, horticulture 
 or related jobs. Primary school age   
 children from Scorborough go to       
 Lockington school and from Arran they 
 go to Leconfield school.              </content>
