		<title>07Industrial Estate, Alcester</title>
		<content>      The Arden Forest Industrial      
 Estate is not very large and the      
 factories are not very big. There are 
 31 factories and the number of people 
 employed ranges from 150 to one man   
 who works by himself. He is working up
 his own business. The average number  
 of people employed is 32. All the     
 factories together employ 1054 people,
 many of them from Alcester.Some of    
 these work in their own homes, being  
 employed as outworkers.               
      Many of the units are light      
 engineering works, but a few are      
 storage depots or give a service of   
 some sort.                            
      There are areas of wasteland     
 round the factory estate which will   
 probably be built on one day. We saw a
 factory being built from prefabricated
 materials and it seemed to take no    
 time to erect.                        </content>
