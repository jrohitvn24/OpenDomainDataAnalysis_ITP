		<content> Colerne has an annual event called the
 Colerne May Fayre. This has been going
 for twelve years. They always have a  
 May Queen and her attendants. To      
 choose the May Queen and her          
 attendants for the May Fayre you put  
 your name down and then you pull out a
 name from a hat, then that person is  
 the May Queen. There is also a fancy  
 dress competition, there are four age 
 groups. They also have floats, this   
 year(1985) there were ten floats. The 
 winner had made a big Steam Train. It 
 normally takes place on the third     
 weekend in May.                       
                                       
 As an extra event this year some of   
 the children involved in this survey  
 performed a set of stick dances. It is
 hoped that this will stay as a        
 traditional event.
