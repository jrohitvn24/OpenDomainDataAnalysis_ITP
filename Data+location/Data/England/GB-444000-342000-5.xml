		<title>05THE COTMANHAY B.M.X. PROJECT</title>
		<content>{The B.M.X. track}was built in 1984 at 
 a cost of Â£4000.{The Ilson Gunners}   
 B.M.X. club race there. They hold     
 meetings every three weeks. Members   
 pay Â£l.50 to race. At every meeting   
 the St. John's Ambulance Brigade are  
 there in case of accidents. Before you
 start you take your bike to be        
 checked. You have to wear a helmet and
 gloves.                               
{Sometimes the Committee}holds a       
 meeting. They ask you what faults are 
 in the track and how to improve it. It
 is quite a good track, but if it rains
 it gets swampy. They have changed the 
 track a lot since they built it. There
 is a new starting gate, they have     
 added new jumps and a new turn.       
{At Christmas the Ilson Gunners}hold a 
 party for all the club and team       
 members.
