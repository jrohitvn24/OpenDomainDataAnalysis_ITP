		<title>18FLORA-THE FINEST PRIMROSES</title>
		<content> There is an abundance of spring       
 flowers in this area-in woods, shaws  
 and on banks along roadsides. There   
 are blue bells,primroses, wood        
 anemones, ramsons, wood sorrel and in 
 the damp places, golden saxifrage. The
 hedges are a mixture of many species  
 interwined with hop, bryony,          
 blackberry and honeysuckle. Under the 
 hedges the finest primroses grow in   
 profusion and on the verges cuckoo    
 flowers and celandines thrive. In May 
 the lanes are lined with cow parsely  
 followed by hogweed in July - in      
 August fleabane and hemp agrimony. Not
 much natural pasture remains as most  
 fields have been ploughed at some time
 but there is one small hayfield in    
 June that has ragged robin, moon      
 daisies, yellow rattle,               
 buttercups,sorrel and grasses - a     
 precious site.                        </content>
