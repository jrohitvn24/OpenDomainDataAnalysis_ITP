		<title>12SPONSORED WALKS, BEDGEBURY</title>
		<content>   One form of fund-raising for charity
 or self-help is the sponsored event.  
 This is usually a walk, for which the 
 walkers seek "sponsorships" of a few  
 pence per mile walked, but may also be
 a horse or cycle ride, run, swim, etc.
   Bedgebury is a particularly suitable
 area for sponsored walks and rides,   
 having many public rights of way, both
 footpaths and bridleways, including   
 several through the Forest.           
   Bedgebury School and others have    
 held local sponsored walks or rides   
 for such charities as Guide Dogs for  
 the Blind, Kent Orphans, Riding for   
 the Disabled, World Wildlife and      
 Cancer Research, and also for their   
 own amenities such as a chapel organ. 
   These events combine exercise,      
 pleasure and charity but need careful 
 organisation; the police and Ramblers'
 Association can give helpful advice.  </content>
