		<title>12A DAY IN THE LIFE OF FIONA</title>
		<content> The rain was pouring down outside.    
 "Typical English weather!"I thought as
  I pulled myself yawning out of bed.  
 After breakfast, Weetabix, toast &amp;    
 tea,  Dad dropped me off at school in 
 the car.                              
 I ran into school getting soaking     
 wet.After doing 8 a day our group did 
 computer Maths.                       
 When we had wandered round the cold,  
 wet playground we wrote a poem about  
 the months, before  we marked our 8 a 
 day.At Dinnertime we had beefburgers, 
 chips &amp; baked beans, followed by      
 cheesecake.After Dinner I did a       
 collage.We went to Y.O.C. after       
 school and painted some birds.Kate,   
 Francesca,Charlotte and I went to     
 Brighouse Light Opera Juniors to      
 practise for our show.In the evening  
 we played Rounders at Guides.
