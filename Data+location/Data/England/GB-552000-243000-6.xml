		<content> Not so long ago Mrs.Dawson was asked  
 to lock up the church every evening at
 about  nine o'clock.  After a few     
 nights of looking after the church    
 Mrs.Dawson started hearing noises     
 that sounded like footsteps so she    
 began to start taking her dog to the  
 church to lock up and, strangely, her 
 dog began to bark every night at      
 around nine o'clock and every night   
 the footsteps seemed to be getting    
 louder so she asked her friend to come
 and see if she could hear the         
 footsteps but when her friend came she
 could not hear anything, so Mrs.Dawson
 called in a man who dealt with this   
 sort of thing and he said that it was 
 not a ghost it was just a force of    
 habit that could not be stopped.      
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
