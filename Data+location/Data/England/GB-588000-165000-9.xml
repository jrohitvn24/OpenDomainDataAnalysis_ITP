		<content> In this area it is not difficult to   
 escape from the residential areas to  
 the countryside in a matter of minutes
 The parishes of Iwade and Bobbing are 
 latticed with a maze of footpaths and 
 these are kept open  by the Swale     
 Footpaths Group who regularly walk    
 them to ensure they are kept open and 
 not blocked. The closeness of the area
 to the estuary marshes of the Thames  
 and Medway rivers provide a wide      
 variety of bird life. Local farmers   
 who keep weather records tell us that 
 the rainfall of the area is below the 
 national average, while the sunshine  
 is more. In winter the area is hit by 
 a biting easterly wind which blows in 
 from the north sea. There is a claim  
 that the area suffers from pollution  
 from the smell eminating in Milton    
 Creek, and the fumes from the car     
 breaking plant at Ridham Dock.        </content>
