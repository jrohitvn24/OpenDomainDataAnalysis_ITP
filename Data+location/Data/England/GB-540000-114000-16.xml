		<title>16A PUPIL'S DAY.</title>
		<content>{A Report by Kim Saunders              
 I got up about 8.00am, got dressed and
 had my breakfast.This was a slice of  
 toast and a cup of tea.Then I got     
 ready for school.My dad put my bike in
 the trailer of his car,so that I could
 cycle home,and then he took me to     
 school.If it looked like rain he      
 said he would come and pick me up.When
 I got to school I put my bike with all
 the other children's.I hung my bag and
 coat up in the cloakroom and then     
 went into the playground until the    
 bell rang.When it did,I went into the 
 classroom and did some English until  
 we finished registration and went to  
 assembly. Mr.Yeomans our class teacher
 read a story and then we sang"Praise  
 the Lord".We went back to class and   
 read and did English until it was time
 for break.After break we did          
 mathematics until our swimming period.</content>
