		<title>10Leisure In South Clifton 2</title>
		<content> If people wish to go swimming they    
 have to travel to either The North    
 Kesteven Pool,North Hykeham or        
 Gainsborough Pool.Once again they have
 to provide their own transport.Men and
 boys can be found on the banks of the 
 Trent indulging in their hobby of     
 fishing.In the season there is also a 
 large amount of game shooting and     
 hunting.The local Public House in     
 South Clifton boasts a darts team     
 which plays in the local league.It is 
 also a meeting place for the villagers
 to chat over a glass of beer. A mobile
 library provided by Notts CC visits   
 the village once a fortnight which is 
 well patronised.Many people spend time
 in gardening,both vegetables and      
 flowers.A Produce Show is held in     
 August to encourage this.Other hobbies
 include restoring old cars,spinning,  
 steamengines and choral singing.      </content>
