		<title>08INDUSTRY IN LINTON</title>
		<content>   Linton is noted for its lack of     
 industry,but we found the following:  
 Cathodeon Crystals is thirty years    
 old.They make quartz crystals which   
 are posted to their buyers.The raw    
 materials come from America.They      
 employ about 160 workers,who work for 
 8 hours a day.                        
   Paintins get their raw materials    
 from a place called Bradnems.They get 
 marble for memorials from Hull.They   
 make coffins,which are transported in 
 vans and lorries.                     
   The model shop in Linton makes model
 Navy Warships.Materials come from     
 Saffron Walden.One of the workmen said
 his job was very interesting.When they
 are finished,the buyers collect them. 
 10 people work there from 8-9 hours.  
   There is also a printing works.
