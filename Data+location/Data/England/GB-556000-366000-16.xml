		<title>16Skegness Aerodrome</title>
		<content> The Skegness Aerodrome is on the A52  
 road between Butlin's Camp and        
 Ingoldmells village.It was built in   
 1948 and was part of Butlin's.They    
 gave pleasure flights to the campers, 
 so it was a great attraction.In 1951  
 Skegness Air Taxi Service took over.  
 They formed an Aero Club which gave   
 flying lessons.They still own it.     
 Sometimes they do an aerial crop      
 inspection and check that there are no
 power lines broken or gas pipes being 
 ploughed up.Also besides aerial photo-
 graphy they do a taxi service.  For   
 instance to go to Manchester costs    
 Â£180.When Class 4 went to visit the   
 airfield we saw the plane which tows  
 the advertising banner.It was in the  
 hanger together with some privately   
 owned aircraft.The fire tender was    
 standing ready in case of accidents.  
 A helicopter landed and took off.     </content>
