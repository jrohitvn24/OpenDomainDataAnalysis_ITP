		<content> In Chinley the textile industry hosts 
 Dorma, which produces bed covers and  
 blinds and pillow cases. Dorma belongs
 to the Vantona-Viyella Group, but     
 produces its own branded goods.       
    Dorma uses water from the Otter    
 brook to be part of the dye and puts  
 the remainder of the dye (after use)  
 back into the river! Some days the    
 Black Brook is the colour its name    
 suggests, while at other times it can 
 be grey, green or even bright purple! 
 This pollution is unsightly, but it   
 doesn't seem to harm the wildlife.    
    Further up the road and to the     
 right is the old Tramway. Follow this 
 and up the road to the right and you  
 come to Bernard Wardles, which        
 produces bedroom utilities such as    
 duvets.
