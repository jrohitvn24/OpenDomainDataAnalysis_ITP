		<content>   Dale Electric was founded in 1935   
 by Leonard Dale C.B.E.When electricity
 was connected to the village he lost  
 interest in the family milk business  
 and decided that his future lay with  
 the new industry.From a start wiring  
 small cottages and farms the factory  
 has become Britain's most consistent  
 exporter of diesel-powered generating 
 sets.                                 
   The company employs three hundred   
 staff,of which 60% are skilled,39%    
 semi-skilled and 1% unskilled.It      
 provides employment for               
 Filey,Scarborough and Bridlington and 
 the opportunity of training,further   
 education and apprenticships,eight of 
 which are offered in                  
 electro-mechanical engineering per    
 year.There is also the possibility of 
 the candidate continuing their studies
 at university under sponsorship.      </content>
