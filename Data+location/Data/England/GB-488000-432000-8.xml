		<title>08STREAM PATH TO N..CAVE MILL</title>
		<content>    My favourite walk is by the church 
 just across from my house.   The walk 
 (ref.898328) takes you just past a    
 stream by an old mill and up through  
 two lines of bushes right onto the    
 footpath of Church Street, North Cave.
 Things to look out for on the walk are
 fishes with red spots on their backs. 
 Before I reach the mill pond and the  
 site of the water wheel there is a    
 special tree shaped like a chair.     
 This is where the mill race separates 
 from the main stream.  A good idea is 
 to rest in the "chair" if you are     
 tired of walking and just watch the   
 sandy-bedded stream and the water     
 running by.   Sometimes, after rain, I
 see the occasional frog wallowing in  
 the wet mud.                          
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
