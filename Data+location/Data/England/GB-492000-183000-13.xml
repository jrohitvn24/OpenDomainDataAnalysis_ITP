		<title>13LONG CLOSE</title>
		<content>Around 1800 a huge house was built     
called "Long Close".The owner of the   
house travelled abroad a lot.He brought
specimen trees.He planted the trees    
around his estate.Around the 1900's the
house was made into a Prep School      
called "Long Close School",in 1950 the 
school was moved to Slough.A pupil in  
our class used to attend the new Long  
Close School in Slough.                
In 1960 new houses were built on the   
site of the old School because it had  
to be pulled down.All the trees        
preservation orders put on them.So the 
builders had to work around them,though
a few trees were Knocked down          
"accidentally" on purpose.             
We spoke to a lady who lives in "Long  
Close".In her front garden is a giant  
wellingtonia tree,a cousin of the      
Giant red wood tree.It has grown to a  
huge size,but she can't cut it down.   </content>
