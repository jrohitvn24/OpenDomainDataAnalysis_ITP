		<title>14POLICE AND CRIME.</title>
		<content>   In Southwold there are seven        
 police-men and women working full     
 time.The station is responsible for   
 Reydon as well.It is open to the      
 public between{10am}to{11am}and{6.30pm
 to{7.30pm}every day but has to be     
 closed otherwise owing to the small   
 number of work-force.Dogs are         
 available,but none are kept on the    
 premises.                             
   The main crimes in the area are:    
 speeding,drunken driving,and robbery_ 
 owing to its being a rich area.Those  
 offending are tried on the{Beccles    
{Petty Sessional Division Bench}where  
 fifteen magistrates sit. Punishments  
 range from fines-for speeding-to      
 imprisonment for robbery.Although     
 there is relatively high unemploy-    
 ment there is no trouble caused by the
 unemployed.Although Southwold is on   
 the coast,there is no smuggling.      </content>
