		<title>09NEWBIGGIN SPORTS CENTRE</title>
		<content>{    NEWBIGGIN  SPORTS CENTRE}WAS BUILT
 IN 1973. IT WAS THE FIRST CENTRE TO BE
 OPENED IN THE AREA AT THE TIME. THE   
 COUNCIL DECIDED THAT THE  UNEMPLOYED  
 WOULD HAVE LOTS OF SPARE TIME AND SO  
{LEISURE}WOULD BECOME AS VALUABLE AS   
 WORK IT WOULD BE NICE IF NEWBIGGIN    
 HAD A SWIMMING POOL.IT WOULD MAKE A   
 DIFFERENES TO NEWBIGGIN BECAUSE MORE  
 MONEY WOULD BE COMEING IN AND PEOPLE  
 WOULD LEARN TO SWIM.MANY PEOPLE       
 TRAVELLED TO NEWBIGGIN BUT WITH THE   
 COST OF TRAVELLING AND OHTER CENTRES  
 BEING BUILT THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE      
 TRAVELLING DROPPED.THERE IS STILL A   
 NUMBER OF PEOPLE TRAVELLING TO        
 NEWBIGGIN FROM LYNEMOUTH AND ELLINGTON
 BECAUSE THEY HAVE NOT GOT A CENTRE    
 THERE.THE OLD PEOPLE HAVE MEETINGS    
 TWICE A WEEK IN THE FUNCTION HALL AND 
 THE{DISABLED}USE THE SPORTS CENTRE    
 FOR DARTS,POOL,AND BOWLS.             </content>
