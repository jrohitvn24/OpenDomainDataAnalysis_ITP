		<title>13Maldon and Shopping</title>
		<content>    Many people in Maldon and the      
 surrounding villages do their main    
 weekly shopping in the town itself.   
 With its narrow, winding High Street  
 and the many small shops strung out   
 along its length it is in many ways a 
 very pleasant old market town in which
 to shop.But many people had criticisms
 of Maldon as a place to do shopping.  
 1) There are few car parks and the    
 charges some felt are exhorbitant.    
 2){Maldon Hill}acts as a deterrent to 
 those approaching the town from the   
 direction of Heybridge.               
 3) There are no large shops or        
 supermarkets and some felt that better
 bargains could be had in Chelmsford or
 Colchester.                           
 4) Maldon is a small town which can   
 quickly become packed with people.    
 5) Its narrow and winding streets make
 it dangerous for pedestrians.         </content>
