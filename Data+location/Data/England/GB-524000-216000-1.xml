 about 40 kilometres from London.It is

 main railway line from Kings Cross,the
 A1 motorway, and the B197, which is   
 the old A1.                           
 Datchworth is a large spread out      
 village set in rural surroundings,    
 Woolmer Green is smaller and on each  
 side of the B197, while Oaklands is a 
 much newer,growing area of good       
 quality housing.                      
 There are schools in all three areas, 
 and small shops for local shopping.   
 Garages are situated on the main road,
 and all three areas have their quota  
 of pubs.
