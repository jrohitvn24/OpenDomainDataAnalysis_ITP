		<content> With the plain of York to the south   
 and the Howardian Hills to the north, 
 this area consists of undulating farm 
 lands plus a small amount of park land
 and woods.Due to alterations of       
 farming practice the natural history  
 has changed-hedges and old oaks have  
 been cut down in the last ten         
 years.Flaura and fauna are now of the 
 more common type,in odd places rarer  
 flowers-cowslips and yellow rattle are
 found.Birds have adopted a new habitat
 in the well tended village gardens but
 bats and owls still remain around the 
 village.                              
 Conservation of the park land oaks was
 ignored by one owner resulting in     
 great change when these old trees were
 felled in 1979.25 acres were planted  
 under a dedicated woodland scheme in  
 1977,this is situated between the     
 pond and park house.                  </content>
