		<title>02Nunsthorpe housing estate.</title>
		<content> The{Nunsthorpe}housing estate is a    
 large{council}estate.It was built over
 a number of years.The first houses on 
 the estate were built in{1925,}and the
 rest of the estate was gradually      
 developed up until the present date.  
 New houses are still being built on   
 the edge of the existing estate.A very
 large new private housing estate to be
 called{Scartho Top}is to be developed 
 to the south of{Nunsthorpe.}          
      Our school was opened in         
{September 1931,}and was originally an 
 all age school, to serve the new      
 housing estate. At one time there were
 over{1,000}children in the school.    
 Today it is just a{Middle school}with 
{348}pupils on roll. Seperate{nursery  
 and{infant}schools have been built on 
 the same site.
