		<content>{Matters arising at Pembury Parish     
{Meeting, held in March, 1985.}        
 The Parish Meetings in Pembury are    
 regular. About 30 people attended this
 one along with some officers from     
 Tunbridge Wells Borough Council and a 
 representative of Kent Constabulary,  
 who gave a talk on the neighbourhood  
 watch scheme to help stop{crime. }    
  There were questions put forward by  
 locals concerning the availability of 
{rubbish}skips and the removal of full 
 ones. Concern was expressed by        
 parishioners that when the by pass is 
 built that people will seek{permission
{to build}on land. Those present wanted
 this resisted. The parishioners also  
 complained about the{state of         
{pavements}during the icy winter. It   
 was made clear that attention was on  
 the roads, and it was up to residents 
 to clear their own paths.             </content>
