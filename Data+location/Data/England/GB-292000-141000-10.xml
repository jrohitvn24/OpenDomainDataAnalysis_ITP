		<title>10Dairy Farming 1.</title>
		<content> This is a large dairy farm of 180acres
 The farmhouse is only about 50 years  
 old and stands beside the River       
 Hanny.Mr.Ball's great grandfather     
 rented the land and bought it in      
 1930,adding Elsworthy land in 1970 and
 2,9acre fields at Cowbridge in 1978.He
 has a herd of 200 Friesian cows and is
 building up a pedigree herd to be     
 known as the Hannaford Herd registered
 with the British Friesian Society.He  
 milks three times a day.The cows give 
 28-30litres of milk a day immediately 
 after calving and go down to as little
 as 10 prior to calving.Of the 180acres
 he uses70 for maize ,70 for grass     
 silage and 40 for pasture.No hay is   
 made and the cows are fed on a mixture
 of maize,silage and molasses all mixed
 in a large machine.It costs Mr.Ball   
 Â£600p.a. to feed a cow.
