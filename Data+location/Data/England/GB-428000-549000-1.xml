		<title>01GREAT LUMLEY - ENVIRONS.</title>
		<content> Mainly east of the Wear,our block is a
 predominantly rural area including the
 extensive woods and parkland of Lumley
 Castle, the  fringes of Lambton Estate
 and the settlements  of  Great Lumley,
 Woodstone  and  Bournmoor.  Our survey
 concentrates  on Great Lumley,as being
 typical of the area and its life.Great
 Lumley is a compact, dormitory village
 of varied amenities,with a farming and
 mining   past. Eastwards, we  find the
 mainly  residential   settlements   of
 Woodstone  and Bournmoor  with pockets
 of industry, a  brickworks  and  solid
 fuel plant.  Lumley's  written history
 predates 1066, going back to the times
 of the Saxon Lord Liulph.  The village
 itself commands a magnificent panorama
 westwards  over the  broad Wear Valley
 to the lower  slopes  of the Pennines,
 and northwards to industrial Tyneside.
