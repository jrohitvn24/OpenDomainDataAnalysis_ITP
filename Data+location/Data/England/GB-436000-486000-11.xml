		<content> We went to Otterington Hall.Miss      
 Furness lives there.She has lived     
 there since 1918.She has got 139      
 acres of farmland. The house and the  
 gardens cover 4 acres.The house has 14
 rooms.She does not use all the        
 rooms.A man called Captain Boss used  
 to own it. He was a member of         
 parliament.There are two workers      
 in the house.She                      
 has one gardner.There is no central   
 heating,so nearly every room has a    
 fireplace in it.Miss Furness breeds   
 horses.She has ten horses,three       
 mares,and two old horses.She breeds   
 Shorthorn cattle.Most of the sheep are
 Suffolk.They have one bull.The bull   
 does not have a ring in it's nose.We  
 saw one cow that was calving.They have
 a broom plantation near the house.
