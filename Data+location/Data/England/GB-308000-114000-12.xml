		<title>12HAMLETS/HOUSES IN CULMSTOCK</title>
		<content>  In this particular area, we have     
 three picturesque HAMLETS, namely,    
 PRESCOTT, NICHOLASHAYNE and WOODGATE. 
 Public footpaths are walked regularly 
 and kept open. The original TITHE BARN
 now houses 4 cottages and GYPSY FARM  
 and OLD BEAT are names surviving from 
 days of SQUATTERS when a house was    
 built and the land on which it stood, 
 and often that surrounding it, were   
 claimed.  Old Beat refers  to burning 
 of scrubland before cultivation took  
 place.                                
 OLD HALL in Prescott is one of the    
 very earliest buildings in the Parish 
 - this is still inhabited and farmed  
 as a smallholding of 15 acres.        
 POND FARM and TUCKER'S FARM at        
 Nicholashayne are self-explanatory (a 
 'tucker' being a labourer in the cloth
 industry), for which Culmstock was a  
 centre.                               </content>
