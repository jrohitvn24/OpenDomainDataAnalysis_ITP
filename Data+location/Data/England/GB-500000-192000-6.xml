		<title>06A Teachers day part 2</title>
		<content>  10.40 and break arrives for both     
 staff and children(except for the     
 teacher on playground duty).After     
 break the pattern is much the same as 
 before with perhaps either T.V. or    
 P.E. depending on the timetable.      
  After lunch(12.00-1.15)the afternoon 
 takes a less formal pattern with      
 project work,art &amp; craft,games or     
 music.                                
  After school at 3.15 I am involved in
 football training(Monday &amp; Thursday)  
 until 4.30 but during the football    
 season matches have also to be fitted 
 in.Apart from football,mounting work, 
 meetings etc.also happen at this time.
  My journey home can start at 4.30 -  
 5.00 and(traffic allowing)I arrive    
 home 30 minutes later.                
  My day ends about 10.30p.m.when,after
 watching T.V. in the evening,I go to  
 bed.                                  </content>
