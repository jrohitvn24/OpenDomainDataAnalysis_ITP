		<title>05Traffic Through Newmillerdam</title>
		<content>   The greatest change to the area has 
 been brought about by motor transport.
 In the past the road from Wakefield to
 Barnsley was travelled by horse drawn 
 carts. Today a lot of traffic now uses
 what is now the A6l trunk road.       
   Despite the nearness of the Ml (less
 than 2 miles to the west) many heavy  
 lorries hurtle through the middle of  
 the area. The problem is made worse   
 because the road bends sharply in the 
 centre of the village to enable it to 
 cross the dam after which the village 
 has been named.                       
   There are no pedestrian crossings in
 the village and on weeek days it is   
 especially difficult to get across the
 road.                                 
   Unfortunately there seems little    
 hope of an improvement if the amount  
 of traffic continues to increase.
