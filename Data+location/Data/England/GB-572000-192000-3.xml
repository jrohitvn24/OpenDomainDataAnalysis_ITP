		<content> In 1951 the population of{Wickford}was
 8000 .This had risen to nearly 22000  
 in 1971 and  over 26000 by 1981. This 
 being despite a falling birth rate and
 a stable death rate. However since    
 1960 between 1000 and 1500 persons per
 year have moved into the district. A  
 survey by the council in 1968 showed  
 that over 60% of houseowners had not  
 been born in the town, compared with  
 37% for the whole of{South Essex.}    
 There is an evenly distributed age    
 structure without any significant     
 peaks putting a strain on services. In
 a class survey of 4th year pupils at  
{Bromfords school,}9 out of 18 had     
 moved to{Wickford}and only one pupil's
 parents were native to the town. 12   
 pupils' parents had moved from London,
 5 from other parts of{Essex}and one   
 from Yorkshire.
