		<content>We asked people from the block how     
they would like to see thier area      
improvd. Two answers kept reoccuring;  
solving the problem of litter, and     
stopping vandalism. There seem to be   
two types of litter affecting the area.
In the residential area it tends to be 
that rubbish that has been carelessly  
thoughtlessly discarded such as food   
wrappers, empty drink cans etc. On the 
rural edge of the block there is more  
deliberate dumping of large items of   
rubbish. To solve the problem people   
wanted offenders to be fined heavily   
more litter bins to be provided and    
littwardens to patrol the area.        
Vandalism worries a lot of people and  
can be mean loss of amenities. Fairway 
School playground was use as a play    
area out of school hours. However      
because of misuse,break-ins,graphtti   
and broken windows it is now closed.   </content>
