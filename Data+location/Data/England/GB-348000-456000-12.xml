		<content> There are three main transport systems
 in our area: M6 motorway, A6 main road
 &amp; railway.  The 6 lane wide M6 was    
 opened 20 years ago and runs N-S.     
 During one hour we counted 666        
 commercial &amp; 642 private vehicles     
 going S with 582 com. &amp; 714 private   
 going N.  The A6 parallels the M6. It 
 carries up to 1,400 cars to the Univ. 
 each week day.  The railway was       
 electrified in 1974.  There are now   
 more passengers because of students   
 travelling to the University.  The    
 speed of the Advanced Passenger Train 
 reaches 125 miles per hour on this    
 stretch.  There are 142 passenger     
 trains and 75 freight trains on this  
 line each week.  The freight trains   
 carry 1,000 tons each and average 75  
 mph, while the inter-city passenger   
 trains average 100 mph.
