		<title>17Leigh on Mendip description.</title>
		<content>   The village is a linear village set 
 in farmland on the Mendip Hills at a  
 height of about 180 metres. It has one
 main street running east to west along
 the north slope of a shallow valley.  
 There is a small council estate to the
 south of the street and similar       
 private housing to the north.         
   The older houses are built of local 
 limestone which, in many cases, has   
 been cement rendered. At the extreme  
 west end of the village is a          
 recreation ground. The main road is   
 about 1km to the south so there is    
 little through traffic and only an    
 occasional bus service. The only      
 important local employment is in      
 farming and the limestone quarrying   
 industries.
