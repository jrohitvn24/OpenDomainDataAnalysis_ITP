		<title>09THE VILLAGE OF BURITON</title>
		<content>{                                      
{Local History:}This village (pop.464) 
 is a typical spring-line settlement   
 situated at the base of the South     
 Downs.  The springs still feed the    
 Wooliff Pond and the Village Pond.    
 It is uncertain when the village was  
 founded but field systems, encampments
 burial mounds, Roman villa sites and  
 sunken lanes suggest a continuous     
 community since Neolithic times.  The 
 church was built in the 11th Century  
 but the 'burh' in Buriton suggests a  
 Saxon origin. {Population:}The        
 population varied through the         
 centuries, but once agriculture was   
 based on the yeoman farmers and       
 cottagers, new farmhouses were built  
 and the village expanded. After the   
 17th Century only existing buildings  
 were replaced or subdivided.{
