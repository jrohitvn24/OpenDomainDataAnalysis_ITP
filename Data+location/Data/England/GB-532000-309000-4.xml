		<content> At school we play many games such as  
 netball,football,bakers,bulldogs,spot 
 and chain-tiggy.In the evening some   
 children play on the adventure        
 playground at the side of the football
 pitch.At the church some of us go     
 bell-ringing.                         
     At home many people enjoy watching
 television and listening to the radio 
     Some prefer the pubs in Gedney    
 Hill like the Red Lion or the Duke's  
 Head or perhaps The Old Golden Ball.In
 the pubs some people like playing     
 pool,snooker,darts and dominoes.There 
 is also a bowling green in the village
 so a few people play bowls in their   
 spare time.                           
     Many people enjoy fishing in the  
 rivers and streams as well.There are  
 two adult football teams in the       
 Peteborough league.We have a school   
 football team and a netball team.     </content>
