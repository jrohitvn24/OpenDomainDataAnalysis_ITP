		<title>18GOVERNMENT IN NETHERBURY</title>
		<content> Local government is Netherbury Parish 
 Council, consisting of 11 members, 5  
 elected from Netherbury, 3 from       
 Melplash and 3 from Salway Ash.  They 
 are unpaid, but there is a clerk      
 appointed by this council who receives
 a salary amounting to 48% of a penny  
 rate.  This produces Â£750.  Council   
 must meet at least 4 times each year; 
 in March a special meeting must be    
 called, open to any member of the     
 Parish, to ask questions and speak on 
 local matters.  The powers of the     
 Council are very limited, but they are
 responsible for keeping foot and      
 bridle paths open.  All applications  
 for planning consent will be sent to  
 them for comment and this will be     
 taken into account by the Planning    
 Committee of the West Dorset District 
 Council.  At present the Electoral    
 Roll for Netherbury contains 310 names</content>
