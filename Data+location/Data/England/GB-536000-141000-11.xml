		<title>11LINGFIELD PARK RACE COURSE</title>
		<content> Lingfield Park Race Course is owned by
 a small group of people, one of whom  
 is himself an ex_jockey. Lingfield    
 Park itself covers 260 acres and gives
 fulltime employment to 35 people. The 
 jobs range from secretaries, catering 
 staff, gardeners and general odd job  
 and repair employment. The Park offers
 facilities other than racing in form  
 of a Conference and Training Centre,  
 and in the near future there will be a
 golf club and a large playground for  
 the children who come to the races    
 with their parents.                   
    The Park makes most of its money   
 through the entertainment facilities  
 it offers business people. There is a 
 choice of boxes and suites available  
 for lease or daily hire. The prices   
 range from Â£200 per day for a private 
 box to Â£600 per day for the Eclipse   
 Suite suitable for 100 guests.        </content>
