		<title>12 The Windsor Lodge Hotel</title>
		<content>   The Windsor Lodge Hotel was built at
 the turn of the century by Wrights of 
 Great Missenden. The present owner,   
 Mr.Riley,has been at the Hotel for    
 twenty four years. At first it was    
 used as a school for backward,        
 privileged children. The school had   
 seventy mixed children and the cellar 
 was used for the childrens bicycles,  
 while their playroom was the present  
 bar. It was a school until 1961 when  
 it was changed into a hotel by Mr.    
 Sherwood.                             
   The Hotel,which has a restaurant and
 is used as a conference centre,has    
 twenty six bedrooms,half of which are 
 single. Twenty years ago a single room
 cost Â£1.35 a night,it now costs       
 Â£27.50. Each room has a small colour  
 television and a radio. The hotels    
 customers are attracted to it by its  
 good reputation.                      </content>
