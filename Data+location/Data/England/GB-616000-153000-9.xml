		<content> I enjoy doing Break Dance very        
 much...                               
 but the problem is that some of the   
 moves are very difficult.Break Dance  
 is the newest craze.It requires lots  
 of skill and strength.Some moves are  
 quite easy such as 'Caterpillar'      
 (forwards and backwards).Some of the  
 hardest moves are the 'Windmill',     
 'Head-spin','Handglide','Backspin' and
 'Flapjack'.                           
 Bulldog is my favourite playground    
 game.I like it because there is a lot 
 of running to do and it gives me a bit
 of exercise.Somebody is 'it' and there
 is a semi-circle at the top of the    
 playground and one at the bottom.You  
 run from one semi-circle to the other 
 without getting caught. The first     
 person to get caught is 'it' in the   
 next game.
