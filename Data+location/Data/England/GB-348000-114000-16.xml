		<title>16All about me</title>
		<content> I am ten years old and go to Odcombe  
 V.A. Primary School. I live in a large
 modern house not far away. There are  
 four in my family - mum, dad, sister  
 and me. My dad makes soles for shoes  
 and my mum works on the local fruit   
 farm. We have a pet dog, three fish   
 and a guinea pig. My favourite meals  
 are sausage and chips, and egg and    
 bacon. My favourite puddings are rice 
 pudding and blancmange and custard.   
 I do quite a lot of activities: I     
 collect postcards, soldiers and play  
 mobile. After school on Monday I go to
 swimming club, I go to scouts on      
 Tuesday, cubs on Wednesday and tennis 
 on Friday. On Thursday evening I watch
 T.V. At the weekend I do judo on      
 Saturday and stay at home on Sunday.  
 In the summer holidays we usually go  
 to stay in a caravan on a farm in     
 Cornwall or Wales.                    </content>
