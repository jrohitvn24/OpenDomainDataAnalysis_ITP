		<title>11Our house in St.Helens</title>
		<content> Houses are our homes.There are        
 different kinds of house.There are    
 detached,semi-detached,terraced,      
 flats and bungalows.I live in a       
 terraced house.                       
    Terraced houses are joined in a big
 row.My house has had an extension put 
 on.The kitchen is now twenty-two feet 
 (7m) long.In it is a breakfast-bar and
 plenty of cupboards.Also downstairs is
 a porch,a huge hall,a living-room and 
 a front room.We live mainly in the    
 living-room near the kitchen.         
    Up eleven stairs and one at the top
 we have three bedrooms and a bathroom.
 We also have an attic and a sunroof.  
    A terraced house has no front      
 garden,only a small one at the back.  
 We mostly have a yard with a shed and 
 a long set of gates.
