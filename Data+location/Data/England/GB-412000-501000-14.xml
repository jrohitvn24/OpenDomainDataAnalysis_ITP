		<title>14Willance's Leap</title>
		<content>  Robert Willance was a successful lead
 miner who loved to explore the Dales  
 hills. He was once out with a hunting 
 party when they were caught in fog.   
  Robert and his horse fell over a 200 
 foot cliff. The horse was killed but  
 Robert lived and suffered a broken leg
  To keep his leg warm from the cruel  
 weather Robert slit the horse's       
 stomach open and stuck his broken leg 
 into it.                              
  Later on he was found and his leg had
 to be amputated. Tradition says that  
 the leg was buried in the churchyard  
 in Richmond and in 1615 when Robert   
 died he was buried with the leg.      
  Now there are two monuments where    
 Robert fell in 1606, they are just 2  
 miles outside Richmond. People often  
 walk there on a Sunday afternoon, the 
 views of the Swale and Richmond       
 breathtaking.                         </content>
