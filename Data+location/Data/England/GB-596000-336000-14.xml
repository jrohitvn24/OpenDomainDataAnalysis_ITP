		<content>  This is a problem in such a changing 
 community. Farming no longer needs the
 manpower which the village supplied.  
 With no daily transport to centres of 
 work, the young people tend to move   
 out of the village, their place often 
 taken by tourists and week end people.
 This means the shops are no longer    
 viable. There is now only the baker   
 who sells a small amount of grocery,  
 and the Post Office.Newcomers do not, 
 on the whole support the Post Office  
 but drive into Holt or Fakenham.      
 Eventually this will mean the loss of 
 its services and the older residents  
 without cars will have difficulty in  
 cashing pensions, or shopping within  
 the village. A small unit, making     
 collators in the former school,is the 
 only local industry.
