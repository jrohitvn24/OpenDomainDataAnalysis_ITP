		<title>15SCOUTS CAMP (1)</title>
		<content> Following a spell of fine weather in  
 February the Scout Leaders decided to 
 hold a weekend camp at Primrose Hill, 
 Scawby. The objective was for the     
 Scouts to practice their basic camping
 skills. Thirteen Scouts accompanied   
 two Leaders on a dry Saturday morning 
 and very soon after arrival tents were
 pitched and lunch was prepared.       
 After lunch the Scouts were instructed
 in certain basic survival skills and  
 little did we know of what was to     
 come! Some two hours later, as fires  
 were being prepared for the main      
 cooked meal of the day, it started    
 snowing, a flurry at first but soon a 
 blizzard.                             
 Meals were completed and much fun was 
 had in the deepening snow. However,   
 everybody became wet, cold and        
 following a vote, we went to bed.
