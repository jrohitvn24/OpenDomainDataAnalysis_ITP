		<title>18MY DAY, BY FIONA, AGED EIGHT</title>
		<content> I get up at 7.30 am. For breakfast I  
 have a drink of tea and some toast. I 
 get dressed into a dress or a jumper  
 and skirt. Then I get washed and clean
 my teeth.I walk up to school and talk 
 to my friends till the bell goes.     
 After the bell has gone we start our  
 lessons. We do English, Maths, News,  
 Handwriting &amp; Scripture. Sometimes we 
 watch TV. For school dinner we might  
 have meat, salad, potatoes. After play
 we do History or Geography. We go home
 at 3.15. I get changed into some      
 trousers and play till teatime. For   
 tea we might have stew and potatoes,  
 and then apple pie.  I play with my   
 friends in the village till 7 pm then 
 I might play on my bike till it is    
 supper time. I have some cornflakes   
 and a drink and watch a bit of TV.    
 Then I put my nightie on, wash myself,
 clean my teeth and get into bed.      </content>
