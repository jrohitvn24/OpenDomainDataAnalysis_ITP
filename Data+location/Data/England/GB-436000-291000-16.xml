		<content> Each year there is a theme and this   
 year it was 'make believe'.           
                                       
 There are a number of different       
 competitions - the best float,best    
 walker, best group of walkers...      
 Many organisations and individuals    
 took part.                            
 The overall winner was a float by     
 Bulkington Mothers dressed as         
 characters from Quality Street        
 chocolate.                            
 Lex Wilkinson won their class with a  
 giant mushroom,surrounded by gnomes   
 collecting money in their out-        
 streached fishing nets.               
 The Girl Guides showed what fun       
 camping was and the Boy Scouts        
 represented the Wizard of Oz.         
 George Eliot Hospital had good fairies
 at one end of the float and wicked    
 witches at the other.                 </content>
