 Tilsworth are two small villages with 
 a population of 827 and 358           
 respectively.To the south,beyond a    
 disused railway lie Totternhoe Knolls 
 with Maiden Bower and the hamlet of   
 Sewell to the east.                   
  The old inn,The Five Bells o'        
 Stanbridge,is situated beside an      
 ancient village green with the church 
 of St John the Baptist at the other   
 end.Further along this road is the    
 elementary school which serves        
 Stanbridge and Tilsworth.In Tilsworth 
 there is a moated manor house with    
 stone gatehouse built during the War  
 of the Roses.Opposite stands All      
 Saints church on the highest point of 
 the village.                          
  The Knolls at 160m above sea level   
 provides the focal point of the area.
