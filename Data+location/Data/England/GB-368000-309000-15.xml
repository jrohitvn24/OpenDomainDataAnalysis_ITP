		<title>15PRIORSLEE TRADING ESTATE</title>
		<content> We went from our School, Queenswood   
 Primary, to Snedshill where there are 
 two small trading estates. It belongs 
 to the Lilleshall Steel Company. It is
 part of an enterprise zone which is a 
 place where you can start your own    
 business.                             
                                       
 There is an ex-servicemen's club there
 along with a firm called              
 "Superburgers" which makes beefburger 
 vans. Behind a snooker club there is a
 place which makes ready-made concrete.
                                       
 Once there was a blast furnace here   
 which made steel. The rolling mill    
 rolled it out to make cars and        
 steel articles. Many  people          
 worked here until it closed down. They
 knocked down the building and created 
 various small firms.
