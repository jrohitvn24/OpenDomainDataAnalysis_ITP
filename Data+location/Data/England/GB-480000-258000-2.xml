		<title>02COGENHOE ... the past.</title>
		<content>   The geology of the area has been    
 particularly important in the         
 development of{Cogenhoe village.      
 Neolithic farmers found the light     
 soils ideal for their primitive       
 ploughs; valley gravels provided a    
 plentiful supply of flint too!        
 Settlement fluctuated during the      
 Bronze, Iron and Roman Ages.          
  {The Oxford Dictionary of Place Names
 argues that COGENHOE gets its name    
 from an Anglo-Saxon man named{CUCGA   
 who lived on a{HOE}or hill. Others    
 would argue that the first part is    
 derived from{GUCKEN}(to spy); "the    
 only place so named in England",      
 HARTSHORNE, 1903.                     
   As time went on the pattern of life 
 changed. A{cross}was erected in the   
 middle of the village and as the      
 village became more and more          
 prosperous{churches}were built.       </content>
