{Mrs.R.D.S.London}was born in Littleton
 and has lived the same house,         
 Broadview,for 65 years.We interviewed 
 her and found out about Littleton and 
 she told us that Flowerdown,the new   
 home of the Royal Green Jackets was   
 going to be an H.M.prison or a housing
 estate if it was not defence land.    
 The people of Littleton are very      
 friendly.She approves of the changes  
 such as electricity.Over the years it 
 has been enlarged so there are more   
 people and more houses.The only church
 is a Church of England church called {
{St.Catherine's.}There are two army    
 barracks,{Worthy Down Camp}and{       
{Flowerdown.                           
{ }
