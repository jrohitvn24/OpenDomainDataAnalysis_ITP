		<title>16Eversley Church, St. Mary's</title>
		<content>    The present church was designed and
 built by John James between 1724 and  
 1735. There is a large sarsen stone   
 under the floorboards near the font   
 which is thought to be connected with 
 a pre-Christian religious site. The   
 chancel screen is the only 18th       
 century one in Hampshire.             
    Eversley was the home of{Charles   
{Kingsley}when he was rector from 1844 
 until his death in 1875. There is a   
 plaque in the church to his memory. He
 wrote most of his books including{The 
{Water-Babies}while living in the large
 house, now known as The Old Rectory,  
 next to the church. One of the stained
 glass windows in the church shows two 
 water-babies. In the churchyard there 
 is a sequoia tree which was planted by
 his daughter Rose, just after his     
 death, from a seed collected on his   
 last American tour.                   </content>
