		<title>08  Wilnecote Fun Run</title>
		<content> The second annual Fun Run took place  
onSunday 19th May from Wilnecote High  
School. The 828 runners of all ages    
ran from Hedging Lane to Dosthill up to
Two Gates and back to Wilnecote. The   
winner was Steve Portman, a local      
runner who ran the 5 miles in 26       
minutes 2 seconds. There were runners  
from all over the country including    
London and Wales. The organiser of     
this, one of the biggest Fun Runs in   
the Midlands, Mr David Owen, said, "The
greatest thrill was seeing the runners 
lining up at the start and seeing local
Wilnecote Junior School pupil Russell  
Orchard, a spina bifida victim,        
crossing the line."    It is hoped to  
hold a similar event next year.
