		<title>15EMPLOYMENT AROUND CRICK</title>
		<content>  We sent out a questionnaire to find  
 out about employment in Crick.Of the  
 130 that came back we gathered the    
 following information. 63.35% of the  
 employed people were men,31.30% women 
 and only 5.35% were teenagers.        
  A lot of people had professions; we  
 were surprised at the number of men in
 this category. Services came very     
 close, then Manufacturing followed by 
 Technology,Storage, Land and our "Any 
 other Job" category which held        
 everything from Lorry driver and      
 builder to clerical secretary. 40     
 people worked in Crick and 90 worked  
 elsewhere.                            
 We have not been able to find out what
 % of people are unemployed but we     
 don't believe it to be very high in   
 this area.
