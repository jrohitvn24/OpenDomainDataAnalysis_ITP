		<title>15NEW YORK IN THE PAST</title>
		<content>On New York Road there is a public     
house(pub)named "Dun Cow Inn" built in 
1912.In 1847 there was a Dun Cow Pub   
standing on the same site as toay.     
There is a puzzle about New York Board 
School built 107 years ago,it was named
Murton School because Murton was the   
more important village but the only    
land available was in New York.There   
used to be another building where      
Wheels and Customs is and that was     
called County Store.This sold          
furniture.White Washed Cottages were   
where the newsagents shop now is.      
The Forge has been standing in its     
present location for over 150 years,   
and is still operating.You can still   
get horses shod there.The house next   
door was demolished a couple of years  
ago but in 1881 it was a pub called The
Travellers Rest,owned by Anthony Scott 
Robson.                                </content>
