		<title>07FUN RUN, NE Sutton Coldfield</title>
		<content>Many people went to watch and some even
took part in the Sutton Fun Run on 2nd 
June, an annual local event attracting 
3500 entrants open to all age groups.  
The course is 10 miles long through    
Sutton's streets and park. Starting    
from the Gracechurch Centre the runners
enter the park through Banners Gate,   
exit by Four Oaks Gate and finish back 
in Gracechurch. Finishers received     
medals.                                
The event was sponsored by local firms,
notably Ansells Brewery and Colliers   
Cars-the latter donated a car to be    
raffled. Many entrants had private     
sponsorship. The proceeds went to local
causes e.g. Good Hope Hospital. Some   
ran in teams. The "ACROSS" team from   
Holy Trinity RC parish used its        
proceeds to send handicapped people to 
the shrine at Lourdes in France.
