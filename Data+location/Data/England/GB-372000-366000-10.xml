		<content>       Our school is a Church Aided    
 school and is linked with St.Lukes in 
 Holmes Chapel.We have assembly each   
 morning with a hymn, a story and      
 prayers.On Fridays the vicar joins us 
 for prayers.Each term we go out on an 
 educational visit. At Christmas we do 
 a nativity play in the church, and    
 have a party at school.Near to Easter 
 we decorate eggs for a competition.The
 summer term sees us in the inter-     
 schools Swimmimg Gala and our own     
 sports afternoon. To end the year we  
 have a service in church when the 4th 
 years receive a Bible each.           
       The 4th years go on to the      
 Comprehensive which was opened six    
 years ago,they will stay there until  
 they are 16/18. The 4th years from    
 Middlewich Road school also go there. 
 Both schools are much bigger than ours
