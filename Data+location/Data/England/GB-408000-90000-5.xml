		<content> I like Bournemouth for the sea and the
 surrounding countryside. All my       
 friends are here. I have travelled to 
 many parts of the world but I would   
 not want to live anywhere else.       
 Bournemouth has a quality about it.   
                                       
 Yes, there have been changes some good
 and some bad. The BIC takes up too    
 much room, I think they should have   
 built a proper swimming pool, I have  
 only visited it once. There are good  
 shops here but most of all my friends 
 are here and I would not like to live 
 anywhere else.
