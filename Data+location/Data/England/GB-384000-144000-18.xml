		<title>18WARMINSTER'S STAR NEWSAGENT</title>
		<content> Housed in a 17th century building at  
 the centre of the Market Place is one 
 of the most successful newsagents in  
 the West of England - "Paynes", open  
 96 hours a week, employing dozens of  
 part-time staff and selling over 3000 
 newspapers a day. The owner, Mr Alan  
 Gallagher, is remarkable for the wide 
 variety of stock which he carries, so 
 much so that he now runs 4 seemingly  
 separate enterprises. For example,    
 toys were once sold in the basement of
 Paynes; demand for toys increased so  
 he opened a separate toy shop,        
 Pleasures, which has now moved to even
 larger premises. Above the main sales 
 floor of Paynes is his stylish and    
 profitable tea-shop, Pollys, and along
 the street is his ladies' wear shop,  
 Delights. Mr Gallagher believes that  
 newsagents will continue to prosper   
 because of the variety they offer.    </content>
