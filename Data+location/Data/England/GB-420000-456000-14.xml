		<title>14A Home in Kettlesing</title>
		<content>     The majority of houses are former 
 farmhouses or agricultural cottages,  
 now modernised to a very high stan-   
 dard and generally in keeping with    
 local tradition.  There is a          
 scattering of new housing - a string  
 of bungalows at Tang, and scattered   
 individual houses, mainly retirement  
 homes.                                
   The oldest house is probably West   
 Syke Green Farm in Felliscliffe, which
 is reputed to have timber joints      
 dating back to the fourteenth century.
 Tang Farm has remained largely        
 unaltered, being a fine example of a  
 Dales farmhouse, and still having a   
 thatched barn.                        
   Near the Anglican church lies a row 
 of very attractive Victorian          
 almshouses, built by local            
 benevolence.
