		<content> On Friday{Mr. War}came into school and
 we interviewed him about changes in   
 the area. Mr. War is over 60 years    
 old. We asked him if he likes the area
 as it is. He replied that he thought  
 it was improving year by year.        
 Children are better off than when he  
 was a lad. We asked him if Roach Vale 
 Primary School should have been built.
 Mr. War said "Yes" and that a lot more
 schools should have been built too.We 
 also asked him if he would like to    
 live in an old people's home. He said 
 "No".He told us that before the       
 Colchester by-pass was built all the  
 traffic going to Clacton and Walton   
 had to go through the town centre. Mr.
 War's father was often the policeman  
 on duty at Headgate. He had to direct 
 the traffic through the town because  
 there were no traffic lights or       
 pedestrian crossings.                 </content>
