		<content> The area can be divided into three    
 distinct sections.To the north there  
 is a mixture of council houses,private
 houses,shops and trading estates,in   
 general a working class community.The 
 middle of the block consists mainly of
 farming land with three large         
 buildings of note.The southern part of
 the block is predominantly middle     
 class where housing is entirely       
 private in a rural setting.           
  Another feature of the block is that 
 the river wear divides the area by    
 flowing from north to south.
