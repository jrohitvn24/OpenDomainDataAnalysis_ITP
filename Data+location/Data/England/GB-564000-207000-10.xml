		<content> The workers take them out for a 20    
 minute walk night and morning every   
 day for exercise. Some dogs are       
 entered for shows including Crufts at 
 Olympia in January. They were awarded 
 a 3rd prize one year and Mr. Dobson   
 has been invited to judge at Crufts.  
 They export about 100 every year      
 mainly to America and South Africa and
 the most common breed is the German   
 Shepherd.                             
     It is an excellent place to visit 
 even if you are just passing through  
 Roxwell. You could just pop in and    
 have a look around. The owners are    
 friendly and knowledgeable and the    
 place is kept neat and tidy. The dogs 
 are happy and noisy.
