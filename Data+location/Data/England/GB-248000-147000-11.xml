		<content> Ilfracombe has four banks, Lloyds,    
 Midland, Barclays and Natwest. Also   
 four Building Societies,these are the 
 Alliance, Anglia, Bristol and West and
 West of England. All are in the High  
 Street.The average number of staff for
 the banks in the summer is sixteen in 
 the winter is fourteen. The average   
 number of staff for a Building Society
 is about ten. In the summer the banks 
 hold more than five hundred thousand  
 pounds each week and about one hundred
 thousand pounds in the winter.The     
  busiest time of the year is the      
 summer because Ilfracombe is a holiday
 resort and the influx of tourists     
 brings more money to the area. The    
 busiest days are Mondays and Fridays. 
 Mondays, because businesses pay in    
 their weekend takings and Fridays     
 because people draw out money for the 
 weekend.                              </content>
