{ Maud Heath}was a widow who lived in  
 Langley Burrell in the Middle Ages.   
 She saved money and when she died the 
 money went to build a causeway, which 
 is a raised footpath, from{Chippenham 
{Clift to Wick Hill.}It was to help    
 people cross the flooded fields around
 the River Avon so they could get to   
 Chippenham Market and back again      
 without getting their feet wet.       
                                       
  Under a deed of gift of 1474, land   
 and houses which were then worth about
 eight pounds a year were given in     
 trust to build and maintain this      
 footpath. The whole footpath, which is
 four and a half miles long, is still  
 maintained by this five hundred year  
 old charity.
