		<title>05AMMERDOWN AND BABINGTON</title>
		<content> AMMERDOWN HOUSE designed by James     
 Wyatt an example of the fashionable   
 Palladian style. Standing in formal   
 gardens and a large walled park a mile
 East of Kilmersdon, it was built in   
 l789 by Thomas Samuel Jolliffe, an    
 ancestor of the present Lord Hylton.  
 The Column erected in l853 by Col.    
 John Jolliffe is a prominent landmark 
 on the skyline. BABINGTON HOUSE stands
 in parkland with a chain of lakes, a  
 mile S.W. of Kilmersdon.  Built in    
 l703 by Mompesson, and a perfect      
 example of Queen Anne architecture, it
 remained in possession of the         
 Knatchbull family for 200 years. The  
 present owners have restored the      
 house. A tiny Wren church stands      
 opposite the entrance. Although       
 officially Babington Parish Church,   
 the only community it now serves is   
 the nearby hamlet of Newbury.         </content>
