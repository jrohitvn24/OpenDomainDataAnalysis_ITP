		<title>19SUMMER AND WINTER LETTING</title>
		<content> Sometimes through the winter people   
 stay in the holiday cottages.   Some  
 of them come from London and they say 
 that they would like to live in       
 Kilmington.                           
 Some people do bed and breakfast      
 throughout the year, too.  In the     
 summer, most people stay for only one 
 night, so they are probably touring   
 the West Country.   They come from    
 miles away and sometimes they stay for
 longer.                               
 People who take in visitors for bed   
 and breakfast usually keep a book in  
 which the holidaymakers write where   
 they have come from and what it was   
 like staying here for their holiday.  
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
