		<content>    The area around{Belper Lane}and    
{Mount Pleasant Drive}has a great      
 variety of housing,from houses about  
 15 years old to cottages dated about  
 1860. Behind the houses on{Pinewood   
{Rd.}is a field where the Derbyshire   
 County Council was going to build a   
 primary school. Now they plan to build
 houses. The residents have formed a   
 protest group and have asked to rent  
 the field to extend their gardens.    
 There are two{General Stores}on Belper
 Lane and one is an Off-licence. There 
 is{Belper Riding Centre}at Hill Top   
 and a Scout Hut at the bottom.

 Mr.Hancock delivers milk. At{Dalley   
{Farm,}Mr.Fletcher has 60 cows milked  
 in a parlour, 4 cows on each side.    
 About 900 litres a day goes along     
 pipes to a refrigerated tank. A milk  
 tanker takes it to the dairy.         </content>
