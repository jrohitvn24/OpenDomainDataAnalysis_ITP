		<content>  My{house}is on an estate.It is a     
 quarter of the way around our{estate}.
 We live next to two houses. When you  
 are in the back we have three         
 neighbours.Our road is rough because  
 they have been laid with loose        
 chippings.We have a smooth drive and a
 big front garden and a small back     
 garden.We are going to make a double  
 garage on the side of our wall.Our    
 grage door is blue. There are two     
 hills on both sides of our estate.
