 characters representing the darkness  
 and terror of winter are defeated by  
 those personifying the light and life 
 of spring; the play ends with general 
 clowning and gaiety.                  
   The local version of the Pace Egg is
 always performed at Easter time.      
 Wardle Village (two miles from        
 Rochdale's town centre) currently     
 keeps this piece of local folklore    
 alive. The play is performed annually 
 in the village on Good Friday -       
 approx. 30 performances of the ten    
 minute play - acted against the       
 moorland background. In keeping with  
 tradition, eggs are collected, which  
 are divided amongst the elderly in the
 community. In recent years, money has 
 also been collected, which has been   
 used to help the elderly villagers.
