		<title>17EMPLOYMENT IN KELHAM</title>
		<content> The main area of employment in Kelham 
 is at Kelham Hall.Here Newark District
 Council officials have secretarial    
 staff,groundsmen and kitchen staff.   
 Farming is also important in Kelham   
 where tractor drivers and casual      
 workers work on the farms surrounding 
 the village.The public house employs  
 bar and kitchen staff.                
 The people of Kelham commute to Newark
 to secretarial jobs,shop assistants   
 and bank workers.Some people also     
 travel to Nottingham,Lincoln and Leeds
 in their capacity as executives.      
 Teachers travel to Newark and         
 Nottingham.There is little            
 unemployment in this area because     
 people are willing to travel to find  
 jobs.There is no industry except      
 farming and there is a need to        
 re-develop this area to prevent future
 unemployment.                         </content>
