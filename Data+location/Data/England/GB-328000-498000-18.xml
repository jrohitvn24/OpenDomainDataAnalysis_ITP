		<content>   {Traditional Lakeland architecture  
 forms the basis for the dwellings in  
 our block, with rendered slatestone,  
 slate roofs, massive chimney stacks,  
 small windows and sometimes slate slab
 porches. These are found in sheltered 
 situations, usually south-facing and  
 above flood level. The associated     
 agricultural buildings often contain  
 two storeys and occasionally a        
{"spinning gallery",}which is thought  
 to have been used as an open-sided    
 workspace in the days of the cottage  
 textile industry.{Yew Tree Farm       
 (319998) is a well known example.     
    The row of cottages at{Far End     
 (303982), in the same local materials,
 was originally built for miners and   
 quarrymen. Significantly, there are no
 modern-style buildings in the block,  
 showing the control exerted by the    
{Planning Board}and the{National Trust.</content>
