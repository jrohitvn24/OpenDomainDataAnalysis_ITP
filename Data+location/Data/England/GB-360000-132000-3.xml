		<content> Alhampton is a small village in       
 Somerset.There are 65 houses,there has
 been 3 houses,9 bungalows and 4       
 council houses built recently.There   
 used to  be a bakery,but it has been  
 converted into a house(Bakewell       
 House).There are more holiday homes   
 than residential houses,because house 
 prices are very high.The only milking 
 cows in Alhampton now are two Jerseys 
 at Langford Farm for personal         
 use.There is a small caravan site     
 behind the Inn,during the summer there
 are an average of 7 caravans on the   
 site.There is a little tin church,it  
 is quite small.There is a house called
 Saftey Light House , it was called    
 this because they say that it had     
 almost been burnt down but it wouldnt 
 burn.So it was re_built
