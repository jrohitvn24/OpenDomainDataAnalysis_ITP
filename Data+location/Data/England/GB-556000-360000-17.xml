		<title>17SKEGNESS POLICE FORCE</title>
		<content> Skegness has a small police station so
 in the summer when the population of  
 the town is doubled by the visitors we
 need more police  who are drafted     
 in from Lincoln and Boston.Skegness   
 is one of four divisons. Linclon,     
 Grantham and Sleaford are the other   
 three.We talked to our policeman who  
 is the "beat bobby" for our area.This 
 means he is the community policeman   
 resposible for our area.His job is to 
 get to know the people and the area so
 he can spot anything suspicious.This  
 is why he dosen't use a car,but       
 prefers to walk the beat.             
   In summer we suffer with the gangs  
 of scooter riders who come to make    
 trouble.The police sometimes have to  
 break up fights between rival         
 gangs.For this they can use the two   
 police  dogs we have in the town.We do
 not have any police horses.           </content>
