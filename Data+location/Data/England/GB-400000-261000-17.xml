		<content>  A lady came to visit us who had lived
 in the village for over 70 years.     
   She said  that she went to school at
 our school. There were four classes in
 the school then and children stayed   
 until they were 14 years old. The     
 school was heated with a big black    
 stove in the classrooms. We can still 
 see the chimney and the place where   
 the fire was in our classroom.        
 They used to sit on a long form and   
 the blackboard was moveable. There    
 were no school dinners, you had to go 
 home or take sandwiches. She said the 
 girls had knitting, sewing, darning,  
 and laundry lessons.They went to      
 Astwood Bank school for cooking       
 lessons. They had assemblies in the   
 morning. If they were naughty or late 
 they had a smack across the head or   
 they had the cane. There were no      
 pictures on the classroom walls. cont.</content>
