		<title>03Easington Colliery</title>
		<content> The colliery is the most important    
 place of work in Easington. The       
 sinking to the shaft was started in   
 1899. Coal was first brought to the   
 surface in 1910 and by 1929 output had
 reached one million tonnes per year.  
 Over the years the colliery has       
 produced coal for domestic use, gas,  
 coking, industrial use and power      
 stations. At present the coal is sold 
 mainly for domestic use and power     
 stations. All the coal produced comes 
 from undersea workings. The seams go  
 out for nearly six miles under the    
 North Sea and there are reserves of   
 about 36000000 tonnes. About 5500/6000
 tonnes of coal are produced each day  
 and in 1980/1 1407000 tonnes of coal  
 was produces in one year. About 2300  
 men are employed at the colliery. Many
 of them live with their families in   
 Easinton Colliery.                    </content>
