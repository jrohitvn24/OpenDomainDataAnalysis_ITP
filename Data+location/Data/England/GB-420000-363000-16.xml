 or trousers with zips down the sides  
 of their legs and baggy tee-shirts    
 with pop groups on them. The girls    
 wear ankle boots or jelly shoes and   
 the boys wear trainers. In school the 
 children wear uniform. Out of school  
 the clothes are made of bright colours
 like red, orange and yellow. The coats
 that children wear are donkey jackets,
 anoraks or parkas. Men wear jeans or  
 cords and when they go out they wear  
 cords and a jacket, with a white shirt
 and tie. The shoes that men wear are  
 like boots and when they are on a farm
 they wear wellies. Ladies and girls   
 wear jewellery like rings, ankle      
 chains, necklaces and bracelets.      
 Ladies wear trousers (but not jeans)  
 or a skirt with a blouse and a jumper.
