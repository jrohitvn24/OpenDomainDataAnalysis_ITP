		<title>14Interview Unemployed Youths</title>
		<content>  As unemployment seems to be the      
 'scurge'of the Eighties we interviewed
 some unemployed young people in their 
 teens and early twenties.Their        
 qualifications ranged from none to two
 O'Levels and seven C.S.E.'s.Only one  
 had had any 'job'training and that was
 a YTS course.Their period of          
 unemployment ranged from 3 months to 5
 years. The short term unemployed (up  
 to 6 months), all had specific job    
 requirements but the longer term      
 unemployed just wanted a job. The     
 youth with the highest qualifications 
 had the added handicap of being       
 registered blind. Surprisingly none   
 were bitter feeling that unemployment 
 is a Worldwide problem that only time 
 will solve.Some felt that the         
 Government should be creating new     
 jobs. All thought Benefits should be  
 at least Â£35 a week for 17 year olds. </content>
