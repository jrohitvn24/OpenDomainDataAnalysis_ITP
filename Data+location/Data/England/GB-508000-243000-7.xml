		<content> There had been a Post Office in the   
 High Street for 34 years.  When the   
 owners retired another couple in the  
 village had an extension built onto   
 their house and opened it as a post   
 office last January. By popular       
 request they also inherited the       
 village newspaper round and have      
 started stocking a small shop with    
 basic provisions.  They also operate a
 florist agency.
