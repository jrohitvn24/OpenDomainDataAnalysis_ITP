		<content> This block covers part of the East end
 of{Newcastle,part of Wallsend and     
{Hebburn,the}last being separated from 
 the rest by the R.Tyne.Nearly half the
 area is{residential}with mostly semi_ 
 detached and terraced houses with some
 high rise flats,of all ages from pre_ 
 war.There is still a considerable     
 amount of manufacturing industry,     
 mostly{light engineering}with a       
 reduced number of{shipyards.}Areas of 
 derelict land show in part the decline
 of heavy industry.Modernisation and   
 re_building is evident in houses,     
 shopping areas and the use of derelict
 or open space for recreational        
 facilities.{Communication}by road is  
 good and the recently introduced Metro
 system provides East_West passenger   
 access on both sides of the River.Land
{height}above sea(river)level does not 
 exceed about 45m.                     </content>
