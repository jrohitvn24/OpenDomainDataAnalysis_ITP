		<title>03 Cycling in Stevenage</title>
		<content>My B.M.X.is red and  yellow.It is      
called a Raleigh Burner.The tyres are  
thick and yellow.The bike also has     
pads on it so if you fall,you will not 
hurt  yourself.The pads are on the     
frame of the bike and between the      
handlebars.A B.M.X can do lots of      
tricks such as  bunny-hops when you    
jump over something and wheelies when  
you ride on one  wheel.At the          
Bowes-Lyon Centre there is a B.M.X.    
track to practice on.If you want to    
ride your bike in Stevenage, there are 
30 miles of cycle ways.Mr. Claxton     
introduced cycle ways to Stevenage     
He built the first cycle way           
in 1950 from Six Hills Way to Gunnels  
Wood Road.There are underpasses to keep
cyclists and cars apart at junctions   
and roundabouts.Mr.Claxton visited our 
school to tell us about his campaign to
establish cycle ways in Stevenage.     </content>
