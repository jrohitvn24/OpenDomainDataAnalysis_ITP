		<content> Although farming is the main feature  
 of this area, it only employs         
 comparatively few workers in the      
 community. Most of the farms are      
 worked by the owner or tenant, with   
 the help of a member of the family,   
 and at the most one other employee. At
 busy times like harvest or haytime    
 many of the local men are employed on 
 a casual basis after their normal     
 times of work. Garage, and post office
 do not employ any other than family;  
 the few workers at the small local bus
 garage all come into the area for     
 employment. Shropshire County Council 
 roads and bridges employ several men  
 in the village, and their are a number
 of lorry drivers and building site    
 workers. Inthe newer Brookside and    
 Millstream development many of the    
 people are professionals, architects, 
 teachers, small company directors,    </content>
