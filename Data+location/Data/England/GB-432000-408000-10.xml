		<title>10ATHERSLEY AREA SHOPPING.</title>
		<content> In our area we have two big           
 supermarkets they are the{COOP}and    
 the{ASDA}. Most of the other shops are
 small and tend to be expensive. The   
 ASDA is the largest supermarket in our
 area. It stands at the junction of    
 Laithes Lane and Laithes Crescent.    
   Every day about 2000 people come to 
 the ASDA.100 people are employed      
 there but only 10 live within our     
 survey area. (Some work in the morning
 and others in the afternoon.) The     
 store has 14 tills, 10 downstairs and 
 4 upstairs. It sells 12000 different  
 items. Here are just a few: sugar,    
 sweets, car seats,groceries and       
  covers. The most popular item on sale
 in all 101 ASDA stores is             
 sugar.(96,000,000)bags of sugar are   
 sold every year in all ASDA Stores.
