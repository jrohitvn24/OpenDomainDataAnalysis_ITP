		<content>   Mr.Bryan is an elderly Welford      
 resident who has lived in Welford     
 all his life. He is coming up to 80   
 years of age. He gave us the following
 information:                          
  The types of jobs people do have not 
 changed very much.There used to be    
 tennis and cricket clubs in Welford.  
 There weren't many houses built before
 the first World war,but there are alot
 now.Clothing has not changed very much
 since 1955. Most of the changes there 
 have been are good. Behaviour amongst 
 young people was very bad. Long hair  
 was not in fashion in 1955. Thirty    
 years ago you grew your own vegetables
 in the garden because you could'nt buy
 them in the shops.
