		<title>10Home Life : A Day at Home</title>
		<content> It is Saturday morning at about 10:45.
 I get up out of bed go down stairs and
 feed my Hamster. Then I switch on the 
 TV. About 10 minutes later mum and dad
 came down stairs. My mum makes me my  
 breakfast. I have Ricecrispies or     
 Weetabix. I eat it in the living room 
 while I watch TV, when I've finished I
 turn off the TV and go upstairs to get
 dressed. After that my sister's friend
 comes, my sister Caroline comes down  
 stairs and invites her friend Alison  
 in while she gets ready to go to      
 Bromley. After she has gone I knock   
 for my friend David and then he comes 
 back round to my house. We get my     
 hamster Cuddles out and let him run   
 around and then put him back in his   
 cage, I also have a cat called Sooty  
 and a rabbit called Flopsy. Then we   
 play wall ball. At 8pm David went home
 and my sister comes home from Allisons</content>
