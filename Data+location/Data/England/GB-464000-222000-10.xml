		<content>{Interview with school dinner lady,born
{and bred in Marsh Gibbon.             
 I have lived in the village for nearly
 all my life,there were just two years 
 when I lived in the next village but  
 even then I came back every day.      
  There have been a lot of changes,the 
 old villlage hall has gone and we have
 a new one,the chapel has gone and we  
 have a new one,the old school has been
 converted into houses and we have got 
 a new one. The old village hall was   
 just a tin hut but we had jolly good  
 fun in there.                         
  We didn't have any taps in our houses
 we had to use the taps beside the     
 road.                                 
  There used to be a diamond cutter in 
 the village,a blacksmith and three    
 cobblers and a man who was very good  
 at thatching ricks for all the farmers
 and I helped him sometimes.           </content>
