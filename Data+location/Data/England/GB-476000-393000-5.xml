		<content> This is Mistertons only{sheltered     
{accomodation}for the elderly.         
 When we went to {Swallow Court}.We    
 interviewed the manager, Mrs Bradley  
 and some of the old people. First of  
 all we asked Mrs Bradley what she     
 thought of the job.She said she       
 enjoyed her job but it was very busy. 
 The residents who can cook their own  
 meals do so,but those who cannot,order
{Meals on Wheels.}In every room there  
 are alarms incase of fires.Every      
 door although not actually fire proof,
 takes over an hour to burn through.The
 flats are for single people and the   
 bungalows are for married couples.We  
 then interviewed some of the          
 residents.They said they liked living 
 near the canal and liked to feed the  
 ducks.They all seemed to enjoy living 
 at Swallow Court but some did admit to
 missing their own homes.              </content>
