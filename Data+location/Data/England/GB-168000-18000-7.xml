		<content> In the past burning of the heath was  
 common practice to help the vegetation
 regenerate to aid summer grazing.     
 Little grazing is now permitted -     
 where it does take place fires still  
 occur and are usually started         
 accidentally by cigarette ends or     
 matches.                              
 Over the last two centuries many      
 hectares of Goonhilly have been       
 'reclaimed' for farming. This is a    
 long process taking several years     
 ploughing, manuring and harrowing.    
 Fortunately what remains has beem     
 claimed by the NCC and only grazing is
 allowed.There have been recent cases  
 of farmers on the fringe of the Downs 
 reclaiming a few hectares 'quietly' - 
 the problem is once the law has been  
 broken the natural environment is lost
 forever.                              
                                       </content>
