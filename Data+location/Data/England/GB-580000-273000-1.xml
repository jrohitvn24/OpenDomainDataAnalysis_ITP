 The whole area is owned by the        
 Forestry Commission and is managed    
 from the Santon Downham Centre as part
 of the Thetford Forest. Information   
 about the Centre,the landscape and    
 the ecology of the Forest can be found
 under 0580 0285. The area is bisected 
 by the only public road, the B1106.   
 There is a beautiful stretch where old
 beech trees line the road and here the
 F.C. have made a picnic site with a   
 map which indicates various walks     
 including the long-distance footpath. 
 Part of the Icknield Way passes       
 through the west side from the extreme
 S.W.corner in a N.N.E. direction.The  
 King's Forest is so named because it  
 was planted in 1935 for King George   
 V's Silver Jubilee.
