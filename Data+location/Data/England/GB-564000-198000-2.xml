		<content> The rather unusual place-name is      
 probably derived from{'ing at the     
{stone'}. Ing means homestead or       
 settlement and the 'stone' refers to  
 the glacial erratic, remains of which 
 can be seen to the south of the parish
 church and in the High Street.        
                                       
 A settlement existed in Saxon times   
 and the name{'Inga'}appears in the    
 Domesday book of 1086.                
                                       
 Much growth of the village was due to 
 its position on the main (originally  
 Roman) road from London to Ipswich and
 Norwich. Expansion in the last one    
 hundred years or so has been helped by
 Ingatestone's position on the main    
 railway line between London and East  
 Anglia. Population growth has been    
 particularly rapid since 1951.
