		<title>11Beverley Boys Brigade</title>
		<content> The Boys Brigade was founded in 1883  
 by Sir William Smith in Glasgow. Boys 
 of 6-7 years can join the Anchor Boys 
 Section, 8-11 year old boys join the  
 Junion Section, while 16-17 year old  
 youths can enter the Company Section. 
 Anchor Boys do art and craft. In the  
 junior section the activities include 
 badge-work, games, art and craft and  
 there is the opportunity to go to     
 camp. Company section members camp in 
 the Isle of Man, where they learn to  
 canoe and rock-climb amongst other    
 outdoor activities.                   
      It is good fun and character     
 building for boys.  Most Boys Brigades
 have bands.  Indoor activites include 
 tying knots and learning to identify  
 road signs.
