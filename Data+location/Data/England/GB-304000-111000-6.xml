		<title>06SQUARE CORNER, UFFCULME</title>
		<content>    The{Square Corner}was built        
 around{1785}and was purchased by the  
{Parish Church in 1971.                
    It is used for a general meeting   
 place for several{village activities  
 and{social gatherings}(e.g. Bible     
 Club, Day Centre for elderly, W.I. and
 British Legion). With its central     
 location it is often hired for{Coffee 
{Mornings}for fund raising by many     
{local organisations.}The{Vicar        
 and the{Uffculme Housing Trust}both   
 have offices upstairs.                
    It does not make a profit or a loss
 but aims to cover day to day running  
 costs from hire fees. Major repairs   
 are paid for by the Church.           
   In the past it has been a cottage,  
 a tailors shop and a Co-op which sold 
 odds and ends.
