		<title>19LIFE IN BINGHAM (4)</title>
		<content>    "What I do not like about Bingham  
 is the bottle bank - people climb on  
 top of the containers and take the    
 bottles and smash them."              
    "There are lots of pubs but why    
 can't they have children's rooms?"    
    "I don't like the rubbish that is  
 littered about Bingham. It spoils     
 Bingham."                             
    "Sometimes Bingham can be boring   
 when you naven't got any money to go  
 swimming or to go the Leisure Centre. 
 Apart from that Bingham is okay."     
    "I don't like the main roads."     
   {                                   
{   It seems that pollution of any sort
{really upsets and worries the children
{of Bingham, whether it be noise, fumes
{or litter.
