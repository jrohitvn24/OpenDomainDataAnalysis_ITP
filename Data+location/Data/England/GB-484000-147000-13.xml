		<title>13Sponsored Events.</title>
		<content> A sponsored event is where someone    
 promises to give you a certain amount 
 of money for every part of the event  
 you complete. For example in a        
 sponsored walk a person could promise 
 to pay 10p for every mile completed.  
    In our school during the last year 
 many boys have participated in        
 sponsored events. Here are some       
 examples of the events and their      
 purpose.
