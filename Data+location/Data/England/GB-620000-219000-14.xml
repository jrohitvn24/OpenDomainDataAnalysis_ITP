		<content> I LIVE WITH MY AUNTIE IN A SMALL      
 TERRACED HOUSE IN KIRBY CROSS. I HAVE 
 ONE SISTER, DONNA. I AM 12 YEARS OLD. 
 EVERY WEEKDAY MORNING I GET UP AT

 GOLD SCHOOL UNIFORM. I GO DOWNSTAIRS  
 AND HAVE MY BREAKFAST. I USUALLY EAT  
 CORNFLAKES AND DRINK ORANGE JUICE. I  
 WATCH BREAKFAST T.V. I GO BACK        
 UPSTAIRS, WASH AND BRUSH MY TEETH. I  
 GET MY BOOKS READY FOR SCHOOL. I      
 COLLECT MY 0.50P DINNER MONEY AND GO  
 TO GET THE COACH AT 08.45.            
 I ARRIVE IN SCHOOL AT 09.00. I WANDER 
 ROUND UNTIL THE BELL GOES AT 9.20.ONE 
 DAY'S LESSONS AFTER REGISTRATION, ARE 
 MATHS,PASTORAL AND SOCIAL,DRAMA,
