 This organisation was formed in 1981  
 under the name of Bosbury School      
 Parent/Teacher Association by a group 
 of Parents of children attending      
 Bosbury School and the then staff. The
 name was later changed.               
 Membership was automatic to all       
 parents of children attending the     
 school. The principle aim was to raise
 funds to buy additional educational   
 material, equipment and facilities for
 the benefit of pupils.                
 Funds were raised by means of Jumble  
 Sales, Bingo,Raffles, Dances etc.
