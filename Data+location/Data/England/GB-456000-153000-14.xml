		<title>14PEOPLE IN THE VILLAGE</title>
		<content> The interviewee lives in a bungalow.  
 She has only got one neighbour.She    
 moved into the village in 1969.Since  
 she moved to the village,the only     
 thing that has really changed is the  
 drainage system.At first it drained   
 into the village pond,then part of it 
 got filled in,and every time it rained
 the whole place flooded.The drainage  
 system was rearranged and now it's    
 alright.Her hobby/job is horse riding,
 eventing and MAINLY teaching people to
 compete.Her bungalow is surrounded by 
 lots of bridleways and countryside.The
 village is always very peaceful.She   
 uses the village church,but she thinks
 the congregation is too small.On      
 Christmas Eve people sing carols on a 
 farmer's tractor and trailer.The      
 oldest house is the cottage,built in  
 the 1400's,on the road to Newfound.Her
 house was built in the 1940's.        </content>
