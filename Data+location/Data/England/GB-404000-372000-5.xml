		<content>{Buxton's Commercial Centre.}          
 The survey area included the          
 commercial centre of Buxton which is  
 the area around Spring Gardens and the
 area around the Market Place. It was  
 generally agreed that Buxton had a    
 large number of amenities for a town  
 of its size. This reflects two facts. 
 Firstly, Buxton is an important       
 regional centre. Surveys of where     
 shoppers came from showed that many   
 came from surrounding smaller         
 settlements. Secondly, Buxton is an   
 important tourist centre for the Peak 
 District.                             
{Shopping.}The most important shops are
 to be found along Spring Gardens. This
 was proved by a pedestrian count. The 
 count also showed that a greater      
 proportion of the shoppers on Spring  
 Gardens had travelled further than    
 those shopping on the Market Place.   </content>
