		<content> Havenfield is an Old People's Home.   
 It has 43 old persons and the oldest  
 is a lady of 102 years old.           
    The conditions there are good,     
 there are bedrooms where the residents
 sleep. They have beds,drawers to keep 
 their clothes in and some have their  
 own televisions. There are rest rooms 
 where they can sit and talk to each   
 other and visitors. Havenfield is kept
 clean and tidy. There is a garden and 
 some of the residents like to work in 
 it. The staff are very friendly and   
 care for the residents well. I think  
 Havenfield is a very important place  
 because it cares for Darfield's old   
 people. If Havenfield was not there   
 the old people would not get the care 
 and attention they really need.
