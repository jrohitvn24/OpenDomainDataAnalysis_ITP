		<title>14Vandalism</title>
		<content>{Vandalism}is on the increase.Phone    
 boxes,bus shelters and walls of any   
 kind are defaced.{Vandalism}takes the 
 form of graffiti,smash glass and      
 destruction of public property.The age
 group of the {vandals}would seem to be
 between 10 and 18.Policing is scarce  
 in {Normanby}and{Eston}area and we    
 feel there should be more policing,at 
{Normanby}there is a bus stop covered  
 in white paint,black felt tip pen and 
 most of the glass is smashed.Nothing  
 has been done about it.               
                                       
        Although we think there is a   
 problem in our area,bigger towns have 
 bigger problems.
