		<title>14Social Concerns</title>
		<content> There is concern that Hungerford will 
 be enlarged with more houses.  It is  
 generally felt the town is large      
 enough and more housing development   
 should be kept to a minimum.          
 It is felt that light industry should 
 be attracted to the town thus         
 providing jobs for local people and   
 helping to negate the concern that    
 Hungerford may become a "dormitory"   
 town.To encourage industry to the     
 area, the Trade,Industry and Employ-  
 ment committee was formed, a prom-    
 otional brochure printed and a video  
 film made by 8 children from the local
 school.                               
 Lack of employment is a great concern,
 since 1984 the closure of 4 main firms
 Little car parking is available in    
 town.Parking is in  7O space car park 
 with some street parking.It is agreed 
 that more provision should be made.   </content>
