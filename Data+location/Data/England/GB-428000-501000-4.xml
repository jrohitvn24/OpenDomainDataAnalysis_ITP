		<title>04Employment in the Cowtons</title>
		<content> There is little local employment in   
 the Cowtons. The two garages offer    
 some, as do the 12 farms. Part time   
 employment, especially for women, is  
 found in the 3 public houses and 2    
 schools in the area. Most others have 
 to commute to Darlington, Teesside or 
 Northallerton to find work. In North  
 Cowton from 132 adults living in the  
 area covered, there were 65 commuters,
 2 men working away from home and 4    
 unemployed. In a similar survey in    
 East Cowton, from 176 adults there    
 were 96 commuters, 6 working away and 
 13 unemployed. 21 had village         
 employment although these were mostly 
 part time. 33% of wives work in North 
 Cowton but only 89 are full time. In  
 East Cowton over 50% work and 39% are 
 full time, often in a proffesional    
 capacity.                             
                                       </content>
