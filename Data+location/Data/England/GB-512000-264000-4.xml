		<content>    Mothers of pre-school children are 
 generally at home and find a rich     
 social life with other mums through   
 the 'Play &amp; Chat' Club and Playgroup. 
 Once children are at school there     
 is a tendency towards mothers finding 
 full or part-time employment. A       
 baby-sitting circle enables parents to
 participate in various activities     
 outside the home.                     
    We were interested to discover -   
 after so many warnings on our school  
 health programmes - that 42% of the   
 households surveyed still have at     
 least one smoker !                    
    In general, people care a lot about
 their home, how it looks and how it   
 feels.                                
    Approximately one-third of them get
 away for at least two annual holidays,
 and nearly two-thirds for one break in
 the year.                             </content>
