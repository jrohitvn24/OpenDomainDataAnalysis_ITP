		<title>14CARLTON INDUSTRIAL ESTATE</title>
		<content> From the window of our classroom we   
 can see the whole of the{Carlton      
{Industrial Estate;}we pass through it 
 on our weekly journeys to the swimming
 baths. There are many different types 
 of{factories;}these range from such   
 varying things as manufacturing       
 industries to warehouses used by local
 firms.                                
 Companies such as{Marks &amp; Spencer, SR 
{Gent, Goodyear Tyres}and even{a       
{pickling factory}which can make your  
 eyes water have units on the estate   
 which is right in the middle of a     
 number of villages and provides  a    
 good deal of{employment}for local     
 people.                               
 Work at the estate goes on 24 hours a 
 day and deliveries of food and        
 non-food products are carried by road 
 to all parts of the country.
