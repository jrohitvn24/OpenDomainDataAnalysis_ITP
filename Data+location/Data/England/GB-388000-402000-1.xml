		<content>   Our area in Oldham isn't really the 
 sort of place you'd go for a holiday. 
 There are many people living here.    
 Most of them aren't very rich or very 
 poor, just average. Looking over our  
 area there are many cotton mills with 
 chimneys, rows of terraced houses, and
 a few green spaces in between. About  
 half of the houses are council houses,
 and the other half are private houses.
 In this area there are plenty of      
 shops, but they are mostly small      
 shops. There are a few supermarkets   
 though. There are lots of places for  
 sports and parks for playing in. There
 are lots of different places of       
 worship for mainly Christian and      
 Muslim religions. At the edge of the  
 block there are 'A' roads that lead   
 straight to the M62 motorway which    
 means that we are able to get to other
 places much quicker and easier.       </content>
