 Maghull was first mentioned in the    
 Domesday Book as Magele.It was two    
 leagues long and was one of 6 manors  
 held by a Saxon, Uhtred. In medieval  
 times it was probably a group of      
 scattered farms with only the church  
 as a nucleus.                         
 Today Maghull still has agricultural  
 activity but much of the area is      
 covered by housing estates and their  
 amenities. It must be pointed out     
 though that Maghull is not just a new 
 town absorbing an overflow of people  
 from Liverpool but also a rapidly     
 growing village with roots far back in
 history. In the last 20 years the     
 population has doubled to around      
 40,000.
