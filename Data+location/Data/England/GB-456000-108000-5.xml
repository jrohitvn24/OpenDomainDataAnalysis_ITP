		<title>05TRANSPORT IN NORTH FAREHAM.</title>
		<content> The N.Fareham area is dissected by 2  
 main roads,the A32 and the A333.The   
 A32 is one of the major routes linking
 Fareham and London and the north      
 Hampshire towns,consequently it is a  
 very busy road.Large trucks carry     
 imports and exports from the docks at 
 Portsmouth and Southampton and it is  
 used by tourists heading for the      
 continental ferries.Daily,tankers     
 collect the milk from local farms and 
 carry it to Portsmouth.The A333       
 carries traffic from the Portsmouth   
 area to and from Winchester.It carries
 mostly commuter traffic and being     
 narrow this road can be dangerous at  
 rush hour.Both routes have an hourly  
 bus service linking Fareham,Portsmouth
 and Winchester.There are no other     
 major road routes and no rail routes  
 at all in this area.
