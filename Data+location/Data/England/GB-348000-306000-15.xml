		<title>15Bayston Hill Police Station.</title>
		<content>    In the police station there are two
 offices,an interview room,a toilet,but
 no cells.This office covers an area   
 larger than Manchester,stretching from
 Cound to Chirbury.To do this there are
 four officers in Bayston Hill with    
 five more based at Atcham,Cressage,   
 Chirbury,Pontesbury and Ford.         
  Every morning they have to drive into
 Bayston Hill to look at the notices.  
 They patrol in cars linked by radio to
 the computer at Worcester.This tracks 
 them each time they call in so that it
 can work out which car is nearest to  
 the scene of emergencies.             
    Things like stray dogs and lost    
 property are passed on to headquarters
 in Shrewsbury.In Bayston Hill they    
 deal with complaints like noise and   
 vandalism.In the countryside they have
 calls to stray animals,accidents on   
 farm machinery,and fires.             </content>
