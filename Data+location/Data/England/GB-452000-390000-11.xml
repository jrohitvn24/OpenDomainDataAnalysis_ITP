		<title>11Maltby Market</title>
		<content> Maltby market is situated just south  
 of the shops on the High Street.It is 
 held on three days a week,Tuesday,    
 Friday and Saturday.There are 72      
 stalls on the open market and a small 
 indoor market hall.The traders come   
 from South Yorkshire and Notts,moving 
 their stands from town to town on the 
 different market days.The stalls are  
 mainly for food and clothing.On Friday
 the market is very busy with people   
 buying in food for the weekend.When we
 visitied the market it was colourful  
 and bright.It was busy with a bustle  
 of old people and mothers with young  
 children or babies.The narrow aisles  
 were crowded and as I went past the   
 stalls I could smell fish,flowers and 
 hot dogs and hear the buzz of the ice 
 cream freezer.
