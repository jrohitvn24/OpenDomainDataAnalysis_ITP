		<content> The milkman delivers at 5.30am, then  
 peace, before farming activity begins.
 At 8.20am Smith's coach collects      
 secondary-school children; from then  
 on a continuous stream of vehicles and
 cyclists goes along to school.  Later 
 the post van and newspaper lady's car 
 can be seen.  The milk lorry calls at 
 the farm and at 11.30am playschool    
 closes and the library van makes its  
 fortnightly call.  On Thursdays people
 visit the Post Office for pensions and
 later cars return to collect school   
 children.  The fish van makes its     
 weekly visit and at 4.15pm the coach  
 returns with the Thirsk school        
 children.  The twice-weekly grocery   
 and butcher's vans can be seen around 
 teatime and early evening sees people 
 and cars going to the village hall for
 meetings and sporting activities.
