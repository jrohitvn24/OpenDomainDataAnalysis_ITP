		<title>15A DAY IN THE LIFE - GIRL</title>
		<content>   I woke at seven, got up, dressed and
 went downstairs.  I warmed the lamb's 
 milk and went to feed him.Afterwards I
 went to the milking parlour to collect
 some milk from the tank.  Back at the 
 house I made my lunch and breakfast.  
   At eight I left for the bus,        
 travelling ten miles to school.  I    
 went through the usual routine of     
 eight lessons and two breaks.  At four
 I returned by bus, then walked two    
 miles home.                           
   Arriving, I dressed appropriately   
 and fetched the cows.  Later after    
 having tea and doing my homework I    
 played football with my younger       
 brother then put him to bed.  After   
 raking the cut lawn, I fed and shut up
 the chickens, and also the cats and   
 kitten, dog and hamster, then got into
 bed and read for an hour until ten    
 o'clock.                              </content>
