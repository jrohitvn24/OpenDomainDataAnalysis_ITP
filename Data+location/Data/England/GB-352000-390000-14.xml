		<content>     Kerrie has written about her      
 favourite school production.          
 "We take part in many school          
 assemblies and Christmas plays during 
 the year.  The teacher choses a theme 
 and then we make up a play, sing songs
 and play instruments. We also wear    
 costumes.  We usually do the play for 
 the rest of the school and for our    
 parents. My favourite production was a
 play that we did in the Drama Club.   
 This club takes place after school is 
 over and we stay to practise our play.
 The play was called 'Micro-Quest'.    
 All the characters in the play had the
 names of Computer words, e.g., Qwerty 
 and Brothers Dim.                     
     We sang many songs in the play. We
 showed the play to the rest of the    
 school and then we performed the play 
 at a nearby club.
