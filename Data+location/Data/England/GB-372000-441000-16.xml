		<title>16ANOTHER CLITHEROE GAME</title>
		<content>    Another of our favourite playground
 games is P for Poison.                
                                       
    P FOR POISON                       
    For this game you first choose one 
 person to be on. The people who are   
 not on hold onto that persons fingers.
 The person who is on says things like 
 P for Potato or P for Pea. When the   
 person who is on says P for Poison the
 other people run off. When they are   
 'tug' they have to go and lean against
 the wall. To free them someone has to 
 run under their arms. If you get 'tug'
 three times you are on.               
    It sounds hard but really it is    
 easy.                                 
                                       
                                       
 N.B. 'tug' = to be touched.
