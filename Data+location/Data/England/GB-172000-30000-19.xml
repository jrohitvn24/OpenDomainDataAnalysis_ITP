		<title>19A TYPICAL DAY OF THE PRIEST</title>
		<content> There is no such thing as a typical   
 working day in the life of a Parish   
 Priest.If such a thing did exist it   
 could begin perhaps at 8.30am.with    
 saying the Office of Matins.At 9.00am.
 a visit to the village school for     
 assembly followed by a Religious      
 Education lesson.At 10.30am.back to   
 the Vicarage to deal with             
 correspondence,prepare sermons,pick   
 hymns for Sunday services,write       
 material for the Parish magazine and, 
 if time permits,try to catch up on    
 some reading.The afternoon would be   
 spent mainly in visiting houses or    
 people in hospital.In the evening     
 there maybe wedding or other          
 interviews plus meetings of village   
 organisations to attend.Above all the 
 Parish Priest has to be available to  
 all his parishoners whenever they need
 him.                                  </content>
