		<content>    The extensive bridleway network on 
 Blackdown and Marley Common provides  
 a valuable facility for horse riders. 
 There is a jumping area and           
 opportunity for long gallops. They are
 very open and there are very many     
 picnic areas so you can sit down and  
 eat while holding your pony. Riders   
 must keep to the public Bridleways,   
 They must not leave litter. They must 
 not ride fast along Bridleways if     
 visibility is restricted. They must   
 ride slowly past walkers.             
    There are many fine views and a    
 maze of footpaths which attract       
 weeekend ramblers who come by rail    
 from London. The topography offers a  
 good test for orienteers and runners. 
    Mesolithic man left traces of their
 way of living by flints which they    
 used for fighting and for working and 
 by burial mounds.                     </content>
