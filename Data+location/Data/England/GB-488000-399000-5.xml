		<title>05Scotter's New Village Hall</title>
		<content> The hall was officially opened by the{
{Duchess of Gloucester}on 12.7.85.This 
 was the first royal visit since{King  
{John}visited the village in 1216.     
   The decision to build a new hall was
 taken at a public meeting in Jan.1977.
 The existing facilities were thought  
 to be inadequate due to population    
 growth.A site on the playing field was
 chosen as this could be leased for{Â£1}
 per annum.The hall was financed partly
 by grant aid and partly by money      
 raised in various ways by the{village 
{hall committee}.The most unusual of   
 these was to entertain a party of{    
{American tourists}in the village in   
 the summer of '85.Building was begun  
 in March 1982 by the{Manpower Services
{Commission}.Local volunteers have     
 helped with the interior decoration.  
 The hall,an imposing brick building,is
 the result of many years fund raising.</content>
