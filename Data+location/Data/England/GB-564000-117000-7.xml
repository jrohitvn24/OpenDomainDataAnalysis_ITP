		<title>07JACK FULLER</title>
		<content> Jack Fuller was an M.P he had been    
 left the Brightling Park mansion by MR
 Thomas Fuller who had rebuilt in about
 1697 when he first purchased the      
 mansion.                              
 Jack Fuller had a party in Londen     
 while serving paliament he had a bet  
 that he could see Dallington Church   
 spire from his bedroom window but     
 infact when he arrived home all he    
 could see was Brightling Church so to 
 save his money he had made the Suger  
 Loaf which is approximately 35 foot   
 high.So later when his friend came to 
 secure the bet he thought that Jack   
 Fuller had proved his point but really
 he had been deceived by Jacks forgery 
 church spire .At one time a farmer    
 nealy distroyed the Suger Loaf when he
 wanted to use the land for farming but
 the planning commissioner would not   
 allow it.                             </content>
