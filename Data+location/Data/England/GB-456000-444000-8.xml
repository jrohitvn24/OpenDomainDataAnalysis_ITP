		<title>08 LANDSCAPE NABURN LOCKS</title>
		<content> Naburn locks are on the River Ouse.The
 busiest time for boats going through  
 the locks is at the weekends mostly   
 Saturdays.The locks are open 7 days a 
 week.It costs Â£7.50 to go through the 
 locks.The locks flood regularly in    
 winter.Boats sometimes get stuck,once 
 a boat got stuck,it took 5 hours to   
 get it out.There are lots of people   
 who have fallen in.The lockeepers     
 houses are opposite the locks.It takes
 15 minutes to go through the locks.The
 locks have to be cleaned out to get   
 all the mud out,this is done by a     
 dredger.Most of the boats that go     
 through are barges,but also large and 
 small cruisers and canoes go through.
