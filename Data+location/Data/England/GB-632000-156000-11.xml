factories manufacturing a wide variety 
of things from medicine to hot water   
bottles and diesel compressors.Retail  
traders and labour intensive farms     
producing market garden crops also help
to provide a wide variety of           
employment.While these activities      
provide many opportunities some of the 
population,particularly young people   
are finding it difficult to obtain     
permanent positions.

weekend cottages and the population    
that used to live in the old town has  
moved to new houses outside the wall.  </content>
