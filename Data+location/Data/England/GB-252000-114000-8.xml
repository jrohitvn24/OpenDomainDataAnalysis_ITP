		<content>     My favourite hobby is stamp       
 collecting. I have three albums. At   
 the moment I am looking for Heraldry  
 stamps. There is a stamp club at      
 school, with a competition.           
   Another two hobbies of mine are     
 reading and drawing. I like to read   
 Enid Blyton and Laura Ingalls Wilder's
 books best. There is also a horse     
 series by Walter Farley - "The Black  
 Stallion". It is about a huge black   
 horse, and his friend, a boy called   
 Alec Ramsay. In every book they have a
 long, complicated and exciting        
 adventure. I draw horses a lot, and   
 get the Horse and Pony magazine       
 every fortnight.                      
   Every Thursday from 6.30 to 8 p.m. I
 go riding.  There are 10 horses at the
 riding stables. I also enjoy swimming 
 and go every fortnight with the school
 to the pool in Torrington.            </content>
