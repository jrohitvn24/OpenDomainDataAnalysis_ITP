		<title>13Education in the Butley Area</title>
		<content>The average family in the Butley area  
with two or three children of school   
age may find that they attend three    
different schools. Under the age of    
nine children are transported to Eyke  
school by bus. The child aged 9 to 13  
walks or cycles to Butley Middle School
and those over 13 are taken by bus to  
Farlingaye High School in Woodbridge,  
a journey of about eight miles. Eyke   
School has a play school for under     
fives attended by some infants from    
Butley. Some children over 16 go to    
the Suffolk College in Ipswich for     
Further Education or vocational        
training. Farlingaye H.S. has a        
sixth form for students over 16. A few 
children got to private schools in     
Woodbridge or Ipswich. Transport to    
Ipswich and Woodbridge for these       
children is a problem, the service bus 
goes at 7.50am. They return at 6.15pm. </content>
