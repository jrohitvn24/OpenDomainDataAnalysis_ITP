		<title>13TRAFFIC IN OUR AREA</title>
		<content> We made a{census}of all the traffic   
 which came into the{Horrabridge area  
 from Tavistock,Plymouth,Whitchurch,and
 Yelverton on a{Thursday}morning       
 between 08.00 and 09.00, which is the 
 rush hour when most people travel.We  
 found out some interesting trends.    
 Most people come to the village from  
 the main Tavistock road using         
 cars.Lorries rarely travel during the 
 early morning and local buisnesses are
 suppiled by van.Few people use        
 motorbike or bicycle and there was    
 only one public service bus.It was    
 noticed that far more cars leave      
{Horrabridge}at this time than enter   
 it,we think this is because many      
 people travel to Plymouth to work. We 
 expect that in the evening  more cars 
 would be found returning to the       
 village area.                         
                                       </content>
