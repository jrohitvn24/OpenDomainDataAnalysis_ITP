		<content>    The{Ham and Petersham}area lies to 
 the south of Richmond upon Thames,    
 Surrey. Most of the area is open space
 with discrete areas of residential    
 development located away from the long
 sweep of the River Thames. The main   
 north-south road from Richmond to     
 Kingston runs through the eastern half
 of the area, linking the old village  
 centres of Petersham and Ham. These   
 old villages and the area of riverside
 around Ham House are conservation     
 areas. Some residential development   
 has taken place between the Wars and  
 post War and there are a number of    
 council and private estates.          
  {Twickenham}is a long established    
 settlement with a tradition of        
 riverside uses and is an important    
 commercial centre in the London       
 Borough of Richmond upon Thames.
