		<title>07LIVING IN GROBY.</title>
		<content>    Groby is a nice ,peaceful place.It 
 is not the largest village around,but 
 it has its own industrial estate and  
 enough shops,pubs and houses to make  
 it quit a big village.Groby isn't a   
 pretty village but there are some     
 picturesque houses in the older part. 
 There are masses of houses on the new 
 estates with many more to be built.   
 There are 15 terraced houses on the   
 Ratby Road and these should not be    
 knocked down because they are part of 
 Groby's history.The part around the   
 chapel is pretty and peaceful but the 
 road is very narrow and it difficult  
 to pass parked cars.Over all Groby is 
 a nice place to live and is very      
 convenient for Leicester qnd the      
 motorway,however there is always room 
 for improvement though.
