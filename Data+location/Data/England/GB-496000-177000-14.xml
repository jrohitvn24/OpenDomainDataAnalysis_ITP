		<title>14THE THAMES</title>
		<content>  The Thames,once an important trade   
 route,is now a source of pleasure to  
 many.Holiday -makers hire a boat for a
 week's travel up-stream towards Oxford
 Pleasure-boats leave regularily for an
 hour's cruise.Boat-crews practise     
 their rowing eights and tens.Motor    
 boats speed forward leaving turbulent 
 water behind them.                    
  By the river on both banks there is  
 parkland, the Brocas on the Eton side 
 and the Home Park on the Windsor side.
 Here people picnic,play games or      
 paddle in the river.                  
  There are several locks along this   
 section of the river. One is Romney   
 lock which stands by Romney Island, an
 attractive island in the river which  
 separates the wear  stream from the   
 lock stream.
