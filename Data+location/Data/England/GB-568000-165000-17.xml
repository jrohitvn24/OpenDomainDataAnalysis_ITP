		<content>{Starkey Castle}is a fourteenth        
 century{manor house.}It is in very bad
 condition inside and is in the process
 of being restored by a retired        
 barrister,{Mr Gerald Davies.} At the  
 moment there is still scaffolding in  
 the Great Hall because the roof is    
 being repaired.  There is a chapel on 
 the first floor which has a modernised
 stained glass window in it. On the    
 ground floor the rooms have been      
 plastered by a machine which sprays   
 plaster. The outside is in quite good 
 condition. The building itself is made
 out of{Kentish ragstone and flint.} Mr
 Davies is interested in old buildings 
 and once it is restored completely he 
 is going to live in it.  He hopes to  
 use the Great Hall for concerts and   
 exhibitions in order to pay for the   
 restoration.
