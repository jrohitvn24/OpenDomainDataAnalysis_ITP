		<content> WITHIN THE AREA ARE PLACES OF NATURAL 
 BEAUTY. THE WOODED AREA OF LANGDON    
 HILLS IS A POPULAR SPOT AND WAS       
 RECENTLY DESIGNATED AS A COUNTRY PARK,
 AND EXTENSIVELY DEVELOPED BY THE LOCAL
 COUNCIL. IN 1981 A NATURE TRAIL       
 THROUGH THE SOUTH-WEST OF THE AREA WAS
 OPENED AND THIS PASSES THROUGH TWO    
 NATURE RESERVES. PICNIC AREAS WITH    
 SEATS HAVE BEEN PROVIDED ALONG THE    
 WAY, AND THE HOLE AREA IS CARED FOR BY
 A RESIDENT WARDEN, AND IS PROVING TO  
 BE A POPULAR ATTRACTION FOR BOTH LOCAL
 INHABITANTS AND VISITORS FROM AS FAR  
 AFIELD AS LONDON.
