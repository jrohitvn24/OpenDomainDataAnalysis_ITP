		<title>04RECREATION. (BMX bikes).</title>
		<content>     {BMX}is short for{British Motor   
{Cross}and is a new form of bike-riding
 which requires a{modified bicycle     
 which resembles a miniature trials    
 bike. You require a bike which has the
 proper{racing handlebars, seat,       
{pedals, and frame.}If you are going   
{racing}you need a{helmet, gloves,     
{padded trousers,}and a{jacket.        
      The{nearest track}to us is       
{Margrove Park}(654160), there are also
 tracks at Saltburn and Brotton. The   
 Margrove Park track is for{racing     
 which takes place{every Sunday,}about 
 15 races according to age. At the     
 industrial estate near our school,    
 a lot of people practice{free-styling.
      The{cost}of such a bike ranges   
{from Â£100 to Â£1000.}The more expensive
 bikes are used for racing as they are 
 lighter and also have stronger frames.
