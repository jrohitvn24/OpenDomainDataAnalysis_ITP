		<content> This block covers an area to the North
 of the market town of{Wimborne        
{Minster.}There are a number of small  
 villages and several farms.Much of the
 area is covered by a non-statutory    
 Green Belt Policy.This allows the     
 Local Ditrict Council some control    
 over development in the area.         
  Many of the buildings still have     
 traditional thatched roofs and there  
 is an obvious attempt to blend new    
 with old.                             
  The use of farmland and the type of  
 farming has changed in recent         
 years.There has been a swing away from
 mixed farming towards more specialised
 farming,particularly arable and       
 cattle farming.Some farmers now lease 
 large acreages to their neighbours and
 maintain only a small proportion of   
 their original landholding.
