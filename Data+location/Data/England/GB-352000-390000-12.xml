		<content> STUART'S FAVOURITE GAME               
 is 'skilly'. "In this game there are  
 two teams each with ten people in. One
 team runs away the other team counts  
 to ten and then they try to catch the 
 other team.  When they do they say    
 'skilly one, two, three, caught by me,
 no escapes.' That person is then taken
 back to base.  When all the team is   
 caught the team that was chasing in   
 the first game then becomes the       
 chasers.                              
 OTHER CHILDREN'S FAVOURITE GAMES      
 "We like to play racing games.  We    
 line up and someone says 'Go' and we  
 run to a finish line.  The lst. person
 past the line is the winner.          
 We sometimes have hopping, skipping,  
 and bouncing a ball while we are      
 running races.
