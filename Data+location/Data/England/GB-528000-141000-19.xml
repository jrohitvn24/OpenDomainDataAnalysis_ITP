		<title>19HORLEY SPORTS CLUBS</title>
		<content>  There are lots of different sports   
 clubs available to the people of      
 Horley such as hockey, tennis and     
 Squash, but only the football club is 
 actually situated in our allocated    
 area. Horley Town Football Club was   
 formed in 1898. The present ground was
 donated to the club by Major Jennings 
 at the end of the second world war.   
 The club now has over two hundred     
 members playing in six teams. Out     
 ofthese six teams three are for       
 children. The senior teams not only   
 play in local leagues but sometimes   
 travel up to two and a half hours to  
 reach a match. Apart from the teams   
 there is a committee and work force of
 groundsmen, stewards, caterers and    
 team managers which in total involve  
 about thirty local people.
