		<title>06KENDERCHURCH CHURCH</title>
		<content> The church is a local landmark,       
 situated on a hill above the A465     
 road. Its circular churchyard         
 indicates that it has been a place of 
{worship}for over 1000 years, and a    
 legacy prevented closure in 1977.     
 Since then, monthly services, attended
 by about twelve people, have been held
 from Easter to October, and there have
 been two christenings in the chalice  
 shaped{Norman font.}                  
                                       
 From the churchyard, which contains an
 incised slab of Norman times and a    
 cross with a medievel base, there os a
 fine view of the{Golden Valley}which  
 still glows with corn in the summer   
 months.                               
 It seems that the church has survived 
 through the dedicated farmers and     
 their friends who care for the church 
 as well as their land.                </content>
