		<title>15Church Farm, Claines</title>
		<content> Mr Peter Philips owns the farm in     
 partnership with his son, Peter. The  
 family has owned the farm since 1900. 
 There are 550 acres. Crops grown      
 include sugar beet, fodder beet,      
 barley, potatoes, sprouts, beans,     
 cabbages, cauliflowers and peas. Beef 
 cattle are kept, the calves being     
 bought at a week old and fattened for 
 market. Five people work on the farm. 
 Work begins at 7.30 am, lunch is 1 to 
 2 pm and finishes at 5 pm. The        
 farmworkers have 4 weeks' holiday per 
 year. They need special clothing for  
 wet weather and for spraying          
 chemicals. The farmer keeps a record  
 of what he does in a large diary.     
 There are five farmhouses, twenty     
 barns and buildings and seven tractors
 in use. There is also a great deal of 
 other machinery.
