   The Manor House in Scorton had      
 belonged for over three hundred years 
 to the Tancred family,and had later   
 become a boarding school for girls run
 by nuns of the Order of the Poor      
 Clares.In 1857 the nuns moved their   
 school to Darlington,and let the      
 buiding to a Mr.Pollock for use as a  
 boys' school until it was bought by   
 its present owners in 1880.           
   Brothers from France and Ireland    
 were invited by Father Henry Collins,a
 Cistercian monk,to see if the Manor   
 House would be suitable for them to   
 use as a house of hospitality.Although
 the property was out in the country   
 there was a railway station at Scorton
 and it was not far from the market    
 town of Richmond.Two rooms in the     
 house were turned into wards for the  
 old,crippled or infirm.               </content>
