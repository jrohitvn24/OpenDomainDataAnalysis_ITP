 EAST OF THE GRID WAS MENTIONED IN THE 
 ORIGINAL DOMESDAY BOOK,THE NAME       
 MEANING "WHEAT FIELDS".LAND AROUND THE
 VILLAGE WAS OWNED BY THE KING AND THE 
 ARCHBISHOP OF YORK.LONG BEFORE THAT   
 THE VILLAGE HAD BEEN ON THE ROUTE OF A
 ROMAN ROAD FROM LINCOLN TO DONCASTER, 
 INDEED IT IS THOUGHT THAT THE REMAINS 
 OF A VILLA ARE TO BE FOUND ON THE     
 VILLAGE FIELD.                        
 THE SETTLEMENT ITSELF CONTAINS MANY   
 OLD BUILDINGS. THERE WERE TWO         
 CHURCHES,ONLY ONE OF WHICH SURVIVES,  
 BOTH DATING FROM THE MIDDLE AGES.THEIR
 CONSTRUCTION WAS COMPLETED MUCH LATER 
 HOWEVER.                              
 THERE ARE MANY EXAMPLES OF OLD        
 PROPERTY WITHIN THE VILLAGE INCLUDING 
 THE OLD HALL WHICH BEARS THE DATE     
 1673.
