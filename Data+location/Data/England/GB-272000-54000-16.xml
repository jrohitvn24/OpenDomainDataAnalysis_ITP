		<content>{Riding}for the Disabled takes         
 place every Monday at half past       
 four until six o'clock.  All the      
 riders come from Dame Hannah Rodgers  
 School, Ivybridge.  It is a special   
 school for{disabled}people. The oldest
 rider is 16 years old and the youngest
 is 11 years old.  They have 18 adults,
 one to lead and two either side.  One 
 week they will go hacking and another 
 week they will go in the field.  There
 are six ponies, each pony is rode     
 twice.  Some children help with stable
{management}and some ride.  Many adults
 gladly give their time and help to    
 give the disabled children a happy    
 experience.
