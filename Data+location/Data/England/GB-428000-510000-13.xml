		<content> In Hurworth-on-Tees.Religion seems to 
 play little part in the lives of most 
 people today.Out of 250 primary       
 children asked, about 25% say bedtime 
 prayers, only 26 say grace at home.39 
 hadn't been baptised.There are over   
 500 children in Hurworth aged between 
 3 and 13 years, the ages for Sunday   
 Schools at Church and Chapel, but only
 59 of them attend.Each Sunday three   
 services are held in the Parish Church
 with a total attendance of 150.Two    
 services are held in the Methodist    
 Chapel with 36 attending, and one     
 service in the Roman Catholic Chapel  
 (St Cuthbert's Hospital) attended by  
 40 people.Congregations have more     
 older people in them and are larger on
 special occasions.The rector and      
 Methodist minister each look after    
 three other parishes.
