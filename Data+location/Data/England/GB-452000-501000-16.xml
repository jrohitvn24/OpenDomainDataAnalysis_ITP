		<title>16HANG GLIDING</title>
		<content> The sudden rise of the escarpment from
 the Tees river plain that forms the   
 Northern edge of the North Yorks Moors
 makes a site that is eminently        
 suitable for hang gliding. Any wind   
 from Northern points of the compass   
 results in a dramatic up-draught which
 is used to carry hang gliders high    
 above the edge. They can then circle  
 and fly for long periods before       
 landing in almost the same place as   
 they took off. Warm clothes are       
 essential for hang gliding, as is     
 reasonable visibility. We do not know 
 of any fatal accidents that have taken
 place in this area. There have been   
 complaints that hang gliders can      
 startle sheep carrying lambs and cause
 them to abort. Recently, stretches of 
 road have been fenced in order to     
 prevent parking on them by those      
 wanting access to Carlton Bank.       </content>
