		<content>   The JET  project is aimed at proving
 the feasibility of nuclear fusion as a
 new energy source.  The members of the
 JET Joint Undertaking are the European
 Atomic  Energy  Community,  all  its  
 associated  partners  on  the  fusion 
 programme  along  with Greece, Ireland
 and  Luxembourg.  The  project  was   
 established  in  1978  for a period of
 twelve years.                         
                                       
                                       
   The  aim  of the  JET  project is to
 obtain a plasma  with  a size, density
 and  temperature  comparable  to  the 
 values  needed  in  an  eventual power
 producing  reactor.  Achieving  the   
 required plasma on JET will be a major
 step forward, but many other difficult
 problems  will  have  to  be  overcome
 before an economic  fusion reactor can
 be built.                             </content>
