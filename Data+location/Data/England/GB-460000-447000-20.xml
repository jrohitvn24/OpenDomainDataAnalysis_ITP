		<title>20Coming to live in Fulford</title>
		<content> Fulford Primary School has 240 pupils,
 my old school of Ulleskelf had 30. My 
 house cost Â£60,000 even though we sold
 our old one for Â£50,000 which was the 
 same size. This is because Fulford is 
 a popular area to live in, being close
 to York Univesity, where a lot of     
 people work, and the A64, a major road
 leading to the coast and large cities 
 like Leeds. Fulford itself is a very  
 attractive village. It started off    
 near the River Ouse but has now spread
 rapidly over the surrounding area.    
 Within its boundaries it contains two 
 schools , Fulford C.E School for      
 chidren aged 5-11 yrs and Fulford     
 Comprehensive for children from 11-16 
 yrs. Parents, when interviewed, said  
 that the schooling offered by Fulford 
 Comprehensive was a major             
 consideration in coming to live in    
 Fulford.                              </content>
