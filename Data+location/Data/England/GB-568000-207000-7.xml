		<content>   The playgrounds of old schools were 
 small and there were no fields for    
 games. The old people told us that    
 their teachers were very strict and   
 quite often hit children for getting  
 their work wrong when they did not    
 understand it. Our teachers are more  
 understanding. They allow us to       
{experiment for ourselves}and discuss  
 our work with other children. Talking 
 was never allowed in school fifty     
 years ago. We{learn by experience.}We 
 use{practical ideas}to help us to     
 understand our work and we are allowed
 to{write our own views}about all the  
 work that we do.                      
   We think we would not have liked    
 school fifty years ago. It seemed very
 strict and the teachers were too hard 
 on the children. I think we are very  
 lucky today compared with fifty years 
 ago.                                  </content>
