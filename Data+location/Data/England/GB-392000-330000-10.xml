		<title>10BUS ROUTES, BURSTON AREA</title>
		<content>                                       
The whole of the area is served by a   
very limited form of Public Transport. 
Although the village is situated on a  
main road,there is only a service into 
Stafford for workers each morning and  
returning in the evening.The last bus  
leaves at 5.00pm. There is a daytime   
service on two days each week for      
shoppers.                              
                                       
There is no official service on any of 
the other roads,but members of the     
public are allowed to use the school   
children's transport on a Friday       
morning.This means that when the       
schools are on holiday the outlying    
districts are completely cut off and   
have to rely on neighbours who have    
their own transport.
