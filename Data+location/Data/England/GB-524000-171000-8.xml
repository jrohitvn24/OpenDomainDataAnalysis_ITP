		<title>08Travel in a London suburb</title>
		<content>Our part of London is a commuter area. 
Tube trains from Wimbledon Park station
run to London or Wimbledon every       
fifteen minutes and usually have four  
carriages.Now that smoking is banned   
they are much cleaner.The area also has
the Southern Railway so it is easy to  
get to London to catch  long-distance  
trains.Buses go along three main roads 
leading to London and often run late   
because of traffic jams in Wansworth   
and Wimbledon.Buses make me late for   
school so though most girls come in    
cars or buses I use my bike.It is a    
racer with five gears.I ride down side 
roads lined with cars but in one street
the Council have cut pieces out of the 
pavement so that cars can park off the 
road.In the main road the lorries and  
cars spread fumes as they go past.Even 
so,bikes are the easiest way to travel.
