		<title>20SCHOOL HOLIDAY.1985</title>
		<content> This year both the 3rd and the 4th    
 years have had a weeks working holiday
 in North Wales with the school. We    
 were each given a red binder full of  
 questionaires and pictures to colour  
 and we filled it in when we came back.
 We were all very busy the week after -
 drawing pictures,answering questions  
 and doing lots of writing about each  
 place we visited.My favourite place   
 was Trefriw Woollen Mill which rests  
 on the river Crafnant.We went to lots 
 of places on our visit to North Wales 
 like Swallow Falls,Caernarvon and     
 Conway Castles,Rhyl Sun Centre,a Slate
 Quarry,A Farm on Anglesey,Penrhos     
 Nature Reserve and lots of others. The
 total cost was Â£52.00.Next year the   
 group are hoping to go to North       
 Yorkshire.
