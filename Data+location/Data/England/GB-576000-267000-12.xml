		<title>12A Farm Visit</title>
		<content>When we were in the little class we    
went on a visit to Heath Barn Farm to  
see the lambing.We all got in the coach
and Charlie drove us right up to the   
farm along the Cavenham Road.We saw    
lots of lambs and Mr Bonaparte,the farm
manager,told us all about them.We saw  
some who had no mother and when it was 
all over we all took a lambs tail back 
to school because they docked them.Then
Mr Bonaparte had bought us some        
lemonade and crisps so we all had a    
drink and a packet of crisps.It was    
good.
