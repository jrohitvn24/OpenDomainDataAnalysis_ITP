		<content> FARMING IN BIGGIN HILL                
                                       
 Milking Lane is a beef fatening and   
 cereal farm covering 363 acres, 250 of
 which are rented from the Biggin Hill 
 airport authority.  They keep 200     
 cattle mainly Charolais, Blond        
 Aquitaines and Herefords.  They are   
 fed on silage and cereal in the winter
  and sold off at regular intervals.   
 they grow wheat and oats for sale in  
 the open market and barley for fodder.
       A typical year for the farmer   
 starting in September would be to     
 plough and set the winter cereals; buy
 the cattle in October and feed and    
 look after them in the winter months. 
 In february the organic and inorganic 
 fertilizers are spread on the cereals 
 and the grass.  In May the grass is   
 cut to make silage.  The cereals are  
 harvested from late July to August.   </content>
