		<title>05A morning in Marnhull</title>
		<content>  It was 6.50 on a Friday morning.I put
 on my light and read my Secret Seven  
 book till 7.00am.I got up,did my      
 hair and went down stairs to have     
 breakfast. I saw the paper in the     
 door. I looked for Pop Panel-it was   
 Nik Kershaw! I shouted to my sister,  
 and she cut it out.It was about his   
 song "The Riddle".My sister made up   
 her porridge and I had my medicine and
 branflakes.We did our teeth and       
 faces.My sister read the paper for a  
 while and then went to get her        
 bus.                                  
 I settled down in a chair and read    
 my great book.When my mother came home
 from work at 8.30-she's a nurse-she   
 tested me on my spellings.I got my    
 sewing,put it in my bag and went to   
 school.                               
                                       
                                       </content>
