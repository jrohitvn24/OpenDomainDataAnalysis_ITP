		<title>18Wild Flowers In Stickney.</title>
		<content> In Stickney there is a Picnic Area,and
 there are alot of trees,grass,wild    
 flowers and animals.The Picnic Area   
 once had a railway running through it,
 with a meadow by its side.On the other
 side of the road there was the railway
 station, where there was another      
 meadow.This has now been dug up,and   
 sold for farm land.We visited the     
 Picnic Area to see what we could find.
 We concentrated on wild flowers.These 
 are some that we found.               
 Dog Rose,             Yarrow,         
 Black Medic,          Correl Grass,   
 Cudweed,              Goats Beard,    
 Horse Tail,           Pineapple Weed, 
 Oat Grass,   Common Spotted Orchid,   
  Good Friday Grass,                   
 Green Veined Orchid,                  
 Our favourite weed was the Pineapple  
 Weed,because when you squeezed it ever
 so hard you got a smell of Pineapple. </content>
