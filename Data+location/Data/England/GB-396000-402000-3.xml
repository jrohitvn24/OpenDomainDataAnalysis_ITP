		<content>  Saddleworth Rangers have been playing
 Rugby League in Greenfield for over 50
 years and have developed from a Club  
 having one team to having first class 
 facilities for seven teams from under 
 elevens to Open Age. Originally with  
 the Oldham League, they expanded into 
 the Pennine League which was a founder
 member of the British Amateur Rugby   
 League Association which severed the  
 administrative links with the         
 professional game. Many players have  
 gone on to play in the professional   
 ranks but the character of Rangers has
 always been to promote 'Rugby League  
 for all' and to change the image of   
 the game from 'flat cap and tin baths'
 to one of first class playing and     
 social facilities.
