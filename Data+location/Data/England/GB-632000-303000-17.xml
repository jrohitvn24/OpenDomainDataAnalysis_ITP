		<title>17BUCKENHAM CHURCH</title>
		<content> Buckenham Church is what as known as a
 redundant Church_as it is now only    
 used once a year.It has been restored 
 and is maintained in good order.The   
 present vicar is one of a team that   
 work on a circuit_working on an       
 regular basis in active churches;in   
 this case,in Brundall area.The church 
 was once regularly attended_serving   
 the dispersed farming community.Its   
 bell,which was of special historical  
 interest has been stolen.One of its   
 former rectors,the Rev. Beauchamp;    
 obviously can be linked to thepublic  
 house across the river,the Beauchamp  
 Arms.Both sides of the river were     
 linked at one stage by ferry.
