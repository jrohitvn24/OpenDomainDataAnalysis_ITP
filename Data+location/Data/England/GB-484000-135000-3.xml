		<title>03Animals At Home</title>
		<content>      Our family lives in the country  
 and we own a{dog,}two{rabbits,}seven  
{guinea pigs,}sixteen{ducks,}four      
{chickens}and some{goldfish.           
      In the morning my dad feeds all  
 the animals, and I do it in the       
 afternoon. The{dog}gets fed once a    
 day, and must always have clean       
 water(like all the animals). My dad   
 takes our dog for a walk twice a      
 day. The{rabbits}have got a run that  
 they are let into during the day. They
 are shut in their hutch at night. The 
{guinea pigs}sometimes have bread and  
 milk. The{ducks}are fed chicken food  
 and we often give them grass. My dad  
 made them a pond and we clean it out  
 each month. They have got a hutch to  
 shelter in. It is cleaned out each    
 week.
