		<title>05Farming in the Area</title>
		<content> The farms in this area vary in size   
 between about 40 acres to about 800   
 acres. Temple House Farm is next to   
 our school. The farmer grows grass    
 for his dairy cows.                   
 They graze in the grass in summer and 
 other fields are mown by a machine and
 harvested to be made into silage to   
 feed his 200 cows in the winter.      
                          Other farms  
 in the area keep flocks of sheep.They 
 produce fat lambs and wool which is   
 sent to the wool marketing board who  
 grade it and then it is made into     
 clothes. Another farm in the area only
 grows potatoes,wheat,barley and oats. 
 My farm,Temple Farm,buys calves and   
 store cattle.We grow barley,wheat,oats
 and sweetcorn maize to feed cattle.   
 We have a man who comes and grinds up 
 all of the corn ready for cattle to   
 eat.                                  </content>
