		<content>  This block for the Domesday Book has 
 been written by the members of the Old
 Headington Women's Institute.         
 Originally started in Rural Areas,    
 this is a women's group who meet      
 monthly to hear an interesting lecture
 and for social intercourse. They are  
 interested in the lives of everybody  
 in the community and in broadening    
 their educational horizons.           
  The Women's Institutes are part of a 
 National Federation which exerts      
 influence on national politics by the 
 Resolutions which they discuss once a 
 year at the Albert Hall in London.    
  The National Federation is affiliated
 to the Associated Countrywomen of the 
 World.
