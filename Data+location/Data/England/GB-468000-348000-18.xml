		<title>18YOUNG PEOPLE'S LEISURE</title>
		<content>   The teens and pre-teens make no     
 bones about putting down{T.V.watching,
 but even they seem to think that this 
 passive activity is less worthy than  
 playing{sport}:virtually all are      
 active in some branch or another even 
 though this means travelling "abroad".
   There are local{Guides}and{Brownies}
 and{Youth Clubs}in both villages.     
   Just as parents underestimate their 
 T.V. leisure so the pre-teens fail to 
 realise how much time they spend      
 just{"playing".}                      
   It is hardly surprising, but nonthe-
 less significant, that many of the    
 young are interested and active in    
 their parents' chosen leisure.So some 
 list walking,gardening,shopping and   
 bird watching.The ones active in music
 making have musical parents.          
   Few give reading any importance. A  
 sign of the times-computing is listed.</content>
