 All Saints Church stands in the centre
 of Lanchester.We visited the church.  
 It was built of stone about 850 years 
 ago.It is older than Durham Cathedral.
 The original church was built by the  
 Normans.The large arch leading to the 
 chancel is decorated.The original

 church was enlarged with stones       
 from the Roman fort at Lanchester it  </content>
