		<content> Belper waste factory recycles paper   
 glass,plastic, and textiles,the       
 material is brought in and sorted into
 groups ready to be recycled, and now  
 the brick works is part of Belper     
 waste.The Derbyshire highways chemical
 plant tests building materials for    
 places such as fire stations,         
 hospitals, schools and roads.They test
 the strength of bricks, concrete,     
 slabs, clay, tarmac and soil.At the   
 Depot they also repaired buses,       
 library vans, and lorries. At the     
 sawmills they make pine kitchen units,
 stairs and window frames. They use old
 wood that is 200 years old, because it
 is much harder than new pine.The      
 plastic factory makes plastic fencing 
 and runners for kitchen drawers, and  
 plant rings and labels.It brought the 
 raw plastic in, and manufactured it.
