		<content>  One of the main problems in our area 
 is the lack of parking facilities. We 
 have only two main car parks, both    
 behind our two supermarkets.In our    
 shopping area many streets have double
 yellows lines,this prohibits much     
 useful parking area.                  
                                       
  The main street,Barnsley Road,is     
 extremely busy.It is so hazardous that
 three pedestrian crossings are        
 required within a distance of 300m.   
                                       
  Many shops have no rear access, hence
 deliveries have to be made on the main
 street.                               
                                       
  If our area is to keep abreast with  
 the demands of today's shopping       
 public, deep consideration must be    
 given to a more stream-lined parking  
 system.                               </content>
