		<title>03BRIGHSTONE TEA GARDENS</title>
		<content>  Near the centre of Brighstone village
 are the tea gardens,a popular tourist 
 attraction with its own car park big  
 enough for four or five coaches at one
 time! When you have taken your seats a
 waitress comes and takes your order   
 for refreshments. We asked some       
 customers some questions.These are    
 shown below with the most common      
 answers.                              
{ Where are you from?}West Midlands    
{ Who are you with?}A coach party of   
 friends.                              
{ Have you brought your car? }No.      
{ Where are you staying? }Shanklin.    
{ Have you come here before? }No.      
{ Will you buy souvenirs here at the   
{tea gardens in their little shop? }Yes
 but everything is rather expensive for
 pensioners.                           
  A cream tea here costs Â£1.80
