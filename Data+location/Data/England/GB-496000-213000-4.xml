		<content> There are 21 bungalows in Bede Court  
 specialy built for old people with a  
 warden to watch over them. There are  
 other semi-detached 3-bedroom Council 
 houses in other parts of the village. 
   Along the green and in the woods are
 houses once belonging to the Ashridge 
 Estate. Many have a stone showing the 
 coat of arms of Lord Brownlow. Red    
 bricks are mainly used on the old     
 houses and lighter coloured ones on   
 new.                                  
   There are very large houses,        
 especially in the secluded parts, with
 tennis courts etc. Many houses have   
 had extensions and house prices have  
 rocketed 1000% in the past 50 years.  
 Local youngsters cannot afford to buy 
 a dwelling here.                      
 Farmhouses look prosperous and the    
 whole area has a well-kept appearance.
