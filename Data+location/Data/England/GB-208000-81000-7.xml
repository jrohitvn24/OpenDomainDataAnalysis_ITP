		<title>07OLD PLACE NAMES</title>
		<content> There are many old Cornish named      
 places.Here are a few of them in old  
 Cornish:Camelford=ford across the     
 (river)with a bent estuary,           
 Meadowcroft = a piece of rock in the  
 middle of a field.                    
 Valley Truckle= tucking mill          
 Cornwall = Kernow.                    
 Lanteglos = a church in a valley.     
 There are many others as well.        
 These places are all in in our        
 D-block.Some of the names are very    
 different from 1086.                  
 I have been researching them in an    
 old Cornish dictionary.               
 Cornish is not used any more because  
 English was the language used in      
 business, in law and in the church.   
 Cornish has not been spoken for 100   
 years,although a few odd words are    
 still used.
