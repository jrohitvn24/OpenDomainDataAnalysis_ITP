		<title>16  GETTING TO SCHOOL</title>
		<content> Most children travel to school by bus.
 Some use taxis and private cars. The  
 buses travel along very complicated   
 routes because the roads are narrow   
 and the hills are steep.              
 Children live in lonely places and go 
 to seven different schools. Three     
 bus companies do all the official     
 transport. Two use coaches which      
 cannot travel far from the main road, 
 (A39). The third uses minibuses and a 
 taxi to collect isolated children from
 the hills. All the buses have to      
 connect with each other so that no one
 is late for school. The minibuses are 
 garaged at{Withycombe}and travel over 
 800 miles a week, using 54 gallons of 
 fuel. This is a lot because they      
 travel slowly on rough roads.         
{Roadwater}is the meeting point for    
 most of the transport and it is a very
 busy village between 8 and 8.30a.m.   </content>
