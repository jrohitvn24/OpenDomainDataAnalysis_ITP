 The original village of Wyberton is   
 grouped around St Leodegar's church   
 and Wyberton park ,which is now a     
 large country house but was once the  
 home of the Rector of Wyberton.It is a
 residential village,having no         
 amenities except  a telephone kiosk   
 and a pillar box .Until thirty years  
 ago the school was in the village.In  
 1955 a new school was opened in the   
 parish close to a large new residental
 area near the A16 which runs from     
 Boston to Spalding.This new school is 
 outside the section covered by this   
 survey.The village has developed      
 rapidly along the A16 and the old part
 has been left  as a dormitary village 
 .Most of the people who live there    
 work in nearby Boston.There has been  
 private non-estate building in the    
 past 15 yrs but the village is compact</content>
