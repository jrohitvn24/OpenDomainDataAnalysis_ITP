		<content> 1.The hill the village stood on was   
 covered with forest which reached as  
 far as the parish church in           
 Bradford.It was probably called       
{"Eagle's Hill".}                      
 2.Another theory is that the name came
 from the word{'eclesia'}which means   
 church in latin.A church may have     
 stood on the hill.Human bones have    
 been found which suggests a graveyard.
 3.There is a theory that it might have
 been named after an{Anglo-Saxon }     
 settler called{Eckil.}The owner of the
 next manor of Bolton was Archil, who  
 might have been Eckil's brother.      
    We thought the second explanation  
 was best because of bones being found.
   {Eccleshill}had three carucates of  
 land as described in the{Domesday Book
  compiled in 1086.A carucate was as   
 much land as a team of oxen ploughed  
 in a year.                            </content>
