		<title>05THE BRICKWORKS AT MOSS</title>
		<content> Near{Moss}there are the remains of the
 old{brickworks.}These were built in   
 the early 1700's and closed down in   
 the 1920's. The tall{chimney}with the 
 words 'MOSS BRICKS' towers above the  
 surrounding flat farm land. There are 
 3{kilns}remaining, one is in ruins and
 shows the burnt bricks, one is empty  
 and the last is full of bricks that   
 were never fired. The{quarry}has now  
 flooded and has been stocked with{fish
 for the local fishing club. It is a   
 source of{wild flowers}such as water  
 lilies, irises, deadly nightshade and 
 campion.{Swifts}can be seen swooping  
 above the surface of the lake.
