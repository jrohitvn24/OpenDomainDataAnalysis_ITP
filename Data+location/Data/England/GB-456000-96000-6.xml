      We know that in the l840's that  
 at 'Camp Browndown',some German       
 Militia were occupying the camp. They 
 had lost their nationality by fighting
 for the British in the Napoleonic Wars
 some 25 years earlier. These          
 mercenaries proved to be a headache to
 the authorities and in the end were   
 married off in batches of twenty to   
 the local ladies of Portsmouth!       
      Between the l860's and 1890's the
 range was altered considerably, and   
 the whole range was redesigned.       
      All that is left today are two   
 huge sea facing gun emplacements. The 
 range is still a very popular training
 ground for all elements of the Armed  
 Forces.It is also a S.S.I.            </content>
