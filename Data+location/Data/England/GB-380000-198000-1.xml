		<content>   The area we are studying is in the  
 county of{Gloucestershire.} It is     
 situated in the{Cotswold Hills.}      
   The Cotswold Hills are formed of    
 limestone. Limestone is grey,white or 
 yellow.It is sometimes very hard.It is
 made out of layers.Limestone rock is  
 made from the skeletons of a great    
 number of marine creatures. It may    
 have fossils in it.                   
   The height of the land rises from{  
{200}to{760}feet above sea level.The   
 area has many wells and springs.      
   The area is mainly farmland.There   
 are a few villages nestling between   
 the hills.                            
   There is some woodland which is made
 up of deciduous and coniferous trees. 
   There are a few country roads along 
 the valley bottoms.                   
  In a field there are a few mounds,   
 the remains of{Kinley Priory}(Saxon). </content>
