		<content>    Originally Hussey's was the village
 bakery (map ref 554.613) of Ashford   
 Hill. It now supplies bread and cakes 
 to a wide surrounding area including  
 Basingstoke. Fifteen vans deliver     
 bread to shops and factories. In      
 addition fresh cream cakes,doughnuts  
 and cakes for special occasions are   
 made (Christmas etc.).There are seven 
 steam ovens and the workers do two    
 shifts- night and day.   The most     
 popular loaf is known as a Bloomer and
 the most popular cake is the Lardy.   
    Flour is delivered once a week and 
 comes from Rank-Hovis-MacDougall.
