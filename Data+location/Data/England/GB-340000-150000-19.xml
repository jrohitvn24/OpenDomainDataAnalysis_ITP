		<title>19Changes in Milk Production</title>
		<content> Twenty five years ago in Chapel       
 Allerton there were 24 farms producing
 milk but now there are only three.    
 Manor Farm is one of these. The cows  
 were multi-purpose shorthorns and were
 milked by hand. It took 4 men to milk 
 the 80 cows then but now with machines
 to help only one man is needed. The   
 shorthorns have been replaced by      
 Friesians and the milk is stored in   
 large containers and not collected    
 daily in churns.In the Winter the cows
 were kept in pens and fed with hay,   
 but now they stay in large cubicles   
 and are fed with silage,cowcake and   
 beet.                                 
   Mangols were grown in the fields 25 
 years ago and the weeds were kept     
 clear by a man with a push hoe.Now    
 weed killers are used and a greater   
 variety of crops are grown.
