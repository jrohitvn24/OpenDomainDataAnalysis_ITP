		<content> Of the people we asked to fill in a   
 questionaire on employment, 80.6% were
 either in full or part time           
 employment. Of those, 6.9% were self  
 employed and 3.4% did seasonal work.  
 These were mainly fairground people   
 who come to the area during the winter
 months. 62% worked normal hours, 24%  
 worked shifts and 14% worked nights,  
 surprisingly only 28% said they were  
 the only wage earner in their family. 
 90% get paid weekly. 28% had worked   
 more than ten years in the same job.  
 The same percentage had worked between
 five to ten years. 31% had been one to
 five years in the same job and only   
 14% had worked less than one year in  
 their present occupation. 41% worked  
 locally. 52% travelled two to ten     
 miles and 7% travelled more than 10   
 miles. 29% of the unemployed had been 
 on a retraining scheme.               </content>
