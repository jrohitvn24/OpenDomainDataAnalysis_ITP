    Our village policeman is called    
P.C. Dale. We went to talk to him at   
the Police Station in the village.     
    He has to patrol the villages of   
Mawdesley, Eccleston and Rufford. The  
last policeman stayed here for two     
years, but there is no set period of   
time for length of service.            
    When P.C. Dale is not on duty, the 
policeman from Croston or Eccleston    
looks after the village. He owns his   
own car but the police service pays for
his petrol. He works under two police  
sergeants in Coppull. The main crimes  
in this area are wilful damage caused  
by young people and the occasional     
burglary committed by people from      
outside the area. If an arrest is made,
the person is taken to Chorley and     
appears at the Magistrates Court. P.C. 
Dale hopes to stay here a long time.   </content>
