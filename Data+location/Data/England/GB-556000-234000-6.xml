		<title>06School Day at Wimbish</title>
		<content> We have some breakfast and then get   
 ready for school. In our school we    
 wear school uniform. Some of us travel
 to school by bus, some go by car and  
 others walk. School starts at         
 9.10.a.m. In school the teacher calls 
 the register and then we have         
 Assembly. After this, we have lessons 
 such as Mathematics or English. On    
 Wednesday mornings we go swimming and 
 on Thursdays we have cookery. Our     
 morning is broken up by a 15 minute   
 playtime when we can buy tuck, but    
 then we work again until lunch time at
 12 noon. We eat our lunches, then we  
 play with our friends or go to        
 recorder or guitar lessons. School    
 starts again at 1.30 p.m. We have more
 lessons such as craft, games or       
 projects. Project is a chosen subject 
 that we have to find out about. We go 
 home at 3.40.p.m.                     </content>
