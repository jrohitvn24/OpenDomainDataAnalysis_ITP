		<title>12ALL SAINT'S CHURCH.....</title>
		<content>  All Saints church is in the parish of
 Speke.  It has a good congregation,and
 an experienced  vicar - Reverend Amos.
   Work on the church began in 1871,the
 church  having been a place of worship
 for over 100 years.  It has had only 8
 vicars in that time-they must have all
 liked working there.                  
       During that time there have been
 2,390 weddings, 4,239 christenings and
 711 funerals.                         
  Sadly there is a lot of vandalism,the
 church-hall   needs  a  lot  of  money
 spending on it,and the lych-gate needs
 repair.The church itself is a compact,
 homely   building  with  a   welcoming
 atmosphere.                           
    Joy Simson is the organist,she also
 teaches the choir of over 20. Reverend
 Amos  has   4  robes   for   different
 occasions,and enjoys "All Saints".
