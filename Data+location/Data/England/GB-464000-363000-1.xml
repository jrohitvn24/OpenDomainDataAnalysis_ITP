 Abbey estate and is still dominated by
 the ruined abbey.The ruin and         
 grounds belong now to the             
 Nottinghamshire County coucil and are 
 managed by their leisure sevices      
 committee.  This is now a Country Park
 and is being developed as a tourist   
 attraction adjacent to Sherwood       
 Forest. There is a lake,arboretum,    
 ecuipture gardens, and in the old     
 stable block, a craft centre,         
 restaurant and gallery.  to the south 
 of the Abbey grounds is a residential 
 development of about 40 houses.  The  
 rest of the area consists mainly of   
 three abby farms which are now        
 privately owned.  they are largely    
 arable and grow sugar beet and oil    
 seed rape.  There is also some        
 pheasant shooting.
