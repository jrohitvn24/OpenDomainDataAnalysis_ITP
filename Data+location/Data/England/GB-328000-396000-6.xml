{Recreation:Swimming Baths             
  Crosby Baths were opened in 1963 and 
 the sea-water was used to fill the    
 pools.The baths were three times more 
 popular than they are today.We asked  
 how many people came in a week;there  
 are about 3382 swimmers and 142       
 spectators.The main age group are     
 teenagers and nearly twice as many    
 males swim than females;43 schools    
 come to swim during the week and Galas
 are often held at the baths. During   
 the school holidays the busiest day is
 Wednesday.It costs more to swim at the
 weekend than in the week.             
   The large  pool is 110 feet long and
 54 feet wide,whilst the learner pool  
 is 66 feet long and 25 feet wide.There
 are diving boards.Cleaning takes five 
 hours a day.Water is constantly       
 filtered and kept at 83 degrees F.    </content>
