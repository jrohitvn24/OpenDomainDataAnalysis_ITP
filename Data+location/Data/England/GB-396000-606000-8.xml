 At  home  I  play  with  Mr  Pop,     
 Dentist,  and  Downfall with  my      
 sister . We  make  camps  and  play   
 in them. At school we  play  with     
 balls, skipping roops, and hoops. We  
 have a  farm yard, number rings,      
 Sorry, a  car set, Mancala, metal     
 puzzles and  Scrabble for Juniors.    
   The boys like to play with their toy
 farm machines in our sand             
 pit.Sometimes they kick a ball around 
 the yard.                             
   In the Summer time we have organised
 Rounders games on the school field,   
 usually when the older children from  
 Harbottle School are with us.         
   We have an annual Sports Day with   
 Harbottle School on our School field, 
 to which pre-school children and      
 parents join in.
