		<title>02DUFTON SHOP AS A LIVING</title>
		<content> After a year at the shop/Post Office, 
 the young couple with 2 children (7 &amp; 
 10) are pleased with their situation. 
 Finance is not easy,especially in a   
 bad summer,&amp; there is not much spare  
 time to enjoy walks together.But it is
 nice working at home because when the 
 shop is quiet,one of them can get on  
 with the chores,leaving them free to  
 go out after closing hours.They have  
 built up a good greengrocery line, as 
 the prices can be competitive.They    
 hope to go into takeaway foods for the
 summer visitors.The wife may look for 
 part-time work in winter to keep      
 busier;the village population is very 
 small.The husband would look after the
 shop.He likes the quiet life,having   
 worked in cities and been pensioned   
 off through injury.The children are at
 the excellent local school &amp; are happy
 there.                                </content>
