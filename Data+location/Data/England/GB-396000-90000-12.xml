 Saturday.  I get up and go downstairs 
 to watch the television until 10.00   
 when I go up to have a bath, dress and
 fetch my library books.  I go to the  
 library and change them.  Across the  
 road, I visit the baker for rolls and 
 cakes.  I go home to hoover and dust  
 for my pocket money then I help dad by
 washing people's hair and passing him 
 rollers.  At 12.00 I make myself a    
 sandwich and I go to my room to read  
 one of my books. After that I play    
 with my sister who is 2 and  I spend  
 the rest of the afternoon watching    
 television.  I write a story and then 
 it is teatime. Afterwards, I clear up 
 and go out in the garden to play ball 
 until mum calls me in to help put my  
 sister to bed.  I kiss her goodnight  
 and go to watch television until it is
 my turn to go to bed.                 </content>
