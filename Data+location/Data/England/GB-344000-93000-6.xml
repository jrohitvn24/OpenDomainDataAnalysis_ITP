 When it was a quarter past three we   
 packed up and sat on the carpet for a 
 story.  It was called{The Borrowers.  
 At half past three we got on the bus. 
 I sat with Kirsty.  When I got home I 
 saw my Mum and then she had to go out.
                                       
                                       
 My Dad came home and my cousin phoned 
 to say that we were going riding.  I  
 got Kas in and tacked up.  I met      
 Caroline, Vicki and Tracey on         
{Stonebarrow.                          
                                       
 Two hours later I was back home.  It  
 was eight o'clock. My Mum gave me some
 tea and I watched television for half 
 an hour.  We watched "Allo,Allo." When
 it ended we went to bed.              
                                       
                                       </content>
