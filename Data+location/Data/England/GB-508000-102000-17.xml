		<content>   When we look out of our windows at  
 John Selden First School, we see three
 different types of private housing. On
 two sides of the school field         
 semi-detached bungalows can be found. 
 On the Nelson Road side, where the    
 school entrance is, the housing is    
 made up of semi-detached and detached 
 houses.                               
   Most of the area has been built up  
 within the last 20 years.  To the     
 south of the school in the Maybridge  
 Estate, where many of our school      
 children live is council housing.  The
 houses are mostly semi-detached but   
 there are some terraced town houses.A 
 few purpose built flats can be seen in
 Goring Street at the west end of the  
 estate.                               
   North of the school all the houses  
 are privately owned.  Most of them are
 bungalows.                            </content>
