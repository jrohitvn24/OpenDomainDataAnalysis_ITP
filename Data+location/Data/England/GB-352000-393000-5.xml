		<content>     Residences  in  the  area  number 
 approximately five and a half thousand
 of which 1,800 are owner occupied, the
 rest rented  property, mostly  council
 housing.  Most  residences are houses,
 with  a  tiny  proportion of flats and
 maisonettes  but  no  high  rise flats
 whatever.  Of  the  owner-occupied    
 housing, 150 lacked a bathroom in 1981
 and 190 had no inside toilet. This is 
 an  indication  of  the  continued    
 existence of mid  to  late  nineteenth
 century  housing, despite a  clearance
 and  rebuilding  programme in the past
 decade. Other housing includes 1930's 
 semi-detached  and  modern  housing   
 estates,  both  private  and  council 
 property. Much of  the latter is town 
 housing  interspersed  with bungalows 
 for  older  people.  Many  of  the    
 redevelopment areas have been renamed 
 to give an appealing impression.      </content>
