		<title>13HOUSING IN WOLSTON</title>
		<content> Houses are a mixture of old and new   
 many{privately owned}. The two modern 
 estates on either side of the village 
 centre are mostly detached or         
 semi-detached houses or bungalows.    
 Some have loft extensions to make     
 extra rooms but all are neat and tidy 
 with colourful gardens.{Council houses
 were built in 1921 but some of these  
 have been sold to sitting tenants.    
 Others have been modernised. A newer  
 estate of rented accommodation has    
 been built in small blocks of         
 terraced housing opposite the first   
 school Annexe. There are some good    
 examples of{Victorian and Georgian}   
 houses originally owned by tradesmen. 
 Part of Frog Hall, on the A45 trunk   
 road, is 419 years old and was an old 
 coaching house.{Thatched cottages}add 
 to the charm of the village. New      
 housing is planned in Dyers Lane.     </content>
