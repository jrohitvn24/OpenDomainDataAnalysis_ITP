		<content>      To Muslim families in particular 
 integration is difficult. The girls   
 should remain veiled, and only have   
 contact with members of the immediate 
 family. Their limbs must remain       
 covered, even during physical         
 education lessons, which does not     
 enable them to participate in swimming
 lessons.                              
     Hindus, Sikhs and Muslims must    
 take care not to eat any forbidden{   
{foods.}This requires school kitchens  
 to have alternatives available. Some  
 Asian dishes are incorporated into    
 cookery lessons in schools. Fasting   
 takes place at special times as do    
 various festivals that occur          
 throughout the year.                  
      Each family decides how much or  
 how little they become involved in the
 'British' way of life.
