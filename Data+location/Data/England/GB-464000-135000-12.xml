		<title>12The Convent of St. Lucy.</title>
		<content>         The convent of St. Lucy is in 
 the centre of Medstead. It is a Roman 
 Catholic convent, and occupies a large
 house that used to be called Medstead 
 Manor. The Manor was bought in 1955 by
 the Maxwell family from Alresford who 
 then gave it to the Sisters. The      
 Sisters belong to the Religious       
 Teaching Order of St.Lucy Filippini.  
                                       
         The Order has 5 sisters, (3   
 American, 2 Italian) and runs a guest 
 house for old ladies which has 14     
 guests at the moment, and a Nursery   
 School for 45 children that was       
 opened in 1962.                       
                                       
         The convent has 30 acres of   
 land.
