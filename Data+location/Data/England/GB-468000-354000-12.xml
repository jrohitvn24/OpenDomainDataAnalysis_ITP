		<title>12NATURE TRAIL, SOUTHWELL (1)</title>
		<content> The{Southwell Trail}(an old{railway   
 line) runs from Southwell to          
 Farnsfield, passing through           
 Kirklington, a length of about 4      
 miles.  At Farnsfield, the warehouse  
 is still standing in the station yard,
 and the position of the sidings can   
 still be seen.  The station house,    
 booking hall and waiting room have    
 been converted into a private house.  
 The original buildings were completed 
 in 1871, and the platform was         
 dismantled in 1965.                   
   Just east of Farnsfield is the      
 Waterworks, built in 191O.  it pumped 
 water from Elkesley (12 miles north)  
 to Lincoln following the closure of   
 the local water supply there after a  
 typhoid epedemic.  Near here is Camp  
 Hill, the site of a Roman building.
