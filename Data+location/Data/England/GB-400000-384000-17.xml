		<title>17Shopping in New Mills</title>
		<content> There are two markets in New Mills.   
 One on Torr Top Street which is an    
 open market it opens on Friday and    
 Saturday.It sells things like fish and
 sometimes toys and games.People go    
 there because its very cheap.The other
 is an indoor market which is also very
 cheap.That sells more or less the same
 things.Most trade is done by normal   
 shops.                                
 We have a CO-OP by the outdoor market.
 There is a big car park down the road 
 from the CO-OP.It is a Pay and Display
 car park.                             
 Our main street is Market Street it   
 has about thirty shops on it.Union    
 Road comes a close second with about  
 twenty-five shops on it.Albion Road   
 has the only Swizzel Matlows in the   
 world producing 1000's of sweets in a 
 week.It produces sweets like          
 Refreshers and Love Hearts.           </content>
