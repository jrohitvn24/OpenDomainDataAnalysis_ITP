		<title>04TRADITIONAL FARMING PULHAM</title>
		<content> On some farms goats,donkeys,ponies &amp;  
 house cows are kept,1 farm breeds     
 Suffolk Punches.There are still many  
 barnyard poultry roaming freely.Free  
 range eggs are in great demand,but    
 these fowls are not just kept for     
 profit,they are almost part of the    
 family.Often they have names like 'the
 Mandarin'&amp;'Esmerelda',a Chinese gander
 &amp; his wife,she is over 25 yrs old &amp;   
 hasn't laid an egg for years,but they 
 enjoy a happy retirement on a small   
 farm that has become a wildlife       
 sanctuary &amp; a home for unwanted       
 livestock.There are old meadows,lots  
 of trees,hedges &amp; ponds where         
 everything can enjoy as natural a life
 as possible.Very little spraying or   
 mechanical hedge trimming is allowed. 
 Economically it may be crazy but it   
 does help to balance modern farming   
 methods.                              </content>
