 cricket, bat and ball, running games, 
 war, police, acton-man, cars, and

 We looked at games played in school.  
 The games that children liked best    
 were football, chainy and british     
 bulldog, and games children did not   
 like were road-runner, skipping and   
 hopscotch.                            
                                       
 In school children played games before
 school started in the morning, during 
 a fifteen minute break in the morning 
 and for about forty-five minutes at   
 lunchtime. In poor weather outside    
 games are restricted to the           
 playground, but in summer most        
 children chose to play on the school  
 field.
