		<title>19CHURCHES: DANE END &amp; AREA</title>
		<content>{All Saints Church}stands in the centre
 of the parish of Little Munden and    
 overlooks Dane End. Its partly        
 circular churchyard and ancient yew   
 tree may denote a pagan burial site.  
 The building is one of six            
 Hertfordshire churches that contain   
 visible Saxon work. It had a priest at
 the{Domesday Survey.}Nave and chancel 
 are late 11th century. Remains of a   
 solid Norman wall in the north west   
 corner suggest it then had a narrow   
 aisle.                                
{St. Catherine's Church}stands on a    
 hill over looking the village of      
{Sacombe.}It dates back to the 12th    
 century but Victorian restoration     
 hides the original structure. During  
 this restoration stained glass windows
 replaced the original windows and the 
 stone exterior was covered with flints
 taken from a local disused church.    </content>
