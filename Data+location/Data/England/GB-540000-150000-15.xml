		<title>15TRANSPORT IN HURST GREEN</title>
		<content>  Public transport in this area is     
 limited to bus, train and coach       
 services. Buses run every 15 minutes  
 and run services into and out of{Oxted
 and the surrounding area. The buses   
 are used by old people and people with
 out cars.                             
  An alternative to the buses is the   
 railway that runs from{Hurst Green}and
{Oxted}up to{London}and to{East        
{Grinstead in the other direction.}The 
 trains are used by commuters, shoppers
 and school children.                  
  The most popular type of transport   
 is cars. The industrial estate has    
 many heavy goods vehicles going to and
 from it. They use the small           
 surrounding lanes and there are many  
 complaints by local people because the
 lorries take up most of the roads.
