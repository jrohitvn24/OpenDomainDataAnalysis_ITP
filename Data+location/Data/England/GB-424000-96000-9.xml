		<content> A very impressive historic building   
 stands in the village of Sway on the  
 edge of the New Forest. Sway Tower,   
 which dominates the local landscape,  
 was built in the 1880's by Andrew     
 Peterson. It was one of the first     
 multi storey concrete structures to be
 built in Britain and stands 66.4464m  
 high. The solid concrete walls are    
 60cm thick at the bottom tapering to  
 30cm at the top. Concrete was mixed on
 site with stones from nearby Milford  
 beach then hauled up using a horse    
 powered hoist and tipped into the 45cm
 deep shuttering. When the concrete was
 dry the shuttering was moved up to the
 next level. No scaffolding was        
 used.Employment on the construction of
 the tower in the 1880's earned local  
 people 5s (25p) a day.
