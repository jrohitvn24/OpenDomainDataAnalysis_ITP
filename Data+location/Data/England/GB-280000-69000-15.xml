		<title>15WEST OGWELL</title>
		<content>   {West Ogwell}is a little hamlet in  
 South Devon near Newton Abbot.It has a
 little old church which has now been  
 retired.Next to the church is         
 convent,which used to be the manor,   
 built in the 15th century by a man    
 called{Thomas Reynell.}The convent    
 is now used by the Nuns as a rest home
 for their old Sisters. I sometimes    
 visit them because they are very nice 
 to speak to.                          
    West Ogwell is a very pretty little
 village.In West Ogwell there are no   
 shops,no telephones boxes or bus      
 stops.There are a few isolated        
 farms and houses.One is a dairy farm  
 and{Valley Farm,}where I live, is a   
 poultry and goat farm.In the old days 
 my home used to be the Parsonage.
