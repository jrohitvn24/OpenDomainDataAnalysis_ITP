		<title>18THE MILLS</title>
		<content>   Three of the old water mills were   
 situated in the survey area.          
 1) Le Moulin de Grands Vaux           
 Also known as Baxters Mill. This mill 
 was working up to 1962 when it was    
 knocked down to make way for a        
 reservoir.                            
 2) Le Moulin de Malassis.             
 This means the badly sited mill. It   
 was the only mill in Jersey not to    
 have its own mill pond. It was burnt  
 down in 1961 and the land on which it 
 stood was given as a play area. This  
 area is on the edge of Nicholson Park 
 Housing Estate and is often used by   
 children from the estate.             
 3) Paul Mill                          
  This was used up to the Second World 
 war and the main building is still    
 standing and is now being used as a   
 house.                                
                                       </content>
