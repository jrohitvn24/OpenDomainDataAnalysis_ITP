 The livelihood of the ferry was some  
 what quelled by the building of the   
 Bursledon toll bridge in 1798.The     
 original wooden bridge has now been   
 replaced ,(around 1933-35) and a newer
 motorway bridge was built for the M27 
 further up the river.                 
   Just after the first world war the  
 price of the ferry went up from 1d a  
 trip to 3d a trip.Now the ferryman    
 ,Ray Sedgewick charges 20p for adults 
 ,10p for children under twelve and 5p 
 for cycles.The ferry runs from 6.30am 
 to 7pm on weekdays,8.00 to 5.30pm on  
 saturdays,and 9.00am to 5.00pm on     
 Sundays, every day apart from         
 Christmas day and Boxing day.         
                                       
 At high tide the width of the crossing
 is a quarter of a mile and only an    
 eighth of a mile at low water.        </content>
