		<content>    We asked all  the children in the  
 school where their Mums and Dads      
 worked.Most of them worked in         
 Beverley and Hull,but there are       
 quite a lot who work in neighbouring  
 villages like Catwick,Bransburton,    
 Seaton, Long Riston,Skidby and        
 Beeford.                              
    We were surprised by the number of 
 people who actually stay in the       
 village all day.                      
    Some Dads work at sea as sailors   
 or marine engineers, this shows       
 our connection with Hull and the      
 docks.                                
    The 1981 census told us that       
 86% of the working population of the  
 village travel to work by car.        
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
