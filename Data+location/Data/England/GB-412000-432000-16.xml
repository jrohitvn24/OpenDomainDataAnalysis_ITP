		<title>16Bradford's First Asian Mayor</title>
		<content>    Bradford's new Lord Mayor has had  
 a rather unusual origin compared with 
 his predecessors. Bradford's new Lord 
 Mayor is{Councillor Mohammed Ajeeb,}  
 the son of a humble village farmer of 
{Pakistan.}Ajeeb is the first Asian to 
 receive this post and sees this as an 
 achievement that is worthy of honour  
 for both the{Asian}and black          
 communities of Bradford.              
    His roots are from a small village 
 in the district of Mirpur in Azad     
 Kashmir. At the age of fifteen, he    
 left home to go to Karachi. Soon, he  
 graduated with a B.A. degree from its 
 University. He then came to Britain   
 and for fourteen years lived in       
 Nottingham working on the buses.      
    Shortly before his term of office  
 began, I asked him how he felt about a
 recent survey which said that Bradford
 is one of the worst cities in Britain?</content>
