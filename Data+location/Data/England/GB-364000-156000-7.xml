		<title>07New Barn Farm,Paulton.</title>
		<content>{ New Barn Farm}covers 45 acres.Grass  
 is  grown as feed for 45 beef cattle  
 and heifers.The farmer kept dairy     
 cattle until recently,when the over-  
 production of milk in the E.E.C. led  
 him to switch to beef production. The 
 cattle are sold at markets at Winford 
 or Chippenham.                        
  Work starts on the farm at 7.00 a.m. 
 and finishes at 6.00 p.m.The farmer   
 has been working on the farm all his  
 life.He enjoys his work,even the muck_
 spreading.The only thing he does not  
 enjoy much is walking about in the    
 rain.He often has to mend hedges and  
 fences to stop the cows getting loose.
 He and his wife do all the work.They  
 employ no_one else and have no        
 holidays.                             
  The farmer owns a tractor and hay_   
 making machinery.
