		<content>{Park Farm}is on the outskirts of      
{Barnacle.}It is built of{brick}and    
{tile}on a stone base.This stone plinth
 was the foundation of an earlier      
 farmhouse, reputed to have been burnt 
 down during the{Civil war}.The remains
 of a moat also suggest an interesting 
 historical past.The farm currently    
 comprises 138 acres of{grassland},25  
 acres of{winter wheat}and 5 acres of  
{turnips}.40% of the grassland is used 
 for{grazing},the remainder is mown for
{silage}.The farm is typical of local  
 farms in that it specialises in one   
 main aspect of agriculture,-in this   
 case dairy farming.There are 110 milk 
 cows on the farm,and 20 heifers in    
 calf,but no beef cattle.Neighbouring  
 farms also concentrate on one form of 
 livestock or type of crop,dependent on
 the size of farm,soil mtype,etc.
