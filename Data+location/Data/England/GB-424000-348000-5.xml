		<content>  A lot of people have their own{cars  
 in this village. Half the families    
 never use the{bus services.}This      
 is because the{buses}do not run       
 every day and so people need{cars}to  
 get to work. Two{cars}are needed in a 
 lot of families because both the      
 adults go to work. Most families have 
 at least one{car.                     
  There are weekly bus services to     
{Ashbourne, Derby}and{Matlock}and twice
 a week to{Wirksworth.}The{buses}are   
 mainly used by older people to go     
 shopping but some of the{buses}go from
 Moor Lane along Blackwall Lane and do 
 not come into the village. This makes 
 it difficult for some older people    
 from the bottom end of the village to 
 use the{buses.                        
  The service to{Derby}is used most    
 often, followed by{Wirksworth,}with{  
{Matlock}and{Ashbourne}used equally.   </content>
