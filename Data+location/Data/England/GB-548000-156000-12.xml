		<title>12EATING OUT-DUNTON GREEN AREA</title>
		<content> In our block we have 2 hotels, 8 pubs 
 &amp; 3 take-aways. Donnington Manor, a   
 mock Tudor building was built just    
 after the Second World War &amp; is now   
 joined onto the Emma Hotel. The       
 creator of Donnington Manor was Bill  
 Newman, a local man &amp; an expert in    
 building mock Tudor, using genuine    
 materials from all over the country.  
 You can get a meal at most of the     
 public houses. At the Tatts Club you  
 can get bed &amp; breakfast. At some      
 places you can eat outside. The 3     
 take-aways are the Taj Tandoori,which 
 is an Indian restaurant as well as a  
 take-away, the Sun-On, a Chinese take-
 away, and Hei's chip-shop which is a  
 fish &amp; chip shop as well as a Chinese 
 take-away.
