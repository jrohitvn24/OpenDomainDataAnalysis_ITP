		<title>14Wellworthy Ltd. 1</title>
		<content>{ Wellworthy}was registered as an      
 official trade name in 1919 when John 
 Howlett began to expand his piston    
 manufacturing company formally known  
 as South Coast Garages. Wellworthy =  
 "Well" from "Priestlands{Well}" site +
 "worthy"=old Wessex name for a ring   
 around a well. At this time the area  
 was almost completely rural with yacht
 building the only industry. The site  
 on Lyndhurst Road, originally Ampress 
 Farm, was bought by Wellworthy in     
 1939. It is{35 acres}in size including
 large sports grounds.                 
  The main products are{pistons}and    
{piston rings}which are made at most of
 the 5 factories all situated in the   
 South and West of England. Since the  
 closure of the Stanford Rd. site in   
 Lymington the Ampress site has become 
 the head office. There are 2,500      
 employees at this plant.              </content>
