		<title>18Shops in Marchwood</title>
		<content>{Marchwood does not have many shops}   
 although its population has almost    
 doubled to 4000 in the past 15        
 years.However thare are two general   
 stores, a post office,a butcher, a    
 hardware store, an off-license and a  
 ladies' hairdresser.The general store 
 sells everything from groceries to    
 stationery.                           
    Because of the lack of shops many  
 people go to Totton or Southampton to 
 do their shopping.At the moment a new 
 larger shopping centre is being built 
 near the new school.There will be a   
 supermarket and six other new shops   
 with car parking facilities for about 
 120 cars.At the moment there is no    
 proper car park in the village.       
      With so many new houses being    
 built in Marchwood, even more shops   
 will be needed soon.
