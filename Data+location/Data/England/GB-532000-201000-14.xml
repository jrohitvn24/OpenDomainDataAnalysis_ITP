		<title>14Brookfield Farm hypermarket</title>
		<content> Brookfield farm is a large hypermarket
 with a petrol station, a free car park
 for 630 cars, a coffee shop and a     
 small parade of other shops. Tescos is
 built with red bricks and tiles. It   
 looks like a village and is surrounded
 by trees and grass with beds of       
 shrubs.                               
  It is outside the town centre,       
 alongside the A10 road.               
 It has a sales area of 39,600 square  
 feet. It employs 400 people and their 
 are 33 checkouts.                     
  It sells food, clothes and shoes,    
 gardening equipment, DIY equipment,   
 toys and books, housewares and plants.
  The people who use it come from a    
 large area. Some people we asked came 
 from 10 miles away. Most people get   
 there by car or the free bus service. 
  Most people liked it but some just   
 used it for convenience.              </content>
