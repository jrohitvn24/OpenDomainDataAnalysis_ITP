		<title>12A Child's View,Bromley,S.E.</title>
		<content> Green Street Green has some pleasant  
shops,and there are not too many to    
spoil the character of the village.I   
don't think there is really much       
entertainment here.To get to the       
nearest cinema we have to go to        
Bromley,but I think putting one here   
would spoil the character of the       
village.We have Brownies,which I went  
to when I a bit younger,and there are  
also Cubs and Guides.The Brownies is   
good for younger girls.I think Green   
Street Green is a friendly place to    
live in.The public transport is good,  
because there are frequent buses to    
Orpington and Bromley.There is a       
station in Chelsfield which is about   
10 minutes'walk away from Green Street 
Green,and there are trains to London.
