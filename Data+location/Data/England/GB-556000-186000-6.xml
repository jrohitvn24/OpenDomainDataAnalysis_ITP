		<title>06HISTORY OF CRANHAM</title>
		<content> Cranham was originally a{Saxon        
 village.In the 1086{Domesday Book}we  
 are told that Aelfric held the mannor 
 before 1066 and then Hugh took over.  
 There were 8 villagers,15 smallholders
 4 slaves.The value of Cranham was Â£6. 
 The most famous man to live here was  
{James Oglethorpe}founder of the state 
 of Georgia,who lived at{Cranham Hall  
 in the 18th Century.                  
 Until the coming of the railway in the
 1870s Upminster was a very small      
 village.Since then its growth has been
 rapid into a very large commuter town 
 embracing the village of Cranham.     
 The places of historic interest in the
 area are the{windmill}which was built 
 in 1802 and the{tithe barn}which was  
 built in 1450.
