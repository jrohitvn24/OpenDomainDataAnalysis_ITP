		<content>{... "Most people were dressed nicely  
{and they arrived on trains which were 
{crowded,other people were very scruffy
{and were having barbecues or picnics."
                                       
 ... "Some people came in groups and   
 were drinking things like beer,wine   
 and scotch."                          
                                       
{... "Some of the people were drunk,   
{like one man I saw who had a chef's   
{hat on and a monkey wrapped around his
{head,with a glass of champagne in his 
{hand."                                
                                       
 ... "Crowds of people pushing and     
 shoving looking like tiny ants,the    
 fair in full swing,people screaming,  
 book-makers shouting their odds,      
 children with toffee apples and candy 
 floss."
