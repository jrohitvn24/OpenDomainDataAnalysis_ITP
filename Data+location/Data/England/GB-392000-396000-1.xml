		<content> Block 03920396 is situated in         
 Tameside,which is one of the Local    
 Authorities of Greater Manchester, and
 includes sections of Ashton,Audenshaw,
 Dukinfield,Guide Bridge and Newton.   
 The residents (including several      
 immigrant communities) live in an area
 which has Victorian public buildings, 
 inner-city housing and typical        
 suburban areas,as well as modern      
 facilities for shopping,housing and   
 recreation.                           
 Some manufacturing industry is located
 in factories previously built for the 
 textile trade,but recent developments 
 include modern industrial estates.    
 Evidence of industrial decline can be 
 seen alongside the railway lines and  
 canals which pass through the block.  
 Plans for a Canal Museum/Heritage     
 Centre in Ashton reflect the desire   
 for leisure/recreational facilities.  </content>
