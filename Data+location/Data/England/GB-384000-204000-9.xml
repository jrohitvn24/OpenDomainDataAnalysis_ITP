   Just over a mile from Stroud,       
 Rodborough Fort is situated {600 ft}  
 above sea level.The fort is built on  
 an important site, with extensive     
 views over the valleys, and is thought
 to have once been a lookout post.     
   The present building is an example  
 of an 18th century folly, built in{   
{1761}by Mr.George Hawker on an area of
 land granted by the Lord of the       
 Manor.                                
   As the name suggests,the building   
 has the appearance of a fort or       
 castle, with castleated walls and a   
 keep.                                 
   Rodborough Fort is now used as a    
 Caravan and Camping Centre surrounded 
 by common land owned by the National  
 Trust since{1937.}
