		<content>    Mr Blakeney has been the huntsman  
 at the E.K.H. for 10 years.The        
 E.K.H. has been in Elham for 200      
 years.Hounds are trained by putting a 
 collar round an older hound's neck.   
 The old hound teaches the young hound.
 The hounds are fed four times a day.  
 Raw flesh is collected from the farms.
    Huntng takes place 2 times a week  
 on Wednesday &amp; Saturday during the    
 season. Hounds kill foxes by breaking 
 their necks.The E.K.H. covers the land
 from New Romney,Ashford,Canterbury    
 and Dover.The hounds are always       
 counted in pairs-couples. They are    
 walked as puppies by local people and 
 then before they are a year old they  
 go back to join the main pack and     
 learn how to hunt. They usually hunt  
 till they are 8 years old. Mr Blakeney
 blows his horn to tell the hounds and 
 hunters what to do.                   </content>
