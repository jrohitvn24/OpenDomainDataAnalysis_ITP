		<content>  13th &amp; 14th Century                  
                                       
 Alterations started and the present   
{nave and chancel}were added. The early
 English{lancet windows}at the East end
 of the lady chapel were put in at this
 time. The{font}is of the 13th Century 
 and is made of{Purbec marble}with two 
 shallow circles on each face and it   
 rests on several pillars.             
                                       
  15th Century                         
                                       
 All the windows were replaced at a    
 time in what is known as the          
{Perpendicular style.}The south porch  
 is probably of this period with a     
 brick frame around the edge. Some of  
 the{buttresses}were added at this     
 time.
