		<content>ON 27th JUNE,1985 WE INTERVIEWED       
THE GRANDFATHER OF A CHILD IN OUR      
CLASS.HE LIVES AND WORKS AT HEADLANDS  
FARM. THIS FARM IS USED FOR REARING    
SHEEP AND CATTLE. THE CATTLE ARE KEPT  
FOR BEEF AND THE SHEEP FOR WOOL.       
SPRING LAMBS ARE KEPT FOR MEAT TOO.HE  
STARTED FARMING AT THE AGE OF 16.HE    
ENJOYS WALKING ROUND LOOKING AT THE    
CATTLE. HE WORKS FROM 6.00a.m.UNTIL    
10.30p.m. YEARS AGO THERE WERE EIGHT   
WORKERS BUT NOW THERE IS ONLY          
HIMSELF.THERE ARE 104 ACRES OF LAND    
AROUND THE FARM. THE PROBLEMS ON THE   
FARM ARE FENCING BECAUSE PEOPLE KEEP   
BREAKING THEM. THE REAL OWNER OF       
HEADLANDS FARM LIVES IN WELLINGBOROUGH 
AND ALSO OWNS A SCRAPYARD. THE BIG     
CHANGES IN FARMING CAME IN ABOUT 1948  
WHEN LARGE MACHINES STARTED TO BE      
USED AS WELL AS FERTILISERS AND        
CHEMICAL SPRAYS.                       </content>
