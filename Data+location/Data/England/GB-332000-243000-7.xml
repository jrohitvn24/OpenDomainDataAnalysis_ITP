		<content> Almost all residents express great    
 satisfaction with life in the area.   
 The tranquillity, scenic beauty,      
 wild-life and fresh air rate highly   
 with those who live here by choice.   
 Those who were born here, when asked  
 how they find life here, confess they 
 never think about it, but certainly   
 like things as they are. They work    
 hard and enjoy their work, finding it 
 difficult to understand the political,
 industrial, and social problems which 
 beset city dwellers.                  
  On a material level, the difficulties
 of living in an isolated area are     
 mitigated by a mobile shop,           
 hairdresser, and Library. While many  
 people use solid fuel or bottled gas  
 for cooking, such items as fridges and
 freezers are regarded as essentials,  
 not merely luxuries.
