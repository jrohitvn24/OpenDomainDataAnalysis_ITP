		<title>12WALPOLE PARK</title>
		<content>    Gosport Borough Council want to    
 develop the Town Centre. This could   
 mean that part of{Walpole Park}is     
 built on. Over 80% of the children in 
 Newtown School use the park and we are
 worried, so are many of our parents   
 and friends. We asked Mrs Heather     
 Sinclair what she felt about the      
 Council's proposed developments.      
 Question _{Why do you go to the park? 
 'I go to enjoy an outing with my      
 children or as a welcome interlude    
 between shopping and travelling home. 
 I can rest by the Boating Lake whilst 
 Ben and Jemima play on the swings and 
 slides. We can go rowing or fish for  
 sticklebacks in the pond. It is an    
 ideal place for flying kites and there
 is plenty of room to play ball games  
 without any worry.
