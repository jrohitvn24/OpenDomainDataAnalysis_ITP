 There are lots of games Kingmoor      
 children play.{Kingy}is a popualar    
 one.You need lots of people and one   
 person has a ball and runs after the  
 other people and tries to hit them    
 with it.If anyone is hit that person  
 becomes man and then has to try and   
 hit the rest of the people with the   
 ball. The idea is to pass the ball    
 round quickly so that the players     
 are caught off their guard and are    
 hit with ball.                        
{Bug-Off}is a good game to play. You   
 need three or more people. One person 
 stands at a post and counts to fifty  
 while the others hide.When that person
 has finished counting he goes and     
 looks for the other people.
