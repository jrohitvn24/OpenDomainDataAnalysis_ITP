		<content>{ THE WORK OF FELTWELL PARISH COUNCIL} 
   The Council employ someone to cut   
 the grass on the village green and in 
 St. Nicholas' Church cemetery. In the 
 last two years the Council put three  
 new aluminium bus shelters in the     
 village. Feltwell and Methwold Parish 
 councils get together and organise a  
 coach to take children to the Thetford
 Sports centre in the summer holidays. 
   Sometimes a larger project is put   
 before the council. For example in    
 1983 the Council held a public meeting
 to set up the Feltwell Youth and      
 Community Centre Management Committee.
 They then worked very hard to raise   
 money to build an extension to the    
 Youth Centre. After obtaining grants  
 from West Norfolk Borough Council and 
 Norfolk County Council finally        
 sufficient money was raised and the   
 extension was built.                  </content>
