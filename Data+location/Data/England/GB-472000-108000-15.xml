		<title>15ROWLANDS CASTLE ASSN. 2</title>
		<content>    There has been a suggestion that   
 the name of the village be changed to 
 Rowlands Green and the villagers      
 intend to publish a history of the    
 village and "Rolokescastel" which lies
 in the grounds of "Deerleap" to       
 justify the retention of the name.    
    Another matter being discussed by  
 the association and the parish council
 is the state of 2 or 3 dilapitated    
 cottages which are spoiling the look  
 of the village green.                 
    The village has retained its       
 village school, pubs and stores and   
 consider themselves self-sufficient.  
{   Rowlands castle surgery friends:-} 
 This was formed in June 1984 with just
 5 villagers, who held fundraising     
 events to raise money for equipment in
 the village surgery. They were hoping 
 to purchase an E.C.G. machine early in
 1985.                                 </content>
