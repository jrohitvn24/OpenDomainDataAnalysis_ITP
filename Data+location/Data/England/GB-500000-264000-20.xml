		<title>20Village Life in Melchbourne</title>
		<content> Inhabitants of Melchbourne have very  
 different occupations; a brail        
 printer, a solicitor, a computer      
 consultant, a kitchen designer,a      
 headmistress and farm workers to name 
 but a few.                            
 Apart from work there are many village
 activities, organising and attending  
 discos, barbecues and seasonal        
 activities.                           
 Raising money for the Church is a     
 major priority. Many villagers give Â£1
 a week towards the Â£70,000 that is    
 required.                             
 At weekends gardens take priority,    
 with the sound of hedge trimmers and  
 lawnmowers being heard throughout.    
 The surrounding farms are all tenanted
 by one farmer from an Insurance       
 Company. The land has all been managed
 very sensitively and sheep still graze
 in Home Park under ancient oak trees. </content>
