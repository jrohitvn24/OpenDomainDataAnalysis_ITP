		<title>17THE   BOMBHOLE</title>
		<content> The bombhole is about 40 years old.It 
 is about 20metres by 45metres.If you  
 sieve through the earth and are lucky,
 one can sometimes find bits of a      
 Spitfire that  was shot down while    
 it was defending Britain in the Second
 World War.I have seen a bit of the    
 wing of the plane. It crashed after   
 being involved in a dog_fight with a  
 German bomber. For some strange reason
 people are always setting the hole on 
 fire. Because of its name people think
 that it will blow up if they set fire 
 to it. They normally get chased away  
 by the farmer who owns the land. He   
 does not like people in his fields.
