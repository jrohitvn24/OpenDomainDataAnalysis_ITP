		<content>   The percentage of people that have a
{colour T.V}is 87%, and the percentage 
 that don't is 13%.                    
   I have also found the percentage of 
{video}ownership. Only 19% had videos  
 and 81% didn't.                       
   My family enjoy watching T.V        
 especially me. I like watching        
{American}stories like Miami Vice,     
 Dallas, Dynasty and Knots Landing. I  
 like "Carry On "films and some British
 programmes.I think it is good to have 
 childrens programmes because the soap 
 operas are on too late.I do not like  
 violent things like murders.          
   My dad likes me watching T.V because
 somethings are interesting.I think T.V
 is great,it stops you from being      
 bored. If you want to know what is on 
 T.V you can look in the{newspaper.    
   There are 4{channels}BBC1 BBC2      
 Central and Channel 4.                </content>
