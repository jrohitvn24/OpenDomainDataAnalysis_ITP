		<title>08EMPLOYMENT IN EDGEFIELD</title>
		<content> Agriculture is no longer a major      
 source of employment in Edgefield: a  
 large farm such as Edgefield Hall only
 employs the farmer's own son. Most of 
 the farms seem to be mainly family    
 concerns, as are the different forms  
 of self-employment, such as the       
 Edgefield Pottery - a man and wife    
 team, and the Edgefield Gallery - run 
 by the artist, with extra help during 
 the tourist season. There is a breeder
 of miniature greyhounds, an owner of  
 boarding kennels who is also a dog-   
 breeder, a wood worker who makes doors
 and windows, a printer, a garage-owner
 a shopkeeper who also runs the Post   
 Office, a publican, and a welder. In  
 the summer tourism plays its part:    
 there are caravan sites and a few     
 holiday cottages. But there are few   
 jobs for the young who must go outside
 the village and have no transport.    </content>
