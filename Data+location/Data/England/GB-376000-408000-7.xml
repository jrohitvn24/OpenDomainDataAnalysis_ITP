		<title>07Farming-Bolton Road area</title>
		<content> The farming of the area is basically  
 livestock dependant on grass,which    
 grows well.Hay and silage are cut for 
 the main winter feed for the dairy    
 cattle and the young beef cattle.     
 The size of farm varies.Old Hall Farm 
 has forty dairy cows on 90 acres.     
 The three Spen Moor Farms have        
 amalgamated to form a unit of 144     
 acres. The farms are mostly for dairy 
 cattle. There is a unit at Pilkington 
 Fold Farm which raises beef cattle on 
 an intensive basis.A livery post has  
 been developed to cater for the local 
 horse riders.                         
 Many people think that this part of   
 Lancashire is totaly urban,but much of
 the land is in fact given over to     
 farming.
