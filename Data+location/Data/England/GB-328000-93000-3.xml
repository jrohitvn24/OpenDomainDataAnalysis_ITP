		<title>03    Great Trill</title>
		<content> Great Trill used to be a manor but it 
 is now a farm. It used to belong to   
 the Drakes, who had a coat of arms at 
 the side of the house carved in stone.
    The manor had lots of blocked doors
 and windows. There were lots of small 
 barn doors and windows.               
    Round the door were arches. There  
 was a door with steps leading to it.  
 The steps were crumbled but you could 
 still see them. John Drake moved into 
 Great Trill because Ashe House, his   
 family house, was burnt down in the   
 civil war.                            
    John Drake was born on the 31st of 
 May in 1660 at Trill.                 
     The First Duke of Marlborough was 
 born at Trill. A few fields away there
 was a battle. So many men were killed 
 all the blood went into the stream.   
 The stream is called Budley Lake. The 
 battle took place at War Lake.        </content>
