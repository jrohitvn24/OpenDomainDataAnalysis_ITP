		<title>05WARBLINGTON SCHOOL BUILDING</title>
		<content>  Warblington School's main building is
 the{only one of it's kind}in Britain. 
 Built as an experiment in the early   
 50s by Bristol Aircraft Co. it is made
 of Alclad. A similar one in Coventry  
 has been destroyed by acid rain.      
 There are three other blocks ,a sports
 hall and a swimming pool (out of      
 doors).                               
 The whole school is laid out on the   
 east end of a large sports field,     
 facing Southleigh Road.To the north   
 there is the Portsmouth-London railway
 line.                                 
 The main block is three stories high  
 and except for a gas tank to the north
 and some flats to the north-west,it is
 the tallest building in the area.In a 
 Havant Conservation Report of 1974 the
 thirty-three year old dull grey       
  building was said to be an eyesore,  
 and more should be done to screen it. </content>
