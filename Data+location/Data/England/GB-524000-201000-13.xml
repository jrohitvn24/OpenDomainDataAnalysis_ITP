		<title>13The Reverend John Schild</title>
		<content>   John, who is vicar of Christ Church,
 Little Heath, is married to Elizabeth,
 and has two children - Andrew aged    
 eighten years (twin sister Debra died 
 in 1982) and Rebecca aged fifteen     
 years. They have been in the locality 
 for eight years and John enjoys his   
 work very much.                       
   He was born in Sheffield, although  
 his parents were Cockneys. John then  
 went on to University and was a       
 designer of scientific instruments    
 before entering the Ministry. He did  
 this so that he might work with       
 "people rather than things."  John    
 especially enjoys encouraging people  
 to worship in a relaxed and happy way 
 and visiting Little Heath School - and
 playing with computers !
