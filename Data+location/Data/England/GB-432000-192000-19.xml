		<content>     A DAY IN THE LIFE OF A FARMER     
The farmer works long hours and never  
has a day off. He gets up at 6.45am, he
has breakfast at any time, lunch at    
12.30pm and has tea some time between  
5.00 and 10.30pm. In winter, before    
breakfast, he feeds and cleans out the 
young cattle. During the morning he    
spreads muck from all cattle on the    
fields and after lunch he loads silage 
for next day. In summer before         
breafast he feeds the young cattle     
with hay. He spends the rest of the    
day putting fertilizer on all the      
fields, rolling and chain-harrowing the
fields or rotivating the fields to     
reseed grass and plant grass seed.
