		<content> Sixth formers, sixteen to eighteen    
 year olds are allowed to specialise in
 certain subjects, at an advanced      
 level. The maximum of four subjects   
 are studied over a period of two      
 years, with the aim of eventually     
 achieving entry into further education
 There is more free time in the sixth  
 form for private study or meeting     
 friends in a separate sixth form area.
 There is a lot of homework to do which
 restricts the social life of the young
 people who likes to go out and enjoy  
 themselves at that age. Lack of money 
 is also a problem.                    
 Some pupils decide to leave school at 
 sixteen and go to West Bromwich       
 College of Commerce and Technology.   
 Here students are offered  a wide     
 range of courses, for example,        
 engineering, catering and office      
 studies.                              </content>
