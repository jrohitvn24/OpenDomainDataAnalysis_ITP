		<title>05 Seal Village</title>
		<content>Seal is a village situated just outside
Sevenoaks. When we visited Seal we     
found that the population of the       
village was approximately 2500. The    
oldest building is the church ,later we
found that there was also a monastry   
which is now used as a block of shops. 
The monastry buildings are as old as   
the church. There are three Public     
Houses. One is called The Kentish      
Yeoman and used to be a carriage stop. 
It was built in 1200 AD. There are also
three garages. One used to be a forge  
where the old horse drawn Fire Engine  
was kept. Under Seal village there are 
lots of tunnels. We found a tunnel     
going under the parish church which    
came out on the other side of the      
church.
