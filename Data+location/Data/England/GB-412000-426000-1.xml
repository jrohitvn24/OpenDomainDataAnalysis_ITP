		<title>01WYKE GENERAL</title>
		<content> Our area is a mixture of town and     
 country, ranging from the townships of
 Wyke and Low Moor in the east, to     
 small scattered farms and villages    
 such as Norwood Green and Coley.      
 Wyke was mentioned in the original    
 Domesday Book as part of Bierley, and 
 comprised a few isolated farms.       
 Although the ownership of the land    
 changed many times, the whole area    
 remained undeveloped until the        
 Industrial Revolution when the Low    
 Moor Iron Company, and others,        
 exploited the iron and coal which was 
 readily available.  Remains of old    
 tramways and bell pits can still be   
 found in Judy Woods and, together with
 the dilapidated iron and steel works  
 at Low Moor, these are all that       
 remains of a once important iron trade
 which supplied cannons for the        
 Napoleonic Wars.                      </content>
