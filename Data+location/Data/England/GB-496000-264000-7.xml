		<title>07 Rectory Farm (Mixed Farm)</title>
		<content>  Rectory Farm is part of the land     
owned by the Duchy of Lancaster - the  
Queen. The tenants rent the farm from  
the Duchy paying for the 230 acres it  
covers. The Duchy undertakes any       
repairs and improvements and the rent  
is adjusted accordingly; recently new  
land drainage was installed which      
increased the rent.                    
  The farm is mixed comprising about   
100 sheep, 2 horses and crops of oil-  
seed rape, wheat and hay. To conserve  
grazing land sheep remain inside during
the winter and are given fodder crops. 
  The farm has 4 tractors, 1 baler, a  
combine harvester, hay tedder, plough  
and muck spreader.                     
  In May 1985 the Queen visited the    
area to inspect some of the Duchy      
farms.All her tenants were invited to  
a special luncheon with her.
