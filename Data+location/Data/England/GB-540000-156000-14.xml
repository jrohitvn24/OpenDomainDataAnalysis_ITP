In 1951 the Rev. Vivian Symons M.A.    
became the curate of Biggin Hill. The  
Church of St. Mark was then a          
corrugated iron structure,             
affectionately known as "The Tin       
Tabernacle". As this was not regarded  
by the Church authorities as a         
permanent building it had never been   
consecrated, so the area was a Â£Peal   
District' not a parish. The incumbent  
could only be licensed as a Â£Perpetual 
Curate' not inducted as a vicar. The   
community was growing rapidly and      
there was a need for a permanent       
church.                                
In London were bomb damaged churches   
everywhere. Mr.Symons carried all the  
materials back to his site. It took him
three and a half years to achieve his  
aim and the Church is still standing.
