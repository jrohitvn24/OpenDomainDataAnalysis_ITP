		<title>03Aston Cantlow Church</title>
		<content>    In Aston Cantlow there is the      
 parish church of St John the          
 Baptist.There was a priest in Aston   
 Cantlow in 1086 so the church is of   
 Norman or Anglo Saxon origin. Notice  
 the tower and the North West Turret.  
 There are two square headed windows to
 the left of the North doorway, maybe  
 14th cent..A window at the east end of
 the north aisle is ancient.It may have
 been removed from the medieval chapel 
 at Wilmcote.The priest's door and the 
 great east window of the chancel plus 
 the three southern chancel windows are
 13th cent..The south wall and porch   
 from the chancel to tower was taken   
 down and reconstructed in 1850.The    
 font is 15th cent., the bowl is       
 octagonal with floral decoration.The  
 tower has six bells.One is 15th cent..
 Four are 17th cent.;the sixth was     
 added in 1924.                        </content>
