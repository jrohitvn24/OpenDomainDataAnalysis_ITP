		<content>      *** THE OLD VICARAGE ***         
  My house was built in 1685 and       
re-built in 1852.It used to be {the    
vicarage}.                             
  On the walls of the stables are the  
names of some of the people who lived  
in or visited the house.Here are some  
of them:1879-H.Robinson                
        1918-N.Abbot                   
        1928-K.Spencer                 
        1940-K.Winnie                  
        1962-W.Sutton                  
        1972-M.Rogers                  
  It has nine bedrooms and a bathroom. 
Downstairs there are eight rooms,a     
cellar and a coal room.There is        
a little shed opposite the railway and 
there are two large fields.There are   
also stables where we keep two horses.
