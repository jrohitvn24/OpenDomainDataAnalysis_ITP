		<content>{Pensilva School}was opened in{1913    
 with 154 pupils. These numbers fell   
 over the years until the 1960's when  
 there were about 80 pupils. As the    
 village grew so the school grew to    
 over 200 pupils.By 1985 this had      
 levelled off at about 190. The school 
 had changed a lot-new kitchens and    
 toilets had been built and there were 
 5 temporary classrooms in the grounds.
{A new school is now being planned.    
 There are events such as Sports Day,  
 Swimming Gala,Open Evening and        
 Christmas parties and concerts. The   
{Parent Staff Association}run a Summer 
 Fete, bazaars and sales to raise money
 for the school.The money has been used
 for televisions, musical equipment and
 books but mostly for{the swimming pool
 which{has a roof and solar heating.
