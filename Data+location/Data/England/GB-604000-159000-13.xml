		<title>13A FAVOURITE DAY</title>
		<content> The day of the week I look forward to 
 most is Wednesday.I get up earlier    
 than I normally do,and put my swimming
 trunks on.I make my way to school and 
 after register we travel to Faversham 
 swimming pool.                        
               In the pool we warm up  
 with six widths holding a float in    
 front,followed by four widths on our  
 backs with a float.People who can swim
 go up the twelve-feet end to do their 
 length.I don't like having to jump in 
 the deep end.                         
              We go back to work for   
 the rest of the day,but at lunchtime  
 we play games such as cricket,tennis  
 and football.                         
              In the evening I play    
 table-tennis during winter,and cricket
 club in the summer.The day is rounded 
 off with BBC's Mid-Week Sports        
 Special.                              </content>
