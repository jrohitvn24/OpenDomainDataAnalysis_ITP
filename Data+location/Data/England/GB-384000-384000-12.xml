		<content>   There are a number of parks in our  
 area including{Bruntwood,Ryecroft,    
{and Maple.}Ryecroft Park is a private 
 park.Maple Avenue Park has only three 
 apparatus,while Bruntwood Park has a  
 new BMX course and a lot of open      
 fields.In my opinion Maple Avenue is  
 in need of repair whereas Bruntwood   
 is amply equipped already.We did not  
 visit Ryecroft but we were able to see
 that it was quite prosperous,with a   
 meeting house and floodlights.        
   We are well served with churches in 
 our area.We were able to visit St.    
 Andrew's church.This church was built 
 in 1959 on the site of the old wooden 
 church.The church was built to the    
 cost of Â£25 000,not including         
 fittings.It is a busy church with     
 mother and toddler and youth groups.  
 There are also two choirs,the main    
 choir and the youth choir.            </content>
