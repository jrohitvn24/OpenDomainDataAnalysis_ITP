		<title>09THE VICAR'S DAY IN ANLABY</title>
		<content> After rising at 7.15 a.m. the vicar   
 begins work at 8.15. Today he spends  
 an hour delivering leaflets and       
 talking to parishioners he meets.     
 Between 9.15 and 1 p.m. he holds a    
 Bible study group at the vicarage,    
 prepares a sermon, takes morning      
 communion and deals with the mail.    
 After lunch,1-2p.m.,he joins the      
 members of the over-60's club. The    
 rest of the afternoon is spent        
 visiting parishioners and people who  
 have left but want to maintain        
 contact.Tea,at 6 p.m.,is followed by  
 choir practice. Visits are made in the
 evening to those needing comfort - a  
 sick child, a bereaved lady. At 8 p.m.
 is another Bible study and prayer     
 group. By 10 p.m. it's time to unwind 
 - the paper is read and letters are   
 written. At 10.30 the vicar retires to
 bed.                                  </content>
