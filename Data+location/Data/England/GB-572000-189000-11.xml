		<content> We are ten years old. We asked our    
 mates in school to find out what their
 mums and dads did after work.         
                                       
 Some of them go up the pubs for a     
 drink, or if where they work has got a
 club, they go up there when the       
 children can go too. Some of the dads 
 belong to football clubs, and some of 
 the mums belong to keep-fit clubs.    
 A couple of the dads have interesting 
 hobbies like making models of cars and
 things, or making and icing cakes.    
 The mums don't seem to have time for  
 hobbies. If the weather is fine some  
 might go for a walk down to Northlands
 Park. At the weekends if there isn't  
 shift work they might go for a drive  
 somewhere.                            
                                       
 But a lot are too tired to do anything
 except watch television or sleep.     </content>
