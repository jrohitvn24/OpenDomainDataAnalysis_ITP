		<content>   Some of the houses in our "D" block 
 have beams.The{thatch}was originally  
 tied to the beams with raw hide.Raw   
 hide is strong{material}.Some houses  
 have been restored but there are still
 some pieces of the original hide left.
   The walls of these old houses are   
 made of wattle and daub.This is made  
 up of lime and pieces of chopped      
 straw.The daub comes in slats.The     
 local building is chalk.Flint is often
 used to decorate the walls of houses. 
 Some houses just have chalk slabs on  
 the floor.In old houses the window    
 sills are quite low.                  
   Houses would only have one window in
 each room,the window would be on the  
 North side.                           
   Some houses have{pargetting},there  
 are two types of pargetting.There is  
 one where it is inscribed into the    
 wall and another when it is moulded.  </content>
