		<title>19The Games Children Play</title>
		<content> As in all playgrounds our children    
 play singing, dancing, clapping, ball 
 throwing and skipping games. The songs
 have been sung by generations of      
 Prestonians with slightly changed     
 words. Skipping games are played in   
 spring. Ball games, always popular,   
 have often kept the old words, e.g.   
 One two three Alera I saw my sister   
 Sara. Running games are popular e.g.  
 Stick in the Mud and Scarecrow Tig.   
 The boys favourite game is British    
 Bulldogs, though it is very rough. The
 new game Elastics is very popular now.
 A circle of elastic is held around the
 legs of two or three children, whilst 
 others jump over or astride it. The   
 heights of the elastic vary.          
 Rollerbooting, BMX riding and, for    
 indoors, the computer, are popular    
 occupations.
