		<title>17Social Events in Woodchurch</title>
		<content> There are many different events in    
 Woodchurch.  On the Green every year  
 there is a carnival.  The carnival is 
 a time of year when people get dressed
 up and go on floats and we all have   
 fun.  Once a year there is a Whizz    
 Bang and Bonfire Night, when we have  
 fireworks.  The Whizz Bang raises     
 money for the Windmill.  Nearly every 
 month there is a Church Parade.  There
 is also the Royal Btitish Legion.     
 Every week there is Sunday School,    
 where people learn about God.  On     
 Fridays, there is the Darby and Joan  
 club for old people.  There is also a 
 Library, Bingo and Mother and Toddlers
 club.  There is also Brownies, Guides,
 Cubs and Scouts.
