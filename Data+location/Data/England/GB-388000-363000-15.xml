		<title>15LEISURE IN BOSLEY</title>
		<content> The village offers few leisure        
 facilities for children or adults.    
 There is no recreation ground or local
 football pitch .The children are      
 taught swimming at school.Most go     
 swimming in their own time but have   
 to travel at least 5 miles to the     
 nearest bath in Macclesfield.Other    
 swimming baths used are Congleton,    
 Biddulph,Leek and Buxton.All children 
 watch television for at least an hour 
 and up to 4 hours in the winter.The   
 chapel runs a club for the 10 to 14   
 years but there are no other organised
 activities for young people.The       
 nearest Brownie group is at Sutton,and
 the nearest Scout group at Buglawton  
 both about 4 miles away.There is an   
 adult fishing club .The two pubs      
 organise darts matches and clay pigeon
 shoots.Aerobic classes are held in    
 school.                               </content>
