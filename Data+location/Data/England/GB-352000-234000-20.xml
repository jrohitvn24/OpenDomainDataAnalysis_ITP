		<title>20IMPRESSIONS OF TWO VILLAGES</title>
		<content>{Holme Lacy}is a{sleepy little village.
{Dinedor,}its nearest neighbour, is    
 even sleepier.  {Holme Lacy}only has  
 about{50 houses, Dinedor}about{20.    
 The people are{relaxed and friendly   
 and have{time to talk}to each other   
 and to strangers, and to wait.  Nobody
 was in a hurry, and even the people   
 doing something - building, or        
 gardening, or going to the{Post Office
 - seemed not to be busy.   Most of    
 them are{old and retired.  }The       
 villages are tucked away in a         
{beautiful corner of Herefordshire,}and
 seem remote even in a{remote area. }It
 feels as if{time is standing still,   
 especially in Dinedor,where even a dog
 in the road is interesting. The people
 seem to be{quite cut off}from the rest
 of the world, and as a result are very
 occupied with the affairs of their    
 village and their neighbours.         </content>
