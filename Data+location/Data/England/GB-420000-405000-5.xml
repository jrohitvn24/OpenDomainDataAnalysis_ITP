		<title>05Denby Village</title>
		<content> Denby lies on a spur of land which    
 lies between two steep sided valleys. 
 The village is split into two parts  {
{Upper and Lower Denby. }There are more
 houses in Upper Denby. The village now
 only has 3 shops: a butchers, a       
 hairdressers and a Post               
 Office/General store.These are all    
 situated in Upper Denby. Mobile       
 shops call together with a mobile     
 library and a mobile clinic once a    
 week. The land falls from 900 feet in 
 the west to 600 feet to the north and 
 south. Most of the land is pasture but
 there is some{woodland}to the north   
 and more in the south and south east. 
 The farms are mainly{dairy farms}with 
 a little arable farming.              
 The village is very bleak in winter   
 and exposed to the  winds that blow   
 from the Pennines bringing a lot of   
 snow.                                 </content>
