		<content>   There are few local amenities in    
 this area. There is only a single bus 
 service, three days a week, from the  
 village of Inkberrow to Evesham,      
 passing through Church Lench. Cars are
 essential so a good neighbour policy  
 helps non-drivers and the elderly.    
    The village shop, the only one     
 in the Lenches, acts as agent for     
 occasional day trips run by a private 
 bus company _ also for other services 
 i.e.dry cleaners.It is also the Post  
 Office.                               
    There is a mobile greengrocery van 
 run by a local grower,that serves the 
 area weekly.This man also hires out a 
 pony and trap that is very popular for
 weddings. A fish and chip van toursthe
 area one day a week.                  
    The mobile library van from Evesham
 visits fortnightly and the doctor     
 holds a surgery every Friday.         </content>
