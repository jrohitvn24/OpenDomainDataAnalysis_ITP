		<title>01An introduction to Dalston</title>
		<content> Dalston is in the north west part of  
 England situated some five miles south
 of the border city of{Carlisle.}      
 Dalston is just out of the northern   
 boundary of the{Lake District National
{Park.}The{R.Caldew}flows through the  
 village and eventually out into the   
{Solway Firth}.                        
 The area is mainly farmland despite   
 its close proximity to the city.Many  
 of the inhabitants of the village are 
 professional people who may commute to
 Carlisle or other large towns.The     
 population of Dalston in 1981 was     
 roughly 2,500.                        
 There is not alot of industry in      
 Dalston itself, it is mainly a        
 residential area. It is well served by
 public transport. There are many      
 amenities and societies in Dalston and
 the church is well supported.
