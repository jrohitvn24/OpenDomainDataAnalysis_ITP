		<content>Penkridge was originally a market      
village famous for its Horse Fairs,    
surrounded by farmland. Now it's easy  
access by rail, motorway and trunk road
makes it an ideal residence for        
commuters. The canal and river Penk    
also run through Penkridge.            
Hailing Dene, 4C's, the Library and the
Monkton Centre offer sports and        
recreatioal facilities. There are also 
7 pubs. Shops provide only the bare    
essentials for the population of 9000. 
There are 5 schools providing the      
complete spectrum of education from    
5 to 13 years. There are 2 churches,   
St Michael's and the Methodist Chapel, 
which offer opportunities for a wide   
range of discussion groups.            
The housing estates are now sprawling  
out into the farmland to the East near 
Pillaton Hall, the Squires home for    
Littletons &amp; Mathertons for many years.</content>
