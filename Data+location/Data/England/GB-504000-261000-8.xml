		<content>      Mr Futter works at Instrument    
 Engineering with four other people.His
 premises have been at 37, High        
 Street,opposite the Five Bells for 12 
 years now.He makes complete machines. 
 People ask him to make special        
 machines for a particular job then he 
 plans,builds it and tests it in the   
 customer's workshop.  His job is not  
 finished until he has the machine     
 working where it is to be used.       
      All his machines are to do with  
 welding,joining two pieces of metal   
 together.  Over the years he has made 
 many "one off" machines for customers 
 all over the country.  He sells mostly
 to industry.  He is working on a jet  
 project in 1985.  He has worked for   
 many large companies and now exports  
 to Europe and elsewhere.
