		<content>White's Close was opened in 1951 by    
Mrs John White as residences for old   
people. The houses were funded by John 
White's Boot and Shoe Manufacturing    
Firm which is opposite the Close.      
                                       
                                       
In the pleasant surroundings of the    
Close there are 3 brick buildings each 
containing 3 bungalows which are       
designed for 1 or 2 old people.        
                                       
                                       
In 1985 a problem has developed with   
vandalism. In this area the residents  
also feel very vunerable to attack.    
Despite this the bungalows are warm    
and cosy and the gardens colourful and 
well kept.
