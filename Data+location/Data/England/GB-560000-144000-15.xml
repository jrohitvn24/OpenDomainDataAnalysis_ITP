		<title>15HEDGEROWS CHURCH LANE CAPEL</title>
		<content> NEARLY ALL THE HEDGES IN CHURCH LANE  
 ARE OVER 500 YEARS OLD. IN A TREE     
 COUNT OVER 100 METRES WE FOUND SIX    
 DIFFERENT TREES - HAZEL, BLACKTHORN,  
 OAK, HAWTHORN, ASH AND ELDER. IN EACH 
 HEDGE THERE IS AN ABUNDANCE OF        
 INTERESTING FLOWERS,TREES AND CLIMBING
 PLANTS. I FOUND 23 COLOURFUL SPECIES  
 OF WILDFLOWERS, 10 CLIMBING PLANTS    
 AND 16 TREES, 9 OF WHICH ARE NATIVE   
 TREES AND 7 INTRODUCED SPECIES.       
{THERE HAS BEEN A RECENT INCREASE OF   
{WILD PLANTS IN THE LANE BECAUSE THE   
{ESCALATING COST OF INSECTICIDES AND   
{HERBICIDES HAS RESULTED IN A DECREASE 
{OF THEIR USE BY FARMERS. WILD LIFE HAS
{ALSO BENEFITTED FROM COUNCIL ECONOMIES
{IN VERGE CONTROL.}SOME WILD FLOWERS I 
 HAVE OBSERVED WERE POPPY, HOP TREFOIL,
 ROSEBAY WILLOW HERB,HAIRY WILLOW HERB,
 SELF HEAL, HOGWEED, CRANESBILL,MALLOW,
 COW PARSLEY AND MANY VETCHES.         </content>
