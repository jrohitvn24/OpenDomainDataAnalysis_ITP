		<title>13SUTTON BONINGTON SCOUTING</title>
		<content> In 1907{Lord Baden Powell}returned    
 from the{Boer War.}He  decided it was 
 necessary to start a{scouting}movement
 for the physical and spiritual        
 education of youth. It began          
 with the{Boy Scouts}and later was     
 joined by{Cubs, Rose Buds (Brownies)  
 and{Guides.                           
 There has been{scouting}in the village
 on and off from early times but the   
 recent{troops}have been in operation  
 for about thirty years. They have five
 groups, the{Venture Scouts, Scouts,   
{Guides, Cubs}and{Brownies.}The village
 is fortunate in having a{Scout HQ}at  
 the playing fields which was built and
 is maintained by supportive parents.
