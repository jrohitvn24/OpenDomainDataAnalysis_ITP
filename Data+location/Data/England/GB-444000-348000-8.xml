		<content> P.C.Lomax has been Brinsleys' local   
 policeman for ten years.His jobs      
 involve first aider,social worker,    
 local policeman,child minder and      
 thief catcher.The main police         
 station is in Eastwood.There are      
 three areas which operate from this   
 station :they are Brinsley, Eastwood  
 and Newthorpe and the contact point is
 at Kimberley. The beat P.C.Lomax      
 patrols starts at the bridge on       
 Mansfield Road and continues to       
 Moorgreen Colliery.From there it goes 
 down a narrow lane near to the        
 Ashfield boundary into Underwood and  
 then to the Brinsley Gin and then     
 back to Mansfield Road.He prefers his 
 beat more than the ones in the big    
 city because of the rural aspects.    
 Brinsley is full of good people who   
 respect the law.The crime rate is     
 comparatively low.                    </content>
