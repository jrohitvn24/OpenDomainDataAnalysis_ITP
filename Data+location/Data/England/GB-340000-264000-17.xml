		<title>17AYMESTREY AREA- HOUSING</title>
		<content>  Apart from one or two modern houses  
 and 6 council houses (2 at Yatton,4 at
 Lucton) most people live in converted 
 farm cottages or farm houses, making  
 comfortable modernised interiors but  
 still retaining old features (beamed  
 ceilings,huge open fireplaces etc).   
   All houses have mains electricity   
 but no mains gas or mains sewage (use 
 septic tanks) and nearly all are on   
 the phone.{The Welsh Water Authority  
 provides mains water to Aymestrey and 
 Lucton villages and to Yatton but all 
 other dwellings pump their own from   
 bore holes or springs.                
   Large gardens are a feature of most 
 houses and often an adjoining small   
 orchard growing cider apples.         
   Wood is used often as a fuel,in open
 fires ,wood burning stoves for cooking
 and central heating, and many have    
 electric oil or propane gas heating.  </content>
