		<title>11World of Work Survey</title>
		<content> We conducted a survey among a sample  
 of adults in the village to find out  
 something about where they work and   
 how they feel about their jobs.  48%  
 worked in Bristol or Bath, the two    
 major cities in the area. 32% worked  
 in the village. 68% used a car to get 
 to work with 8% using a bicycle and   
 16% walking. Nobody went to work on   
 the bus. Most set off for work after 8
 a.m. and returned before 6 p.m.  88%  
 enjoyed their work. 8% did not. Only  
 8% would like to live closer to their 
 work.
