		<title>12Bocking Hall</title>
		<content>       The centre of the house was     
 built in about 1500 for the monks from
{Canterbury}who administered an area   
 stretching from{E. Mersea}to{Hadleigh,
 in{Suffolk.}Records are in Kent. There
 have been additions and alterations to
 the house over the years.             
       There is evidence of an outside 
 staircase leading to what was probably
 the court room. The present day pond, 
 is thought to have provided carp for  
 the monks' table. In 1534 the house   
 and land was sold to the{Wentworth    
 family for Â£735! The present facade   
 and a second staircase were added in  
 the 18th century. There is a rumour of
 a tunnel from the Hall to the church  
 but there is no real evidence of this.
       Five years ago{Mr &amp; Mrs Pickford
 bought the Hall from the{Tabor}family 
 and they are carefully restoring this 
 beautiful and interesting home.       </content>
