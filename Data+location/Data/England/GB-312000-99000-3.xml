		<title>03A DAY IN MY LIFE by SIOBHAN</title>
		<content> I usually get up at 7.00 and am       
 dressed at half past seven. I go to   
 school at 8.30. When we get to school 
 we play for a little while. At 9.00 we
 start school. When we get in, we go   
 into Mrs. Wadsworths room for         
 assembly. Then we go into our         
 classroom and do some work. We write  
 stories and do number games. At 10.40 
 it is playtime. Playtime finishes at  
 10.55 and we usually do sums and at   
 12.00 we have our dinner. After dinner
 we have another playtime which        
 finishes at 1.15. In the afternoon we 
 paint, have poems, make things and    
 choose. We finish at 3.30 and go home 
 to tea. I play outdoors on my bike or 
 read a book. I like Enid Blyton       
 stories. At 7.00 I go to bed.
