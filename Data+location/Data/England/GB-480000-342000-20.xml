		<content>{Transport}plays an important part in  
 the lives of the people of the area.  
 The{A1}passes close to Long Bennington
 linking it with Newark and Grantham.  
 From the result of a questionaire 38% 
 of the local people shop in Newark,and
 41% in Grantham using private cars or 
 the local bus services. The majority  
 of people also travel to work in the  
 surrounding areas, and sometimes as   
 far as Nottingham, Essex and London.  
 The nearby areas are also convenient  
 bases for firms which operate all over
 the world, using the main road and    
 rail links to reach airports. All     
 kinds of transport are seen in the    
 area articulated lorries, farm        
 vehicles, bicycles, horses with riders
 or carriages and a{Sinclair C.5.      
 driven by Mrs Margetts.As in original 
 Domesday times, transport plays an    
 important part in this rural area.    </content>
