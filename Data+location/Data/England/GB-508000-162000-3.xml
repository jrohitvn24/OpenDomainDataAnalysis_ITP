		<content>{Whiteley Village}is built to an       
 octogan design, with roads crossing   
 it. There is a statue of {William     
{Whiteley}at the centre, and about 360 
 houses. Most of them are for single   
 people. They only have three real     
 rooms, and are very small but cosy and
 comfortable. the main room is a living
 room with the resident's own          
 furniture. It can be divided with a   
 curtain to make a bedroom, but most of
 the ones we were shown preferred to   
 keep this as one larger room which    
 included a bed settee.There is also a 
 very small kitchen, and a shower and  
 toilet. Most of the people we spoke to
 liked their cottages, because they    
 were small and easy to look after.    
 Nearly every old person who we visited
 had photographs of their children and 
 grand-children on display.
