      We conducted a survey in our area
 to find out how much T.V. and radio   
 people watched every day, and what    
 sort of programmes they liked best.   
  Films and serials were most popular, 
 chat shows were least popular.        
  In our area about half the people    
 watch T.V. for about 4-6 hours each   
 day.A quarter of the people watch more
 than 6 hours a day and the other      
 quarter watch for less than 4 hours.  
 One eighth of the families surveyed   
 have Oracle or Ceefax, and a 1/3 have 
 video-recorders.Of the people who have
 video- recorders, half hire two tapes 
 each week.                            
   About 1/4 of the people in our area 
 listen to the radio for 3-4 hours a   
 day, and another 1/4 to the radio for 
 just under an hour.Another 1/4 listen 
 for more than 4 hours.                </content>
