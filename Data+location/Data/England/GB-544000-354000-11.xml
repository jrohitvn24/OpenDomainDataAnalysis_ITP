		<title>11A FRISKNEY WEEKEND</title>
		<content> After school on Friday I watched T.V. 
 On Saturday morning I wore my best    
 clothes to go to my piano lesson. I   
 had my lunch and went with mum to the 
 village jumble sale.I got there and   
 walked around with Sarah Wright. My   
 sister Julia came on her bike later.At
 the end she had a trick cigarette     
 lighter and she squirted mum with it. 
 At night we all sat round the fire    
 and watched the T.V. Dad was on Juliet
 Bravo. On Sunday I had my birthday    
 present a day early as dad was going  
 to London on Monday. To my surprise it
 was a new bike. I was very pleased    
 with it. In the afternoon we went to  
 Gibralter Point. It was great as the  
 wind was strong and the waves were big
 and rough.I went to bed happy as it   
 was my birthday but sad as it was     
 school the next day.
