		<title>19Employment, Stallingborough</title>
		<content> Stallingborough is now basically a    
 dormitory village, with the majority  
 of workers employed in the Humber     
 Bank Industries. The British Rail     
 depot at Immingham employs a few train
 drivers and guards.There are a few    
 self-employed people: a plumber,      
 builder, joiner and market gardener.  
 Only ten men are employed on the two  
 farms. The few professional people are
 mainly teachers and nurses, with two  
 doctors. Unemployment is fairly high- 
 around 15%. In the past few years     
 local factories have cut their work   
 force by offering early retirement or 
 redundancy to employee over 55. Womens
 jobs tend to be in factory offices    
  and part-time in shops, supermarkets 
 and frozen-food factories. Very few   
 apprenticeships are available for     
 school leavers and some 16 year olds  
 join youth training schemes.          </content>
