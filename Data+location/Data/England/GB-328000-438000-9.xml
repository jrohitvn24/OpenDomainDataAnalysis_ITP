		<content>{WARBRECK WATER TOWER}                 
 This water tower was built in 1931 for
 the  Fylde Water Board; it is made of 
 reinforced concrete, faced with       
 precast concrete blocks and has a     
 reinforced concrete roof.The two      
 reservoirs form part of the Blackpool 
 area distribution system and there is 
 an electrically driven pump which     
 delivers the water to the tank from   
 the reservoir. The water tower stands 
 out from the houses all around; it is 
 7.31 metres deep and 37.5 metres above
 ground level. The function of the     
 water tower is to supply and maintain 
 a high pressure of water to           
 Blackpool's dense town centre and high
 rise areas.                           
 The tank is 7.62 metres high and can  
 hold 114000 cubic metres of water.
