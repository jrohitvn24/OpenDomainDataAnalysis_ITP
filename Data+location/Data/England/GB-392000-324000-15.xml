    This year Stafford Rangers were    
champions of the Northern Premier      
League.  They celebrated by having two 
discos - one to which the public were  
invited to meet the players - a dinner 
dance, and a meal at the Swan Hotel.   
                                       
    Their cake was decorated in black  
and white, the colours of the team.    
They keep the trophy in the Board Room.
Each player was given a silver goblet. 
                                       
    Their player of the year was Peter 
Carr who was voted for by the          
supporters.                            
                                       
    Next year Stafford Rangers will be 
in the Gola League which was called the
Alliance Premier League.
