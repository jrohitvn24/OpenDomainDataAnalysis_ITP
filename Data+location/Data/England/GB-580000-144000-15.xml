		<title>15HEADCORN'S LOCAL CONCERN'S</title>
		<content> One of the pressing concerns to the   
 villagers of Headcorn and its visitors
 is the{problem of parking spaces}for  
 vehicles of all sorts. Moves to       
 provide a car park have,until now,not 
 succeeded. However there is a long    
 awaited plan to build a{by-pass}to the
 E. of the village. This should ease   
 the traffic congestion. As yet there  
 is no full-scale{public library,}but  
 the planned conversion of part of the 
 Primary School is well advanced. To   
 the S. of the village is{Shenley      
{Airfield}which causes annoyance to    
 some residents with the sound of light
 aircraft performing acrobatics or     
 releasing parachutists. There are     
 often complaints about the lack of    
 facilities for the{removal of bulky   
{household rubbish.}Because of the poor
 bus service some parents wish to see a
{free school bus service}to Tenterden. </content>
