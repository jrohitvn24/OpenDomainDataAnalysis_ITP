		<content> There is concern in the village of{   
{Treviscoe}about possible decline of   
 the village due to loss of amenities. 
 The{village shop/post office}closed   
 for several months in 1984 causing    
 great concern.                        
 For a good number of years the{school}
 has been under threat of closure.The  
 opening of a new school building in   
 St. Stephen prompted the County to    
 suggest closure at public meetings in 
 1983 and 1985.Strong opposition from  
 the community caused the plan to be   
 put aside.Parents would like to see   
 the school provided with indoor       
 toilets.A plan for this has had to be 
 postponed for financial reasons.      
 The public{bus service}is infrequent  
 and there has been discussion on the  
 possibility of operating a{community  
{bus.}                                 
                                       </content>
