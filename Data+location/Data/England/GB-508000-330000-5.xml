   Originally, part of the present     
 garage site was a blacksmith's, owned 
 by Andrew Graves in 1880.             
   The business was then bought, to    
 store steam traction engines. It was  
 then taken over and turned into a     
 garage.                               
   Nowadays,it is a vehicle repair     
 shop, M.O.T. station and petrol       
 station. The manager's wife is also   
 his secretary.                        
   The manager keeps up the tradition  
 by making gates and other wrought     
 ironwork in his spare time.
