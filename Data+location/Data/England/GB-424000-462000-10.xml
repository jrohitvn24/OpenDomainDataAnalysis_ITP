		<content> The C.E. Church is dedicated to St.   
 John the Evangelist.and replaces the  
 old church of St. John of which only  
 the tower remains which stands in the 
 fields in the middle of the parish.   
 The Archbishop of York appointed a    
 Forester for his hunting ground       
 "chase".  He was called John Wallworth
 and he lived at Raventoft's Hall.     
 People grumbled as they had to walk 8 
 miles to the nearest church at Kirby  
 Malzeard four times a year for holy   
 days. So John Wallworth built them a  
 church in the middle of the parish    
 with five stone bridle paths from     
 every side, in the year 1460. The new 
 church was built in 1888. The vicar is
 Reverend S.D. Askew.                  
 The Roman Catholic Church priest is   
 called Father Pepper.                 
 There is also a Methodist Church at   
 Shaw Mills. Reverend C. Stark.        </content>
