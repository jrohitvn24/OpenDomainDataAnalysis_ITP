		<title>10RECREATION IN CHITTERNE</title>
		<content> Chitterne has a sportsfield with      
 swings and a slide for children, and  
 there are goal posts for football. It 
 is also used for an annual gymkhana   
 and fete organised and run locally.   
 When there is snow several villagers  
 have been observed out on their skiis,
 whilst others come out with their     
 sledges and those who have neither use
 fertilizer bags, and much fun is had  
 on the local slopes.                  
 Many people enjoy walking and riding, 
 but access to M.O.D. land in the      
 vicinity north of the village is      
 restricted.                           
 A more unusual pastime is campanology 
 and a few people ring the Church bells
 regularly in Chitterne and other      
 nearby villages. Chitterne has five   
 bells.
