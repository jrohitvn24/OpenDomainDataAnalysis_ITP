		<content> Villagers tend to be more broadminded,
 entertained and educated by the media,
 especially TV. Very keen on Sunday    
 school families attend chapel together
 Methodism has strong roots here.C of E
 worshippers tend to be elderly.Another
 force in the community is the Jehovahs
 Witness.Mrs. Sweeney the shopkeeper   
 recently started Saturday school for  
 church and other children.Parents help
 and it appears to be thriving.There is
 no Sunday school in the village.Some  
 farming wives plan to raise upwards of
 4 children.The notion that children no
 longer need to be educated before     
 junior class has lost ground over the 
 last decade.It is not now a forgone   
 conclusion that offspring will take up
 farming in fathers footsteps.Cornish  
 people on the whole are reserved.Grand
 parents are expected and want to play 
 a large part within the family unit.  </content>
