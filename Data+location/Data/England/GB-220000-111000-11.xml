		<title>11Law and Order in Morwenstow</title>
		<content> Law and order are defined by common   
 and statute law. Statute law is       
 enacted by Parliament being the       
 elected legislature of the country.   
 The enforcing of the law and          
 maintenance of order is the           
 responsibility of the{Devon and       
{Cornwall Constabulary}(total strength 
 2,734). Morwenstow is policed from    
 Bude which has a strength of 17 men.  
 From this complement, a 24 hour patrol
 system is maintained with the use of  
 patrol vehicles fitted with VHF/UHF   
 radios. The radio gives access to PNC 
 which  keeps records of missing       
 persons, stolen vehicles etc. However,
 each parish within the Bude section   
 area has a community officer who will 
 deal with all matters for that parish.
 He is also responsible for the forming
 of contacts within the parish.
