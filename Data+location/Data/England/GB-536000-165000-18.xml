		<content>{A typical weekday in our house.}      
My mother goes to work and comes home  
about four o'clock. My brother goes to 
a day nursery. When my mother returns  
she lets the dog out and starts cook-  
ing. She then sits down in the lounge  
and reads, while I do some work and    
practise my recorder.Afterwards I read 
a book or play outside. After tea I    
have a bath or watch TV. I go to bed at
nine o'clock.

day. About one o'clock we normally have
a roast dinner.It's nearly always chic-
ken but occasionally beef or lamb.We go
to see nanny. Occasionally we walk the 
dog on Hayes Common.Sometimes Dad takes
us swimming.In the evening we may watch
TV or play Business or Monopoly.
