		<content> and Seniors when I was little,so it   
 shows you how many children there is  
 now.The shops have changed.Lots of    
 things have.When I was smaller the    
 police station wasn't behind Moody's  
 as it is now.It used to be a farm.All 
 of those things have changed.         
 Do you use the Community Centre?      
 No,I don't use it but I work there.My 
 husband uses it a lot.He plays squash 
 there and runs the squash team.Claire 
 goes to the netball every week and    
 sometimes goes to the  Senior Youth   
 Club there.There is a lot of things   
 going on at the Community Centre.I    
 don't think it is publicized enough.If
 they publicized it more they would get
 more people going.                    
 Do you always use the shops in the    
 village?                              
 No.
