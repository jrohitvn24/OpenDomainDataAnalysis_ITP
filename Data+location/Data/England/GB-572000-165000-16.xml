		<content>Churchlands Old People's Home is run   
by Kent County Council and has 61      
residents. There are far more elderly  
ladies than men. This shows that women 
have a greater life expectancy than    
men. Churchlands is a home for the     
physically infirm and some of the      
residents are senile,which means that  
their brains do not get enough blood.  
People living there have all kinds of  
conditions ranging from arthritis to   
strokes. The home opened in 1966,so it 
is now 19 years old. Some of the       
residents share rooms but about 20     
have their own rooms. The old people   
give their pensions to the people who  
run the homes and they get about 8     
pounds a week in pocket money. There   
are no restrictions on visiting hours. 
The people spend much of the day       
sitting staring alone with their       
memories.                              </content>
