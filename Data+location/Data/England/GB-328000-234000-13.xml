		<title>13THE GHOST AT THE POST OFFICE</title>
		<content> It is said that at Michaelchurch      
 Escley Post Office there is a         
{ghost.}Many times the post mistress   
 has put things away and then can't    
 find them again, only for them to turn
 up in a completely different place.She
 herself has never seen the ghost,     
 though others have.However other      
{strange things have happened}to       
 her.She has planted flowers,and they  
 have grown in a different place.Once  
 she looked after some keys to her     
 neighbours house.She lost them but    
 they turned up across the road back in
 the persons house.She has also seen a 
{light flickering}on the wall.Every    
 time she puts a certain shaped mirror 
 in the bathroom she always finds them 
 broken on the floor.Her grandson has  
 seen{ghostly feet}walking along under 
 a door when no one else was in the    
 house.                                </content>
