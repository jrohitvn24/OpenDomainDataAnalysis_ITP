Mr Mumford.One day was spent with him  
buying meat. He goes to Weddels meat   
market in Market Harborough.He likes to
see his meat before buying,lots of     
butchers just telephone orders today.  
There is one van just kept for meat.He 
bought  half pigs,gammon,beef,English  
lamb and  New Zealand lamb,liver,steak,
it was a lot of meat and cost $2,500.  
That was to stock two shops,one in     
Culworth that has a village round and  
one in Banbury.As well as delivering,  
receiving deliveries and   serving in  
the   shops,MrMumford and family spend 
 some time manufacturing sausages,     
rolling brisket,boning meat and mixing 
and pressing out beef burgers,the best 
for miles.Christan,Carl and Matthew    
help their mum and dad with lots of
