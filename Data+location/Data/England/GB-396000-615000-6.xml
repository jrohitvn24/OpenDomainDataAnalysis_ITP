		<title>06THE RIVER BREAMISH</title>
		<content> The river Breamish is the dominant    
 stream of the area.In the west of this
 area it is within ten miles of its    
 source and is little more than a      
 rocky, fast-flowing stream. In the far
 west of the area it is in a valley    
 more than 1000 feet deep. In the east 
 of the area the valley sides are also 
 steep-sided.In the middle of this area
 the valley sides are less steep and   
 less deep. The river is generally     
 shallow with occasional deep          
 pools, containing fish such as trout  
 and salmon. In most places there is a 
 broad stony bed with a relatively     
 narrow stream flowing through it.The  
 river is prone to flooding            
 particularly during winter rains or   
 thawing snow. The river has several   
 tributaries such as the Linhope       
 burn, but these are usually only small
 streams. There is little pollution.   </content>
