		<content> I live with my Mum,Dad and sister     
 in the Odde Cottage,Cock Road,Little  
 Maplestead.I am eight years old. My   
 sister is called Evelyn. Last Saturday
 in the morning I dressed and had my   
 breakfast.After that I went on my new 
 roller skates. Then I went to a disco 
 dancing class. When I got home I had a
 bath. I had my dinner which was       
 chicken and potatoes. Then I helped my
 dad put the food in the car because it
 was my birthday party in the village  
 hall. I had a lovely party with some  
 of my friends.For my presents I had   
 Tinkerbell Talc and Tinkerbell nail   
 varnish.We had a Magician called Uncle
 Jim.He was excellent at tricks. He    
 made me a dog out of balloons. My     
 Grandad and Grandma came at 7.30p.m.  
 They bought a "Guess Who?" game. I    
 went to bed at 8.00p.m.
