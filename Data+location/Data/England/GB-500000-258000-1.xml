 The area covered by the survey is     
 gently rolling countryside sloping    
 down to the valley of the river Great 
 Ouse in the west.                     
 It is predominantly agriculture-with  
 large open arable fields and few      
 hedgerows but there are some smaller  
 pasture fields used for grazing       
 livestock.                            
 There are two centres of population   
 the eastern edge of the large village 
 of Sharnbrook and the smaller village 
 of Bletsoe.                           
 Both of these may be described as     
 dormitory villages with most of the   
 working population travelling to      
 Bedford.Colworth House(Unilever       
 Research)or London.The latter is made 
 possible by the newly electrified     
 raillink between Bedford and London   
 and the nearness to the M.1.          </content>
