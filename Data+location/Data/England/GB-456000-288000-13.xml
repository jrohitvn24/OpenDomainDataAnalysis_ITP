		<title>13SOCIAL CONCERNS ASHBY MAGNA</title>
		<content> The major local concern is that of    
 land use.  Newcomers to the villages  
 are attracted by unspoiled nature and 
 old properties.  The longer standing  
 residents are worried about ageing and
 reduction in size of the population   
 and thus loss of local services.  They
 therefore support the sale of land for
 housing development to see new young  
 faces.  There is however concern from 
 some residents about loss of village  
 character with inappropriately        
 designed new houses amongst the old.  
 Sale of land to the County Council    
 also causes concern to local farmers. 
 This raises land prices above that    
 which small farmers are able to pay.  
 The Council has now bought a large    
 area around Ashby Magna.  This area is
 also now closed to fox hunting because
 of Council policies.
