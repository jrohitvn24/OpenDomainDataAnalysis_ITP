		<title>12German Defences in St.Ouen's</title>
		<content>   During the German occupation an     
 anti-aircrapt gun battery was         
 constructed at Les Landes.  The       
 battery was codenamed {Batterie Moltke
 .  In 1944, plans were prepared for   
 the battery to be turned into a full  
 blown naval battery.  This was never  
 completed.  To avoid abuse of the     
 ammunition tunnel complex, the        
 installions have been filled in and   
 covered with earth.                   
   A major observation tower was built 
 on the cliff tops overlooking the sea.
  The tower was codenamed {MP3}.  Since
 the end of the Occupation, the tower  
 has been abandoned and all the        
 interior fittings are gone.  But the  
 vast concrete structure will stand for
 centuries unless deliberately         
 destroyed.
