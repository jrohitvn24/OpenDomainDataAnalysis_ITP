		<title>11  THE VILLAGE HALL</title>
		<content>{The Village Hall}was built in 1950    
 just after the Second World War.Then  
 in{1964}it was bought for{Â£200}but now
 it is worth{Â£30,000.In the same year  
 an extension was built.It is run by a 
{committee}which consist of{16}people  
 who own it,and they don't get any     
 financial help.The sort of activities 
 that go on there are the{W.I,Brownies 
 and{Guides,dancing,the doctors surgery
 etc.All the groups like this have to  
 pay a rent,but if it's just something 
 like a{party or a disco}you pay so    
 much to hire.{The Village Hall}has a  
 bar for the drinks a kitchen and a    
 stage.They have to have a{licence}for 
 all the{safety things}involved.Just   
 lately a new extension was put on so  
 they would have more room to store all
 the{youthclub}and{play group}things.
