		<content> The centre of this area, situated west
 of Melksham, is the historic house of 
 Great Chalfield. Broughton Gifford is 
 situated in the east, in the middle of
 a triangle of main roads, reached only
 by narrow country lanes. The north and
 west is entirely agricultural land and
 farms. On the southern edge the small 
 town of Holt straddles the A3107. The 
 nearest large towns are Bath 10 miles 
 west, Trowbridge 5 miles south and    
 Chippenham 8 miles north-east.        
 EMPLOYMENT                            
 The people living in this area are    
 employed in agriculture or travel to  
 larger towns nearby to work in light  
 industry, the Civil Service and the   
 associated services.
