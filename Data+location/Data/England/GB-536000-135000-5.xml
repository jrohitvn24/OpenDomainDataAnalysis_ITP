		<title>05EAST GRINSTEAD THE PEOPLE</title>
		<content> The town is now almost completely     
 surrounded by modern housing estates, 
 some still being completed. The houses
 are new, bright, varied and expensive 
 and to some extent this characterises 
 the people in them. They tend to be   
 young and mobile, both in terms of    
 transport and domicile. They tend to  
 be bright and varied in occupation and
 background. They also tend to be      
 middle class, conventional and        
 conservative with an above average    
 income. East Grinstead is little      
 troubled by the industrial &amp; social   
 problems of other parts of the country
 and this is reflected in the prevalent
 political attitudes . Some of the     
 tradition folk remain: Sussex people  
 with roots in the area nd more working
 class atitudes. Many have lived in    
 their Victorian houses all their lives
 , others live in the farms &amp; cottages.</content>
