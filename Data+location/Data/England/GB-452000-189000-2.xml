		<content>There are five active farms in our     
Block.                                 
Willington Down Farm has been owned by 
Mr Hockley since 1980.  Mr Hedges of   
nearby Fulscot Manor used to own it.   
There are 600 acres of land at         
Willington Down, of which 400 are grown
for wheat to make bread, 100 are grown 
for barley and 100 for oil seed rape,  
which is used for cooking oil and      
margarine.  The crops are harvested in 
August.  Two men work on the farm in   
Winter and three in Summer.  The oldest
barn on the farm is 200 years old.     
Every two years they have to buy new   
transport, which costs about 36,000    
pounds.                                
Ladygrove Farm is owned by Mr and Mrs  
Hiskins.  It is not actually farmed    
anymore, although Mr Hiskins does grow 
grass for hay.  He still has the pig   
sties, where the hay is stored.        </content>
