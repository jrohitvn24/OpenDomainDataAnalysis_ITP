		<title>19THE DOUGLAS MACMILLAN HOME</title>
		<content>The Health authority gives 260 pounds  
for each of the 15 beds, weekly. The   
money for the other beds is raised in  
the community. Some money is raised    
when that people die do not have       
flowers at the funeral, but have       
donations sent to the home. People do  
not only go into the home when they are
dying, but also for pain control. The  
cancer is not actually treated at the  
home but sometimes chemo therapy is    
given. The home does not just help the 
patient it helps the patient's family  
to understand. Even if the patient     
dies the family are still helped by the
home. Not everyone dies from cancer,   
some can live with it. When the        
patients go home a day care nurse      
visits them 2 or 3 times a week. The   
patients come from all over North      
Staffs,and are refered to the home by  
doctors.It is not a depressing place.  </content>
