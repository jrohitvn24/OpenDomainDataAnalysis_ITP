		<title>08ORMSKIRK PARISH CHURCH</title>
		<content> The church of St Peter and St Paul is 
 Ormskirk's most famous historic       
 building. The Name "Ormskirk" suggests
 Scandinavian origin and the church is 
 one of only four in the country to    
 have both a tower and a steeple. The  
 steeple was built in 1430 much earlier
 than the tower which was needed to    
 house the bells of Burscough Priory   
 following the dissolution of the      
 monastries. The church is in the      
 Diocese of Liverpool and employs a    
 full time vicar and a curate. It has  
 many uniformed groups such as scouts  
 and guides and other organisations    
 such as toddler groups and a youth    
 club.                                 
   Once a month, all the uniformed     
 groups parade to show the church at   
 work. Ormskirk C. of E. primary School
 is connecvted with the church holding 
 Christmas and Easter services there.  </content>
