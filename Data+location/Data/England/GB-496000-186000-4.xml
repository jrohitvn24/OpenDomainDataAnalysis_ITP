		<title>04GARDEN COTTAGE  *  HEDGERLEY</title>
		<content>                                       
     This is an old cottage that was   
once part of Hedgerley Park Estate. It 
was called Garden Cottage because six  
gardeners used to live there. The      
cottage is 250 yeras old. The house    
opposite was a butlers house but it is 
not quite as old as Garden Cottage.    
Some of the bricks in the walls were   
made in the Hedgerley brick kiln.      
Garden cottage has a very large walled 
garden. At the back of the garden is a 
big black gate that leads to a wood.   
There is an orchard at the side of the 
garden which was on a map of Hedgerley 
in 1670.                               
     Many of the men were farmers and  
also some worked in the slate houses.  
     The first shop in Hedgerley was a 
Post Office at Dean Cottages.
