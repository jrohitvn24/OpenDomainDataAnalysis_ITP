		<title>16Mill Farm, Horningsham</title>
		<content>                                       
 The farm has 74 hectares(186 acres) of
 land and is situated in the heart of  
 the Village. The farm is very         
 prosperous and concentrates on beef   
 cattle and sheep. The beef cattle are 
 fattened up on silage and hay before  
 being taken to market. The sheep are  
 put out to graze and are sheared once 
 a year at the beginning of the Summer.
 Eigth weeks before lambing they are   
 fed on 'sheep cake'.                  
 Wheat and barley are grown each year  
 and much land is given over to hay    
 making which is stored for the Winter.
 The farm got its name because corn    
 used to be ground there although the  
 mill wheel has now disappeared        
 although the mill race is still there;
 the cog-room has be turned into a     
 living room. The building dates from  
 the sixteenth century.                </content>
