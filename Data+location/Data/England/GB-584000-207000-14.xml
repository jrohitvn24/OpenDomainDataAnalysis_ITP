		<title>14Heybridge and Shopping</title>
		<content>    In our survey nobody who lives in  
 Heybridge does their main weekly      
 shopping there. This is because there 
 are no shops or supermarkets of any   
 real size. Instead residents have to  
 shop in other towns.                  
 Results : Maldon                  68% 
           Chelmsford/Springfield  28% 
           Colchester               8% 
    In the future, however, this may   
 change because there are plans to     
 convert the now disused{Bentall's}site
 into a large shopping precinct housing
 the complete needs of the locality. In
 our survey, when asked, "Do you think 
 that Bentall's site should become a   
 shopping precinct?", 83% said Yes. Of 
 the 17% that did not want a precinct  
 some had businesses in Maldon or      
 Heybridge which they thought would be 
 adversely affected and others did not 
 want the extra traffic it might bring.</content>
