		<title>19KEMBLE VILLAGE HALL</title>
		<content>  The{Village Hall}was built in 1899.  
 There is a Village Hall Committee who 
 make sure that everything is kept in  
 good condition. A lot of clubs go     
 there like the Dance Club and the     
 Cubs and the Playgroup. The School    
 uses it for gym, P.E. and Drama.      
 Grown-ups use it for discos and       
 parties, concerts and dances. The     
 Village Hall has been decorated and   
 toilets and a new kitchen have been   
 put in. A car park has been built     
 behind the Village Hall. Most of the  
 work was done by the people in the    
 village with the help of a grant from 
 the{Gloucestershire Community Council.
