    Most people who were asked said    
 that they shopped in Chesterfield only
 once a week. It is too far for most   
 people to travel everyday.            
                                       
    The shops in Chesterfield offer a  
 wider range of products at lower      
 prices. Most people appear to do one  
 main shop in Chesterfield each week   
 and rely on their local shops for     
 everyday items.
