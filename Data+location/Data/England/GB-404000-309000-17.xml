The Buildings and Grounds.             
  The approach to the hospital is a    
long tarmac drive lined with trees of  
many different types,Lime,Oak,Horse    
Chestnut and Pine.The driveway is very 
majestic with a gatehouse at the       
entrance and long strips of grass along
each side of it.                       
  Then you see lots of old fashioned   
buildings.There is then a very large   
building.You can tell that it is       
Victorian by the windows which are Dome
shaped with a row of cream,blue and red
coloured bricks over  the top.The      
hospital was built originally in 1864. 
  Over the entrance is a clock         
tower.There is a square block at the   
top with a clock face on each side.    
  The hospital stands in its own       
grounds of 60 acres and also owns a    
farm.                                  </content>
