 East Sussex and reaches the sea{34    
{miles}from its source.The river flows 
 through Rye and {enters the sea at Rye
{Bay. }On the east side of the river is
 Rye Golf Club and Camber Road whilst  
 on the west side is the village of Rye
 Harbour.The dunes on the east bank are
 the highest points of Romney Marsh.   
    {A fishing fleet of 20_30 boats}   
 sails the River Rother at high        
 tide.Fishing takes place 8 miles out  
 in Rye Bay where whiting, Dover sole  
 and plaice are the main fish caught.

 1300 tons )unload at the timber       
 wharf,Rye Harbour.In 1984 a seal
