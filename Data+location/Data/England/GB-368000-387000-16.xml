		<title>16Lymm's French Connection.</title>
		<content> Since 1968 Lymm has been twinned with 
 the town of Meung-sur-Loire in        
 France.From the outset the emphasis of
 the association has been more upon    
 individual contact and exchange than  
 upon official visits.Though the       
 organising committees on each side of 
 the channel,at least one party travels
 between the towns each year and is    
 hosted and entertained by families on 
 the other side.Out of such trips has  
 grown a steadily increasing number of 
 personal friendships,including        
 marriage.These are consided the real  
 fruits and raison d'etre of the       
 twinning.  The twinning society has   
  always been happy to assist group    
 exchanges  with advice  and           
 information.Most importantly there    
 have for many years been exchanges    
 between Lymm Oughtrington High School 
 and the secondary school.             </content>
