 cucumbers.The area of Hedon Growers is

 plants.After they take them across to 
 the grading area,where they shrinkwrap
 them and put them into boxes.Some of  
 the cucumbers are sent to the         
 supermarkets and others are for the   
 special area.In the special area they 
 chop the cucumbers in half then they  
 put them into bags.After that they    
 stack them into brown crates then into
 the lorries at East Coast Salads.{
