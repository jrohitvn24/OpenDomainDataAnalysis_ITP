		<title>09A DAY IN MY LIFE</title>
		<content> I wake up at 7.00 and read until 7.30.
 In the morning we chat and don't      
 listen to the radio or watch breakfast
 television. Dad and my brother leave  
 home at 8.15.My brother goes to Grove 
 Comprehensive school and dad works in 
 the National Westminster bank in      
 Market Drayton. I usually walk to     
 school with Mum it isn't very far. I  
 have sandwiches for lunch but you can 
 have school dinners. When I get home I
 have lots of different clubs to go to 
 like on Monday I go to Tennis,Tuesday 
 I go to Sewing,Wednesday I go to games
 and Cricket,Thursday I go to Brownies 
 and Youth Club and on Friday I go to  
 Ballet. If I haven't got a club to go 
 to I play outside. In the evening I   
 watch television if there's something 
 to watch, if it's worthwhile.
