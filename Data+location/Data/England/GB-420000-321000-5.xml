		<title>05A BUS DRIVER IN BURTON</title>
		<content>Page 1(of 2)                           
After working at a brewery and a power 
station Mr. Ireland took to driving a  
double-decked, 155 horse-power bus     
round Burton, carrying up to 78 people 
at a time.                             
   Mr. Ireland enjoys his work. He gets
to know the town and the district,     
and, since changing to one-man buses,  
he meets many people every day. It is, 
however, a very stressful job, and many
drivers suffer from nerves through     
having to drive to a time-table despite
bad weather, traffic jams and other    
hold-ups.                              
   Fortunately,Burton is a quiet town, 
and there is no trouble with rowdy     
passengers,as there is in the big      
cities.Sometimes bad-tempered people   
annoy the driver,but he has to remember
he is a public servant and stay cool.
