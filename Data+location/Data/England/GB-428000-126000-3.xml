		<content> You are likely to see some interesting
 vehicles in Lockerley village. The    
 jobs they are doing are:- cranes and  
 excavators working on the pipeline;   
 timber lorries; tractors; combine     
 harvesters and cattle trucks.         
 The pipeline is being constructed from
 an oil refinery at Fawley to the      
 Midlands. It crosses the B3084 at     
 approx. grid ref 316285 continuing SW 
 to cross the road to East Tytherley at
 grid ref. 298267, and travels SW      
 across to Critchells Green grid ref.  
 295261.                               
 The timber lorries are travelling     
 through the village to the saw mill at
 W.Dean. They are carrying softwood    
 from the New Forest, oak from         
 Portsmouth, beech from W.Meon and     
 mahogony from Brazil, W.Africa and    
 Malaysia. Milk is taken to the        
 Salisbury bottling plant by tanker.   </content>
