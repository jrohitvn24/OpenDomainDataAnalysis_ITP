		<title>04A Hedgerow By The Mill</title>
		<content> Ten of us went to study the hedgerow  
 by the mill. We decided to study a    
 thirty metre stretch. We counted the  
 trees. There were hawthorn, sycamore, 
 elm, hazel, elder and dogwood. We     
 found dogroses, cowparsley, thistles, 
 buttercups, white clover, red campion,
 forget_me_not, goosegrass, nettles,   
 Lords_and_Ladies, different kinds of  
 grasses and a puff ball, all growing  
 in the thirty metre stretch. I saw a  
 butterfly which I thought was a red   
 admiral. Some people found ladybirds  
 and flies. We saw some aphids on a    
 sorrel dock plant being guarded by    
 ants. If we kept quiet we could hear a
 lot of birds. We saw house martins,   
 swallows, chaffinches, blackbirds,    
 crows ,swifts, starlings and, on the  
 way back, we saw some long_tailed     
 tits. The weather was sunny and hot   
 that day.                             </content>
