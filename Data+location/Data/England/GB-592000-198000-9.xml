		<content>{Smyatts Farm}is in Burnham Road. It is
 a nursery with twenty acres of land.  
 One and a half acres are covered with 
 glass houses. Mr. Pipe and his brother
 run it and their wives work on the    
 farm too. They only employ one other  
 person and she was already working    
 there when Mr. Pipe went there thirty 
 four years ago. In the greenhouses    
 are{tomato plants}and{lettuce         
 and{cabbage seedlings.}Outside there  
 are{strawberries}and{potatoes}growing.
 Some of the{potatoes }are under a     
 polythene tunnel which warms up the   
 ground and makes them grow more       
 quickly.On one side of a field there  
 is a reservoir to supply all the water
 needed for the crop. The{strawberries 
 and{potatoes}are sold at the farm gate
 and all the other produce goes to     
 local shops or Nine Elms vegetable    
 market in London.                     </content>
