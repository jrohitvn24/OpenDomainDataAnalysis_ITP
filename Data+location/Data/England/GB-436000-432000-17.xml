		<title>17COLTON FARM NEAR WHITKIRK</title>
		<content> At the southern end of Colton Village 
 lies{Colton Farm}which is owned by{   
{Mr.Terry.}He has about{40 animals}but 
 Colton Farm is still mainly a{mixed   
{farm.}He grows crops such as{wheat,   
{potatoes, corn, grass for his animals 
{and rape for seed oil.}Mr.Terry's farm
 covers about{200 acres}and he employs 
 two other men to help him in his work.
 The farm house is about 200 or more   
 years old, as are the stables, but the
 barns and other buildings are of newer
 construction.{In summer}his livestock,
 mostly cattle, are outside but{in     
{winter}they are usually kept inside.  
 When we visited the farm in June they 
 were busy sorting and bagging         
 potatoes, some of which would be sold 
 locally but mostly for selling at the 
 market.
