		<title>09Mattishall Nonconformists.</title>
		<content>    In Mattishall,at different times   
 over the last 330 years,the Anglican  
 and Roman Catholic Churches have vied 
 with Independents (later known as     
 Congregationalists and more recently  
 as the United Reformed Church),       
 Quakers,Primitive Methodists (now     
 united with the Methodist Church) and 
 Evangelicals.                         
    The growth of non-conformity       
 brought many religious and secular    
 benefits to the community.All         
 responsibility in the parish churches 
 was in the hands of the vicar         
 appointed from outside,and of a very  
 small oligarchy.But the chapels were  
 close and very democratic fellowships 
 where each member had a direct        
 responsibility for the spiritual and  
 material welfare of the congregation  
 and of each individual.
