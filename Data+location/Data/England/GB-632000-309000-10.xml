		<title>10SHOPPING IN BLOFIELD</title>
		<content>  In Blofield there are several shops  
 including a small supermarket, aPost  
 Office and general stores, a bakery, a
 newsagent, a hairdresser, a fish and  
 chip shop and a clothes shop.         
   Most of the shops are quite small   
 and are run as family businesses.     
 They are mostly used by people living 
 in Blofield for their everyday needs, 
 but many people travel into Norwich by
 car for their large weekly shop of    
 groceries, going to one of the large  
 supermarkets, such as Asda or         
 Sainsburys,where there is a larger    
 choice of goods and prices are        
 cheaper.  They also use the larger    
 shops in the city for such things as  
 clothes,shoes and electrical goods.
