		<content> In 1925 Mr.J.Hannaford  started a     
 butcher's shop in Lydford.He used     
 to deliver his meat to his customers  
 by horse and cart. This was a slow way
 of delivering his meat and also the   
 flies got at the meat because the meat
 was not covered.Mr. Hannaford got his 
 meat locally from farmers.The animals 
 were killed daily in his slaughter    
 house. Nowadays his son runs the      
 business.He is called Mr .S.Hannaford 
 He gets his meat from  an Abattoir and
 it comes by lorry which keeps it      
 fresh. Mr. Hannaford keeps his meat in
 a fridge. His best customers are the  
 Inns and Hotels. He delivers his meat 
 in a van.
