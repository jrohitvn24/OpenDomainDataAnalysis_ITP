		<title>13HOME LIFE RECREATION</title>
		<content>We decided to move to Perton last      
October, at first we did not dream of  
coto live here because we did not like 
the area. But, one house took or fancy.
The next thing I knew we were moving.  
   We are now very happy living in     
Perto and we are pleased that we moved 
here. The Village provides a good range
of entertainments. The Perton Players  
who perform at the  Community Centre   
are a good example. There are of course
 Clubs that anyone can join. For       
children it could be the Saturday      
Discos or for adults  an Evening       
Institute course run at the Middle     
School. Perton church also runs a      
series of actiovities in the community.
