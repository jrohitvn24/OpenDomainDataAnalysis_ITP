		<title>13Where I Play.</title>
		<content>   I mostly play in my bedroom. I play 
 with my Barbie doll with my sister and
 my friends. Sometimes I sit at my desk
 writing or drawing. I like making     
 things at my desk. Sometimes I lie on 
 my bed reading. I like to play hide   
 and seek with my friends. I hide under
 my sister's bed or in our cupboard.   
 Sometimes I put a mat on the floor and
 do gymnastics.   {(Rachel,aged 9)}    
                                       
   I play at the bottom of Pinfield    
 Close where there's a building site. I
 play in the sand with my friend. We   
 make tunnels for the model cars to go 
 through. Sometimes we play on the muck
 hills behind the houses. We play at   
 war, using sticks as guns.We use      
 scaffolding poles for bazookas and we 
 build barricades to play in.
