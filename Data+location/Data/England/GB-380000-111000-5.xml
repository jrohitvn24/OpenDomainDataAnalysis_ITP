		<title>05A SHILLINGSTONE VIEWPOINT</title>
		<content> It was by pure chance that we set up  
 home in Shillingstone in 1975-a happy 
 chance as we soon discovered from the 
 friendliness and strong community     
 spirit here,centered largely on the   
 Parish Church and Primary School.     
 Certainly a great deal of the         
 friendliness stems from a strong      
 communal desire to support and        
 maintain the village school.That is   
 what makes Shillingstone such a       
 wortwhile and  rewarding              
 place in which to live.We have found  
 that "native" villagers accept        
 newcomers like ourselves without too  
 much suspicion.Perhaps this is because
 there are fewer class barriers than in
 some communities and more cooperation 
 and support for village organisations 
 by all sections of the community than 
 is usual. Chris Whitfeld.
