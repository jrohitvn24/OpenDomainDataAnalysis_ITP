		<title>17REVIVAL: VITICULTURE</title>
		<content> Until recently{viticulture            
 appeared to have disappeared          
 from Britain. 'Tapestry Wines' has two
 vineyards in Gloucestershire; one is  
 near Cirencester and the other in     
 Apperley,the latter being sold under  
 sold under the label of 'Deerhurst'.  
 The underlying{sandstone}of Apperley, 
 30 metres above sea level, has led    
 to the production of a wine blended   
 from a French grape, the 'Madelaine   
 Angevine' and 20% from the German     
 'Reichensteiner'. It is aimed to      
 produce a dry, crispy wine. There are 
 three acres of vines in Apperley and  
 are all hand picked in September.     
 Grapes harvested at Cirencester are   
 transported to the {winery}at Apperley
 for crushing, fermentation and        
 blending. Providing guided tours the {
{vinyard }acts as a tourist attraction.
