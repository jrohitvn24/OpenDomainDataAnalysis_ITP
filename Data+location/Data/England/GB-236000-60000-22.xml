The village has one shop left now, which is a general store with your daily goods, magazines and papers, an off licence as well as other things and a post office is also attached to it. &lt;br />The local pub is called the Buller's Arms which has a bar and a lounge which is well used. It has basic pub meals, a pub quiz on a wednesday occasional discos and other live music. It has your normal dart board and pool table which are used for pleasure as well as being used for local pub leagues.   &lt;br />
