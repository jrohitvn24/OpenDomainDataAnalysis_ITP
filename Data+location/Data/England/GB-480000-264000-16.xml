		<title>16THE MANOR POND - MEARS ASHBY</title>
		<content>                                       
                                       
The Manor Pond is centrally situated   
in the village of MEARS ASHBY, in the  
garden of the Manor House, near to the 
church.                                
                                       
Three hundred years ago, in 1785, the  
witch Sarah Bradshaw was ducked in the 
pond, and as a result she died.        
                                       
In the summer holiday the village      
celebrated the three hundredth         
anniversary of this event and          
reanacted the ducking.                 
                                       
The pageant was featured on the local  
television programme, Look East.
