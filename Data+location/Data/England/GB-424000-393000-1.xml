		<content> Most of our area lies in the Peak     
 Natonal  Park.The land rises to 381   
 metres between the Ewden Beck in the  
 north and the River Loxley in the     
 south.Moorland with cotton grass,     
 bilberry and heather is evident. Some 
 moorland has been drained and         
 fertilized. A small area has oilseed  
 rape growing. Grass is grown for      
 winter fodder and animals graze in    
 some fields. Two areas have been      
 planted with coniferous trees in the  
 last 50 years. There are also a few   
 wedges of deciduous woodland around   
 tributary streams.Narrow roads twist, 
 rise and fall haphazardly around.     
 Stone walls separate the fields. The  
 spoil heaps of a quarry look like     
 giant mole hills.Old stone farmhouses 
 are scattered around.The area is only 
 about 15 minutes from the centre of   
 Sheffield by car.                     </content>
