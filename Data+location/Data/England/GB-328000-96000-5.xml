		<content> The Axminster Bypass.                 
       Axminster is a very old town    
 with its foundations going back to pre
 Roman times.After a great fire in the 
 earlt 19th century the centre around  
 Trinity square was re built.          
      However this Victorian center was
 not built to cope with 20thcentury    
 traffic. Axminster has the main A35   
 trunk road running through it and the 
 very large trucks that now run on the 
 roads are not only damaging the road  
 but also the builfings and polluting  
 the environment. The biggest problem  
 is that two lorries cannot pass each  
 other easily in the towns narrow      
 streets. During the summer months this
 causes considerabe congestion and     
 makes it both dangerous and unpopular 
 to tourists and locals alike.The      
 government have promised t build a by 
 pass for the lasttwenty years.        </content>
