		<content> PE or assembly is when in the morning 
 our teacher reads a story, we sing a  
 hymn and have a prayer and then on a  
 Wednesday we do PE which is when we   
 leap over things and do handstands.   
                                       
 We do go out on outings to see things 
 like the Church and old houses  then  
 we go back to school and write and    
 draw what we saw.It is much more fun  
 than just writing out of books the    
 same thing every day. We are at school
 for six hours 9am-3pm five days a     
 week.

 We have lots of playground games.The  
 most popular is called punchball.You  
 have two teams.The fielding team has a
 bowler and backstop.The bowler throws 
 the ball and an opponent has to hit   
 the ball.To be out you are caught or  
 hit by the ball.  BY RICHARD HOBART.  </content>
