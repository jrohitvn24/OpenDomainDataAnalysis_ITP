		<title>14ARNCLIFFE - MIDDLE AGES</title>
		<content>   After Arncliffe came into the       
 possession of the Percy family, the   
 surrounding land formed part of the   
 forests of Littondale.  These forests 
 came under the control of the Abbey of
 Fountains, and there were many        
 disputes between the Abbey and the    
 Percy family over hunting rights.     
   The Cliffords gained possession of  
 the land during the Middle Ages, but  
 sold of much off their property to the
 local tenants during the 16th Century.
   Arncliffe was probably at its most  
 important during the eighteenth and   
 nineteenth centuries, when it was the 
 largest of the village communities in 
 the Dale. In the eighteenth century   
 the flour mill by Cowside Beck, which 
 dated from the Middle Ages, was       
 rebuilt with four stories and used as 
 a textile mill.  It finally closed in 
 1875, being converted to a dwelling.  </content>
