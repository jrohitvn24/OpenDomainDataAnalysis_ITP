		<content> The Anglo-Saxon{origin}of "Over" means
 "bank of the river".Land used to be   
 owned by Ramsey Abbey and Chatteris   
 Nunnery.Roman remains were found at   
 Coldharbour Farm at the Willingham    
 edge of the parish.The Ouse used to be
 the means of communication and boats  
 came up to the church site until the  
 fens were drained by Vermuyden.Dutch  
{houses}were built in the village-two  
 are still inhabited(12 Fen End &amp; 13   
 High St.).The old Court House,15 West 
 St. is made of wattle and daub with   
 overhanging upper storey and is still 
 occupied.In Elizabethan times, Over   
 was one of the largest villages in the
 county, having a market place opposite
 the church and an old Guild Hall      
 replaced by a new Town Hall in 1849   
 through the Over Town Lands Trust.The 
 Church school of 1843-1934 is now the 
 church hall and play group.           </content>
