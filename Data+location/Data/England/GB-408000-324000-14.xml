		<content> come out then we go in.The servers    
 serve out the food and scrape the     
 plates. When we come down from dinner 
 we play in the playground if we can go
 on the grass we usually play "Red     
 Rover" or "Forty Forty".When we go    
 back into the classroom we write about
 the Black Country Museum until twenty 
 past two.Then it is playtime ,after   
 that play Mr.Yeomans sometimes reads  
 us a story.At half past three it is   
 hometime and I walk home.When I get   
 home I take my coat and shoes off and 
 go into the kitchen to get a drink and
 a biscuit ,then go into the lounge to 
 watch television because "Dogtannian" 
 is on.When this is finished I usually 
 have my tea,after tea I play a game   
 and watch television or go outside and
 then get ready for bed.I read for a   
 bit then I go to sleep.
