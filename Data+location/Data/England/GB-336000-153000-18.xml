		<content>   THE NORTH SECTION OF THIS BLOCK IS  
DOMINATED BY THE RISING HILLS OF MENDIP
WITH THE LOX YEO VALLEY FORMING A      
CENTRAL DIVIDE THROUGH WHICH PASSES THE
BUSY M5.                               
   THESE HILLS OF CARBONIFEROUS        
LIMESTONE WITH THEIR RED SANDSTONE CORE
FORM AN UNDULATING LANDSCAPE FAMILIAR  
TO MANY PEOPLE WHO TODAY WALK OR RIDE  
THE MANY TRACKWAYS WHICH CROSS THEM.   
   WHERE SMALL SETTLEMENTS EXIST,THERE 
A SCAR IN THE HILLSIDE INDICATES THE   
SOURCE FOR MUCH OF THE STONE OF WHICH  
THE EARLY HOUSES ARE CONSTRUCTED.THUS  
THE UNSPOILT VILLAGES APPEAR TO RISE   
OUT OF THE HILLSIDE AND TO BE A PART OF
IT.THIS IS NOW OCCASIONALLY SPOILT BY  
BRICK BUILDINGS,CEMENT COVERED AND     
COLOUR WASHED.                         
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
