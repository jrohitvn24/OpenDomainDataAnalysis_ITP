		<title>04Hankham village</title>
		<content> Hankham is a small village which is   
 mentioned in the Domesday book:-It    
 says"In hankham the count has 1 hide  
 and \ of virgate.King Edward held it  
 .land for 1 plough .No return from    
 it."                                  
 On an old map  dated 1875 we          
 found Hankham spelt 'Hancome' and yet 
 on an earlier one, suposed to have    
 been 1724,it was spelt Hankham again. 
 We do not know the reason for this    
 change.The village lies on a hill     
 ridge which was once part of a        
 penisular surrouned by the sea,this   
 was in the days when Pevensey itself  
 was a port. The sea went nearly       
 Hailsham Station and on up towards    
 Magham Down.                          
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
