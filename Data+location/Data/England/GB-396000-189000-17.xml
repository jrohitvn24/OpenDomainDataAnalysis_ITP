 grassland used for grazing and the    
 making of silage and hay for Winter   
 fodder.Two thirds of the mown grass is
 made into silage,some in clamps,a     
 lesser amount into large round bales  
 weighing 1/2 ton,the other third being
 made into hay mostly for young calves.
{Dairy.}Seven dairy farms milk Friesian
 cows and one milks a herd of          
 Guernseys.The average herd is 100 head
 with followers.All milk is sold to the
 Milk Marketing Board for liquid       
 consumption (door-step delivery) Very 
 little is used for cheese and         
 butter-making.All farms have milk     
 quotas limiting the amount of milk    
 produced.The National quota is        
 12,500,000,000 litres.Average milk    
 price to farmers is 15p per litre.
