		<content>   {Mrs Garland}has lived in the       
 village for 12 years. She lives in a  
 small 300 year old{cottage}with a very
 pretty garden bordered by a mill      
 stream which is above the level of    
 the house.The cottage may have been a 
 barn at one time. There are several   
 steps up to the road outside.         
    When she first came to the village 
 there were no young families. There is
 no school in the village.{New houses  
 have just been built in St.Michael's  
 Close and there are to be 70 houses   
 near Warlands lane. There are more    
 children now but there is nothing in  
 the village for them to do.           
    Once along Mill Lane there used to 
 be a butcher who slaughtered his own  
 animals, a baker at the mill and a man
 who mended shoes.  Everyone grew their
 own vegetables. There was no need to  
 go out of the village.                </content>
