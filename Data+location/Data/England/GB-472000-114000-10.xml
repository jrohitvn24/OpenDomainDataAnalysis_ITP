		<title>10Home Life in Chalton</title>
		<content> Two households interviewed had no     
 pets. Cats were the most popular,     
 followed by dogs. Most widely used    
 shopping area; Petersfield although   
 Waitrose at Cowplain also popular.Most
 families  did   main  shopping weekly.
   Of amenities required in a hamlet,  
 all mentioned a freezer and a phone,  
 but overwhelmingly, the need for more 
 than one car.                         
    We asked the Middle School children
 how they spent a Sunday:Average rising
 time was 7.30am: nobody had a cooked  
 breakfast. Sunday morning activities: 
 walking the dog, playing in a den and 
 riding bicycles.All had a light midday
 meal, a cooked evening dinner. Sunday 
 afternoons  were  spent  helping      
 gardening, playing or on a computer.  
 All  read  in bed and were asleep by  
 9pm.
