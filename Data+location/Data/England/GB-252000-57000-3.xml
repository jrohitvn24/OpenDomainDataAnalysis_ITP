		<title>03 HOUSE IMPROVEMENT SURVEY</title>
		<content>   Many houses in this area have been  
 modernised,so we surveyed to see what 
 modernisation has been done.          
   We found out that thirty per cent of
 houses have replacement doors.Twenty  
 per cent have had porches built on.   
 Fifteen per cent of people have had   
 some windows replaced in their house, 
 and a further sixteen per cent have   
 had the whole house fitted with new   
 windows.                              
   Only two per cent of people have had
 roof rooms built,maybe because they   
 cost too much.Seven per cent have had 
 extensions on the side or the back    
 of their house.Seven per cent of      
 households have had an extra garage or
 car port.                             
   Twenty four per cent of houses have 
 had their walls painted with water    
 proof paint.Twenty seven per cent have
 been pebble dashed.                   </content>
