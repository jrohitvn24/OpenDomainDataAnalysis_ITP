		<content>   The preservation society was renamed
 'The Isle of Wight Steam Railway      
 Company Ltd' in 1971.  Attractions    
 include a museum, souvenir shop and a 
 place for refreshments.  Renovation is
 now being done by unemployed people   
 under the Youth Training Schene.  This
 gives about a dozen local youngsters  
 work opportunity.  Many original      
 notices and buildings still remain    
 today.  Buildings being built in 1985 
 include a building which will be a    
 larger museum.  A commemoration stone 
 laid by the Lord Lieutenant of the    
 Island marks the start of this        
 project.
