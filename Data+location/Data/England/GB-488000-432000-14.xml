		<title>14BOTHAM'S STORE,NORTH CAVE</title>
		<content>    Thirty years ago, Mr. Botham       
 inherited his father's store which is 
 very old.  Goods were passed across   
 the counter whereas today the store is
 self-service.  On a Monday orders were
 collected and made up and flour was in
 l0 pound bags and sugar was in l00    
 pound bags.   It was ladled out with a
 shiny scoop that fitted on the scales 
 with individual weights.   The bags   
 are all pre-weighed today and costs   
 are calculated on the electric digital
 machine.   During 65 years the coinage
 has changed too which caused them     
 confusion at first.  Earlier for a    
 bill over Â£2.00 you received a        
 dividend stamp.  Today the Bothams    
 sell a much greater variety of food   
 including meat but still prefer the   
 days when Mr. Botham delivered goods  
 by bicycle and people chatted across  
 the counter.                          </content>
