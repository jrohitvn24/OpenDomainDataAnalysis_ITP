 Part of the land is cliff top so it is
 very rocky and difficult to cultivate 
 but the four farmers whose land meets 
 here use it for dairy cattle and      
 grazing.  They all grow grass for hay.
 Three of them grow grass for silage.  
 One farmer manages to grow corn,      
 potatoes, anemones, broccoli and      
 various vegetables as well.  All the  
 farms own machinery including tractors
 but a silage cutter was owned by a    
 syndicate.  The problems for these    
 farmers included  E.E.C. policies,    
 milk quotas, isolation from the rest  
 of the country and the unreliable     
 weather.                              
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
