		<title>15WHAT CORRINGHAM NEEDS</title>
		<content>{ CORRINGHAM TOWN CENTRE}IS USED       
 A LOT.PEOPLE THINK IT IS VERY         
 CONVENIENT,BUT SOME CHILDREN THINK IT 
 COULD BE IMPROVED IN SOME WAYS.       
  MOST OF THE CHILDREN THINK A{YOUTH   
{CLUB}WOULD BE GOOD BECAUSE THERE IS   
 NOTHING FOR THE CHILDREN BETWEEN THE  
 AGES OF 7 AND 13 YEARS.IN THE{YOUTH   
{CLUB}THERE COULD BE SNOOKER TABLES,   
 TABLE TENNIS,DISCOS, AMUSMENTS AND    
 FILMS.YOU SHOULD PAY A FEE AT THE     
 BEGINNING OF THE YEAR AND YOU ARE     
 ALLOWED TO USE ANYTHING FOR THAT YEAR.
  ALSO A{FAST FOOD}SHOP WOULD BE       
 APPRECIATED BECAUCE ALL WE HAVE IN    
 CORRINGHAM TOWN IS A CHINESE AND AN   
 INDIAN RESTAURANT.                    
  WE WOULD LIKE SOME CLEANER{TOILETS   
 BECAUSE THE ONES WE HAVE ARE VERY     
 DIRTY AND HAVE GRAFFITI ON THE WALLS.
