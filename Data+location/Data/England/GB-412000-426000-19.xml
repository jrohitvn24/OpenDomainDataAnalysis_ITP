		<title>19SUBJECTS OF CONCERN IN WYKE</title>
		<content>   Several questions about the future  
 of the area have been raised by local 
 people.  It is hoped that the         
 countryside will remain as it is and  
 not be further developed either       
 agriculturally or for housing or      
 factory sites.  At the same time,     
 unemployment is worrying, but         
 hopefully sufficient infil and        
 redevelopment sites remain to prevent 
 the use of the green areas.           
   Pollution from certain industrial   
 sites is a cause for concern for the  
 health of the local people,           
 particularly for those who live       
 downwind of the prevailing winds.     
   Many old people like living in Wyke,
 but find the area noisy and wish that 
 more buses were available during the  
 day so that waiting around was cut to 
 a minimum.                            
                                       </content>
