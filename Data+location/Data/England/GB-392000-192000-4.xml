		<content>{Crudwell village green}is very        
 attractive.In spring there are        
 snowdrops and daffodils.The rooks are 
 busy building their nests.During the  
 summer the trees make it a cool place 
 to have a picnic.In the Autumn the    
 leaves turn yellow and look really    
 colourful.The green is triangular,    
 near the school and church and        
 enclosed by roads.Parking is not      
 allowed.Around the edges of the green 
 are{18 tall trees}(17{lime}and 1      
 beech) and 9 young lime trees.These   
 were planted in 1984 and have wire    
 fencing around them.Two stone bridges 
 cross the{brook}which runs across the 
 green parallel with the main road.Many
 interesting{water plants and animals  
 are found here.Also on the green are a
{metal bench}which has been there since
 the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II  
 and a{stone milestone.                </content>
