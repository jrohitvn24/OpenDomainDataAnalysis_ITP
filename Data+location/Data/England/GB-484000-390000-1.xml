		<content> The majority of the block, situated to
 the north-east of Gainsborough,       
 consists of mainly agricultural land. 
 To the western edge of the block is a 
 large wood and lake and to the        
 north-east is the hamlet of Aisby.    
 Running from west to east across the  
 southern part of the block is the     
 A631 on which is situated the small   
 village of Corringham.                
 The information on this disc concerns 
 observations on the wood and lake, and
 a study of the settlements and some of
 its inhabitants.
