		<title>19THE MILKMAN.</title>
		<content> My dad delivers milk to people in this
 area. He also delivers eggs and pop,  
 bread and cartons of orange. He       
 delivers these on a Wednesday in the  
 little van. He delivers milk in the   
 big van. He collects the money on     
 Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. He   
 delivers milk,early in the morning,   
 every day except Sunday. He has four  
 milk boys to help him with the milk   
 round. A man called Lester delivers   
 all the milk to the little dairy and  
 my dad picks it up to take to all the 
 people's houses. He looks at the note 
 that people have put in the milk      
 bottles. They say whether they want   
 extra milk or no milk delivered.      
 Sometimes my dad goes to bed in the   
 afternoon for a couple of hours.      
 Sometimes he has to make up the books 
 so he knows how much people owe. My   
 mam helps him to do the books.        </content>
