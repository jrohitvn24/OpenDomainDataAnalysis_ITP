		<title>11A FARM VISIT.</title>
		<content> ON FRIDAY, JULY 8TH, I985 WE VISITED  
 MANOR FARM. MR. BIRD HAS SHEEP AND    
 CATTLE AND HE ALSO BREEDS RABBITS.    
 THEY WERE BLACK AND WHITE RABBITS. THE
 OLDEST WAS ABOUT ONE YEAR OLD AND THE 
 YOUNGEST WAS TWO WEEKS OLD.  THEY ARE 
 SOLD AT MARKET. AT THE MOMENT MR. BIRD
 HAS ABOUT IOO RABBITS. HE WOULD SELL  
 THEM FOR ABOUT Â£2 EACH. RECENTLY THE  
 FARMER HAS BOUGHT A NEW SHEEP DIP. IT 
 IS FIBRE GLASS AND IS FOUR FEET DEEP  
 AND SIX FEET WIDE.  THE FARMER HAS TWO
 COLLIE DOGS TO HELP HIM ROUND UP THE  
 SHEEP. THE SHEEP ARE DIPPED IN LINDANE
 AND MUST BE FULLY COVERED BY IT FOR   
 ONE MINUTE. THE NEW SHEEP DIP HAS A   
 SLIPPERY SURFACE SO THAT THE SHEEP    
 SLIDE IN. MR. BIRD LOVES HIS WORK ON  
 THE FARM BUT HATES DOING THE V.A.T.AND
 THE PEDIGREE RECORDS.                 
                                       
                                       </content>
