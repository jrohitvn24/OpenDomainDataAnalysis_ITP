 Years ago church floors were covered  
 with rushes, which were cleaned out   
 annually.  A Rushbearing Service, to  
 commemorate this tradition, is held at
 St. Stephen's Church (known locally as
 Forest Chapel) every August.  The     
 rushes, grown nearby, are hand cut by 
 local farmers, then plaited and put   
 round the altar, font and doors and   
 intertwined with alternating yellow   
 and orange marigolds.  The service is 
 always very popular and is relayed to 
 those people standing outside.        
                                       
 There are still local farmers who     
 refuse to make hay on Sundays due to  
 their religious beliefs.
