		<content> HOUSING IN ROYTON IS MAINLY TERRACED, 
 SEMI-DETACHED, FLATS OR MAISONETTES.  
 THERE ARE MORE TERRACED HOUSES BECAUSE
 IN THE OLDEN DAYS THEY WERE BUILT FOR 
 THE MILL WORKERS TO LIVE IN.          
 MAISONETTES WERE BUILT LATER BECAUSE  
 THEY TOOK UP LESS SPACE THAN TERRACED 
 HOUSES. SEMI-DETACHED MEANS TWO HOUSES
 JOINED TOGETHER. THEY NORMALLY HAVE   
 QUITE BIG GARDENS. FLATS ARE BUILT ON 
 TOP OF ONE ANOTHER TO SAVE SPACE. THE 
 HIGHER THEY ARE THE MORE ROOM THEY    
 SAVE. THERE ARE TWO TYPES OF          
 MAISONETTES. ONE OF THEM IS A HOUSE AT
 THE BOTTOM AND A FLAT AT THE TOP. THE 
 OTHER IS THE OTHER WAY ROUND.
