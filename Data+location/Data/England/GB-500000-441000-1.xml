		<content>      Leconfield (Lachinfeld)          
 Pronounced lek-on-field.              
      This small village is mentioned  
 in the 'Domesday book of 1086' listed 
 under Yorkshire its Ridings,          
 Wapentakes and Hundreds,the Archbishop
 of York-West Treding (Riding).        
      The entry continues "St John has 
 two bovates of land, this is a        
 berewick of Beverley (Bevreli)". This 
 small entry does not do justice to a  
 peacful area such as this, the only   
 major problem being that of the main  
 road from Beverley to Driffield       
 passing through.                      
      The main landcover is the village
 itself, the airfield and the rest is  
 farmland. The village has a population
 of approximately 2000 whom mainly now 
 live in homes recently (within 20     
 years) built. (Continued)
