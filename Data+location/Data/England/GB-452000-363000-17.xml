		<title>17Leisure Activity (Cont.)</title>
		<content> There are many courses around with    
 humps and jumps but they are quite    
 dangerous.On the bike itself there are
 three safety pads to prevent injury.  
 Different parts can be changed like   
 the seat,brakes,frame,handlebars and  
 wheels.Instead of doing stunts you can
 do simple riding around the streets.
