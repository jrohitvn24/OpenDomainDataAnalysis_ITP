		<content>  Dad wakes me up running his bath."Oh 
 no", Ithink,"It's Thursday-{school}is 
 the dreaded word.Seven o'clock already
 and my sister is reading.I pick up my 
 book but fall asleep again." Come on, 
 Sarah " my Mum calls . I get up and   
 get dressed but everyone else has     
 finished their breakfast. I do the    
 washing up and at 8.15 my sister goes 
 off to catch the bus to her school.I  
 have to walk to mine and leave 30     
 minutes later.                        
  Hurrah! It's 3.10,we go home.At 3.30 
 my brother and I go to the Hillier's  
 farm for{Riding}, often playing with  
 their puppies when we get             
 back.Next-tea! At 6.30 I get changed  
 to go into Malmesbury to do land drill
 that's running and circuit training in
 connection with The{Marlin's Swimming 
{Club}. By 8.30 it's home to bed.
