		<title>12A DAY IN THE LIFE OF PERCY</title>
		<content>  Percy Stone, aged 75, is Pangbourne's
 miller and corn merchant. He has lived
 in the Mill House all his life and    
 still goes to work at 7.30 a.m. He    
 packs flour and yeast to sell to the  
 customers in his shop in the High     
 Street. He goes home for lunch between
 1.00 and 2.00p.m., returns to work and
 finishes for the day around 5.00pm.   
 His wife is 72 and is a housewife. She
 does voluntary work for Oxfam and the 
 National Trust. They have four married
 children and eleven grandchildren.    
 Their hobbies include visiting        
 National Trust houses, visiting       
 exhibitions and watching the news,    
 plays and travel programmes on TV. A  
 book about Percy's grandfather{'Robert
{-  Stone Miller of Pangbourne'}was    
 published in 1980. It consists of his 
 diary and reveals a great deal about  
 life between 1169 and 1882.           </content>
