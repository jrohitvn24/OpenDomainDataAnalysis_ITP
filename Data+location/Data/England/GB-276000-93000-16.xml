		<title>16Life at New Haldon Farm</title>
		<content> I live at New Haldon Farm and it is   
 quite big being 71 acres including    
 woodland. We are trying to buy more   
 land otherwise we are going to be     
 overloaded with sheep. We have about  
 250 sheep. We lamb in a big shed. For 
 indoor lambing we bring the sheep in  
 during November and we lamb in        
 December. This is our first batch. Our
 second batch is in March. We always   
 shear our sheep in the winter. There  
 is a disease called ecolia. It is a   
 disease which lambs get if you don't  
 give them pills when they are born. My
 Mum and I know when they have got it  
 when they start frothing at the mouth 
 and get stiff. You cannot save them   
 at all. We have cows and we rear      
 calves from them.
