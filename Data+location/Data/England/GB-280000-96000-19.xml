		<content> Then we went to see where the dairy   
 cows (Freisian herd) were milked.It is
 like a large shed and is called the   
 Milking Parlour.Each cow has its own  
 compartment and there are about 16    
 cows milked at a time.The cows are    
 machine milked twice a day - at about 
 8 o'clock in the morning and 5.30 in  
 the evening.A huge milk tanker        
 collects milk from the farm at 8.30am.
 There is a vacuum pump to milk the    
 cows,the milk flows through stainless 
 steel pipes through to a huge tank in 
 the dairy.The milk is kept cool and on
 ice to keep it fresh.The tank holds   
 about 900 litres. Inside the tank     
 there is a winder that turns every 2  
 hours for 3 minutes to keep the fat   
 from settling.Once the milk is removed
 the tank,pipes and equipment are all  
 thoroughly washed and sterilised ready
 for next time.                        </content>
