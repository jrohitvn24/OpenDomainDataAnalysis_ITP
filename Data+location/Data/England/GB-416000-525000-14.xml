		<content>{OLD SCHOOL_ST.HELEN'S AUCKLAND PRIMARY
{as seen by Michael Robinson,age 10.   
 The school was built in 1910 and is 75
 years old.It is made from red brick   
 and blue-grey roof tiles.There are 14 
 classrooms,a large hall and a small   
 hall in the main building.Although the
 school is very old-fashioned,new parts
 have been added such as toilets, kit- 
 chen,and staffroom,and a nursery has  
 been built separate from the school.  
 All the new parts have flat roofs.    
 The decoration is very poor,especially
 where the roof has leaked.            
 There is a playground and a field.    
 A busy main road runs past the school.
