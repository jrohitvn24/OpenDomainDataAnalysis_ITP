		<title>17CRADLEY SINCE 1949</title>
		<content> In 1949 Cradley was a rural village.  
 Most of the people worked on farms.   
 There was no electricity,no mains     
 water or drainage.People used oil     
 lamps and a man used to do a paraffin 
 round once a week.The water came from 
 a well and to get enough water up to a
 tank in the roof you had to do at     
 least 1000 pumps a day.The sewage was 
 collected in a cess pit in the garden 
 Many hops were grown and in September 
 lots of hop pickers used to come from 
 all over in horse drawn wagons.The    
 doctor had to make all his own        
 medicines,and since the NHS in 1948 he
 was very busy.Aspirins were a great   
 help in medical services. The roads   
 were very dusty and every time a lorry
 went by,houses got covered in dust.The
 Bosbury road was very busy because    
 lorries used to come through from     
 Wales taking a short cut to Birmingham</content>
