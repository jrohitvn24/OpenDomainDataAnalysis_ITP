		<content> The Frogmill has always been most     
 popular with the local villagers of   
 Shipton .In the early 1980's on Whit  
 Tuesday the local branch of the       
 Ancient Order of Foresters held their 
 parade beginning with a service in St 
 Oswalds ,the parish church and then   
 marching in full regalia with flags   
 flying,to the Frogmill Inn for dinner 
 in the big club room.Afterwards there 
 was all the fun of the fair.For the   
 children,the excitement of swings,    
 coconut shies and stalls by the       
 roadside,and the fun of having a      
 monkey on a stick.One of the local    
 vicars even composed a hymn called"The
 Foresters Hymn"which was sung only on 
 this occasion.The first verse began:- 
          "Hear the call any brothers  
          Quiet yourseves like men-    
          Tell the word to others      
          All be brothers then."       </content>
