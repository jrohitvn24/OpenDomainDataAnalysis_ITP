		<title>10A Day In My Life.</title>
		<content> My name is Carla Holz, I am eleven    
 years old and have lived in Snailbeach
 for ten years. I wake up about 8 a.m.,
 wash and dress and at about 8.15 I    
 make breakfast. I usually have Coco   
 Pops. I have three sisters and two    
 brothers. Nicola leaves for school at 
 8.30. Then I do my hair. I leave for  
 the bus stop at about nine o clock. We
 reach school around quarter past nine.
 When we arrive we read. In the morning
 we do maths and language work. In the 
 afternoon we have story and we then do
 project work. The bus collects us at  
 half past three and I get home about  
 quarter to four. Nicola arrives about 
 quarter past four. Adrian, my brother,
 is having exams and goes to school for
 only three days a week. I usually do  
 some jobs for mum then  go for a walk.
 Sometimes I watch T.V. I go to bed at 
 about 8.30 and read till 9.00.        </content>
