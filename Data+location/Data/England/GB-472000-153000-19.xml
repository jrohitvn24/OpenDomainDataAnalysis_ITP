		<title>19NEW PLANS FOR HOOK SCHOOL</title>
		<content> Changes have been announced in plans  
 for joining Hook Junior and Infants'  
 Schools into one building.Estimated   
 cost by Hampshire County Architect's  
 Department was Â£700 000 but the lowest
 tender received was for Â£1.1million.As
 this was unacceptable the architects  
 and a firm of contractors are looking 
 at ways of pruning Â£400 000 from the  
 conversion cost.The school governors  
 think that,despite the alterations,   
 the money will still provide adequate 
 accomodation. Last term,in addition to
 rooms in the main block, there were   
 five hutted classrooms which have been
 constructed in the past few years to  
 house rapidly rising numbers. Further 
 temporary rooms were added during the 
 summer as several classes will need to
 be relocated during the building work,
 expected to commence in January 1986.
