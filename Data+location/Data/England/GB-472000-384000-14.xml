		<content> ONCE THE CROP IS READY,A TIME WHICH   
 MAY BE FROM EARLY JUNE TO LATE JULY   
 DEPENDING ON THE WEATHER,TEAMS OF     
 PICKERS SPEND MOST OF THE DAY IN THE  
 FIELDS. THIS WILL ENSURE THAT THE CROP
 IS SELECTED AT ITS BEST.              
 ALTHOUGH THERE ARE MANY SMALLHOLDINGS 
 WHICH PRODUCE THE CROP,IN RECENT YEARS
 SOME LARGER AREAS HAVE BEEN UTILISED  
 IN AN ATTEMPT TO PRODUCE A BETTER     
 CROP.ONE FAMILY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO     
 NEGOTIATE TO SUPPLY A NATIONAL CHAIN  
 STORE GROUP AND THIS HAS RESULTED IN A
 MORE SCIENTIFIC METHOD OF PICKING AND 
 PACKAGING.THE CROP IS PICKED,THE      
 TEMPERATURE OF THE FRUIT IS           
 REDUCED,IT IS PACKAGED AND THEN THE   
 TEMPERATURE IS LOWERED STILL FURTHER. 
 THE FRUIT IS THEN COLLECTED AND TAKEN 
 AWAY FOR SALE.
