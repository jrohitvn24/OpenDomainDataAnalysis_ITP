		<content>   The south west corner of the area is
 occupied by an{ammunition factory,}   
 Royal Ordnance PLC, which was built   
 during the Second World War and has   
 recently been privatised. An old      
{timber framed building,}Buckshaw Hall,
 is within the factory grounds and so  
 is inaccessible to the public.        
 Negotiations are taking place with a  
 view to moving the hall to a new site,
 possibly in the grounds of Euxton     
 Hall, about four kilometres south of  
 its present site.                     
   Old{cotton mills}in Whittle-le-Woods
 are now being used mainly by small    
 metal-working firms.                  
                                       
  {Traffic congestion}on the A6 through
 Whittle-le-Woods has been relieved by 
 the opening of a new link road to the 
 M61 at Walton Summit three kilometres 
 north of the village.                 </content>
