		<title>01Keinton Mandeville and Area</title>
		<content> The small Somerset village of Keinton 
 Mandeville lies in an area of gently  
 rolling hills. The soils are heavy and
 mixed farming predominates with the   
 emphasis on arable. The school        
 boarding house at Kingweston is an    
 important feature of the block and of 
 the wider local area. Most of the     
 population commute into nearby Yeovil 
 for work, as few are employed on the  
 land or in providing local services.  
 If more services are needed, Somerton 
 or Yeovil have to be reached.         
 Therefore car ownership is high. The  
 stone quarries to the north of Keinton
 Mandeville, although disused, were the
 source of building stone, for a large 
 number of local buildings. The block  
 has small villages set against an     
 agricultural background.
