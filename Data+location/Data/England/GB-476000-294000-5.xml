		<title>05HALLATON SHOPPING FACILITIES</title>
		<content> The only shop in the three villages is
 the{Hallaton Store and Post Office,}an
 important focus of village life. It   
 stocks most household needs, and many 
 villagers do a substantial part of    
 their weekly shopping there. Prices   
 and limited choice, however, result in
 other people shopping mostly in Market
 Harborough, Uppingham, Leicester or   
 Corby. The village shop is a meeting  
 place and gives opportunity, particu- 
 larly to the elderly, for a walk      
 around the village. Once there were 19
 shops in Hallaton: the only other     
 remaining now is an{Antiques Shop}next
 to the Post Office, which just opens  
 on Sunday afternoons. In addition,    
 there is a visiting greengrocer on    
 Thursdays, a bread van three days a   
 week, and a fish and chip van on      
 Thursday evening. A doctor is at Torch
 House twice a week for consultation.  </content>
