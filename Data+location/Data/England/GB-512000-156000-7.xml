		<content> Rowhurst Forge was built in 1950 of   
 old materials to match the adjacent   
 Tudor farmhouse. Most of the work is  
 done in mild steel which is obtained  
 from the British Steel Industry but   
 when they are on strike it is imported
 from Sweden. A few items are made in  
 stainless steel which is more         
 expensive. A lot of this work is      
 exported to Saudi Arabia for the Sheik
 Of Oman's palace. The forge, which    
 employs 20 people, is a member of the 
 crafts council. Blacksmiths train for 
 5 yrs working a 37.5 hour week.       
 At the forge there is an exhibition   
 gallery where work from all over the  
 world is on show. The 10 acres of     
 land, which belong to the forge, are  
 divided by the M25 motorway.          
 The present owners are Mr and Mrs     
 Quinnell.
