		<title>18GOBOWEN FOOTBALL CLUB</title>
		<content> The disbandment of{Gobowen Football   
{Club}due to lack of interest was for  
 one man,{Cyril Mottram,}a bitter      
 disappointment. For those who have    
 been associated with the club for the 
 last 40 years will know that he       
 devoted his life to it as             
 secretary,player,groundsman,trainer   
 and goodness knows what else.You might
 ask why he did this.The answer is     
 simple.It is because he loves the game
 and he enjoys helping other people to 
 enjoy themselves.                     
     Cyril's one ambition was to win   
 the{Shropshire Junior Cup,}and this he
 achieved when Gobowen triumphed in the
 final at the Gay Meadow,Shrewsbury,in 
 the early seventies. He deserves the  
 freedom of Gobowen for his services to
 young people and his commitment to the
 community in general.
