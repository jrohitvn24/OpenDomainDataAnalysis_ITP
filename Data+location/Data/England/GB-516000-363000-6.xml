 The village of{Stixwould}lies about   
 two miles to the north of Woodhall    
 Spa.It's population has dropped by    
 about 25% since 1935 and in 1985 stood
 at 124.                               
 There are not any shops nor are there 
 any scheduled buses apart from the    
 school bus that goes to Tattershall   
 and Horncastle.There is a caravan site
 near to the village duck pond.Many    
 kinds of duck can be found on the     
 pond.                                 
 The village church is called          
 St.Peter's                            
 and every year on St.Peter's Day gifts
 are presented.Some of the graves in   
 the churchyard are very old.
