		<title>12Foxlease House</title>
		<content> Foxlease House is a 400 year old Manor
 House bought by Sir Philip            
 Jennings-Clark in A.D.1500.   Three   
 rooms were added by the Adams Bros. in
 1775 and are decorated in magnificent 
 Regency style.   When the house became
 a Girl Guide Training Centre, they    
 named these three rooms Scotland,     
 Hampshire, and London.                
  Scotland was the most ornately       
 decorated, finished in gold leaf, with
 a large crystal chandelier hanging    
 from the ceiling.The house has a total
 of 56 rooms including a chapel.       
 Foxlease became a Guide Training      
 Headquarters in 1922.   Brownies and  
 Guides each donated 1 penny and the   
 viewing of Princess Mary's wedding    
 presents raised Â£6 000.   But this was
 not enough and the house was          
 eventually given to the Girl Guides   
 Association.                          </content>
