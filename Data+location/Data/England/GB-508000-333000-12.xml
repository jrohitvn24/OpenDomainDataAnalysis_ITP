		<content>  As the largest proportion of the     
 block is arable land, ecology takes on
 an important role in the life of the  
 countryside. The main crops are       
 cereals so the farmers feel that they 
 must spray with insecticides to       
 protect their crops from pests.       
 Unfortunately along with the pests    
 other valuable creatures such as bees 
 are also destroyed. Birds also suffer 
 when they eat contaminated insects and
 our hedgerows and roadside verges are 
 depleted of wildlife.                 
  Fish and other aquatic life suffer   
 when the water becomes polluted       
 through drainage from the fields.     
  Some farmers are now realising the   
 extent of the problem and trying to   
 improve matters.
