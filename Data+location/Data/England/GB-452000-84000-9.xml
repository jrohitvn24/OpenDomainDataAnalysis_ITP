		<title>09ARRETON MANOR, ARRETON</title>
		<content>      Arreton Manor is the home of     
 Claus Schroeder and is open to the    
 public. It is a popular tourist       
 attraction on the Isle of Wight.      
  It is listed as a building of special
 architectural and historic merit.  The
 Manor House is pleasantly situated in 
 rural surroundings sited comfortably  
 at the foot of Arreton down.          
      There has been a Manor House on  
 the site since its mention in the     
 domesday book of 1086.  It was rebuilt
 during 1595-1612 but retained part of 
 a 14th century building.              
      The Manor House is typically late
 Elizabethan-early Jacobean with two   
 projecting wings and a central porch. 
      The various rooms which the      
 visitor sees, with the exception of   
 the library, are furnished with late  
 Elizabethan and early to late 17th    
 century pieces.                       </content>
