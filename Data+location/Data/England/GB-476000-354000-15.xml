		<title>15FARMING AT MR. LATHAMS</title>
		<content> On Mr.Latham's farm the permanent     
 pasture is near to Flash Farm because 
 this where the milking parlour is     
 placed.The cattle therefore do not    
 have far to walk from the fields to   
 get milked.                           
 The barley is grown in three areas,all
 of which are close to School Farm,    
 where barley is dried and stored.The  
 oil seed rape fields are all close    
 together.This makes it easier to      
 harvest and also stops it spreading   
 into other crops.Potatoes have been   
 planted in fields that are of a       
 certain size to enable the machines to
 harvest them more easily and other    
 vehicles to spray the crops more      
 conveniently.Certain fields have a    
 particular crop because of the cash   
 value of the crops and due to crop    
 rotation.                             
                                       </content>
