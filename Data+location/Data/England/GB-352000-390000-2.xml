		<title>02MORE ABOUT CLOCK FACE</title>
		<content>     Clock Face has a small shopping   
 area which is situated near the Clock 
 Face Bridge.  There is also a small   
 factory which makes 'Clock Face       
 Crisps'. There is a hotel called the  
 'Clock Face Hotel' which was first    
 opened in 1775.  Clock Face has one   
 main road through the area from which 
 many side roads run.  This main road  
 runs into beautiful countryside.  This
 road is a very busy road because it is
 the main road to Warrington.          
    There are many amenities in Clock  
 Face such as playing areas, a football
 ground that may be used by any local  
 team and a cricket ground.  There are 
 also tennis courts.  From Clock Face  
 we can see several different views.   
 From one side we can see the Sutton   
 Manor Colliery pit-head and from      
 another farmers' fields and from      
 another Bold Power Station.           </content>
