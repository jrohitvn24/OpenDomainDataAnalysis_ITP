		<title>05The Needlework At Notgrove</title>
		<content> The Needlework in St. Bartholomews    
 Church is an unique example of modern 
 craftsmanship worked in Cross and Tent
 stitch. It covers the blank East wall 
 of the Church, replacing the 14th     
 century rerodos destroyed in the      
 Reformation. The Needlework was       
 designed by Colin Skelton Anderson of 
 Notgrove Manor taking 11 years to     
 complete, being finished in 1954. It  
 shows a summer scene in bright colours
 with the village on the right of the  
 Church and the Manor on the left. The 
 whole is surrounded by a twisting     
 scroll of Hazel leaves and nuts. The  
 initials of all the principal workers 
 are included in the frieze. Several   
 members of the Anderson family worked 
 on the Needlework helped by friends in
 the village.
