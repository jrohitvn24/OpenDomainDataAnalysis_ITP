		<content> We visited Astley Bridge Cricket Club 
 where we spoke to one of the          
 groundsmen. He told us about a lot of 
 things which had happened there. We   
 found out that there had been two     
 fires on the cricket ground. In one of
 the fires two guard dogs were         
 killed.The first fire was in the early
 1960's.Now they are trying to get a   
 number of social events organised for 
 the Astley Bridge Community like a    
 domino club for old age pensioners on 
 Wednesday afternoons.He told us about 
 the special event in August.In August 
 1985 they are building a temporary    
 stage on the ground.All the operatic  
 societies of Astley Bridge are going  
 to be performing on it and there will 
 be floodlights.They are going to call 
 it Son et Lumiere and that means sound
 and light.
