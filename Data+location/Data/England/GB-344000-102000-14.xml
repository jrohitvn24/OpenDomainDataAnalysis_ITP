 about 30% of the homes in this area   
 are occupied mostly by retired people.
 they play golf, tend their gardens,   
 enjoy coach trips to nearby areas,    
 though many become withdrawn.A mordern
 semi_detached bungalow costs about    
 Â£35,000. Older houses;_ many dating   
 from 17th century, several thatched_  
 inhabited by retired people who have  
 lived and worked in the area all their
 lives _ many of these homes are       
 neglected and in need of repair. Some 
 of the older homes are occupied by    
 people who have moved to the west     
 country from  London and the north as 
 a preferable place to live and        
 work.Some are occupied as holiday     
 homes for use only during a few weeks 
 of the year.The price of these older  
 properties reflects the demand and    
 they are becoming very expensive.     </content>
