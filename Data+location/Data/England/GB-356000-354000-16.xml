		<title>16EMPLOYMENT IN HAUGHTON AREA</title>
		<content> Being a rural area, large scale       
 employers are virtually non-existant, 
 there are , however, many small groups
 and these together keep a large number
 of people employed. Farming is the    
 main area of employment in the area,  
 and takes many forms. From the small  
 family farm with father, son and per- 
 haps the farmers wife part-time, to   
 the large managed farms which contract
 outside labour and machinery. Many    
 farms previously employing staff have 
 been penalised by the milk quotas and 
 cannot afford to maintain previous    
 staff levels, so these have also      
 become family concerns where long     
 hours are worked to compensate for    
 staff shortages. We have two haulage  
 businesses locally - both family con- 
 cerns. Apart from heavy long distance 
 haulage, one firm also contracts to do
 light haulage on a local basis.       </content>
