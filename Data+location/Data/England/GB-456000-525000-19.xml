		<title>19Schooldays in Coatham 1905</title>
		<content> Mrs Tate came to Redcar in 1905 at the
 age of 7 and is still alive today. She
 lived in West Coatham, which is now a 
 part of I.C.I works. She had to walk  
 over the fields and marshes to get to 
 school which took her 45 minutes. The 
 school was Coatham School which is now
 a Youth Training Centre.              
 There were no lunches provided at     
 school so the pupils had to bring     
 their own. They didn't bring drinks as
 there was a tap and an iron cup in the
 yard for the children. The school     
 closed at lunchtime so the pupils went
 to the beach or playground. Some girls
 went to the teacher's house to sew    
 sheets. This was thought of as an     
 honour.                               
 Being a Church school there was an    
 assembly at the start and finish of   
 every day and grace was said at the   
 end of morning and afternoon school.  </content>
