		<title>07CROSSMAN'S FARM, WITHYCOMBE</title>
		<content> Steve Crossman has the Withycombe farm
 which is right in the centre of the   
 village.  It is an intensive pig farm 
 and the fields are given over entirely
 to the production of feed for the     
 pigs.  The farm also buys in pig feed 
 and stores it in a large barn.        
                                       
 It is interesting to note that both   
 Crossman's farm and Binham Manor farm 
 are now producing one major product   
 whereas not so many years ago they    
 would have been mixed farms relying on
 a number of different products.
