		<title>10A Small Farm in Water</title>
		<content> Waterhouse Farm, a typical small      
 holding, was built in 1700,with       
 additional buildings added up to 1976.
 The farm had once been very large and 
 would have supported one or two       
 families, but typical of many farms   
 in the area, large parcels of land    
 have been sold leaving 6 acres of     
 rough grazing and hay meadow.         
     The farm at present is unable to  
 support a family. There are 8 cattle, 
 11 hens,one cock and two goats all    
 looked after as a hobby rather than   
 for economic returns.                 
     The farmhouse is in the process of
 renovation as are many in the area.   
 Composed of stone with a new tile roof
 the farmhouse commands a SSE position 
 and has good access to the village and
 excellant views. Main water is        
 available to the house as well as     
 spring water.                         </content>
