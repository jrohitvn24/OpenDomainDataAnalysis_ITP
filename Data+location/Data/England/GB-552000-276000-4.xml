		<content> The climate of the area is a type of  
 'continental climate'. Rainfall which 
 is about 550 - 650mm (22 - 24 inches) 
 is evenly distributed throughout the  
 year. Summer temperatures reach 18'C  
 with some long warm, dry spells being 
 commonplace. Winter temperatures      
 average out at 4'C with many days of  
 frost but only a few days of standing 
 snow. Winds are sometimes a problem   
 over this flat landscape especially in
 March and April when the ground has   
 dried out and the new crops have not  
 grown very much. In extreme cases     
 severe erosion can occur with much    
 hardship and loss of money for the    
 farmers.
