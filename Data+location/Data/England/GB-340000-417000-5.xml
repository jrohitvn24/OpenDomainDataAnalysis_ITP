		<content> Holmes is a quiet place with no shops 
 , schools , playing fields , high     
 hills but there is one chapel and a   
 sewage treatment works.               
    There are about 130 people living  
 in the area in 46 houses , 10 farms , 
 7 market gardens and 4 other          
 businesses , a produce merchant ,     
 garage for repairs but no petrol ,    
 joiner and haulage firm. The farms are
 all well over 100 years old. The      
 houses are a mixture , 9 are under 30 
 years old and 20 houses over 30 years 
 old and 3 uninhabited.                
    Children under 11 go to the C of E 
 school in Merebrow. Over 11 years the 
 children go to Tarleton High school.  
 There are no shops but delivery vans  
 come into the area. If they want      
 bigger things the people go to        
 Southport or Preston.
