		<content> THE JUNIOR SCHOOL EXPERIENCE OF       
    CLAIRE DEGUILE AGED TWELVE.        
                                       
 AT MY JUNIOR SCHOOL WE HAD FOUR       
 HOUSES,NORMANS,SAXONS,ROMANS,AND      
 DANES.WE WERE ALL PUT INTO HOUSES IN  
 THE FIRST YEAR.THE SCHOOL WAS VERY    
 SMALL AND EVERYBODY KNEW EVERYBODY    
 REALLY WELL.WE HAD A DAY WHERE SOME   
 FOURTH YEAR GIRLS AND BOYS WERE       
 ELECTED TO GO OUT OF THE ROOM,WHILE   
 THE OTHERS VOTED TO SEE WHO WOULD     
 BECOME HOUSE AND SPORTS CAPTAINS OF   
 NORMANS.LAST TERM BEFORE I LEFT,IT WAS
 OUR TURN,AND LEIGH-ANN SCOTT,KERRI    
 DEVALL AND MYSELF WERE NOMINATED.I WAS
 LUCKY AND WAS VOTED THE CAPTAIN OF THE
 HOUSE.THIS WAS A VERY IMPORTANT JOB   
 FOR ME,AND I WAS VERY BUSY AS A RESULT
 OF IT,ESPECIALLY HELPING THE SPORTS   
 CAPTAIN ON SPORTS DAY.UNFORTUNATELY,  
 NORMANS ONLY CAME SECOND.             </content>
