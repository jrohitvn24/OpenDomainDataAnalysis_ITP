The font is a small octagonal shaped   
vase of stone and it sits on a         
pedestal.  On the right side there are 
three family pews which were for the   
families of Tattenhoe Hall, Howe Park  
and Tattenhoe Bare Farm.  On the left  
there are plain straight backed pews.  
The church holds 60 people.  When we   
went to the little church we felt that 
it was a mysterious place.  What has   
happenedto the people who must have    
once lived by the church?  No one      
knows.  History shows that Roman       
Soldiers stayed in these parts.        
Services are held in this lonely little
church during the summer.  Tattenhoe is
one parish that the Rector of Newton   
Lonville looks after.   To visit the   
chuh you must be prepared to make your 
way up a long rutted track.
