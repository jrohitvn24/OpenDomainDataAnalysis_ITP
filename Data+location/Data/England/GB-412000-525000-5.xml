		<content> Within our area of study there are    
 several religious denominations.We    
 went out into the area,did a count of 
 the various places of worship.We found
 that in the largest settlement,       
{Evenwood},there were{4 places}of      
 worship.One was the local{Church of   
{England}called{St.Pauls}.There was    
 also a{Pentecostal}Church in the      
 village plus a{Methodist Chapel}and   
 also a{United Reformed}Church.In      
{Ramshaw}we found a Methodist Chapel   
 and in{High Lands}a{Weslyan}Chapel.   
 There was an old church in{Morley}but 
 it was no longer in use as a church   
 and has not been so for many many     
 years.It appeared very derelict and   
 seemed to be used as a cow byre       
 nowadays.The thng we did notice was   
 that within our whole area there was  
 no place of worship for{Roman         
{Catholics}.                           </content>
