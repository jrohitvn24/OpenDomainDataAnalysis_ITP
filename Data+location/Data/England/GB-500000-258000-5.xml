		<content> The land use of the square is         
 predominantly agricultural.           
 This is a mixed farming area.         
 The most common type of farm is arable
 mostly cereals and rape,but there are 
 also significant numbers of livestock 
 both dairy and beef cattle as well as 
 sheep.To this extent the area is      
 unusual for a County in which arable  
 farming predominates.                 
 Close to the river in the west of the 
 square,there are well established     
 hedgerows and the fields are smaller  
 than in the eastern section.          
 There has been considerable           
 mechanisation and de-manning in recent
 years.All basic crop growing          
 cultivation and harvesting is now done
 by machine.The one exception to this  
 in the square is to be found on the   
 market garden land close to Sharnbrook
 turn off the A6.                      </content>
