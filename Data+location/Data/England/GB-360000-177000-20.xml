		<content>   Our community comprises all age     
 groups. Some of the large houses are  
 nursing and retirement homes so there 
 are many elderly people. People aged  
 between 20 and 60 work in three main  
 areas: the Hospital; in education in  
 surrounding schools or the nearby     
 Polytechnic, or in business concerns. 
    The{Village Hall}run by a voluntary
 Management Committee is the focal     
 point of leisure activities.  There   
 are two clubs for the elderly plus one
 for retired men, two Womens           
 Institutes, and active Scout and Guide
 Associations. There is also a Youth   
 Group and a Playgroup and Toddler     
 group for pre-school children.        
   The {Village School}has 82 children 
 aged from four to eleven. Children go 
 to school from 09.00 to 15.45 on five 
 days a week for 38 weeks of the year.
