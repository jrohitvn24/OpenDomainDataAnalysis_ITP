		<content> In a typical class of 20 children     
 aged about 9, we found these animals  
 kept as pets:                         
                                       
             9  dogs                   
             5  cats                   
             1  tortoise               
             4  birds                  
             21 fish                   
             13 rabbits                
             2  newts                  
             3  frogs                  
             2  gerbils                
                                       
    Some of the pets belonged to the   
 children personally, and they were    
 expected to feed, clean and care for  
 the animals. Others were family pets, 
 and all the family helped to care for 
 them. Most children agreed that their 
 Mum spent a lot of time caring for    
 their pets.                           </content>
