 One day me,Claire,my dad,Claire's dad,
 Simon,Shane and Mark went down to     
 Tregardock.My dad took his car and    
 Claire's dad took his car.We parked in
 a farm lane.We went down through three
 fields and went down the cliff by some
 steps.We went down to the sand and    
 made sand castles.We were looking     
 around and running and jumping.We had 
 a good time.                          
      On the way up we looked back     
 at the beach.
