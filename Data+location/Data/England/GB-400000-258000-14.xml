		<title>14CONSERVATION OF FECKENHAM</title>
		<content> There is a 28 acres conservation area,
 classified as a site of special       
 scientific interest, called Feckenham 
 Wylde Moor.  It is owned by the Worcs.
 Nature Conservation Trust and was     
 purchased in 1981 with the aid of     
 grants and donations from interested  
 parties.  The site is of particular   
 interest to conservationists because  
 it is the remains of an extensive     
 marsh which flooded due to blocked    
 drainage from Brandon Brook and       
 reverted to wetland conditions.  The  
 land had been drained and farmed from 
 the mid 19th century but was of no    
 agricultural use for crops. It was    
 used for grazing.  A large pool was   
 excavated in 1982 and a number of     
 smaller pools have been planned in    
 order that the wet area be maintained.
 It is envisaged that aquatic species  
 will be encouraged.                   </content>
