		<title>19THE HARLOW ADVICE BUREAU .</title>
		<content> The{Advice Bureau}was built 7 years   
 ago.About{53,000}people are helped    
 every year,with every kind of problem 
 ranging from{Legal to Consumer.}      
 Ten people are employed, one person is
 paid,the others are volunteers.Often  
 people come in as a last resort ;     
 others come straight away,to find help
 with their problems.Sometimes people  
 will tell of their problems standing  
 at the desk,some will not say anything
 and prefer privacy.Once the Advice    
 Centre was visited by a group of skin 
 heads (hooligans) from outside Harlow 
 asking to meet Harlow's skin          
 heads.When they had gone{Mrs Sursbury 
{(superviser)}saw that the collecting  
 box had gone! Later on one skin head  
 came back to return the money.        
 Much information is published on      
 posters and leaflets for distribution.
