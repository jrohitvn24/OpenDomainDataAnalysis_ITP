		<title>09LIFE IN THE ROBOROUGH AREA</title>
		<content> I like living in this area because    
 it is peaceful.                       
 I like it because we have lots  of    
 woods and moorland.                   
 I like it because we have open fields 
 to play in.                           
 I like it because I can walk out of   
 my garden into a park and then down to
 a stream.                             
 Then up the hill there is a farm with 
 geese,roosters,chicks and a donkey.   
 We often go down to the woods to make 
 tree dens and find flowers.           
 I like our school because we have got 
 lots of big trees round it and it is  
 very pretty.We also have a big field  
 to play in.                           
 I like living here because we have a  
 good play park near us.               
 I think I would rather live here than 
 anywhere else.This area is so nice I  
 would not want to move away.          </content>
