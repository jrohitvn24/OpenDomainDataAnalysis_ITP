		<title>12Larches House</title>
		<content> Larches House was built in 1837 as the
 private home of a local mill owner.The
 most prominent citizen to own it was  
 Edmund Birley,the Guild Mayor of 1882 
 and Lord Lieutenant of Lancashire.    
 In 1939 the house was requisitioned by
 the Army as a Military Police H.Q.    
 After the war in 1946 it was sold to  
 Preston Corporation who used the  land
 to build the Larches housing estate   
 and the house as a Childrens Home.    
  Today the house is used  as a Special
 Residential School for about 30       
 children aged between 6-16 with       
 learning and emotional difficulties.  
 There is also ,a day unit for about 8 
 Phobic children who are unable to face
 normal schools ,and an office for the 
 local Educational Psychologists.
