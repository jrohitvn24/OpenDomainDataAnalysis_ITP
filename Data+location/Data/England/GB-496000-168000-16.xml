		<content> Pastel colours are in fashion this    
 year.You can see that miniskirts are  
 also Fashionable.Boys wear mostly     
 Kikku jeans which are not wide at the 
 bottom.Adidas sweatshirts can have    
 long sleeves and short sleeves.Lyle   
 and Scott and Pringle jumpers are made
 of wool with either a plain or patter-
 ned design which are very expensive,  
 the brand name being the fashion.     
 A Bob haircut is shaped at the back   
 cut so that it curls under.The fringe 
 is flicked slightly at the side.To    
 'flick',the hair is brushed back,but  
 is not held by anything. Perms are a  
 treatment for your hair,the affects   
 can make it either curly or just wavy.
 Layering is a style of cutting hair,  
 making it 'flicked'.You can highlight 
 your hair making your hair have       
 Blonde streaks.Or Dye it Blonde,      
 Brown,Ginger or even Purple!          </content>
