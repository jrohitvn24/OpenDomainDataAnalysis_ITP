		<title>17CHANGES IN CAISTOR SCHOOLS 2</title>
		<content>  Opinion (see page 16)became polarised
 into two 'camps';one group supporting 
 the creation of a{comprehensive       
 school(which had the backing of the   
 local Labour Party);the other         
 preferring the retention of a         
 selective{grammar school}and therefore
 supporting the 'closer cooperation'   
 option.Leaflets from both campaigns   
 were distributed door to door, letters
 were written to the Education         
 Committee, councillers and Members of 
 Parliament.                           
  The Education Committee eventually   
 decided to retain the selective       
 grammar school(the Caistor area is one
 of the few areas in the country to    
 have selective education),but with    
 closer cooperation with the Caistor   
 Yarborough Secondary Modern.This      
 scheme to be implemented by Sept.1986.
