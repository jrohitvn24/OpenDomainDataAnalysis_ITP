		<content>{FAMILY LIFE -}Most families live near 
 our two schools. Some are one-parent  
 families. Most adults work locally,   
 but some are unemployed. Some mothers 
 go out to work, but others remain at  
 home and do the housework. In the     
 mornings we have breakfast between    
 7.00 and 8.30. On weekdays we are at  
 school from 9.00 a.m. until 3.15 or   
 3.30p.m. We have lunch there and tea  
 at home. Evenings and Weekends: We    
 play at home or on the recreation     
 ground. Our families watch Television 
 or go for walks. Sometimes our parents
 go to the pub. Occasionally relatives 
 come to stay or we go to visit them.  
 Many families have pets. We wear      
 school clothes on weekdays and play   
 clothes at home. We dress up in our   
 best clothes to go out. Many mothers  
 can knit and sew, and they make some  
 of our clothes.                       </content>
