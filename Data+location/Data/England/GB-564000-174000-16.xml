		<title>16GRAVESEND TO TILBURY FERRY</title>
		<content> The site of the {GRAVESEND TO TILBURY 
{FERRY}is one of the oldest in         
 South-East England. Now owned by      
 British Rail and Sealink, the ferry   
 crosses the river Thames,linking{Kent}
 with Essex. The service was once owned
 by the{Southern Railway Company}and   
 the company's initals can be seen on  
 a bench at the end of the jetty.The   
 service is good, with over 40         
 crossings every weekday. It is,       
 however expensive a return ticket     
 costing Â£2.00 for the short           
 crossing.The ferry is used by people  
 who work on either side of the        
 Thames,with the earliest leaving      
 Gravesend at  05.45. Though the       
 buldings are in poor condition and    
 it is badly signposted , the ferry    
 provides an important link with people
 on the other side of the river.
