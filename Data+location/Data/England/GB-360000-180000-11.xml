		<title>11LIFESTYLES IN PATCHWAY</title>
		<content> Fashion is quite varied today.For     
 discos you might wear a mini skirt or 
 trousers, but longer skirts are worn  
 in the day.You occasionally see punks 
 in Patchway,some with an ear-ring     
 through their nose,chains, or black   
 leather jackets with zips on them.    
 Some people have coloured hair. Most  
 ladies have short hair in a bobbed    
 style.                                
    In the area people enjoy gardening,
 wine-making and cookery.Sports such as
 football,squash, tennis and swimming  
 are also popular.You can play tennis  
 and football at Patchway High but     
 swimmers must go to Thornbury or      
 Filton.                               
   People eat a lot of convenience     
 food,using gadgets such as microwaves 
 and deep freezers.The local           
 hypermarket sells both convenience and
 fresh foods.                          </content>
