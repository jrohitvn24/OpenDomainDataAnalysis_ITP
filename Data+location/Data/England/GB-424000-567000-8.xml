 Heaton Manor School is a school which 
 is split up into two different sites. 
 The two schools are approximately one 
 and a half miles apart. The two sites 
 are called 'Jesmond' and 'Benton' and 
 now have better facilities.           
                                       
 Most kids did not like it at first    
 because they thought there would be   
 trouble but now it is much beter than 
 it was before. People from both       
 schools have made more friends.       
                                       
 Years 1 and 2 are at Jesmond. Yars 3-5
 are at Benton. If you wish to stay on 
 to the sixth Form you leave Benton and
 return to Jesmond. the teachers have  
 to travel back and forward from site  
 to site every day to teach lessons.
