		<content>   The area is situated in the N.E of  
 Sheffield on its boundary with        
 Rotherham and crossed by the M1, at   
 junction 34. The dominant geographical
 feature is Wincobank Hill, overlooking
 the former industrial valley of the   
 Don. What was once the hub of         
 Sheffield steel production is now an  
 industrial wasteland with some newer, 
 small, light industry. The private    
 houses and council estates of         
 Brightside, Shiregreen, Wincobank,    
 Blackburn and Firth Park are served by
 the large Northern General Hospital, 3
 large comprehensives and their feeder 
 schools, 2 major shopping centres, 3  
 large parks and Concord Sports        
 Centre.This area, with its roots deep 
 in Sheffield's history, now has a     
 growing Pakistani community living    
 alongside its other residents.
