		<title>08CHILDREN'S GAMES</title>
		<content>    I am 11 years old and I have made a
 collection of the games played in our 
 school playground. Not all of these   
 games are played at the same time -   
 there are 'seasons' for most of them. 
 A lot of the games are based on T.V.  
 programmes but some are very old.     
   Line touch; hide and seek; touch;   
 skipping; marbles; hopscotch; Jacob's 
 ladder; heads down, thumb's up; polo; 
 nuts and bolts, bulldog- one person is
 'on it' and that person says BULLDOG. 
 The other people run across the       
 playground and if one is caught that  
 person is 'on it'; Coca Cola release; 
 sticky glue - one person is 'on it',  
 the others hold on to their fingers   
 until they say STICKY GLUE as part of 
 the story that is told. Everyone runs 
 away and if they are touched stand    
 with legs apart to be released by a   
 player going through; 40,40;dead lions</content>
