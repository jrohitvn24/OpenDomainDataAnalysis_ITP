		<content> The Church is in the middle of the    
 village it is a 14th century Church   
 but it has a 13th century tower       
 because the rest of the Church was    
 rebuilt after a fire.                 
 Bay Cottage or as it used to be called
 Bay House was the local policemans    
 house.It has small rooms which were   
 used to lock up felons for the        
 night.The rooms have been turned into 
 utility rooms,washing room,larder and 
 cupboards.                            
 The village is gradually being        
 modernised some council houses have   
 been built and an old yard which had  
 animal sheds in it,is being torn down 
 and converted into eight houses with  
 garages.The village is very isolated  
 and the people there have to go to    
 Barnstaple for shopping.
