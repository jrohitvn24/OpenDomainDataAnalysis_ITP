 Vernham Dean, entertainment is largely
 of our own making. As a result the    
 village has thriving activities for

 school there is a lively Theatre      
 Club, giving public performances for  
 Christmas entertainment. The          
 Women Institute meets once a month and
 has a large membership. Dances are    
 held as fund raisers for many         
 different causes, Friends of the      
 School,Theatre Club. The Friends of   
 the Church hold the Harvest Supper and
 meetings of general interest in the

 activities. Bazaars and fetes are held
 to raise money to improve the         
 amenities of the village.The Georgians
