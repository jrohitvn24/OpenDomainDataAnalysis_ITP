 The survey block we are looking at    
 is the one which includes{Peel Park}  
 (our School).  The block has a lot of 
 houses as Accrington is an industrial 
 town.  There is one main road in our  
 block{- Burnley Road.} One of the     
 first things you see when you look at 
 our block is the cemetery where people
 are buried or cremated.  The other big
 thing is the{Coppice}which is a large 
 hill just a couple of minutes away    
 from my school.  it is a few hundred  
 feet short of being a mountain.       
 Next week a new{motorway}is being     
 opened  which has been cut through the
 Coppice.  It runs for most of the way 
 parallel to the{King's Highway}which  
 is one of the area's ancient roads. It
 is hoped the new road will cut down   
 traffic through the town centre.
