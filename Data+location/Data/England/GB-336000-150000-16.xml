		<content>    LOOKING AT THE COURSE OF THE MARK  
YEO ON THE ORDNANCE SURVEY MAP,THE     
FIRST THOUGH IS THAT THIS NOW SMALL    
RIVER IS VERY STRAIGHT.IT MUST MAN     
MADE,OR AT LEAST HAVE BEEN STRAIGHTENED
 Y MAN.TO THE NORTH OF THE BLOCK,IT    
 OINS THE'OLD'RIVER AXE THEN TO THE    
RIVER AXE AND TO THE BRISTOL CHANNEL AT
UPHILL.                                
    TODAY IT IS NO MORE THAN A         
WIDE,STRAIGHT DITCH,FULL OF WATER WITH 
ACCESS ALONG ITS BANK FOR CATTLE TO    
DRINK.                                 
    IT WAS NOT ALWAYS SO.IN THE DARK   
AGES WHEN THE ABBOTT OF GLASTONBURY WAS
AT POWER IN THE LAND,GOODS FOR THE     
ABBEY WERE BROUGHT TO THE PORT OF      
UPHILL AND ONWARDS,BY SMALL BOATS,TO   
THE MARK YEO AND THEN BY WAY OF THE    
RIVER BRUE TO GLASTONBURY.             
    ONCE AN IMPORTANT WATERWAY,TODAY   
PART OF OUR MOORLAND DRAINAGE SYSTEM.  </content>
