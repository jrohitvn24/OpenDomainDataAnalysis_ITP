		<content> Our church is the only anglican church
 in our area.It was built in year 1869 
 by Sir Roundell Palmer, Q.C., the 1st 
 Earl of Selborne. Alfred Waterhouse   
 designed the church, and also the     
 vicarage. The village hall next to the
 church used to be the village school. 
 At first, the attendance varied from  
 65 children in June and November to 48
 in August and 43 in October. The      
 school was a private one only for     
 children from the Blackmoor estate.   
 After the Education Act of 1870 the   
 school was made a Public Elementary   
 School. The school was officially     
 opened on Easter Tuesday, April 11th  
 1871. The school has now moved to     
 another part of the village. The      
 vicar, the Reverend R.Inkpen, has been
 at Blackmoor for 16 years.
