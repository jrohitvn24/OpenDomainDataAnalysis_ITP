		<content> The Sands sports and leisure Centre   
 was opened by Labour Party leader Neil
 Kinnock in April 1985. Local Conserv- 
 ative councillors threatened to       
 boycott the ceremony because they felt
 a non-political personality such as   
 Daley Thompson should have been       
 invited.                              
  Though the Centre cost City rate-    
 payers Â£4 million to build, nearly    
 all would agree that it provides much 
 needed (and used) facilities, and a   
 venue worthy of nationally known      
 entertainers, such as singer Barbara  
 Dickson, comedian Lenny Henry, and the
 Scottish National Orchestra. The      
 larger hall can accommodate up to 1500
 on tiered seating which slides away to
 provide 10,700 square feet of games   
 space.Tickets _ printed by computer   
 with your name on _ cost between Â£3.50
 and Â£4.50 for the  Lenny Henry Show.  </content>
