		<title>16TOURISM - General</title>
		<content> The area caters mainly for people who 
 wish to walk, fish,or visit places of 
 interest within driving distance, or  
 partake in water sports.  For walking 
 the area is used as a base and people 
 will travel as far afield as the Lake 
 District, the N Yorks Moors or the    
 Northumbrian coast.  There is good    
 walking locally on the moors.  Many   
 people come to see the Blue Gentian   
 flowers peculiar to the area in Upper 
 Teesdale and to walk the Durham -     
 Cumbria section of the Pennine Way.   
 Places of major interest in the       
 village are the site of a medieval    
 castle and an old water mill and the  
 confluence of the Balder and Tees     
 rivers.                               
 To those who can find accommodation in
 the village it is possible to travel a
 radius of some 70-80 miles to places  
 of interest.                          </content>
