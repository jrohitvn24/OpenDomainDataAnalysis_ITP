		<content>   The Hospital Plan of 1962 has seen a
 complete change in the attitude       
 towards the care of the mentally      
 handicapped.The large{institutions}are
 being replaced by{community homes}and 
 this policy has seen a{decrease}in the
 number of residents at Calderstones.  
   Calderstones is presently 3 years   
 into a 10 year plan which foresees the
 housing of its residents back in the  
 community and the hospital's eventual 
{closure.                              
  {Lack of finance,}particularly in the
 provision of suitable community homes 
 is holding up progress and it is      
 generally thought that the{plan}will  
 have to be{extended.                  
  {Opposition}to the closure has been  
 voiced in many quarters-one fact still
 remains,the{closure}of the hospital   
 will have an effect on the{local      
{community}-how much is to be seen!    </content>
