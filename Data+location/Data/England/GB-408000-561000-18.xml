		<content> We have done a survey about           
 television.We have found out that:    
 Most people prefer to watch Tyne Tees 
 Television than any other channel     
 available.Only two people from 25     
 preferred to watch BBC1 and BBC2.     
 Most people watched television for 5  
 hours a day,but some people watch it  
 for 8 hours.                          
 The most popular programmes were      
 Coronation Street (a soapopera) and   
 Minder(a crime comedy).The most       
 popular cartoon was Dungeons And      
 Dragons,(fantasy adventure). The most 
 popular films were Ghostbusters,Return
 Of The Jedi and Rocky 3.Nowadays      
 people are able to watch films in the 
 house because, of recently invented   
 video recorders and cable T.V.
