		<title>12My Sunday in Woodlesford.</title>
		<content> I jump out of bed ready and fit to    
 dance because it is a competition day 
 in Bradford,so everybody runs down    
 stairs to try to get first to         
 breakfast. I have cereals and toast,  
 but I don't eat much because I have   
 butterflies.                          
 When we are ready my dad starts the   
 car and we set off. We arrive at the  
 dancehall for 9.45 and the first round
 is at 10.30. When everybody gets      
 changed they are all waiting for the  
 first round to start. The first round 
 is the gold bars section. Then all the
 people walk onto the floor waiting for
 the record to start. After we've      
 finished they give you your positions.
 I came third,I get a bronze medal and 
 I am excited, it's my first           
 competition.                          
           .
