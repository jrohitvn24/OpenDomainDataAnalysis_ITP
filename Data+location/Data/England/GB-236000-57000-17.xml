		<title>17TEMATON/ST.ERNEY SUMMARY</title>
		<content> This area has been farmed and worked  
 since Anglo Saxon times,possibly even 
 from the Bronze Age.In many ways it   
 would seem to have changed little over
 the years,the noise of the quarry men 
 blasting for slate has been replaced  
 on occasions by the noise of the      
 military testing their{explosives.    
 There are fewer than{200 registered   
{electors}living in the area; they     
 either work the land,commute to       
 Saltash or Plymouth to work or they   
 are retired.Nowhere in the area are   
 you more than 30 minutes drive from   
 the{Tamar Bridge}and yet it is a very 
 quiet and private place seemingly     
 content to let the rest of the world  
 rush by.                              
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
