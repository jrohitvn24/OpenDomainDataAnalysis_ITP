		<title>04OLD WARDOUR CASTLE.</title>
		<content>{Old Wardour Castle}was built in{1393  
 and{13000}people visit it each year.In
 the{Civil War}the castle was beseiged 
 by{Sir Edward Hungerford,}a           
{Parlimentarian}with{1300 men.}There   
 were merely{25 fighting men}in the    
 castle.They held out for{7 days.}Later
 it was beseiged by the{Royalists.}That
 seige lasted for{ten months.}The      
 damage was never repaired.{The grotto 
 was built in the{18th century}at the  
 same time as the{New Castle}about one 
 kilometre away. The lakes were made   
 at the same time.The Old Castle was   
 over 4 storeys high.{The frost, the   
{pigeons and the weather}make the      
 castle crumble and sag a bit but it is
 not in danger of falling down. There  
 is scaffolding up around the castle at
 the moment.
