		<title>11Woodvale Airfield, Ainsdale</title>
		<content>   The small{RAF}base at Woodvale lies 
 between the Liverpool to Southport    
 railway and the A565. Trains, planes  
 and cars travel in close proximity.   
 Once an asparagus farm, Woodvale has  
 been an RAF base since 1943, when it  
 was a Spitfire fighter base in World  
 War Two. Air-raid shelters remain.    
 Now, its main purpose is to train     
 pilots for the RAF. It is run by 11   
 officers and 50 civilians. There are  
 three runways and several camouflaged 
 buildings, including the Officers'    
 Mess and Liverpool Squadron HQ. There 
 are two hangars and a small control   
 tower.                                
   Woodvale is used by two{flying clubs
 and three RAF squadrons. The RAF use  
 'Chipmunk' and 'Bulldog' planes. The  
 flying clubs use Cessna planes and    
 charge Â£30.78 for an hour's tuition.
