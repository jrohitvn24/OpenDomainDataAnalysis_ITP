		<title>14GAMES WE PLAY IN LEASINGHAM.</title>
		<content> At home when we find a{tennis ball}we 
 all gather round in a little  circle. 
 Then one person says"eeni-meeni-miney 
 -mo-you are not it".We keep on doing  
 this until the last person picks up   
 the tennis ball and counts to ten.He  
 runs around chasing every one and     
 throws the tennis ball.If the tennis  
 ball hits someone,that person has     
 to pick up the ball and throw it at   
 someone else.If another person gets   
 hit by the tennis ball they have to   
 try and and throw the ball at someone 
 else.That game is called{tennis ball  
{tig.                                  
 The next game is where the person that
 is"on"has to tig another person       
 anywhere on the body and the person   
 has to hold that part of the body     
 and tig some one else on any part of  
 the body.That game is called{Hospital
