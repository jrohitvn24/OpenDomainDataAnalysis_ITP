		<content> were in the development of industry. A
 new{industrial estate}at Quarry Wood  
 has allowed the development of light  
 industry including engineering and    
 Post Office Supplies storage.         
 Aylesford also hosts the{Royal British
{Legion Village}light industries which 
 includes making poppies for           
 Remembrance Day. The small amount of  
 industry  has led to a more than      
 proportionate generation of{traffic   
{and local employment.}                
    There are many{service             
{industries,}reflecting the highly     
 residential character of the area.    
 Shopping places include the Mid-Kent  
 Shopping Centre.Housing estates boast 
 their parades of convenience shops and
 many street corners have their small  
 general store.Some larger shops are   
 found nearer the centre.
