		<title>17FRIENDS OF ELMBRIDGE</title>
		<content> Elmbridge has a group of women who    
 meet several times a year in order to 
 organise functions to raise funds for 
 the church, community projects and    
 local charities. Coffee mornings are  
 held in members homes when            
 arrangements are made to clean the    
 church or to help a needy neighbour.  
 All newcomers to the village are      
 welcomed with a gift and an invitation
 to join in the local events. Newborn  
 babies, the sick or the elderly are   
 also visited and presented with a     
 gift. The village hall is maintained  
 and run by the Friends of Elmbridge   
 and is used for most social functions.
 These have great support from the     
 community, and help to keep it        
 together. Any money made at these     
 gatherings is used for the most needy 
 charity of the moment.
