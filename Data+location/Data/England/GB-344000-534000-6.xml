		<content> Outside the woods, plant life is      
 dominated by agricultural grassland   
 and cops, and by roadside verges.     
                                       
 The Park has not been ploughed for    
 many years, but it has been fertilised
 so is species poor.                   
                                       
 The roadside verges are probably the  
 richest for species, which include    
 some less common examples.            
                                       
 The pond plant associations are very  
 typical and include herb paris, bog   
 bean and flag, with kingcup very      
 common in the streams.                
                                       
 There are a few typical wood edge     
 plant associations.
