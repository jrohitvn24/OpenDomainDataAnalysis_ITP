		<content>   I live on a farm in the village.I   
 get up at eight o'clock to help my dad
 deliver milk.After that I get my      
 breakfast then go and watch television
 for a little bit then I go out to call
 for my friends.We sometimes play      
 tennis.After  we have finished        
 playing,we go swimming in the river.I 
 took my friend's dinghy.It is cold    
 when you first get in.We swim a few   
 lengths then I eat my packed lunch.I  
 had some egg sandwiches some sweets   
 and an apple too.Then it was time to  
 go home.When I got home,my mam said   
 Icould stay out till five o'clock     
 because that is when my tea is        
 ready.Then I went out.I like taking my
 dog for a walk so I took it for a     
 walk.I took it through the fields.My  
 dog is called Bess.Then I put her back
 in her kennel.I got the dogs' bowls   
 and filled them with water.           </content>
