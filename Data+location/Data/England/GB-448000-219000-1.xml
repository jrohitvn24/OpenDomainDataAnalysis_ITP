		<content>     These pages were compiled by the  
children of Kirtlington School, helped 
by the ladies of Kirtlington W.I..     
   Mentioned in the original Domesday  
Book, Kirtlington is situated          
about twelve miles north of Oxford.    
It is surrounded on one side by        
Kirtlington Park and the landscape on  
the other side slopes down towards the 
Oxford Canal. The road through         
Kirtlington crosses Akeman Street at   
the northern end and leads on to the   
U.S.A.F. Base at Upper Heyford. The    
population of Kirtlington has grown to 
approximately 960 in recent years with 
housing development discreetly         
contained "inside" the village.        
    There is one church in Kirtlington,
it is Church of England.               
     There are 9 ponds and lakes in the
area. Next to Kytes Pond there is a    
Village Hall.                          </content>
