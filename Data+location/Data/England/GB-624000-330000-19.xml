{or  ALDBOROUGH} Doctor.Most children  
 go to {NORTH WALSHHAM }Health         
 centre.There is nealy always somebody 
 off of school because they are ill.   
 At {NORTH WALSHAM COTTAGE HOSPITAL    
 there is a{MATERNITY UNIT,}which is   
 threatened with closure,and women     
 would have to go to the Norfolk       
 and Norwich Hospital where the        
 facilities are much better although   
 North Walsham is much smaller and some
 say cosier.                           
 At the North Walsham Health Centre    
 clinics are run for all areas of      
 health care.                          
 There are 8 or 9 doctors,practice     
 nurses,Health Visitors,Midwives and 2 
 dispensaries.                         
 Soon new surgeries are being built as
