		<content> Monks from{Worth School}become        
 involved in many aspects of the       
 community. One goes to Gatwick and    
 helps out as a chaplain. Another would
 be the co-ordinator in the event of a 
 nuclear war so the Abbey is part of   
 a radio network for the whole of      
 Sussex. The Abbot is Abbot President  
 over the English Benedictine          
 Community. He wishes the Abbey to be  
 an ecumenical centre for Sussex and   
 further afield.                       
 The{High Street}is so called because  
 it runs along a ridge and is quite    
 literally high. Crawley Lane runs     
 south from the High Street. It once   
 ran north past Greentrees Farm right  
 through to Crawley. Recently there was
 an attempt to change the name which   
 was resisted by some local people so  
 the name remains the same.
