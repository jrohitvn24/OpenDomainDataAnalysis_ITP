		<title>12S.CROYDON BUS GARAGE</title>
		<content> On the first day of May we went to    
 South Croydon bus garage.You have to  
 be at least twenty_one to be a bus    
 driver.In the morning the bus driver  
 signs on.At lunch time the mechanics  
 change the route and bus numbers.After
 a day's work the drivers and the      
 conductors give in all their money and
 if they have not got enough it has to 
 come from their own pockets.          
 In 1941 a bomb dropped on the         
 garage,destroying 180 buses.In 1952 it
 was reopened.Every bus has T.C. on it 
 after the original owner Thomas       
 Tilling of Croydon.The buses are now  
 run by London Regional Transport.They 
 have four lady drivers,one roofless   
 bus and a total of 124 buses at the   
 garage.There is a canteen for the     
 staff.                                
                                       
                                       </content>
