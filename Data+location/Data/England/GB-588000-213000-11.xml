		<title>11Children in Families</title>
		<content> On July 2nd,I decided to find out the 
 average number of children in a family
 and the average number of years       
 inbetween two children that were born 
 one after the other.I picked four     
 junior classes from St.Lukes school.I 
 asked each class who lived in the area
 we were surveying.Then at random I    
 picked three people in each of the    
 four classes and questioned them      
 individually the questions I asked    
 were:- 1)How  many children in your   
 family including you?                 
        2)How old are your brothers and
 sisters and how old are you?          
 No.1 results:-2,2,2,2,2,3,3,2,3,1,2,2.
 No.2 results:-                        
 10,9  15,17,10 11,5     8             
 11,14 10,12    11,15    16,8          
 11,11 14,10,7  14,16,11 12,9  The     
 average number for No.1 was 2 and the 
 average number for No.2 was 3 years.  </content>
