		<title>16The Handicapped --St.Helens</title>
		<content> There are many handicapped people in  
 St.Helens.The Social Services and     
 several voluntary organisations help  
 to make life better for those who have
 disabilities.Help is offered to the   
 elderly, the blind, the deaf,the      
 physically and mentally handicapped.  
 Much of the help is carried out with  
 the people living in their own        
 homes.Home Helps or Meals on Wheels   
 travel to the person's house and give 
 assistance there.                     
   Specially adapted buses transport   
 the people to centres,where there are 
 opportunities to take part in social  
 and craft actities.                   
   Many elderley people live in special
 hostels,or live in a group of special 
 houses, supervised by a warden.More of
 these are being built in 1985 near    
 Rainhill Hospital.The hope is to get  
 more patients back in the community.  </content>
