		<content> The day starts when my parents arise  
 at 6.30am.My eldest brother does a    
 paper round at 7.00am.We breakfast at 
 7.30am and this consists of cereal and
 toast.When not attending school we    
 have a snack lunch and a cooked meal  
 in the evening.We use  electricity for
 cooking as there is no gas supply.We  
 use coal and anthracite for heating.We
 listen to the radio, watch television 
 and play on our home computer.Our only
 pet is a hamster.                     
 My alarm clock wakes me up at 7.15am. 
 I have a bowl of cereal for breakfast 
 and listen to the radio.When I come   
 home from school my tea is being      
 cooked by Mum.We normally have the    
 television on at night.I have a pet   
 cat.
