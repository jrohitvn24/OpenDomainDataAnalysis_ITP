		<title>20WETHERBY - STAY IN LEEDS ?</title>
		<content>  Although the unbiased Commission     
 decided in favour of the move into    
 North Yorkshire, there are still many 
 local councillors who believe we      
 should remain under the control of    
 Leeds City Council. These include many
 Tories on Leeds City Council who want 
 Wetherby to remain in Leeds, because  
 if Wetherby leaves they may never     
 regain power- as Wetherby is a major  
 Tory stronghold in the city.          
  As well as the political arguments   
 put forward there are several social  
 and economic reasons for staying in   
 the Leeds City area. These include    
 transport, education and central      
 planning, producing more efficient    
 management of the area. In the Leeds  
 area transport is subsidised resulting
 in cheap fares for old, young and     
 unemployed people. Leeds also has a   
 better pupil/teacher ratio.           </content>
