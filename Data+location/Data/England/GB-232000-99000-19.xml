		<title>19THEFT AT CLAWTON SCHOOL</title>
		<content>    This disk was nearly not completed 
 because on the{9th of September 1984  
 the school discovered that{thieves}had
 cleverly broken in and stolen our     
{computer equipment}and all of our     
 programmes.                           
    The{police}came in to investigate.A
 piece of wood was broken off a window 
 in our classroom.They had hit the     
 window frame and the lock came        
 undone.The police did not find any    
{fingerprints}with their powder,so the 
{burglars}must have been wearing       
 gloves.                               
    The school regained its full       
 equipment on the{19th of June         
 1985.We ordered a new{BBC computer    
 for the school.First came the{V.D.U.  
 then the computer{keyboard}and finally
 the disk drive.After that we ordered a
 printer LX-80.So all's well that ends}
 well.                                 </content>
