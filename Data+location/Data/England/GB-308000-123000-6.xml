		<title>06THE HERDSMAN'S DAY</title>
		<content> The typical Herdsmans day starts when 
 he gets up at 5.15am,he gets dressed, 
 goes down stairs and puts his boots   
 on. He goes into the milking parlour  
 and gets it ready for the cows.Each   
 cows give about 8 gallons of          
 milk a day.Then he takes the cows into
 the field so he can get on with his   
 job of cleaning the parlour with the  
 scraper.Then he will wash the milk    
 machines and turn the cooler off.The  
 milk goes through tubes into the tank.
 Then he will come in and have his     
 breakfast at about 8.00am.He will then
 feed the calves and the bulls with    
 cake and hay and bed them with straw. 
 After this he will go and help with   
 other jobs like haymaking until       
 1.00pm.The cows have to be milked     
 again in the afternoon and the milk   
 stored until the next morning when the
 tanker comes to collect it.           </content>
