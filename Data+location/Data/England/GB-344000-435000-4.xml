 some privately owned and some council 
 owned residential dwellings. The Eagle

 building is the only public house. The
 main land owners are Cluttens (pension

 Enviroment who own several acres of   
 land in Wharles, occupied by H.M.S.   
 Inskip. Rabbits, partridge and        
 pheasants are still a common sight in 
 the area. There is no school and the  
 local primary age children attend the 
 school at Treales.The secondary school
 age children travel by bus to Kirkham 
 and adults can also travel on this    
 bus.There is also one bus a week to   
 Kirkham on market day (Thursday).     
 There are travelling fish, vegetable  
 and library vans. Meat is only        
 delivered to order, the working smithy
 functions no longer as a blacksmith.  </content>
