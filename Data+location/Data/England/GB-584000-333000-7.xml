		<content> The affairs of the Parish are         
 administered by a Parish Council      
 comprised of nine elected members and 
 a paid clerk without voting rights.   
 It operates under the jurisdiction of 
 the West Norfolk District Council,    
 which is the local authority          
 responsible for all public services in
 this community.  A proportion of the  
 rates collected by the district       
 authority are returned to the parish  
 council to be spent at local level.   
 The powers of the Parish Council are  
 very limited and although it is able  
 to advise and make recommendations to 
 the district council, the final       
 decisions are always taken at district
 level.  The parish council does       
 provide a means by which local        
 residents can raise issues of         
 immediate concern for public          
 discussion and action.                </content>
