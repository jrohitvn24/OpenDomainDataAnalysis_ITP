		<content> I have found that one of the most     
 popular pastimes of children in this  
 area is home computing and video      
 games.Only 4 years ago a home computer
 was a rarity.They are especially      
 popular in the long winter evenings   
 when at one time people would just    
 have watched television,read or       
 knitted.Another popular activity is   
 fishing.In the fishing season there   
 are many local fishing contests down  
 on the River Parrett.Recently there   
 was a lot of controversy over the use 
 of bronze maggots and lead shot.Both  
 are potentially dangerous to wildlife 
 that inhabit the banks of local       
 streams and rivers.The maggots are now
 banned and lead shot is slowly being  
 replaced by a new kind of shot that is
 non_toxic.
