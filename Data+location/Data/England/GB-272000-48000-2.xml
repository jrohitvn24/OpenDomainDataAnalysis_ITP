		<content> The whole area is thinly settled.     
 Apart from a few scattered farms there
 are only three settlements, all in the
 south of the area,                    
 The village of Loddiswell,            
 The hamlet of Woodleigh,              
 The hamlet of The Mounts.             
 Loddiswell is by far the largest of   
 the three places.Its earliest growth  
 was below the church, in Well Street, 
 but the village has spread up to the  
 higher, more level ground to the west.
 In the last ten years many new houses 
 have been built. In Elmwood Park      
 there is quite a large estate of      
 detatched, semi detatched, and        
 terraced houses and bungalows.        
 Nearby in Oakwood Park there is a     
 small development of detatched or     
 linked houses, built on a site        
 where wartime "prefabs" once stood.
