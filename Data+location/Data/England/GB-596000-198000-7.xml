 A child wrote "We went to C.S.B.Moulds
 They make plastic mouldings like      
 make-up containers and inhalers for   
 medical purposes.They send them all   
 over the world.The factory has been   
 there for 8 years. There are 70 ladies
 and 40 men who work for 12 hours a    
 day.There is a drawing room.The       
 drawings looked very complicated with 
 lots of lines.These designs were for  
 the machines to make the moulds.We saw
 the inhalers being made,they make 30  
 million a year.Then we saw the ladies 
 checking the mouldings and the packing
 room where all the boxes were stacked 
 up on top of each other."             </content>
