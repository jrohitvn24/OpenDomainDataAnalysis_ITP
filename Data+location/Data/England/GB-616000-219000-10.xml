		<title>10OUR INTERVIEWS</title>
		<content> We wanted to ask people some          
 questions about living in our Village.
 We chose 3 different groups of people 
 and they came into school &amp; we        
 interviewed them. Half of them had    
 always{lived}here or near here- the   
 next biggest group came here from     
 London. What{they liked}about the     
 Village was the fact it was in the    
 country &amp; a friendly place. The worst 
 of{the dislikes}was the amount of     
 traffic. When asked what{extra amenity
 the Village needed, more than 50% said
 a chemist. Apart from not much work   
 here, what{concerned them}was the need
 of a Village bypass.This was also     
 mentioned as the{main improvement}    
 needed.{In the future}they thought a  
 bypass would be built &amp; with more     
 development, our Village would        
 eventually join up with Clacton.They  
 didn't like this at all.              </content>
