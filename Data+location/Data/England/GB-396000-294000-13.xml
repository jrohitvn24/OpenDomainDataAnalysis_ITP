		<title>13Gospel Oak.</title>
		<content>  This area is mainly residential.     
 There are four areas. The largest is  
 the Wednesbury Oak estate, which is a 
 group of private houses off{Wednesbury
{Oak  Road. }The  smaller  areas  are  
{Swallowdale, Rocket Pool}and the most 
 recent {Burberry  Grange. }In  1985,  
 Burberry Grange is still being built, 
 although the first phase is already   
 occupied.                             
  At the corner of Wednesbury Oak Road 
 and Bilston  Road is the{Gospel  Oak  
{Tavern,}still known locally by its old
 name of{Mother  Shipton's.}There is a 
 legend that the pub is still haunted  
 by the ghost of{Mother  Shipton}who   
 wanders around calling her dog. There 
 are  people  who  claim  to  have     
 photographed  it,  although  no       
 photographs  have  been  found.
