      Rookhope School has a Headteacher
 whose teaching load is fifty per cent 
 of the school week. This time is spent
 mostly with the Junior-aged children, 
 but there is some involvement also    
 with the younger age-range. One       
 full-time and one part-time teacher   
 complete the teaching staff.          
      The School Secretary works three 
 mornings a week on Mondays, Wednesdays
 and Fridays. A Cleaner-in-Charge is   
 responsible for cleaning and keeping  
 the school tidy.                      
      A Senior Meals Attendant and     
 Supervisory Assistant prepare,        
 distribute, look after and tidy up    
 during the lunch hour.                
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
