 recordings from all the other stations
 nationwide,are computed,meteorologists
 compare patterns and predict weather  
 by establishing a trend after studying

 a specific period.                    
   Instruments used include a Rain     
 Gauge, a Sunshine Indicator, a Weather
 Vane and 7 thermometers. The highest
