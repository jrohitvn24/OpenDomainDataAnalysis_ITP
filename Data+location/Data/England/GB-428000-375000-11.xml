		<content> Barbrook Reservoir is situated on high
 moorland to the west of Holmesfield,  
 near Owler Bar.It is 8.2m deep and    
 provides half a million gallons a day 
 to Northern Chesterfield.This would   
 supply about 5,000 homes.The{reservoir
 is owned by the Severn Trent Water    
 Authority.It is built on peat         
 moorland,has an embankment with a clay
 core and has a{weir}to disperse       
 excess water.It was built in 1910,    
 uses gravity to feed the water and    
 treats the water with chlorine,lime   
 and sulphur dioxide.The{acid water    
 will not support plant or fish life.  
 The area is good for the observation  
 of migratory birds.The clear,treated  
 water is stored in tanks,one          
 underground ,for use when the         
{filtration system}is undergoing its   
 daily clean.The only source of        
 electricity is a diesel generator.    </content>
