		<content>      All houses at Sea Road, Carlyon  
 Bay, are detatched and have 2 or 3    
 storeys. Detatched houses are not     
 joined to any other house. They are   
 made of blocks. They are very         
 expensive. The road they face onto is 
 private.                              
      A typical house in Sea Road has  
 several large windows, and a large    
 front door. They have chimneys and    
 they owners may use open fires.       
 There's also an extension on the      
 front. These houses are mostly owned  
 by people who are fairly well off. The
 house owners welcome tourists and     
 there are many sights for             
 accomodation. There are many hotels.  
      Nearby are some detatched and    
 semi-detatched houses, offering a     
 place for people who cannot afford to 
 buy their own home, such as old       
 people, family or young people.       </content>
