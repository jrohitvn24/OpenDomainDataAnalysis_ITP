		<content> The level of the salt marshes is being
 raised due to Spartina Grass growing  
 in recent years.  There are many wild 
 flowers.  It is a site of special     
 scientific interest.  Samphire grows  
 which is delicious to eat as a        
 vegetable or pickled.  Cowslips,      
 primroses are amoung many flowers     
 growing in hedgerows and meadows.  The
 sea wall is ablaze with flowers in    
 spring and summer.  Last year there   
 were three Great Mullein plants on the
 shore.  The hawthorn hedges are a mass
 of blossom and dog roses in summer.   
 Goose grass locally known as "Sticky  
 Willie" is very common.
