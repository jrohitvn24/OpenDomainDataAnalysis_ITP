		<title>14SOUTHSEA CHURCHES</title>
		<content>    {St Jude's Church }started with the
 Rev.Owen who suggested to his brother 
{Thomas Owen}that his houses in South- 
 sea weren't selling because there was 
 no church nearby. Owen built St.      
 Jude's Church in 1815. In 1973 the    
 church was closed for 6months whilst  
 being modernised.                     
       The {Temple of Spiritualism }in 
 Southsea began in 1901. In 1938 the   
 building was pulled down and was the  
 only religious building allowed to be 
 finished during the 2nd World War.    
     The Portsmouth {Mosque}is in      
 Marmion Road.They pray everyday,      
 especially on Fridays as this is their
 holy day. They have nothing in their  
 prayer rooms except prayer mats which 
 face Mecca in Saudi Arabia.Moslems    
 believe there is one God,Allah. They  
 do believe in Jesus but only as a     
 prophet and not the Son of God.       </content>
