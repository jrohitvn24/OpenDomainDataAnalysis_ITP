		<title>13FILKINS: TERRAIN/BUILDINGS</title>
		<content>Limestone downs and valleys cover most 
of this block in the Cotswolds. The R. 
Leach and water from Filkins Springs   
drain south to the nearby Thames Val-  
ley. The water at Eastleach and Filkins
ensured early settlement there. Traces 
of wooden round huts and Saxon burial  
grounds have been found at Filkins but 
only hints of medieval buildings now   
remain. The pattern of closes for en-  
closing animals at night, and open     
commons, can still be seen. Almost all 
the standing buildings are of stone    
quarried within the block. Stone for   
field and house walling, and fine 'for-
est marble' for slate roofs and paving 
are all to be found. From the 17TH     
CENTURY, 6 houses have been listed as  
noteworthy, and also a fine three-     
storey mill house with hipped roof. We 
identify about 12 cottages of the      
period which are similar in size.      </content>
