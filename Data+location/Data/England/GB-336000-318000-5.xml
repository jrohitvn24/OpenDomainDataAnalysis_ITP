		<title>05LIFE IN KINTON, NESSCLIFFE</title>
		<content> Kinton is very quiet there are only   
 a few children.  I spend most of my   
 time watching the tractors and the    
 irrigator. Alot of helicopters fly    
 over our house and land on the army   
 training camp and sometimes you can   
 see men running about with their      
 guns.My Mum takes me to Nesscliffe    
 school each day by car.  My sister    
 will go to school at Baschurch next   
 year by bus - the only one that goes  
 through Kinton. The library van comes 
 every 2 weeks.  My friends come from  
 Nesscliffe on their bikes to play at  
 my house.  We play Swoop and Flak on  
 the computer, they are dodging games. 
 Sometimes we play on our bikes in the 
 lane.  I have to go to Nesscliffe to  
 buy sweets or go to the Naffi shop on 
 the army camp.  I wouldn't like to    
 live anywhere else.
