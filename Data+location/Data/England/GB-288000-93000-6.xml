		<title>06EXE FLOOD RELIEF SCHEME</title>
		<content>   The{River Exe}has many natural and  
 man-made weirs. There are salmon and  
 trout in the river and it is quite    
{clean.}                               
   Before the{Flood Relief Scheme}was  
 built there was often flooding. The   
 St.Thomas area used to get the worst  
 floods, the most recent in 1960. The  
 Scheme was started in 1963 and{opened 
{in 1977.                              
   It is mainly made of steel and      
 concrete, took 50 men to build and is 
 worth{Â£m10.}It stops flooding by      
 carrying the extra water past the city
 and has gates to control the water,   
 operated by the level of the river.   
   The{bridges}for the Scheme were     
 built on dry land and then dug out    
 underneath. Station Road Bridge is    
 made of steel and concrete and is 56m 
 long.
