		<title>18Arts in Hebden Bridge</title>
		<content> For a small provincial town Hebden    
 Bridge has a lively artistic life.    
 After the demise of the manufacturing 
 industries in the 1970s many artists  
 and craftspeople moved into open      
 workshops, studios and small          
 potteries, many of which are in       
 private houses and converted mills.   
 The{Arvon Foundation}was created by   
 the poet Ted Hughes to encourage young
 writers; it is situated on farmland   
 above Heptonstall. Writers from all   
 over the world attend the workshop    
 sessions held there.                  
 Local groups like the {Literary and   
{Scientific Society}meet regularly. The
 Hebden Bridge{Light Opera Society}put 
 on musicals two or three times a year 
 and the local dramatic society        
 presents plays regularly in a small   
 theatre in Holme Street. The latter is
 a converted garage.                   </content>
