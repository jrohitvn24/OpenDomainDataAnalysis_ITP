		<title>15A day in my life</title>
		<content>   A typical Sunday for me would start 
 at 8 a.m. I go and feed my ponies and 
 water them.I return home and have my  
 breakfast.I have my food and then     
 wash.Then an hour later I fetch my    
 tack and take it down to the stables. 
 I brush the pony and put on its saddle
 and bridle.I take him out of the      
 stable and then I mount him.I take him
 up to the school area and to dressage,
 sometimes I jump the fences.          
   On my frisky pony I brush her and   
 tack her up.I take her out of the     
 stable,mount her and go for a gallop, 
 then jump her.I put her in the stable.
 I untack her.                         
   I end by riding my young pony.As he 
 is very young I only do dressage. Some
 Sundays I compete in competitions, I  
 have won a lot of cups. For the rest  
 of the day I drink tea and watch      
 television.                           </content>
