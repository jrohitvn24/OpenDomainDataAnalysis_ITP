		<title>155 CROSSES METHODIST CHURCH</title>
		<content> This church (so called because 5      
 roads meet here) is also known as the 
 "Sunshine Chapel" because the sunlight
 reflects from its yellow-gold         
 brickwork. It holds two services each 
 Sunday. Once monthly is Family        
 Worship. A social committee organises 
 a children's pantomime and            
 'housebound' party with other         
 fund-raising events. 1985 was the     
 church's centenary (it opened 10th    
 Sept. 1885 at a cost of Â£1500 ). By   
 1900 a third of its income was through
 pew rents. In 1908 it gained an organ 
 (Â£338), an organ blower was employed  
 till electricity was installed in     
 1938. For the centenary, special      
 occasions included a flower festival, 
 garden party and barn-dance and a     
 month with visiting preachers in      
 September.
