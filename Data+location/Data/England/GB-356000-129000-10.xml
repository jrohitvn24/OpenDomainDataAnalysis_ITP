		<title>10A Day in my Life-Sarah.</title>
		<content>   Mum brings in my tea at 7.30. I get 
 out of bed and plod about collecting  
 my clothes until Mum shouts at me to  
 hurry up so I get dressed quickly and 
 drink my tea before bounding          
 downstairs to make my toast for       
 breakfast.I burn my toast and have a  
 pear instead.                         
  Then I say goodbye to the ponies and 
 Mum drives me and my two sisters to   
 school.It is already hot outside but  
 cooler in the classroom where we do   
 Maths and after play ,English.        
  After lunch we have a long playtime  
 then we go in for quiet reading and   
 another lesson before we have         
 swimming.It is delicious in the pool. 
 We swim and dive and play then get out
 to dry in the sun.We have a story and 
 its time to go home.After tea I groom 
 my pony,play for a while,watch TV or  
 read until it's bedtime.              </content>
