		<title>11VIGO RUGBY FOOTBALL CLUB</title>
		<content> Vigo R.F.C. is named after the local  
 pub in which it was first formed in   
 1969.  The posts were felled and      
 trimmed elms, erected in the field    
 behind the pub - the changing rooms   
 were a disused poultry shed!          
 By 1980 the club had raised enough    
 money to build their own clubhouse on 
 its present site with 3 pitches.  They
 run 4 Saturday teams and an occasional
 Veterans side. They have a flourishing
 Colts team and in 1984 hosted the Kent
 Colts Championships. All these teams  
 are fed by a thriving mini-rugby      
 section, training on Sunday mornings. 
 Many of the parents as well as local  
 residents are social members of the   
 club and appreciate the bar           
 facilities, discos, barbeques and     
 dances that are regularly held in the 
 club house and on the field.
