		<title>12CHRISTOPHER BAINBRIDGE</title>
		<content> Christopher Bainbridge (1464-1514) is 
 Hilton's most famous son. Born in 1464
 he became Archbishop of York to Henry 
 VII in 1508. IN 1509 he became        
 ambassador to the pope for Henry VIII 
 and in 1511/12 he was created cardinal
 by Pope Julius II. Bainbridge was     
 involved in negotiations to invest    
 Henry VIII with the title 'Most       
 Christian King', but died, in 1514,   
 before these were concluded, having   
 been poisoned by a chaplain in his own
 service.
