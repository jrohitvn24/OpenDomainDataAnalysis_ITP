		<content> Camber was evacuated during the       
 l939/45 war and many of the dwellings 
 were demolished at that time.  In the 
 last few years many of the older      
 bungalows have been improved and now  
 there is a considerable programme of  
 building taking place.  One site has  
 five bungalows in the course of       
 building at prices between Â£35,950 and
 Â£40,000.  Two new estates are being   
 built with prices from Â£23,950        
 upwards.  These consist of terraced   
 and semi-detached houses, with small  
 gardens, and either build-in garages  
 or garages nearby.  There is a small  
 council house estate in Pelwood Road  
 and Saunders Way and Fleetway Court   
 are blocks of flats.  The most        
 desirable houses in Camber are on The 
 Suttons an unadopted road, these      
 houses  are larger and overlook the   
 sea and beach.                        </content>
