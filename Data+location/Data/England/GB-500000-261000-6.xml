      The flowers are grown in netting 
 so that they grow straight up, one    
 bloom to each square; the net is      
 raised as the flower grows.  Mr.      
 Wilkinson uses a lot of fertiliser    
 both in the soil and as liquid feeds. 
                                       
      Temperature is very important so 
 the greenhouses are heated by coal    
 burned in a huge boiler.  Seven crops 
 of each flower are grown every two    
 years.  Many colours of each flower   
 are grown but white is the most       
 popular.  They are used in flower     
 arrangements, bouquets and wreaths.   
 Mr. Wilkinson sells to 49 shops within
 a 39 mile radius; the rest go to      
 wholesale markets.  On the whole Mr.  
 Wilkinson enjoys his job.
