   My favourite music is played by a   
pop group called SISTER SLEDGE. I like 
them because they don't sing rubbish.  
There are four in the group, they wear 
very fashionable clothes. One lady has 
very long black hair, she wears black  
trousers with a white flimsy dress over
them. The others wear black or yellow  
trousers with flowery blouses.         
Sometimes they wear yellow coats. At   
the moment they are singing a song I   
like called "Frankie". I watch "Top of 
the Pops" on television every week to  
see  what the favourite song of the    
week is. I have a cassette player on   
which I listen to pop music, usually   
in my bedroom because my mum does not  
like    pop music.
