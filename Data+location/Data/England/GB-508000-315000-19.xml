		<title>19THE WOODS.</title>
		<content> There are three woods that we go into.
 Elsey,Park and Dole.In Elsey Wood are 
 rabbits,foxes,deer and many birds.Park
 Wood is cut in two by the new A15.In  
 all the woods are primroses but sprays
 drifting from the fields kill many of 
 the flowers.In the Spring there are a 
 lot of bluebells.Dole Wood was donated
 to the Lincolnshire Nature Trust by   
 Mr K.Stevenson.This is the most used  
 wood in Thurlby.The dead trees are cut
 down and new trees planted.Bird boxes 
 have been put on some trees.These are 
 some of the animals that you can see; 
 foxes,hares,rabbits,squirrels and     
 deer.The birds you can see are :Wren, 
 Woodpecker,Woodcock,Linnets,Pigeon,   
 Tits,Warblers,Thrushes,Tawny Owl and  
 Blackbirds.In all three woods all the 
 trees are deciduous.Looking after the 
 woods is very important for us and the
 animals.                              </content>
