		<title>05MY FIRST DAY AT A NEW SCHOOL</title>
		<content>My first day at secondary school was a 
very nerve-wracking one! I very much   
wished to be back at my junior school. 
  I arrived at King Edward VI          
Comprehensive School on Tuesday 4th    
September l984 and I was immediately   
terrified by the size of it! As I came 
from a school that was outside the     
catchment area,I knew nobody there! I  
walked around dodging anyone who came  
near me!                               
  One of the first things that we did  
was to go on a tour of the school and I
felt sure that I would never be able to
find my way around and would always be 
lost (although, in fact, I haven't been
lost yet, and i've nearly been here a  
year now!).                            
  The very first lesson we had was     
Science and we were given the "Rules of
the Laboratory" to learn. It was all   
very alarming and I was glad to go home</content>
