 one on the outskirts of Thornwood and 
 one near the M11 Roundabout at        
 Hastingwood.                          
 High Elms Nursery is the larger,      
 covering 8 hectares of flat land to   
 the North of Thornwood.It is visible  
 in the aerial view(photo 1). The owner
 and his family,who run the nursery,   
 produce a wide range of bedding plants
 and flowers for sale to passers by,   
 and also produce conifer trees.       
 Canes Nursery,near Hastingwood, is    
 also a family run business and while  
 producing flowers and bedding         
 plants,specialises in rose bushes.The 
 large amounts of water needed for this
 nursery are obtained from a private   
 borehole which takes water from       
 beneath the roundabout.
