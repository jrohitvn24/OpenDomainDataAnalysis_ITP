		<title>07VILLAGE LIFE IN 1985</title>
		<content>{Elston}and{East Stoke}exemplify the   
 contrast between the old and the more 
 recent style of village life. {East   
{Stoke}is the type of village that was 
 the norm in the past.  People tend to 
 live in the village all their lives;  
 many of them work on the land or      
 around the village and will remain    
 there when they retire. {Elston}is    
 typical of a modern commuter village. 
 Agriculture employs an insignificant  
 fraction of the working population.   
 The recently built housing has        
 resulted in an influx of new people to
 the village - some retired, but mostly
 managers, teachers and other          
 professionals employed in nearby towns
 such as{Newark}and{Nottingham.}These  
 incomers often play an active part in 
 village life, but the village is no   
 longer the centre of peoples' lives as
 it was in the past.                   </content>
