 or baggy jeans,and bold patterned     
 tops. The girls wear short skirts,and 
 the boys,wear trousers pleated around 
 the waistband. Fluorescent socks and  
 matching colour co_ordinated shoes are
 a must for "gear" as it is called.    
   Make-up is worn by girls. A wide    
 range can be bought in almost any     
 colour.Particularly popular, are gold 
 stick_on shapes for the eyes and      
 face.Fashionable hairstyles are       
 important too.                        
   Another feature is the jewellery    
 worn.Some boys and many girls have    
 pierced ears allowing them to wear a  
 variety of earrings which may be in   
 the shape of telephones,fruit,stars   
 and skeletons.Coloured bangles and    
 large beads are worn.
