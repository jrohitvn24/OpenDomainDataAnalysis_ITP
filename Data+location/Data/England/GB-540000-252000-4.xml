 their monuments are to be found in the
 chancel.During the 1870s,the          
 prosperity resulting from the         
 coprolite digging contributed to the  
 last major restoration of the whole   
 building.Notable among those who have 
 ministered here is Bishop Mackenzie,  
 who was curate-in-charge 1851-1855,   
 and led the first mission to Central  
 Africa,where he died of fever.There is
 a memorial window to him in the       
 church.
