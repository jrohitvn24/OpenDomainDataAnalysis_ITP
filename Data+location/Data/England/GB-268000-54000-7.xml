		<content> Area devoted almost entirely to agri- 
 culture mainly {DAIRY &amp; CATTLE} FARMS.
 Also some feedstock and much arable.  
 Farms vary from quite small to larger 
 acreage, mostly  run by a single      
 family with minimum of outside help,  
 usually part-time.  Some of these have
 remained in the same family ownership 
 for many years, but sadly, recent     
 economic depression has forced        
 transfer to new ownership, some       
 from outside the area.  Home life is  
 fairly simple, geared to the essential
 needs of farming community.  Many     
 people still find time for{hobbies}in 
 little spare time afforded after vital
 running of farms is dealt with. {     
{Reading}catered for and enjoyed by    
 many.  Most women are avid cooks, and 
  possibly some of the menfolk also.   
  Local craft skills are practised in  
 the homes whenever there is time.     </content>
