		<title>08CATFIELD CHURCH</title>
		<content> All Saints Church is situated on the  
 outskirts of Catfield, near the First 
 School. It is not supposed to have    
 been the centre of an earlier         
 settlement. It is mainly built of     
 flint with some areas of additional   
 brickwork. The churchyard is almost   
 entirely surrounded by a flint and    
 brick wall. The southern side of the  
 church, nearest to the rectory, is    
 cared for by the people of the        
 village, but the northern side has    
 been allowed to grow naturally.Inside 
 the church is a screen with painted   
 figures on it. On the walls above the 
 nave are the faint outlines of        
 medieval paintings. These used to be  
 covered in whitewash. The tower now   
 has six bells and there is a bell     
 ringing practice on Friday nights. The
 present rector is Mr Smith.
