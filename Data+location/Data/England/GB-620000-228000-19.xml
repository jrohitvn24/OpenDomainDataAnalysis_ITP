		<title>19The Guy Carnival</title>
		<content> Although it is not directly begun in  
 our grids,we felt that it was         
 important to mention one of the most  
 notable{local events}which takes part 
 in our area.                          
 This is the Guy carnival,which takes  
 place on the first Saturday before    
 November the Fifth,in memory of the   
 Gunpowder plot.                       
 It attracts thousands of people from  
 the surrounding districts,and features
 around 15 or 20 'floats' which are all
 constructed and planned in the period 
 just before the event.One of it's     
 reasons for such popularity,is that   
 each of the float's is based around a 
 topical event many of them local      
 matters of interest.                  
 Indeed there is also a magazine full  
 of{local opinions}and remarks which   
 are called{pithy parrs}and are pointed
 barbs aimed at someone locally.       </content>
