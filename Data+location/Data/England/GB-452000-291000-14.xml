		<title>14DAIRY FARMING</title>
		<content> When we arrived we saw the farmer     
{milk}the{cows}.First she pulled the   
 teats and squirted some milk,then she 
 rubbed some antiseptic on them so that
 no germs could get into the milk.Then 
 she gave the cows some cow cake and   
 put the suckers onto the teats.       
  When the small collecting tanks were 
 full the milk was transferred to two  
 larger tanks.The farmer went into her 
 house and fetched a mug so that we    
 could sample the milk if we wished to.
 The milk was warm and creamy.         
  After being interviewed she showed us
 some cow cake which I tasted.         
 It reminded me of my breakfast cereal.
 One boy in our class ran away when a  
 cow mooed.It was funny.               
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
