		<title>12WADDINGTON FARM, BLACKBURN</title>
		<content>      Waddington Farm, in the Livesey  
 area of Blackburn, has a riding school
 for the able-bodied and the disabled. 
 The school was established in 1960 and
 takes about 250 disabled pupils every 
 week.                                 
      The riding lessons for the       
 disabled are about 10 to 15 minutes   
 long and the ages of the children     
 taught range from 2 to 20. During a   
 lesson three people supervise each    
 horse to ensure the child's safety,   
 one person on either side of the horse
 and one at its head.                  
      Mencap, a charity for the        
 mentally handicapped, pays for some of
 the riding school's needs, for example
 the bridles. The horses are usually   
 bought from friends of the owner and  
 riding hats are bought second-hand    
 from the Police Force.
