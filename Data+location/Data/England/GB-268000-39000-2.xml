		<content>{BICYCLE RIDING}I like riding my bike  
 up and down Collaton Road.  I ride on 
 the grass in the park.  It is hard to 
 pedal because I have got no gears, and
 the grass is too long.                
{TAKING MY DOG PENNY FOR WALKS}We go   
 rabbiting with Penny and the gun, and 
 we take Penny for a walk.  We are not 
 allowed in the park because there is a
 sign saying "No Dogs". Penny is a     
 cross between an alsation and a       
 collie.  She is black and brown and   
 white.                                
{HELPING DAD}I help polish Dad's motor 
 bike and I had a go on it after       
 school. I got on the back and Dad went
 around the garden.  He put on his back
 brake and Dad did a skid just before  
 we turned the corner to go to the     
 shed. The motor bike is green and     
 black. I live in{Jubilee Road,        
{Malborough.}I am ten years old.       </content>
