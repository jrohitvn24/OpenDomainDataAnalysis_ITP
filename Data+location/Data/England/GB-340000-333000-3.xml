		<content> My name is Kay,my surname is Adams.I  
 live with my family at Hampton Bank.We
 live on a Dairy farm.There are five   
 people in my family my                
 mother,father,Mark and Ruth.I am      
 ten,Mark is sixteen and Ruth is       
 fourteen.Mark goes to work,Ruth goes  
 to Ellesmere Secondary school and I go
 to Welshampton Primary school.We all  
 have meals together.Sometimes in the  
 summer I don't see my brother a lot.  
 We all get on well.My father works on 
 the farm with my grandfather.My mother
 is a housewife and helps with the     
 farm.On Saturday I sometimes go with  
 my father on a bike ride.On Sundays we
 go to chapel,that is Sunday School,and
 as a family we sometimes go to church.
 We also run a caravan site,which is   
 for Caravan Club members,in a field   
 near our house.
