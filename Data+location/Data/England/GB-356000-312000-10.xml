		<content> RODDINGTON STORES IS THE LOCAL SHOP   
 AND POST OFFICE. IT WAS BUILT IN 1926 
 AND THE SHOP AREA IS TWICE AS BIG NOW 
 AS IT WAS THEN. THE GREATER PART OF   
 THE BUILDING IS THE SHOPKEEPER'S HOME.
 THE SHOP OPENS FROM 8 A.M. TILL 6 P.M.
 DAILY EXCEPT SUNDAY, WHEN IT IS CLOSED
 ALL DAY, AND THURSDAY WHEN IT CLOSES  
 AT 12.30 P.M.                         
 THE VILLAGE SHOP SELLS JUST ABOUT     
 EVERYTHING. YOU WALK IN AND YOU ARE   
 MET WITH A COLOURFUL SELECTION OF     
 SWEETS, CAKES, POP, CHOCOLATES,       
 NEWSPAPERS AND MAGAZINES.  STRAIGHT IN
 FRONT OF YOU IS THE POST OFFICE       
 COUNTER.  TO THE LEFT OF YOU IS THE   
 MAIN COUNTER AND TO THE RIGHT OF YOU  
 IS THE AREA OF THE SHOP WHICH IS      
 DEVOTED TO SELF-SERVICE ITEMS. THE    
 SHOP STOCKS A VAST RANGE OF ITEMS FROM
 CAT FOOD AND CLEANERS TO BOTTLES OF
