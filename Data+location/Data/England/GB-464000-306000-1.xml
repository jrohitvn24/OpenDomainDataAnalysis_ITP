		<content> This area contains mainly grade two   
 agricultural land. There are more than
 nine farms in the area including a{   
{pick your own}farm (Spring Grange     
 Farm) specialising in soft fruit.     
 There are only two main settlements   
 in their own right - both small       
 villages.{Beeby}contains less than    
 fifteen houses and{Keyham}has fifty   
 two. Beeby is a{working village}and   
 has the feel of a farming community.  
 Keyham, on the other hand, is very    
 much a{commuter village}- most of its 
 inhabitants who work travel to        
 Leicester each day. In fact there are 
 6 medical doctors living there.       
 In the south-west corner of the area  
 is part of the{Netherhall Estate,}    
 Leicester. This is a large{council}   
 estate. The area in and around square 
 5 is called{Hamilton}after the village
 which disappeared during{The Plague.  </content>
