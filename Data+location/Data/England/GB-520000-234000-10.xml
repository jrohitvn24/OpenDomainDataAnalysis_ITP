		<title>10Our May Revels.</title>
		<content> It is our tradition to have{May Revels
 every year.At this ceremony there is a
 May Queen and a Green King who watch  
 all kinds of dancing including:       
{Maypole,Morris and other country      
{dances }.All the children's Mums      
 and Dads come to watch and to buy from
 the many stalls.Maybe their child is  
 one of the May Queen's attendants or  
 even the Queen herself.Years ago this 
 ceremony was carried out by the local 
 secondary school and when they could  
 no longer do this my school,          
{St.Nicholas J.M.I.}carried on         
 the tradition.This May I felt very    
 nervous because I was the May Queen   
 for 1985 and when I had the crown put 
 on my head I was worried that it might
 fall off.After it was all over I felt 
 better and very proud.I wish good luck
 to all the May Queens and Green Kings 
 that follow me. By Niki Redding.      </content>
