 used by people who play cricket.Many  
 people like to go swimming at the     
 local Ashton swimming baths.A lot of  
 girls go roller-skating at Wheels and

 tennis on Store Street Park.Nearly    
 every boy enjoys Breakin and Poppin   
 and if they really like it they go to 
 a club called Street Life which is    
 based in Oldham.Rounders is very      
 popular in schools.Fishing is not very
