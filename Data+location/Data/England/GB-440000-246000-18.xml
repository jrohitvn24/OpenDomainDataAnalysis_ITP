		<title>18The Obelisk</title>
		<content> This is a Large "{CLEOPATRA's Needle" 
 type Obelisk placed at the most       
 Southerly point of the nearby         
 Farnborough Hall's garden.It is a     
 landmark,visible for several          
 miles around and from most points in  
 this grid section.                    
 The surrounding gardens are formally  
 laid out and bordered by Laurel       
 bushes,below which is a retaining wall
 of Limestone supporting the bank      
 upon which the Obelisk stands.        
 Over the years this has become a      
 favourite visiting place for Village  
 yougsters,who have inscribed their    
 names and initials on it for          
 posterity.                            
 It is believed to have been erected   
 in 1847 to commemorate the completion 
 of the construction of the picturesque
 garden walkway at nearby Farnborough  
 Hall.                                 </content>
