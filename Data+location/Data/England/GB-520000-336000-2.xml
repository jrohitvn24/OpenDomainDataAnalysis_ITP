 Claire, a first year at Cowley's      
 secondary school in Donington, starts 
 her day at 5.00 am by helping her dad 
 hoe his field of sugar beet.After     
 breakfast she has to travel 2 miles   
 into school on the school bus.        
 At school she meets her friends and   
 joins the rest of the 560 pupils.     
                                       
 After registration the first lesson is
 French followed by Geography and      
 Science.Soon it is lunch and time for 
 chips and a stroll round school before
 English and RE.                       
                                       
 At home in the evening she watches a  
 video and plays tennis before getting 
 ready for bed.
