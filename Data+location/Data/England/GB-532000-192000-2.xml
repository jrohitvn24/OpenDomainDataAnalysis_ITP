 The focal point of our area is        
 Edmonton Green,an enclosed square     
 where greengrocers have their stalls. 
 As you walk round you can hear the    
 stallholders shouting to advertise    
 their wares.Around the square are     
 supermarkets and smaller shops. On    
 Friday evenings my Dad buys fruit and 
 vegetables at the stalls and on       
 Thursday  evening my parents get the  
 week's food supply in Sainsburys.     
 There is a joke shop which sells      
 masks,wigs, sneezing powder and things
 to make people laugh. There is also an
 amusement arcade where young people   
 put money in a slot machine to get a  
 picture on the screen to start        
 playing the game. It is very good fun 
 but a waste of money.
