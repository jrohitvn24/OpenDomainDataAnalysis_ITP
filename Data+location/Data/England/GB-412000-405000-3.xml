 The{flood}started in{1852}when the    
 Bilberry Reservoir burst and washed   
 away Digley Mill. The big chimney was 
 left but later it was knocked down    
 because it was dangerous. It flooded  
 right down to Holmfirth. It washed    
 down to Holmbridge church and         
 the bodies floated down the valley.   
 An old lady knew the flood was coming,
 she put her wire rimmed glasses in    
 her bible. The bible is in the        
 Holmbridge Parish Church and the mark 
 of the glasses can be seen.           
 The flood caused a lot of people to   
 loose their lives, also a lot of farm 
 land was destroyed. 81 people died    
 in the disaster flood and 7,000 people
 were out of a job. On Waterside Lane  
 20 people died .
