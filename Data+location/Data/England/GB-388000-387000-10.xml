		<title>10STOCKPORT COUNTY A.F.C.</title>
		<content> Stockport County is a very small      
 football club and its ground is called
{Edgeley Park.}Although the ground     
 holds many more, the average crowd for
 a home game is about 2000. At the     
 moment they are in the{Fourth Division
 of the{Football League.}The ground has
 very many rooms. The medical room is  
 very important for injured            
 footballers. In the dressing rooms of 
 the home team they have a big sunken  
 bath with fitted showers but in the   
 visiting team's rooms the bath is     
 smaller and they have fewer showers.  
 The team has some fairly good players 
 in it, although at the moment the club
 is not having much success. Now that  
 the football season has ended, a lot  
 of work is taking place at the club,  
 such as redecorating and general      
 ground repairs on the stands and      
 terraces.                             </content>
