This area of the rural-urban fringe of 
{IPSWICH} is rich in sporting          
facilities. The {Northgate} Sports     
Centre contains a floodlit             
international athletics track, tennis, 
squash and badminton courts and even a 
floodlit 'PETANQUE' area. It is part of
Ipswich Borough Council's Recreation   
and Amenities Department and is heavily
used by people of Ipswich.             
Other important sports facilities      
include rugby clubs, large Ipswich     
companies' sports grounds and other    
open spaces for football and cricket.  
Much of this sporting land was until   
recently farmalnd but with the increase
in leisure time, more of this land on  
the fringes of the town is being turned
to recreational use.
