		<title>16 TALKS WITH LOCAL PEOPLE</title>
		<content>  Rockhampton in 1985 had its bus      
service wihdrawn,so to take its place  
a mini-bus was sent every week on a    
certain day to take people to Bristol. 
This did not affect many people as they
mostly had their own cars. It was found
that most people in Rockhampton shopped
for large items in Bristol and used the
local shop for small items. If the     
people of Rockhampton wished to do     
sport and swim they could go to the    
Sports Centre in Thornbury where they  
could take part in squash,tennis,      
badminton,weight training,bowls,       
swimming,snooker or have a sauna.      
Cricket was played in Rockhampton on   
the Cricket Green. The people          
interviewed all worked locally,one was 
self-employed,one was a farrier,and one
was a housewife. Each liked the area   
and found it clean and interesting.
