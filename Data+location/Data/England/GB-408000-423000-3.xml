{SHIBDEN HALL}is a timbered house with 
 a 19th century tower.In the 15th      
 century all the houses were built of  
 oak.The roof was covered with stone   
 slates and moss packed into the       
 joints.The moss soaked up the         
 rainwater like a sponge and expanded  
 to make the roof watertight.          
                                       
 In{THE BOROUGH MARKET}there is a      
 plaque made of marble stating that the
 building was constructed between 6th  
 October 1892 and July 1896.The Duke   
 and Duchess of York opened it on July 
 25th 1896.The market is open 6 days a 
 week from 9am till 5.30pm.
