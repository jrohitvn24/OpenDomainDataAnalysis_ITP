		<content>    A Livery of 30 horses and a Riding 
School have been established on one of 
the D-K Farms at Lane End.This is an   
alternative use of land as the EEC is  
encouraging farmers not to grow so much
food.3 of the horses which the children
of the Suter Family at Church Farm used
to ride are now retained for the use of
young disabled riders.                 
    Only Downley Farm fattens up       
piglets for pork production.           
    Church Farm has 1000 free-range    
hens,mostly hybrid which produce a     
brown shelled egg.They keep a few Light
Sussex and some speciality breeds-Black
and Buff Orpington and Cochin from     
Andalusia for interest.Downley Farm's  
100 hens are also free-range.Both farms
find a ready market for their eggs     
amongst the local community as they are
preferred to those produced by battery 
hens.                                  </content>
