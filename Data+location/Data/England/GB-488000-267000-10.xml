		<title>10CROYLAND PARK AMENITIES</title>
		<content> Croyland Park is a large expanse of   
 grass with a stream running through it
 which is presently being modified by  
 workmen. Nearby there is a large      
 indoor swimming pool which is very    
 popular amongst the residents of      
 Wellingborough. A good quality        
 football pitch, with changing rooms,  
 can also be found there.              
 Although there are playground         
 facilities for children there are few 
 amenities for adult recreation and    
 this is demonstrated by two           
 delapidated and unusable tennis       
 courts.                               
 Overall, Croyland Park provides       
 adequate recreational services to most
 of Wellingborough and, as the main    
 park in the town, it is a pleasant and
 quiet area.
