		<title>11Spitals Cross Housing Est. 1</title>
		<content>Most inhabitants of the Spitals Cross  
Estate situated near the North end of  
Edenbridge, Kent are either unemployed 
or on a low wage. Perhaps due to this  
fact many of them rent their homes.    
Many have lived in their terraced homes
for more than five years and, in one   
case, 15 years. Most people or their   
families originate from London and the 
surrounding areas. The two main reasons
moving were bigger houses and to be    
nearer to relatives. Although there are
many factories in the estate very few  
actually work in them. Others either   
drive or walk to a local job in the    
surrounding areas. Some travel by train
to London. There are not many garages  
and parking facilities on the estate   
but there are many cars. Not all of    
which are privately owned as some are  
company cars distributed by local      
firms.                                 </content>
