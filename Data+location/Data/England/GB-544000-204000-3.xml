		<title>03HALEYS MANOR FARM</title>
		<content> Hayleys Manor farm is in the southern 
 part of our area and covers nearly 500
 hectares of land.It is owned by Mr.   
 Peter Padfield,whose relatives own    
 many of the local farms.The land was  
 once farmed by his parents,but they   
 have now taken a smaller farm while   
 Hayleys has been expanded and is run  
 with another five local farms.        
 Mr Padfield uses most of the land for 
 arable farming,but a little is used   
 for his herd of 800 pedigree dairy    
 Friesians on which he is recognised   
 as an expert:the week before our visit
 he was away in Germany judging and    
 advising on the breed.                
 There are three ponds outside the     
 farmhouse,used mostly for water       
 storage,but also to encourage water   
 birds and keep fish.The farm has its  
 own borehole used for farm water      
 supply,and to top up the ponds.       </content>
