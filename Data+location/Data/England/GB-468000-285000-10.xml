{ St.Nicholas Church,Marston Trussell  
 was originally built in{13th centry}in
 sandstone.The site is believed to date
 back to Roman times.The{tower,}71 feet
 high,was built about{1525}and has 5   
 bells now rung by 1 man and 4 women.  
 The{porch}is made from{oak}possibly   
 part of a{Danish Ship.}Part of the    
 nearby{castle}was also used,only the  
 moat and mound can still be seen.There
 have been 35 priests since the church 
 was built.There has been only one     
 christening in the last 5 years.      
  At the{Battle of Naseby}King         
 Charles' Cavaliers made their last    
 stand against Cromwell's men and were 
 defeated.The ones that broke away     
 from the battle retreated towards     
 Leicester but many were cornered  at  
 'Pudding Poke Marston',slaughtered    
 and buried near the church yard.      </content>
