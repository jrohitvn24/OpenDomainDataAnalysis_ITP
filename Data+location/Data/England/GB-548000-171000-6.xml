		<content>   Housing in Bexley show part of it's 
 History. There are houses which were  
 built in the Victorian age and even   
 some from before that. Some of the    
 victorian houses are large and are    
 either detached or semi-detached. Some
 have four floors which include a      
 cellar and attic where maids would    
 sleep. Other victorian houses were not
 for the rich people but for the       
 workers. These are terraced. There are
 Alms houses in Bexley which date from 
 1755 and which are being renovated.   
 There are many other houses which were
 built either side of the 2nd World    
 War. These are usually semi-detached  
 houses or bungalows. Recently some old
 large houses have been demolished and 
 flats or link houses built on the     
 land. Much more modern houses, with   
 modern facilities can also be found.
