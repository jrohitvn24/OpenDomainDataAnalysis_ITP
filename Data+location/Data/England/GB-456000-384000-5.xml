		<title>05T.V AND BOOKS IN CARLTON</title>
		<content> Quite  a lot of time in the day is    
 taken up watching television.Nearly   
 everyone in our class watched five to 
 eight hours nearly{every day}! We seem
 to like boisterous programmes or      
 murders. Sometimes we take it too much
 for granted.We get home,walk in switch
 on and settle down for hours.{I think 
{there should be less violence on      
{television,which provokes young       
{children because they beleve most of  
{it and think it's real life and copy  
{what they see.}The children in our    
 school read alot. Most people read{1-3
{hours}a day.We seem to like books     
 where silly or foolish thing          
 happen.The things people like reading 
 most are things like{"The Twits"}and  
 "Georges{Marvellous Medicine". }I     
 like animal books like{"Jinny"}books.
