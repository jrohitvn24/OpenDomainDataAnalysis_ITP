		<title>17Life of a soldier's child.</title>
		<content> There are two{army barracks}in Windsor
 and the{soldiers' families}live in    
 West Windsor. If your father is in the
 army, you live in all sorts of        
 different places.                     
{  I was born}on 29th June 1976, in    
 Aldershot Military Hospital. My daddy 
 is a sergeant in the 1st Battalion    
 Grenadier Guards. He guards Windsor   
 Castle, Buckingham Palace, St. James' 
 Palace and the Tower of London.       
   We will be going to live in{Munster,
{West Germany}in February 1986. We have
 lived in{Berlin}and we used to visit  
{East Berlin.}You need an identity card
 to go there because of the wall that  
 separates East from West. It is called
 the{Berlin Wall.}In East Berlin we    
 visited{Trepton Park,}where many      
 Russian soldiers, who died in the war,
 are buried.                           
                                       </content>
