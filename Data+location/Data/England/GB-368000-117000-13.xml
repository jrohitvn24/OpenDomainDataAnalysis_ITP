		<title>13A Policeman's Day</title>
		<content> The local policeman's beat covers a   
 vast area where as 100 years ago over 
 30 men did the same job.Therefor he   
 spends a great deal of time in his car
 travelling around the area.The day can
 start at any time and there are no    
 true days off for a country policeman.
 He lives at the police house in       
 Milborne Port and feels that a vital  
 part of his job is the public         
 relations work he has to do.He visits 
 local school to talk about crime,road 
 safety and the policeman's work.He    
 recently organised a visit to the     
 local schools by the Yeovil Task      
 Force.                                
 Crimes in the area vary from assault  
 to poaching and there are a number of 
 traffic control problems on the A30   
 particularly during the holiday       
 season.                               
                                       </content>
