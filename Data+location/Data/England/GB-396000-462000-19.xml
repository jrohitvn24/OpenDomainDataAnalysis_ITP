		<title>19SHOPPING IN THRESHFIELD</title>
		<content> Although the population of{Threshfield
 has grown over the years from being a 
 community solely made up of the native
 farming community to one containing   
 people from a wide variety of         
 backgrounds, with a resultant wide    
 variety of shopping needs, the        
 facilities for fulfilling these needs 
 locally has not grown with the        
 population increase.                  
 To date{(25.7.85.)}there is only one  
 local general store and while this    
 seeks to provide as wide a range of   
 merchandise as possible it is usually 
 limited to consumables.Even this is   
 undertaken with some difficulty       
 because of competition from large     
{Supermarkets}in the urban areas.The   
 local shop cannot compete with the    
 prices offered by these Supermarkets  
 and so frequently changes hands       
 because of the lack of profit.        </content>
