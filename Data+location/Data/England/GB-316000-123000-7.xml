		<content>   An abattoir and tannery flanked the 
 mediaeval 3-arched Hele bridge which  
 has been reinforced, but disfigured by
 iron girders.                         
   Most of the fields around the river 
 have been harvested recently and      
 farmers have taken care to plough the 
 outer 10 metres of field prior to     
 burning off the stubble.              
   Extensive recent repairs and        
 clearing of the river to relieve      
 flooding was evident here although the
 areas of leats, sluices and weirs     
 were seen to remind us of the past    
 importance of mills in the area,      
 first for 'knapping' cloth and then   
 for grinding corn.  Our walk finished 
 at one preserved in remarkable        
 condition at Longaller Farm where we  
 were welcomed by a large heron seated 
 high in a tree above the weir.
