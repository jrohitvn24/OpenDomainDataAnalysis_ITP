		<content> This impressive Victorian mansion     
 stands in seventeen acres of gardens  
 and woods, and is in the heart of the 
 best of Lancashire's countryside. It  
 was designed by Alfred Waterhouse for 
 Colonel Bird the local Squire and his 
 wife. They lived in it until the      
 Colonel's death in l909. Subsequently 
 it was let to the Henrique family, the
 Carrington family and eventually to   
 Liverpool Corporation in l940 as an   
 evacuation centre"for 29 M.D. pupils".
 It is now a residential School for    
 children with special needs. Crookhey 
 was recently designated  a listed     
 building, and the craftmanship of both
 wood and stone fully justify this     
 inclusion. The number of pupils in    
 residence has fallen over the years   
 and closure was mooted. However,as    
 there are few schools of this type,   
 sanity prevailed and it was reprieved.</content>
