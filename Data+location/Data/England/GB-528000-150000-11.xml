		<title>11OAKLEY NATURE TRAIL</title>
		<content>{because you trip people over.People   
{give up Judo because it is rough.I    
{wouldn't give it up because it        
{protects you.I like throws,but holds  
{are better because they can't get out.
 A NATURE TRAIL is being set up by     
 Julia Wycherley who is studying the   
 environmental effect of the adjacent  
 M25.She feels we are wardens for the  
 next generation.we should develop the 
 children's awareness and help them    
 continue to preserve it.{A lady showed
{us some trees and a pond.Ifound Scots 
{pine cones.They are prickly.It is     
{called OAKLEY because it has lots of  
{oak trees.Isaw Spruce cones.When open 
{it means sunshine,when shut rain.A    
{cone had a bit of sticky glue called  
{amber.When the seed is growing it     
{developes a little wing.I saw a pine, 
{beech,oak,horse chestnut with conkers.
{I found an interesting bit of wood.   </content>
