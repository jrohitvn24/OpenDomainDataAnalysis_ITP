		<title>03MODERN HOUSING IN RUISLIP</title>
		<content>  I live on the new Lovell Estate built
 on the Glacier Sports Club. My Chesham
 style house is where the swimming pool
 was.It has 3 bedrooms, kitchen, dining
 room and bathroom.I think these houses
 are quite small compared with most    
 local houses.They don't seem to be    
 built as well as the 1940's           
 houses.They had little time to dry out
 properly and there are cracks in the  
 plaster.The partioning plasterboard   
 walls are not as strong as the older  
 houses walls. The new houses come with
 more modern conveniences like ample   
 power points, telephone and T.V.      
 points, insulation and central        
 heating. 40 years ago a garage was an 
 extra but is now part of the house.In 
 my opinion houses today meet today's  
 needs, but are built too quickly.     
 Another new estate with distinctive   
 blue roofs is called Legoland locally.</content>
