		<title>17MEMORIES OF NATLAND.</title>
		<content>{ }Mr. Charnley is a long-standing     
 resident of{Natland.}Like his         
 grandmother before him, he was married
 in the village. His great-grandfather 
 is buried in the churchyard.          
  Children from{St. Mark's}interviewed}
 him on his memories of Natland.       
  The green, he feels, is what has     
 changed most; when he first arrived in
 1940 it was played on much more than  
 today. The older{houses}he says have  
 changed very little, but having       
 witnessed the arrival of the newer    
 houses and estates, he maintains they 
 spoil Natland as a village. Although  
 he concedes that it is a much tidier  
 place now than it was forty-five      
 years ago, Mr. Charnley prefers the   
 'old' Natland.                        
  He enjoys all the children who live  
 in the village because they keep him  
 entertained!                          </content>
