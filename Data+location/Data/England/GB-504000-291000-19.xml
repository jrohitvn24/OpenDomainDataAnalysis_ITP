Brief Historical details of the area:- 
Warmington Church,  dedicated  to Saint
Mary, dates  back to  the 12th. century
and has some fine dog tooth carving, an
excellent example of a rood  screen and
the finest examples of a broached spire
for many miles.                        
The Manor House  dates  from  the 17th.
Century.                               
The  School  was built in 1873, and the
Methodist Chapel  and the new  vicarage
in the 1880's.                         
In Fotheringhay the church is part of a
much larger former building.           
Here also is a  remnant  of the  Castle
