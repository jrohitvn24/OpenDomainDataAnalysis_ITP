		<content>  PREVIOUSLY KNOWN AS WICK FARM,       
{MONKSLEY BOARDING KENNELS}STILL FARMS 
 61 ACRES OF LAND. 39 ACRES ARE FOR    
 WINTER BARLEY, 4 ARE FOR HAY, AND THE 
 REST IS FOR GRAZING FOR THE 34 COWS   
 AND CALVES. OTHER LIVESTOCK INCLUDES  
 PEACOCKS, GUINEA FOWL, A GOAT, GEESE  
 AND CHICKENS.                         
  THE KENNELS ARE KNOWN FOR BREEDING   
 ALSATIONS, AND THE DOGS GO TO POLICE  
 FORCES AROUND THE WORLD. THEY HAVE    
 BEEN PLACED IN TRINIDAD, SWEDEN,      
 AMERICA AND GERMANY, AMONG OTHERS.    
 THERE ARE ALSO FACILITIES FOR DOGS AND
 CATS TO BE LOOKED AFTER WHEN THEIR    
 OWNERS GO ON HOLIDAY.                 
  THE HOUSE ITSELF IS A 13th CENTURY   
 FARMHOUSE BELONGING TO FARLEIGH       
 CASTLE, AND THE LOUNGE STILL CONTAINS 
 SOME VERY OLD BEAMS. FROM HERE, THERE 
 WAS A PASSAGE LEADING TO THE CASTLE,  
 BUT IT HAS BEEN BLOCKED UP.           </content>
