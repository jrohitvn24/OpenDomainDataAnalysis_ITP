		<title>14The Thrift Wood</title>
		<content> Over many years the{ecology}of the    
 area has changed. Much of the area    
 was{woodland}but it has been          
 cleared for{farming.}The Thrift which 
 was originally part of the Feckenham  
 Forest, is the{woodland}plantation    
 that belongs to the Bentley Manor     
 estate. Many of the trees are oak. It 
 is in the process of being cleared.   
 Some of the wood from the Thrift is   
 being sent to repair{York Minster     
 which was damaged by fire.It is the   
 intention to replant fir trees after  
 the area has been cleared.
