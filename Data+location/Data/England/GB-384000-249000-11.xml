		<title>11INDUSTRY AROUND KEMPSEY.</title>
		<content>   Industry in North Kempsey consists  
 only of a sawmill/timber yard, a      
 nursery and Astons coach company.     
   The sawmill has been in business for
 about 20 years and manufactures       
 various items such as farm fencing,   
 gates, and other useful pieces of     
 work. The mill is split up into two   
 different businesses, a pine factory, 
 and a timber yard. Nine people        
 altogether are employed. Four work in 
 the pine factory, and make furniture  
 such as chairs, tables, and cupboards,
 and three are employed in the timber  
 yard making general building material.
   The timber yard has been in business
 since March 1985 and seems to be doing
 reasonably well. A reason for this is 
 that they are not simply producing    
 timber for local agricultural needs   
 but are also supplying local industry 
 and home needs as well.               </content>
