		<content>   The St Michael's Mount Community    
 Centre is in St Michael's Road. All   
 sorts  of different things go on there
 from a playgroup to martial arts.     
   My Mum is Warden there. She arranges
 the bookings for the hall,the Oxley   
 Room (a kind of sitting room),the     
 Committee room and the kitchen. She   
 arranges the bookings so they do not  
 clash and so there is enough time     
 in between for cleaning. She has to go
 on Sundays to open up for the         
 Jehovah's Witnesses.   Some of the    
 things that go on there are : Bingo,  
 aerobics, all kinds of Karate, play-  
 group, baby clinic, mother and toddler
 group, birthday, wedding and christen-
 ing parties. There are 2 store rooms, 
 1 Committee room,1 Office, 1 Hall, 1  
 kitchen, the Oxley Room, a foyer and a
 shop.
