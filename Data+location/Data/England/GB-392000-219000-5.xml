		<content> I go to Christ Church Primary school. 
 It is over one hundred years old and  
 has about two hundred pupils. Every   
 year we have a school play and most of
 the juniors take part in it. We have a
 swimming gala, Christmas party and at 
 the end of term we have a disco and   
 leavers party. On Wednesdays different
 classes do an assembly for the rest of
 school. We have a hamster and a       
 Rabbit.                               
 On certain days there are after school
 activities.On Thursdays there is a    
 Dance Club,on Mondays Gymnastics and  
 on Tuesdays drama.On Fridays in the   
 morning we go swimming.We have eight  
 classes,one for each year.Near the    
 canteen we have a pond and every year 
 we have frogs.At the top of the road  
 is a Church where we go for services  
 and some of us go to choir.
