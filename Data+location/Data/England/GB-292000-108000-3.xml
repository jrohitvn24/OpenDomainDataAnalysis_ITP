		<content> The majority of trees are{deciduous   
 e.g. Oak, Ash, Beech and Wild Cherry. 
 Unfortunately, the Elm has almost     
 vanished due to the Dutch Elm Disease 
 spread by the Elm Bark Beetle.{       
{Evergreens}are mainly Larch. Bluebells
 and Primroses abound in the woods, but
 the Marsh Marigold has almost         
 disappeared. Campions, Foxgloves and  
 Cow Parsley grow in profusion in the  
 lanes. Many lovely Roe Deer roam in   
 the woods. Foxes are increasing and   
 there are several large Badger        
 colonies, and plenty of Rabbits       
 despite Myxomatosis. There are more   
 Sparrow Hawks in the district - but   
 fewer Owls and Skylarks. We are       
 inundated with Magpies, and Wrens seem
 to be on the increase - which is      
 pleasing.
