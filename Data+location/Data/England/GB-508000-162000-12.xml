		<title>12Children's Games-Conkers</title>
		<content> by Ron McGinn                         
 Conkers are the strong nut fruit which
 are produced by the horse-chestnut    
 tree.                                 
 A hole is drilled through the conker, 
 a string threaded throughthe hole, and
 a knot tied at the end.               
 Two players compete, and each try to  
 break the other opponent's conker by  
 swinging his conker at the other      
 conker, now hanging from the other    
 person's hand, as hard as he can.     
 A conker can be made stronger by      
 soaking it in vinegar and leaving it  
 in the sun, or by cooking it in the   
 oven for two minutes.                 
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
