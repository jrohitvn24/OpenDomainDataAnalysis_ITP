		<title>01ASHRIDGE ESTATE</title>
		<content>  The twelve kilometre squares we were 
 given for our project contains much of
 the Ashridge Estate which is          
 maintained by the National Trust. It  
 is one of the lovely wooded estates of
 the Chiltern Hills and has many       
 historical connections.               
  The only settlement of any size is   
 the village of Aldbury the other      
 building being Ashridge itself the    
 former stately home of the Dukes of   
 Bridgwater and now a Management       
 College.                              
  Woodlands cover the vast majority of 
 all but two squares and the most      
 common tree is the beech. There is    
 some farming which will be included   
 and a visit to the village school at  
 Aldbury.
