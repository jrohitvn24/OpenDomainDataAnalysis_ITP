		<title>11THE GRAVEL WORKS.</title>
		<content>   Half a mile or so North-East of     
 Little Houghton there is an{aggregate 
{works.}The aggregate is used in four  
 different ways:_ (a) concrete,        
 (b) mortar, (c) ashfelt, (d) drainage.
   They have been digging at Little    
 Houghton for almost{50 years.}The     
 material extracted is a 60:40 mix of  
 sand and gravel which is found 2      
 metres below the surface to a further 
 depth of{2 metres.}On average 40      
 tonnes of material can be removed each
 hour.                                 
   The sand and gravel is sold in      
 pre-packed bags that start at 5 kg.   
 The works are noisy and there is a    
{hard hat area.}Lorries periodically   
 appear clanking along a lane that     
 shows the strain of heavy use. A      
{weighbridge}on site checks lorries on 
 and off adjacent to a group of        
 pre-fabricated office buildings.      </content>
