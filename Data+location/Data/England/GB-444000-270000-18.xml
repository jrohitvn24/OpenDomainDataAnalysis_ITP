		<content>Most people in the Thurlaston area     
seem to attend either the Church       
of England or the Methodist church.    
Half the people interviewed attended   
church regularly. Some knew their      
clergy personally,most liked their own 
church. Some villagers had been going  
to the same church for over 40 years.  
The Baptist church was built in the    
1830's on the boundary between         
villages to avoid hostility. Sunday    
services last an hour. There is also a 
coffee morning,youth club,study        
group,sunday school and musical group  
during the week.About 70 people attend 
each service and about $80 is          
collected. Babies and childen are not  
christened but adults are fully        
submerged. The church has a graveyard. 
Once a year a church camp is           
organised. The church publish a        
magazine.                              </content>
