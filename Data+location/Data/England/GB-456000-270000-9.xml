		<content>   Both the schools in Kilsby and Crick
 have a{Harvest Festival.}This is held 
 in the Autumn term and children bring 
 all kinds of fruit and vegetables to  
 thank God for a good harvest.         
 Afterwards the produce is distributed 
 among the old people of the villages. 
   Many years ago people used to cut   
 the corn and wheat with sickles and   
 scythes.Today we have big combine     
 harvesters. These are huge machines   
 which not only cut the corn but thresh
 and bag the grain as well. All this is
 done by one man working the machine   
 instead of 3 or 4 men doing different 
 jobs.                                 
{May Day}Normally May Day festivities  
 are held on May 1st.The children in   
 school vote for the May Queen,the     
 Herald and the attendants.On the day  
 the Queen is crowned,music is played  
 and everyone dances around the Maypole</content>
