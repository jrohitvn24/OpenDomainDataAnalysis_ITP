		<title>09LIFE IN MILDENHALL</title>
		<content>{Interviews with children who live     
{there produced this description of the
{village of Mildenhall _               
 "Mildenhall is a very quiet village   
 with no heavy traffic going through it
 as most cars bypass the village on the
 A4.The village has a post office and  
 one general store but most people go  
 into the nearby town of Marlborough to
 do their shopping.There are no schools
 in the village so children also go to 
 Marlborough to school, but the village
 does have its own church.Most people  
 from the village work locally, either 
 in Marlborough or on the local farms, 
 though some do commute to Swindon.    
 There is a pub in the village called  
 'The Horseshoe'.Mildenhall does have a
 village hall which used to be the     
 centre for village activities, but    
 unfortunately it has been closed as it
 was judged to be unsafe.              </content>
