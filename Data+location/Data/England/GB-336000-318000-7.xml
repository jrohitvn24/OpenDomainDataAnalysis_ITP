		<title>07HOLLY HOUSE FARM, NESSCLIFFE</title>
		<content> Holly House Farm used to be a         
 virtually derelict three storey       
 property with outbuildings built out  
 of local materials. For many years it 
 was a thriving workplace but is now   
 mainly residential. In the field which
 adjoins the old farmhouse is a pool of
 0_178 hectares, this has been allowed 
 to revert to its natural state and    
 provides a secure wilderness and      
 breeding ground for moorhens, ducks,  
 geese, visiting swans and aquatic     
 creatures also a wide variety of      
 insect_life. We are a family of four  
 and moved here from Alberbury.
