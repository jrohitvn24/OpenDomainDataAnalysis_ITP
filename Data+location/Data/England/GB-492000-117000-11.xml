		<title>11A GRAFFHAM HEALTH VISITOR</title>
		<content> Our Visitor has been a nurse for 20   
 years &amp; has worked with children for 2
 years.She decided to be a nurse ever  
 since she was a child &amp; trained for 3 
 years.She cares for children from 5-18
 years &amp; sometimes delivers babies if  
 the mums want to have them at home.   
 When she visits schools she checks our
 hair for headlice,helps the school    
 doctor at medicals &amp; carries out      
 hearing &amp; sight tests with special    
 equipment.When a baby has been born   
 she visits to make sure the new mum   
 can cope &amp; to weigh &amp; measure them.The
 only real emergencies are when an old 
 person collapses.If the old people    
 suffer in the winter all the nurses   
 help by getting blankets from the Red 
 Cross.They also help them in their    
 homes so they don't go into old       
 people's homes, run a service so they 
 can travel to a centre &amp; meet others. </content>
