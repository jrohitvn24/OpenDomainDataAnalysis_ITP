		<title>14Local Transport</title>
		<content> The main method of transport in the   
 area is by road, either in cars or    
 buses. Half the area is served by a   
 bus service but in the rural areas the
 private car is the only means of      
 travel. Many people own a car as      
 public transport is limited. The      
 Inter-City trains do travel through   
 the area but do not stop; but if      
 required one can be boarded at St.    
 Austell. These trains travel from     
 London to Penzance. Many children own 
 a bicycle and can be seen riding in   
 the lanes on Sunday afternoons and    
 after school during the week. Many    
 E.C.L.P. lorries use the roads in the 
 area to transport China Clay. The     
 local farms make considerable use of  
 farm machinery such as tractors and   
 trailers. These sometimes cause a few 
 problems when they have to travel     
 along the narrow lanes.     (Sue Hall)</content>
