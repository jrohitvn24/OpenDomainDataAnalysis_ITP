		<title>09THE ELDERLY</title>
		<content> We interviewed several elderly people 
 in our area to discover how they cope 
 with life in 1985. Most people we     
 interviewed were quite happy with the 
 facilities for the elderly within     
 Sittingbourne. We discovered, however,
 that there are several kinds of old   
 people's homes. Several homes in the  
 area combined independence with care  
 and supervision. Others, however,     
 forced the elderly to live in very    
 close proximity and this caused       
 anxiety and unhappiness in some. A few
 went to the local club which arranges 
 outings and talks for the elderly but 
 this we felt lacked variety and few   
 bothered to attend. Their main        
 complaints were the traffic and the   
 bus fares which they thought should be
 cheaper. A few wanted the Age Concern 
 to do more and some regretted that    
 there are no nearby hospitals.        </content>
