		<content> This is a spacious and lofty building 
 for a village,due to the rebuilding in
 the Perpendicular style of the nave   
 and aisles in the late 15th century   
 when the chancel arch was also        
 rebuilt.The Tower topped by a dumpy   
 broach spire,was erected in the first 
 quarter of the 14th century.The       
 chancel,of a similar age,was greatly  
 changed by restoration in 1890.The    
 wall painting behind the pulpit was   
 uncovered in 1937 and may be of       
 St.Edmund,King of the East Saxons,    
 martyred and buried at Bury St.Edmunds
 in 870 AD,or more likely,King Edward  
 the Confessor who died in 1042.There  
 are 2 brasses in the chancel,one dated
 1486 of Helyn Hardy and one 1520 of   
 Edward Watson whose family acquired   
 Rockingham Castle from Elizabeth I.   
 There are still Watsons living there.
