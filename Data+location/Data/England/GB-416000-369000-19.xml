		<title>19CUSTOMS. WELL DRESSINGS</title>
		<content> The actual dressing has to be done in 
 a week, but we start before this.The  
 clay for the backing is dug and put in
 the river in sacks, to soften a week  
 before we start.  On Friday night it  
 is thrown on to the board to make it  
 stick, smoothed and left to stand     
 over night.  Next day work starts.    
 A pattern is laid on the clay, and    
 prickd through to mark the picture    
 into the clay.  The picture is then   
 marked in with wool.  This can take   
 one or two days.  Then the 'filling   
 in' starts. First non-perishable      
 items are put in, gravel, lichen,     
 etc.  Then the seeds, mosses, twigs   
 and longer lasting plants are added.  
 The petals are added last, Wed. Thurs.
 and Fri. because they will not last   
 long. The wells are erected on        
 Saturday morning.Six wells are        
 dressed.                              </content>
