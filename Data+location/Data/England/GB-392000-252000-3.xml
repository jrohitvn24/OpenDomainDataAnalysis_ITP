 Many of the hedgerows are trimmed low 
 by mechanical hedge-cutters and       
 therefore are not so picturesque.     
 There are small areas of deciduous    
 trees on  farms and in hedges. Some   
 re-planting of trees is taking place. 
 Footpaths and bridlepaths are fairly  
 well-maintained and efforts are being 
 made to sign-post them.   Footpaths   
 are a subject of some discussion owing
 to the conflicting needs of walkers   
 and farmers.  Worcestershire has an   
 exceptional mileage of foot- and      
 bridlepaths.  There is an abundance of
 wild-life:  foxes, hares, rabbits and 
 squirrels.  Many species of birds are 
 found, with large numbers of rooks,   
 wood-pigeons, starlings and lapwings.
