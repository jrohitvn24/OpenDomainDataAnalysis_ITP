		<content> The Bell Inn was originally called the
 Blue Bell Inn from the surrounding    
 bluebell fields.The licensee Mr Colman
 sells more than seven kinds of beer,  
 thirty kinds of spirits and pub food  
 and snacks.The most popular drink is a
 well-known Danish lager.The Inn also  
 sells cigarettes and there is a       
 Space-Invaders game.                  
 The building dates from 1620 but has  
 twice been extended in 1928 and 1979. 
 There is a{Beer Garden}where children 
 can go with their parents.During the  
 winter the Inn has a group of about   
 twenty 'regulars', but this number is 
 swelled to about two hundred with the 
 summer visitors from the nearby{      
{Norfolk Broads.}Some of the ladies    
 make up a{darts team.}The Inn is      
 advertised on beer mats and towels    
 supplied by the brewery.  (contd)
