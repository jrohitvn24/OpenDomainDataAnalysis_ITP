		<title>10 PROPOSED CHICKEN FARM</title>
		<content>    Faccenda hope to build a chicken   
factory housing nearly one quarter of a
million chickens in woodland of the    
Bicester-Whitney road.                 
    This is opposed vigorously by the  
Middleton Stoney inhabitants because of
the smell which will come from the     
factory.It would also bring extra      
traffic to the area(which is bad enough
already)and spoil the view.            
    The owners insist that all         
precautions will be taken to relieve   
the smell.A public enquiry was held on 
JULY 9th 1985 to consider the proposed 
siting.                                
    The proposed factory will bring    
some forty jobs to the area,but these  
will probably come from Bicester       
and not Middleton Stoney.              
    The people from Middleton Stoney   
will get the smell and not the JOBS!
