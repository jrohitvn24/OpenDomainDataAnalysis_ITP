 There are 5 woods in our block-Nobles 
 wood Sands plantation, Holton         
 park, Water lane plantation and Lodge 
 plantation.Holton park is the largest 
 wood and nobles wood the              
 smallest.There is a mixture of        
 deciduous and evergreen.There are a   
 lot of oak trees and fir trees.Mr.Dunn
 looks after the Holton park and makes 
 sure that new trees are planted.      
   Mrs.Foster who lives in Holton      
 village has prepared a very full and  
 interesting list of the flora in      
 Holton-le-Moor.Unfortunately this was 
 to long to include but is available to
 anyone interested from the school.
