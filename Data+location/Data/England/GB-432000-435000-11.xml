		<title>11MULTI-RELIGIOUS COMMUNITY</title>
		<content> Although the vast majority of the area
 has a religious base that is similar  
 to most parts of the country, there is
 one section that can be truely termed 
 multi-religious in nature.  Mosques,  
 chapels, churches and temples all     
 serve the local community. The newest 
 Mosque, the Shahjalal Mosque serving  
 the Bangladeshi community was opened  
 with due ceremony on the 5th May 1985.
 Originally the mosque was two private 
 houses, and with lots of hard work    
 these were knocked into one large     
 building. Despite a few problems the  
 mosque was finally ready for the      
 official opening ceremony.  Local     
 dignitaries were invited, plus the    
 High                                  
 Commissioner for Bangladesh, as well  
 as religious leaders of the local     
 community.
