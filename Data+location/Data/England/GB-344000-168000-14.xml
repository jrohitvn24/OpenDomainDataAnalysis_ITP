		<title>14Recreation in Nailsea</title>
		<content> There are two small sports centres in 
 Nailsea;-{Grove Sports Centre}and     
{Mizzymead Sports Centre.}They are both
 run by committees of local people. The
 Grove centre has facilities for       
 badminton and table-tennis indoors and
 cricket outdoors. Mizzymead has a     
 bowling green and tennis courts.      
 There are public playing fields at the
 Scotch Horn Centre, a hall suitable   
 for dramatic productions, weddings,   
 public meetings etc., which has been  
 built recently near the old glassworks
 site south of the High Street. A small
 play area with swings, climbing frame 
 and slide provides some recreation for
 young children off Hannah More Road.  
 The nearest swimming pool is in       
 Backwell. There are football, hockey, 
 cricket, chess, skittles, cycling,    
 walking, croquet, orienteering clubs--
 but no rugby club; a sad omission!    </content>
