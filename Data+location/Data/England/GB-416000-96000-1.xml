		<title>01Bransgore Village</title>
		<content> Bransgore is situated North-East of   
 Christchurch and has grown a lot in   
 recent years.In the area that we      
 surveyed there are shops, a garage,   
 public houses, schools, many farms and
 housing which includes very old       
 cottages and some very modern designs.
   A visitor to the area would notice  
 the green countryside on either side  
 of the narrow lanes. Picturesque farms
 with quaint farmers cottages very     
 close to the lanes. The land is low   
 lying and tends to hold water a       
 particular problem in heavy rain.     
   The type of person who lives in this
 area would be a farm worker or someone
 who likes to be close to the          
 countryside and who may work in the   
 many towns nearby.
