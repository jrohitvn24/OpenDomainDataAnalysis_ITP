		<title>12MAY FESTIVAL - ETON WICK</title>
		<content> Every year{Eton Wick School}holds a   
{May Fayre.}At the beginning we sing a 
 song. In 1985 we started with "Good   
 morning Lords and Ladies".            
 The Town Crier told us what was going 
 to happen. Each class presented a     
 song,dance or poem in front of the May
 Queen.                                
{The May Queen}has a special dress and 
 a crown of flowers. She has a maid of 
 honour and a little girl and boy      
 attendant. The boy has to give the    
 crown to the maid to put on the       
 Queen's head.                         
 In 1985 each class had a person to    
 take a card to the town crier and he  
 shouted out what was going to happen  
 next. Each class did some country     
 dancing. The top year do the{Maypole  
{Dancing}which is a special part of the
 Festival.At the end the{May Queen     
 declares it over and the stalls open. </content>
