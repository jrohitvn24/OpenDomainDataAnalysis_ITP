		<title>09History of Moreton</title>
		<content>{A change but not for better.}In       
 the last half century,Moreton has     
 changed considerably.In a few decades 
 a tiny village has become a sprawling 
 residential outlet.The main rd. 60    
 years ago was just a narrow lane      
 surrounded by fields and farms and a  
 few huts.Moreton was very remote and  
 isolated from Wallasey and Birkenhead.
 In 1928 Wallasey's boundaries took    
 Moreton under its municipal wing      
 building council estates and new roads
 .Those who have known Moreton from the
 old days miss the wide open spaces and
 the small friendly village atmosphere 
 and one cannot doubt that the old peop
 le remember the better times of       
 Moreton.The village of Greasby has als
 changed.Once just afew cottages and   
 farms,rapid growth in the 1970s, has  
 given the village an urban character.
