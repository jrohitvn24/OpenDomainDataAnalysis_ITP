		<content>       {THE SPORTS HANGAR}             
                                       
   One of the disused aircraft hangars 
 on the Tern Hill airfield has been    
 converted into a Sports Centre.       
   It has facilities for a variety of  
 sports. There are two five-a-side     
 football pitches and four badminton   
 courts. Also there is a trampoline for
 gymnastics practice, an area for      
 indoor hockey, and ranges for both    
 rifle and archery target practice.    
   Quite a lot of the equipment needed 
 can be hired in the centre. Expert    
 staff is available to give            
 instruction.                          
   One of the latest additions that the
 children enjoy is the roller skating. 
 For this you need to wear a pair of   
 special boots. Small wheels are       
 attached to the soles of the boots.   
 These allow you to travel at speed.   </content>
