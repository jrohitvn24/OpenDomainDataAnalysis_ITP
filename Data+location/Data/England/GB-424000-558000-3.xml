		<title>03ANIMAL REFUGE- GATESHEAD</title>
		<content>    Robert Bryson was an animal lover  
 who was very distressed when he saw   
 unwanted pets being thrown into a     
 nearby quarry. He went to the quarry, 
 collected the pets and took them      
 home.He found that he had too many, so
 he bought an old school in 1943 and   
 turned it into an Animal Refuge, run  
 by voluntary helpers.                 
    Mr Bryson died in 1983 but his good
 work still continues.There are now    
 eight paid staff and voluntary        
 workers. Grazing land is loaned free  
 of charge by Gateshead Metropolitan   
 Borough Council.Food for the animals  
 is donated by the public.             
    On the day of our visit,there were 
 one hundred horses,sixty cats, two    
 cows,twenty five dogs,fourteen goats, 
 two sheep, pigeons, doves, budgies,   
 ducks, geese, chickens, rabbits,      
 cockerels and a pig.                  </content>
