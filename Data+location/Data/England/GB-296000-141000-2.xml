		<title>02RIVER AVILL</title>
		<content>  It was written in 1183 that Dunster  
 had a port and it seems that small    
 boats could come up the river as far  
 as the castle. Probably as the boats  
 got bigger and the river gradually    
 silted up, the harbour was moved      
 further down towards the sea. In 1565,
 "Dunster Haven" was listed as a place 
 at which small boats could land salt, 
 wine, food, wood and coal but when    
 port facilities were developed at     
 Minehead, the harbour at Dunster was  
 used less and less and today there is 
 no harbour at all.                    
 The River Avill also gave the power to
 work two flour mills. The lower mill  
 has disappeared. The upper mill was   
 rebuilt in the early 19th century and 
 has recently been restored and is     
 making Dunster flour and people can   
 visit the mill to see the mill at     
 work.                                 </content>
