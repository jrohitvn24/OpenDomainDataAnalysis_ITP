		<title>10ROAD ACCIDENTS IN BURWELL.</title>
		<content>  In the parish of Burwell 7 out of 10 
 accidents happened when people turned 
 right,left or missed junctions.Another
 2 were caused by bad road conditions  
 such as ice,snow,rain and fog.        
  A common{cause of serious accidents  
 is when drivers go too fast and       
 without wearing seat-belts.An example 
 took place on a Tuesday along Heath   
 Road.A car was travelling at 60m.p.h. 
 when the driver lost control on the   
 brow of a hill.He hit another vehicle 
 coming the other way.                 
  Most accidents involved cars rather  
 than lorries,motor-bikes or bicycles. 
  At school every year there is a      
{Cycling Proficiency Test}to see if    
 children are safe on their bikes.     
 This year a big{County Safe Cycling   
{Competion}was held in Burwell.2       
 Village College pupils won prizes of a
 radio and a watch.                    </content>
