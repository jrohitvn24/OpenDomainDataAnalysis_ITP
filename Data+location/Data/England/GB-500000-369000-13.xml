       Old Heighington School was      
 opened on the eighth of January,1877, 
 when only three people                
 attended,the number gradually         
 increased to forty eight.             
    Then later the school closed and a 
 grammer school was then opened,there  
 was also a boys and a girls school    
 opened in the area.                   
    The School was closed in 1969 and  
 then the closure of the boys School   
 followed.After that the new           
 Heighington School was built,and still
 remains on Mill Road.
