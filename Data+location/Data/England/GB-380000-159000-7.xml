		<content>  Bradford-on-Avon was populated by    
 Ancient Britons from earliest times.  
 The Romans settled here from A.D.80   
 until A.D.450. A Roman villa was      
 uncovered when our new comprehensive  
 school was being built. The Saxons    
 built a church in our town in about   
 700A.D. Our town's name is pure Anglo 
 Saxon, "Broad Ford." The Vikings      
 attacked the Abbess of Shaftesbury's  
 monastry here. Alfred the Great       
 battled with the Vikings and King     
 Canute attacked the town.{

  We have a famous and magnificent 13th
 century tithe barn, a unique 14th     
 century bridge upon which sits a,

 prison. Tourists flock to the town in 
 thousands, particularly in the Summer
