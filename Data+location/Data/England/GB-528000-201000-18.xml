		<content> The{Kidston Institute}in Northaw was  
 built in 1902 with money provided by  
 Mrs. John Kidston whose husband had   
 died in 1894. She intended it as a    
 'social meeting place for men'.It is  
 endowed for Â£1000 which must revert to
 the Church if it fails. Today it has  
 snooker tables in constant use and    
 there is a very successful Table      
 Tennis section with players of        
 national standard.

 National School at a cost of Â£600.    
 Since that date alterations and       
 additions have been made and today it 
 is a Primary School with two teachers.

 in Church Lane for{sheltered
