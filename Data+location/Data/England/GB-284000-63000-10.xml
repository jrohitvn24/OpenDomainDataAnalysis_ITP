		<title>10Marldons Apple Pie Festival</title>
		<content> Every year on August Bank Holiday     
 there is a special day in Marldon.    
 A procession starts at the top of the 
 hill and goes all the way to the      
 Jubilee meadow, following a donkey and
 cart. The cart has a big apple pie    
 in it. On one of the floats is a      
 princess, who is chosen from the top  
 class girls in the school. There are  
 other floats, majorettes, and people  
 dressed up.                           
 At the Meadow there are horse and     
 donkey rides and even a rabbit show. A
 celebrity cuts the Apple Pie, and it  
 is sold. The fair raises money for the
 village hall. It has been going on for
 about 100 years.                      
 It stopped for a while and then was   
 revived about 20 years ago. It is     
 hoped that enough money will be made  
 to pay for a new hall, as the present 
 wooden hut is not big enough.         </content>
