		<content> The{Rev. P. Barber}runs two parishes  
 with  one church in each,{St Philip's 
 at Mosser and{St Bridgets}in Brigham. 
 In winter on Sunday he normally takes 
 3 services. In summer he takes 4. 40  
 people normally attend the services.  
 Apart from services he officiates at  
 baptisms, weddings, school services   
 and funerals. On Wednesday morning for
 40 minutes at{Paddle School}he teaches
 us R.E. In his spare time Mr Barber   
 often goes visiting ill people in     
 hospital and old people. St Philip's  
 church, about 100 years old is just up
 the road from school. As most churches
 do it faces east and is a rectangular 
 shape. The church has a small font.{St
{Philip's}when full up holds a little  
 over 100 people. Our school's harvest 
 festival is held at the church.{St    
{Bridget's}is a{Norman}church with some
 very old stained glass windows.       </content>
