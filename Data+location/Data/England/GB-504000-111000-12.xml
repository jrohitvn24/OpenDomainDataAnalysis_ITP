		<content> A few of the families in this area    
 receive social security payments, and 
 some of the eldery people have meals  
 on wheels at 95p per meal.            
 Families with children receive child  
 benefit payments. A doctor has a      
 surgery 3 times a week in Amberley    
 Village, those living nearer to       
 Storrington or Pulborough attend the  
 doctor in those villages. The nearest 
 dentist is in Storrington. The nearest
 hospitals in Chichester or Worthing   
 and the nearest employment office is  
 in Littlehampton. A district nurse    
 attends those who need care at home.  
 The Amberley Society was founded in   
 1976 to protect the Wildbrooks from   
 drainage by the Southern Water        
 Authority. It receives a great deal of
 support from local people and         
 societies interested in conservation. 
 It watches over conservation matters. </content>
