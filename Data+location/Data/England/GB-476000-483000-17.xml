		<title>17History of Wrelton and Dis.</title>
		<content>     Pickering's western neighbours    
 along the A170 are Middleton, Aislaby,
 Wrelton and Sinnington.It is often    
 pointed out that the initials of these
 five towns can be taken and arranged  
 into the word SWAMP, and indeed this  
 area was once wet and swampy.         
     Wrelton is said to mean"hill where
 felons were executed"and indeed there 
 is a Gallowshead lane not far away.The
 village of Wrelton marks the junction 
 of the westward road from Pickering   
 with the Roman road,which probably    
 forms its northerly town street.A     
 small village green marks the actual  
 crossing.This green is surrounded by  
 Georgian farms and houses.There is a  
 restored "cruck" building of 1665.On  
 the main road is the "Buck Inn",sole  
 survivor of several old alehouses that
 once served the stagecoach route.
