		<title>08HOUSES IN WHITTON</title>
		<content> Firstly Whitton was a little village  
 with small houses and cottages and the
 odd shop. In 1930 many new modern     
 houses were built. Also the shops and 
 the railway station were built at this
 time. In the last 20 years there has  
 been more building- mostly houses, but
 some tower blocks. A survey showed us 
 that most of the houses in the area   
 are semi-detached brick built houses  
 with tiled roofs. Some people live in 
 terraced houses built in around 1900. 
 There are some council houses in the  
 area which were built in the 1920's.  
 There used to be some large houses and
 estates in the area but only Kneller  
 House survives. It is used as a       
 Military School of Music although it  
 may soon be closed.
