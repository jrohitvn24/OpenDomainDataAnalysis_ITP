		<content>  Our school is one of the oldest in   
 Kent.The boys went to Hosey Hill where
 they played in the woods,worked very  
 hard and were extreemly proud of the  
 long history of the school.Mr.Hook,the
 oldest living old boy told us that    
 during the first world war the army   
 used the woods for grenade practice.  
 Later one boy brought a live grenade  
 he had found into school,which then   
 had to be evacuated!                  
  The school had its own song which you
 can see on other pages.               
  The girls and infants were together  
 at St.Marys and it remained that way  
 until Summer 1983 when the boys and   
 girls were taught together for the    
 first time in 150 years.              
  We hope to be able to have all the   
 school on one site  when we move into 
 Churchill Secondary School which is   
 now closed.                           </content>
