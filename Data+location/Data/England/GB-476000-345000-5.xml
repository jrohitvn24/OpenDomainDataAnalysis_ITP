		<title>05Riverlands Farm (mixed farm)</title>
		<content> On Monday 17th June our school went to
 Riverlands farm. Mr Burton showed us  
 around . There are 300 acres of land. 
 Mr Burton's farm is  arable and       
 livestock. He has two and a half      
 workers. He grows 4 main things,      
 barley, wheat, rape and beans. He has 
 170 cattle that he breeds for beef.   
 Altogether he has 550 cattle a year.  
 Mr Burton has a Limousin bull which is
 13 months old and weighs 460kg. The   
 cows eat 70% barley 20% wheat and the 
 rest are minerals. Cattle now put on  
 more weight because there is better   
 food than a few years ago and they get
 fed more. The food is always there    
 because the farmers keep it in a      
 bucket and let the cows get it when   
 they want it. The new breeds of cattle
 are Romagnola and Charolais. They     
 don't keep the old breeds because they
 have too much fat on their meat.      </content>
