		<content> The landscape is undulating with      
 drainage by the{R.Eau.}It flows{N.W}  
 through a small valley cut in the {   
{Frodingham Limestone}(and thence into 
 the{R.Trent}).Its tributaries are Dar 
 Beck,Scotton Beck and 4 small drains  
 which join it in this area.The highest
 ground lies in the{S.W}and along the{N
 side with elevation up to{27m}above   
 sea level.Seismology surveys have been
 made recently but there are no oil    
 drillings as yet and no plans have    
 been announced.The population is      
 concentrated in the two villages of   
{Scotter}(pop.2750) and{Scotton}       
 (pop.469) as well as small family     
 groups in farms scattered throughout  
 the area.                             
    Further information can be found in
 the books{"Scotter - Our Village"}and 
{"Scotton,Aspects of Village Life".}
