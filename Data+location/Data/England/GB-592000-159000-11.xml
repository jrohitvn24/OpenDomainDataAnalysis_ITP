		<title>11FRUIT FARMING IN LYNSTED</title>
		<content> The main fruit farm in Lynsted is     
 called F.T.Holt &amp; Son. About 6 people 
 drive lorries of fruit to the market. 
 As the months pass they have different
 fruits. In the summer cherries        
 come. Soon after that it is plums. At 
 Bouchers Farm he mainly deals with    
 apple picking &amp; a small amount of     
 cherries to go with the apples. I have
 got a plum orchard owned by Holt at   
 the side of my house. The trees were  
 planted two years ago. Also at the    
 back of my house there is a pear      
 orchard. We call it the plantation. At
 the back of Mill Cottage down the road
 are cabbages. Many of the mothers in  
 the area have no jobs in the winter   
 but like to work in the fields in the 
 summer. At the Kent Show in July, Holt
 sends off some apples ad other fruits 
 to be judged there.
