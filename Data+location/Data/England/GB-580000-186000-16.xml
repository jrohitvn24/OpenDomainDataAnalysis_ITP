		<content>  The housing is mostly of a very high 
 standard. Bungalows feature strongly  
 in the S.E. of the block especially   
 near the Fairway. Here there are many 
 tree-lined avenues and boulevards,    
 featuring chestnut, oak and flowering 
 cherry. In the S.W.,the children did a
 survey of 1403 homes and found that   
 47% were semi-detached houses,chalets,
 or bungalows;36% were detached houses,
 bungalows or chalets;8% were apartment
 blocks,and 9% were terraced.          
  The children at Hadleigh Jun.Sch.live
 in mostly centrally heated homes with 
 gardens to play in.Some share bedrooms
 with their siblings and a few have    
 their own T.V.s and computers in their
 rooms.All homes today have bathrooms, 
 some have showers and cloakrooms as   
 well.Under the main colour T.V.,many  
 families have a video recorder and    
 they hire full length films to watch. </content>
