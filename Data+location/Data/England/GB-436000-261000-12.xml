  Ufton Fields Nature Reserve is an    
area of about 77 acres which used to   
be limestone quarries in the early     
1950's.The land was partly reclaimed by
planting large numbers of trees        
particularly Poplars,Conifers &amp;        
Alders. In 1971 {WARWICKSHIRE COUNTY   
COUNCIL} took over management as a     
local nature reserve.Since that time   
the reserve has been managed by the    
Warwickshire Nature Conservation Trust 
(WARNACT) on behalf of the County      
Council.The main features of western   
part are parallel spoil ridges and     
numerous pools.Eastern parts are       
wooded,flat and marshy. Access is      
restricted to the public footpath      
except for permit holders.Digging,reed 
pulling,hedging etc is done in         
winter,while surveys and studies are   
carried out according to a plan.       </content>
