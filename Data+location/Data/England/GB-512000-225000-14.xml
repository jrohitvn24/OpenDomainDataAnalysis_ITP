		<title>14THE CHURCH IN  OFFLEY</title>
		<content>   Edward III gave a grant for a church
 to be built at Offley. Legend suggests
 that King Offa was connected with a   
 church on this site but the evidence  
 cannot be validated; tiles once       
 thought to have Offa written on them  
 were in fact to commemorate one Ossa, 
 written in the old English style. The 
 south porch is early English. The font
 is a beautiful example of Totternhoe  
 stone carved in the late 14th century;
 unlike other fonts in the area this   
 one is undamaged. The chancel was     
 re-designed by the Salusbury family in
 1777 and holds a monument by Nollekens
 to Sir Thomas Salusbury.  The crenell-
 ations have caused the chancel to be  
 in need of structural support. The    
 tower contains a peel of six bells.   
  Unfortunately, the church is not well
 attended and the priest-in-charge     
 lives in another village.             </content>
