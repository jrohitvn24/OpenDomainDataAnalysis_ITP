		<title>10Arable at Pitlock Farm</title>
		<content>   Pitlock Farm was a fruit farm four  
 years ago.  The owners decided that   
 too many farms were becoming fruit    
 farms.                                
   An interesting factor about Pitlock 
 is that it has a pond which Worcester 
{Conservationists}are interested in;   
 there is plenty of wildlife.  Mallard 
 duck were tried out, but the foxes ate
 them.                                 
   The actual farm is 60 acres.  The   
 main land use is arable:  it has equal
 amounts of winter wheat, barley and   
 herbage seed.  They have some forage  
 seed which they sell to merchants for 
 cattle feed and combine seed.         
   They have 3 farms nearby, adding up 
 to 400 acres in all.  The actual      
{farmhouse}dates from the 14-15th      
 century; it has an impressive chimney.
 The roof used to be thatched.
