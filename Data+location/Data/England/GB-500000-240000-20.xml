		<content> laid three miles of wiring, used fifty
 pounds of gelignite and spent a month 
 preparing the chimneys. "I have had   
 sleepless nights in the past month",  
 he said.                              
 Big Bertha contained 149,649 bricks   
 and she was watched by thousands of   
 people including Norris McWhirter and 
 Roy Castle from the Guiness Book of   
 Records. The lady who pressed the     
 button became a "record breaker" since
 the chimney was the fastest demolition
 ever. There were also cameras from    
 five television centres including     
 three from the BBC and one from       
 Germany. The event raised about Â£1,000
 for charity.                          
 New techniques in brick making may    
 ensure that more chimneys are         
 demolished in the future.
