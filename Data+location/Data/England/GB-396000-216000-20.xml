		<title>20DOMESDAY SURYEY; METHODOLOGY</title>
		<content>  In days of old man made a list,      
  Of birds and beasts and man,         
  No sheep, nor crop nor land was      
                              missed,  
  The Domesday book began.             
                                       
  Once more the Royal Commission has   
                                asked, 
  Another list to be made,             
  And so we are to bridge the past,    
  Our Domesday book to aid.            
                                       
                                       
     This work was done by the top     
 junior class and the two first year   
 senior classes of Whitefriars school. 
 It gives our impressions of the day   
 (4.7.1985) that we spent in our area. 
 Our teachers set up visits and        
 interviews and asked us to carefully  
 observe; especially the flowers. The  
 work probably says a lot about us!!!!!</content>
