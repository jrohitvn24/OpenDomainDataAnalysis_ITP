 1973.   It is quite new and has a head
 teacher and 10 teachers. With about   
 315 children. The average number in   
 each class is 32.   The school day

 The school is mixed, and has five     
 infant classes and five junior classes
 including one mobile classroom.  There
 is also  a big hall,  a kitchen, a    
 library, and a courtyard. In this     
 courtyard there are two ponds, and the
 sandpit for the younger childen.  We  
 have two playgrounds and three fields.
    There is a wendy house in the      
 infant playground and a games hut     
 in the junior playground.   In our
