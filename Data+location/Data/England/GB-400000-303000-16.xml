		<content> Pelsall dates back to A.D. 994 where, 
 in Wulfruns Charter it was recorded as
 Peolshale and belonged to the Canons  
 of Wolverhampton.                     
    In the Domesday Book it is         
 described as 'WASTE'.                 
    In 1311 reference is made to a     
 church, a small place of worship in   
 Paradise Lane.In 1327 the population  
 consisted of only 11 men.             
    By the end of the 19th century     
 several hundred men were employed in  
 Pelsall Ironworks                     
    When the iron trade slumped        
 Pelsalls period of heavy industry     
 ended.                                
   Modern day Pelsall is now a thriving
 village with a population of 12,000.It
 has come a long way since the 'Waste' 
 land of the first Domesday Book.
