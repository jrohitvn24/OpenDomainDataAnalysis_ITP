		<content>}  In the area the schools aren't      
 very large.                           
   There are many pre-school           
 playgroups with an age range of 3-5.  
 The village playgroups are normally   
 held in village halls or in a church  
 hall. These are usually run by        
 mothers.                              
   The village schools in Bradford     
 Peverell and Stratton have closed down
 because they were uneconomic. The     
 children who live in these villages   
 have to go to Charminster which caters
 for the 5-9 age group.                
   All children who are 9-13 go to     
 Dorchester middle school, most people 
 from Bradford Peverell and Charminster
 go to St. Osmonds. From 13-18 boys    
 go to Hardyes,and girls go to         
 Castlefield school.
