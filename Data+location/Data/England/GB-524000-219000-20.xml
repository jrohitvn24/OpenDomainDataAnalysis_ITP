		<title>20Knebworths Missing Amenities</title>
		<content> Knebworth is a very nice village but I
 would like to see some more amenities.
                                       
 I would like to have a cinema, but as 
 there wouldn't be many people to use  
 it, especially as many people now have
 their own home videos, I suppose this 
 is unlikely.                          
                                       
 I would also like to see a swimming   
 pool, preferably indoor, but as there 
 is a big pool in Stevenage I doubt if 
 this would be possible either. There  
 is a pool in the Junior School, but   
 this is rather small and can only     
 occasionally be used.  It is also     
 quite cold as it is outdoor.          
                                       
 We may one day get a BMX cycle track  
 as there are areas of waste ground    
 which could easily be used for this.
