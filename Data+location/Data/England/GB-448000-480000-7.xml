		<content> Cacti are sent all over the world from
 the Cacti Nursery in Sutton. This was 
 opened 11 years ago by Mr Mottram who 
 employs one local girl part-time to   
 help him.                             
 The Chicken Farm managed by Mr Tim    
 Kavanagh employs 7 people. Most of    
 these employees live in Thirsk apart  
 from Mrs Kavanagh.  There are usually 
 about 3000 chickens which are hatched 
 out at the factory and kept there for 
 a year,after which time they are taken
 to another factory 8 miles away where 
 they are killed, frozen and sent to   
 supermarkets.                         
 Mr Almack started making hand-made    
 furniture 13 years ago. He now employs
 7 men who live within a 10 mile       
 radius of the village. He works mainly
 in oak and all the articles made have 
 a small carved beaver on them.
