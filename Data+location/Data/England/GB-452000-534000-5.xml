		<title>05The Dig on the School Field</title>
		<content>{The Headland-H/pool By Chautal Lax }  
 In 1983 some archaeologists came to   
 our school.They told us that they     
 thought that the{Medieval Town Wall of
{Hartlepool}was underneath St.Helen's  
 School Field.Later they came and dug  
 up the field and the first things that
 they found were bits of{Victorian     
{pottery and pipes.}Later they did find
 bits of the Medieval Wall.There was   
 another'dig' on the headland-this one 
 was on the site of the old{Henry      
{Smith's School.}Traces were found of  
 the{Old Friary Church}built in 1240 by
 the Franciscans.The monks had made a  
 promise to be very poor and they spent
 their lives looking after the sick.   
 There are now modern houses built on  
 this sight.I found out about this in  
 the cabin at the{Church Close}'dig'.
