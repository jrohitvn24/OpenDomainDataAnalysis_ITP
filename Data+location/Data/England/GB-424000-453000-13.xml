		<title>13THE FOOD WE EAT.</title>
		<content> We have three main meals a day,       
 breakfast, dinner and tea. Breakfast  
 would usually be cereal. Some people  
 have toast or a cooked breakfast.     
 Dinner would be potatoes, meat and    
 vegetables and a pudding. Puddings are
 tinned fruit such as peaches, manderin
 oranges and pears, or can be things   
 with custard. Sometimes we have       
 ice cream or jelly. Tea can be a      
 cooked meal like beans on toast or    
 salad or sandwiches.For special       
 occasions people would go to a        
 restaurant.Most people buy their bread
 and cakes rather than bake their own. 
 They buy their food from a supermarket
 and will buy a weeks food at a        
 time.Food that is not in tins or      
 packets is kept in the fridge or      
 freezer.Most people buy their         
 vegetables instead of growing them.
