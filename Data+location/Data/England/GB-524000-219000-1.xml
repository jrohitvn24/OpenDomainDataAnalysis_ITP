		<title>01An Overall View Of Our Block</title>
		<content> Our block is set in the varied farming
 countryside of Hertfordshire. The     
 large village of Knebworth has been   
 growing steadily during this century  
 due to its proximity to the railway   
 and the A1(M) motorway. The northern  
 border includes the southern tip of   
 the New Town of Stevenage. The        
 smaller villages of Datchworth and    
 Woolmer Green form the southern       
 boundary, while Bragbury End,         
 Astonbury and Hooks Cross form the    
 eastern edge. Just outside the western
 border of our block lies the original 
 village of Old Knebworth which was    
 centred around Knebworth House and    
 the Parish Church. The majority of the
 land between is arable farmland.
