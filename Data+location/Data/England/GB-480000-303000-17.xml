		<title>17Conflicts in Leighfield</title>
		<content> The area was originally crossed by    
 several footpaths and bridleways but  
 in creating large arable fields these 
 have in several places been ploughed  
 up and not reinstated. Most notable of
 these is the bridleway which runs from
 Launde Park Wood to Leigh Lodge Farm  
 and the footpath from Leigh Lodge Farm
 to Frog Hall has also been ploughed   
 up. Much controversy exists regarding 
 the removal of such ancient rights of 
 way as well as the rerouting of others
 by farmers for their own convenience. 
 Potential conflicts of interest       
 between hunting and shooting are      
 avoided by mutual agreement of hunting
 and shooting dates so that clashes do 
 not occur. The type of hunting country
 has been altered by the replacement of
 grass fields and hedges by arable     
 fields with few natural boundaries, to
 the detriment of the sport.           </content>
