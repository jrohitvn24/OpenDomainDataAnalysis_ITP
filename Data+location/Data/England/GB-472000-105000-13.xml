		<title>13A CHILD'S DAY IN EMSWORTH</title>
		<content> I get up at 7.30 and get dressed.When 
 I've eaten my breakfast I go to school
 which starts at 8.55.We work until    
 10.00 when we have Assembly.Everyone  
 gathers in the hall and we sing hymns 
 and say prayers.Notices are given out,
 then we all go into the playground.   
 During break I stay with my friend    
 Jackie.Break lasts for 15 minutes,    
 then we work until lunchtime.Most     
 children have packed lunches,but some 
 have school dinners.It's playtime     
 again until 1.10.In the afternoon we  
 have Drama and Poetry.We have an      
 afternoon break ,then school ends at  
 3.30.                                 
 I have my tea,then go to the Sailing  
 Club in Emsworth where I am a junior. 
 We have a sailing night each week when
 we sail "Toppers"on the millpond or in
 the harbour.Afterwards we de-rig the  
 boats,have a drink,then go home.      </content>
