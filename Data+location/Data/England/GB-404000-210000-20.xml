		<title>20TRANSPORT IN CHEDWORTH</title>
		<content>   There are many different forms of   
 transport in Chedworth.Most families  
 have at least one car.They are used   
 for shopping trips mostly to          
 Cirencester,but also to               
 Cheltenham,Northleach,Swindon and     
 Gloucester.Some children come to      
 school by car.Many parents in their   
 cars go to work in Cirencester,       
 Cheltenham and Swindon.There are      
 school buses to Bourton on the        
 Water,Northleach and                  
 Cirencester.Farmers use Landrovers and
 tractors to travel round their farms. 
   In winter the snow and ice make the 
 roads dangerous.Sometimes the cars    
 can't get in or out of the            
 village.Some young children come to   
 school on sledges pulled by their     
 parents.Bicycles are useful and some  
 teen-agers go to work on mopeds.
