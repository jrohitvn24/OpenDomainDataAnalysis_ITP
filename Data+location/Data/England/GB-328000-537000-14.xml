		<content> Fellside Primary School building still
 stands but since 1944 children have   
 travelled to Caldbeck for their       
 initial schooling. There is a play    
 school for the 3 year olds and at 5   
 they start in the primary school. At  
 11+ they move to the mixed ability    
 Caldew School at Dalston (13km).      
                                       
 Residents attend evening classes in   
 Caldbeck and sometimes in Fellside    
 school. The main centres are in       
 Dalston (13km) or Wigton (16km).      
                                       
 OUTDOOR ACTIVITIES: Fellside Mansion, 
 owned by the Cumbria Education        
 Authority, caters for outdoor         
 activities (fell-walking, orienteering
 ski-ing etc) for school groups. High  
 Greenrigg House caters privately for  
 small groups following art, music and 
 geology courses.                      </content>
