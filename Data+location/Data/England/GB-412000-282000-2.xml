		<title>02Biography: E.Holden of Olton</title>
		<content> In Kineton Green Road, just off the   
Warwick Road in Olton is Gowan Bank,   
the home of Edith Holden. Edith Holden 
wrote Â£The Diary of An Edwardian Lady'.
In the past few years, this book has   
become very popular and sold many      
hardback copies and was also made into 
a television series.                   
 Edith Holden wrote her diaries from   
1906 to 1911, the 1906 diary being made
into the book. Edith, the daughter of a
Birmingham businessman, spent much of  
her spare time doing embroidery or     
painting. She was also very interested 
in nature and the diary is largely     
about the plants and creatures that she
saw on her many walks into the         
countryside. Her illustrations bring   
the text alive and are a major reason  
for the success of the diary.          
 Gowan Bank is now part of the Olton   
Conservation Area.                     </content>
