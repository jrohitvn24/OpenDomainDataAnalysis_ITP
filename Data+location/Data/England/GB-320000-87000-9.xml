		<title>09THE ROLLE FAMILY</title>
		<content> This family had many estates in this  
 part of Devon and again in North      
 Devon and in fact still do.           
    Evidence of their involvement can  
 be seen in their provision of a school
 given in the early 19th century and   
 Almshouses and a church.              
    Many of the farms around Beer were,
 or still are, part of the land        
 belonging to the estate.              
    The involvement has been continued 
 as the new school in Beer was built on
 estate farmland and the present Lord  
 and Lady Clinton laid the Foundation  
 Stone at the school.
