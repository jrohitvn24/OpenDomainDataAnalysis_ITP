		<title>08GRAVEL PIT RESTORATION, WARE</title>
		<content> Pits have a limited life before being 
 restored to beneficial use. One way of
{infilling}makes use of household and  
 builder's waste. About 600 lorries a  
 day take{rubbish}to one landfill site 
 where it is compacted by vehicles with
 spiked wheels.Eventually it is covered
 with layers of{clay}and{subsoil}before
 the original topsoil is replaced.     
 As the rubbish decomposes it gives off
{methane gas}which is released through 
 pipes. Unfortunately, not all of the  
 gas escapes harmlessly. Some grassland
 nearby is covered in{yellowish patches
 where the gas has seeped through.It is
 said to be harmless to grazing sheep  
 but on the farm they are not so sure! 
 The shepherd reckons that the restored
 fields will never be good enough for  
 growing crops.Some of the land is very
 uneven where the{plastic waste}has not
 decayed and some is virtually useless.</content>
