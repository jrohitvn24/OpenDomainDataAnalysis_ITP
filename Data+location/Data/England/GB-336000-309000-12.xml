		<title>12The Local Pub.</title>
		<content>  The{Elephant and Castle}opened as a  
 hostelry in 1860 when travellers      
 stayed the night while their horses   
 were fed and rested before they could 
 continue their journey down the rough 
 roads.The stables have been demolished
 but you can still see the trough and  
 an old pump for home-made beer.       
{ Mr.Ernest Nickless}worked there for  
 twenty three years.                   
                                       
 The pub used to have                  
 two bars and a cosy alcove and beer   
 was drawn straight from the barrel.   
  Two and a half years ago the pub     
 changed to become the{"Pink Elephant".
 The smaller rooms were knocked into   
 one big one,meals and wine are now    
 served and younger people come from   
 neighbouring towns to enjoy the       
 music and     barbecues.
