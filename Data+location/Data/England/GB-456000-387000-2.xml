		<title>02LONELY LETWELL</title>
		<content> In{Letwell}there are no shops apart   
 from a small post office. Many houses 
 can not have automatic washers because
 it is impossible for the water to be  
 pumped up hill for most houses in   { 
{Letwell}are partly underground because
 they are so old.Many children go on   
 the school bus for it is quite a way  
 to their school.But those are Letwells
 disadvantages. Letwell also has many  
 advantages like it being peaceful and 
 lonely.Many children play on the road 
 for hardly any traffic apart from the 
 occasional tractor uses the road.     
 People in Letwell without a car are   
 stranded but everyone in Letwell says 
 that they would not swap Letwell for  
 anywhere else in the world for they   
 have come to love both its advantages 
 and its disadvantages.In Letwell there
 is a{Norman church}and the only       
{octagonal dovecote}in England.        </content>
