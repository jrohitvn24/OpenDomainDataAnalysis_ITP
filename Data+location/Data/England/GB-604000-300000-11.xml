		<title>11WICKLEWOOD WALK PART2</title>
		<content> Opposite is a large thatched house    
 called Rattle Row House. At one time  
 High Street was called Rattle Row,    
 because of the noise of the           
 weavers'looms.                        
  Further down the road I reach the    
 stream which is crossed by a small    
 bridge, the Waterbridge.              
  Turning left at the cross-roads I go 
 uphill again along Church Lane,       
 passing a mushroom farm, the old      
 village hall and two farms on the way 
 to the church.Reaching the corner, I  
 turn left and reach the primary       
 school, and complete my walk.         
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
