		<title>14Pishiobury Park.</title>
		<content>{Pishiobury Park}covers nearly 250     
 acres.Pishiobury House ,which is a    
 mansion,stands in it.It is made of    
 mellowed brick and is set beside a    
 lake and approached by an avenue      
 nearly a mile long.It contains some   
 wall-panelling and other fittings from
 the Elizabethan manor house which was 
 destroyed by fire.The drive now has   
 large houses on either side.          
 All the houses back onto Pishiobury   
 Park.Pishiobury Park also backs on to 
 the main road,East Park,Pishiobury    
 Drive and Beech Drive.The cows grazing
 in the park sometimes lean over the   
 barbed wire fence and eat the         
 vegetables which people grow.A farmer 
 rents the land from the Hertfordshire 
 County Council and lets the cows roam 
 about in it.People walk through the   
 park to the towpath beside the River  
 Stort.                                </content>
