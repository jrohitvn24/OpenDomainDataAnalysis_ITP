		<content> These 12 square kilometers of South   
 Warwickshire have been surveyed by the
 children of Dunnington Primary School 
 directed by Mrs A. Howell, class      
 teacher. The area lies some 20 miles  
 south of Birmingham. The nearest town 
 is Alcester. Evesham is 6 miles to the
 south, and Stratford-on-Avon some 8   
 miles to the east. The area consists  
 of the village of Dunnington, and the 
 hamlets of Cock Bevington, Wood       
 Bevington and Iron Cross. The area    
 itself is one primarily of fruit      
 growing and market gardening. In      
 recent years, the marketing of crops  
 has been supplemented by a system of  
 'Pick Your Own', whereby customers    
  pick their own fruit and vegetables. 
 Many of the houses were part of the   
 Ragley Estate and were tied cottages; 
 some mentioned in the first Domesday  
 Book.                                 </content>
