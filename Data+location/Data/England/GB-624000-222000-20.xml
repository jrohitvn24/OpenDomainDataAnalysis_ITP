		<title>20THE NAZE CLIFFS</title>
		<content> We measured the approximate height of 
 the cliffs,we found that the cliff was
 roughly 57 metres high,at its highest 
 point and then it decreased in height 
 to the north-east and tilted away from
 the sea.Millions of years ago the Naze
 cliffs were under the sea.We can tell 
 this by the evidence given,which is   
 fossilised shells, sharks teeth and   
 the soft crumbling sandstone.Over     
 the last ten years people have been   
 greatly concerned about the erosion of
 the cliffs by the wind,rain and sea.  
 The extent of this erosion can be     
 seen by studying historical           
 postcards of the area.
