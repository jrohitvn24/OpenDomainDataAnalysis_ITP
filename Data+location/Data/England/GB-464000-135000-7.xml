		<content>       Medstead School is the          
 secretariat of the Needs of the Future
 Group, a group of teachers, advisers, 
 lecturers, HMI's, industrialists and  
 others concerned with the problems    
 facing education within the next few  
 years resulting from the impact of    
 micro technology on schools.          
                                       
       We are currently educating      
 children for a future we cannot       
 describe. Our children need to be     
 educated for change, and to be able to
 cope with the many changes facing     
 society they will meet during their   
 lifetimes.                            
                                       
       The group meets several times a 
 year at various educational and       
 industrial venues. Further information
 from the school.
