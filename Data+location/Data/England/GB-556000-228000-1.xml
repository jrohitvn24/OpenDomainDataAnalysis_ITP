		<title>01Chickney, NW Essex upland</title>
		<content>    This is a pleasant rural scene for 
 the most part gently undulating with  
 farmland and woods. It comprises the  
 sparsely populated hamlets of Chickney
 Hamperden End, Cutler's Green,        
 Sibleys, Sucksted Green and Chaureth  
 Green. Part of it lies within the     
 parish of Thaxted, and part in        
 Broxted. There are 14 farms, although 
 some of them have become dwelling     
 houses with gardens and perhaps a     
 paddock, while the adjoining land has 
 been bought by a farmer who now owns  
 an acreage formerly occupied by 2 or 3
 farms. Many hedges have been removed  
 to make large fields and to facilitate
 the sowing and harvesting of crops    
 with modern machinery. The whole area 
 is covered by about 12 miles of minor 
 roads otherwise the land is crossed by
 farm-tracks, private drives or        
 footpaths.                            </content>
