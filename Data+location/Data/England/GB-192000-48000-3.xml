		<title>03A Day In Grampound School</title>
		<content>  I come to school at ten past eight. I
 put my bag on my peg, get the football
 out and then play in the playground.  
 At nine o'clock the bell is rung. We  
 start by doing reading work and mental
 arithmetic while the register is taken
 and numbers for dinners worked out.   
  At 9.15 we have assembly. This is    
 when the whole school joins together  
 for a short service.We work till 10.30
 because that is when we go out to     
 play. Playtime lasts for 15 minutes.  
 After play we usually do language work
 or creative writing.At 12.00 it is    
 lunch time,some people go home but    
 most stay at school.Some people bring 
 sandwiches others have cooked         
 lunch.Lunch time ends at 1.00.We go in
 and get ready for P.E.We usually do   
 rounders or races.For the last part of
 the day we have geography or science  
 or history.We go home at 3.30.        </content>
