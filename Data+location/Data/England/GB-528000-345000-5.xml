		<content> THERE ARE NO SHOPS IN BROTHERTOFT THE 
 AREA IS NOT LARGE ENOUGH TO WARRANT A 
 SHOP.THE NEAREST SHOP IS AT LANGRICK  
 JUST BY THE BRIDGE.THE SHOP HOLDS A   
 SMALL SELECTION OF MOST THINGS.NEXT   
 DOOR TO THE SHOP IS A GARAGE WHICH    
 REPAIRS MOST OF THE LOCAL CARS.A      
 PETROL STATION STANDS BY THE BRIDGE   
 THE TRADE IS ONLY LOCAL.JUST OVER THE 
 BRIDGE IS A CAFE THIS IS USED BY LORRY
 DRIVERS PASSING THROUGH THE AREA,THE  
 BUILDING WAS A LARGE HOUSE WHICH HAS  
 NOW BEEN CONVERTED.THE ONLY PUBLIC    
 HOUSE IN THE AREA IS CALLED THE FERRY 
 BOAT INN,THIS GOT ITS NAME FROM WHEN  
 THERE WAS NO BRIDGE A MAN WAS EMPLOYED
 TO FERRY PEOPLE ACROSS THE RIVER.THE  
 PUB IS USED BY PEOPLE FROM OUT THE    
 AREA. JUST ON FROM THERE IS A VERY    
 SMALL SHOWROOM FOR CARS IT ONLY HAS   
 ENOUGH ROOM FOR FOUR CARS.
