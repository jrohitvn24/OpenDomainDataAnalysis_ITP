		<content>{  THE GEORGE AND DRAGON PUBLIC HOUSE  
                                       
  There is a plaque on the outside wall
 of  the  building  which  reveals  the
 importance of a meeting in 1820 to the
 development of railways.              
                        On  February   
 12th, 1820 a  meeting  was  held  by  
 the  promoters  of  a railway  between
 Stockton and Darlington ( as opposed  
 to a canal )                          
            The meeting  was  held  in 
 the George &amp; Dragon  by  local  gentry
 to arrange for  a  second  bill  in   
 Parliament.                           
           The  new  bill passed easily
 through  parliament and  the  first   
 Railway Act  has  led  to  a  world   
 wide  network.
