		<title>19Come to Beverley</title>
		<content> If you visit Beverley you could do a  
 lot of things.  On a wet day you could
 go to the new swimming baths. Or if   
 you like visiting interesting places  
 you could go and see the Army         
 Transport Museum near the playing     
 field.  On a lovely hot day you could 
 stroll round this market town and look
 at the historic buildings like the    
 North Bar,St. Marys Church or the     
 Minster.  The Minster took two hundred
 years to build from 1220-1420.        
      You can go walking or riding on  
 the Westwood,play games or go in the  
 woods and swing on the branches and   
 climb the trees.  Beverley also has a 
 golf course and another area of common
 land called Swinemoor.  If you have a 
 car you could go over the nearby      
 Humber bridge,it is a very good view.
