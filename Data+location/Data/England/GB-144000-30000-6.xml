		<content>  The main building is over{100 years  
 old.The most expensive piece of       
 equipment is a heart monitor which can
 show four people's heart beat at the  
 same time.The worst operation to do   
 was on a small baby.Ten nurses work in
 the children's ward,and they love it. 
  In the peak summer season,by the end 
 of July,624 people go into casualty.  
 The hospital does not own any         
 ambulances,they are owned by the      
 Cornwall and Isles of Scilly          
 Authority.If there are too many people
 in the hospital,the staff have a      
 meeting to send home the people who do
 not need an operation.In the hospital 
 there is a place called the H.D.U.    
 which stands for High Dependency Unit.
  In the hospital the most dangerous   
 disease was septicaemia.         Alv. 
  The hospital is on the main road,just
 North of the town centre.             </content>
