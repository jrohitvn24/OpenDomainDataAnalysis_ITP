		<content>   Wilford Court farm's most important 
 crop is strawberries. The farm employs
 250 casual labourers to harvest the   
 fruit. It is then stored in a cool    
 room before being sent to the         
 supermarkets and London wholesale     
 fruit markets. The farm also produces 
 apples and pears. Each fruit tree is  
 only about two metres tall and is     
 shaped like an A to ensure that each  
 fruit gets as much sunlight as        
 possible. This also makes harvesting  
 an easy task.                         
   Bax Farm is one part of a very large
 area of land owned by one farmer. His 
 farm produces apples, pears, plums,   
 cherries, peas, hops, wheat and       
 potatoes. He also grows oil seed rape 
 which is used to make vegetable oil.  
 To protect the crops they are sprayed 
 with 7 tonnes of pesticide per acre.  
 This is vital to ensure healthy crops.</content>
