		<title>15A day in the life of Joanna</title>
		<content> A typical day for me would be to get  
 up at 8.00am, dress in my school      
 uniform and then have a breakfast of  
 toast and apple juice.  I get ready   
 for school, and at 8.40 am I walk to  
 my school which is approximately l00  
 metres from my house. School starts at
 9.00am so I spend a quarter of an hour
 in the playground. After registration 
 we have assembly, with hymns, stories 
 and prayers. Then I spend the morning 
 doing Mathematics, English, and the   
 Domesday Project. Lunch is at l2 noon,
 followed by playtime until l.00pm.    
 Afternoon school consists of singing  
 practice and creative activities      
 followed by a story. At 3.00 pm the   
 Infant Children go home and some of   
 the Junior Class stay for after school
 activities. I stay for rounders and   
 short tennis. At 3.45 pm I go home.
