		<title>01Lothingland General Review</title>
		<content>Our area is a particularly beautiful   
part of rural North Suffolk, dominated 
by mostly arable farms. Lothingland    
Middle School is set in the heart of   
this although only a fifth of our 400  
children come from the villages of     
Ashby, Lound, Somerleyton and          
Blundeston. Most of our children are   
bussed from Oulton Broad which is five 
miles away. Because Lothingland School 
is situated at Lound, most of our      
articles use the village as a starting 
point. However we do have              
contributions from Somerleyton Primary 
School who celebrated their 140th      
Anniversary this year. Although we     
live in times of changes, the roads,   
houses, fields, hedgerows and churches 
reflect the past more clearly than the 
present.
