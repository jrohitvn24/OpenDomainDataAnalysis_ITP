 ARTS AND CRAFTS                       
                                       
 WITH A CHURCH AND CHAPEL IN THE AREA  
 AND TWO WOMENS INSTITUTES CLOSE BY    
 THERE IS NO SHORTAGE OF TALENT IN THIS
 FIELD.LOCALS LIST KNITTING AND SEWING 
 AS THEIR TOP CRAFTS.THERE ARE MANY    
 FETES AND BAZAARS HELD LOCALLY AND    
 WITH A BUS JOURNEY TO A CLOTHING STORE
 (OR CAR JOURNEY) VILLAGERS STILL TEND 
 TO USE THEIR SKILLS AND MAKE THEIR OWN
 CLOTHES.THIS OF COURSE IS A MONEY     
 SAVING TASK AS WELL AS A HOBBY AND    
 THERE IS NOT THAT MUCH TO DO IN THE   
 EVENINGS IN THE AREA SO TO OCCUPY     
 ONESELF IN THIS WAY IS FELT TO BE     
 BETTER THAN JUST WATCHING THE         
 TELEVISION.
