		<title>17PADFIELD VILLAGE - A POEM</title>
		<content> Padfield a village with three corners 
 Quietly set out in the hills          
 Filled with friendly people           
 And the old grey mills.               
                                       
 There's the old chapel on Post Street 
 And the small village school          
 There's the Peels Arms pub on Temple  
 Street                                
 Where people have a drink and play    
 pool.                                 
                                       
 And there's the recreation ground     
 Where the children like to play       
 Some swings, a slide and a roundabout 
 Just right for a summer's day.        
                                       
 So if you ever happen to be passing by
 Just have a stop and see              
 The small village of Padfield         
 And you'll have a happy memory.
