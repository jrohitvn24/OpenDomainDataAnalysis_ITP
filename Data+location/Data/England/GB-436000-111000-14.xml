		<title>14A Marchwood Fisherman</title>
		<content> When we got to Magazine Creek, a local
 fisherman was working on his boat. It 
 has a diesel engine. When he is not   
 working on his boat he is out in it   
 catching fish. Yesterday he was       
 catching eels. He caught 20 in the    
 morning. He is 45 years old &amp; has been
 a fisherman for many years. He has two
 boats. Sometimes he catches clams &amp;   
 sometimes fish that swim. If he cannot
 make a living fishing he works on     
 motor cars. He loves doing fishing    
 most of all.                          
{The Booking Clerk}: The booking clerk 
 gets up at 5.30 &amp; sometimes works     
 every day of the week because the     
 railways are short staffed. When he   
 has days off he likes to travel around
 on trains. If people come to Totton   
 station when the office is locked they
 buy tickets on the train.
