		<content>   The road from Chelmsford to Chipping
 Ongar (A414) is now being staightened 
 out to minimise the risk of hazardous 
 bends.Cozens Farm has lost half an    
 acre of land and a hedge that dates   
 from medevil times. The farmer tried  
 in vain to save the hedge, but was    
 unsuccessful. A new hedgerow is to be 
 planted to replace the hedge.         
   Old Wythers Farm has also lost      
 approximately a half acre area of     
 land. The farmer has had a new pond   
 dug on his land in order to encourage 
 a breeding ground for fish and other  
 pond creatures. He has also stocked   
 his ditch with Goldfish and Rudd.
