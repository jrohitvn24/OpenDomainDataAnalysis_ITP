		<title>14Cottesmore Church Parade</title>
		<content> We have Church Parade beacause it is  
 part of our Brownie Promise.The part  
 we mean is to do our duty to God.We   
 meet outside the camp gates at        
 9:45a.m. near where the church is.When
 we have all the Brownies from our pack
 we walk up to church.We have four     
 flags,3rd Cottesmore,2nd Cottesmore,  
 3rd Cottesmore Guides and the Union   
 Jack.When we get to the church we wait
 for a bit, then when the first hymn is
 sung, we walk up the aisle with our   
 flag and 2 escorts  behind us.We have 
 a gospel before we are blessed then   
 while all the other people are being  
 blessed the choir sings a song.Before 
 the choir walks out the Brownies      
 collect their flags and walk          
 down the aisle.When the service is    
 over the choir walks out.
