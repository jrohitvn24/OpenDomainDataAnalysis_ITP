		<content>   We visited{Marsh Lane Police Station
 to find out how the{police}do their   
 work.{Marsh Lane}is part of the       
{Merseyside Police,}it comes under "B" 
 division and is responsible for the   
{Bootle}area. The{police}have a hard   
 job because there is so much crime    
 around. The biggest crime is theft.   
 This is because houses and shops are  
 often getting broken into, cars get   
 stolen and there is a lot of          
 shoplifting especially in the{New     
{Strand.}One of the main jobs a        
 constable does is{"Walking the beat". 
 This means the constable walks around 
 the area keeping a look out for crime.
 If he sees something suspicious he can
 report it on his radio. The{policemen 
 sometimes direct traffic or help us   
 to cross the road.{The policemen are  
{here to help us. (Kevin Roach)
