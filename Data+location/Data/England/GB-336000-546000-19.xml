		<title>19RENOVATING OLD HOUSES</title>
		<content>   Many of the houses in the area are  
 very old; and renovating one's house  
 is a popular occupation.              
   Mr J.M.Jones bought an old house at 
 Nooklane Head seven years ago and has 
 been renovating it ever since. The    
 house is made of New Red Sandstone and
 is approximately 300 years old.       
   He has discovered some interesting  
 things. While digging in the garden he
 unearthed the foundations of the      
 previous house on the site (i.e. in a 
 different position from the present   
 house). He also found a peculiar      
 shaped stone which he believes to be  
 part of the roof of the orginal house.
 While he was installing a stove in his
 house he had to take out an old       
 fireplace. Behind it he found another 
 fireplace....and another: four blocked
 up fireplaces in all.
