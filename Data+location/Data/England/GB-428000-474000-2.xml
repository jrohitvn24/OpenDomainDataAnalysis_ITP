		<title>02  NORTON CONYERS</title>
		<content>{Norton Conyers}is a mediaeval house   
 situated about one kilometre south of 
 Wath.                                 
   It was built of red brick about 1500
 and the Dutch gable ends were added in
 1630.                                 
   It is set in attractive, but not    
 formal gardens and both house and     
 gardens are open to the public. The   
 remainder of the 1500 acre estate is  
 farmed.                               
   The Graham family have owned{Norton 
{Conyers}since 1624 and although Sir   
 James Graham has recently died his    
 mother still resides there.           
   There are two items of particular   
 interest in the house. One is a fine, 
 large table inlaid with marble that   
 dates from 1570. The other is a letter
 from{Charles 2nd}asking for a loan of 
 money.
