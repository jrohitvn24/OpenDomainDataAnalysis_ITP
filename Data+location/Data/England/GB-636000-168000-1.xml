		<content>    This is part of the Isle of Thanet 
 in North East Kent in the South East  
 of Britain. Originally there were     
 small fishing villages like           
 Broadstairs and farming settlements   
 like St.Peters inland. During the     
 present century this area of top      
 quality farmland has been reduced as  
 the settlements have expanded to merge
 with each other and extend northwards 
 to Reading Street and Kingsgate. At   
 the same time Margate spread eastward 
 along the cliff top to form           
 Cliftonville. Millmead and St.Peters  
 estates are mostly post war buildings.
    Large areas of open farmland still 
 remain below North Foreland lighthouse
 and along St.Peters footpath and      
 towards Westwood. An industrial estate
 has developed atWestwood between the  
 A254 and the old railway line.
