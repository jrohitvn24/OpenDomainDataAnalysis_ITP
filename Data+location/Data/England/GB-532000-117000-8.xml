		<title>08Community Centre, Bur. Hill</title>
		<content>  It has been proposed to make the barn
 next to Birchwood Grove School into   
 the{Folders Lane Community Centre.}   
  Some people in the area are against  
 the idea. They say that more cars will
 make roads dangerous and could block  
 them. After discos, drunken teenagers 
 could disturb the peace. The school   
 might suffer as well as local         
 residents. It could be damaged after  
 children and teachers had gone home.  
  Other people say that the area       
 desperately needs a centre for        
 meetings and leisure activities. A    
 Community Centre might also keep young
 people off the streets and help police
 in the fight against vandalism.       
  In a recent vote,{the Folders Lane   
{Residents' Association's application  
{for planning permission was rejected  
{by one vote.}However, they plan to    
 appeal against the decision.          </content>
