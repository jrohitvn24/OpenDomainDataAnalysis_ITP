		<title>08A RUSHENDEN SPECTACULAR</title>
		<content>    It was the Rushenden Spectacular   
 last Saturday July 20th. There was a  
 big Baby Show which had over 60       
 babies. There were all sorts of stalls
 like hoop-la and lucky dip. You could 
 even win a goldfish.                  
    We watched the tug-of-war teams.   
 That is a competition where teams of  
 men pull as hard as they can at each  
 end of a rope. The ones that pull the 
 hardest are the winners. There was a  
 fancy dress competition but I didn't  
 go in for it.                         
    Later on when it was dark we went  
 on a torchlight procession from       
 Rushenden to Queenborough. It was good
 fun although my torch went out before 
 we reached the end.                   
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
