		<content> The area consists of undulating       
 farmland and woods averaging one      
 hundred feet above sea level.  Because
 of the introduction of the wool trade 
 in the area in medieaval times there  
 are an abundance of large houses and  
 churches, very few thatched cottages  
 remain, but there are many flint      
 buildings.  Of particular note are    
 GREEN FARM, THORPE MARKET, which      
 possesses fine Elizabethan chimneys,  
 CHURCH FARMHOUSE, SOUTHREPPS, a fine  
 example of both "knapped" and         
 "galloted" flintwork.  The church     
 itself was originally built in the    
 l3th century, has the second highest  
 tower in North Norfolk, rising to ll4 
 feet, and was repointed in 1983 to    
 preserve the flintwork. JOHN O' GAUNTS
 HALL, GIMINGHAM, was originally built 
 in the l5 century, rebuilt around 1650
 a JACOBEAN thatched and flint cottage.</content>
