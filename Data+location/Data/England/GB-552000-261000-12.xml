		<content> Lode School is going to be closed down
 at the end of July,1985.There are 32  
 children and two full-time teachers in
 the school as well as a part-time     
 teacher,a secretary and dinne ladies. 
 The Head Teacher is called Mrs.McAuley
 and the Infants teacher is called Mrs.
 Flude.                                
 The school has a very big playing area
 outside with a climbing frame and a   
 learner swimming pool.The building is 
 mainly one big room and has a thatched
 roof.                                 
 Most people in Lode are not happy     
 about the school closing and have     
 protested.The children have been told 
 to go to Bottisham after the summer   
 holiday but some are going to Swaffham
 Bulbeck.
