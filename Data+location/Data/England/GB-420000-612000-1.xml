 The majority of our area is owned by  
 the{Northumberland Estates.}Land which
 is not owned by the Duke includes a   
 small area of private houses on the   
 outskirts of Alnwick and the roads and
 railway which were bought by          
 compulsory purchase order.Most of the 
 area is arable farmland.The farms are 
 called{Golden Moor,Quarry House,      
{Waterside House,Snableazes,Hawkhill,  
{and Alndyke.}                         
 There have been few changes in        
 the area since the 17th century.There 
 is a small Estate village called      
{Denwick}where there have been cottages
 since before 1620 when the earliest   
 existing map of the area was made.It  
 has a small 19th century church.A     
 building of historical interest is the
{Folly on Ratcheugh Crag,}built by the 
 first Duke.                           </content>
