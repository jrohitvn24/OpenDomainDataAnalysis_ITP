		<title>11Beauty Spots In Wendover</title>
		<content> Wendover nestles in a valley at the   
foot of the Chiltern hills of Coombe,  
Bacombe, Haddington and Boddington,    
all of which provide spectacular walks 
amidst magnificent beech woods. To     
the south-west of the village is Coombe
Hill - 852ft - the highest point in the
Chiltern range from whose summit on a  
clear day, one can look over five      
counties.  Below this wooded hill lies 
Chequers Court, country residence of   
the Prime Minister, whose park lands   
extend to the ancient earthwork castle 
of Cymbelines Mount.  Walkers          
frequently visit the village on their  
journey along the Ridgeway Path and the
nearby Icknield Way. North of Wendover 
is the village of Halton, where the    
Rothschild family made their splendid  
home which later became the offices'   
Mess. The gardens were later used as   
Barracks in the First World War.       </content>
