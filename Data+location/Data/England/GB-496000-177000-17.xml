		<title>17WALKING IN ETON</title>
		<content>  Between the built-up areas of Eton,  
 Datchet and Slough and the areas      
 set aside for recreation ,there is    
 still some land available for         
 farming.The neighbouring farmland of  
 Eton Wick overlaps our area.We went   
 for a walk across it. First we passed 
 through a hay-field,then a barley     
 field and then across the road to a   
 larger field of a different strain of 
 barley.The public footpath we followed
 petered out where the new Windsor to  
 Slough by-pass intercepted it.Standing
 in the field we could see the by-pass,
 the M.4.motorway,the Victorian railway
 via-duct and the minor road to Eton   
 Wick.We compared the arches of the new
 by-pass with the old viaduct.Farming  
 in the middle of so much transport    
 must be strange,we thought.There is   
 another area of farmland to the north 
 of Datchet,adjoining the motorway.    </content>
