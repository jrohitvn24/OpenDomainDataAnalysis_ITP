 Somewhere between 1750 and 1760, the  
 house which is now the museum was     
 built.  The building was a hostel for 
 children before it was turned into a  
 museum.  Michael House School used to 
 own the building but at the moment the
 Erewash Borough Council take care of  
 it.  The museum partly opened in      
 September 1981 and officially started 
 on April 23rd.  In the museum there is
 on the ground floor a display of the  
 museum's collection of Civic regalia  
 relating to Ilkeston and Long Eaton.  
 On the first floor there is a bedroom 
 which has been changed into a         
 Victorian sitting room where there are
 some models dressed up in Victorian   
 clothes, and a Lady playing a piano.  
 One model looks out of a window and   
 there is also another model with an   
 1860's dress on.                      </content>
