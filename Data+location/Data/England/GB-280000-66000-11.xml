		<title>11Tree planting at Ipplepen.</title>
		<content>  In July{we planted five trees}in our 
{school grounds}to{commemorate}this    
{modern Domesday Book.                 
  The trees were grown from seeds which
 we collected last Autumn when we      
 visited the Roselands building site in
 our village.                          
  The trees are{Oak, Horsechestnut}and 
{Ash.}They are all planted to the East 
 of our school. Each of the trees is   
 about half a metre in height.         
  We have also planted an oak and a    
 sycamore at the bottom eastern corner 
 of our playing field.                 
  Each of the twenty-eight children in 
 class has taken{a seed}from a{maritime
{pine}to plant in their garden. The    
 seed cone came from the gardens at    
 Dartington Hall.                      
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
