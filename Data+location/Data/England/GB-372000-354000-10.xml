		<title>10Employment in Haslington.</title>
		<content> There are twelve farms in the         
 area,nearly all dairy farms.Despite   
 this large number,few people are      
 employed on the land.Few employment   
 opportunities exist within the area   
 and the largest employer is the Milk  
 Marketing Board processing factory    
 adjacent to the School which employs  
 some 120 people most of whom travel   
 from Crewe.The majority of people in  
 the area travel to Crewe for          
 employment.The majority of full-time  
 workers are employedin the heavy      
 engineering industry-the railway works
 being the largest employer.           
 Apart from small shopkeepers and very 
 small industry,there are few areas of 
 employment within the surveyed area.
