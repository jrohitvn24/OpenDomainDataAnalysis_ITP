		<title>12       THE MAIN ROAD</title>
		<content>    I live in Long Sutton and the A17  
 goes right through our town. The A17  
 starts at King's Lynn and ends at     
 Newark-on-Trent, where the A1 starts, 
 leading to the industrial areas of    
 Yorkshire and the North East. Newark  
 is also a stepping off point for the  
 Midland's industry. In King's Lynn,   
 roads branch off leading to Norfolk   
 and Suffolk coasts. The A47 branches  
 off from King's Lynn leading to ports 
 like Felixstowe and Harwich. The      
 summer holiday traffic at weekends is 
 terrible. People are queueing up for  
 ages. The road is narrow and          
 twisty. Because the road was not built
 for large lorries and endless amounts 
 of traffic there are constant         
 roadworks and detours.
