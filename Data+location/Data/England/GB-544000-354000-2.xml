		<title>02FRISKNEY LANDSCAPE</title>
		<content> Friskney is in a flat and open area   
 separated by many drains and dykes to 
 prevent flooding. The northern part is
 in the Fens, then the Tofts and then  
 land reclaimed from the sea. The whole
 area is fertile arable and double     
 cropping land. The main crops are     
 potatoes, sugar beet, corn and green  
 vegetables. Few hedges line the roads 
 but conservationists are interested in
 planting trees in field corners and   
 recreational areas. A few cattle graze
 in the occasional grass field. Three  
 such fields have old moats. The old   
 brickyard has been landscaped and     
 ponds dredged for private fishing.    
 These schemes will add to existing    
 woods e.g. Decoy Wood  and provide    
 habitats for wild animals and birds.  
 There is a lack of wild flowers,      
 insects and wildlife near the dykes   
 compared to years gone by.            </content>
