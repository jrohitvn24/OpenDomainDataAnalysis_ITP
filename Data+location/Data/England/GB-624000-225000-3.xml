		<content> There is scope for some recreation in 
 the area, especially among the owners 
 of any small craft - yauchts, dinghies
 and canoes. These use the safe        
 anchorage of the Walton Channel during
 the summer months. Stone Marsh itself 
 has a sandy beach which is used for   
 camping, barbecues and picnics. Stone 
 Marsh Island has two other rather     
 interesting connections. Firstly there
 is a historical one. Spearhead-shaped 
 flints have been discovered, pointing 
 to the possibility of a Stone Age     
 settlement there. Hence the name. The 
 other connection is a leterary one. In
 the "Secret Water" by Arthur Ransome  
 Stone Marsh was called Flint Island,  
 reminding us again of the historical  
 aspect. This area is a fascinating one
 for all nature lovers as well as      
 lovers of the sea.
