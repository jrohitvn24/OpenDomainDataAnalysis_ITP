		<content> Barrington School-Spring Term 1985.   
 On February 13th.we had a mini Barn   
 Dance.We played games &amp; danced some   
 country dances.We had some fizzy pop &amp;
 crisps.On Shrove Tuesday we carried   
 out our annual Egg Shackling ceremony.
 Each child puts an egg in a padded    
 sieve which is shaken gently.As each  
 egg cracks it is taken out. The last 3
 eggs in the sieve win prizes.We had a 
 Mothering Day service in the church.We
 sang some hymns:some of us read out   
 the prayers we had made up &amp; 2        
 children read from the Bible.         
 In March our boys took part in a      
 football competition at Neroche school
 at Broadway but they didn't win.
