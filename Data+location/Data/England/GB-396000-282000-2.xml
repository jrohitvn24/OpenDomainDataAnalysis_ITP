		<title>02Housing in Halesowen</title>
		<content>    Since the 1960's housing estates   
 have sprung up throughout Halesowen.  
    The Squirrels Estate built around  
 the mid-70's was anticipated as early 
 as the 1960's due to increasing       
 population figures.                   
    Prior to this in the late sixties, 
 two new housing estates appeared,     
 Halesmere and Huntlands, all of these 
 were greatly opposed as they wrecked  
 valuable farm land.                   
    During the fifties when housing was
 a problem, council houses were erected
 in the Huntingtree area. They barely  
 reached acceptable living standards.  
    One house in Halesown has survived 
 almost 900 years. Located near the    
 town centre, White Friars is believed 
 to be an old manor house. Of timber   
 frame construction, the original walls
 were made of wattle and daub.
