		<content>{GEESE.}On Chester Road,Gatesheath,is a
 farm producing goslings for sale,a day
 old bird costing 3 pounds.To produce  
 the eggs about 100 geese are kept in  
 wire fenced pens by day &amp; in good     
 quality wooden sheds at night.This    
 requires only part-time labour.The    
 young birds are sold through adverts &amp;
 also by reputation,there being little 
 passing trade,although occasionally   
 an egg is sold for craftwork(eg.for   
 decoration in a Faberge style).       
{HORSES.}The 21 acres of land on Oak   
 Farm have been sold for a livery      
 stable for around 15 horses.In a      
 field adjacent to the stables are a   
 considerable number of practise horse 
 jumps.There are also at least 2 horses
 kept in a paddock &amp; stables at a large
 expensive house (built in the 1970's) 
 on the road to Hatton House.Horses are
 for recreation not farm work.         </content>
