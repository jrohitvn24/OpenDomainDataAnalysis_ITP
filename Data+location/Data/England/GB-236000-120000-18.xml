		<content>   There are two hotels in our         
 rectangle. One is Penhaven Hotel and  
 the other is Foxdown Manor.           
                                       
  {Penhaven}is a very nice hotel, it   
 has a good bar, a nice restaurant, a  
 dinning room, bedrooms and in most    
 rooms they have a bathroom. There     
 is a wood near the hotel. The people  
 who own Penhaven are called Maxine and
 Alan Wade. They have a reception desk 
 on the right as you go in the door.   
                                       
{ Foxdown}is a nice big hotel as well. 
 It has a croquet pitch, a big wood    
 about the same as Penhavens; they     
 have a restaurant, a bar, and they    
 have a childrens' play ground too.
