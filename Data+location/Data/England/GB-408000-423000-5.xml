		<content>  There is some work in our part of    
 Southowram,the biggest employer being 
 Marshalls in the south-west of the    
 square.There they make reconstructed  
 stone building bricks by crushing     
 sandstone,then compressing it with    
 cement into slabs and blocks.These    
 products are sent all over Britain,   
 and also exported.The sandstone is    
 brought from nearby quarries.People   
 who live outside the village,commute  
 to work. Some local people work in    
 this part of the village in the shops,
 pubs,clinic and school canteen.Most   
 people work outside the village and   
 travel to work by bus or car.Quite a  
 lot of women used to work at Ingham's 
 making sausages,but now it is used as 
 a food store.There are some new houses
 being built but the builders mainly   
 come from elsewhere to work.
