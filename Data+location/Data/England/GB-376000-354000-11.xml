		<title>11Alsager Peat Moss</title>
		<content> An area of 95 acres of the land       
 surrounding (Moss Farm) is under      
 excavation for sedge peat.  Thirty    
 acres have been extracted to date and 
 it is estimated that five thousand    
 tons of peat are produced in one year 
 at this farm.  The peat is dug to the 
 underlying sand by means of mechanical
 digger and left to dry for two years. 
 Russian peat is added to aid the      
 drying process.  The peat is sold to  
 nurseries, D.I.Y. and garden centres  
 mainly in the north west of England.  
 In recent years it was sent to        
 Manchester United and Everton football
 grounds, and this year forty thousand 
 tons of peat has been transported to  
 the Stoke-on-Trent garden festival    
 site.  Aspects of conservation are    
 taken into account and there is       
 evidence of nesting ducks, pheasants, 
 snipe and foxes.                      </content>
