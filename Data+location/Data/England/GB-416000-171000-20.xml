		<title>20TRAFFIC THROUGH OGBOURNE</title>
		<content> The{A345}is a trunk road; that is, the
 speed limit is 60mph and when it goes 
 through a village it is 30mph.In this 
 area it links Swindon with Marlborough
 and passes very close to Ogbourne St  
 Andrew, though not right through the  
 centre of the village.                
  We conducted a survey of the traffic 
 going along this road, in both        
 directions.The survey was carried out 
 between 1.30 and 2.30pm on a Tuesday. 
  We found that the vast majority of   
 the vehicles travelling on the A345   
 were cars, and many more cars were    
 coming into Marlborough than going out
 at this time of day.We were surprised 
 to find that only 14% of the cars were
 registered in Wiltshire; that is      
 probably because the Berks.,Oxon.and  
 Gloucestershire borders are quite     
 near.We also found that fewer lorries 
 use this road than the A4.            </content>
