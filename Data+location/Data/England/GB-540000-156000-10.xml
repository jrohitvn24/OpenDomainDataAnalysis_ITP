       Life of an average 10 year old  
                                       
At school a child is encouraged to make
his own decisions. He must try to plan 
the day ahead to avoid wasting time    
deciding what topic to do next.As well 
as being independent he is encouraged  
to work in small groups at times, to   
use each others ideas, but not to      
copy.After sharing ideas they may work 
separately then come together again and
discuss their work. If they finish     
their work they may be allowed to use a
computer if available.  There are many 
clubs inside and outside school such   
as football, netball and more. Games   
clubs are very popular.  The libraries 
have a large choice of books, fiction  
and non-fiction. Notice boards are     
often seen in the school with work and 
information on them.                   </content>
