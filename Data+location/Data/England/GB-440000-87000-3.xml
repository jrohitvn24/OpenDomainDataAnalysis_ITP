		<content>    There is a very interesting{oven}at
 the mill.It is possibly the only one  
 of its kind still being used.The oven 
 is a stone building lined with        
 bricks.{Faggots}(bundles of sticks    
 from hazel or beech trees) are put    
 into the oven and burnt to heat the   
 oven.The flames heat the top of the   
 oven and the hot ash heats the floor. 
 A rake some 4 metres long is used to  
 rake out the ash and then the bread is
 put in and the door sealed with dough.
    The{dough mixing machine}is worked 
 by the{water wheel.}The dough is a    
 slow dough and it is left 8 hours to  
 rise The faggots, which were put in   
 the warm empty oven to dry, are lit   
 and it takes nearly two hours to get  
 the oven hot.The dough is made into   
 loaves.When the oven is ready the     
 bread is put in and takes about one   
 hour to bake.                         </content>
