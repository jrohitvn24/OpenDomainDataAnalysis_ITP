		<title>03FARMING, ANIMALS &amp; BUILDINGS</title>
		<content> Although crops cover most of our      
 project area, many animals are also to
 be seen. On our visits we saw cows,   
 bullocks, sheep, hens, pigs and       
 horses. We recognised Friesian cows   
 and Charollais bulls and were told    
 that they were fed on hay, silage,    
 barley and cattle cake. Sheep were    
 seen mainly on the land close to the  
 A19. Hens and pigs are kept by        
 householders as well as farmers and   
 are particularly useful for cleaning  
 up rough ground very quickly. There   
 are two large chicken farms in the    
 area.                                 
 The farmhouses are a mixture of       
 styles.Some are very old and have     
 changed very little. Others have been 
 modernised and, in some cases, farmers
 have built brand new houses for       
 themselves and their families.
