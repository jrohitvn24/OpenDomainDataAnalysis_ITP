		<title>10Technology in Weaverthorpe</title>
		<content>   The earliest kinds of{mechanised    
{farm implements}were the first obvious
 signs of the{technological revolution.
{Sewing machines}improved the women's  
 lives. The{motor engine, telephone,}  
 and{battery wireless}followed. Once   
{mains electricity, water, and drainage
 came to the area, Weaverthorpe  caught
 up with the towns.                    
   The village has{no gas supply}but   
 nearly every house has a telephone and
 all the modern equipment expected in  
 towns.{Video recorders and computers} 
 are becoming popular. There are still 
 several C.B. enthusiasts.             
   The{factory runs on electricity.    
  {Farms are highly mechanised}and use 
 large amounts of chemical{fertilisers,
 applied by tractor or aerially as the 
 insecticide and fungicide sprays.     
   Children, especially the boys, are  
 fascinated by mechanical toys.        </content>
