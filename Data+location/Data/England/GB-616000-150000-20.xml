		<title>20PROBLEMS/ ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title>
		<content> Traffic Problems: All approach roads  
 and the main street are narrow, due to
 the village having developed before   
 the advent of the car. Many cottages  
 have no garages, so residents park on 
 the road. An influx of visitors makes 
 The Street impassable. Disused allot- 
 ments could become a car park but this
 might destroy the rural appearance;   
 tennis courts would add to the amenit-
 ies. It is undesirable to re-route the
 service bus through the village but a 
 mini-bus would be an asset.  Future   
 Plans: The Parish Council will support
 suitable building applications, study 
 the feasibility of a mini-bus, improve
 parking and consider more social      
 events and recreational facilities.
