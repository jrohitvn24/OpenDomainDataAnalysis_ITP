		<content> High Ercall County Primary School     
 was erected in 1870. The old buildings
 still remain in use, but the school   
 has grown in size by the addition of a
 new open plan infant block 15 years   
 ago. There is a hard surfaced         
 playground and lots of grass playing  
 fields. In 1985 there are 106 pupils  
 and 5 teachers including the          
 Headmaster. School meals are cooked in
 the school kitchen and cost 60p a     
 day. There is no school uniform. When 
 children are 11 years old of age they 
 leave the village by bus and travel to
 Comprehensive schools in Wellington.  
 Children from Roden go to a school in 
 Shrewsbury. The school has a Parent   
 Teachers Association which raises     
 funds for the school.
