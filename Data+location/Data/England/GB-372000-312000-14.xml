		<content> Lilleshall Hall National Sports'      
 Centre is situated in the Hall once   
 owned by the Duke of Sutherland and   
 his family. The Centre still has much 
 of the character of the old hall but  
 has been much extended and modernised 
 in the last 10 years. It now caters   
 for a vast range of sporting          
 activities including, soccer, tennis, 
 badminton, squash and gymnastics for  
 use by the local population and more  
 especially for people who wish to     
 attend courses in the skills and      
 management of specific sports. Many of
 the facilities are housed in indoor   
 sports' halls with changing facilities
 and social amenities including a bar  
 and residential quarters. The grounds 
 are extensive and include examples of 
 many old, rare and beautiful trees.   
 Next door to the Centre is the        
 privately owned Lilleshall Golf Club. </content>
