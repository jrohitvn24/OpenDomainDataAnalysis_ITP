		<content>     Although the villages of Hundleby 
 and Raithby are close together, they  
 have very different styles of housing.
 Hundleby has terraces of town houses, 
 some of three storeys. In addition    
 there are a number of small terraced  
 cottages, formerly associated with the
 local industries of brewery and brick_
 works.                                
     Raithby, as befits an 'estate     
 village' has a fine Hall with well    
 laid out grounds of some 30 acres,    
 several attractive detached houses,   
 and pairs of cottages, all in matching
 style.                                
     Both villages have some local     
 authority housing and there has been  
 general infilling with modern property
 _ mainly bungalows.Many of the older  
 properties are built of the local     
 Hundleby bricks with slate or tile    
 roofs.                                </content>
