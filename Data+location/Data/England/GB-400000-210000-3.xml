		<title>03Farms-size and buildings</title>
		<content>In this farming area there were about  
10 farms.The smallest was 120 hectares 
&amp; the biggest 320.These were well above
the national average of 60 hectares.   
 In this landscape farms range in      
height from 148m in Churn Valley up to 
250m at plateau level.One farmer was   
renting out his grazing land.Older farm
buildings were of limestone which came 
from the local disused quarrys.Newer   
buildings were usually barns &amp; places  
to store tractors,combines etc.New     
buildings are made of materials like   
concrete blocks,sheet steel,           
corrigated iron &amp; some may have timber 
cladding on the outside to enhance the 
appearance.Several farms have grain    
silos.Lots of places are used to keep  
cows in the winter &amp; to protect &amp; store
machinery.Some farms were very long    
established.One farmhouse was 750 years
old.                                   </content>
