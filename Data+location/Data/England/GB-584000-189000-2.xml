		<content> I enjoy playing snooker and pool.     
 They are my best sports and enjoyment,
 followed by drawing and modern music  
 and long walks. My Mum enjoys drawing 
 hard pictures and reading books and   
 doing puzzles (She can do the Rubic   
 cube in three minutes). My Dad enjoys 
 sitting down with the newspaper but he
 also rides a bike and he likes playing
 snooker with me. I have a sports      
 centre round the corner to me that is 
 very handy to go to. I also watch a   
 lot of television and so do all the   
 rest of my family. But I am the most  
 interested in the television. I       
 calculated that I watch about 21 hours
 of television a week which on average 
 works out to about 3 hours a day. My  
 friend Steven enjoys all sports too,  
 especially swimming and football.  He 
 watches the same amount of television 
 as me, so do most people in the class.</content>
