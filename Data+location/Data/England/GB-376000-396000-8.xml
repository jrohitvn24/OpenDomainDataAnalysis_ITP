		<title>08Eccles Recreation Ground</title>
		<content> The recreation ground is one of the   
 few open spaces in the centre of      
 Eccles. It stands on what used to be  
 the old Cricket Ground. It is used by 
 a lot of people today, both young and 
 old.                                  
                                       
 First of all there is a playground for
 young children, with swings, slides   
 and roundabouts. For people who want  
 to play sports there are two football 
 pitches, tennis courts and bowling    
 greens.                               
                                       
 The football pitches are shared       
 between school and adult teams. This  
 means that they are used a lot and are
 a bit too big for schools. The bowling
 greens are very popular with old folk.
 Quite a lot of people use the park to 
 run in. Many people think that the    
 biggest problem in the park is dogs.  </content>
