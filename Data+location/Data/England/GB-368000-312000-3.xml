		<title>03AMBULANCE STATION,DONNINGTON</title>
		<content> The ambulance station is situated on  
 Wrekin Drive,by the Health Centre.It  
 was built less than ten years ago and 
 houses four vehicles.The ambulances   
 take patients from north and central  
 areas of Telford to hospitals in      
 Wellington and Shrewsbury.Accident    
 victims have to be taken to the Royal 
 Shrewsbury Hospital 14 miles away.    
 Building has recently begun on the    
 much-needed Telford Hospital.         
    The ambulances are manned by three 
 shifts of drivers during each 24 hour 
 period.The station is one of only 3 in
 in the Telford area, the others being 
 at Wellington and Madeley.Between them
 they have to have at least one vehicle
 available at all times in case of an  
 accident on the M54 motorway.If all   
 ambulances are in use one has to be   
 transferred from Shrewsbury on stand- 
 by duty.                              </content>
