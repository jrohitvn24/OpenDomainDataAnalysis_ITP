 Religion appears to have always been  
 an important aspect of village life   
 centred round the village church.     
{St. Oswald's Parish Church:-          
 The church is dedicated to St.Oswald  
 one of the founders of Christianity in
 Northern England.There is evidence to 
 suggest that there has been a church  
 at Lythe since about 900 A.D. Stones  
 of Anglo-Danish origin are on display 
 at the back of the present church.With
 the coming of prosperity in the form  
 of the Alum Works in the early 1600s  
 the silver Chalice and Paten were     
 presented to the church.At this time  
 records show that the church was one  
 of the most well attended in the North
 Riding.The church was extensively     
 restored to its medieval beauty in    
 1910.                                 </content>
