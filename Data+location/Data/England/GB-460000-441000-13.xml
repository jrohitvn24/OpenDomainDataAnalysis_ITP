		<content> The only church in our area is        
 St.Helen's Church of England Church   
 at Escrick.It is the second church to 
 be erected on the site,and was built  
 in 1857.The parish also includes the  
 villages of Naburn and Stillingfleet, 
 the rector,the Reverend Harris taking 
 services in each of the churches in   
 his parish every Sunday and at other  
 times during the week.He welcomes     
 people of all denominations at his    
 services,appreciating the needs of    
 those of other faiths who do not have 
 a local church.St.Helen's has a set of
 8 bells,but there is not a local team 
 of campanologists.There is a lych gate
 leading to the church yard,where some 
 lovely trees grow.St.Helen's has      
 recently reverted to the mediaeval    
 tradition of using the parish church  
 for social gatherings,such as the     
 Harvest Supper and musical concerts.  </content>
