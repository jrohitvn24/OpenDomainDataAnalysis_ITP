		<content> FARMING.                              
 Dr. Shelley is trying to restore      
 Shobrooke Park Farm as it has not been
 touched for 100 years.                
 The entrance to the park when he came 
 was all unlevel and rough so he grew  
 corn and then levelled it off, left it
 and it would turn into grass. He had a
 farming partner called (PETER COLEMAN 
 and together they own about 400 sheep 
 and 100 cattle. The cattle were eating
 the beech and oak shoots and they are 
 poisonous and very dangerous to the   
 animals, three died and alot had      
 terrible pains in their stomachs. He  
 had built a farm house and you could  
 hardly see it. Alot of the fields are 
 being ploughed and re-seeded with     
 trees. Dr. Shelley is planting alot of
 corn for corn fields and grass fields 
 too.
