		<content> The main railway line is controlled by
 two signal boxes. The line is now     
 electified. Three Bridges now has a   
 computerised system. There is a big   
 screen where you can chart up trains  
 and see where they are. They can chart
 up trains from Norwood Junction to    
 Brighton. Other stations can send     
 messages through a Telex machine.     
 There was abig dashboard with lots of 
 buttons. There was a recorded message 
 button but if that went wrong someone 
 could speak through a microphone. The 
 indicator board tells you what trains 
 are coming and going and where they   
 are stopping. The man let Edward speak
 through a micreophone and I pressed a 
 button to start a recorded message. I 
 thought it was great fun.
