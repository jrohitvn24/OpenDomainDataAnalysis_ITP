		<title>08SLOUGH INDUSTRIAL ESTATE</title>
		<content>  Slough Industrial Estate was         
 originally farmland.It began with a   
 purchase by the government of 600     
 acres in 1917.The estate was built for
 repairing war vehicles and making     
 defence weapons.In 1920 it was sold to
 private owners.A power station and    
 reservoir were built for the estate   
 alone.Today the estate consists of    
 485 acres and being one of the largest
 in the world,there are over 300       
 companies approx. 24,000 workers.It   
 consumes 3 million gallons of water   
 per day.The largest company is Mars,  
 but there are many more companies     
 producing goods such as computers,    
 videos etc.The area is now sometimes  
 called the 'Silicon Valley' because of
 all the high-technology equipment     
 produced.
