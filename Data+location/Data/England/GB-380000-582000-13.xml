		<title>13BELLINGHAM SOCIETIES.</title>
		<content> There are several societies in        
 Bellingham which provide for the arts.
 The{choral society}performs in village
 halls and churches throughout the     
 area. There are about 40 members.     
 The{Dramatic Society}caters for the   
 whole district and produces 2 or 3    
 plays each year. The most recent was  
 staged in the mart ring. It is a very 
 active society with about 30 members. 
 The strangest society is the{North    
{Tyne and Redeswater Twisty Roads      
{Preservation Society,}which was       
 started in 1974 by a group of local   
 people to assist various local causes.
 As worthy groups became in need of    
 extra equipment the Twisty Roaders    
 raised money to purchase whatever was 
 necessary by organising original      
 events. Their headquarters is the     
 residents lounge of the Cheviot Hotel.
