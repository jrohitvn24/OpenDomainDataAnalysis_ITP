 About 200 metres beyond Waugh's Well  
 the Rossendale Way path passes a mound
 of stone and red brick, making the    
 site of Fo Edge Farm.                 
    "Fo" means "Fall" and Fo Edge Farm 
 was demolished by the North West Water
 Authority in 1979, having been        
 derelict for some years previously.   
 Thus a famous historical site had     
 fallen and many of the local people we
 talked to  regretted the fact. One    
 keen rambler told us that the sight   
 should have been left, the farm-house 
 restored and and possibly developed to
 act as a resting place along the      
 Rossendale Way providing light        
 refreshments for the ever increasing  
 number of passers by.
