		<title>03The Greenham Peace Camp</title>
		<content>{     On the news the women of Greenham
{Peace Camp appear to be causing       
{trouble by breaking into the air base 
{at Greenham Common. They are also in  
{court quite often on various small    
{charges. The image created by the     
{media is sometimes even violent.      
{     During our study of this area we 
{visited the camp to take some         
{photographs. We spoke to the women who
{were present on that day, Monday 1st  
{July 1985, and they were very         
{different from what we had expected.  
{They were polite and friendly, they   
{chatted about the survey and joked    
{about the term 'Domesday'.            
{     They explained that they were    
{simply demonstrating their point of   
{view about nuclear missiles, and were 
{often upset by their public image.
