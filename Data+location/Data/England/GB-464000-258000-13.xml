		<title>13ROADWORKS ON THE M1</title>
		<content>At Upper Heyford, Tarmac Construction  
have had a depot for the reconstruction
of the M1. The M1 had a design life    
based on the traffic it was expected to
carry. It was built in 1959 and it has 
lasted 6 more years than it was meant  
to. Also with the increase in traffic  
and the weight of the lorries the M1   
has carried 5 times the traffic it was 
meant to carry. The existing motorway  
{pavement} has not been able to accept 
the very heavy traffic load and it is  
breaking up. The drains and culverts   
and the bridges are being damaged by   
rain and road salt. Tarmac started work
on one 10 mile section of the          
carriageway on the 2nd March 85 and    
finished work on the 23rd June; it cost
7 million pounds. They worked in       
shifts, 24 hrs a day, 7 days a week.   
There were 20 staff &amp; up to 160 machine
operators &amp; labourers involved.        </content>
