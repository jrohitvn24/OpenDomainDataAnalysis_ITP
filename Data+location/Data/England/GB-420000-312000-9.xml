		<content>     At 7.30a.m. I wake and then rouse 
my Mum. We go downstairs and I have my 
breakfast of Farmhouse Bran, honey and 
nuts, and a piece of toast with        
Marmite.I have a wash, brush my teeth  
and hair, and then get dressed in my   
jeans and jumper.I pack my bag and walk
to school.                             
   At 9 o'clock the teacher rings the  
bell and we go into school and hang our
bags and coats on our pegs.Our teacher 
calls the register,and after saying our
prayers we write a story until playtime
at 10.30.On rainy days we stay inside  
and play cards or snakes and ladders,  
but when it is fine we play            
outside.When the bell rings I go to the
toilet, wash my hands and go to        
lessons.                               
   We eat our lunch at 12 o'clock.I    
bring sandwiches from home and eat them
after we have said grace.              </content>
