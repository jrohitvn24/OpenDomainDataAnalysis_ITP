		<title>17Clubs - At the Golf Club</title>
		<content>" Priors Hall Golf Club is hidden      
behind trees near the A43.The course   
fees are 220p for 18 holes on          
weekdays,&amp; 320p at weekends.This money 
is paid to the club professional..who  
runs the golf shop sited near the      
first tee.Here the golfer can buy      
everything from a set of clubs to      
golfing socks. As so many people play  
on the course,an order of play has to  
be arranged.When golfers arrive they   
place a ball in a shute, and the order 
of the balls denotes the order of play.
Players usually go round the course in 
groups of 2,3 or 4..and a game lasts   
between 3 &amp; 4 hours,depending on the   
players ability.                       
On completion of play,it is possible to
enjoy a drink or a meal in the club    
house,which has panoramic views over   
the course."    ....account provided by
