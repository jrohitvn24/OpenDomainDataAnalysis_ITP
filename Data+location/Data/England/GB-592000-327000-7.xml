		<content> The Police Station was built in 1955, 
 and has 3 cells. 1 Inspector, 2       
 Sergeants and 11 Police Constables    
 work 8hr. shifts, starting at 08.00   
 and 16.00. Night shift is 23.00-07.00,
 worked on a rota system. 2-4 officers 
 are on duty at any time. The Fakenham 
 division reaches as far as Snoring (N)
 Colkirk (S), Sculthorpe (W) and       
 Fulmodstone (E), and deals with crimes
 (minor theft - murder), sudden deaths,
 traffic accidents, domestic disputes  
 and lost and found animals and        
 property. The nearest CID unit is at  
 Sheringham. We have 2 police cars - a 
 Ford Escort and a Vauxhall Chevette - 
 and 1 pedal cycle. We have a community
 relations officer. Guns are kept at   
 North Walsham. This year we gained a  
 police dog and handler. So far this   
 year 180 arrests have been made. In a 
 crisis the men may help another area. </content>
