		<title>13SHOPPING IN GRETTON</title>
		<content>                                       
   For a small village, shopping       
facilities in Gretton are very good.   
It has four shops - the Cooperative    
Store, Post Office, a hairdresser's    
and a newsagent's.  The Cooperative    
sells a large variety of household     
goods such as food, sweets, canned     
goods and washing powders.  The Post   
Office is also a general store selling 
a smaller range of foodstuffs and      
stationery.  The newsagent's sells many
lines other than papers and stationery.
There are also three vans which deliver
around the village during the week - a 
butcher with a large selection of      
meats, a grocer selling greengrocery in
addition to the usual lines and a baker
with a choice of bread.
