I like to play with my brothers.I go to
feed my rabbit.I go to play with       
Steven and Royston. I go home for tea  
and I go to bed. In the morning I wash 
the dishes.                            
I help to feed Kitty. I feed Donna     
with  baby food.                       
Sometimes I help my mummy to wash and  
dust. I make my cats egg and I give him
fresh water to drink. My pet is a cat. 
I comb him every day. Sometimes I comb 
him two times a day. His name is Oscar.
I do the gardening by watering the     
tomato plants and putting seeds in     
because they turn in to lovely         
flowers. I like helping mummy getting  
the table laid because mummy  always   
says get the knives and forks out and  
get the salt and pepper out.Daddy says 
pepper makes you sneeze.
