		<content> The harvest home is for celebrating   
 and thanking god for harvest and hay  
 making. During the Harvest Home       
 there is a Church service,a lunch     
 tea,a procession,a fair,and a disco to
 which anybody can go.Early every year 
 we have a disco to choose a Harvest   
 Home Queen.The Harvest Home Committee 
 organises these events.The Harvest    
 Home started many years ago.Nearly    
 every year they have at least 500 to  
 600 people attend.The organisers say  
 that it will never be too expensive to
 hold.At the fair of the Harvest Home  
 we have many rides and the tea tent is
 enormous.There are also a lot of      
 stalls and at 7.00pm the procession   
 comes through.One of the nicer        
 customs!
