 feature of our village.It stands      
 upright in the middle of the village  
 for all to see.The church is made of  
 chalky white stone from Tadcaster     
 quarries.It is crumbling and cracking.
 On the outside there are              
 gargoyles.They are made of stone and  
 are covered in moss and bird          
 droppings.Some windows are made from  
 coloured glass.The church has big     
 steel doors that have rust round the  
 edges.The graveyard surrounding the   
 church is in two parts.One is very old
 dating back a long way and the other  
 is quite new.                         
 Inside the chancel,where the choir    
 and clergy sit,is an ancient          
{misericord.}However the most important
 feature of the church is its{spire    
 which is reputed to be the tallest    
 spire of a parish church in the north.</content>
