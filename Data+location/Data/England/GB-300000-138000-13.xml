		<title>13HOW MY DAD EARNS HIS LIVING.</title>
		<content> My dad is an artist. He paints        
 landscapes or just messy shapes. He   
 also carves and draws. He has to      
 carve house signs and gravestones to  
 sell so he has enough money to buy    
 paints and brushes. He works at home  
 in the pump room of our very old      
 house. If it is hot he works outside. 
 He gets up about eight o'clock which  
 is fairly early most days. Every      
 afternoon he tries to take Bonny, my  
 puppy, for a walk. So he can't please 
 himself and have a break at any time  
 but he occasionally has the day off.  
 Then he goes to{London}or{Bristol}to  
 sell his paintings to the galleries.  
 He used to run a modelling and        
 painting class. He paints on canvas or
 on paper in a frame. First of all he  
 sketches on a pad. Usually its things 
 like trees or fields or country       
 scenes. I know he enjoys his work.    </content>
