		<content>  The Brownie Pack in Clipston has     
about 15 members.  They meet in the    
school hall each Monday evening at     
6:30 until 7:30.  The uniform they     
wear is a brown dress with a yellow    
kerchief, a brown knitted hat, and     
a leather belt which has a small       
purse attached to it.                  
  When everyone is gathered together we
sing the traditional song, and give in 
our weekly subs.  Then we go to our    
packs, they are Elves, Kingfishers,    
Gnomes and Bluebells.  Each pack has   
a sixer and seconder, they tell us what
we are going to do for the evening.  We
usually make things like lavendar bags 
or small dolls, and then we have some  
games before we all gather together    
again to close the meeting.  We end the
evening with another traditional song  
that is called Brownie Bells, and      
salute the Brown Owl before going home.</content>
