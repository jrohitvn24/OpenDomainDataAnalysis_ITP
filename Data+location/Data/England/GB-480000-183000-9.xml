{  }The grounds of the house,built     
 between 1899-1901,sweep down to the   
 Thames.The estate has 63              
 acres,including 30 acres of woodland,a
 swimming pool and tennis court.It was 
 built for a Midlands millionaire but  
 is now office accommodation for       
 Carnation Food products who employ 180
 staff.As Carnation have been taken    
 over by Nestles the building will be  
 up for sale.                          
{WITTINGTON HOUSE                      
    It was formerly built by a biscuit 
 magnate as a private residence.Until  
 recently it has been rented by The    
 Salvation Army and run as an old      
 peoples home.It is currently up for   
 sale and will probably be used for    
 office accommodation.
