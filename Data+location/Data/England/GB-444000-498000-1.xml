		<title>01SUMMARY OF THE AREA.</title>
		<content> The D-block 04440498 lies 12 miles    
 south of Middlesbrough and 6 miles    
 north-east of Northallerton.Three     
 quarters of the D-block lies within   
 the North York Moors National Park.   
 From the flat plains leading to       
 Teesside, the land rises steeply to a 
 moorland area which reaches 300 metres
 above sea level.On the steep-sided    
 hills grow mainly conifers. Some of   
 these wooded areas belong to the      
 Forestry Commision.The moorland is    
 covered by bracken, heather and rough 
 grassland.This area is composed of    
 thick sandstones from the Deltaic     
 series but during glacial times melt  
 water poured over and these overflow  
 channels are now valleys within the   
 moorland.The area is rural and chiefly
 devoted to farming.Ingleby Arncliffe  
 in the north-west corner is mainly a  
 commuter village for Teesside.        </content>
