		<title>14COLYTON CARNIVAL</title>
		<content> Every year in September, Colyton holds
 a carnival. There is a carnival parade
 on the Saturday evening, in which     
 floats from several other East Devon  
 towns take part. The Carnival Queen is
 crowned in a special ceremony and then
 all the floats and other competitors  
 walk around the streets of Colyton    
 while some people collect money which 
 is used for charities or local        
 improvements such as a cover for the  
 primary school's swimming pool. There 
 are prizes for the best floats and    
 costumes. Besides the procession,     
 there is also a "Petticoat Lane"      
 street market selling all kinds of    
 articles. In the week before the      
 Carnival procession there are other   
 events such as competitions, displays,
 a street party etc., all aimed at     
 raising money. Often several thousand 
 pounds are raised from the carnival.  </content>
