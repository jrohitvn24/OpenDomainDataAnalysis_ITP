		<title>11A DAY IN MY LIFE</title>
		<content> Last summer I went to{Birkenhead}for  
 the day with my family. We went by car
 using one of the{Mersey Tunnels.}When 
 we arrived we went straight to the    
 amusement arcade. We played on all    
 types of games including the{fruit    
{machines}and while we played my mum   
 and dad went to the pub for a drink.  
 We bought chips and drinks from a chip
 shop for our dinner and ate them      
 sitting on a bench by the sea. Later  
 we went down to the beach to look for 
 crabs and mussels. We found lots of   
 mussels which we put in a bag and     
 later took home. We brushed all the   
 sand off our feet and clothes before  
 getting into the car to go home. We   
 arrived home, had something to eat and
 watched television. I enjoyed that day
 out.
