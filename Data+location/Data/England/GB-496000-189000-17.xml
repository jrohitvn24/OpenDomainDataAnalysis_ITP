30-40 acres woodland, 40 acres of      
orchards including {plums}, {damsons}  
and {cherries}. 30 acres of oats and   
barley which is grown to sell and not  
for the animals' fodder.The remaining  
area of grass is chopped into hay,     
also for sale.They have a small flock  
of {sheep}. Contractors do the fruit   
picking and heavy work. The            
contractors are modern.Another farm    
visited was Packwood, a modern farm    
built in 1977. The farm is a           
combination of cattle, dairy and       
arable. A few cattle are raised for    
beef, but mainly the livestock is for  
dairy purposes. Mumfords Farm, a       
mainly arable farm is in the process   
of being broken up and a considerable  
amount of the land has been bought by  
the owner of Packwood Farm.
