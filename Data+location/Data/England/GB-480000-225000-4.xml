		<title>04The School Building</title>
		<content>   My school,Swanbourne C.of E.First   
School,was built in 1832 with 3        
classrooms. In 1963 one classroom was  
changed into an office and a staff     
toilet and a store-room and a corridor 
leading to a new cloakroom, classroom  
and kitchen. This was because Little   
Horwood School closed and the children 
came here.My classroom is the biggest  
room in the old building. It is 7.5m x 
6m and there are 19 children in the    
class.  There is a glass folding       
partition  between my class and the    
next classroom. The middle classroom   
is 4.5m x 7.5m and it is used for      
Physical Education,drama,television,   
painting,and the library.The new class-
room is 9m x 7.5m and is used for      
Assembly,dinners,P.E.,concerts,and     
meetings.20 children work in this room.
Outside is a shed which has been turned
into a playhouse.                      </content>
