		<content>Our educational aims are to :1) Help   
each child to feel secure and happy in 
school. 2) Ensure that all children    
are actively involved in their day at  
school. 3) Help develop the individual 
potential of each child, particularly  
in the areas of language, number,      
creative work and scientific enquiry.  
4) Develop the social and moral        
potential of each child in a caring    
community. 5) Help each child to       
understand the religious dimension in  
his life with explicit reference to    
the bible. 6) Help each child to       
develop independence and               
self-reliance, and so increase in      
confidence. 7) Work for a partnership  
between home and school in caring for  
the child. 8) Provide an attractive,   
stimulating environment in and around  
the school building. 9) To involve the 
village community in school life.      </content>
