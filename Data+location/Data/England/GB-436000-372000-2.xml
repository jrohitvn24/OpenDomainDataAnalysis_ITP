		<content> Dunston Hall, a country house of 17th 
 century origin, situated in 4 acres of
 land to the north of Chesterfield. It 
 was bought by Richard Milnes, Mayor in
 1626, &amp; still in the family in 1809.  
 In 1670 it is described as comfortable
 &amp; well furnished wtih many tables,    
 chairs, chests &amp; elaborate beds. The  
 adjacent farm provided most of the    
 food &amp; fifty acres of hay &amp; corn grew 
 in the fields around.                 
  The Hall was purchased in 1978 by Mr.
 and Mrs. J.E. Parkinson. The west wing
 which had been burnt down many years  
 before has been rebuilt by them. Also 
 the Cruck Barn has been renovated and 
 is now used as business offices.      
  In 1985 the house is occupied by Mr. 
 and Mrs. Parkinson with their four    
 children and two grandparents.
