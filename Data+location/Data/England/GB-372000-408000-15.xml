		<title>15PARK COTTAGE-'TWO CATS'</title>
		<content> Park Cottage on Radcliffe Road is     
 given the name 'Two Cats' because the 
 Bradford coats of arms which are in   
 the gables and bear the date 1854 have
 two leopards supporting them.         
 The cottage is in the Gothic style and
 was originally built as a park keepers
 lodge. It has a steep roof which has  
 fishtailed slates and it is the only  
 relic which remains of Bolton's first 
 park which was made by the Earl of    
 Bradford and later closed by him.     
 Fred Dibnah, the steeplejack now lives
 there, who is one of Bolton's most    
 famous characters, both for his       
 unusual job, and his hobby of         
 restoring old steam engines and steam 
 tractors in large sheds behind his    
 house. He bought the property in 1967 
 for Â£5,000 and he has since built a   
 rear extension.
