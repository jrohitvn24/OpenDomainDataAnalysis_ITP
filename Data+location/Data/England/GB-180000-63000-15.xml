		<content> It was found that first a trench was  
 dug, then flat blocks were put in the 
 trench at right angles to the sides.  
 This trench was then filled with      
 anything that was at hand-mainly      
 rubbish, such as bones, sand and      
 pebbles. They were then build up to   
 enormous sizes. There were also       
 several smelting holes found -along   
 with many pieces of slag, particularly
 in the ramparts. The finds made by    
 Croft Andrews are apparently scattered
 across Britain some being in Truro    
 Museum, the others are supposedly in  
 Croft Andrew's own private collection 
 in Yorkshire.Trevelgue is thought to  
 be one of the most important Iron Age 
 site in Cornwall.
