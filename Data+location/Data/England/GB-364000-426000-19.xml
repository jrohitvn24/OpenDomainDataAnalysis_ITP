		<title>19CHINESE COMMUNITY,MILL HILL.</title>
		<content> In{January},1985,a{House of Commons}  
 report highlighted the{Chinese}as the 
 most{neglected}of our ethnic{         
{minorities,}and within days the local 
 Chinese,led by{Hon Tin Fu},had        
 negotiated with{Mary Chadwick},the{   
{Community Centre Warden,}for the use  
 of the building every Sunday.Within   
 three weeks a{school}teaching{Chinese 
{language and culture}to{children}was  
 operational.As parents were native    
 speaking,Catonese,Vietnamese or Hakka 
 (the dialect of Hong Kong)and many had
 limited English,{classes for adults}  
 also started teaching English. Parents
 had to bring children,and used the    
 waiting time for {social and          
{recreational}purposes eg.playing      
 Mah-Jong,Chinese chess and card games 
 ,snooker,table tennis etc.This led to 
 the formation of the{Chinese Community
{Association}which supports the sick.  </content>
