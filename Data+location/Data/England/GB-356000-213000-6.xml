		<title>06A Day in my life</title>
		<content> At 8 am. I get up and brush my teeth  
 afterwards I get dressed.I have my    
 breakfast which is usually toast or a 
 choice of cereals with a drink.       
 I leave home about 8:45 am.           
 When I reach school I play in the     
 playground unless it is raining.      
 At 9am. the bell rings and everyone   
 hangs their coats up in the cloakroom 
 and goes into class and gets their    
 reading books out.                    
 After ten minutes reading we do some  
 work.                                 
 When Mrs. Loder tells us it is time   
 for play we have our milk and we rush 
 outside.                              
 We have half an hour play then we come
 in. We then work through to midday.
