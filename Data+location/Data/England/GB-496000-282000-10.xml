		<title>10A MANCUNIAN IN SUDBOROUGH</title>
		<content> At the age of thirteen I moved from   
 Greater Manchester,Altrincham to      
 Sudborough in Northamptonshire. This  
 move was quite expensive and one I    
 could not accept at first. This I     
 think was because I had lived in a    
 busy town with a shopping-centre, lots
 of night clubs, an ice rink, cinemas  
 and more, and, most important in my   
 mind, friends and people of about my  
 own age. There areplenty of people my 
 age at my new school naturally, but   
 they live quite a long way from my    
 village. Sudborough has no bus routes 
 passing through, so without           
 private transport all you can do is   
 walk. This is another thing I found   
 extremely unusual because buses used  
 to pass every ten minutes in          
 Altrincham. Now I have to rely totally
 on my parents for transport to discos,
 parties or shops.                     </content>
