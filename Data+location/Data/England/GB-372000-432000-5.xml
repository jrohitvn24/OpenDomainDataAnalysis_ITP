 1877 WAS AN EVENTFUL YEAR FOR GT.     
 HARWOOD.IT WAS THE YEAR THAT THE      
 LOOP LINE FROM BLACKBURN TO GT.       
 HARWOOD,PADIHAM AND ROSE GROVE        
 WAS OPENED.AT THE OPENING A REPORTER  
 SAID,"THERE IS A GREAT NEED FOR THE   
 LINE,ESPECIALLY WITH THE MANUFACTURERS
 IN PADIHAM AND THE GROWING            
 POPULATION".THE ONLY WAY TO TAKE GOODS
 OUT OF TOWN BEFORE THE OPENING WAS BY 
 HORSE AND CART OR BY LORRY.THE NEAREST
 RAILWAY WAS AT RISHTON AND WAS OPENED 
 IN 1848. THE RAILWAY WAS A GREAT      
 ADDITION TO GT.HARWOOD.THE RAILWAY WAS
 CLOSED IN 1957 AND NOW THE STATION HAS
 GONE AND MANY OF THE CUTTINGS HAVE    
 BEEN FILLED IN.
