		<title>17The Valley Floor</title>
		<content>  The flood plain of the river Ouse    
is just over half a kilometre wide and 
it runs south between steeply sloping  
hills both east and west.              
  As recently as 1900 the whole valley 
floor (known locally as 'the brooks')  
was covered by water meadows and were  
flooded for most of the winter months. 
  A network of drains now keeps the    
fields dry, but almost all are still   
pasture (flood plain soils are         
generally fertile alluvium, but there  
is much coarse gravel and heavy clay   
here too.)                             
  The river Ouse is in a course that   
swings from one side of the flood-plain
to the other between high man-made     
banks or levees of crushed chalk.      
  The valley is a narrow routeway,     
with two roads, a railway and a double 
line of electricity pylons all within  
half a kilometre of Deans Farm.        </content>
