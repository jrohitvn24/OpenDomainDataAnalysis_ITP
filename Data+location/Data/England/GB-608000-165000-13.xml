		<content> We interviewed a lady who has lived in
 Whitstable for about 60 years. This is
 what she said,"Children were at school
 until the age 14,classes were larger  
 and the work less varied and there was
 less choice of schools.During the war 
 men were in the services so women had 
 to do the mens work.Many people were  
 involved in the fishing industry,     
 especially in shellfish.Whitstable    
 used to be a small town, not many     
 people had cars but now most people   
 drive to work and many families have  
 two cars.Trains ran more frequently   
 and there was a train service between 
 Whitstable and Canterbury.The shops   
 were small and more varied, there were
 no supermarkets and the only takeaway 
 food shop was fish and chips.Food was 
 rationed but people ate a healthier   
 diet.The town has grown in size but   
 has still retained its character."    </content>
