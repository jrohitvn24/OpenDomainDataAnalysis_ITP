		<title>17Community Relations</title>
		<content> With perhaps one exception there is a 
 strong community feeling. It is 'a    
 friendly place to live' with 'good    
 neighbours who can be relied on in a  
 crisis'. The sense of community is    
 built around the churches, pubs &amp;     
 schools &amp; is fostered by the 2 parish 
 magazines. These are widely read &amp; are
 the main vehicles for keeping in touch
 with what is going on. The exception  
 is the ambivalent feeling towards one 
 of the 2 council estates in Walkern   
 where the E Herts Council have brought
 in 'outsiders'. As in most villages   
 there are contributers &amp; non contrib- 
 uters &amp; a high gossip level but there 
 is also a high tolerance level for non
 conforming behaviour. Newcomers find  
 that it takes time to become accepted 
 (at least 10 yrs) but are generally   
 made welcome if an effort is made to  
 become involved in the community.     </content>
