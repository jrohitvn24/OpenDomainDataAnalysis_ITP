		<content>{Susie:}The best thing about my home is
 the settee in the living room.  When I
 sit on it I feel safe and warm and    
 cosy. {Jacob:}My bedroom has a light  
 by the side of my bed so I feel cosy  
 and I can switch it on if I feel      
 creepy at night. {Kate:}My cooker in  
 the kitchen can boil four lots of     
 vegetables on top and roast meat in   
 the oven at the same time. {Gillian:}I
 help Mummy get the dinner ready.  I   
 peel potatoes to boil and Mummy cooks 
 the meat. {Rebecca:}My favourite meal 
 is chicken and chips.  These are      
 chopped up potatoes fried in oil.{    
{Christopher:}My pet dog has to be fed 
 with meat and hard biscuits and water.
 I brush his hairy body to keep it     
 clean. {Kirsty:}If my dog gets muddy I
 bath him.  I take him for long walks  
 to keep him fit.
