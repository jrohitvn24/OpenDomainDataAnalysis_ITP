		<title>01The Wentworth Area</title>
		<content> The area around Wentworth is mainly   
{farmland.}There are quite a few       
 different farms but most of the land  
 is still owned by{Wentworth Estates.  
 Most of the new building in the area  
 is at{Thorpe Hesley}and this is mostly
 private housing estates. There is very
 little new building in{Wentworth      
 village because the whole village is  
 owned by the estate.{Harley}is the    
 smallest of the villages in the area  
 and there is a mixture of old and new 
 building.The farming land is a mixture
 of cattle and crops and it is a very  
 pretty area. The main historic        
 building in the area is{Wentworth     
{Woodhouse.}Now the area is starting to
 attract tourists so craft and gift    
 shops are starting to open.
