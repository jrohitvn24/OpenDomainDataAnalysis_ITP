		<title>14Interview With Mr Cann</title>
		<content> Mr Cann first came to Stanton         
 St Quintin in 1939, he lived in       
 Chippenham before he moved here in    
 1976. He came here because he was in  
 the{R.A.F.}Mr Cann was an aeroplane   
 fitter. Mr Cann told us a story.      
 One day war was declared. Mr Cann was 
 down in the dip, when someone shouted 
 "FIRE!"                               
 Some soldiers were training with an   
 old{cannon,}when they heard the shout 
 they let go of the rope, and then the 
 cannon went flying around every where,
 it was loaded as well. It fired over  
 Mr Cann's head, and{Mr Cousins}was in 
 his horse and cart, and it missed     
 him, and it was a direct hit on the   
{church tower.}Now there is a ring of  
 new stones on the tower where the     
 shell hit it.                         
                                       
                                       </content>
