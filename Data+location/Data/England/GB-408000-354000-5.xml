		<title>05My visit to Wetton Mill</title>
		<content>     At Wetton Mill in the Manifold    
Valley, they have a shop and a camp    
site.  They get lots of tourists all   
year round but they get a lot more in  
summer and very few in winter.  They   
open the shop every day of the week.   
     In winter it is very cold, but    
they don't get a lot of snow.          
     The land around Wetton Mill is    
hilly.  It is picturesque and has      
pleasant scenery.  It is partly        
woodland and partly rough grazing.     
     In the Manifold Valley there is   
Thor's Cave which is very ancient and  
was once lived in by animals and       
cavemen.  Access to the Manifold Valley
can be gained at Waterhouses and at    
Wetton Mill near the site of an old    
railway track which is now a cycle     
track.  The Manifold River goes        
underground to meet the River Dove.
