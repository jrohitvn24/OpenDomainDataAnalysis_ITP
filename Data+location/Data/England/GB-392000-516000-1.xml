		<title>01Baldersdale</title>
		<content> A tributary valley of Teesdale.       
 Baldersdale is characterised largely  
 by its reservoirs which have a total  
 area of 700 acres. The largest of     
 these, Balderhead reservoir, lies 1100
 feet above sea level. Although built  
 to supply water to Teesdale and       
 Darlington, the reservoirs also have  
 recreational use, for water skiing and
 fishing. On either side of the        
 reservoirs is a patchwork of fields   
 used for grazind and rearing of cattle
 and sheep. There are many stone walls 
 and scattered farmsteads, often       
 sheltered by clumps of deciduous      
 trees. A very minor road along each   
 side of the valley gives access to the
 farms and the reservoirs.
