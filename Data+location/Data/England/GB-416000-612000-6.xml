		<title>06THINGS I LIKE DOING</title>
		<content> These are some of the things I like   
 doing.  In winter I like sliding down 
 the slippery slope throwing snowballs 
 and skidding on the smooth ice.  I    
 like sitting beside the warm fire     
 eating buttered crumpets.  In the     
 spring I like skipping and playing    
 football.  I like playing games from  
 other countries at Brownies.  In      
 summer I like making daisy chains and 
 daisy caterpillars.  I like climbing  
 trees best in summer because all the  
 trees have got their leaves and nobody
 can see you.  In autumn I like to     
 shuffle through the leaves and throw  
 them high in the air.  At home on a   
 rainy day I like playing board games  
 like draughts, chess, Cluedo, Monopoly
 and Donkey Kong.  Also I like playing 
 with the computer.  We have got a ZX  
 Spectrum.                             
                                       </content>
