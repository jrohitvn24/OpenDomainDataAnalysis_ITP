		<title>18PUBLIC HOUSES IN BLOFIELD</title>
		<content>   There are now two public houses in  
 Blofield, the Globe and the Kings     
 Head, there used to be a third, the   
 Swan, but this closed down when the   
 landlord retired.  The Swan was       
 particularly popular among the older  
 local residents.                      
   The Globe is the largest and        
 specialises in serving seafood,       
 especially fresh fish, for people     
 coming from many miles around.  It    
 also often has live music groups as   
 well as a games room with pool,       
 snooker and video games.              
   The Kings head is a quieter pub and 
 caters for local residents.  They also
 serve a variety of traditional foods. 
   The pubs have not suffered greatly  
 from the opening of the By_pass as    
 thier reputations remain good.
