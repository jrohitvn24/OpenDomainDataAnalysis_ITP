		<title>02EDUCATION IN COLYTON</title>
		<content> There is a County Primary school in   
 Colyton with a Headmaster who teaches,
 3 full time teachers and one part time
 teacher. There are about 80 children  
 between the ages of 5 and 11. The     
 school has a swimming pool.           
 In their last year at primary school, 
 the children take an exam to decide   
 whether they should go on to the      
 Grammar School in Colyford or the     
 secondary school at Axminster. The    
 Grammar School was founded by the     
 Feoffees (see page 7) in the          
 sixteenth century and used to meet in 
 a building near Colyton Church until  
 1927. There have been discussions     
 about reorganising the secondary      
 schools for Colyton children into a   
 comprehensive system.                 
 Some children travel out of the area  
 to other schools at Sidmouth or to a  
 number of private schools.            </content>
