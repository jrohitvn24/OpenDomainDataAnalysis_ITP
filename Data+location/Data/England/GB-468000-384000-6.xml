		<title>06Day in the Life of Mr. Webb</title>
		<content> Mr. Webb lives in the old school house
 which is mid way between Sutton and   
 Lound.  He runs his own business      
 called Lound Garden Services.  He gets
 up each day about 7 o'clock and takes 
 the dogs for a walk.  Then he milks   
 the goats with his wife and feeds all 
 the animals.  After he has had his    
 breakfast he goes to work at Lound    
 Hall where he looks after the garden. 
 Sometimes he finds that the horse or  
 the sheep have eaten some of his      
 plants.  He goes home for his dinner  
 and he works in Sutton in the         
 afternoon.  He goes at 4.o'clock and  
 then does his own gardening.  He      
 sells a lot of bedding plants, celery,
 tomato plants and when the fruit is   
 ready he also sells that.  At night he
 milks and feeds the goats again.  He  
 sells the goats' milk.
