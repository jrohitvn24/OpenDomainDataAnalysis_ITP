 and a{Cairn}terrier called Sophie.    
 Penny is 13 and Sophie is 2.Sophie had
 5 puppies;1 died.We are selling the   
 boys for Â£95 each and the bitch for   
 Â£105.We are breeding Cairns and we    
 will buy a{Rottweiler}and breed from  
 her.We take them to match meetings    
 once a fortnight and for walks at     
 6.30,7.30 and 8.15am and at4pm,6pm &amp;  
 8pm.When I leave school I am going to 
 learn how to wash,clip and pluck dogs 
 and eventually my family want to own  
 some kennels.   LOUISE WARDMAN
