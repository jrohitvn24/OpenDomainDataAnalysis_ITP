		<content>  In our first square {A1}we find a    
 complete variation of house types and 
 ages of property.The area has older   
 property built in the 1930's which    
 comprise of semi-detatched houses and 
 bungalows.These are located very close
 to {Three Bridges Railway station}    
 which provided good links with both   
 London and the South Coast. The       
 streets in this part of the grid have 
 been named after poets {e.g. Byron    
{Close, Tennyson Closeand Wordsworth   
 Close. The more recent developments   
 having been built since {World War2}  
 are terraced or semi-detatched in     
 design and were originally built for  
 the {Commission of New Towns.}These   
 pro perties were originally rented to 
 families who moved to Crawley in the  
 1950's, however many have since been  
 purchased by the tenant.These homes   
 are near Crawley Industrial Estate.   </content>
