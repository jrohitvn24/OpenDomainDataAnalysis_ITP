		<title>02OUR ESTATE</title>
		<content> We live on the Warwick Estate,a large 
 council estate built about 20 years   
 ago.The houses are built in rows or   
 squares and are named after lakes or  
 trees.Despite the fact that the estate
 is fairly new much of it is dirty and 
 damaged due to vandalism and lack of  
 care,which is a pity for those people 
 who look after their property.There   
 are often silly fights over petty     
 things.There are no shops in our area 
 of the estate,which is inconvenient,  
 but a wide variety of mobile shops    
 visit each week.There is a working    
 mens club and a bookmakers on the     
 site next to our school.There is a    
 small area of playing fields nearby   
 but there is not a lot on it, much    
 having been destroyed by vandalism.   
 The tennis netting was ripped down,   
 some of the playground equipment burnt
 and the bowling green dug up.         </content>
