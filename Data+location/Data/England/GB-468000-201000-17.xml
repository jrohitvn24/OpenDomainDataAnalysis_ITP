		<title>17Copcourt Manor</title>
		<content>Copcourt Manor forms a small part of   
the Copcourt Estate. The house used to 
be a monastery and has a moat all      
around it. The moat is 3 to 4 metres   
wide and is quite deep. There are four 
bridges over the moat, one to each side
of the house. Most of the buildings are
old, some are green from water rising. 
The windows are old fashioned and at   
the front of the house apricot trees   
grow to the first storey. Across the   
moat are the stables and a beam in the 
stables has 1756 carved on it. They    
have eight eventing horses. Three of   
them are Apollo, Jack and Henry Horse. 
Jack is over seventeen hands high which
is very high for a horse. There is a   
tennis court which is often used.      
Copcourt Manor is a private residence.
