 of young families, the adults being   
 fairly affluent,unemployment not      
 seriously affecting their lives.

 is home orientated,including children 
 in daily activities,taking annual     
 holidays and      supporting children 
 in school and recreational activities.
 Many young families participate in    
 sporting activities using the         
 facilities at Stocksbridge,Sheffield  
 and Hillsborough.Gardening is a       
 weekend ritual undertaken by many     
 residents,the gardens always looking
