		<content> Birstall is a large residential       
 village in the Borough of Charnwood,  
 to the west of the Soar immediately   
 north of Leicester. Its extensive     
 housing estates run over into the     
 city.{The population is about 12,655  
 and the community is split by the A6  
 which links Leicester and             
 Loughborough.                         
    Our traffic census at its junction 
 with Greengate Lane showed{278        
{vehicles leaving Leicester and 676    
{heading towards Leicester}in a 30     
 minute period. 380 of these vehicles  
 were Heavy Goods Vehicles.            
    The Parish Council reported on     
 improvements to the sequencing of the 
 lights on 20.5.85. The only other     
 crossing point is opposite Johnson    
 Road. Pupils at Stonehill and         
 Longslade frequently cross the        
 dangerous dual carriageway section.   </content>
