		<content> For{Dairy}farmers the year begins when
 the cows are let out of their winter  
 quarters or{Shippon.}The calves are   
 usually born in the spring.A few hours
 after calving the calf is taken away  
 from its mother before the cow gets   
 too attached to her calf. When you are
 feeding the calf you must feed it on  
 its mother's fresh milk.There is one  
 main danger to a cow and that is{Milk 
{Fever.}This means that the cow cannot 
 be milked and you could lose the cow. 
 The cure is to feed your cow{calcium} 
 by using a needle and sticking it into
 a vein. Summer is very much like      
 spring in that calves are being born  
 and even more milk is being produced  
 because the grass is so lush.         
 In winter the cows are brought in     
 again to the{shippon}and fed on{silage
 that was made in the summer.
