		<title>12FARMING IN THE PAST</title>
		<content>                                       
 The original industry of the area     
 was farming.Farms were smaller and    
 more numerous.The work was done by the
 farmer and his family with help from  
 the odd farm labourer. The work was   
 labour intensive.Records in our school
 log book say "many children were      
 absent from school at harvest time    
 helping on the farm".All farms grew   
 cereals,root crops &amp; greens to feed   
 the animals in winter.They had grass  
 on which animals grazed &amp; some which  
 was cut for hay.All farms had sheep,  
 cows,pigs,horses,ducks,hens,geese &amp;   
 turkeys.Today there are fewer farms   
 but with much larger acreage.These are
 worked by a much smaller workforce.The
 work is still labour intensive but,   
 tractors and other machines have made 
 things easier.Today organic manure has
 been replaced by chemical fertilisers.</content>
