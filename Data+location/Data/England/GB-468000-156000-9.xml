{School.                               
 In Class 3{"Hey Presto"}is the most   
 popular with the girls and{"Football"}
 with the boys.                        
 How to play{"Hey Presto."             
 To play{"hey Presto,"}you mainly have 
 to be able to do a hand stand. Take   
 for instance{"Banana Split",}you go   
 into the normal hand stand position   
 and then you open your legs. The      
 person who is "it" then chooses the   
 person who was the best and then that 
 person becomes "it."                  
 There are lots of other games like {  
{"Stuck in the mud"}and{"Hop-scotch."} 
 When I go home I play games,such as { 
{"catch"}with my brother but he is not 
 a very fast runner.                   
 If I don't play a game I go inside and
 read or play my flute.
