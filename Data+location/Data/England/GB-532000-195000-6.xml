 Polytechnics in the country, with     
 6,500 full-time &amp; 2000 part-time      
 students. The Polytechnic has various 
 sites in North London.                
 The Ponders End site is on the        
 Hertford Rd., &amp; was formerly a large  
 house. Swan (the inventor of the light
 bulb) lived opposite the present site 
 &amp; invented the light bulb in the      
 basement of the old house.            
 Many different courses are run, over  
 130 at degree &amp; postgraduate level.   
 Social Sciences &amp; some Civil          
 Engineering courses are based at      
 Ponders End. There are full-time,     
 part-time &amp; block release courses.    
 The Swan Annexe is to be closed       
 shortly, through lack of money, and   
 its work will be incorporated in the  
 other main buildings in Ponders End.
