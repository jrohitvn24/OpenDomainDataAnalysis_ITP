		<title>02Employment in Greenhill</title>
		<content>    Greenhill is a small hamlet on high
 ground to the south west of Ringsbury 
 Camp. It is situated off the B4041    
 between Purton and Wootton Bassett.The
 community is small, the majority of   
 people having lived there all their   
 lives.                                
    Over the years new faces and       
 buildings have arrived in the area.   
 Until recently almost all the         
 employment revolved around the 3 farms
 whose land accounts for about 70% of  
 the acreage in Greenhill.             
    At the present time, in addition to
 the dairy farming there are other     
 employments in Greenhill. They are all
 associated with the land. There is a  
 firm of landscape gardeners providing 
 turfing and fencing. Also there is a  
 small nursery dealing in a wide       
 variety of trees, shrubs etc. Half an 
 acre is used for vegetables.          </content>
