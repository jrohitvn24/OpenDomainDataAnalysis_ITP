		<title>01PORTHLEVEN OUR VILLAGE</title>
		<content> Porthleven is a Cornish fishing       
 village on the south west coast of    
 Great Britain. We think we are very   
 lucky to live in such a lovely        
 village.                              
   People are friendly and most of us  
 live near our relations, which we     
 think is pleasant.                    
   Many of our homes have lovely views 
 of the sea, the coast and the harbour.
 Fishing boats leave from and return to
 the harbour.                          
   It is not as busy as it used to be  
 but there are about thirty small boats
 which mostly catch crabs. There are   
 large beaches. During the summer we   
 have many holiday makers. We enjoy    
 having them, also they bring money to 
 the area. During the summer the       
 beaches are crowded. The only thing   
 which worries us is cliff erosion.
