		<content> Glyndebourne is first and foremost a  
 family home. The present owners have  
 four children. It is quite an old     
 house built out of reddish brown      
 bricks. The windows are quite big with
 small panes. From the house we went   
 into the organ room, where people can 
 sit and wait. We walked through the   
 fire-place and were in the            
 opera-house. The opera-house is 51    
 years old. There are 830 seats        
 including the boxes. The cheapest     
 seats are Â£18 and the dearest Â£38. The
 season lasts two and a half months and
 when the opera was first built it was 
 only two weeks long. Many famous      
 singers and conductors started their  
 careers here. A house or flat nearby  
 has to be found for those taking      
 part in productions.
