		<title>02CARISBROOKE CASTLE</title>
		<content> Carisbrooke Castle is a Norman motte  
 and bailey castle with Elizabethan    
 outer defences. It used to be the     
 residence of the Lord. and later the  
 Governor, of the Isle of Wight.       
 Parts of the castle are ruined now,   
 but the keep and most of the curtain  
 wall are standing, and some of the    
 buildings inside it are still used.   
 One range of buildings houses a museum
 of Isle of Wight history; another is  
 divided into flats - one for the Head 
 Custodian, and one for the Head of the
 Maintenance Dept; and the chapel in   
 the courtyard is still used           
 occasionally for services. The castle 
 is in the care of English Heritage,   
 and it is one of the Island's main    
 tourist attractions.                  
 About 130,000 people visit it every   
 year.
