		<title>10Sports in Haltwhistle</title>
		<content>   Bowls have been played in           
 Haltwhistle for over 100 years. The   
 members take turns in looking after   
 the green and the club house.  Elderly
 players can often be seen sitting on  
 the benches in the sun watching.      
   Next door are two hard tennis courts
 with free access as the key has been  
 lost.  Players have to provide their  
 own racket and ball.                  
   In the summer there is an over 16   
 five-a-side football league which     
 meets on the school field.  This years
 winners were Lambo's Loonys.          
   The Haltwhistle fishing bailiffs    
 hold a fishing competition each year. 
 They take competitors by car to a spot
 by the river and after three hours    
 fishing the angler with the heaviest  
 fish wins.  First prize is a fishing  
 rod, second a reel and third a line.
