 pupils.

{(Aided) Junior and Infant School,     
 serves the parishes of Moreton        
 Morrell, Newbold Pacey and Ashorne.   
 However, children from the            
 neighbouring village of Lighthorne and
 a few children from Wellesbourne also 
 attend, especially if their parents   
 feel they would benefit from being at 
 a Church of England school. At the    
 time of the survey the school has 55  
 children on roll. Twenty eight are in 
 the junior department (8-11 yrs.) and 
 twenty seven infants (4-7 yrs.). There
