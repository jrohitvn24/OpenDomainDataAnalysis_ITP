		<title>13INTERESTING BUILDINGS</title>
		<content>   Most of the older part of{Ashton    
{Under Hill}is a conservation area.    
 There are seventeen listed buildings  
 including an 18th century Georgian    
 house and others of great merit and   
 interest. Outside the parish church,  
 with it's Norman South Door and       
 embattled tower,is a 14th century     
 stone cross with a three step base, a 
 shaft and sundial. Across the road is 
 an ancient cowshed with a line of rare
 connecting stone drinking troughs.    
 This building used to be in the       
 grounds of Middle Farm, itself a      
 listed building of rubble and tile,   
 but it was sold together with an      
 adjacent old barn.                    
   There are early black and white     
 thatched cottages with delightful     
 gardens, one of which used to be the  
 Old Plough public house. Another      
 listed building is the Manor House.   </content>
