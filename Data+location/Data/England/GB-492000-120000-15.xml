{1985} on  a  glorious  sunny  day  and

 the  band  of  Seaford College,  under
 their  conductor  Mr. Derek  Bester,  
 struck up,  and  played  at  intervals
 throughout the afernoon.While the band
 relaxed,  music was continued by three
 pipers  of  the  Pinstripe Highlanders
 from London.                          
   Teas were served  on the lawn and we

 side_shows and games, including pillow
 fights on a slippery pole  provided by
