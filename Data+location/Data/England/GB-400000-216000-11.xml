		<title>11The Mill becomes an Inn</title>
		<content>    The mill was fed by water from the 
 River Coln which was diverted into a  
 mill pond.This area of the hotel today
 is called the Waterwheel Bar,which is 
 totally modern.But part of the present
 building without doubt incorporates   
 parts of the original mill.Ale was the
 common drink in medieval England and  
 although the peasant brewed some in   
 his home from his own crop of barley, 
 the ale for communal feastings were   
 brewed at the mill which became the   
 village ale house. There,at the       
 Frogmill,were brewed the Easter and   
 the Whitsun ales,and other ales for   
 other feast days.For at least 1000    
 years ale has been drunk in the       
 Frogmill.It is probable that the      
 miller turned innkeeper early in the  
 eighteenth century when stage coaches 
 first operated on these roads.
