		<title>07POSTLIP MILL - Pt.1</title>
		<content> Postlip Mill was first recorded as    
 milling flour around 1066, using a    
 large water wheel.                    
 Paper has been manufactured at Postlip
 Mill since 1733 when John Durham began
 the Mills. By the late 18th C. three  
 mills were in operation at Upper -    
 Middle -and Lower Mill.               
 During the Second World War,P.M. made 
 blotting paper. After the War         
 typewriters and ball point pens became
 common and blotting paper was used    
 less and less until it went out of    
 production.                           
 Today P.M. make both ordinary as well 
 as filter paper. A large amount of    
 filter paper is used in a car's engine
 to filter oil and air. Filter paper is
 also used for coffee filter machines, 
 beer making, wines, spirits,paint,    
 varnish and the manufacture of the    
 drink Ribena.      (5)                </content>
