  There are 35 different machines on   
 the farm, including one combine       
 harvester.  The animals consist of 2  
 bulls, about 260 cattle including the 
 calves. There are 520 acres of land.  
 3 men work the farm. Half is put down 
 to grass, the other half, 160 acres,  
 to winter wheat, of which 196 tons    
 are produced.  600 tons of silage is  
 made.

  Wholesale fruit and vegetable        
 merchant.  Started in 1923 as market  
 garden, now 53 acres, 6 fields growing
 600 apple trees.  Fruit and vegetables
 are brought from all over the world   
 and sold to local shops.  The biggest 
 change to the business was the        
 introduction of pallets, because they 
 took away the work of many men.       </content>
