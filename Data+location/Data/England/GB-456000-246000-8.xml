		<content>{FOOTPATHS - A RAMBLERS VIEW}          
 Currently the map shows the area to   
 contain 2 miles of Bridleway &amp; 6.25   
 miles of Footpath, with the status of 
 recognised Rights of Way.  Little has 
 been done to preserve the unique &amp;    
 valuable benefits of this important   
 part of this country's heritage.      
 Cooperation with the landowners is    
 needed to help clear obstructions &amp;   
 replace footbridges &amp; stiles to enable
 more to appreciate the countryside.   
 The Highway Authority has a specific  
 duty to erect &amp; maintain a signpost at
 every point where a footpath, bridle- 
 way or byway leaves a metalled road.  
 There are 3 place where a Bridleway   
 sign might appear; in fact there is   
 only one.  There are 27 footpaths     
 joining metalled roads in the area;   
 only 2 are signposted.  There is 1    
 Green Lane &amp; 2 Byway signposts.       </content>
