		<content> Hibaldstow is situated in the flood   
 plain of the Vale of Ancholme 6km from
 the market town of Brigg and 12km from
 the industrial areas of Scunthorpe.The
 area is principally agricultural with 
 large fields spreading across the Vale
 to the Lincolnshire Wolds.The village 
 can be described as loosely nucleated.
 The original settlement has expanded  
 recently along the main routeways.This
 is an ancient area mentioned in the   
 original Domesday Book and contains   
 within its parish the deserted village
 of Gainsthorpe.Hibaldstow provides    
 employment but this is mostly to be   
 found in the nearby towns of Brigg and
 Scunthorpe.
