		<title>11MAKING SILAGE AT PONTESBURY</title>
		<content> The majority of farmers make silage in
 this area, instead of hay. They only  
 make a small amount of hay to feed    
 their calves.                         
 The silage is made in a clamp or pit, 
 either dug into the ground or with    
 purpose built sides. The grass is mown
 in May when the seeds are formed. It  
 is left in the swath to wilt for a    
 day, then it is chopped into short    
 lengths by a forage harvester, the    
 crop is then piled into the pit and   
 rolled by a tractor to remove as much 
 air as possible. This is then tightly 
 sealed and left to heat up and turn   
 into silage.                          
 The other method rapidly gaining      
 popularity is big bag silage. The     
 wilted grass is baled by a big baler  
 and the bale sealed into a polythene  
 bag. Each bale weighs about half a ton
 and is carried on a tractor spike.    </content>
