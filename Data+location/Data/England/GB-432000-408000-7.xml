		<content> In Barnsley we still use these very   
 old words:                            
{"Poppo"}is the Saxon word for horse.  
{"Gennel"}means a covered passage      
 between 2 houses. {"Snicket"}means a  
 cut between 2 houses. {"Laiken"}is a  
 Viking word for playing.{"Backend"}is 
 also a Viking word for Autumn.{"Thee"}
 means you. For example, "Shut up      
 thee." {"Tha"}means you. For example, 
 "Does tha want a feight?" ( fight ) or
 "Are tha laiken?" ( Are you playing   
 out? ) {"Spice"} is our name for      
 sweets. {"Bairn"} is a Viking word for
 child.{"Tig"} is another viking word  
 for a game. It means "touch". 5 out of
 the 27 children in our class do not   
 use these words even in the playground
 because their parents tell them not   
 to, either because they think it is   
 slang or they think it sounds stupid.
