		<title>04LIVING IN BURNESTON</title>
		<content> I live in Burneston, my house is just 
 outside Burneston and the name of the 
 house is called Albert House, and it  
 is about 200 years old. It is a farm  
 house and we have some, well quite a  
 lot of animals really. When I go to   
 school, at break we play on the buck, 
 we put the adjustible legs on the     
 top knotch, but we can't even get on  
 it, so we put it down to four holes   
 showing and we can jump it. When I go 
 home I get changed and I go riding. I 
 some times go to youth club on Friday,
 and we go swimming every month in     
 Northallerton.I like living in        
 Burneston.
