		<title>17The Railway Line.</title>
		<content>The railway that passes through our    
block is a section of line originally  
built in 1847 to link the north with   
the south of England by a shorter      
route. It was constructed by the Trent 
Valley Railway Company. The Company    
built the line between Stafford and    
Rugby. The London and North Western    
Railway Company took over the running  
of the line and in 1904 it was doubled 
in size to four tracks. The crossing in
Bishton Lane was then replaced by a    
bridge but the crossing keeper's       
cottage is still nearby. In 1924 the   
London Midland and Scottish Railway    
Company took over and in 1948 it became
part of the London Midland Region of   
British Railways. This line has seen   
the changes of locomotives from steam  
to diesel to electric traction         
including twice weekly runs by the     
Advanced Passenger Train.              </content>
