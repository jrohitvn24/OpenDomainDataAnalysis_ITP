		<title>03Bruce's Bakery,Great Ayton.</title>
		<content>{Bruces Bakery}is situated on Newton   
 Road.The bakery is a building built   
 of sandstone and it has 2 attractive  
 bow windows.The paintwork on the      
 bakery is white .Above the window     
 which faces the road there is a sign  
 which says,"A &amp; M Bruce Bakers And    
 Confectionary".Bruces bake their      
 bread,cakes and biscuits daily and Mr.
 Bruce thinks thats why his product    
 sells so well.The building that is now
 the bakery used to belong to          
 Thompsons,the hardware company,but Mr.
 Bruce bought the place off them about 
 20 years ago.Mr. Bruce has always been
 a baker  and he says thats what he    
 always wanted to be.When we visited   
 the bakery I noticed that the         
 machinery,sales counter,and the floors
 were very clean and the employees were
 very polite.If you ever visit Great   
 Ayton,call in at Bruces Bakery.       </content>
