		<title>19CUSTOMS IN GREAT WENHAM</title>
		<content>An area next to threeways is known by  
locals as 'Dodge City' and another area
next to Corner Farm on the Wenham Road 
is known as 'Silver City'.This is      
because Army accommodation huts were   
sited there during the 2nd World War to
house American Airmen serving at Raydon
Airfield.                              
The huts were taken over by the        
civilian population after the war until
they could be rehoused.Many were       
evacuees from London.These names of the
areas of Wenham are still present in   
the current doctor's notes.
