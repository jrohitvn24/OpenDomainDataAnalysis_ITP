		<title>13Langford School Organisation</title>
		<content>  The school has three classes.In Class
1. are the Infant Children aged 5 to 7.
In Class 2. are the Lower Juniors aged 
7 to 9. In Class 3. are the Upper      
Juniors aged 9 to 11. The teachers     
usually stay with the same age range   
and so the children have the same      
teacher for more than one year.        
  There are only a few children that   
live in Langford so most of them come  
to school by coach.Children coming from
Alvescot and Black Bourton go to the   
Alvescot Infant School before moving   
into Class 2. at the age of 7.There are
only about 4 or 5 that come from this  
school each year.                      
  Five local small schools, including  
Langford, have joined together to share
a mini-bus and to organise activities  
and trips for the children.
