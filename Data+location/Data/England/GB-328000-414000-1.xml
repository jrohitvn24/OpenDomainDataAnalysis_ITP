		<content>    About 85% of this area is sea,     
 sand and dunes.Of the rest,most is    
 taken up by the Royal Birkdale Golf   
 Club which hosted the Open Golf       
 Championships in 1983.The remaining is
 a residential area which contains the 
 southern limit of Victorian growth in 
 Southport and also some recent        
 development.All the houses are large  
 villas typical of the most prosperous 
 properties in Southport.The sand dunes
 are part of one of the most important 
 wildlife habitats in the British Isles
 protecting such species as the        
 Natterjack Toad while to bird watchers
 the beach and mudflats are part of one
 of the most interesting stretches of  
 coastline in the whole of Europe. The 
 beach is also used by Shrimpers at    
 work,many people at leisure and by    
 Ginger McCain to exerise his race     
 horses including the famous Red Rum.  </content>
