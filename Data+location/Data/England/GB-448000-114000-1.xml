		<content> This area is mainly farmland and like 
 the adjacent areas is mainly given    
 over to market gardening.The area is  
 famous for the production of          
 strawberries.There are very few       
 amenities to serve the sparse         
 population.In the past decade there   
 has been considerable housing         
 development in the adjacent area which
 has seen the growth of an Industrial  
 Estate in this area.The building of   
 the M27 and M3 has made the Industrial
 Estate very well situated for         
 distribution both along the south     
 coast and to London.There are some 37 
 sites on the Estate and there is      
 considerable expansion at present     
 which is taking the perimeter of the  
 Estate outside of this area.There is  
 an important Government Victualling   
 depot in the area.It is responsible   
 for provisioning the Armed Forces.    </content>
