		<content>  On Wednesdays the juniors have games.
 In the winter term the girls play     
 Netball and the boys Football.Fincham 
 boys come over and join with us.We    
 also do Cross Country Running on      
 Mondays.Mrs.Rochford,Mrs.Hipperson and
 Vivienne Swift take us to the Warren  
 where we jog or run about 2 miles.    
  In Science this year we have been    
 looking at our senses and we all had  
 various tests to do on each other. Dr.
 Garner gave us colour vision tests to 
 do.We have also looked at energy and  
 how we are using up the world's supply
 of fossil fuel.We tried making a      
 windmill and as it was a windy week   
 most of us managed to make one that   
 would work.We also use a BBC Computer 
 and have lessons from TV and radio.   
 Earlier this year there was a break-in
 -our computer equipment was stolen.The
 insurers gave us the money 6wks later.</content>
