		<content> Our area of Sutterton and its environs
 is of a Rural aspect with a           
 considerable farming element.It is    
 situated around the A16 to Spalding   
 and the A17 to King's Lynn.Therefore  
 the roads are very busy with heavy    
 goods transport going to the          
 ports.Originally the village was      
 linear the houses being along the two 
 main roads with the large estate in   
 the centre going through to Algarkirk 
 and belonging to the Beridge          
 family(there is still a family trust  
 to help children going on to further  
 education).This estate has now gone   
 but one of the two round gate houses  
 still stands leading to the Park      
 Avenue housing estate where the school
 stands.We were much surprised to find 
 there were 79 old people's bungalows  
 and only 37 semi-detached houses for  
 families.                             </content>
