		<title>09Social Problems in Shepshed</title>
		<content>   Life in{Shepshed}in 1985 is far from
 perfect. These are some of the things 
 that people are worried about.        
   The{vandalism}in Shepshed seems to  
 be getting worse. Bus stops, flower   
 beds, young trees, schools and other  
 public places suffer damage regularly.
{Dangerous driving}causes trouble.     
 Noise from motorbikes, speeding cars  
 and incovenient parking create        
 problems.{Graffiti}(writing on walls) 
 is spoiling Shepshed. Public          
 facilities are being defaced by youths
 who have nothing better to do.        
 Recently{glue-sniffing}has become a   
 serious problem. Young people inhale  
 the fumes from solvent-based glue,    
 which make them light headed and often
 violent. Shepshed often looks         
 disgusting because of the amount of   
{rubbish}thrown onto the ground,       
 in spite of the litter bins provided. </content>
