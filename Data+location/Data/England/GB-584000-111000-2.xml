		<title>02FAIRLIGHT AREA, EAST SUSSEX</title>
		<content> The eastern edge of Hastings,         
 Fairlight, Guestling and Pett, East   
 Sussex are rural areas.   There are   
 many farms here and many small natural
 woodlands.  The steep slopes, common  
 in this area, make some of the land   
 unsuitable for cultivation and this is
 usually left as natural woodland.     
                                       
 There are steep slopes either side of 
 several streams as they reach the     
 coast.   Away from the coast the      
 undulating landscape is both useful   
 for the farmer and attractive to the  
 tourist.                              
                                       
 The one main road through this area,  
 the A.259, takes a heavy traffic load 
 as it is the main coastal route to the
 cross-Channel ports of Folkstone and  
 Dover to the east, and Newhaven to    
 the west.                             </content>
