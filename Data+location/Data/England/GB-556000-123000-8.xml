		<content> MR EVERET IS RETIRED AFTER A LIFE IN  
 THE MERCHANT NAVY. HE AND HIS WIFE    
 LIVE AT UPPER OLD MILL FARM, AN       
 EXTENDED BUNGALOW SURROUNDED BY       
 WOODLAND AT THE END OF A TWO MILE     
 ROUGH TRACK. HE ENJOYS LOOKING AFTER  
 HIS GEESE AND LOOKING AFTER THE REMOTE
 PROPERTY WHICH IS NOT ACCESSIBLE TO   
 MAINS WATER OR DRAINAGE. HIS WATER    
 SUPPLY IS PUMPED FROM A CONTAMINATED  
 WELL AND MUST BE BOILED BEFORE BEING  
 CONSUMED. THE WATER IS STORED IN LARGE
 BARRELS, OPEN TO CATCH THE RAIN WATER.
 ANOTHER PROBLEM IS THE THREAT TO HIS  
 LIVESTOCK FROM FOXES. MR EVERET AND   
 HIS WIFE ENJOY DOCUMENTARY ITEMS BOTH 
 ON RADIO AND TELEVISION. MR EVERET    
 LIKES TO OBSERVE ALL FORM OF NATURAL  
 HISTORY. HE IS ANXIOUS ABOUT THE      
 FUTURE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE IN VIEW OF THE
 INCREASING PROBLEMS OF UNEMPLOYMENT   
 AND CRIME.                            </content>
