		<title>19The School Pond</title>
		<content>  The school pond at the beginning of  
 the Summer of 1985 was a mass of water
 lilies and very little else.          
  It was decided by the Biology        
 Department to clear it out and put 30 
 fresh water fish , a frog ,some new   
 water weeds in. This was done during  
 the last few weeks of term by a group 
 of fourth year boys.                  
  Altogether some 30 to 40 bags of     
 waste was removed from the pond.      
  It will be interesting to see how the
 pond has flourished in a few years    
 time.                                 
                                       
                                       
  A future development to the pond.    
                                       
 It is hoped to be able to build a     
 fountain in the next few years.
