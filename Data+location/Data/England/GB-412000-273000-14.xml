		<title>14CHESWICK GREEN</title>
		<content> Cheswick Green was built on a seventy 
 acre site by Greaves Limited as a     
 complete village with shops,a pub,a   
 village green,an assembly hall and a  
 primary school.                       
 Old manuscripts say that Cheswick     
 Green was once the site of an early   
 Saxon settlement.                     
 In 1904 the site was developed into a 
 'Pleasure Ground'with a refreshment   
 room and ballroom.Shrubs were planted 
 and a garden walk created along with a
 maze.                                 
 After the Second World War people     
 bombed out of their homes moved into  
 the holiday cottages and bungalows    
 that had been constructed on the site 
 between the wars.                     
 In 1968 Greaves Limited bought the    
 land for one million pounds.Today the 
 village is still growing with new     
 houses being built all the time.      </content>
