		<title>13HIGH TOP OBSERVATORY.</title>
		<content>  The South-West Herts Astrological    
 Society was formed in 1968 but has    
 only been on it's present location    
 since 1974.The society's observations 
 are mostly planetary.Sometimes they   
 watch meteors and sometimes they time 
 them.In their possesion are several   
 telescopes which can be adjusted to   
 different magnifications.The minimum  
 magnification is 228 times and the    
 maximum magnification is 460 times.One
 of the telescopes is specially housed 
 permanently.The housing has a         
 removable window which enables the    
 observer to observe the sky.The       
 telescope is made from an old         
 bedstead,tubing and a lamp post! There
 is another building which rotates on  
 wheels.This building acts as housing  
 for lots of other telescopes that are 
 not fixed in any one position         
 permanently.                          </content>
