		<title>11QUEEN MARY RESERVOIR</title>
		<content>  There are lots of reservoirs around  
  Staines.The{Queen Mary}has the       
 largest surface area of all of them.  
  It is filled from the Thames and then
 pumped out from a pumphouse beneath   
 the embankment.The pumps used to be   
 coal fired but are now electric.They  
 move about 80_90 million gallons of   
 water a day.This is nearly enough for 
 0.25 of London.                       
  The bank is 4 miles around and about 
 1 mile across.There is a big wall     
 called a "Baffle" about 0.75 of the   
 way across the reservoir to stop the  
 waves getting too big.                
  During the Second World War an       
 attempt was made to break the         
 banking.It was not successful but a   
 bomber with half a load of bombs      
 crashed into the water.It has been    
 located but will not be moved until   
 more gravel has been extracted.       </content>
