		<content> Fourteen children in our class of     
 twenty four were born locally.The     
 rest were born in America, London,    
 York, Cornwall and Scotland.          
{Old People}                           
 Mrs.Dunn is 86 years old and has      
 lived in North Newton for a long      
 time.She says she doesn't mind the    
 changes in the village over the       
 past 40 years,such as the new         
 bungalows being built.She remembers   
 a number of old customs in the        
 village including one where people    
 picked peas,putting them in their     
 hats.This was called Pea Fete Day.    
   As a child Mrs.Dunn had her school  
 holiday during the blackberrying      
 season so that she could go to pick   
 fruit to earn money.Mrs.Dunn is a very
 chirpy old lady.
