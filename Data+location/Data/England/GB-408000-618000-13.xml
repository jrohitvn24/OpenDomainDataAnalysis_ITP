		<title>13Safety and Dangers.</title>
		<content>  In our village there are 5 openings  
 onto the main road with poor views of 
 traffic. Vehicles coming down the hill
 often exceed the 30 mph limit (which  
 excludes 7 homes) causing danger to   
 cyclists and horse riders. The litter 
 bin is badly sited over the  road from
 the sweet shop. Large lorries have to 
 reverse out of Village Farm onto the  
 main road but cannot see behind them. 
 Children cannot be seen from tractors 
 if they stand too close and must not  
 try to drive them or ride on open     
 trailers. Machinery, especially in    
 motion,  plastic bags and climbing on 
 bales can all be dangerous.           
  There is an unfenced steep drop to   
 the burn behind the Village Hall and  
 unsupervised children walking along   
 Tarry could fall into the deep pool   
 behind dam. Many plants and berries   
 are poisonous and must not be eaten.  </content>
