		<content> The majority of the landuse is devoted
 to the production of {arable}crops.   
 Oilseed rape, winter sown wheat and   
 barley, potatoes and tic beans are all
 grown on the excellent {limestone}    
 soil.   {Yields}are high with rape    
 producing two tons to the acre and    
 wheat two and a half tons to the acre.
 During the month of May the area looks
 very colourful with the saffron       
 flowers of the rape being visible from
 a long way off.   Farming Units are   
 large and privately owned.   All use  
 the latest machinery.   Recently some{
{aerial}spraying of weedkiller on a    
 field of beans adjacent to our school 
 field overlapped and caused our       
 headmaster to complain to the Local   
 Authority.
