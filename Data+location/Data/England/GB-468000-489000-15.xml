		<title>15Village Life:Hutton-le-Hole</title>
		<content> Being a beautiful village, Hutton has 
 attracted middle-class people seeking 
 a peaceful retirement among tradition-
 al country people.Of approximately 180
 villagers, 50% are retired and 60% are
 'incomers'Relatively expensive housing
 and lack of public transport have     
 caused this imbalance.66% of families 
 own 1 car and 15%, 2 cars. 8 families 
 with school-age children, have moved  
 here during the last 4 years,mainly   
 professional people working out of the
 village.The villagers are friendly,and
 age is no barrier in social events eg.
 WI,and the loyally supported church.  
 Most people have flower and vegetable 
 gardens and some have hens and pets.  
 Nearly everyone enjoys and is inter-  
 ested in their surroundings. In summer
 the character of the village changes  
 externally,with the influx of tourists
 strolling around the 'green'.         </content>
