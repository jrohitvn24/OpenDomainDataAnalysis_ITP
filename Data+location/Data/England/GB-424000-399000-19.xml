		<title>19A DAY IN MY LIFE, CONTINUED</title>
		<content> When we went back to the classrom we  
 had a drawing lesson and finished our 
 day with a story. School finished at  
 3.30pm and we walked home. The weather
 has been good so we played out with my
 friends, if it had been raining I     
 would have watched T.V. or played on  
 our computer untill tea time. Tea time
 is usually when the family is together
 and we talk about our day. After tea  
 we played out then I did some reading 
 untill bed time at 8.30pm. I share a  
 bedroom with my brother so we had a   
 chat before we settled down to sleep. 
{SOME LOCAL PLACE NAMES}               
 Some local names come from the Cloth  
 Industry which once existed on Snowden
 Hill.We get Cloth Hall Farm, and      
 Tenter Hall Farm from this source.    
 Salter Hill Lane takes its name from  
 the Saltersgate to Rotherham Turnpike.
