		<title>15JACKSONS FARM</title>
		<content> Jacksons Farm was built in 1888 and   
 there are still bars in some of the   
 windows instead of glass.It is 85     
 acres and on this sheep are kept and  
 grass grown.In the winter the owners  
 buy sheep-cake which is made from     
 barley, wheat and beans.The modern    
 machinery has made farming much       
 quicker and easier.The EEC have       
 affected farming because farmers can  
 only grow a certain amount of food but
 they do get a fair price for it.The   
 landscape is flat, with a few hills on
 one side, but quite woody on the      
 other.There are wild flowers, trees,  
 and open fields.In 1888 there were a  
 lot more trees and less open          
 fields.Opposite Jacksons Farm are     
 kennels in which racing dogs are      
 kept.Nearby is a cravan site.The      
 land has not changed that much.
