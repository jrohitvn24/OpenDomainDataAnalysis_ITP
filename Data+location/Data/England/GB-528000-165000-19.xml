		<content>     Through our area there are three  
main "through London" routes;the London
Road, Mitcham Road and the Purley Way. 
The Purley Way serves the Industrial   
Area.  These roads carry vast numbers  
of lorries and vans carrying raw mater-
ials and finished goods from the South 
Coast to Croydon and the rest of the   
country.  The congestion is not helped 
by the number of parked cars, as few   
houses in our area have garages. Most  
local people use the bus service for   
getting to the main station and for    
shopping in Croydon centre. There are  
eight services running through  the    
area and an "all night" service was    
introduced a year ago. Many local      
people find the level of traffic       
(especially the articulated lorries)   
too high and find greatest difficulty  
in crossing even the smallest road, and
particularly the Lombard Roundabout.   </content>
