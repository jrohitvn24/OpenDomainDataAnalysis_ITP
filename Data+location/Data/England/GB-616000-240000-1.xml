		<title>01INTRO,SOUTH-EAST IPSWICH.</title>
		<content>This sector contains a great variety of
landscape and land-use,it is both urban
and rural,it has obvious links with    
it's estuary location and is an area   
under-going great change.              
  If one thing dominates, it is the    
estuary of the River Orwell, dissecting
the area from North to South. In the   
1980's more people have a chance to    
view this spectacular scenery with the 
construction of the Orwell Bridge.This 
architectural wonder gives views to the
North of Dockland industry and         
extensive housing,to the South of      
farmland,sheltered water for yachts and
peaceful woodland.                     
  Urban sprawl,old industry alongside  
modern industry,changes in river       
traffic and a radical change in the    
road network,all provide issues which  
make this area interesting and worthy  
of futher investigation.               </content>
