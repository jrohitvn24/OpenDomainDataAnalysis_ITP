		<content> I was going to be a bridesmaid. Mummy 
 and Daddy went to church while we put 
 our bridesmaids dresses on. After the 
 wedding, people took photographs of my
 sister and we went in the car to have 
 our dinner. Then we played and went   
 home and went to bed.

 I enroled at Brownies on Tuesday and  
 said "I promise that I'll do my best  
 to do my duty to God and the Queen and
 help other people and to keep the     
 Brownie guide law." Then I got my     
 Scottish kelpies badge and two more   
 badges.

 Lindsy and I went to the cinema. We   
 watched'101 Dalmatians' at Crawley.   
 Afterwards we went home on the train  
 and then watched television and went  
 to bed.
