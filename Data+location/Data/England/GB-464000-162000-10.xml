		<title>10Mortimer Farm Shop</title>
		<content> The shop made from an old cowshed has 
 a cobbled floor and wooden shelves. It
 sells vegetables and home-grown fruit 
 as well as produce from around the    
 village or from overseas, fetched from
 the market near London Airport. New   
 potatoes cost 10p/lb, tomatoes cost   
 48p/lb, strawberries cost 56p/lb,     
 peaches 15p each, carrots 20p/lb,     
 lettuces 20p each. Wholefoods like    
 cereals, nuts, dried fruit, spices and
 herbs sell very well and so do duck   
 eggs and Free Range eggs which cost   
 90p per dozen. Left over fruit and    
 vegetables are made into jam, chutney 
 or pickles by local people to sell in 
 the shop. Outside the shop they sell  
 plants, shrubs and herbs from their   
 gardens. The shop is open from 9-6 on 
 Thursday, Friday, Saturday in the     
 winter and daily from 9-7 in the      
 summer. This is a family business.    </content>
