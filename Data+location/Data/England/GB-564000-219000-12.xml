		<content>   Felsted School was founded in 1564  
 by the then Lord Chancellor of England
 (Richard, Lord Riche) and the original
 building is still in use as the Art   
 School and Book Shop.  Today there are
 about 450 boys and 56 fifth form girls
 at the school and all except about 30 
 boys are boarders and live there      
 during term time, paying over Â£5,000  
 per year for their education. There is
 also a Junior Preparatory School which
 takes about 150 boys aged eight to    
 thirteen years.                       
                                       
   Together the two schools employ over
 sixty teachers plus numerous domestic 
 and ancillary staff.  The school has  
 excellent facilities, many of which,  
 such as the swimming pool, drama and  
 music halls and book shop, are        
 available for use by the Local        
 community.                            </content>
