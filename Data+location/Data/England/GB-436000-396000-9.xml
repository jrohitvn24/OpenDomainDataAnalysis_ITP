		<title>09Wentworth, an Estate Village</title>
		<content>{Wentworth}is an{estate village.}All   
 the doors and window frames are       
 painted{green and cream}and these are 
 the{Wentworth family colours.}All the 
 people who live in the village are    
 tenants and{not}owners. There are very
 few new houses in Wentworth because   
 the Estate has{strict}rules about any 
 new building. People who live there   
 even had to ask{permission}if they    
 wanted to build a garage. The only new
 building that has been done are the   
{old peoples bungalows.}The{oldest     
{building}in the village is probably   
{Sue Hunts shop.}Along Main Street some
 of the cottages are lower than the    
 road this is because the road was     
 built after the cottages. In{1979}Earl
 Fitzwilliam transfered the village to 
 a{charitable trust}to keep it just as 
 it is. The villagers{dont}want        
 Wentworth to change at all.           </content>
