		<title>20HOW THIS PROJECT WAS MADE</title>
		<content> Classes one and two of{Great Oakley   
{Primary School}made this project in   
 the Summer of 1985.We visited         
{Dengewell Hall}and{Thompsons Farms.}We
 were told about the dairy herd at     
{Higher Barn Farm}and then walked back 
 to school through Gravel Wood.The     
 bluebells were out and looked         
 beautiful. The Rev.L. De Groose told  
 us all about the{Church.}Mr Betts came
 to talk about{Chartercoach},Lady      
 Hoskyns talked about{health}and Mrs   
 De Groose, Oakstones and W.I.In our   
 folders we have got writing, painting,
 maps and charts. One map is about bus 
 routes going through Great Oakley     
 another map is of Dengewell Hall Farm.
 My favourite piece of work is my      
 painting of the school.My folder is   
 covered by a pattern of pigs made by a
 3 coloured lino cut.                  
                                       </content>
