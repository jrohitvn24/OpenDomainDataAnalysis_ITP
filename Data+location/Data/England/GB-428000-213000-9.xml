        Most people we asked go to     
church occasionally.                   
                                       
31 out of 40 people owned a bible      
                                       
26 out of 40 people were christened    
                                       
17 out of 40 people believe in ghosts  
                                       
        The church congregation is     
small at present but is often quite    
large - it varies from year to         
year.Children play recorders and sing  
at Family Matins once a month.The      
school is church controlled and links  
are strong.A discussion group,Leafield 
Forum,meets once a month at the        
vicarage.                              
        The chapel meets every Sunday  
with a visiting minister.
