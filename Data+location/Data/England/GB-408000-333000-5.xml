		<title>05UTTOXETER STREET MARKET</title>
		<content>On Monday 15th May 1985, in Uttoxeter  
we asked stall holders questions.They  
bring their stalls to the market       
because there are vacancies and space  
for stalls, also stock sells well.     
Some said that they were not           
normally busy. Some would like better  
stalls, ground pavements. Having a     
market stall was a full time job for   
three quarters of the stall holders.   
They all said they took their stalls to
market elsewhere such as Blackwell,    
Sutton in Ashfield and Warwick. All the
stall holders we spoke to had been     
coming to the market for thirty to     
forty years. Wednesday is their        
favourite day. No stall had been passed
down from one generation to the next.  
We spoke to shoppers. They like        
Wednesday morning best,especially      
cheaper crockery,fruit, and veg.
