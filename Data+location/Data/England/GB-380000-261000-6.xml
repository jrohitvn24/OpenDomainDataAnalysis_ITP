		<content>{FOOTPATHS.}The area,especially east of
 the Severn, has many of these which   
 used to be living lines of            
 communication through pastoral        
 land.With changes in agriculture      
 fewer are now needed by the farming   
 community, so many are being re-routed
 to continue to give pleasure for      
 recreation without interfering with   
 farming practice.{WYCHAVON WAY }      
 This was devised by Wychavon Council  
 to commemorate the Silver Jubilee of  
 Queen Elizabeth II as a recreational  
 footpath to run eastwards to the      
 Cotswolds starting at Holt Bridge.    
 From there it follows the east bank of
 the Severn for one mile,then turns    
 east by a track leading to the pond at
 Turn Mill,which lies S.W. of Ombersley
 Court.By Holt Bridge a large elm tree 
 has survived Dutch Elm Disease.
