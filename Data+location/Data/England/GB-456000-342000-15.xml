		<title>15CHANGING TIMES IN MAPPERLEY</title>
		<content> This area has changed.In 1945 Penarth 
 Gardens was Nottingham Brickyard.Now  
 it is housing.Woodthorpe Park used to 
 have a railway running through it.    
 School today is different than in 1945
 but the games we play are similar.We  
 still have Rounders and swimming but  
 we have computers,the most modern     
 thing today.In 1945 black and white   
 televisions were coming out.Today we  
 take colour televisions for granted.  
 The most modern clothes today are     
 light colouredtrousers,baggy jeans    
 elasticated at the ankle,which are    
 different from 1945.Modern things then
 were midi lengths and flares.Family   
 life today is much easier than 1945.  
 When we have spare time we can play,  
 but in 1945 they had to help in the   
 home,scrubbing doorsteps and Monday   
 was washday.But family life was very  
 close.   R.Neill,B.Kaur,V.Williams.   </content>
