		<content> The M56, one of the major access roads
 into North Wales runs through our     
 area. It is a mojor factor in         
 attracting companies into the new     
 towns. There is a junction with the M6
 6 miles away to the east. If you      
 follow the M6 south you will evetually
 come to Birmingham. If you go north   
 you will come to Carlisle and         
 Scotland. If you travel East on the   
 M56 you can join up with the M63      
 and M62, joining Lancashire to        
 Yorkshire. This junction also gives   
 easy entry to Manchester.
