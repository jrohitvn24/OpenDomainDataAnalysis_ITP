		<title>01Flooding On Shoreham Beach</title>
		<content>    In late November, 1984 torrential  
 rain, storm force winds and high tides
 combined to produce the worst flooding
 in living memory on Shoreham Beach.   
 Over one weekend 34 homes and an      
 entire factory were flooded and beach 
 huts were torn apart as the storm     
 carried on and off for 24 hours.The   
 road was completely swamped near the  
 church of the Good Shepherd which was 
 well sand bagged.The Saltings were so 
 badly flooded that it had to be closed
 to the public.Gardens were turned into
 lakes.                                
    Maybe in the future there will be a
 real danger to housing on Shoreham    
 Beach and lives may be lost.          
    Between 1980 and 1985 floods became
 more regular and the sea has come     
 across the sea defences.Nothing much  
 has been done as yet and the situation
 seems to get worse each year.         </content>
