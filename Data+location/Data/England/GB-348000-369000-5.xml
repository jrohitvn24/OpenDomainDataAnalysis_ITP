		<content> Before Ashton's community centre was  
 opened people used the Parish Rooms,  
 the W.I.hall ,the Primary school and  
 the scout hut for meetings. When the  
 old school could no longer be used by 
 the children of Ashton Hayes, because 
 of a faulty roof,the Parish Church    
 sold the lease on the old school to   
 the villagers of Ashton to make it    
 into a community centre.The Man Power 
 Service Commision made the old school 
 into the centre.It took 4 years to    
 carry out the main alterations and    
 cost Â£25,000.It is going to be opened 
 on the 13th of July 1985. A lot of    
 people paid for the work including the
 parish council and the people of      
 Ashton .The centre will be used for   
 lots of actvities such as A.C.F.,     
 badminton, drama and social events .  
 The doctor will also use it a surgery.
