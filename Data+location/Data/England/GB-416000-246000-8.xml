		<content>   Quinton's position about six miles  
 South of{Stratford upon Avon}renders  
 it somewhat subject to the summer     
 influx, especially, of{visitors}to the
 historic{national treasures.}There is 
 all the local association with the    
 famous bard,{William Shakespeare.     
   Some local inhabitants are able to  
 offer tourists facilities for{caravan,
{camp sites and accommodation. }There  
 are some well- known local{hostelries 
 with period charm.There are several   
 valuable{historic listed buildings    
 locally, and the{National Trust}holds 
 many properties within easy reach of  
 the area.                             
   Not only is the area rich as a      
{national resource,}but tourists       
 travelling from the North East to the 
 South West and Wales pass through the 
 area and are able to enjoy a          
 delightful part of England.           </content>
