		<content>   The meadows around the Coombe Hill  
 Canal are flooded on average for two  
 months each year. During the winter   
 counts of 3,000 Wigeon, 1,000 Mallard 
 and several hundred Shovellers,       
 Pintails, and a few Gadwall, Teal and 
 Bewick Swan are made; these birds     
 migrating from the Arctic.            
 In the summer the area is a breeding  
 ground for Curlews, Redshanks,        
 Lapwings and Snipe. The hedgerows are 
 mainly Hawthorn which provides food   
 for winter Redwing and Fieldfare and  
 summer nesting for Willow Warbler,    
 Whitethroat,Thrushes and Green        
 Woodpecker. Along the Coombe Hill     
 Canal is the habitat of the Yellow    
 Wagtail. Some Kestrel which feed on   
 voles and beetles are to be seen but  
 a lot have moved nearer to the        
 M.5.Motorway.
