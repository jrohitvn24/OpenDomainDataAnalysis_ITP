		<content>{Lee's Weekend                         
 I wake up at 8am and have some        
 Grapefruit juice and some cornflakes  
  with  coffee.I put the television    
 on and watch W.A.C. the Wide awake    
 club.I go to football for cubs until  
 12.00 o'clock.After dinner I play at  
 the Villge Hall for an hour then I go 
 home to get an  ice cream then watch  
 the football on television.           
{James' Weekend.        '              
  I get up at about 10 o' clock and    
 have some breakfast, a boiled egg,    
 frosties and some toast. Then I get   
 washed  and dressed then I probably go
 out somewhere or perhaps watch some   
 TV.                                   
  Later I will have my lunch and I may 
 play a game of snooker with my dad. I 
 may listen to some Breakdance music or
 some electro music,then I watch       
 more TV then I   go to bed.           </content>
