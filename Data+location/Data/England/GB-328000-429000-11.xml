		<content> Trains on the Blackpool South Line    
 stop at Squires Gate Station,five     
 minutes walk from the airports        
 entrance.                             
          Buses from Lytham St.Annes   
 and Blackpool pass the airport        
 entrance,and the number 12 bus route  
 terminates within the airport.Coaches 
 from all parts drop and pick up       
 passengers at the coachair station.   
 Blackpool is,of course,unique in its  
 tramway system running along the sea  
 front.                                
       When an aircraft is coming in   
 for landing the pilot makes a radio   
 contact with the approach controller  
 who is in the control tower.He gives  
 him current direction and strength of 
 surface wind.After the aircraft has   
 landed,it is important that it should 
 leave the runway as quickly as        
 possible.                             </content>
