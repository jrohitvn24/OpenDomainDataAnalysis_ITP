		<content> THE VILLAGE OF WEST FELTON IS SITUATED
 IN THE CENTRE OF THE BLOCK,SURROUNDED 
 BY ITS SATELLITE HAMLETS OF QUEENS    
 HEAD,SUTTON,GRIMPO,TWYFORD,WEIRBROOK  
 AND WOOLSTON.A DISUSED SECTION OF THE 
 SHROPSHIRE UNION CANAL CUTS ACROSS ONE
 CORNER OF THE BLOCK,WITH THE REMAINS  
 OF THE OLD ASTON LOCKS STILL VISIBLE  
 AND A TURNING BASIN AT QUEENS HEAD.IT 
 IS HOPED TO RE-OPEN IT IN THE NEAR    
 FUTURE.THE VILLAGE IS SPLIT IN TWO BY 
 THE A5 LONDON TO HOLYHEAD TRUNK ROAD  
   BUT A BY-PASS IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION 
 AND DUE TO BE COMPLETED IN 1987.THIS  
 WILL NOT ONLY CHANGE THE CHARACTER OF 
 THE VILLAGE PHYSICALLY BUT ALSO       
 SOCIALLY,AS THE PRESENT HEAVY VOLUME  
 OF TRAFFIC TENDS TO KEEP              
 PEOPLE,PARTICULARLY THE ELDERLY AND   
 THE YOUNG, TO THEIR OWN SIDE OF THE   
 VILLAGE.
