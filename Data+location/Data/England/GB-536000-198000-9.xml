		<title>09WALTHAM ABBEY TOWN HALL</title>
		<content> A group of children from class 4R,    
 went to the Town Hall on 27th June    
 1985. They found out a lot about its  
 history and its function today.       
                                       
 The town hall was built in{1906,}so it
 is{79 years old.}It has over 20 rooms.
                                       
 Within the Town Hall is a{computer    
 room where the local{lottery}is drawn 
 each week (at random). This room also 
 has the charts for the local cemetery 
 and garden of rest. There are also    
 store rooms  where the paper and      
 Christmas decorations are kept.       
 A few years ago there was a{fire}in   
 the town hall,which started where the 
 decorations are kept.Luckily the      
 building wasn't badly damaged.        
 Some people who work in the building  
 believe its{haunted!
