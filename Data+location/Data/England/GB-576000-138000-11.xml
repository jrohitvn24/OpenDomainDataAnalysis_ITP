  Education is quite good with a       
secondary and grammar school,Angley and
Cranbrook,that serve this area.Mr      
Taylor has a child at each.There is    
also several primary schools that serve
it.                                    
                                       
  Employment is a problem everywhere   
although Mr Taylor and his family are  
not directly affected.Farming is the   
major land use and therefore provides a
good proportion of the employment.Most 
of which are in hop gardens and        
orchards which is only seasonal.Oasters
egg production farms is the only       
industry and provides several jobs.The 
area's landscape is rapidly changing   
with hop gardens and orchards being    
grubbed out an planted with grain      
crops.                                 </content>
