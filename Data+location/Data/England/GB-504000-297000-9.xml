		<title>09WANSFORD PARISH COUNCIL</title>
		<content>  The Parish Council is a vital aspect 
 of village life, a group who keep the 
 village running smoothly.  The size of
 the group depends on the amount of    
 people in the village.  There is      
 always a Chairperson, Clerk and       
 Treasurer, as well as the councillors 
 themselves.  In Wansford the council  
 meets normally in the Village Hall.   
 If this is not available they will    
 meet in the church or parish room.    
  The Parish Council is responsible for
 seeing to local problems.  It needs to
 keep footpaths, bus- shelters and     
 other public amenities maintained for 
 the villagers to use.  The Parish     
 Council is an organisation to keep    
 the village in order and to ensure its
 well being.
