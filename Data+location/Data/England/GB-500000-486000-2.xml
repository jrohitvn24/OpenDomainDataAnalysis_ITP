 cattle but he also has other animals. 
 145 ewes,230 lambs,4 rams,6 hens and 1
 cockerel. There are 94 cows,61 heifers
 and 7 calves. Each cow yields 5300 lts
 per year for which the farmer gets 15p
 per litre giving about Â£800 per cow   
 per year.In Winter cows sleep in small
 cubicles and feed on silage and dairy 
 nuts.In Summer they are outdoors and  
 eat grass.                            
 Cows diseases are mastitus,clots in   
 the milk and lameness.The farm has    
 been established for 16 years.Milk is 
 sent to Northern Dairies in Hull.The  
 Common Market limits the amount of    
 milk produced on each farm. Milking in
 the herringbone parlour takes two and 
 a half hours. Mr Tyson auctions his   
 cows at Seamer Market every Monday.   </content>
