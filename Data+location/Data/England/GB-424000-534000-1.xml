		<content>  {The township of Spennymoor and the  
{villages of Tudhoe and Croxdale       
{present and interesting and varied    
{face to the world which we will try to
{portray here.                         
   In order to provide a view of life  
 in the Spennymoor area we have begun  
 with a general description of the area
 (pages 2 to 7). There then follows a 2
 page report on a survey given to 11   
 and 15 year old children (pages 8 and 
 9). A description of a local farm is  
 given on pages 10 and 11. An          
 interview with an elderly resident who
 knows the area well is reported next  
 (pages 12 and 13). On pages 14 and 15 
 is found a school-girl's diary. This  
 is followed by a child's view of the  
 future (page 16). Pages 17 to 19      
 comprise a visitor's guide to the     
 area. On page 20 is a little story of 
 how the Nicky-Nack got its name.      </content>
