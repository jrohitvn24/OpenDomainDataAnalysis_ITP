		<title>01North Central Coventry</title>
		<content> The North Central area of Coventry    
 reflects the local history of the     
 City.The decline of the motor industry
 which once attracted migrants  and    
 overseas  immigrants in search of     
 employment has led to  unemployment   
 and population decline.  The          
 homogeneity created by migration      
 remains and the area contains many    
 differing life-styles and cultures,   
 especially in the centre.  It is also 
 an area of building and architectural 
 contrasts, ranging from shopping      
 precincts, ring roads, high rise      
 flats, 19th and 20th Century inner    
 city and surburban housing, a medieval
 Guildhall and Cathedral, a modern     
 Cathedral, Churches, Chapels, Mosques,
 Temples and a Synagogue.  Remnants of 
 the motor industry remain in smaller  
 premises.The city centre was destroyed
 by bombing in World War II.           </content>
