  They have 7 rooms in the cottage.    
  They own 3.7 acres which originally  
 belonged to ConeyGreen Farm.          
  They are a certified caravan site,but
 they are only allowed to have up to 5 
 caravans on the site at one time.     
  They think that there was a          
 brickmaker in the area because        
 Brickyard Cottages are nearby.
