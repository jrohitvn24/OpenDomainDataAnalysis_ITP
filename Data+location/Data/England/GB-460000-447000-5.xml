		<content>   After  waking I washed,dressed then 
 went downstairs.I ate my breakfast    
 whilst watching television.After I    
 went upstairs and brushed my hair and 
 cleaned my teeth before Dad took me to
 school by car.At school we did        
 Mathamatics until playtime followed by
 English until dinner.I stopped for    
 packed lunch,then played on the school
 field until the start of afternoon    
 lessons.We then studied the history of
 tea and continued with this topic     
 all afternoon.After school I walked   
 home in time to watch'Children's Hour'
 on the television.Later I practised on
 the piano and cello.After tea I went  
 to York University to play cricket    
 with my family.On our return I changed
 into my night clothes,then ate my     
 supper whilst watching television.    
 After supper I went upstairs,washed   
 and cleaned my teeth.Then went to bed.</content>
