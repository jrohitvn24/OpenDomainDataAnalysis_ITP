 550 A.D. as a good defensive position 
 and convenient crossing place on the  
 River Wylye. It was proclaimed capital
 of Wessex in 838 by King Egbert from  
 the Royal Palace in Kingsbury Square, 
 Wilton. An important Abbey had been   
 established by 830. Town &amp; abbey were 
 attacked &amp; burnt by Danes several     
 times.Important as a mint.Granted 1st

 England.Mentioned in Domesday Book &amp;
