		<title>01Rural Life To_day</title>
		<content> Rural life is in the 1980's very      
 transient as people move around a     
 great deal possibly as a result of    
 their occupations.Farming methods     
 having changed very rapidly in the    
 last 25 years, labour intensified     
 and limited.People generally have     
 their own transport, averaging  two   
 cars per family, both parents going   
 out to work possibly commuting to     
 London or more locally to cities      
 such as Winchester or Salisbury.      
 Children travel in coaches to school  
 as much as 15_20 miles to the         
 secondary education schools.Many      
 houses are second homes  to the       
 affluent of soceity,who travel down   
 at week_ends to enjoy the peace of the
 countryside and their gardens.Alas    
 they contribute nothing to village    
 life.It can be arguedthat they have   
 rescued derelict farm cottages.       </content>
