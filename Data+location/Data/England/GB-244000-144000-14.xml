		<content>     There are a number of shops in    
 Woolacombe, catering both for the     
 summer visitors and for the locals    
 throughout the year.  Shops open all  
 year round include 2 Grocery shops,   
 Post Office, Dairy, Newsagents,       
 Butchers, Laundrette and Garage.      
     Other shops open on a part-time   
 basis over the winter include the     
 Chemists, a craft shop, an off-       
 licence, a sweetshop, a green-        
 grocers and a fish and chip shop.     
     During the summer, however, a     
 large number of other shops open for  
 the tourists - cafes, gifts, clothing 
 shops, beach goods, newspapers, etc.  
     One centre for the tourists is the
 Red Barn, a cafe near the beach where 
 holidaymakers can sit outside in the  
 sun enjoying the scene and the stalls 
 nearby.
