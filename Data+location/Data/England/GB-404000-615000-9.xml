 The pottery is situated in an old farm
 building which was originally used    
 for working horses.The building is    
 constructed of a mixture of river     
 stone and locally quarried stone.     
                                       
 The pottery is open from 9.30 a.m. to 
 6 p.m.-but closed on Sundays. The     
 busiest time is during the Summer     
 holidays. The pottery was started by  
 Alastair Hardy who works alone with   
 the occasional student.               </content>
