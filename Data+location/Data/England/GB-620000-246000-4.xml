		<content> Average annual rainfall:- 26.41       
 inches.  Aerage maximum daytime       
 temperature: January 44 F, July 74 F. 
 Winters cold but less snow than in    
 other parts of England.  The          
 enlargement of fields by removing     
 hedges has diverted footpaths round   
 edges of fields but many paths remain 
 unaltered.  Most common pollution     
 comes now from staw-burning, since the
 National Farmer's Union issued its    
 guidelines this problem as decreased  
 but not disappeared.  22/46, 23/46:40 
 acres of opened quarry filled in with 
 1 million tonnes household/trade      
 refuse; methane gas caused pollution  
 but now controlled by pipework and a  
 flarestack.  Small mammals to fox     
 size, toads, frogs, wading birds in   
 winter, sand martins in summer.  Rare 
 birds - Kingfisher, barn owl.  A      
 meadow containing marsh orchids.      </content>
