		<content>   The{Strethall}parish is the smallest
 in the country.The church's arch is   
 one of the oldest in the country.     
   The{farmhouse}near the church was   
 once a{manor house}.The quakers set up
 a village library in the manor house. 
   The church isn't in the same place  
 as the village because of the plague. 
   Long ago 3{gypsies}got information  
 that the farmer was mistreating his   
 wife.So they went to do something     
 about it.but the farmer got word of   
 this and was waiting at the top of the
 stairs in his house with a shotgun.   
 When the gypsies broke in he shot the 
 first,killing him immediately.The     
 second was badly wounded.But the third
 got away without injury.The body of   
 the dead man was hung in the church   
 tower and people paid a penny to see  
 him.
