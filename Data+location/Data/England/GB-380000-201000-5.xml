		<content> There are few leisure facilities in   
 the village;cricket and football are  
 played on the Recreation Ground.There 
 is one pub in the village with a      
 Skittle Alley.The village has a       
 video-tape library.Several groups use 
 the Village Hall for leisure pastimes 
 and private functions are held there  
 regularly.For the children, swings and
 a slide are provided on the Recreation
 Ground.Many people spend their time   
 gardening and walking in this         
 beautiful part of Gloucestershire.    
 HANG-GLIDERS can often be seen when   
 the wind is in the right direction.   
 The people who fly on the hang-gliders
 meet on the edge of Selsley Common    
 above the village and come from many  
 miles around because the air-currents 
 are right for the sport.A hang-glider 
 is a large sail on a light-weight     
 frame which  supports one person.     </content>
