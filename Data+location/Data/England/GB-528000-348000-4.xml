 life well. She has lived in her house 
 for 50 years. She remembers World War 
 1 and 11 well. There were many        
 Zeppelins and they made a big noise.  
       Life was very hard in those     
 early days of her life. She worked as 
 a servant in a grand house called     
 Frithville Stud her transport in those
 days was by bicycle or she walkedto   
 work. She used to go to Boston her    
 nearest town by carriers cart.        
       She met her husband to-be at    
 school.Her main event of the year was 
 a day out to Skegness which cost her a
 shilling or 5p.Each week she used to  
 go to Sunday School.
