		<title>01Introduction to Mayfield</title>
		<content> Mayfield is a Wealden Village of about
 3,500 inhabitants,9 miles south of    
 Tunbridge Wells,21 miles north of     
 Eastbourne,&amp; 42 miles from London.The 
 main A 267 Eastbourne_Tunbridge Wells 
 road runs through the centre of       
 Mayfield.                             
 Mayfield in 1985 is a "Dormitory      
 Village,"with no real large employer  
 meaning that people commute to work in
 the surrounding towns &amp; London each   
 day.The local farms do provide some   
 employment however.                   
 Many buildings in Mayfield are very   
 old,from 15th_18th centuries,and there
 are only a very few new ones.Some of  
 the houses are very large,there are a 
 lot of bungalows but few flats.       
 Public transport is poor;most families
 have a car.                           
 Mayfield has a lot of old people who  
 have retired here.                    </content>
