		<title>19A Typical Week-end</title>
		<content> The way I usually spend a weekend is  
 like this :-                          
             I wake up on Saturday     
 morning at about half past nine,get   
 dressed and have some breakfast. Then 
 I put on my coat and walk over to my  
 friend's house and together we go to  
 the bus stop to catch the bus to      
 Worcester.  The journey takes about   
 twenty minutes to get to Newport      
 Street.We then walk through to the    
 town and look into the shops.Sometimes
 we buy an article but usually we      
 haven't got enough money.At 12'0'clock
 we buy some sandwiches, a bar of      
 chocolate and a can of drink. We      
 always have our dinner in Woolworths  
 because that is the cheapest place to 
 get a meal.When we've finished we     
 carry on looking round the shops,at   
 1.45 pm we buy an ice lolly and walk  
 down to the riverside to eat them.    </content>
