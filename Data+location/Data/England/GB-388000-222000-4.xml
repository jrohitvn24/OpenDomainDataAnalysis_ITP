		<content>{ROADS.}The M5 runs near our school and
 all day and every day it is very busy 
 with cars and lorries moving North and
 South. We did intend to camp out one  
 night and make a long census of the   
 traffic but the weather was so bad    
 that we had to cancel the idea. On our
 journeys around we made quick counts  
 of traffic and at one time there was a
 vehicle every second. We also had an A
 road from Cheltenham to Tewkesbury and
 Gloucester but these were not as busy 
 as the motorway except at peak times  
 with people travelling to and from    
 work. In between these major roads    
 there were many B and C roads. These  
 were very quiet except for peak       
 periods. There was a coach depot and a
 sewage farm in the area and their     
 traffic was too big really for the    
 small roads. Some farmers' delivery   
 lorries also were too heavy.          </content>
