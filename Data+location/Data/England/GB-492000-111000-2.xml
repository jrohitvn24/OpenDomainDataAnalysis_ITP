		<content> About one third of this downland      
 estate is in the designated area.  The
 estate is about 800 acres of rolling  
 downland providimg grazing for 1000   
 sheep of Dorset Horn 3/4 cross Mule.  
 The areas not grazed by sheep are used
 for wheat and barley, hay, bag silage 
 and turnips for the sheep. In the     
 designated area there are three flint 
 cottages:- "Mallowes" whre the farm   
 manager and his wife live, and a pair 
 of cottages known as "Droke Cottages" 
 where two farm workers live.  All of  
 these people keep chickens, which are 
 at present in danger from the foxes   
 even in daylight.
