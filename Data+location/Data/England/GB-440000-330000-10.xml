		<content>   The area is mainly used for         
 agricultural purposes. There are at   
 least 12 farms, ranging from small    
 dairy to large arables.               
   Our farming surveys showed that the 
 farmers enjoyed their work because    
 they could spend time in the open air 
 and because they liked to be there own
 boss. They most disliked the          
 uncertainty of the weather. It did not
 always do what the farmers wanted it  
 to do. Harvesting is the busiest      
 time of the year.                     
   We found out about three farms from 
 the children who live on or near the  
 farm or whose parents work on the     
 farm.                                 
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
