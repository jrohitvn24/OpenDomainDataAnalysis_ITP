		<title>01     Welcome to Cowes</title>
		<content>    For most visitors it is East and   
 West Cowes that is their first glimpse
 of the Isle of Wight. For many it is  
 only a fleeting glimpse as they head  
 for the beaches of the South Wight.   
                                       
    The settlement at Whippingham, East
 Cowes, was mentioned in the original  
 Domesday, but generally our area has  
 played a minor role in English        
 history.                              
                                       
    We are Osborne Middle School and   
 are situated in East Cowes.  We look  
 onto the more popular town of Cowes.  
 The area came to prominence when two  
 forts were built on either side of the
 entrance to the River Medina, during  
 Henry V111's reign, in 1540.  It is   
 said that at this time the word{COWE} 
 meant{fort. }Hence East Cowes and West
 Cowes.                                </content>
