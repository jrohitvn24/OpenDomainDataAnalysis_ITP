		<title>06TRANSPORT NEAR SEISDON</title>
		<content>   Transport, or rather, the lack of   
it, presents a major problem in this   
district.   A regular bus route runs   
several times a day along the A454     
between Wolverhampton and Bridgnorth   
and another, very restricted  service  
meanders from Claverley to             
Wolverhampton, through the villages,   
only touching this area at Seisdon.    
Limited as these services are they are 
at present under threat because of     
current legislation de-regularising bus
services and local people fear even    
greater isolation.                     
   People who do not live within       
walking distance of one of these bus   
routes are dependant on private cars   
for all their transport needs,         
including travelling to work,          
shopping,visiting the Doctor's surgery 
and social life.
