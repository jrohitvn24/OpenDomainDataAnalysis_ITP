In a survey of the occupations of      
children's parents in our area, the men
were employed in manual and unskilled  
work.  None of them was a trained      
professional.  Some were involved in   
the transport industries such as       
Leyland Motors and British Aerospace.  
A few provided services such as        
painting and decorating and carpet     
fitting.  The remainder who had managed
to secure work were employed locally in
the few available jobs in the area.    
                                       
The mothers who worked were found to be
mainly in part-time occupations such as
shop assistants, cleaners and general  
helpers in schools and social services 
establishments.  None of the mothers   
had trained for a profession.
