		<title>20A Last Look at Harpenden</title>
		<content> Three schools from Harpenden, The     
 Grove, Wood End and The Lea have been 
 working together to produce this      
 Domesday Project about Harpenden.   We
 have looked at, learned and written   
 about many of the interesting parts of
 our town. However, we feel many other 
 things should have been mentioned for 
 example:  the consumer survey test    
 centre for the 'Which' magazine;  the 
 research done into pesticides at the  
 laboratory of the Ministry of         
 Agriculture, Fisheries and Food; the  
 old manor house at Rothamsted, the    
 Public Hall which is the meeting place
 for so many groups and societies; The 
 Common and the concern of so many folk
 to preserve the village atmosphere    
 in a growing community. Harpenden is a
 green and pleasant place to live and  
 we hope you have enjoyed finding out  
 about it in our work.                 </content>
