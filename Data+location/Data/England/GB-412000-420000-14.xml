		<title>14BRICK MAKING</title>
		<content>    Bricks  are made of shale, fire-   
 clay, dye and water.When the shale is 
 dug up it is put into a machine which 
 gets rid of the unwanted things like  
 sulphur etc. The shale is put onto a  
 pile outside for a month to weather.  
 Then it goes into a big pan and two   
 rollers, ten tons in weight, rotate   
 and crush the shale. Next, water and  
 fireclay are added. This goes into a  
 vacuum chamber where all the air is   
 sucked out and it comes out in a never
 ending cuboid length. Another machine 
 perforates the cuboid and cuts it into
 brick size. The bricks go in a drier  
 to harden. There they are spaced out  
 and put on kiln cars where they move  
 slowly through a kiln where they reach
 1060 degrees C at their hottest. Then 
 they are cooled, taken out and stacked
 ready for sale.
