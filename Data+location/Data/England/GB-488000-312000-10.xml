		<title>10Cottesmores' Old Houses</title>
		<content> Our group went with Mr.Williams down  
 to Cottesmore Village, on Tuesday 2nd 
 July to sketch some very old houses,  
 Mr. Williams told us that to draw,    
 first you need to have the typical    
 idea of the old houses, after that you
 draw it very gently then press a bit  
 harder to make it show better.After   
 doing that you can do all the         
 details for example look at this:     
 bricks, very old cracks on the walls, 
 a lot of moss on the roof and         
 shadings.Mr. Williams drew a very old 
 cottage with a lovely thatched roof.  
 Only one of us did the top 0f the     
 village church  (Peter). Simone       
 drew a very old cottage with a tiled  
 roof coverd with moss, this is one of 
 the cottages that have a gable in the 
 roof.The tiles came from Collyweston.
