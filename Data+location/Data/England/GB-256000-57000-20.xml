		<title>20Sparkwell Guides.</title>
		<content>   Guides are girls from the ages of 11
 to 15. We meet on Mondays at 7 o'clock
 in Sparkwell Primary School. Guides   
 were started in 1910 by Lord and Lady 
 Baden-Powell. We wear blue skirts with
 blue shirts and we also wear red ties 
 with leather woggles and hats. We are 
 called the 1st Sparkwell Guides.      
   We can try to win badges to sew on  
 our sleeves. Some of the badges you   
 can win are for collecting things like
 stamps. For the 'Friend to animals'   
 badge you have to keep a record of    
 what you have done to look after your 
 pet. On some Monday nights in the     
 summer we go tracking in the woods or 
 cooking up on the moors.              
   This year - 1985 - the Guides       
 are celebrating their 75th Anniversary
 with all sorts of challenges, camps   
 and campfires.      Lisa Wilton, Sarah
 Masey, Claire Verran and Denise Bevan.</content>
