		<title>03THE CUT OFF CHANNEL</title>
		<content>   A striking feature of the landscape 
 of the Eastern Fens is the Cut off    
 Channel. This embanked artificial     
 river was constructed in the 1950s to 
 lessen the risk of floods such as     
 those which flooded the Fens during   
 l912, l947 and 1953.                  
   The purpose of the channel is to    
 divert the headwaters of the rivers   
 Lark, Little Ouse and Wissey direct to
 the Great Ouse at Denver Sluice,      
 rather than allowing them to overflow 
 their banks in passing through those  
 parts of the Fens which lie below sea 
 level.                                
   The channel can also be used to take
 water in the opposite direction to    
 supply the domestic needs of Essex.
