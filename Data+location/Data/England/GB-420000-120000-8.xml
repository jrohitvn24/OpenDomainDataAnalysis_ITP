		<title>08Newhouse, Redlynch 1</title>
		<content> Newhouse was built just before 1619 to
 a Y-shaped design.The Eyres bought    
 Newhouse in 1633 and added two wings  
 in the 18th century.Later Victorian   
 additions were demolished in 1972,    
 riddled with dry rot.                 
     The Eyres were united with the    
 Matchams in 1817 and their descendants
 still own Newhouse.The house has      
 connections with Admiral Lord Nelson, 
 his sister being Catherine Matcham.   
 Horatia, daughter of Nelson and Lady  
 Hamilton spent much of her childhood  
 at Newhouse.                          
     The house contains several Nelson 
 mementoes including articles of       
 clothing, a lock of hair, his chair   
 from HMS Victory and two rare         
 paintings on glass depicting his death
 and funeral barge.Horatia's cradle is 
 also on display.
