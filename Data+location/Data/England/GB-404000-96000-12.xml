		<content> This site has been in regular use by  
 people for centuries.Originally it was
 the site of an iron age hill fort.Good
 use was made of the natural defences  
 provided by the area and large dykes  
 were also built.Parts of these are    
 still visible.                        
    Remains from this original         
 settlement have been found and are now
 in various local museums.It is claimed
 that the site was an important port in
 early times_second in importance only 
 to the port at Hengistbury Head.As    
 this was an international port of some
 consequence perhaps Dudsbury was busy.
    The Romans perhaps used the site.  
 It reverted to use as pasture land for
 many years belonging to the Wimborne  
 estate until 1931 when it passed into 
 the hands of the Dorset Girl Guide    
 Association.
