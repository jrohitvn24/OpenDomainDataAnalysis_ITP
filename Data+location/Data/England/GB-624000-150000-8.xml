		<content>  Nonington Church of England Primary  
 School is a small village school. The 
 building dates from 1861 and consisted
 of a hall and two classrooms. The     
 toilets used to be outside and they   
 often froze in the winter.            
  One hundred years ago there were over
 one hundred children at the school.   
 The children were often kept away from
 school to go crow scaring, pick crops 
 or go stone gathering.                
  The punishments used to be very      
 severe, for instance in the punishment
 book we read that a girl was given    
 three strokes of the cane for making  
 an impudent gesture.
