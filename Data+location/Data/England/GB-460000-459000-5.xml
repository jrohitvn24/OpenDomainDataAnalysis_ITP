		<content> For our information on Lifestyles we  
 have interviewed people of different  
 ages and found that most people like  
 Pop Music, and WHAM! is the favourite 
 group.{Leisure time}is spent visiting 
 friends, gardening or doing odd jobs  
 around the house. When people{go out  
{for a meal}they prefer to go to a     
 restaurant. The most popular starter  
 for adults was prawn cocktail, the    
 main course, steak or chicken, and    
 sweet, fruit salad or gateaux.        
 Childrens favourite meal was fish and 
 chips and ice cream. Most adults      
 prefer wine with their meal whilst    
 the children prefered Coke. If        
 children stayed in to watch{television
 they would probably look for a comedy 
 or a lifelike programme like          
 Eastenders, but adults would look for 
 plays or soap operas like Dynasty.    
 That is our Life style in Strensall.  </content>
