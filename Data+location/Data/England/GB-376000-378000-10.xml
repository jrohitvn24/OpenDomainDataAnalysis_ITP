		<title>10ST. JOHN'S WOOD C.P. SCHOOL</title>
		<content> The school was built in 1970 to take  
 the children from the new Longridge   
 estate. Children from Shaw Heath were 
 also directed to the school.  The     
 school is semi- open plan in design.  
 Currently there are 110 children aged 
 5 to 11 on roll. These are taught in 4
 classes. School starts at 9 am and    
 closes at 3.30 pm with a mid-morning  
 and mid-afternoon break of 15 minutes.
 A cafeteria style meal is served at   
 midday.  About 60 children have free  
 school meals.  On 3 days the day      
 starts with a Religious Assembly.     
 Apart from Mathematics and Language   
 (English) much of the study is centred
 around "themes" which involve Science,
 History and Geography as this Domesday
 Project has done. There is P.E. every 
 day and swimming for the older ones   
 once a week. Children sing and play   
 percussion instruments.               </content>
