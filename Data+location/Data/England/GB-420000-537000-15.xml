		<title>15RETIRED DOCTOR</title>
		<content> Dr. Hart came from Scotland in 1953.  
 He had only one partner then but the  
 practice now has 11 doctors and has   
 30,000 patients.As a doctor on call   
 his day started with morning surgery  
 from 9a.m._11a.m.Then came house calls
 until lunchtime and again in the      
 afternoon.Evening surgery was from    
 4p.m._6p.m.and he was on call until   
 midnight.Then each doctor took it in  
 turn to go to emergency night calls.  
 With more doctors the work load is    
 shared and he even had days off! He   
 never had a mining disaster to deal   
 with but once a miner blew himself up 
 whilst laying explosives.He was also  
 police surgeon and dealt with many    
 road accidents.Patients today,he      
 believes,will not accept minor        
 illnesses but call the doctor for the 
 least thing.
