		<content> On Wednesday mornings I get up at a   
 quarter to seven. I'm always the last 
 person awake. My mum gets ready for   
 work, she works at a lady's house     
 cleaning, washing and dusting. My dad 
 is already at work; he mends motor    
 cycles. My sister and I are soon ready
 for school and we leave home at eight 
 thirty five. The school bell rings at 
 eight fifty five. Our first lesson is 
 French followed by handwriting or SRA.
 Assembly is next, taken by one of     
 the classes. At a quarter to eleven it
 is playtime when I usually play       
 elastic but if it is raining I help   
 Joanne Rive to look after the second  
 infant class. From eleven until twelve
 it is Maths. I am at present working  
 with cubes and cuboids. I live in the 
 village so at lunch time I cross the  
 road and walk home, where my mum has  
 prepared sandwiches for the family.   </content>
