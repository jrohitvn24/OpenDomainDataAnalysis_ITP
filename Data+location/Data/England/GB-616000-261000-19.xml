its name from a seventeenth century    
benefactor,Sir Robert Hitcham.The      
present school was built in 1879.In    
1965,the Modern School was opened,     
becoming a Junior Comprehensive in     
1979.For Sixth Form courses,children   
go to Thomas Mills High School in      
Framlingham.                           
  Debenham is very aware of its past   
and a History Group meets regularly.   
The Church Register,dating from 1559,  
has been card-indexed and there are    
collections of old photographs.        
  Both schools include local history   
and environmental studies in their     
work,making use of the Records Office  
in Ipswich,school log books and local  
places of interest.This term,High
