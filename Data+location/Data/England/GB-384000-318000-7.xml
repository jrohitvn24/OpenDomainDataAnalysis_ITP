		<content>In 1344 Humphrey de Hastang, Rector of 
Bradley gave some land to the village. 
Farmers rented the land,the money was  
used by the parishoners. Children of   
the parish were taught by the priest   
of the Lady Chapel who was supported   
by the endowment. Later the endowment  
was used to set up a school. This      
building is next to the present school.
The school was at times a grammar      
school. The boys were taught,reading,  
writing, arithmetic, grammar and       
classics by the master. The girls      
were taught by his wife,who also taught
the younger boys.In 1864,the school was
in two parts about 25 boys taught by   
the master and about the same number of
girls and small boys taught by his     
wife.No fees were charged.Bradley      
Endowed School Trust was set up to look
after the lands,buildings and money of 
the endowment.                         </content>
