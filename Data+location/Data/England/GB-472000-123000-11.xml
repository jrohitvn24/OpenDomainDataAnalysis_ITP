		<title>11TARO FAIR AT PETERSFIELD</title>
		<content> Taro fair is held every year on the   
 6th October at the Heath. It is a     
 noisy place with people laughing,     
 shouting, screaming and yelling. There
 are lots of games, toys, rides and    
 roundabouts. The things I like best   
 are Touch-a-Bag and the Ghost Train.  
 Some people like to buy candyfloss,   
 which is all sticky and looks like    
 cotton wool. There are games where you
 go up in a cage which is like a sort  
 of lift and when you come down you    
 sway. There are two or three          
 roundabouts with animals on, like     
 elephants, giraffes, monkeys and other
 sorts. The Ghost Train is all spooky  
 and scarey. There are two or three    
 sweet stalls which are full of sweets 
 and candyfloss. There are hot dog     
 stalls too. Everyone has a good time.
