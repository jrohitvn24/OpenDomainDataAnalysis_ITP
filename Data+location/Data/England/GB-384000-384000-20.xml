		<content> Manor(W.B.Hesketh) to erect a handsome
 Hotel in the place of the old village 
 inn,"The Horse and Jockey".This is of 
 course "The Hesketh Arms".            
 In 1869 Warehousemen and Clerks School
 (now Cheadle Hulme School) moved to   
 Cheadle Hulme and the Anglican        
 scholars began to worship each Sunday 
 at All Saints.A pupil who was there   
 from 1883 to 1888 remembers how they  
 used to march to church twice every   
 Sunday in all weathers and on dark    
 nights the big boys would carry       
 lanterns to light them along the way. 
 A church extension was eventually     
 needed to accommodate the increased   
 congregation and in 1877 William      
 Bradshaw Watson gave land for this.   
 Cheadle Hulme has grown tremendously  
 since 1945 as a residential area for  
 Stockport and Manchester.The present  
 vicar is the Rev.Neil Brunning.       </content>
