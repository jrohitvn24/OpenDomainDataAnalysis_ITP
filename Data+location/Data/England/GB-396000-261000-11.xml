		<content> The food which people ate was much    
 plainer than that eaten today. Village
 people grew vegetables and fruit in   
 their own gardens and often kept hens 
 and sometimes a pig.                  
 Every year a Harvest Supper was held  
 in the Village Hall when everyone had 
 a good feast.
