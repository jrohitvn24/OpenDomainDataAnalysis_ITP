 How many different types of animal are
 on the farm?                          
                                       
 Mr. Day and his wife have Jersey cows,
 horses, mastiffs, bulls and a few     
 chickens.                             
                                       
 Describe the countryside around the   
 farm :                                
                                       
 It looks very green, lots of grassy   
 fields and bits of woodland here and  
 there. Some of the fields have crops  
 in and others have been put out to    
 pasture. Not much land is wasted      
 here.                                 
 In the distance wecould see a strange 
 tower in Combe Wood. Mr. Day said it  
 was a "folly" built by an eccentric   
 Victorian.                            </content>
