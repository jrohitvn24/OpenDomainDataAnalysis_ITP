		<title>13Changing times in St.Albans.</title>
		<content>  2 old people told us about{60 years  
{of changes.}It is much bigger.The big 
 houses in{St.Peters St.}have gone and 
 it is all shops,while the little      
 bakers,butchers and general stores in 
 places like{St.Michaels}have been     
 turned into houses.Places like{Fish-  
{pool St.}and St.Michaels were slums,  
 where poor people lived.Now these are 
 the most expensive areas.They remember
 the blacksmith's,now converted into a 
 1 bedroom cottage and just sold for   
 Â£65000.There was a{factory }where the 
 modern{Gonnerston houses}are.The vicar
 of St.Michaels lived in a cottage and 
 the{school}had only 2 classrooms.There
 were lots{more pubs.}You could{swim}in
 the{lake}when the men first dug it.{  
{King Harry Lane}and {Bluehouse Hill}  
 are now fast,modern roads,then they   
 were narrow leafy lanes.We had 3      
 stations and there were trams.        </content>
