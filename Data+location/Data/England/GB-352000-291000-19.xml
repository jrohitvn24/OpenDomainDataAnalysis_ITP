 all,and 275 copies are published every
 month.It is printed in the local      
 school on a Roneo duplicator by a team
 of volunteers.The cost is met by      
 subscribers who pay 10p for a copy,and
 by the 3 dozen dvertisers.It contains 
 a monthly letter from the Rector,lists
 of service times for each{church}also 
 rotas for flower arranging and brass  
 cleaning.In addition to these,many    
 local societies publish their news and
 advertise their coming events.In this 
 way we can all keep in touch with our 
 local community.
