		<title>20A RISELEY PARTY(2)</title>
		<content>      A buffet was arranged - cold     
 turkey, ham, beef, and sausage rolls  
 accompanied by a selection of salads  
 and pickles.  The sweets were gateaux,
 cheese-cakes, fresh-fruit salad and   
 trifle, followed by cheese and        
 biscuits.  White wine was available   
 during the meal.                      
      Towards the end of the meal a    
 celebration wine was distributed and, 
 with a humorous speech, a cousin      
 proposed the toast of Jill, who, in   
 response, cut a special birthday cake 
 and offered a piece to everyone.      
      Dancing followed and at the stoke
 of midnight a group of girls gave Jill
 her 'bumps' - twenty one tosses into  
 the air.  Next day all her gifts were 
 opened and each must be acknowledged  
 by a letter of thanks or a visit to   
 the donor.                            
                                       </content>
