		<title>09RAF CROUGHTON - US BASE 1</title>
		<content> MoD land at RAF Croughton houses units
 of the US Air Force.  An RAF flying   
 station was originally built on 694   
 acres from 3 farms.  Buildings from   
 Rectory Farm are still used on the    
 base.  The concrete taxiway from the  
 flying days is now a perimeter road,  
 and the fighter pens and other        
 tracks and pads are still in          
 existence.                            
 The USAF arrived in the 1950's in the 
 role it holds today, communications.  
 Since 1 Oct 1984, the major unit has  
 been designated the 2130th Information
 Systems Sqn.  They provide a          
 comprehensive communications facility 
 to US and NATO troops worldwide.  The 
 antennae, satellite dishes and        
 conspicuous "golf balls" scattered on 
 the original grass runway sites       
 provide a distinctive landmark.
