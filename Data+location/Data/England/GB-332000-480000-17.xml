		<title>17ROUDSEA WOOD-HOLKER MOSS</title>
		<content>   Roudsea Wood and Mosses National{   
{Nature Reserve}was first established  
 in 1955.It now covers 276 hecatres.It 
 consists of an exceptionally diverse{ 
{woodland}which merges in the east with
 an estuarine{raised mire}complex known
 as the{mosses.}(Norse meaning peatbog)
   The woodland covers two ridges of   
 contrasting geology separated by a    
 shallow valley which contains a mire  
 and a small tarn.The east ridge is{   
{Carboniferous Limestone}and the west  
 ridge is of{Bannisdale Slate.}These   
 result in contrasting alkaline and    
 acid soils and hence,different types  
 of vegetation.The mire was once       
 salt-marsh when sea levels were lower.
   The great variety of vegetation and 
 wildlife has caused the wood to be    
 designated a Grade 1 site of Special  
 Scientific Interest by the{Nature     
{Conservancy Council}who manage it.    </content>
