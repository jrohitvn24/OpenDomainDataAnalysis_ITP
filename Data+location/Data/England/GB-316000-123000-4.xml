		<title>04Train Tragedy in 1940</title>
		<content> On the night of 4th Nov.1940, the 9.30
 p.m. Express from Paddington was late 
 arriving at Taunton and the signalman 
 gave priority to a newspaper train    
 coming through on time. The Express   
 was put on the relief line which      
 merged with the main line just before 
 Norton Fitzwarren station.            
 Unfortunately the driver of the       
 Express did not realize he had been   
 diverted and watched the signals set  
 for the train on the main line.  He   
 realized too late to prevent his King 
 George IV engine being derailed where 
 the quadrupled track ends.  Six       
 coaches were strewn across all four   
 tracks, killing 27 of the 900         
 passengers.  The newspaper train      
 escaped without damage, although it   
 stopped briefly at the Victory        
 crossing to investigate the light blow
 it had received at the rear.          </content>
