		<content> One of the 'highlights' of the        
 village year is the carnival. It is   
 not an old tradition as it started in 
 1956 when an 'Old Tyme' Dance Club    
 which had some spare money decided to 
 stage a carnival. The centrepiece of  
 the carnival is the procession which  
 is comprised of floats, a brass band, 
 jazz bands, a carnival queen and      
 individuals in fancy dress. The fair  
 also comes to the village. There are  
 roundabouts, amusements and sideshows 
 on the green. Other attracions of a   
 'fun' weekend are a 'Bonny Baby'      
 competition, a talent contest and     
 races, as well as writing, painting,  
 drawing and many other competitions.  
 On Saturday 13th July it was this     
 years carnival. People dressed up in  
 all kinds of unusual costumes. There  
 was Torvil &amp; Dean on rollerskates and 
 a space man who won first prize.      </content>
