		<title>10Housing in Alvechurch.</title>
		<content> In Alvechurch we have an assortment of
 different houses, old, new, historic, 
 mock Tudor, detached, terraced, semi  
 detached, bungalows and maisonettes.  
  These are spread all over Alvechurch,
 and some older houses are 3 storey    
 buildings.                            
  The historic buildings are the Fish  
 and Chip shop, Prettys the Baker, and 
 we also have 29 listed buildings. One 
 of the listed buildings is the "Old   
 House" at the top of Bear Hill, a     
 Tudor house which Shakespeare is said 
 to have visited.                      
  A few estate houses are council      
 properties, but most are privately    
 owned. People with special needs are  
 catered for. One house in Snake Lane  
 is home for few women living in the   
 community.
