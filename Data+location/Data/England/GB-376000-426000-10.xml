		<title>10The New By-Pass</title>
		<content>    The Accrington Easterly by-pass    
provides the final stage of the high   
standard route,from the Calder Valley  
towns of north-east Lancashire to the  
M62 and the Manchester conurtation. It 
will also allow traffic between        
Haslingden and the north to join the   
M62 at Huncoat and avoid the use of the
existing poorly aligned sections of the
A56 and the A180 and the built up areas
of Burnley and Accrington.             
     The road is 285m above sea level  
at the highest point,and it runs       
parellel to the old pack horse route   
kno as the "Kings High Way".The rising 
bridge round about (which was completed
in December 1981) at the Northern end  
connects with the completed link road  
from the M65 moterway.The Accrington   
easterly by-pass is 5.41m long and 573m
wide and 1,009,500 cubic metres of rock
and other substances were removed.     </content>
