		<content> Enfield Palace was built for Elizabeth
 I by her brother Edward. Pearson's    
 store now stands in the place of the  
 Palace. The restaurant has been named 
 after the Cedar tree in the grounds of
 the Palace. It became famous because  
 it grew to a massive height. It was   
 planted by Sir Robert Uvedale who was 
 a famous botanist and also master of  
 the Enfield Grammar School for many   
 years. The tree survived until this   
 century, when it was pulled down to   
 make way for a shopping precinct,     
 which stands today. There is no       
 evidence that Elizabeth lived in the  
 Palace after she was crowned Queen,   
 but she did before. When it was       
 destroyed the oak panelling, fireplace
 &amp; two decorated ceilings were sold &amp;  
 erected in a house in Gentleman's Row.
 In its time the Palace was used as a  
 private school &amp; a post office.       </content>
