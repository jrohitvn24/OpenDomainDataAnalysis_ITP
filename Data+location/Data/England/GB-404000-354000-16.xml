		<content>     The Peak Park Residential Home for
the Elderly is housed in the old       
vicarage at the edge of the village of 
Onecote.  The Home offers long- and    
short-term accommodation with personal 
care and attention 24 hours a day.     
There is an intercom in all bedrooms   
and an emergency call system in all    
bathrooms and toilets.  There is also a
stair-lift to the first floor.         
     The home opened around October    
1984 and can cater for 10 residents.   
At the moment these are all ladies.    
They have single or shared             
accommodation.                         
     A hairdresser, chiropodist and a  
physiotherapist visit regularly and    
there are library and dry cleaning     
services available.                    
     There is a garden in which the    
residents can relax and visitors are   
welcome at any reasonable time.        </content>
