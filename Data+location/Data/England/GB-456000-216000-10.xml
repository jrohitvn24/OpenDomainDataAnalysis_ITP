 There are alot of children who like   
outdoor games, such as 40-40,          
football, riding, biking, netball and  
tig.                                   
 Most people on the other hand like    
indoor games, some of them are         
Four-in-a-row, craft cards and Elite,  
which is a computer game.              
 One person in school likes Judo       
which you can't do at home so you have 
to go to a Sports Centre, the same     
with Squash.                           
 Lots of children collect things such  
as shells, keyrings, rubbers,          
bookmarkers, postcards and fossils.    
 Lots of people like fishing near the  
River Ray where it is not so fast.     
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
