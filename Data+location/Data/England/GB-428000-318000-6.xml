		<content>{Potteries}began here around 1790 and  
 that industry specialised in producing
 fireclay products for the iron &amp; steel
 industry.Although there have been many
 changes of ownership that first busi- 
 ness still exists today in the form of
{Thomas Wragg &amp; Sons.}Several other    
 potteries were established in the     
 first quarter of the 19th Century,most
 of them specialising in domestic      
 stoneware.No business was very large, 
 the  biggest having 6 kilns,&amp; others  
 only 2 or 3.                          
{The Public Health Act of 1875}encour- 
 aged many firms to switch to drainpipe
 &amp; sanitary ware in a boom which went  
 on into the 20th. Century.            
 With much of the local clay now worked
 out the potteries continue to flourish
 though fewer in number, specialising  
 in drainpipes and domestic stoneware.
