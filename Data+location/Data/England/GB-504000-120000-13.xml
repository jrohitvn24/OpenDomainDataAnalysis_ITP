		<title>13COLLEGE OF HORTICULTURE</title>
		<content>  The Horticultural Unit of the West   
 Sussex College of Agriculture and     
 Horticulture started in 1965. It has  
 about 1 acre of heated glasshouses and
 polythene tunnels.                    
  Tomatoes and cucumbers are raised in 
 a range of alternative growing        
 systems. Year round chrysanthemiums   
 and alstroemeria are grown as cut     
 flowers,the glasshouses being lit     
 artificially at night. Other crops    
 include poinsettias, mushrooms and    
 fruit growing in a small orchard.     
  The College maintains a small apiary 
 in the orchard. As well as giving     
 demonstrations to schools and tuition 
 for students, Brinsbury is also used  
 for meetings and conventions by the   
 West Sussex Beekeepers Association.   
  3 staff supervise courses for the    
 National Certificate in Horticulture  
 and City and Guilds examinations.     </content>
