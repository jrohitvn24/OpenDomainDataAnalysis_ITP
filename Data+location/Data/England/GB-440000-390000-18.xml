 Some of te games we play at school ar3
 rounders, cricket, high low swing,    
 dolly pepper choice, marbles, hop     
 scotch and catch.  We play Fairies and
 Witches. This is where someone swings 
 the rope round and round and others   
 try to jump it. We shout fairies and  
 witches. If your foot catches it when 
 we shout witches you are a witch and  
 also you are on. The same goes for    
 fairies. Another of our favourite     
 games is bad eggs. To play you need   
 four or more players standing in a    
 circle. One person with a ball walks  
 behind the others and drops the ball  
 behind someone. He or she then runs   
 around the circle. The nearest member 
 in the circle gets the ball and it it 
 is thrown from player to player around
 the circle. If the ball beats the     
 runner the player tries again.        </content>
