		<content>  Today,July 15th,we went to{Northdown 
{Farm,Sutton Poyntz.}The farm has been 
 owned by the Saunders Family since    
 1907,though it has been there since   
 Roman Times.There are 330 acres and   
 all but the 25 acres used for Barley  
 are for grazing cattle.               
  The farm has 90 cows and 83 were in  
 milking.They were mostly Friesians but
 some were Guernseys.These give less   
 milk but it is richer.The cows which  
 give the most milk eat the most food. 
  The cows eat cattle cake,which is    
 made from little pellets.The pellets  
 are fed to the cows as they are being 
 milked in the {abreast parlour.}(You  
 can have rotary or herringbone        
 parlours)The cows give about          
 1042 litres a day.Each cow gives about
 10-11 litres  a day.In Summer the cows
 eat grass.In Winter they eat silage   
 and hay instead of grass.             </content>
