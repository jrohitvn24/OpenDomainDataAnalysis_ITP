		<title>02BURGHLEY: WOODLAND WALK</title>
		<content> We arrived at Burghley park and       
 quickly got into groups and were shown
 where to go.Looking through a gate we 
 saw a dark muddy track.Our job was to 
 measure ten metres then identify      
 trees.When we were walking through the
 wood it felt like the trees were going
 to fall on us because it was very     
 windy.In the wood it smelt of animal  
 droppings.Then a little further on it 
 smelt very fresh.It was terribly      
 overgrown with nettles and cow parsley
 .There were lots of dead trees around.
 When we got into the wood we saw a    
 hare,and some baby pheasants trying to
 fly.About half way into the woods we  
 came across a clearing.It was a       
 Roman road called Ermine street.After 
 the clearing was a big muddy puddle   
 which Julia got stuck in.Nearby we    
 found a pheasants egg shell.
