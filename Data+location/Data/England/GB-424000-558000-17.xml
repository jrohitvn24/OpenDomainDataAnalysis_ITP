		<content> It is believed that there was a       
 hospital on the Sheriff Hill site in  
 medieval times but nothing remains of 
 this early building. Many years ago it
 was the Sheriff Hill Infectious       
 Diseases Hospital. Visitors had to    
 stand outside and look in the window. 
 In 1948 the hospital was opened by the
 Queen Mother. The outpatients         
 department was added in 1967 by Robert
 Howard McKenzie Stewart Esq. M.D.     
 Further extensions have opened over   
 the years, the latest is due to open  
 in January 1986.                      
 The hospital is serviced by ambulances
 from Gateshead, Blaydon, Washinton,   
 Hebburn and Newcastle. It has 4       
 Operating Theatres and 295 beds, 3 of 
 which are private.A new extension     
 will add 200 new beds. A Laser for    
 Cancer was bought by public fund      
 raising events.                       </content>
