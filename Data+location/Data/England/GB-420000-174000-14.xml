 There are 2 pubs in Obourne St George.
 The New Inn is easier to get to and is
 easier to park your car,so most people
 go there.You have to cross a busy road
 to get to the Robin Hood.             
 Friday night, Saturday and Sunday     
 midday are the busiest times for the  
 pubs,with about 45 customers mainly   
 from the village but some customers   
 come from Marlborough.                
 Men go mainly on a Saturday and the   
 women go at the weekends. In the New  
 Inn children are allowed to stay with 
 their parents but are not allowed in  
 on their own. The Robin Hood doesn't  
 have a garden. Both pubs serve food   
 as well as drinks and both have a     
 games room.
