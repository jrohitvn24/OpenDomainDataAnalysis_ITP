 Holmes went to see Jimmy in Hospital.

 people.  It took place on November    
 18th, on the grave stone it says "In  
 Loving Memory of Paul and Darren      
 Holmes who died on a railway, picking 
 coal on November 11th 1984" and at the
 bottom it says. "They have gone from  
 our lives, but not from our hearts."
