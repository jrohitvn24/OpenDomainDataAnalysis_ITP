		<title>19Flemish Farm Windsor</title>
		<content> On Monday 10th June we visited{Flemish
{Farm}in Windsor Gt. Park. The farm was
 built in 1880 and was named after a   
 favourite Royal dog.                  
 For many years the buildings were used
 for hens and later became derelict.   
 Today the farm buildings are just     
 used to accommodate{Polo Ponies}for   
{'Guards' Polo Club.}There are over    
 ninety horses, some of them costing up
 to Â£16000. The best polo ponies are   
 imported from Argentina. This is a    
 very expensive sport since a club polo
 player may need four horses.          
 The farm employs a manager and up to  
 23 staff. Most of them are girls who  
 work from 6.30a.m. until 8.30p.m. as  
 grooms. At 16yrs. they are paid Â£45.  
 Flemish Farm is not a typical farm but
 is located in{Windsor Gt. Park}as Polo
 is regularly played at Smiths Lawn by 
{Prince Charles.                       </content>
