		<content> In this area 35% of the population are
 elderly. They do not have free bus    
 passes, but if an elderly person is on
 Supplementary benefit they will get   
 Â£15 a year in bus tokens. There are   
 three sorts of special accommodation  
 for the elderly: MUIR HOUSE is 50     
 self-contained flats 26 single and    
 24 double, and a warden's bungalow.   
 Each flat has a bathroom, kitchen and 
 a large bedsitting room in the singles
 and a sittling room and bedroom in the
 doubles. The warden is on call 24     
 hours a day. ASHDEAN is a rest home   
 where they have their own room, but   
 meals are cooked for them and the     
 cleaning done, etc. LITTLE HAVEN is a 
 nursing home where the person can get 
 24 hours a day care and attention. The
 COUSINS DAY CENTRE is somewhere they  
 can do handicrafts and meet friends.
