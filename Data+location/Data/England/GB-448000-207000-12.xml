		<title>12  College Scouts,Oxford</title>
		<content> The college servants or "scouts",     
begin work at 8.30. They "clock in" and
collect their cleaning equipment from  
personal lockers. Each scout has ten   
rooms to clean every day from Monday to
Friday. During term time the rooms     
belong to the students and the scout's 
job is to tidy up generally. They make 
beds and do the washing up. In vacation
time the college has different         
conferences and the scout's work is    
like a chambermaid's.                  
 All the students in Somerville College
are girls, some have strange habits,   
leaving washing up for weeks on end and
shoving rubbish under beds. Some are in
the college rowing club and get up at 5
a.m.to row. Scouts often find them back
in  bed at 10! Things like this make a 
scout's work more interesting.         
 Their daily work finishes at 12.30.
