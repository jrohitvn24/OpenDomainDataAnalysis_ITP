		<title>18LINDSEY SCHOOL OF DANCING</title>
		<content> The dancing school meets at St.       
 George's Church in Heapham Road.The   
 age group is two to twenty and about  
 forty people go.It starts at 9.30 and 
 finishes at twelve.We do ballet,which 
 is a very delicate kind of dancing and
 tap dancing,which is quite exciting.  
 You wear some shoes with metal on the 
 heels and you tap your feet in        
 different steps.Then there is         
 Acro,which is handstands and          
 somersaults and that is a bit funny   
 when you learn new things.There also  
 are modern and disco which are very   
 similar to each other and in those you
 have to move quickly.For dancing you  
 get medals if you pass your test.I go 
 there because I really enjoy it.The   
 dancing School opened in 1983.I       
 started on the very first day.
