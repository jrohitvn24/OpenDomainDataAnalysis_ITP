		<content> The whole of Temple Wood, stretching  
 to some 226 acres falls within this   
 area. The wood is managed by the      
 Forestry Commission and is a mixture  
 of deciduous and conifer plantation,  
 mainly the former.                    
   The wood has a thinning cycle of 5  
 years with the main timber use that of
 pit prop production, second grade wood
 being shredded for use as chipboard or
 pulped for paper.                     
   Within the wood in addition to Beech
 and Birch are several young Oaks of   
 about 40 years of age and the rarer   
 species of Small-leaved Lime, Wild    
 Service, Giant Fir, Corsican Pine and 
 Aspen.                                
   Some of the rarer flowers to be     
 found within the wood include Adders  
 Tongue(Arum), Herb Paris(Lily family) 
 and certain species of Orchid.
