		<content> The school was built near the Church  
 in 1838 replacing the previous build- 
 ing which stood in the Churchyard. At 
 the present time there are 56 pupils  
 with a headmaster and 2.5 teachers.   
 The rector and Methodist Minister     
 visit the school regularly to give    
 church and christian teaching, while  
 the children visit the church twice a 
 term.                                 
 At harvest time a Harvest Festival is 
 held in school, while at Christmas a  
 Carol service which includes a        
 nativity or other dramatic present-   
 ation also takes place in school.     
 In July the children from the school  
 join with other local youth groups to 
 participate in a Youth Festival held  
 in the church.  At the age of eleven  
 children leave this delightful school 
 to attend Knutsford County High       
 School.                               </content>
