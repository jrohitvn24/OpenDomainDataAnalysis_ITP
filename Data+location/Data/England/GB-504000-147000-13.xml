		<title>13A WEEKEND IN SHERE</title>
		<content>   On Sunday I went to St.James'Church 
 in Shere and I took my doll. It was   
 Mothering Sunday and there was a      
 Christening. When Rector and the      
 baby's family were all by the font,   
 the Rector put the holy water in the  
 sign of a cross on the baby's head.   
 The baby was christened Catherine and 
 she wanted to go right into the font, 
 this made everybody laugh.            
   Rector asked us to pick up the      
 christening card and we had to say a  
 special prayer. Jillian who is six    
 years old took the candle after her   
 sister had been christened. The Rector
 came behind Jillian with the baby in  
 his arms.                             
   One of the songs we sang was 'I     
 danced in the morning'. Then all the  
 children in the church went up to get 
 posies of flowers for their mothers.
