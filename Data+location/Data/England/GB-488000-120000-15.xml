		<title>15ENERGY SOURCES IN MIDHURST.</title>
		<content> There is no electricity power station.
 The supply comes in on power lines    
 carried overhead on huge pylons.The   
 whole area has access to the main     
 supply but suffers from               
 frequent,sometimes lengthy cuts when  
 high winds or lightning damage the    
 lines.                                
     Gas mains have been laid in most  
 of Midhurst.The extension of the mains
 to the rest of Midhurst is now under  
 discussion.Easebourne is on the mains 
 but there are no plans to take gas to 
 the rest of the area.                 
     There is oil underground and      
 surveys have taken place.Public       
 opinion is strongly opposed to        
 drilling and the quality and quantity 
 of oil so far struck have not been    
 good enough for commercial            
 development.Local surveying has       
 stopped at present.                   </content>
