		<title>12Peterlee And Religion.</title>
		<content> In our our interviews with them _     
 Father Meagher of the{Catholic church,
 Reverend Wodehouse of the{Anglican}and
 Mr. Lawson of the{Methodist}_ all made
 the same points about the problems of 
 Peterlee. Broken marriages and apathy 
 have led to a decline in church       
 attendance,while unemployment causes  
 family trouble. Those who are strong  
 in their faith join in the ecumenical 
 movement.                             
                                       
 Our{Catholic schools}and church are   
 joined in many ways. Children make    
 their First Communion at age 7,and are
 confirmed at about 12. Every Thursday 
 the school attends church. Special    
 occasions are marked with processions,
 plays and mimes in school. Father     
 Meagher is the school's friend,he even
 goes with the children on school      
 trips!                                </content>
