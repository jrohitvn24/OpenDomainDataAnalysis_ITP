		<content>   The only charity that has been set  
 up in this area is the Higher Line    
 Handicapped Children's Trust.This is  
 run by Stonyhurst College,and is not  
 well known.                           
   The 'Higher Line' is the top two    
 years in the College,namely the Sixth 
 Formers.Many things take place during 
 the year to raise money to provide a  
 holiday for many handicapped children.
 Things like the selling of the College
 Christmas cards,fairs,jumble sales    
 and,just recently,the addition of the 
 Rudiments' Garden Party (Rudiments is 
 the top year in the Preparatory       
 School).                              
   The Sixth Formers organise the      
 holiday,with the aid of some adult    
 trustees,and this holiday takes place 
 the week after school has broken up.
