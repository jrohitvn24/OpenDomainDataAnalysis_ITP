		<content>    There is no longer any school here 
 and all children have to travel out of
 the area to receive their formal      
 education. For the youngest children a
 playgroup is run once a week in the   
 old Sunday School room. In 1985 seven 
 children attend this group. Some older
 pre-school children also attend the   
 Group held twice a week at Dolphin-   
 holme School and some of the children 
 of primary school age go on to this   
 school. The remainder of the children 
 under 12 attend Abbeystead School.    
 Practically all children of secondary 
 age go to school in Lancaster where   
 the choice of school is still limited 
 by the 11+ examination. Leaving home  
 for further education is quite rare   
 but some of the teenagers not staying 
 on to the sixthform attend courses at 
 Morecambe College of Further Education
 or Winmarleigh College of Agriculture.</content>
