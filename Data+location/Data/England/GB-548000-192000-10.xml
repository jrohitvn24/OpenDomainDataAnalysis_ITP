		<content> He dreamt that he was being chased by 
 the trees that he chopped down.He     
 dreamt that there were bits of trees  
 running after him.They trapped him    
 into an alley and started beating him 
 up.All of a sudden he got out a flick 
 knife from his pocketand started      
 cutting the trees down.Suddenly Daddy 
 tree came along and beat up the       
 vandal.                               
                                       
 Suddenly the vandal woke up and       
 said,"Cor,that was a bad dream."      
                                       
 He looked in the mirror and saw that  
 he had cuts and bruises on his face.
