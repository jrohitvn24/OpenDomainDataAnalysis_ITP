		<title>10FARMING IN BEER</title>
		<content> Farming like fishing would have played
 a greater part in the past.           
    Being a rural area there are still 
 farms around Beer and almost in the   
 village itself.                       
    The farming is a mixture between   
 dairying,cereal growing and sheep for 
 the main part.                        
    Because the soil is often shallow  
 and stoney ,this type of farming suits
 the area.                             
    Farmers often supplement their     
 income by taking in visitors or having
 caravans on their land during the     
 summer months.                        
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
