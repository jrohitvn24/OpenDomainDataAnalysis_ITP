		<content> My dad is the manager of a factory    
 called Technacryl. It has been in     
 existence for eighteen years. They    
 make acrylic furniture. They buy      
 perspex and manufacture it into       
 various goods like coffee tables,     
 dining tables, chairs, pencil         
 holders and signs. They sell some     
 goods abroad. The factory used to be  
 stables which have now been changed   
 into workshops. Ten people work there 
 altogether. Two boys who live near    
 sometimes help. There are seven       
 workshops. The perspex is cut in one  
 and sent into another to be made into 
 furniture. There is another workshop  
 for polishing the furniture and quite 
 a big one for packing. It is wrapped  
 in bubble_craft which is a sort of    
 polythene with bubbles, which keeps   
 the furniture safe while it is being  
 transported.                          </content>
