 Each year in July Blyth has a         
 carnival. Carnival day is a special   
 day for Blyth because it helps to     
 raise money for charities and is fun  
 as well. Trucks come around (called   
 floats)with people dressed up on them.
 People come around with buckets to    
 collect money. After the procession   
 everyone goes to a field, called Croft
 Park, where there are amusements and  
 stalls where you can win prizes.      
    Last year there was a display by   
 the Red Arrows, who are an aerobatics 
 display team. The Army also did a     
 display and so did a B.M.X. bicycle   
 stunt team.
