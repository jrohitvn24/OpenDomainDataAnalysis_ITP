		<content>    The land here is either farmed or  
 cultivated as natural woodland or     
 forestry plantation, so there are     
 very few people actually living in the
 area. Those who are resident are      
 mostly farmers and farm-workers and   
 those otherwise employed in           
 agriculture, and there are a few      
 private dwellings.                    
    The houses are isolated and have   
 few amenities in the way of local     
 services. Cottages no longer required 
 for farm-workers are sometimes let on 
 a temporary basis, and the presence of
 one or two caravans in private gardens
 suggests a transient summer visitor   
 poulation of relatives and friends.   
    Some agricultural and forestry     
 workers live in neighbouring villages 
 and use their own transport to get to 
 work.                                 
                                       </content>
