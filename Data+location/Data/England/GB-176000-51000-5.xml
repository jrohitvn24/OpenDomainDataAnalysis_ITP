 Perranwell was once known as Fenlen   
 Perran.It got it's name from St.Pirans
 Well which is in the grounds of the   
 mill.                                 
  There are less houses in the hamlet  
 now than there used to be,the old ones
 were built of cob and have now fallen 
 down.There are about forty two houses 
 now in total which includes Lambourne 
 Mill.This was last used as a mill in  
 1954 and it has now been converted    
 into a house.                         
  A granite celtic cross stands in the 
 grounds of a park in Perranwell called
 Silverbow.This is used to mark the    
 boundary between Lord Falmouth's      
 estate and Chiverton estate.          
  About two hundred and ten people live
 in Perranwell and only ten children.  
 The majority of the residents are     
 retired business people.              </content>
