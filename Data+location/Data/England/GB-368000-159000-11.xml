		<title>11PRISTON MILL</title>
		<content> Alongside Priston Mill Farm is an     
 historic cornmill, recorded in the    
 original Domesday survey, and still in
 commercial use today. The mill is     
 powered by a large waterwheel, fed by 
 the Conygre brook, and mainly used for
 grinding the farm's wheat into flour, 
 which is then packed and distributed  
 to local grocers and bakers. Today's  
 growing demand for wholewheat flour is
 keeping the mill in daily use during  
 the summer season. The mill is open to
 the public at certain times and       
 proving to be a popular tourist       
 attraction, along with the farm shop  
 and small cafe.                       
 A joint tour of mill and farm can make
 an informative and enjoyable day out. 
 The farmer is aiming to increase the  
 tourist aspect of the farm
