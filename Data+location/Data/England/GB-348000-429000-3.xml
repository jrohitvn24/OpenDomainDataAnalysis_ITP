		<title>03A day in the life of...</title>
		<content> Children in my school seem to have    
 very similar life styles.I get up at  
 7.00am and get dressed. At about      
 7.15am I have my breakfast of cereal  
 and a drink of tea. At about 8.15am I 
 call for my friend Karen Bailey who   
 lives down the road from me.I go to St
 Bernards Junior school and it starts  
 at 8.40am.In the morning we do our    
 basic work.At 10.30am we have         
 playtime.At 12.00 it is dinner time   
 and some children have school dinners 
 but I bring packed lunches.Sometimes  
 after dinner I go on the computer.We  
 have lessons from 1.15,playtime from  
 2.20-2.30 and we go home at           
 3.15pm.Sometimes after school I play  
 with Karen and after tea I often watch
 T.V.and go to bed at about 10.00pm.
