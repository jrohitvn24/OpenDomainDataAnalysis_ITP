		<content> This area has probably been           
 continuously settled for at least 5000
 years from Neolithic Man to the Romans
 to the present day.Today most of its  
 population lives in the small         
 nucleated village of East Meon.Some   
 people also live in the smaall Hamlets
 of Frogmore (east of East Meon) and   
 Ramsdean (north of Butser Hill).The   
 rest of the population lives in the 14
 or so scattered farms (such as South  
 Farm,Preston Farm and Harroway Farm)  
 and in the 2 or 3 large houses (such  
 as Oxenbourne House and Leythe House  
 and in 1 or 2 groups of isolated      
 cottages (e.g Fishpond Cottages).The  
 steep slopes of Butser Hill in the    
 south of the area are today unused for
 permanent settlement although the     
 presence of Tumuli and Cross-Dykes    
 testify to their attraction for       
 earlier inhabitants of this area.     </content>
