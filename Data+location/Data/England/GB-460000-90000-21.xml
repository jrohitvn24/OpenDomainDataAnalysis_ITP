<title>21Bishop Lovett Middle School October 2011</title>
<content>

Bishop Lovett (Church of England) Middle School closed just three months ago on 21 July 2011.&lt;br />&lt;br />However, the school buildings, playing fields and extensive grounds that it vacated are now being used as a primary school (i.e. for children aged 4 to 11).&lt;br />&lt;br />All "middle" schools on the Isle of Wight closed in July 2011 as the school system was changed from a 3 tier system (of primary schools, middle schools, and high schools) to a 2 tier system (primary schools and colleges/acadamies). The 3 tier system ended with the end of the school year in July 2011; the new 2 tier system started with the new school year in September 2011.   &lt;br />
