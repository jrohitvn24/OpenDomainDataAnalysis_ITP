 the edge of the village is a small    
{paint factory}which employs a number  
 of local people. The main London to   
 Dover railway line passes just to the 
 north of the village.                 
 "What are people currently talking &amp;  
 thinking about ?"  When asked, the    
 people of the village icluded a number
 of topics.  Their chief hope was for  
 an improvement in community life.     
 Many were concerned with the increase 
 in crime, especially burglaries,      
 vandalism &amp; safety of their children. 
 A Neighbourhood Watch scheme is to be 
 introduced. Some were worried about   
 the effect of cost cuts on education &amp;
 health services.  Other concerns      
 included violence on tv, erosion of   
 moral standards and the breakup of    
 family life.
