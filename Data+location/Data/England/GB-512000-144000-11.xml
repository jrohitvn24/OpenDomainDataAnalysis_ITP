 The North-West corner is distinguished
 by the large Manor House known as     
 Wotton House.  The original brick     
 home, bought by George Evelyn in l599,
 has been altered and added to many    
 times.  The Orangery was designed by  
 William Kent.  The old library was    
 built by Nicholas Hawksmoor and in    
 l864 the 'Gothic' library was added.  
 This last is used for concerts and    
 lectures now.  There is now no visible
 trace of the original house which was 
 Tudor.                                
                                       
 The house has belonged to the Evelyn  
 family for 400 years.  The most famous
 Evelyn - John Evelyn of the Diary -   
 laid out the gardens, which have in   
 part survived.  (The famous Diary was 
 kept for 3 centuries at Wotton House,
