		<content>  {ALNE COUNTY PRIMARY SCHOOL}         
 In Alne there have been three schools 
 including the present one.It is a     
 modern school building with three     
{classrooms}which are open on one side.
 Two junior classrooms share an        
 art area.                             
 We have a spare temporary classroom   
 which is used for music.There are     
 three{teachers}and one part time      
 teacher.We have a heated open air     
 swimming pool and a large field use   
 for sports.There are{74children}in the
 school and most come to school by a   
 special school bus which brings       
 children from the villages of         
 Aldwark,Flawith and Tholthorpe.The    
 rest of the children come from Alne or
 they are brought to school by their   
 parents in cars from Newton-on-Ouse   
 and Tollerton.Most children live      
 in Alne.                              </content>
