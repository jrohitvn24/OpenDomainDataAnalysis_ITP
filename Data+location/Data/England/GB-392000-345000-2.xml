		<title>02Trade in Werrington</title>
		<content>There are three groups of shops in     
Werrington.They range from small       
hairdressers to supermarkets.Also      
newsagents,butchers,chemists,off       
licences,greengrocers and sport shops  
are here.Most of the shops are family  
businesses which range from 3-50 years 
old,some of the shops have been        
modernised to become more welcoming.   
   The height of business in the week  
at most of the shops appears to be the 
weekend period,starting Friday night   
and ending early Monday morning.The    
main height of business in the year for
75% of the shops is the Christmas      
season and special occasions.          
   A lot of the shops(especially       
newsagents and bakeries)begin to fill  
up at lunchtime(12-1)as children come  
out of school.The shops overall get    
quite good business throughout the     
year.                                  </content>
