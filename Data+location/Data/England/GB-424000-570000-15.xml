		<content> George Stephenson is connected with   
Killingworth, for he was an engineer at
Killingwoth Colliery. He tried out his 
first engine on the old Killingworth   
Wagon Way. There is a memorial stone   
at the top of the village. Sandra Black

Killingworth was a mining village- two 
pubs, a shop, and a few pit cottages.  
In winter, people used to go skating on
pond. When there was horse-racing at   
Gosforth Park the horses were brought  
to Killingworth Station, then walked up
the road to Gosforth Park.             
 People's lives have changed as well.  
On washing day children's mothers would
give them tuppence to get their tea,   
corned beef from the shop. They would  
have a bath once a week. They would    
have it in a bath in front of the fire.
