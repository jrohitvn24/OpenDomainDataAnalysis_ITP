		<content> This impressive building, which is set
 in its own private grounds, is        
 situated almost in the centre of the  
 entire block (see page 11). Built in  
 1780 by William Markam it is now owned
 and used by the C.E.G.B. The family of
 John Fawcett bought it in 1907 and    
 owned it until 1946. The C.E.G.B.     
 bought it in 1958. Although an        
 extension has been added to the       
 original building, much of the        
 original remains, both externally and 
 internally. It has its own grounds in 
 which wildlife, including pheasants   
 and deer, abound. At present 98 people
 are employed at Becca Hall in various 
 capacities, but most are engineers.
