		<title>08FARMING AROUND TYWARDREATH</title>
		<content> We looked at a survey of{farming}from 
 20 years ago and nowadays far less    
 people are employed. Most farms are{  
{run by the family}with fathers and    
 sons or brothers working in           
 partnership to share machinery and    
 equipment. Only about 6 full time     
 workers are employed - half of them   
 are girls - but extra help is taken on
 at harvest time.                      
 Many farms in the area are{mixed      
{farms,}not only having a dairy section
 but also keeping cattle for beef.{    
 Some{sheep}are kept and{winter barley}
 is grown, but some of the land is too 
 wet and hilly for this.               
{Market gardening}also takes place in  
 our area - cabbages, lettuce and soft 
 fruit are grown and one producer is   
 now changing over to grow early       
 potatoes.                             
 There is also a{mink farm}at Treesmill</content>
