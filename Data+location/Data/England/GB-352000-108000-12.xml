		<content> Only the northern part of the village 
 comes within the block. It includes   
 the church and the school, but not the
 post office nor the pub. As at        
 Pendomer, many of the houses are old -
 several centuries in some cases - and 
 built mainly of local material, the   
 creamy grey limestone predominating.  
 They are roofed variously with slates,
 thatch or pantiles. Sometimes the     
 stone is rendered or cement-washed,   
 but the overall effect is greyish.    
 Newer dwellings include some new      
 bungalows in "reconstituted" stone,   
 and a few Victorian or later brick    
 houses, but all blend well into the   
 landscape. Most of the houses are     
 owner-occupied, and vary in size and  
 style; some are detached, some in     
 pairs or short terraces. There are    
 some 20-30 dwellings in Halstock      
 included in this block.               </content>
