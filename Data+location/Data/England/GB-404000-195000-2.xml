		<title>02NEW AND OLD SOUTH CERNEY</title>
		<content>  Many people interviewed could not    
 remember South Cerney as it was 15    
 years ago, which suggests a relatively
 new community. However, residents do  
 not want the village to grow any more 
 and lose its village atmosphere. There
 are a large number of new houses, on  
 estates, which people have moved into 
 within the last 5 to 10 years. Many   
 people suggested that they would move 
 away if the village were allowed to   
 grow into a town.                     
  The best elements of the village are 
 thought to be the older parts such as 
 the picturesque Cotswold stone houses,
 the church, the tree_ lined Silver St.
 and the village bridge.               
  Quaint street names within the       
 village include Bow Wow, Upper Up and 
 The Langet.
