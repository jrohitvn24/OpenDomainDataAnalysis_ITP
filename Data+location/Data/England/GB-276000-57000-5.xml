		<title>05Farming Methods (Harberton)</title>
		<content> Farming in the area is still a mixture
 of dairy, beef and corn.              
 On dairy farms modern milking systems 
 are usual, with some 100 to 150       
 cows - mainly Friesians, being milked 
 morning and evening in specialised    
 parlours. The milk is pumped directly 
 into large refrigerated tanks for     
 collection by bulk tankers once a day.
 Corn (barley mainly but some oats and 
 wheat) is grown either for sale to    
 corn merchants or for livestock food  
 on the farm. The practice of making   
 silage is now widespread, although hay
 is still an important crop.The big    
 round bales are becoming a familiar   
 sight , some of these being stored in 
 large plastic bags. Field size has    
 increased but most fields are still   
 bounded by traditional high Devonshire
 hedges cut by modern flail cutters.
