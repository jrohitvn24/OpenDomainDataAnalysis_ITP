My name is Antony Nannini and I am 12  
years old.I am a member of Orpington   
Swimming Club.                         
                                       
My training sessions are held on       
Monday,Tuesday,Wednesday,Thursday and  
Sunday.The sessions on Monday to       
Thursday are an hour and a half,but on 
Sunday they are for two hours.         
                                       
On a typical evening,we start with an  
800m warm up.This is followed by a     
"Main course"of around 2,000m,which may
be broken to include practice in all   
four strokes.When this is finished,we  
do turns or kicking and then a final   
1,000m,but this is split into several  
shorter swims.At the end of the        
session we do sprints of one length or 
relays.
