   Lowrie's Otford Gunroom opens from  
9.00 am. to 5.30 pm and used to be a   
hardware shop. It sells mostly rifles  
but quite a few air-rifles. The most   
powerful gun stocked was a .270 calibre
shotgun. The most expensive gun cost   
#2650 and the cheapest was a #15. air- 
rifle. They sell about 2000 clay       
pigeons a week and occasionally sell a 
crossbow. They do not sell any fishing 
tackle or riding tack but they do sell 
country clothing. Customers come from a
large area around Otford. Shortly they 
are going to cease to sell guns but    
just to repair them in a workshop at   
the back. The shop front is to be let.
