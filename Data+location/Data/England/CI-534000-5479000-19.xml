		<title>19GUERNSEY TOMATO MARKETING</title>
		<content> Once tomatoes are picked they are sent
 to the{Guernsey Tomato Marketing Board
 to be packed and{exported.}First they 
 are put into a cool room to cool off. 
 Then they go onto a set of rollers to 
 a trough of water to be cleaned.Then  
 they are dried with cool air and      
 travel past an{electronic eye}which   
 sorts them into different grades      
 according to size and colour. Very red
 or green fruit gets rejected. Then    
 they are weighed into 6kilos and      
 packed into a tray,and covered with a 
 special coloured plastic lid denoting 
 each grade. Finally they are put onto 
 a turntable and stacked up on palettes
 of 130 trays. These stacks are then   
 taken by lorry to the docks and sent  
 to the various markets in the U.K.    
 Aubergines peppers,beans radish &amp;     
 celery are also packed at the GTMB.
