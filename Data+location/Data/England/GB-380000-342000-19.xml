		<content> On the 17th June 1985, the fourth     
Potteries Marathon took place,         
sponsored by Century Oils.             
 2500 people took part including 43    
people from Limoges. Many cheering     
spectators encouraged the runners along
the 26 mile route.                     
 The weather was fine and the running  
conditions superb. 2 hours 19.5 minutes
after the 10am start the winner, Harry 
Clague from St. Helens came in.        
Clague's only opposition, Peter Orton  
from Burton came second. Third man     
home was Colin Kirkham who was also    
the first over forty veteran to cross  
the line. The first Limoges runner to  
finish was 52 year old Maurice Petit.  
Christine Kilkenny was the first lady  
to finish with 2-54-21. She easily won 
after taking the lead from Hem Heath   
Colliery. Christine received a Royal   
Doulton crystal urn as her prize.      </content>
