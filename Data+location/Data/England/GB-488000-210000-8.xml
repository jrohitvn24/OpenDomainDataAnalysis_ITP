		<content>  Shops in our area cater for immediate
 needs but most people shop in         
 main shopping areas such as TRING and 
 AYLESBURY. The shops in our area also 
 cater for old people who can't get    
 into the main shopping area but the   
 problem is that the prices are rather 
 high. The main shops in our area are  
 MACE, VG, CORNER SHOP, POST OFFICE and
 THE HANDY STORES.                     
    COOKS, MACE, VG and THE CORNER     
 SHOP are supermarkets. They sell      
 confectionery, stationery, groceries  
 and toys. The Post Office sells the   
 same except for groceries, and it runs
 a postal service.                     
    The Handy Store sells things like  
 DIY kits, torches, lightbulbs,        
 wellies, body warmers,gardening       
 materials and a few toys as well as a 
 key cutting service and a photo       
 copying service.                      </content>
