		<title>13A WALK FROM NEWLAY TO RODLEY</title>
		<content>   This walk is part of the Kirkstall  
 Valley Trail. We left school and went 
 down to Newlay Bridge, built in 1819. 
 We continued across the bridge over   
 the Leeds to Carlise railway line.    
 Through a field we came to the Leeds  
 and Liverpool canal. We walked along  
 the tow path , under bridge number 221
 looking at grooves worn by the horse  
 drawn barges.                         
   We walked past Fallwood Marina and a
 swingbridge. We went past many        
 old mills and a large crane works.    
 Continuing along the footpath we      
 passed through Rodley, under the A6120
 Ring Road bridge and down along the   
 tow path still to turn up and go over 
 the old Packhorse bridge across the   
 River Aire. We took a footpath turning
 right to walk back along the north    
 bank of the river through Thornton    
 wood across the railway back to school</content>
