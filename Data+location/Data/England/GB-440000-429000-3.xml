		<title>03Kippax Church</title>
		<content> Kippax church stands high on a vantage
 point over looking the area. There is 
 evidence of habitation in the         
 immediate locality of the church going
 as far back as the iron age. In 1948 a
 neolithic hammer head was discovered  
 in the Westfield area of Allerton     
 Bywater and in 1976 aerial photographs
 revealed an iron age sight            
 approximately one mile easy of the    
 present church. There is little       
 evidence of Saxon dwellings apart from
 the broken remains of a carved cross  
 shaft which can now be seen in the    
 vestry. There are refrances in the    
 Domesday book to ilbert de laceys land
 having 3 churches and 3 priests. The 3
 churches being Kippax, Ledston +      
 Barwick.
