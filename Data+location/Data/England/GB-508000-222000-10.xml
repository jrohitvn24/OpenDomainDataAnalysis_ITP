		<title>10LADY ZIA WERNHER SCHOOL</title>
		<content> The youngets pupil at this school is  
 two three months, the eldest is eleven
 years, but they  are no ordinary      
 pupils. They all have something in    
 common, they are all physically and   
 mentally handicapped. Both boys and   
 girls are admitted. They have special 
 bikes and do sport, but it is a bit   
 different from our sport. Thbikes cost
 around Â£250 each. The school was      
 founded in 1964, and it is not        
 private. There are 54 pupils at Lady  
 Zia Wernher. All the pupils which have
 difficulty speaking use a special     
 language using symbols. Two weeks ago 
 the pupils got back from a Y.C.A.     
 holiday in Portsmouth where they went 
 fishing, canoeing and lots of other   
 activities.
