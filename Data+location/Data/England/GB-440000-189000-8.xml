		<content>Grove Centre is attached to Millbrook  
Junior School and is a place where     
continuing education can take place,   
under the Community Education Section  
of the Education Department of         
Oxfordshire County Council. The main   
aim of community education is to help  
individuals and groups to be creative, 
active and participative within        
society; to help realise their         
potential;and to help them improve     
the quality of life. The main areas    
of the Centre's work at present        
are adult education and work with young
people. We have a staff of 70,some paid
and some voluntary but all of the      
belief that Grove Centre needs to be a 
place where our clients feel           
safe,meeting together in a             
friendly,caring and supportive         
atmosphere.Our work is with people and 
their care must be our first priority. </content>
