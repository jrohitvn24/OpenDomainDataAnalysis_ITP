		<title>09WORSBROUGH MILL MUSEUM</title>
		<content> The mill in Worsbrough is a{corn      
{mill.}It was built in two parts.The   
 first part was water powered.It was   
 built around{1625}.In the early 19th  
 century a second part to the mill was 
 built.This was powered by a{steam     
{engine}.They built it because the     
 demand for flour increased as the     
 population grew.                      
 Demand for flour from local mills     
 declined and the building fell into   
 disrepair.                            
 It was{taken over in 1974}by South    
 Yorkshire County Council, restored and
 opened as a{working museum}. Many     
 visitors come to see the working water
 powered mill and the early oil fired  
 engine which now powers the machinery 
 in the new mill.
