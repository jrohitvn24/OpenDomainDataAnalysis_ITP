		<content> Thorncombe is represented at Parish   
 Council level by nine elected members,
 all resident in the parish.  They are 
 aided by a clerk who may be paid. The 
 electorate is 532 in number.  Parish  
 councilors act mainly in a watchdog   
 capacity.  They see and make          
 recommendations on all local planning 
 applications and may provide from a   
 limited rate, amenities which are not 
 the responsibility of other           
 authorities, which are the West Dorset
 District Council and Dorset County    
 Council.  thorncombe shares with other
 parishes one representative on each of
 these bodies. Thorncombe was named    
 as a priority village in the first    
 draft plan for West Dorset Rural      
 Development in July 1985 which will   
 mean the building of more homes in
