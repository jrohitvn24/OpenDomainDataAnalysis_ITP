		<title>20THE HELM WIND IN DUFTON AREA</title>
		<content>  This is a strong wind,very local in  
 effect,which rushes from the fell &amp;   
 can persist for days,thus affecting   
 the growth of crops,especially in the 
 Spring.                               
 Because of the Helm the villages are  
 built with their backs to the fell,   
 very few older houses having windows  
 overlooking it.Knowledgeable folk,    
 sensing an easterly wind with a roar  
 above,look upwards &amp; seeing bands of  
 cloud constantly forming above the    
 fell and over the valley,can then     
 confidently say,"The Helm is on".     
 "Helm" is said to be derived from     
 "helmet",&amp; the cloud known as the Helm
 Bar.{
