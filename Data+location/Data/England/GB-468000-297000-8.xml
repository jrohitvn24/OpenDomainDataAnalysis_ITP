		<content> There are further examinations if one 
 wants to become a Master Farrier.     
 The fuel farriers use is called       
 "blacksmith's breeze" - a special type
 of washed coke which will burn cleanly
 without smoking or spitting.  The     
 shoes are made of mild steel and this 
 is bought into the forge in 18-22 feet
 lengths.  A shoe on a horse will last 
 anything from 10 days to 6 weeks,     
 depending on the horse, the rider and 
 the type of use it has.  After the 6  
 weeks have passed the hooves have     
 usually grown and the horse will need 
 re-shoeing whether the shoe has worn  
 down or not.  The old shoes are used  
 as scrap metal and sold to a dealer.  
 The charge to customers for having a  
 horse shod is around Â£24 if Mr. Deacon
 has to travel out.
