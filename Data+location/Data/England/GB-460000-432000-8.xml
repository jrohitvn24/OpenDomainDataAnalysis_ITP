		<title>08SELBY THE SWING BRIDGE</title>
		<content> THE RIVER OUSE WHICH IS TIDAL AT SELBY
 RUNS THROUGH THE CENTRE OF THE TOWN.  
 THE MAIN ROAD FROM DONCASTER TO YORK  
 ,THE A19 PASSES THROUGH THE TOWN AND  
 CROSSES THE RIVER ON AN OLD TOLL      
 BRIDGE WHICH SWINGS OPEN TO ALLOW     
 SHIPPING TO PASS.ON AVERAGE THREE     
 BOATS A DAY USE THE RIVER AT THIS     
 POINT AND THE BRIDGE WHICH IS STEEL   
 AND WOODEN IN CONSTRUCTION HAS TO     
 SWING SIX TIMES A DAY.                
 THE BRIDGE IS VERY OLD AND NEEDS      
 CONSTANT REPAIR IN ORDER TO WORK.VERY 
 OFTEN THE BRIDGE STICKS OPEN AND CUTS 
 THE ROAD BETWEEN SELBY AND            
 YORK.SOMETIMES THIS TAKES HOURS TO    
 REPAIR AND A LONG DIVERSION AROUND    
 CAWOOD IS NEEDED.TRAFFIC JAMS BUILD UP
 AND THE TOWN IS THROWN INTO CHAOS.    
 THERE IS TALK OF BUILDING A NEW BRIDGE
 THAT IS HIGH ENOUGH TO ALLOW SHIPPING 
 THROUGH.                              </content>
