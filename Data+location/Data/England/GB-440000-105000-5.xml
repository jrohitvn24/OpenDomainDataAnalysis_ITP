		<content> Employment in the area relies on the  
 petroleum and chemical industries.    
 Work is for such companies as Esso,   
 Re-Chem, etc. Esso Refinery at Fawley 
 is the largest in Europe. Many people 
 in our assigned area work in these    
 industries.                           
                                       
 There is quite a low unemployment rate
 in this area mainly because of Esso.  
 As this is a forest area there are a  
 few jobs arising from this. Forestry  
 work is quite common and many people  
 apply for vacancies in this field.    
                                       
 Many people travel to Southampton or  
 further to their place of work. In a  
 big town such as Southampton there are
 many job opportunities because it is  
 always developing.
