		<content>  There are no industries in           
 Bromborough.The area is mostly        
 farming .There are some shops near    
 our school and a railway station on   
 the Rockferry line.                   
  We visited{Eastham Youth/Community   
{ centre}and we found out that a varity
 of activities happen there.Some people
 go to{Learning Links}to learn to get  
 a job.They learn different skills for 
 example typing,computing and first    
 aid.people also go to discos,youth    
 groups and the toddler groups.        
  We went to two farms to interview Mr 
 Cooper and Mr Ford. Together they     
 employ five people who help them on   
 their farms.                          
  We found that the majority of people 
 just live in Bromborough and work in  
 places like Liverpool and Chester.
