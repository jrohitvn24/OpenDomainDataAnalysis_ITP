		<content> One of our children interviewed Mr    
 James Henderson,the editor of our     
 local newspaper,the"Northern Times".He
 told us he had been editor for ten    
 years afer he had arrived from the    
 "Scottish Daily Express" in           
 Glasgow.When asked what was his       
 biggest story,he repliied that it was 
 the severe blizzard which hit the     
 North of Scotland in 1978,causing     
 severe damage and cutting power       
 supplies for up to nine days.Roads    
 were blocked,trains were marooned and 
 for days the only transport operating 
 were helicopters.
