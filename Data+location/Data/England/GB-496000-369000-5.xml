		<title>05BRAYFORD POOL, LINCOLN.</title>
		<content> The {Brayford }was  originally a{Roman
{inland  port}which became an important
 commercial centre throughout Lincoln's
 history. The{Fossdyke  Canal }links it
 with the {River  Trent}and  boats  can
 reach the{Wash}along the{River Witham.
 Warehouses once stored grain,cloth and
 many other goods. Railways and silting
 of the rivers have ruined the trade.  
 Now the  Brayford is used for pleasure
 boating and sports. Every year in June
 the{Lincoln Water Festival}takes place
 here,featuring water ballet,fireworks,
 raft races, quayside  events  and lots
 more. There  are  times  for  fishing,
 boating or just plain lazing about.The
 area  is  always {busy}because  of the
 waterside pubs and supermarkets.      
 Thousands  of  boats  pass through the
 pool each  year and it has  now become
 the{inland waterway centre}of the East
 Midlands.                             </content>
