		<title>11MORE ABOUT OUR VILLAGE</title>
		<content> Several years ago a fire swept from   
 one thatched roof to the next and most
 of the village cottages were damaged. 
  Some temporary prefab were built in  
 the late 1940's for use by council    
 tenants.This year the present tenants 
 had to move out whilst the            
 'temporary'houses were completely     
 refurbished.                          
  A new housing development provided   
 the school with good clay excavated   
 when concrete piles had to be sunk for
 house foundation support.This put a   
 few extra pounds cash on each house.  
  The Church dates from Anglo Saxon    
 times and is an active influence in   
 the village.The school children visit 
 ,as classes, for church events.       
  The bus service is rather sparse but 
 sufficient for school children and    
 workers on regular times.
