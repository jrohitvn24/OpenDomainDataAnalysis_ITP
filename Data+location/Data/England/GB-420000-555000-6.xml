		<title>06AN AFTERNOON AT CAUSEY.</title>
		<content> On Friday 21st June 1985 we visited   
 the area called the Causey to see for 
 ourselves the famous{Causey Arch.     
{THE CAUSEY }is a conservation area    
 where nature is allowed to flourish.  
 The old Tanfield Waggonway is now just
 a track. A Nature Warden is employed  
 by Durham County Council to patrol the
 area. There are many species of birds 
 nesting in the trees; magpies,        
 chaffinches,hawfinches,wrens and even,
 a rare bird,the crossbill.            
   There is a jagged sandstone rockface
 which is often used by climbers as a  
 practice ground. A large notice is    
 displayed which points out that the   
 rocks should not be climbed without   
 proper equipment or experience. Anyone
 climbing these rocks do so at their   
 own risk.                             
 We enjoyed this peaceful spot and the 
 dramatic grandeur of the Causey Arch. </content>
