{                                      
 Felton C of E First School is at the  
 North end of Felton Village. It was   
 built in 1973.                        
 There are 22 rooms in the school.     
 There is one central hall,4 classrooms
 and a kitchen. Each 2 classrooms share
 4 toilets,1 cloakroom and 1 craftroom.
 There is a big playing field which is 
 very boggy.When the school was built  
 they had to sink{10}huge metal tubes  
 filled with concrete to support the   
 school and the playground.            
                                       
 In 1985 we planted some hazel and     
 willow trees and we are hoping to make
 a butterfly garden there. There is a  
 playground 28m square and there are   
 tractor tyres to sit in and markings  
 for games. There is a big sand pit.
