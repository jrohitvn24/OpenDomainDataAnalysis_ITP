		<content>   The paper is delivered free, but it 
 depends on people making subscriptions
 every year. There are 1250 copies     
 produced monthly, but only 950 are    
 actually delivered. The other 300 are 
 taken to the shops and libraries. It  
 costs about Â£160 a month to produce,  
 and was chosen in 1983 as the best    
 local newspaper in Gloucestershire.   
   Here is an extract from the         
 Painswick Beacon of December 1984:    
                                       
 "PAID UP PROMISES                     
 The Painswick Tennis Club Promises    
 Auction, which took place on Saturday 
 10th November in Painswick House,     
 raised Â£1,240 in promises alone. When 
 gate money, bar and donations are     
 taken into account, overÂ£1,300 will   
 have been received, making it a most  
 successful evening - and all the      
 promises paid up! Well over 100 people</content>
