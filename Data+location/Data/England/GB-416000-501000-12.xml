		<title>12The village of Skeeby</title>
		<content> At the foot of Hall Farm drive there  
 is a barn which is being made into a  
 modern bungalow.The village hall was  
 made from two old cottages. Halfe Hill
 House was also a farm building. Rose  
 Cottage was once a granary.           
    There is only one shop and the     
 prices are rather high compared with  
 town shops.It is also the Post        
 Office.                               
    It is an attracive village with a  
 rising spring beck flowing alongside  
 the main road edge by the village     
 green.                                
    The most annoying aspect of living 
 in Skeeby is the speed and intensity  
 of the traffic at certain times of    
 day.Also the rates are very high and  
 services poor.There is a small street 
 of council houses and old peoples     
 bungalows.The houses are having their 
 foundations strengthened.             </content>
