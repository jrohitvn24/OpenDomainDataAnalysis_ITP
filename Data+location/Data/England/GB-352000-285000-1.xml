		<title>01Munslow to Tusford Lowland</title>
		<content>   The block contains undulating valley
 land around the small river Corve and 
 the Tingford and Pye brooks plus the  
 steep slopes to the Heath plateau.    
 Munslow village (population 128) still
 has its 'Hundred House', now an inn - 
 The Crown. The rest of the population 
 live in the hamlet of Tingford,       
 Bouldon &amp; Broncroft, the settlement of
 Heath &amp; Bancott plus isolated farms,  
 houses &amp; cottages. Agriculture is the 
 dominant occupation, but a substantial
 number of people commute to work      
 elsewhere. Retired persons are        
 numerous but there are few unemployed.
 Rich red soil supports pastures for   
 fattening cattle &amp; sheep. There are   
 only two modest dairy herds. However, 
 the majority of fields are cropped    
 with cereals &amp; occasionally oilseed   
 rape, peas &amp; potatoes. Blackcurrants  
 are grown at Bancott Farm.            </content>
