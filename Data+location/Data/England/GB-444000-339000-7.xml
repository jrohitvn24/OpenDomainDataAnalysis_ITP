		<title>07A Schoolboy's Day - 1985</title>
		<content> I awoke at 7.30 a.m. and got dressed  
 and washed.  By 8.29 I was in school, 
 having had my breakfast and fed my    
 rabbits.  I arranged the chairs and   
 did some project work, before our     
 school day began at 9 a.m.  The       
 morning was taken up with assembly, a 
 broadcast, play-time, maths and craft.
  I returned home for lunch, arriving  
 back at school at 12.48 p.m. and after
 play, the afternoon session was taken 
 up with nature, break and project     
 work. After school I caught an escaped
 rabbit, playing with our German       
 Student and cleaned out the hens      
 before tea, after which I fed the mice
 and played with Steven Edmonds before 
 scouts, which began at 7 p.m.  We did 
 badge work until I returned home at   
 9.30 p.m. and went to bed at 9.41 p.m.
