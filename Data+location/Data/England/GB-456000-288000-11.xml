		<title>11TRANSPORT ASHBY M PEATLING P</title>
		<content> As Ashby Magna and Peatling Parva have
 no public transport provided regularly
 most people travel by private means.  
 There are, however, two school buses  
 every weekday morning and afternoon   
 but the general public cannot use     
 them.                                 
 There is a private bus to Leicester   
 which goes through several surrounding
 villages including Ashby Magna and    
 Peatling Parva on Wednesday mornings, 
 returning early afternoon.            
 A similar service is run on Thursday  
 mornings taking passengers to the     
 market town of Lutterworth, returning 
 midday.                               
 Although there is no public transport 
 in rural villages the community       
 spirit is such that one neighbour with
 transport will always help a neighbour
 without.
