		<title>08ANOTHER TYPICAL SATURDAY</title>
		<content> Last Saturday I got up and watched    
 some television. Then I had my        
 breakfast and my dad and I went up to 
 my uncle Les to take his wheelbarrow  
 back.Then we loaded the trailer with  
 rubbish and dumped it on the farm     
 scrap heap. We had fish and chips for 
 our dinner.In the afternoon we went to
 see my mum's friend Geoff because he s
 selling us a greenhouse. When we got  
 back I had a game of football with my 
 dog. After that I had some tea, then I
 watched some television before I went 
 to bed.
