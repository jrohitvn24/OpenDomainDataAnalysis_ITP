		<title>12WOODLAND IN THE RIB VALLEY.</title>
		<content> There are several areas of woodland in
 the Rib valley. Many of these are of  
 ancient origin. For example{"Gardiners
{Spring"}near Swangles' Farm was named 
 after a local family. Today it is only
 a small wood,but it was once much     
 larger. It is inhabited by pheasants, 
 partridges,hares and rabbits,which are
 kept for shooting.{"Buckney Wood"}near
 Cold Christmas is one of the larger   
 woods. It is mainly deciduous,with a  
 narrow footpath running through the   
 middle.{"Sawtrees Wood"}near Barwick  
 ford is also deciduous and has been   
 coppiced in the past. Today it isn't  
 managed and is very overgrown,making  
 it popular for walking and picnics.   
{Dutch Elm Disease}has hit the Rib     
 valley badly. The track leading to    
 Thundridge old church (called "the    
 Causeway")used to be lined with elms, 
 but these have all been destroyed.    </content>
