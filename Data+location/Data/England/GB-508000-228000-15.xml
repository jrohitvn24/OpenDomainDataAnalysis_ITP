		<title>15Trees of the Hexton Area</title>
		<content> The most common trees are beech, ash, 
 pine and sycamore. Deciduous trees    
 predominate and we noted elder, lime, 
 apple, pear, witch elm, hornbeam,     
 blackthorn, cherry, laurel, silver    
 birch and willow. The evergreen trees 
 are pine, fir and Norwegian spruce.   
 Trees are planted and cultivated to   
 enhance the countryside and to produce
 commercial crops of firewood and      
 timber for the manufacture of         
 furniture. Forestry is particularly   
 important in squares (29,09) and      
 (29,10). Most trees grow on the steep 
 sides of hills or hilltops where it is
 difficult to plough the land for      
 cereal crops. In square (29,09) there 
 is a "Site of Special Interest". This 
 is a large clump of beech trees.      
 Nobody is allowed to fell those trees,
 or to plant more. They are left alone 
 to grow, seed and die naturally.      </content>
