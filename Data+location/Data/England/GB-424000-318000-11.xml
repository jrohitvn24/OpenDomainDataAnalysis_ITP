		<content> I wake up at seven thirty and go      
 downstairs for my breakfast.I have a  
 bowl of Frosties and a cup of coffee. 
 I then have a wash and get dressed.   
 At a quarter to nine I set of for     
 school.When I get there I play in the 
 playground for five minutes until the 
 bell goes.We have assembly for half an
 hour.Next we have an hour of          
 handwriting.At twenty to eleven we    
 have playtime.From eleven o'clock till
 twelve we all have Peak Maths, and    
 then we have dinner.I have art until  
 twenty past two, and then I have      
 playtime again.From half past two till
 half past three I have computer.Then I
 go home.When I get home I get changed 
 and watch T.V.I have my tea which is  
 usually marmite sandwitches.At half   
 eight I go to bed.
