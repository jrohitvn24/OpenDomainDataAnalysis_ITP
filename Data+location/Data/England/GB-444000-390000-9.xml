 you go in , pay the money to swim     
 which is around 33p and then you are  
 given a band with a number on it. This
 number is for your locker in which you
 keep your clothes and things. When you
 are changed and have put your clothes 
 in your locker you then put your band 
 round your ankle or wrist.In the      
 changing rooms there are              
 showers,cubicles to get changed in and
 as you walk through  to the pool there
 are toilets.There 2 seperate pools,a  
 baby pool which is quite shallow and  
 has a slide for small children and a  
 big pool which is suitable for all    
 ages.It is about 2 feet in the shallow
 end and deepens to about 6feet.There  
 is a big slide for older children and
