		<content>   Every year Bramley has a fete in the
 Summer and lots of people go there    
 to join in the games or to buy things 
 from the stalls. The money goes to    
 charity. It is held on the cricket    
 field near Gosden House School and    
 they also join in. This school is for 
 children who have difficulty in       
 learning.                             
   On the Saturday nearest to November 
 5th a firework display is put on in   
 the village in the evening. This is   
 great fun and the people who go also  
 have a baked potato.                  
   The Bramley Players are a local     
 amateur dramatic company and each year
 they put on a play.                   
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
