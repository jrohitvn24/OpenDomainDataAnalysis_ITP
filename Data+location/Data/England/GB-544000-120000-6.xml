		<title>06UCKFIELD'S INDUSTRY 1.</title>
		<content>   Over the past few years there have  
 been many{changes}in Uckfield's       
 industrial scene. The main factory    
 complex is situated just off the      
 southern end of the High Street,      
 access being via the A.22(High Street)
 until the{by-pass}completion towards  
 the end of 1985.It will then be served
 by a direct link road from the        
 by-pass, providing welcome relief from
 industrial traffic. Little use is made
 of the rail link especially as there  
 is no track south of Uckfield. The    
 site is level and extends almost to   
 the by-pass. At the time of writing   
 there are a number of new factory     
 buildings ready for occupation and a  
 number of plots still vacant.To the   
 north of{Bell Brook Industrial Estate 
 runs an earth rampart to be grassed   
 and planted with trees as a visual and
 noise barrier for Rocks Park Estate.  </content>
