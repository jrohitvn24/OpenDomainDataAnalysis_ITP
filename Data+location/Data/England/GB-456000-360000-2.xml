		<content>      The band goes out on weekends but
 mainly on Sundays because most of the 
 children have other things to do on   
 Saturdays. The main Gala is the       
 Federation Gala. This is a competition
 to tell whether they are overall band 
 of the year or not.                   
      We get trophies and medals if we 
 win. There are individual medals and  
 full band medals. We have a sash to   
 sew them on. You can  buy medals on a 
 trophy stall.                         
      Many children in this area have  
 had great pleasure being in the       
 Coronets and have found it quite      
 interesting.
