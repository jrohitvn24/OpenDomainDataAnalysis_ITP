		<title>01SOUTHBOROUGH AND AREA</title>
		<content> {Southborough} is surrounded by the   
open country of the High Weald and     
straddles the A26. The traffic on this 
road, 20,000 cars a day, dominates the 
town. There are 65 hectares of housing 
on each side of the A26. 95% of the    
shops and offices are spread along this
road in two main groups. Corner shops  
are found throughout the area. Most of 
the services for the area are provided 
by {Tonbridge} and {Tunbridge Wells.}  
 Southborough is surrounded by small   
hamlets: Modest Corner, Nonsuch Green  
and Great Bounds. To the east is High  
Brooms, an area that reflects the      
rapid growth of brick and tile         
manufacturing in the late C19th.       
Bidborough to the north-west is a      
commuter village with much high-value  
housing. Southborough is a dormitory   
town with a population that commutes   
locally and to {London.}               </content>
