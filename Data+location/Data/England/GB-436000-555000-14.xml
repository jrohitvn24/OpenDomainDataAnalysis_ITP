 by a small number of large employers  
 in heavy industry:shipbuilding,coal   
 mining and engineering.Their decline  
 in recent years has led to high levels
 of unemployment.This year unemployment
 is running at 22% whilst the national 
 average is 14%.In Sunderland 27% of   
 males are unemployed and long term    
 unemployment is a serious problem.

 only 25% get permanent jobs.The       
 remainder go on Y.T.S.Schemes.There
