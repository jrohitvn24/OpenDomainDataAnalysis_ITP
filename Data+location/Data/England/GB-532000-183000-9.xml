   The Community Education Trust is an 
organisation which started an anti-    
racist course in Islington amongst many
third years in Islington schools.Opel  
Christie (co-ordinator) visted schools 
telling third years about the years    
course.We now meet regulary and discuss
the problems of racism.The years course
included a three week trip to Barbados 
for three winners of an anti-racist    
essay competition.I was one of the     
lucky three.                           
   In July we flew out from Heathrow   
and spent three weeks staying with     
families.We were taken round the island
visiting schools and many other places 
of interest to help give us an idea of 
their way of life.As well as being an  
enjoyable experience it certainly help 
me to understand other peoples'views   
and problems.                          </content>
