		<title>12BULLDOGS CHARGE</title>
		<content> Bulldogs is an easy game. The rules   
 are: someone stands in the middle of  
 the road and says either "Bulldogs    
 charge!", "Bulldogs hop!", "Bulldogs  
 skip!", "Bulldogs hop, skip and       
 jump!", or "Bulldogs jump!". There can
 be as many as 40 players. The person  
 in the middle says one of the things  
 and you have to do it. If you get     
 across safely, you are not on. If you 
 get tugged, you are on.               
      This keeps on going until you    
 have all had a turn at being on, and  
 then you dip to see who is on next    
 game.                                 
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
