		<title>13Overton &amp; Fyfield Cottages.</title>
		<content> A number of local cottages have       
 thatched roofs. They should last for  
 over twenty years, possibly up to a   
 hundred years. Work on the thatches is
 carried out by a local thatcher from  
 Lacock. The residents of the cottages 
 like the pretty appearance of the     
 thatched roofs above all else. They   
 enjoy living in the pleasant          
 countryside. The cottages date from   
 the 16th and 17th centuries. They are 
 built largely from sarsen stone       
 foundations, flint and chalk.         
 Some cottages are not thatched.       
 One cottage is over 200 years old. The
 lady has lived there since she was    
 seven. The house was haunted when she 
 moved in. She keeps three canaries,   
 two dogs and a cat.
