		<content> Although there is no football ground  
 for spectating in the square, there is
 a training ground for Crystal Palace  
 Football Club.                        
 There is a running track at Tweeddale 
 Road which was opened in 1958 by the  
 Duke of Edinburgh.A world class       
 athlete, Gordon Pirie,was the first   
 person to run on it.Many local schools
 use the track and the other facilities
 for athletics training and meetings.  
 For those who like to go at a slower  
 pace, there are numerous parks where  
 people can stroll and young children  
 amuse themselves e.g. Poulter's Park, 
 Ravensbury Park and Morden Park where 
 there is also a small golf course.    
  Middleton Circle Library can supply  
 tapes, posters, cassettes, pictures,  
 records as well as books!There is also
 a computer to play on during the      
 school holidays.                      </content>
