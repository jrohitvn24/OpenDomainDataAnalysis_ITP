		<title>19Rural recreation</title>
		<content> There are no public playing fields or 
 sports centres in the area, and most  
 people who wish to play games such as 
 football, tennis, or squash, or who   
 wish to swim, have to travel to the   
 nearby towns.  Some families, however,
 have their own swimming pools and     
 tennis courts. Most people find their 
 recreation in or near their homes in  
 activities such as shooting,          
 gardening, needlework, and knitting.  
 Some people have taken up painting and
 learning to play the organ.  At only  
 one place was it stated there was no  
 time for recreation.  Two fox hunts,  
 North Hereford and Clifton on Teme,   
 operate across this block, many people
 following on horseback, others on foot
 as far as they are able.  Local       
 children are able to join scouts and  
 guides in Bromyard. There is a mobile 
 library and a larger one in Bromyard. </content>
