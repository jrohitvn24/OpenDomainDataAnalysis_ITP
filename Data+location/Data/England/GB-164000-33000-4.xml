		<content> The school was built in 1896. The     
 school has a playground either        
 side of it. It has two flower         
 gardens and two vegetable gardens.    
 It has a field for playing in and     
 for football and cricket. It has      
 two climbing frames, a big one and    
 a little one. The playground has      
 just been resurfaced and most of      
 the trees had to be cut down          
 because of{Dutch Elm disease.}There   
 is a caravan with office and          
 library where the headteacher and     
 secretary both work. In the school    
 building there are three classrooms,  
 two cloakrooms, one hall and one      
 canteen. There are three full time    
 teachers and one part-time. There     
 are{seventy children}who come to      
 school. Most of the children come     
 from Praze. Some come from Crowan     
 others from Black Rock and Tremayne.  </content>
