		<content> Temple Balsall belonged to the Knights
 Templars as early as 1146.There was   
 probably a chapel on the site then.By 
 1338 the Knights of St John were      
 living there .They left in the        
 1470s,and the church was allowed  to  
 decay for more than 100 years.        
 Eventually the manor was owned by     
 Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester.His  
 grandaughters,Lady Anne Holbourne and 
 Lady Katherine Leveson began to       
 restore the church.Lady Katherine also
 left money to set up an almshouse and 
 school.The minister was also Master of
 the Hospital and teacher of the boys.A
 second restoration took place in 1845.
 St Mary's Church was made a parish    
 church in 1863.
