		<title>11THE KENNET CENTRE</title>
		<content> The Kennet centre is a pedestrian     
 shopping precinct, opened in 1985     
 with shops such as a bakery,          
 supermarket and linen store.          
                                       
 It is locked at night and in the      
 morning it is opened and guarded by   
 security guards in case of vandalism. 
 If you are lucky you might see a brass
 band playing or a display of racing   
 cars, clockwork puppets or double     
 glazing.                              
                                       
 The surrouding area is very nice.It   
 has a bakery as well as a fishmonger  
 and cheese shop which also sells      
 raisins and peanuts.
