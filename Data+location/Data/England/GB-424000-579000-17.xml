		<title>17Policing the Area</title>
		<content> Bedlington comes under the Wansbeck   
 subdivision of Northumbria Police. The
 Police station is now closed after    
 4.30pm. A policy is being implemented 
 whereby soon there will be a balance  
 between the number of patrol cars and 
 the number of men on the beat. When   
 surplus officers are available, the   
 Front Street is patrolled on foot, and
 cars cover the rest of the area. Extra
 police are used at certain times - eg.
 at Lucy's Night Club at weekends. The 
 public are very law-abiding, and      
 relations are good even in the wake of
 the Miners' strike. Crime has         
 increased - most crime is committed by
 children and youths. The detection    
 rate has gone up by 48%. There is a   
 spate of car thefts and some solvent  
 abuse. Police warn people to leave no 
 signs that they are out. Police       
 establish links with schools.         </content>
