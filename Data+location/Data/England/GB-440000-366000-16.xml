		<title>16LIVESTOCK KEPT AT GRASSMOOR.</title>
		<content> The allotments at Grassmoor are used  
 to house a variety of livestock. Some 
 men keep pigeons which are for racing.
 One man was racing his pigeons all the
 way from France. One man has a few    
 geese and some goslings. Quite a lot  
 of people kept hens to provide fresh  
 eggs. Some of them breed their own    
 chickens.                             
 There is a large aviary on the        
 allotment made from a garden shed with
 a covered flight pen at the side. Most
 of the birds kept are zebra finches   
 and goldfinches. The others were      
 cockateels, one of which was breeding.
 The allotments are also popular with  
 wild birds which find a large supply  
 of food readily available.            
 There are plenty of taps provided to  
 supply water for the plants and       
 animals, including an old goat which  
 is tethered on one plot  of land.     </content>
