		<title>03Family life at weekends</title>
		<content> Most weekends me and my brother go    
 swimming with my dad.When I get home I
 have a drink of coffee some           
 times.I go out on my{BMX 2000 bike    
 with Neil and  Richard in the swing   
 park.When they have to go in I play   
 with the football with my brother.Then
 my mum calls me in for dinner. After I
 have had  my dinner I help do the     
 garden. Dad lets me put stones in the 
 dustbin.                              
  It is very sad when people leave.    
{My friend called Julie}was very nice  
 and at Christmas when I was a 2nd year
 she left because her dad was in the   
 army. He got an army posting which    
 meant he had to go to Hong Kong. I    
 did'nt want her to leave as she was my
 best friend. I was very sad when she  
 left but we still like to write to    
 each other.
