		<content> A DAY IN THE LIFE OF MICHAEL ROSENHEAD
                                       
    The religion of my family is       
 Judaism. We believe in only one god.  
 We have many festivals including      
 Pesach, Succot, Shevuot, Lag ta Omer, 
 Rosh Hashana, Chanuka and Purim. We   
 also have a special day every week    
 which is called{SHABBAT.              
    This is a day of rest. We rest on  
 this day because it took God 6 days to
 create the world and on the 7th He    
 rested. He named this day Shabbat.    
    On Friday night we light candles   
 and say a blessing when it is dark to 
 bring in Shabbat. On Saturday morning 
 we go to synagogue to pray. After, we 
 have a kiddush (wine and snacks). In  
 the afternoon we read a book or rest  
 in the garden. We are not allowed to  
 drive, cook, watch tv or play records.
