		<content> Farmhouses and cottages on the        
 Leconfield Estate, west of the main   
 road, have tenant occupiers and are   
 old properties. Gownfold farmhouse is 
 partly 14th century. The houses are   
 maintained by the Estate. Among the   
 trees and bracken on Brickkiln Common,
 new detached houses, privately owned, 
 are chamging the character of that    
 part of the area. Bulchins Farm is a  
 very old house. In the 18th century it
 was the 'Royal Oak', on a main road   
 from London to Littlehampton. The     
 kitchen is now being enlarged. Medhone
 and Shipbourne farmhouses are no more.
 Medhone has been destroyed as no      
 longer required, and Shipbourne       
 Farmhouse was burned to the ground.   
 Omly a farm cottage remains, reached  
 by a gravel track in a bad state of   
 repair. The tenant's hobby is growing 
 old English roses.                    </content>
