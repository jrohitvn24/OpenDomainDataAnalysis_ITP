		<content>     The River Leam runs from the North
 East corner to the South West corner  
 of the survey area.The River Itchen   
 runs North Easterly from the South    
 West.                                 
    The river Leam runs through{       
{Eathorpe.Wappenbury}and{Hunningham.   
 The water shed separates the two      
 rivers going North East to the South  
 West and rises to 100m.The two main   
 roads are the B4453 which connects    
{Leamington }and {Rugby }and runs      
 through {Weston Under Wetherley}and   
 the Fosse Way,the B4029 through       
{Hunningham}and {Eathorpe}.The Fosse   
 Way is a Roman Road and runs from     
{Lincoln} to {Seaton }in Devon.The four
 small villages are in undulating      
 countryside with farms.There are no   
 schools at the villages so the        
 children have to go to Cubbington     
 school by bus.                        </content>
