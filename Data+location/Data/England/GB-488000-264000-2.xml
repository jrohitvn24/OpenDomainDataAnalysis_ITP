The farming in this area is mainly     
arable undertaken by farmers on their  
own land, although 17 per cent is      
undertaken by tenant farmers. The crops
are wheat, barley and oil seed rape    
with some root crops grown to feed the 
sheep which graze on the rough pasture 
particularly in the Nene Valley. In the
past few years many hedgerows have been
uprooted to make bigger fields to      
enable bigger farm machines to carry   
out the harvesting. After harvest, in  
the past few years a pall of thick     
smoke has hung over the area as the    
stubble has been burned off. There is  
no dairy farming in the area. The      
farmers now working the land have      
descended from farming families who    
have worked the land here for          
generations.
