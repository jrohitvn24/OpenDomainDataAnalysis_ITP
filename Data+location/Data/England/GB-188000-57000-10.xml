		<title>10Caravans and Houses.</title>
		<content> The residential caravan site at Higher
 Fraddon is called Pedna Carne.Families
 are housed there by Restormel District
 Council until there is a council house
 or flat available..                   
 There is a large council estate called
 the Carworgie Estate off St.Francis   
 Road.Houses along the main roads are  
 older,having mostly been built before 
 or between the two World Wars.Other   
 more modern private housing has been  
 built together in estates in fields   
 set back from the main roads.These    
 estates are of bungalows,not houses.  
 The Kelliers is land behind the old   
 school on the A30 which was once a    
 beauty spot.For many years caravan    
 dwellers have lived there as squatters
 and have made the place into a mess.  
 Now(1985) Restormel Council are trying
 to buy the Kelliers and clear it.
