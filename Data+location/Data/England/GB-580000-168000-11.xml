		<title>11  Salt marsh deposits</title>
		<content>The parts of the marsh above the high  
water mark are composed of silty clay  
deposited by the river. This has       
hardened as it has dried and is now    
quite firm.It has oxidised to a dark   
reddish colour.The sides of the large  
channels are composed of fine mud,the  
surface of which has oxidised to a     
light brown colour.When disturbed      
this reveals the deep black colour     
typical of the oxygen scarce reducing  
conditions of marsh deposits.The       
floors of these large channels are     
disected by meandering micro-channels. 
The type of deposition in these        
obviously varies with the state of     
the tidal regime. At low tide the      
top 3 to 4 cms consist of very fine    
oily black mud probably deposited at   
low velocity by the last water in the  
channel.However beneath the mud are pea
size grits deposited by faster flows.  </content>
