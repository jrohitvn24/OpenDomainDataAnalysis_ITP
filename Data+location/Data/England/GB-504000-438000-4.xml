		<title>04Shopping survey in Beverley</title>
		<content> We went to the shops to conduct a     
 shopping survey for one day.  Most    
 people said, "Once a day" to          
 the question, "How often do you use   
 these shops?" One person said twice a 
 day. Then we asked them how long they 
 had lived in the area. It seemed quite
 a settled area, because out of fifty  
 people interviewed only one person had
 lived there for under five years. Five
 people had lived there for over fifty 
 years.  Then we asked people why they 
 used the shops?  Most people said they
 were convenient.  Nearly everyone     
 said that they liked shopping there.  
 We asked them how often they visited  
 the market and most people said every 
 week.  Just about everyone said the   
 prices were a bit expensive. Not many 
 people said that they wanted to see   
 more shops in the area.
