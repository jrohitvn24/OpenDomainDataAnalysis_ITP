		<content> Many homes have modern labour saving  
 appliances such as washing machines,  
 refrigerators, deep freezes, electric 
 cookers and dish washers.  Other      
 additions to home life such as        
 telephones, televisions, music        
 centres, and videos are also in       
 increasing use.  Most homes have a    
 garden under cultivation, many of     
 these grow vegetables for home        
 consumption. Other country cooking    
 skills such as preserving, wine       
 making, etc., are still practised.    
 The hobbies carried out by the        
 villagers are many and varied;        
 including painting, embroidery,       
 dressmaking, photography and          
 beekeeping.  Many homes have domestic 
 pets.
