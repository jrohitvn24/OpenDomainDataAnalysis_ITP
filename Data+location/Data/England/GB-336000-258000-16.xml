		<content> As regards the Parish Council         
 elections there have not been any for 
 some years:in Local District and      
 County Council elections voters tend  
 to vote for the personality rather    
 than the party, but in Parliamentary  
 elections most voters made up their   
 minds long before the election.The    
 majority vote Conservative with the   
 Liberals a good second,but other      
 parties only have a few votes.But most
 candidates would be advised           
 ,especially Parliamentary, not to ask 
 prospective voters what their politics
 are as some people regard their       
 politics like a womans age,a secret.
