		<content>   The area is gently undulating,      
 crossed by two rivers and a brook,    
 flowing from north-west to south-east.
  The land on either side of these     
 rivers is subject to flooding.  The   
 rivers are well-stocked with fish,    
 including trout, perch and eels.      
 Bulrushes and kingcups are to be found
 on the banks.                         
   There are well-established          
 hedgerows, providing a natural habitat
 for local wildlife.  Rabbits, moles,  
 grey squirrels, hedgehogs and foxes   
 are all very common to the area.      
 Badger setts are also to be found.    
   Many wild flowers such as cowslips, 
 primroses and bluebells are now       
 re-establishing themselves since      
 spraying of hedgerows has virtually   
 ceased. The map shows several foot-   
 paths, but some are now ploughed up or
 have crops sown over them.            </content>
