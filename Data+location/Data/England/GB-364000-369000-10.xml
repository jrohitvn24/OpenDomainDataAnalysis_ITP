		<title>10Davenham Village Policeman</title>
		<content> Our village policeman keeps law and   
 order in our village. He starts his   
 round at 8.00am and finishes at 2.00am
 the next morning. His duties vary     
 every day. He may be on patrol one day
 and have to do paperwork the next day.
 The area he covers is from the bottom 
 of London Road in Northwich, Leftwich 
 and Davenham. On patrol he goes around
 in uniform and the only equipment he  
 carries are a truncheon, handcuffs and
 a walkie-talkie. The most common      
 crimes are shoplifting, damages and   
 breaking into people's homes. In the  
 area he covers he arrests more        
 teenagers than adults. He mainly      
 arrests them for drunkenness,         
 shoplifting and minor damages. He has 
 been to a few real emergencies such as
 old people collapsing, house-fires,   
 road accidents. The good thing he sees
 in the village is tidiness.           </content>
