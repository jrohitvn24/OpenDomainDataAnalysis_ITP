		<content>THERE ARE MANY WAYS OF TRAVELLING FROM 
LOWERHOUSE AND ROSEGROVE TO OTHER      
PLACES.                                
THE LEEDS AND LIVERPOOL CANAL PASSES   
CLOSE TO OUR SCHOOL AND WE OFTEN SEE   
BARGES MOVING SLOWLY ALONG.  FACTORIES 
WERE BUILT ALONG THE SIDES OF THE CANAL
SO THAT THEIR FINISHED PRODUCTS COULD  
EASILY BE TRANSPORTED.                 
THE NEW M65 MOTORWAY,OPENED 1982, NOW  
RUNS FROM NELSON TO BLACKBURN. MANY    
HOUSES WERE DEMOLISHED WHERE IT RUNS   
PARALLEL TO THE RAILWAY IN ROSEGROVE.  
ROSEGROVE RAILWAY STATION HAS NO       
TICKET OFFICE OR WAITING ROOM, YOU PAY 
WHEN YOU BOARD THE TRAIN. TRAINS RUN TO
COLNE OR PRESTON.                      
MANY PRIVATE VEHICLES TRAVEL PAST THE  
SCHOOL AND THEY CAN BUY PETROL AT      
THE LOCAL FILLING STATION FOR TWO      
POUNDS A GALLON.
