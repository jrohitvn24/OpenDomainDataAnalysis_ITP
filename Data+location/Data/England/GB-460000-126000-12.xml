		<content> There is a play group for the under   
 fives at Cheriton, a village 2 miles  
 to the west.  There are other nursery 
 education facilities within 5 miles.  
 Hinton Ampner primary school lies     
 within the area; it places great      
 emphasis on a family atmosphere for   
 children between the ages of 5 and 11.
 The school was closed in 1985, the    
 children being sent to Cheriton       
 School.   The nearest school for      
 children between 11 and 16 is the     
 Community School in Alresford.  For   
 those wishing to continue full time   
 education there is a 6th Form College 
 in Winchester.  Transport is provided 
 for all children between 5 and 18.    
 Adult education facilities are        
 available at the Community School.    
 There  is a Krishnamurti Foundation   
 and residential school for adults.
