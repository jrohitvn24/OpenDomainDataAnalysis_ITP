		<content> When I get home I play with my Lego   
 sets. I enjoy playing with them       
 because you can make lots of different
 models. My favourite model is the     
 police station. Lego comes in         
 different groups for different ages,  
 starting with Duplo for 0 to 4 years. 
 The most advanced Lego is Technical   
 Lego for 10 to 14 years. But I enjoy  
 technical sets which are meant for    
 older ages, even though my dad has to 
 do some of it.                        
 In the playground I play Sticky Glue  
 with my friends. The person who is it 
 tries to get another person. If       
 another person gets touched they stand
 with their arms out wide and a person 
 has to go under their arms to make    
 them free again.                      
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
