		<title>18GOVERNMENT- TOWN DEVELOPMENT</title>
		<content> The Northleach Town Council has put   
 forward a draft plan for the          
 development of Northleach, their main 
 aims being to encourage expansion in  
 the number of homes, shops and small  
 businesses in order to attract fresh  
 young faces to the town. Their plan is
 in three phases. The first including  
 general improvements such as widening 
 "Forty Road", dredging the Leach and  
 campaigning for better policing.      
 Northleach residents are also very    
 involved in the battle for the        
 retention of Westwood's Grammar       
 School. The second aim is to increase 
 light industry based on the Coalyard  
 Farm development. The third phase is  
 in improving the Tourist facilities-  
 including new parking areas and the   
 introduction of a special             
 picnic/recreation area alongside the  
 river.                                </content>
