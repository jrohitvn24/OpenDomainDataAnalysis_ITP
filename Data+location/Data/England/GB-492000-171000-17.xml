		<title>17THE OFFICE COMPLEX</title>
		<content>  The office complex is modern but     
 blends in well with the surrounding   
 Victorian buildings.  The inside is   
 very well planned with rooms leading  
 into each other.  Space is provided   
 for hundreds of files and many large  
 maps.                                 
  This office controls 15,000 acres of 
 farmland, gardens, parkland and       
 forest, there are 300 employees to    
 look after it.                        
  Modern technology plays a big part in
 the office.  All the accounts are kept
 on a single computer but secretaries  
 are still needed for answering letters
 and attending to general business.    
 The office can keep in touch with the 
 Park Wardens and farm laboures using a
 radio link up.  This saves time and   
 energy and helps the smooth running of
 the day.
