		<title>09EVENTS ON ST.MARTINS,I.O.S.</title>
		<content>   Most of the functions are held in   
 the island hall called the Reading    
 Room,for example Country              
 Dances,Discos,Whist Drives,Fancy Dress
 Parties and fund raising activities.  
 The Reading Room is being extended in 
 1985,it is having toilets and a       
 kitchen built on.The island men are   
 building the extension,we had to      
 raise some of the money ourselves.    
 Lord Vinson came and laid the         
 foundation stone on May I4th          
 I985,as he is the Chairman of the     
 Development Commision who gave a grant
 towards the improvements.It is hoped  
 that as the Reading Room is being     
 improved,it will be used more         
 regularly.The present building was    
 erected in I933,and has the crest of  
 the Prince of Wales Feathers above the
 door.The only competitive game played 
 is cricket,islanders versus visitors. </content>
