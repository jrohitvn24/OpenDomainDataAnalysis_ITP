		<title>10Arts and crafts in Langho</title>
		<content>    The art and craft work in the area 
mainly consists of (1) Evening classes 
run by Lancashire Adult Education ,    
with classes for painting in oils or   
watercolours , and craft classes in    
pewter or copper metal work , pottery  
painting and flower arranging - always 
popular courses . (2) Classes organised
by the W.I. , which are on a very      
varied scale of craft work run as      
beginners classes to create interest , 
so that members can go on to do more   
advanced work . (3) Craft work in the  
junior schools is still a very popular 
subject . Craft exhibitions are        
occasionly held in Sailsbury village so
that craft workers both from the area  
and outsiders can exhibit and sell     
their work . There are no craft shops  
in the area .
