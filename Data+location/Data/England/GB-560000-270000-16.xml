		<title>16THE KINGS PATH CONT.</title>
		<content> it was barley by the little whiskers  
 on each piece. Soon after that we     
 stopped for lunch. After a pleasant   
 dinner we started to walk back. On the
 way back we saw the{warden of         
{Chippenham Fen,}and he gave us a short
 talk about the nature reserve. I saw a
 lot of flowers there, including white 
 campions, dog roses, yellow iriss',   
 marsh orchids, silverweed and         
 forget-me-nots. The Kings Path is a   
 very interesting walk and is named    
 after{King Charles II.}This is because
 once or twice the King would go hare  
 coursing down by the path. If you want
 to walk down the Kings Path it is best
 to take an adult with you. In some    
 places you need a{permit}to walk there
 in case you pick any flowers or scare 
 any birds that may be breeding, but   
 altogether it is a very nice walk.
