		<title>12THE ORIGIN OF PLACE NAMES</title>
		<content> To many people Bishop's Tawton is just
 a straggling long village on the road 
 from Barnstaple to Exeter. Its Saxon  
 name denotes "the tun on the Taw", a  
 stockaded farm which stretched from   
 the old Exeter trackway down to the   
 river. It nestles at the foot of      
 Codden Hill which was the scene more  
 than thirteen hundred years ago for   
 the arrival of Christian missionaries 
 who sailed up the Taw in their frail  
 craft. One of them, a monk named Kea  
 from Glastonbury gave his name to     
 Landkey (the llan, or church, of Kea) 
 which became a chapelry of the parish 
 of Bishop's Tawton.
