There are only two shops in our area,  
both in Lewknor. One is                
a general store selling groceries,     
stationary, sweets and cigarettes,and  
garden accessories,as well as being the
Post Office. It has a good regular     
trade because it is the only local     
shop. In 1984 it was extended but it is
now going to be sold, so we are not    
sure what will happen.                 
The other shop is a specialist shop    
for agricultural machinery. Farrels    
draws its trade from a very wide area. 
It must do a lot of business because   
they have five computers!
