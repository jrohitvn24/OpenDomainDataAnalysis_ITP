		<content> Cross the stile,walking alongside the 
 wall on your left,pass through the    
 first gate and immediately turn       
 right.Go through another gate next to 
 the first one,onto a rough track.About
 0.3 miles along there is a stone stile
 in the wall to your right;cross over  
 and follow another stone wall which   
 runs slightly downhill at right       
 angles,{S.S.E.}to the end of the      
 field.                                
  Here a stone stile leads you out onto
 a rough track;turn left and in a few  
 metres pass through a {red gate}on    
 right and continue in a {S.S.E.}      
 direction.Cross a wire fence and go on
 until you reach the corner of the     
 field and the old railway track.Pass  
 through two old railway concrete      
 stiles and walk downhill until you    
 arrive at a stream,over which there is
 a small white bridge.                 </content>
