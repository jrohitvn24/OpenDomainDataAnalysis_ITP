		<content> Average number of communicants on     
 Sunday is 5.4% increasing to 18% at   
 major festivals. 76% of church        
 attenders are over 60 years of age.   
 However there is much Christian       
 activity in Sunday Schools, youth     
 clubs and the local school.           
 Parishes are now grouped together in  
 the Trunch Group sharing resources and
 fellowship. Eachparish still has a    
 Sunday service. The Group is served by
 three team vicars, readers (trained   
 laity) and retired clergy. Combined   
 services occasionally held by         
 Anglicans and Methodists. Alternative 
 Service Book used in most Anglican    
 services resulting in greater congreg-
 ation participation. Less formal ser- 
 vices including liturgical dancing &amp;  
 drama held occasionally. Followers of 
 other persuations have to leave the   
 village for services.                 </content>
