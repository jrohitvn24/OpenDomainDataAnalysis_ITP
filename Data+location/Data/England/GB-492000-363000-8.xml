		<title>08NORTH HYKEHAM LIBRARY</title>
		<content>  North Hykeham library has about      
 5210 members which are a mixture of   
 youny childen and adults. The libary  
 encourages people to use the library  
 by giving talks in schools to the     
 children. The Library first opened in 
 1969 and was extended in 1984. Before 
 this a back room of the Church Hall   
 was used.                             
  The library was paid for by the      
 County Council. This money comes from 
 the rates that our parents have to    
 pay. The Council employ six people to 
 run the library.                      
  The library is much better now that  
 it has been extended and refurnished, 
 making it an attractive building. It  
 is also conveniently situated in the  
 old village part of the town. Some    
 people think it should have been built
 nearer to the centre of the town.
