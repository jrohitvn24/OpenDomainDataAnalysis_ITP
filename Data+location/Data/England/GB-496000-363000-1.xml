		<title>01WADDINGTON-A DIVIDED VILLAGE</title>
		<content>   When many Lincolnshire people think 
 of Waddington they think only of the  
 village that lies on the limestone    
 ridge to the south of Lincoln. Another
 major section of the parish, however, 
 lies to the west at the foot of the   
 ridge in the lowfields of the River   
 Witham. This division is so marked    
 that most people in lower Waddington  
 consider themselves to be from Lincoln
 rather than from Waddington.          
   There have been many initiatives to 
 build closer links between the two    
 wards, particularly by organisations  
 in upper Waddington, but the          
 differences persist. Lower Waddington 
 consists mainly of modern bungalow    
 estates with a high proportion of     
 young families. Upper Waddington has  
 the old stone-built village together  
 with more recent housing and a greater
 proportion of retired people.         </content>
