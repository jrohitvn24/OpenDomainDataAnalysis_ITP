		<title>07MODERN USES OF MILLS (1)</title>
		<content>  In the second half of the eighteenth 
 century and the early years of the    
 present century,many textile mills    
 were built in this area.Some of these 
 mills are still in use today,though in
 most cases they have been adapted to  
 meet modern requirements.             
  Spur Mill,situated at the corner of  
 Greg Street and Broadstone Hall Road  
 South, was erected in 1919,and since  
 that time has continued to be the site
 of wool,fabrics and textile           
 production.                           
  On the other hand,Lancashire Hill    
 Mill, situated just to the east of    
 Manchester Road near to the           
 Lancashire Hill roundabout, is no     
 longer used for its original purpose. 
 The main part of the old mill is now  
 used as a packaging depot, and the    
 adjoining buildings have been turned  
 into small workshops.                 </content>
