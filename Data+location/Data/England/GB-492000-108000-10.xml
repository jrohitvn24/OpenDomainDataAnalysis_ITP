		<title>10Nore Hill Folly _Slindon.</title>
		<content> Nore Hill Folly was built in the      
 Nineteenth century by Lady Newburgh,  
 the Lady of the Manor from Slindon    
 House. It is a strange building almost
 on the top of Nore Hill, looking a bit
 like part of a ruined castle from the 
 distance. On closer inspection this   
 can be seen to be a false impression. 
 It is sited on the side of a wooded   
 hill with beautiful views in three    
 directions.                           
 Lady Newburgh used this folly as a    
 picnic place. You can imagine the     
 butler and staff being sent off up the
 hill with picnic baskets,tables and   
 chairs and setting it out so that Lady
 N.and her guests could enjoy a        
 leisurly stroll or horse ride up the  
 hill to enjoy an alfresco lunch!      
 Nowadays the Folly is owned and       
 maintained by the National Trust,but  
 no one uses it for picnics any more.  </content>
