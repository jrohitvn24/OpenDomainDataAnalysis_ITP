		<title>11A day in school, Bridlington</title>
		<content>  If it is Monday, Tuesday or Thursday 
 we go to assembly after registration, 
 otherwise we have a form period. At   
 9:20am we go to lessons, there are two
 lessons to begin with then a twenty   
 minute break and then two more. We    
 just sit and talk at break.           
  If I go home for dinner I make myself
 a quick snack and watch TV. Sometimes 
 I stay at school for lunch. After the 
 afternoon lessons we go home. I walk  
 so far with my friends then the rest  
 of the way by myself. When I get home 
 I usually throw my bag and coat down, 
 find something to eat and just        
 literally lounge about. Around 4:45pm 
 I go to my room, put the radio on full
 blast and{attempt}my homework. At 5:10
 pm I change or get a shower and after 
 tea get ready to go out. I usually get
 in from town at about 9:30pm. I watch 
 TV.  (Written by Jackie Warneford)    </content>
