		<content> When the church was first built it was
 probably long and narrow,and wold have
 been without an aisle.                
 In the thirteenth century the nave was
 rebuilt,a north aisle was added and   
 the chancel was extended towards the  
 east.                                 
 One interesting feature remains in the
 eastern arm rest of the sedile(seat   
 for the priest).Two windows were      
 inserted in the eastern end but the   
 small pointed oval light windows above
 them are certainly Victorian.         
 In 1602 it was reported that the body 
 of the church and the chancel was in  
 need of repair but there is no        
 evidence of any structural work having
 been carried out in the seventeeth    
 century.In fact in 1776 the tower fell
 down and a new one,with a circular    
 west window was not biult until 1840.
