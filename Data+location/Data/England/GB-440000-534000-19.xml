		<title>19A DAY IN THE LIFE OF NATALIE</title>
		<content> I woke up to the sound of running     
 water. I got up,washed,dressed and    
 tidied my room and bed. Downstairs I  
 went and had cornflakes for breakfast 
 and then back upstairs to clean my    
 teeth, brush my hair,collect my coat  
 and bag for school. Then into the car 
 for the journey to school. At school  
 the usual kind of day_ assembly,maths 
 and mental test, playtimes etc. For   
 dinner it was meat,cabbage,potatoes   
 and gravy, custard and pie.Afternoon  
 school over and I changed into my     
 jeans,shirt and jumper.A short time   
 playing then it was tea time which was
 a sandwich,crisps,a drink and an ice  
 pop.After tea I played with Rachel    
 Gibbs and Clair Adams.At 7.30pm I     
 helped Rachel bath her baby sisters   
 and put them to bed.We then played in 
 my house till almost bedtime.I watched
 television and then I went to bed.    </content>
