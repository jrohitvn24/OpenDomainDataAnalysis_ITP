		<content> The two villages of Hothfield &amp;       
 Westwell are divided by the A20;the   
 minor roads forming a web whose       
 strands either lead to &amp; from the A20 
 or parallel to it.Both villages lie on
 the north eastern edge of the Weald of
 Kent just under the North Downs       
 which are part of a range of chalk    
 hills.                                
 Westwell is tucked very close to      
 their steep scarp slope at the eastern
 end of the block.                     
 Hothfield is at the western end &amp; lies
 mainly on a bed of Lower Greensands   
 known as Folkestone Beds &amp; Sandgate   
 Beds which form the profile of        
 Hothfield Common with its peat bog.   
 The basic orientation of the valleys  
 within the block is roughly east to   
 west with springs &amp; streams leading to
 the River Stour just off the western  
 end of the block.                     </content>
