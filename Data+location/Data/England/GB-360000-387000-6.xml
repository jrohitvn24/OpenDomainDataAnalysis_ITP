		<content>{The Wire Industry In Warrington       
{   }Many people in other parts of     
 England know Warrington for its rugby 
 league team, whose nickname is The    
 Wires. This name derives from the wire
 industry, which today is based in the 
 firms of Rylands and Longford.        
    Longford was founded in 1874 and   
 now employs a workforce of about 80.  
 The firm produces its wire from metal 
 rods which are imported from countries
 such as Spain, Portugal, Germany and  
 Czechoslovakia. They make various     
 kinds of wire, including spring wire, 
 rope wire, cable, reinforcing wire and
 rivet wire. The wire costs between    
 Â£200 and Â£800 per 1000 kilos. Longford
 export the wire to America, Canada and
 Southern Ireland but most is sold in  
 Britain. It is surprising that there  
 are no exports to Europe.
