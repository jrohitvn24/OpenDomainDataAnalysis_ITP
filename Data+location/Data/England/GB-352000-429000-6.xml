		<title>06AT THE MOSQUE IN PRESTON</title>
		<content>     I am a Muslim I go to a mosque to 
 pray. Good Muslims pray five times a  
 day. When we go to the mosque we take 
 off our shoes. We have to wear a hat  
 called a Topee. We have to wash our   
 hands, face and feet very carefully.  
 This is called Wazoo. Then we all face
 Mecca. The Imam says the prayer called
 Namaz and the people have to listen.  
 We have to kneel down when the Imam   
 tells us. In the evening children go  
 to the mosque to read the Quran and   
 learn about Islam. In class we kneel  
 down and put our Quran on a wooden    
 stand. When we are in the top class we
 have to learn the Quran off by heart. 
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
