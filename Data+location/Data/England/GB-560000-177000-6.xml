		<title>06A VICAR'S WEEK, GRAYS</title>
		<content> An interview with our local vicar     
 revealed that contrary to popular     
 belief - he does not work on Sundays  
 only.He gets up at 6.30,has breakfast 
 and then reads his Bible.He discusses 
 the readings with his wife,then they  
 pray together.He leaves the vicarage  
 to take assembly at two nearby        
 schools, or to attend parish meetings.
 In the afternoon he visits the local  
 hospice to discuss fund raising and   
 talk to the patients.There are three  
 services held in the church every     
 Sunday.Each year there are one about  
 one hundred funerals,fifty baptisms   
 and twenty weddings.Usually his       
 congregation consists of approximately
 one hundred and fifty people,although 
 when the church was featured on Songs 
 of Praise on television, it soared to 
 four hundred and fifty.
