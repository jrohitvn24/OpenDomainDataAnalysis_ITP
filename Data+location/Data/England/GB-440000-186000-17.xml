		<content>   Mr and Mrs Handley have called their
firm at Home Farm "Country Chairmen".  
They reseat chairs in rush and cane and
restore and repair furniture.They have 
recently reseated 1000 chairs for      
Salisbury Cathedral.                   
 The cane is imported from Malaysia but
all the rushes they use are harvested  
locally by themselves and a small band 
of helpers in July each year.They are  
able to provide rushes for about 30    
other craftsmen around the country.    
  Mr Nicholas Dyson studied English at 
Cambridge and worked for 12 years as an
editor for an academic publisher before
deciding to set up as a furniture      
designer and manufacturer.He has a     
small but well equipped workshop, and  
he designs and makes individual pieces 
of furniture in hardwoods to a very    
high standard.
