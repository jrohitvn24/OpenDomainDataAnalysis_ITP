		<content> This S.E.corner of Leicestershire is  
 in the Welland Valley.It is mainly    
 agricultural with good arable and     
 pasture land.The other main feature is
 the Eyebrook Reservoir which covers   
 approximately a quarter of the total  
 area of this block.It was once used   
 mainly for industrial purposes,but is 
 now mostly recreational fishing.      
 The two villages,STOKE DRY and part of
 LYDDINGTON are small communities away 
 from the main A6003,the Oakham to     
 Kettering road which is the only main 
 road passing through the area.The     
 entire population in this block is    
 under 500.                            
 The highest point in this area is 105m
 above sea level,the rest of the land  
 is undulating or flat.In the extreme  
 S.E. corner there is part of a        
 dismantled railway.
