		<title>17GRAVEL QUARRYING</title>
		<content>{ ROBERT BRETT AND SONS}               
The River Stour passing through our    
area has given rise to large gravel    
deposits in the Westbere Marshes area. 
Robert Brett founded the Sturry        
Quarrying business in 1945 when the    
area was all marshland. The land was   
drained and the gravel extracted.      
Originally 35 people were employed at  
the Sturry site but with increased     
mechanization that number has now been 
reduced to 14. The present works       
originally built in 1945 are at Sturry 
on the North side of the River. Gravel 
quarried on the South side of the river
was transported by narrow-gauge        
railway to the works. Use of the       
railway ended in 1975 and it has now   
been dismantled. Gravel deposits at the
Sturry site are exhausted but the      
plant is used for the manufacture of   
Durite from the gravel at Chartham.    </content>
