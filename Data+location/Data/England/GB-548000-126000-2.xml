 Since no new houses are allowed to be 
 built in the area, those which are    
 already here are very much in demand. 
 They come onto the market rarely and  
 fetch high prices. This puts them     
 out of the range of young families or 
 first time buyers and an ageing of the
 population has been noted in recent   
 years. A survey of residents showed   
 that most of them enjoy their         
 surroundings. Hardly any of the adults
 had lived here all their lives but the
 picture is of a settled community who 
 have sought and found a home they     
 really like and intend to stay. It is 
 a popular place for retirement though 
 the elderly are apprehensive that they
 may not be able to continue to live   
 here once they can no longer drive.
