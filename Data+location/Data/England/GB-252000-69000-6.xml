		<content> 4.Where does your{father work? }      
 - Hardly any fathers work in          
 Walkhampton,although some were farmers
 nearby.The majority worked around     
 Plymouth and Tavistock.               
 5.Where do your parents do their      
{shopping?}                            
 - About half shop at local stores and 
 the rest use nearby supermarket and   
 superstores eg. ASDA and TESCO. The   
 TESCO store at Lee Mill was more than 
 10 miles away.                        
   Nobody said their parents made much 
 use of the local shops in the village.
 6. How would you like to{improve}     
 Walkhampton?                          
 -Most children wanted more leisure    
 facilities eg 'leisure centre' or a   
 better,covered swimming pool. One     
 wanted 'a big toy shop' and two       
 thought no improvement needed.
