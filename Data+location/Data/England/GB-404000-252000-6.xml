		<content> My name is Leslie King. I am 10 years 
 old. On Saturday I got up a 9-00am.   
 Breakfast was a bowl of Rice Krispies.
 After I dressed, I went out on my bike
 until 10-30am when we all went to     
 Evesham in the car to do the shopping.
 We got home at half-past eleven. We   
 put all the food away and then had    
 fish and chips for lunch. In the      
 afternoon my friends and I played     
 'Off-side'. This is a game where 2    
 people on bikes ride in the same      
 direction trying to knock the other   
 off by cutting in front of him. At    
 2-00pm we went to the churchyard to   
 put fresh flowers on my Grandad's     
 grave. When we got home we watched    
 'Street Hawk' on the television. When 
 that was finished we played 'Cops and 
 Robbers' on our bikes. We had tea at  
 5-00pm. Later we bought ice-cream from
 the van. I went to bed at 9-30pm.     </content>
