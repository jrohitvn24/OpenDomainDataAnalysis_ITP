		<content> In summer the boys play marbles. You  
 can play for lends or for keeps. If   
 you play for lends, everybody gets    
 back their own marbles at the end of  
 the game. If you play for keeps the   
 person who wins the game keeps all the
 marbles for himself.                  
 The best game of marbles is Chocker   
 where you have to roll the marbles    
 into a hole. The first person to get  
 all the marbles into the hole wins the
 game.                                 
 The girls play skipping. Sometimes you
 just skip on your own. If you do it   
 very fast it is called Peppers. But it
 is best when you have a long rope with
 two people turning it and everybody   
 has a go at running in and skipping.  
 There is a hard game called Double    
 Dutch when two ropes are turned at the
 same time going in different          
 directions. It is very hard.          </content>
