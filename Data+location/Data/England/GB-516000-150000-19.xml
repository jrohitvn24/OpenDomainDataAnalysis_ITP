		<content>    We asked a number of people who we 
 saw if they had any particular worries
 about life today.                     
   One elderly resident of Pinehurst   
 Old Peoples Home said:-               
  "I am worried about{violence}at      
 football matches." Another said:-     
 "It is at home where the violence     
 starts,because the parents are not    
 strict enough." A third said:-        
 "People are not as polite today as    
 they were when I was young."          
  There were local worries of{heavy    
{lorries}on narrow lanes;ancient hedges
 and{footpaths}being dug up and change 
 in the atmosphere of a pub caused by  
 the policy of new chain management.The
 imminent opening of the{M25}caused    
 concern to the pub's owner who might  
 lose{business}and a Managing Director 
 who thought the town might become a   
 tourist attraction and{too busy.      </content>
