 In the early hours of one morning in  
July 1983 a fire started in the main   
buildings of Westwood Hall.Two boys had
started the fire after having used     
matches to help them in their night    
raid on the Tuck Shop.Three days later 
the stones were still too hot to       
touch.In the fire the staff room,4     
teaching  rooms,heads office,main      
stairs and entrance hall were badly    
damaged.Because of its historical value
and beauty the building was            
reconstructed.It is said that 15,000   
pounds worth of damage was done.
