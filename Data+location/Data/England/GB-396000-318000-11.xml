		<content> The Forestry Commission control about 
7000 acres of land.They grow mainly    
Scots Pine and Corsican Pine,some 41/2 
million,with growth of 2200 tons/year. 
One man can fell about 30/40 trees  a  
day and this is done in small patches  
all over the land to avoid large bare  
patches. Some border areas have Silver 
Birch to break the scenery. Young      
seeds are grown in Japanese pots to    
make a good start.This has improved    
germination.Sometimes the cleared land 
is ploughed and sometimes seedlings    
are hand planted directly.Each small   
tree is protected from animals by a    
plastic tube  of about 75cm.  The type 
of forest doesnt provide much habitat  
for wild life.Red squirrels are being  
encouraged and pools drained and kept  
as reserves.The Nuthatch , Greater     
Spotted Woodpecker and Nightjar are    
resident.          (Class J3 Age 10)   </content>
