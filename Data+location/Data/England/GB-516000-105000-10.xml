  Fifty or sixty years ago the         
 Sompting community went to see the May
 Queen being crowned.The old tradition 
 was that the children dressed up in   
 traditional costumes and decorated a  
 semi-circle in flowers.The May Queen  
 rode in a horse-drawn carriage also   
 decorated in flowers.When they got to 
 Sompting Recreation Ground they       
 danced.When it was lunch time they    
 went home.After they had finished     
 lunch they returned to the Recreation 
 Ground and led the procession to      
 Sompting Abbotts.When they arrived    
 they danced for hte two failies who   
 lived there.                          </content>
