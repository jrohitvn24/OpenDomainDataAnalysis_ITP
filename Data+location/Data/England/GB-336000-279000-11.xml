		<title>11THREE ASHES NEAR CLUNBURY</title>
		<content> In{Twitchen,}a tiny hamlet near       
{Clunbury,}three parishes meet at the  
{Three Ashes.}The{Three Ashes}were put 
 there over 100 years ago, long before 
 any one can remember. Now there is    
 only one ash, the other two either    
 died of old age or were chopped down  
 for being too dangerous and           
 overhanging the road. The one still   
 standing might be chopped down soon   
 because it sways in strong winds and  
 may fall down. The reason why the     
{Three Ashes}are so well known is      
 because although the trees are close  
 together in the junction of two county
 roads, each one was in a different    
 parish,{Clungunford, Hopton Castle}and
{Clunbury.}They are visited in the     
 summer by walkers on holiday in the   
 area.                                 
                                       
                                       </content>
