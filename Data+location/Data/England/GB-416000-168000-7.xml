		<content> Many small industries flourish here.  
 There is a leather factory which      
 processes leather brought from Brazil 
 and India and then sells this         
 processed leather, mainly to the shoe 
 industry. The toy industry is         
 represented by two firms making wooden
 toys, and another making puppets. A   
 pottery (whose markets are almost     
 exclusively in the U.S.A.) a guitar   
 maker and a furniture restorer are    
 other examples. There is a factory    
 making ladies' underwear, and another 
 manufacturing hang gliders. There is  
 also a farrier, panel beater, welder, 
 tyre fitter and a small firm of       
 electrical engineers. Many of these   
 small firms are situated in Wagon     
 Yard, off London road.
