		<title>01Dawlish and District</title>
		<content> Dawlish is by the sea and also very   
 hilly. It is mainly a holiday resort, 
 it is busy in the summer.  We have    
 mainly old people in our town who are 
 retired, the people are friendly.  The
 hotels are reasonable but not superb! 
 People who live here usually work     
 outside Dawlish. The most common form 
 of transport is the car, but people   
 also use buses and trains.  Our main  
 tourist attraction is our beach, but  
 also our unusually odd swans which are
 black. We have a children's park where
 children  play all through the week.  
 In the winter it is wet and windy, but
 in the summer it is reasonably warm.  
 Once a year we have a carnival of a   
 mixture of people who dress up. This  
 year we had an elected mayor who helps
 in the running of the town, especially
 with the twinning association, we are 
 twinned with Carhaix in France.       </content>
