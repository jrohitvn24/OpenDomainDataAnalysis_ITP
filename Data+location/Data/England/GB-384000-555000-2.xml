		<content> We carried out a survey of farming in 
 this area. We found that the farms in 
 the area are very simalar.            
 None of the farmers had{arable}land , 
 this is because of the short summers  
 and cool climate in this part of the  
 country. We also found that all of the
 farmers use all of the land for{grass.
 Some of the grass is used for{fodder  
{crops}such as hay or silage.          
 The next thing we investigated was the
 farm livestock.{Sheep}were most       
 popular because of the climate and    
 poor soils, closely followed by{beef  
{cattle}.There are also a few{poultry},
 and occasionally a{horse}but no pigs. 
 We found that the major products which
 the farmers produced were{beef, lamb} 
 and{wool.
