		<title>05Cobbold's Point, Felixstowe</title>
		<content>    The coastline around Cobbold's     
 Point has been attacked by{wave       
{erosion.}Also, many groynes or        
 breakwaters have been placed along    
 this stretch of the coastline. The    
 barriers are here to stop the         
 shingle being washed across the beach,
 because of the wave direction.        
 Protection has been built in the form 
 of a kind of concrete maze at         
{Jacob's Ladder.}This is to stop the   
 grounds of Latimer House falling into 
 the sea, as the cliffs were breaking  
 away. Even now, the steps called      
 Jacob's Ladder, which allow people to 
 climb down to the beach are wearing   
 away and it is becoming dangerous.    
    Swimmers are{warned away}by notices
 which have been erected by the        
 council, saying that it is not        
 advisable to bathe as the currents are
 so dangerous.                         </content>
