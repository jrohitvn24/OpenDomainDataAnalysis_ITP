		<title>07A Farmer's Wife's Life.</title>
		<content> Mrs Barbara Harrold is a farmer's     
 wife. If you think that being a       
 farmer's wife is not much different   
 from any other work, then you're      
 wrong. Her job is very demanding and  
 the hours she works are much longer   
 too. Often she works from 0530 hrs to 
 2200hrs at such things as milking,    
 herding, and many others. She helps   
 her husband when someone has the day  
 off.                                  
 Mrs Harrold takes in guests for       
 farmhouse holidays.                   
 She has many activities to distract   
 her from the farm. She is in the      
 Women's Institute,and sometimes does  
 part time teachimg. She also does much
 flower arranging for the local church 
 and nearby flower festivals.          
 She is a very hard working woman.
