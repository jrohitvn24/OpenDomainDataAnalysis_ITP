		<content>     In our school there are about{250 
{children.}This is small compared to   
 some schools but big to others. There 
 is a saying that your school days are 
 the best days in your life. But you   
 will find not many children agree.    
     There are{33 children}in our class
 which means it is full. We have old   
 fashioned desks in our classroom. Our 
 school is a{114 years old.}I think the
 desks are better than drawers.        
     In our classroom we have{two      
{computers.}They are both Dragons. Our 
 class teacher is called  Mr Benson. He
 is quite funny, although he is a big  
 teaser.                               
     We have{two playtimes}and{one     
{lunchtime.}The two playtimes each last
 25 minutes and lunchtime 1 hour.      
 School starts at 9.00am and finishes  
 at 3.30pm.
