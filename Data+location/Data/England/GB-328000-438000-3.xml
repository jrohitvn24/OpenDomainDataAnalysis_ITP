		<title>03DANGER ON THE CLIFFS</title>
		<content>{REPAIRING THE CLIFFS}                 
  A lot of work went into preserving   
 one of Blackpool's natural features.  
  The landslides on the cliffs were a  
 potential deathtrap.They were poised  
 to come down after a combination of   
 sea-spray,weathering,plus the work    
 associated with the illumination      
 tableaux on top of the cliffs,had     
 weakened them.                        
  Blackpool Borough Surveyers          
 Department took the task of           
 stabilizing the cliffs.This involved  
 stopping deterioration with minimum   
 inconvenience.Further problems were   
 that the cliff surface was loosened by
 poor drainage,and water seeped        
 through the surface to attack lower   
 levels.If not prevented then the cliff
 face would deteriorate beyond repair. 
  A lot of money was invested in this  
 project,to keep the cliffs open.      </content>
