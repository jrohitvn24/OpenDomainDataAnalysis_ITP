		<title>04GROBY VILLAGE HALL.</title>
		<content>    The village hall,which stands on   
 Main Street near the Newtown Linford  
 Road junction,has only been in        
 existence since 1980.It used to be the
 Martinshaw Primary School until then. 
 When the last remaining infant classes
 were moved to the main school the     
 premises became vacant.               
    In the beginning there was no      
 heating and nothing to sit on.For     
 their first meeting the Village Hall  
 Committee had to sit on camping stools
 and boxes.The first public events were
 a flower show and a pantomime both    
 successful.Although the hall is in    
 use,work has not been completed yet.It
 needs to be decorated,a notice board  
 is required and the general facilities
 need improving.The Committee is keen  
 to let the building to almost any     
 group,even those from the next village
 Ratby.                                </content>
