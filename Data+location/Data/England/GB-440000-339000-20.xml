		<title>20IMPROVEMENTS-D.WHITE,H.SCOTT</title>
		<content> AFTER A DISCUSSION WITH MY FRIEND WE  
 AGREED THAT THERE SHOULD BE A FEW MORE
 SHOPS NEAR BY.ALSO THE VILLAGE COULD  
 BE IMPROVED BY SWIMMING POOLS OR A    
 LEISURE CENTRE WHICH INCLUDED TENNIS. 
 THERE SHOULD BE AT LEAST ONE BANK IN  
 THE AREA TO SAVE GOING TO ILKESTON.THE
 ROADS COULD BE IMPROVED BECAUSE THEY  
 BIG POT-HOLES IN THEM,AND ARE IN A    
 TERRIBLE STATE.ANOTHER IDEA WE CAME UP
 WITH WAS THE LACK OF CAR SPACE NEXT TO
 THE CRICKET GROUND.                   
{ ADVANTAGES IN THE VILLAGE.}          
 ONE OF THE ADVANTAGES IS THAT WE HAVE 
 A LOT OF FARMLANDS AND COUNTRYSIDE.ONE
 OF THE IMPROVEMENTS IS ALREADY TAKING 
 PLACE AT SCARGILL PRIMARY SCHOOL.THE  
 IMPROVEMENTS ARE FOUR:NEW CLASSROOMS  
 AND  A NEW CHANGING ROOM TO COPE WITH 
 ALL THE NEW CHILDREN THAT ARE COMING  
 TO SCHOOL NEXT TERM.
