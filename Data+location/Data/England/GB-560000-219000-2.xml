		<title>02Buildings in Dunmow</title>
		<content>   Many of the buildings are very old  
 in design. The Town Hall was built in 
 the Sixteenth Century and is a fine   
 example of an oak timbered building   
 with walls which were originally made 
 of wattle and daub. The floor above   
 ground level is partly supported by   
 jetties. Another old building is the  
 Saracens Cottage which shows the arms 
 of the Fitzwalter and Maynard families
 on the pargetting.                    
   Some of the offices have pillars    
 with canopies over the front doors.   
 The buildings are close together. Most
 windows are of the sash type with     
 mullions between the panes. Some of   
 the new houses have double glazed     
 windows and doors and are insulated   
 which helps stop the heat escaping    
 through the walls and ceilings. Roofs 
 are made of tiles, slates or thatched 
 with straw.                           </content>
