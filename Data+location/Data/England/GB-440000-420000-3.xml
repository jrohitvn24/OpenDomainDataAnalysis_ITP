		<title>03Housing in Feathersone</title>
		<content> The majority of housing in this area  
 is owned by the council.In the past   
 the NCB owned much property but the   
 old back to back terrace housing has  
 been demolished.There has been urban  
 renewal around the colliery with new  
 semi-detached,terraces,maisonettes,and
 old folks bungalows.The new houses are
 built in the old street pattern. Some 
 spaces have been cleared and left as  
 grassed areas but others are still    
 derelict.In the shopping street houses
 are found immediately behind the      
 single row of shops.These are mainly  
 modern houses in crescents,small      
 terraces and cul-de-sacs.             
 North Featherstone and Ackton have the
 oldest houses,farmhouses and small    
 cottages built of stone mixed in with 
 new council estates are built here.
