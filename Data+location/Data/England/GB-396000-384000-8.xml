		<title>08NEW MILLS CARNIVAL</title>
		<content> For many years there has been a       
 carnival in New Mills, and the profits
 have been used to help provide a      
 swimming pool and sports hall in the  
 town.    The people come from towns   
 around and fill the streets with      
 laughter and excitement.    The       
 procession is gaily coloured and the  
 bands play well-known tunes.  Last    
 year the weather was kind to us and   
 the sun shone warmly.   It was full of
 floats and dancers.  Our school float 
 had children as cannibals and our new 
 headmaster was put in a cooking pot.  
 People sold flags and shakers and     
 things that you blow.    People threw 
 money into buckets and on to floats.  
 People would still enjoy the carnival 
 even if the weather was not so good.
