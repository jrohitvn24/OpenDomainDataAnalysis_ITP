		<title>04FARMING IN WELFORD ON AVON</title>
		<content>{Market gardens}are places where       
 vegetables are grown for sale to the  
 wholesaler, who sells them to the shop
 keeper.  We have only one market      
 garden in our area in Welford.  They  
 grow cabbages, leeks, peppers,lettuce 
 and runner beans.  They have nineteen 
 acres of land with long rows of crops 
 and large greenhouses. They have      
 mostly lettuce in them, these they buy
 in at about seven and a half cms.tall.
 The greenhouses are kept at 65 degs.C 
 but they do open the windows in the   
 summer months.The Welford{pig farm}has
 roughly 70 sows. They are continually 
 kept in pens until they reach 82kg    
 live weight, when they are taken to   
 the abattoir to be slaughtered. The   
 farmer grows vegetables to feed the   
 pigs but he also sells some, as well  
 as goats milk. The farm is closed to  
 visitors to avoid infecting the pigs. </content>
