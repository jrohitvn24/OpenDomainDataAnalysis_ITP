		<content>    One of the windows in the north    
 wall of the church of St. Mary's,     
 Fryerning, is a stained-glass memorial
 window to Sir Airey Neave. In 1979,   
 Airey Neave, M.P. for Abingdon, was   
 killed by a car bomb and , in his     
 memory Penelope Neave, a relative,    
 designed and made the window. The     
 Neave family has lived in nearby      
 Ingatestone for several generations.  
    The window consists of two 8 feet  
 (2.4m) high lancets which show        
 different aspects of Airey Neave's    
 life and character. One side shows St.
 Michael beating the devil, with a     
 central medallion of Colditz, the     
 prison from which Airey Neave escaped 
 during the 2nd World War. The other   
 side shows St. Christopher carrying   
 the Christ child, with a central      
 medallion of the Houses of Parliament.
