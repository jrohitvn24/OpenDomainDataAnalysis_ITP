		<title>19  TOWN CENTRE DEVELOPMENT</title>
		<content> In the late 1960's in common with many
 other towns Bury underwent a rapid    
 redevelopment programme. A new market 
 and shopping precinct were built and  
 expansion has continued ever since.   
 Bury is now with Bolton one of the    
 major shopping centres in North       
 Manchester.                           
 The central shopping area contains    
 most of the major chain stores and    
 around Angouleme Way ( Bury's twin    
 town ) large retail units are located.
 One of the features of all development
 has been a large degree of            
 pedestrianisation, and free car park. 
 The town is especially busy on market 
 days which are Wednesday, Friday and  
 Saturday. Early closing is on Tuesday,
 but this is not uniformly observed.
