		<content> Interview with resident:              
    Occupies his ancient cottage,      
 'Merry Meeting' and owns two other    
 cottages, both summer lets, upon his  
 two acres and is wholly               
 self-sufficient in home-grown produce 
 and maintenance work.  Since          
 abandoning secondary P.E. teaching,   
 devotes himself to wild-life          
 conservation, especially nurturing    
 endangered owls and falcons to return 
 to the wild.  As local "contact" he is
 frequently contacted on conservation  
 issues by diverse informants including
 fishermen, poachers and gamekeepers.  
 A keen fisherman, lobster-catcher and 
 falconer, he believes fiercely in     
 scrupulous, sportsmanlike methods     
 which protect the ecology, and is an  
 active campaigner to clean up the     
 polluted, life-destroying waters of   
 the Torridge.                         </content>
