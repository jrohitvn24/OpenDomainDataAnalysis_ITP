		<title>13DISUSED CANAL - KEMPSFORD</title>
		<content>  {The Stroudwater, Severn and Thames  
{Canal}which was opened in 1789 to     
 connect the {Rivers Severn}and{Thames 
  and on which the last cargo was      
 carried in 1911 passes through the    
 area. This section was officially     
 abandoned in 1927. Its most profitable
 period was from 1840 until the        
 railways took over most of its trade. 
 Most of the{canal}has been filled in  
 to become part of the large wheat     
 fields, although where small clumps of
 trees continue to grow, the line of   
 the canal can be discerned. Two hump  
 backed bridges stand isolated in      
 fields. Lines of willows and ash trees
 also identify the old canal, leading  
 onto what was the Agent's house,      
 warehouse and wharf.
