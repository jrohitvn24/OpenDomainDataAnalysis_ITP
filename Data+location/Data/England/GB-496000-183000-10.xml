		<content> My name is Nicola, I am 10 years old. 
 I live in a village called Farnham    
 Common.  On Saturdays I get up at     
 about 8,00 and have a cooked breakfast
 with my brother, mummy and Jane.  My  
 sister has breakfast earlier because  
 she goes riding at 8.15.  Then I do my
 prep and at ll.00 I have a french     
 lesson with my godmother.  Then I ride
 my bike with Jane to the library to   
 get some books, and do some shopping  
 for mummy.  By that time it is lunch  
 and sometimes I have a friend over.   
 In the afternoon we go out somewhere  
 or play in the garden, then I feed our
 rabbit and Jane feeds the dogs.       
 Christopher has a bath and a boiled   
 egg for supper and then he goes to    
 bed.  After that Jane cooks the supper
 and we eat it in the front room on    
 trays watching the television.  I     
 think Saturday is my favourite day.   </content>
