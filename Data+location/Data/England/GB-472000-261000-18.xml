  The Duston Church of England School  
was built in 1856.It was only two rooms
into which had to fit one hundred      
children aged from three to fifteen.   
  The building has since been extended 
and today has one hundred and forty    
children in it.When the school was     
first built the children used to sit   
down in the classrooms from the        
beginning of school to the end of the  
day, hardly moving at all.             
  If the children didn't attend school 
or their work wasn't satisfactory the  
teacher or headmaster would lose some  
of his salary.                         
  Nowadays there are four and sometimes
five classes and the children are aged 
from four to nine.After they leave they
go to either Ryelands or Millway Middle
schools.
