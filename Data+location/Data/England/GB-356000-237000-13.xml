		<content>   The Wye Valley Walk runs through    
 the D-Block.                          
   For entertainment people visit the  
 Moon Inn for a drink or a game of     
 darts. The Pub has a tourist season   
 in the summer but most of its         
 customers are regulars.               
   Every year a fete is held in        
 Mordiford (usually at Sufton Court).  
 There are also barn dances held at    
 Dormington.                           
   To raise money at Christmas the     
 church choir go round carol singing &amp; 
 also there is a regular whist drive.  
 The money raised is donated to the    
 Church of England Society. At         
 Mordiford Primary School they have a  
 school fete &amp; the children put on a   
 play for the locals &amp; parents to      
 watch. The local discos are usually   
 held at the school.
