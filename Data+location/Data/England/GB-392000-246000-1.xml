		<title>01ALLESBOROUGH FARM.</title>
		<content>      Allesborough Farm was listed in  
  the{Domesday Book}of 1086 as the     
 AELIS BOROUGH, that is it belonged to 
 Mr.Aeli, who owned the Borough around 
 the hill.                             
     Parts of the farmhouse date back  
 to 1590 and at one time it was        
 inhabited by the{Earl of Coventry.    
 Today there are 17 rooms and three or 
 four people live there. Mr. Bomford,  
 who now farms the land, has lived     
 there all his life - 58 years.        
     The farmland is 620 acres, all of 
 which are rented, except for 16 acres,
 which belong to{Mr. Bomford.}As crops 
 give more profit than livestock, 444  
 acres are used for{Arable Farming}as  
 follows.                              
         244 acres _ wheat             
         27 acres _ potatoes           
         91 acres _ barley
