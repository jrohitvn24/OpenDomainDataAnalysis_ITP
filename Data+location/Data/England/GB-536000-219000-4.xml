		<content>  The main through-link is the A10 -   
 London to Cambridge.Part of this is   
 dual carriageway but most is single   
 carriageway.It carries a very large   
 volume of traffic in and out of the   
 London area especially during the     
 early morning and evening rush hours.A
 by-pass is planned within the next few
 years for Colliers End and other      
 villages on the A10.This will relieve 
 the traffic conjestion and cut down   
 car pollution to residential areas.   
 Conflicting interests in land use are 
 certain to arise.The small settlements
 which have sprung up along the A10    
 feed off passing trade and are focal  
 points for the stimulation of local   
 industry.The main rural settlements   
 are connected by twisty minor roads   
 both to each other and the A10.
