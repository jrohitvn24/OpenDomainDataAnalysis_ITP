		<title>08The Shop</title>
		<content> There used to be three village shops. 
 Now there is only one. The present    
 shop has been there for over eighty   
 years. The building itself is two     
 hundred years old. Previously it was a
 doctor's room and two cottages. The   
 present shopkeeper has only lived in  
 Cromhall since 1984. Although she has 
 quite a lot of customers, she could do
 with even more local support. Most of 
 her customers are women and children. 
 However, many local people use        
 supermarkets in nearby towns. She     
 provides a more friendly and personal 
 service. The average amount spent is  
 between Â£5 and Â£10. She sells a wide  
 range of groceries and vegetables. The
 most popular sweets seem to be Mars   
 bars and Yorkies.
