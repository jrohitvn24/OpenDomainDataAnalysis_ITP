		<title>11SERVICES: Roads &amp; Water</title>
		<content> There are two{main roads}which run    
 through the region, the{A30}goes west 
 to south from Stockbridge to          
 Salisbury and the{B3084}goes north to 
 south through Broughton. All the other
 roads are unclassified.               
 At the{pump house}at Chattis Hill     
 there is a bore hole which is about   
 three hundred metres deep and and the 
 water is pumped out of the bore hole  
 to the filter bed near Rose Cottage.  
 The water is filtered and pumped to   
 the{reservoir}on Broughton Downs where
 it is stored till we need it.         
 Most houses have their own{septic     
{tanks;}sometimes these have to be     
 emptied. A big sewage lorry comes to  
 suck out the contents and takes them  
 away to spread on the fields to make  
 the crops grow.
