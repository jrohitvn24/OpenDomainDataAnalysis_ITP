 uniform is a special guide hat (dark  
 blue), a red triangular tie, a blue

 have our full pockets every week which
 is a pencil or pen, a rubber, a note  
 pad for writing down dates of special 
 days, a ten pence piece for an        
 emergency telephone call, a           
 handkerchief in case someone hurts    
 themselves, a plaster in case someone 
 cuts themselves, a safety pin for     
 fastening bandages, and a rubber band.
