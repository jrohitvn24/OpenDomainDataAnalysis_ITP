		<title>02Golden Valley</title>
		<content> Golden Valley is a small valley near  
 our school. It is used for all        
 different kinds of purposes such as   
 growing crops like barley and hay.Also
 there are one or two barns. One of    
 these barns has a statuette showing   
 two men with letters M and J on their 
 hats. Above them was a phrase saying  
 "We Wish You Health" and a date 2nd   
 July 1977 which we are going to       
 research.                             
    Across the valley there is a 50cm  
 diameter industrial gas pipeline      
 through Avon to Dorset and Devon. Most
 of the valley is used for barley      
 growing, hay making and pastural land 
 for cattle grazing and a few acres are
 what used to be a tip which is now    
 being filled in.
