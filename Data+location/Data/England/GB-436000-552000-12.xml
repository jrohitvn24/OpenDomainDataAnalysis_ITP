 Tollgate can still be seen near the   
 gates.{Moorhill}was built for the     
{Robson family}who were owners of local
 flourmills, for their family home.    
{ Moorhill}had on the first floor 6    
 bedrooms 2 bathrooms and 3 toilets.   
 The top floor (the attic rooms) were  
 where the servants slept. There are 5 
 bedrooms, 2 toilets and 1 bathroom.

 The butler's pantry is now an office. 
 The wine cellar is now used for stores
 and boilers for central heating and   
 water.
