		<content> In 1919 a company called Sun          
 Engraving was set up in Whippendell   
 Road. They printed magazines with four
 colour illustrations. They had taken  
 over the premises of G.W.Jones Ltd.   
 who had built the factory in 1906.    
 Today the factory is on the same site 
 but has extended over 6 acres. Since  
 1919 the Sun Printers has produced    
 the firstall gravure weekly           
 "Picturegoer" delivered complete from 
 the machine and in 1938 "Picture      
 Post"became the first million         
 circulation weekly. Today they print  
 Woman's Own, Sunday Times Magazine,   
 The Mail On Sunday, Woman's Weekly    
 and T.V.Times. In 1981 2 Cennuit      
 presses were installed costing Â£2     
 million pounds each. In 1981 the      
 company was bought by Robert Maxwell  
 and became Odhams-Sun Printers.
