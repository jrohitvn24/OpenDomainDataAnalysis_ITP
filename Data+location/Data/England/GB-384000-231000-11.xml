		<title>11FORTHAMPTON POST OFFICE</title>
		<content> The Post Office is found in Brewers   
 Cottage in what was the bakery one    
 generation ago. The mail is collected 
 by van from Gloucester as there is no 
 resident postman. Aswell as providing 
 the usual services of a sub-Post      
 Office, it is also the only village   
 shop. The stock is small though it    
 supplies basic needs, and what there  
 is is stacked on the old wooden       
 shelves. A freezer cabinet is the only
 modern device. Without the Post       
 Office, the shop would not be         
 economical since it is unable to      
 compete with the shopping facilities  
 in nearby Tewkesbury. These attract   
 the local people as communications    
 have improved. The Post Office and    
 shop provide the second income of the 
 family suggesting that business is    
 slack.
