 Mr.Wiseman is the market gardener at  
 Muston.                               
{Crops.}He grows grapes, raspberries,  
 spring onions and peaches.The other   
 crops are mainly salads, lettuce,     
 tomatoes,carrots,cauliflowers and     
 sweet peas.Mr.Wiseman was stringing   
 the tomatoes when we visited.         
{Marketing.}He sells his foods in a    
 shop in Belle Vue St,Filey.           
{Horticulture.}He gave the crops water 
 only when it was sunny by a hose_pipe.
 He has about 8200 tomatoes in         
 different green houses. He has some   
 figs which grow to the size of a pear.
 When the peaches started to grow he   
 gently hit the peaches with a rabbit's
  tail on a long stick.The ones he     
 missed were small and they fell to the
 ground.They have one acre of land.    </content>
