		<content>   The original School building,now    
 Junior 4 classroom and the caretakers 
 home,is an L-shaped,stone,typically   
 National Society building first used  
 in 1850.                              
   It replaced a small, two storey     
 Church erected building on the        
 opposite side of Lovely Hall Lane.    
   There were no cloakrooms and the    
 scholars coats hung on hooks around   
 the rooms.There were open ditches on  
 both sides of the Lane and under the  
 hedges on the Common,and these served 
 as toilets and washrooms.The Board    
 Inspectors well might have marvelled  
 to see tha beautiful,clean needlework,
 exercise and copy books.              
   The Tables,with the Creed,the Lord's
 Prayer and the Ten Commandments were  
 removed from the classroom walls in   
 1938.The original fireplace remains,  
 hidden behind the blackboard.         </content>
