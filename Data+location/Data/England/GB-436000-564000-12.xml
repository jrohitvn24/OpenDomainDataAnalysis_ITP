		<content> We worship in a{mosque.}There are     
 rules to follow before we can go into 
 the praying area. We mut take off our 
 shoes then pray to {Allah.}There is a{
{Holy book}which we read called the {  
{Koran}and a nacklace of beads which   
 help us to pray. this is called the{  
{Mushafe.}                             
 You can pray in your own house but you
 must kneel on a prayer mat that is    
 embroidered with a picture of the     
 mosque.The carpet must be facing the  
 mosque or{Mecca.}Men wear white cotton
 hats and women cover their heads with 
 a scarf.                              
 We are not allowed to eat pork or ham 
 because they come from a pig and      
 we must not drink anything alcholic.  
 The {Muslim}people have lived in the  
 Laygate area of South Shields for many
 many years.
