		<content> Broadwindsor school has a gardening   
 club.I am a member of it.At lunch     
 playtime members of the gardening     
 club,go down to the garden to plant   
 things and to get out weeds etc.Our   
 garden is at the bottom of our school 
 playground,behind our school swimming 
 pool.Last year,which was 1984,the     
 gardening club grew some              
 potatoes,somecabbages,some spinach    
 some carrots and one or two other     
 things.We also grew some flowers.they 
 where,some sweet peas and some other  
 flowers.the sweet peas grew to about  
 four metres tall.The school garden is 
 about 12 metres in length and about 9 
 metres in width.The  school gardening 
 club is a thing that is open to class 
 3 only.There are two other            
 clsses,class 1 and class 2,but they   
 are not allowed to do it.
