		<content>The area covered by our survey is      
mostly agricultural and green belt land
The area is a commuter area for those  
working in London.The town of Amersham 
is split into two with the older part  
being  down the hill from the study    
area.The houses are modern and         
generally privately owned.The town has 
a small shopping area and a sporting   
complex.Around the town there is plenty
of countryside which the residents     
have easy access too.The               
businessmen find the area useful as    
the old Metropolitan Railway runs      
straight into the heart of London.There
are a number of places around the area 
thaT have historical merit.i.e,Latimer 
Roman villa and the Old Town.
