Behind the Fox &amp; Hounds Public House   
was the village blacksmith.John Head   
was the last farrier in the village.   
  The Fire Station, The Stags Head P.H.
and the Old Manor House complete the   
picture of Old High St. except for two 
recent additions: a small bookmakers   
premises,and a Chinese Take-away Meal  
shop are in two converted cottages.    
  Beyond the Old Manor House, apart    
from a plastics factory, the street is 
residential.The New Manor House (circa 
1780) has been replaced by sheltered   
accommodation for the elderly whilst   
the grounds have been built up as a    
Council House Estate.
