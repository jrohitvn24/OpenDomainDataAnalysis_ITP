		<content> Mr &amp; Mrs Cory-Wright live at Mackerye 
 End.   They've lived there since 1951.
 The house was built by John Brockett  
 in the 1600's.   There are seventeen  
 rooms in the house.   The house uses a
 well instead of proper water mains.   
 There are two tulip trees in the front
 garden one of them was struck by      
 lightning in the 1700's.   The Cory-  
 Wrights replaced the tree when they   
 moved in.                             
                                       
 There is a bell tower on the roof     
 which was used to bring the farm      
 workers in from the fields.           
 In the back garden is a ginka tree    
 which is rare in Britain.   It has    
 delicate fan-shaped leaves.           
                                       
 Mackerye End is a pleasant house and  
 most of the owners have lived to a    
 right old age.                        </content>
