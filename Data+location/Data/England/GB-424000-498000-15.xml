   Quite a number of people shop at    
 Presto or Hintons.They are            
 supermarkets and have everything we   
 need,including all the groceries,     
 fresh fruit and vegetables, bread and 
 cakes, soft drinks, pet food and ice  
 cream. You go around with your trolley
 and take what you need from the       
 shelves.If there is something you     
 cannot find, you can ask someone who  
 works there or look at the cards      
 hanging over the shelves showing you  
 where things are, with pictures.      
   After you have paid for everything, 
 you wheel your trolley outside to the 
 car park.                             
   Our family goes to a supermarket    
 because the prices are cheaper, there 
 is a big car park and some days they  
 are open until eight in the evening.  </content>
