		<content>{Ferndown}is a rapidly developing,     
 mainly{residential district}situated  
 near the south coast and{Bournemouth, 
 a popular holiday resort. The main A31
 passes through the town,connecting the
 M3 and M27 to the coast with{Poole,   
 and{Swanage}to the west.{Ferndown}is  
 one of the biggest towns in the area. 
 There is not much need to go into     
 the surrounding towns, as Ferndown    
 offers you a wide choice of shops and 
 services. If you wanted to get out of 
 the town for a few hours, there are   
 frequent buses to Bournemouth, Poole, 
 Ringwood, Southampton, Salisbury and  
 Wimborne, or to any of the nearby     
 country villages.                     
 In order to remove heavy traffic from 
 the centre of the town, a new{bypass  
 is already being built and will be    
 completed in two years.
