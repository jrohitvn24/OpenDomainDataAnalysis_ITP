		<content>The building of the Boughton by-pass   
provided new business and employment at
the Gate Services,east of Boughton.    
The former Gate Inn was converted      
into offices for the new business.     
The Gate Restaurant,opened in          
January 1984,employs 8-10 staff,       
opening every day except Christmas.On  
a busy weekend 4-500 car travellers    
use this restaurant,many of them       
foreign tourists on their way          
to and from the Channel Ports.The Gate 
Cafeteria next door,open 24 hours a    
day,caters for the long-distance lorry 
driver.The prices are cheaper and a    
good old fashioned English breakfast of
fried bread,egg,bacon and sausage is   
popular.Behind the nearby petrol       
filling station is a lorry park.A      
lorry driver returning north from      
the continent said he stopped here on  
the way home each time.                </content>
