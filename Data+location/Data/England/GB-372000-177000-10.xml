		<content> THE CODRINGTON ARMS.                  
 This is the only amenity in this area 
 and the only public house for some    
 miles. The house was once owned by the
 Codrington family of nearby Dodington 
 who gave it its name.To-day the       
 landlord rents it from Courages       
 Brewery.Built in !720 of local stone  
 the interior has low ceilings and     
 wooden beams to support it.There is a 
 large car park and facilities for     
 children. Like most pubs in !985 its  
 food trade is important and it has a  
 lengthy menu of traditional pub and   
 also foreign food. It attracts many   
 customers from a large area, from     
 Bristol, Yate and Kingswood.As        
 a'local' it is a meeting place for old
 friends, for others an                
 unspoilt,relaxed place in which to eat
 and drink.
