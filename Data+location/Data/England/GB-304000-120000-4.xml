       In Greenham there is a very     
 ancient house known as Greenham       
 Barton.It is very beautiful. The      
 owners are Mr &amp; Mrs Willis. Mr Willis 
 is a well known artist.               
       There is also a large house     
 nearby called Greenham Hall. It stands
 on a hill. There are rumours that the 
 Hall is haunted.                      
       Below the Hall is the only shop 
 in our block, the post office and     
 general store. It is approached by a  
 long flight of steps up the steep     
 hillside.                             
       The river Tone flows through    
 Greenham. There is a pretty little    
 church beside the bridge. One year    
 there was a flood and you could not   
 drive through it for fear of water    
 going up the exhaust pipe.
