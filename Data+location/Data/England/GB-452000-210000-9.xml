		<content>  There is a Church of England church  
 in both villages, but services are    
 held only once a month. The priest in 
 charge of Woodeaton is the Rev. D.R.  
 Westcott who lives in Islip Rectory.  
  The priest in charge of Elsfield is  
 the Rev. A. De_Vere who lives in      
 Beckley.                              
  Those of a Roman Catholic persuasion 
 who live in Woodeaton are within the  
 parish of St. Anthony of Padua; while 
 for those in Elsfield the parish is   
 Corpus Christi. Both of these churches
 are in Headington, Oxford.            
  Woodeaton is a quaint,  aisle_less   
 church with a box pew. Its most       
 interesting possession is a 14th      
 century wall-painting of St.          
 Christopher fording the stream with   
 fishes at his feet.  He is carrying   
 the Child and over his shoulder is a  
 scroll in Norman French.              </content>
