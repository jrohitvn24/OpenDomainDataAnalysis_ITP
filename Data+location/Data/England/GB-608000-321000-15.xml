		<title>15Whitwell Common.</title>
		<content> Whitwell common is so marshy,a calf   
 sank in it.It is a good place for     
 plants and crops.We had a walking     
 stick cabbage which grew to twenty    
 feet tall because the land is so damp 
 and good.We keep goats, chickens,geese
 on the meadow.We have about one acre  
 of land.It has not been ploughed ever 
 because a tractor would get bogged    
 down.There is a plant called a        
 horsetail which likes to grow in wet, 
 damp places .We have a lot of holly   
 alder,ash, oak and hawthorn trees and 
 bushes.Reeds,yellow iris and marsh    
 marigolds grow in the marshy places.We
 have lots of birds. There is a bittern
 which hides in the reeds.The heron    
 fishes sticklebacks out of the pond.  
 The mallards hide in the nettles and  
 when you get there they make a big    
 noise and fly off.Warblers nest in the
 bushes in the summer.                 </content>
