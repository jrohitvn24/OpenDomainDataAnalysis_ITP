		<title>02A Typical Farm In Our Area.</title>
		<content>      Allergill Farm measures 222      
 acres. Grass is the only crop grown,  
 3/4 is pastureland and 1/4 is         
 meadowland. The farm has three        
 tractors, but contractors are hired to
 do the ploughing. Round hay bales are 
 made, not rectangular. The cubicle    
 shed,where the cows are kept,is the   
 most important building.The cattle are
 kept for beef, not milk.              
  The farmer buys his cattle from      
 Hexham. He has 64 cows, but only one  
 bull. The cows are Fresians and the   
 bull is Charolais. They are fed on    
 silage and hay in the winter.         
  The average number of sheep kept is  
 four hundred ewes and six rams. The   
 farmer has only one breed which is    
 Blue Faced Leicester. He sells the    
 lambs to a butcher for meat. He has   
 problems with stray dogs and foxes    
 worrying his lambs.                   </content>
