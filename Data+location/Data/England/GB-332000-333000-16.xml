		<content> Her{2 sons}live in the other{2 houses.
 One of them is a{farm cottage,}built  
 in{1963,}and the other is a{16th      
 centuary farm house. The house the    
 owner lives in is the largest of the  
 3, and was built in{1822.}They have   
 lived there since{1959.               
     There are{4 men}working on the    
 farm, including the{2 sons. One}of the
 employed men does mainly milking and  
 the other does odd jobs.              
     They rent some land in{North Wales
 where they keep{sheep.}This is not    
 unusual in this area. It is about{70  
{miles}away from where they live.      
     They are not very cut off where   
 they live but it is a bit lonely if   
 you like a lot of people. They do not 
 get out much, partly because they do  
 not want to and partly because they   
 are too busy.  {By Nerys Webster
