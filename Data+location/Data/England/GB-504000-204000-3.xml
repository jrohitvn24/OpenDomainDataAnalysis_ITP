		<content> Within the town are found the old     
 settlements of Two Waters,( Duae      
 Aquae,) Apsley,( a clearing in the    
 Aspen woods,) and Boxmoor (from Box   
 trees). These villages lie along the  
 sides of the Gade and Bulbourne       
 valleys. Of these areas, Two Waters   
 has, apart from the school and bus    
 garage, disappeared although the      
 settlement dates from the 12th        
 century. With the growth of John      
 Dickinson's paper mill, Apsley        
 expanded along the A41 between the    
 canal and railway. Both Nash Mills and
 Boxmoor developed along the valley    
 routeway.  With the establishment of  
 the New Town in the early 1950s       
 Boxmoor, Apsley, Nash Mills and Two   
 Waters were absorbed into the urban   
 growth which spread along the valley  
 sides from old Hemel Hempstead to link
 with the village centres.             </content>
