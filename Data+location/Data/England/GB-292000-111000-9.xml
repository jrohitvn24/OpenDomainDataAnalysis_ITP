		<content>   There are lots of places in our area
 which tourists come to see.  We notice
 the town gets fuller of people and    
 cars in the summer.  The main         
 attractions are:                      
    Knightshayes - A Victorian Country 
 House                                 
    The Grand Western Canal where barge
 trips are offered                     
    The Museum which has got lots of   
 old objects about life and work in    
 Tiverton through the ages             
    Old Blundell's School which is     
 owned by the National Trust           
    Tiverton Castle which is only a    
 ruin really and has had many new parts
 added over the years                  
    St Peter's Church which is over 900
 years old                             
    The countryside where there are    
 lots of Farmhouse Bed and Breakfast   
 places                                </content>
