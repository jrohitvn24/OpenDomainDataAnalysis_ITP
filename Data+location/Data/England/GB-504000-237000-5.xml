		<title>05TRANSPORT MAULDEN BY_PASS.</title>
		<content> The Ampthill to Maulden by_pass was   
 finished in{1984}.It was made because 
 too many lorries,cars and buses went  
 through Ampthill town centre.The      
 by_pass branches off from Clophill    
 road.The traffic comes to the by_pass 
 from Maulden,Clophill and of course   
 from Ampthill.On the side of the      
 by_pass there are ditches running     
 along the edge of the road.These are  
 here because the road had to be raised
 up,also these can be used for draining
 water from the road.The by_pass has   
 successfully kept the rate of traffic 
 down,but we still get a lot of traffic
 coming in to Ampthill from Bedford.   
 There is one roundabout where it is   
 quite common for lorries to roll over.
 So we advise{caution}when appoaching  
 this junction.
