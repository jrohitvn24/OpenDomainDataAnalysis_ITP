		<title>10AN ENJOYABLE SPOT IN KEELBY</title>
		<content> My favourite place which I enjoy going
 to most is called Stones's.It is a    
 stream with grassy banks and fields   
 surrounding it.I have a friend called 
 Phil who lives near the place and we  
 go from Phil's house around the edge  
 of a field.Then we come to a pipe     
 going across the stream as one of the 
 banks is to steep.We walk on the bank 
 so that we avoid mucking up the       
 water.This means we see anything that 
 goes by.When we see an old bag or     
 brick we lift it up because there are 
 often newts and if we are lucky a     
 frog.                                 
 Once we lifted up a tyre and there    
 were about 5 newts.                   
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
