		<title>19THE FLOOD</title>
		<content> Bridge lane is the lowest lying part  
 of Bramhall with a river flowing      
 alongside.For years it had been prone 
 to flooding, increased by the building
 of many new houses in the '60s' and   
 their subsequent connection into the  
 already overburdened drainage system. 
 The council began a major project     
 to relay all the main sewers in late  
 1972; However before work had been    
 completed a very violent thunderstorm 
 in July of 1973 resulted in water     
 gushing from all the grids and the    
 river (Ladybrook) bursting its banks  
 in many places. Shop workers found    
 themselves trapped by the rising water
 level.At 11.30am when the flooding was
 at its maximum,the shops and houses   
 were under water to a depth of three  
 feet.The council arranged for a rubber
 dinghy to rescue the shop workers and 
 householders.                         </content>
