		<title>05MIDDLETON PARK,SOUTH LEEDS</title>
		<content> Middleton Park covers 316 acres of    
 South Leeds and is a natural          
 attraction for many people.           
  Over 45O years ago Thomas Wade, a    
 citizen of Leeds allowed the          
 Corporation to lease the land which   
 forms the park for 999 years at Â£1 per
 year.                                 
 The park is used for walking.There are
 large areas of woodland with wild     
 flowers and animals.                  
  Many sporting activities take place  
 in the park.There is a 18 hole golf   
 course, tennis courts, a bowling green
 and a small lake for fishing.In winter
 parts of the park are used for        
 football and rugby and in summer for  
 cricket.                              
  Many people in our school use the    
 park for walking, ball games or       
 playing in the children's play ground.
  We are lucky to have such a park.    </content>
