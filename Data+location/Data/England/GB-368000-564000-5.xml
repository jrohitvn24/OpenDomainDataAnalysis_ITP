		<title>05Transport in Haltwhistle</title>
		<content>   Haltwhistle has a railway station on
 the Newcastle to Carlisle line with 26
 trains each day.  The busiest weekday 
 train is the 8.24 which carries       
 Haltwhistle children to Haydon Bridge 
 High School.  Adults use the train to 
 travel to work and on Saturdays to    
 travel to larger shopping centres.    
   There is an hourly bus service      
 between Newcastle and Carlisle which  
 travels along the A69 calling in at   
 all the small villages on its route.  
   In the summer months a limited bus  
 service travels from Hexham along the 
 Military Road to Haltwhistle for the  
 benefit of tourists wishing to visit  
 the Roman Wall.                       
   All of these services are subsidised
 and are under threat of cuts.  The    
 majority of local people find a car is
 essential as public services are      
 limited and expensive.                </content>
