		<title>02The P.P.F. Factory</title>
		<content>One boy was able to ask his father     
about working at the factory. They work
to produce food flavours and toothpaste
mainly. The factory staff wear white   
overalls and strong shoes. They use    
sulphuric acid at times. Ten people    
work together on each of two shifts per
day, seven days a week. The workers    
have five weeks annual holiday. The    
boy's father goes to work on a bicycle 
although many people travel by car.    
The factory has recently been built on 
open, flat land with easy access to the
motorway.
