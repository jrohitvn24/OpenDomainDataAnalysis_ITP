		<title>19A WALK ON THE MOORS</title>
		<content>   Machines used to come along and cut 
 the peat and turn it over. The peat   
 was left there to dry and then brought
 back to the mill on trains. When we   
 picked some peat it was very clean and
 it broke into pieces very quickly. We 
 walked a bit further and saw some     
 train lines that led up to Swinefleet 
 near Goole. The train line is not used
 on this part of the moors any-more.   
 The peat had been removed from this   
 area to a depth of between 4-6ft. We  
 walked where there had been a railway 
 which took the peat to the mill for   
 processing. We also saw some Cotton   
 grass, Rhodedendrons, Marguerites and 
 Birdsfoot Trefoil. On the way back we 
 got lost, but walked a bit farther and
 got off the moors safely.
