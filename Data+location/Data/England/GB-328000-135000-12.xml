 Bridgwater Carnival is the largest in 
 the country. The atmosphere is        
 incredible! The people love it. It is 
 held on the Thursday nearest to       
 Bonfire Night. The procession starts  
 at 7p.m. and finishes at about 9.45   
 p.m.. About 40,000 people come to     
 watch it from all over the country. It
 starts at Parkway and finishes at     
 Broadway Lido. Last year 125 carts    
 were entered. Clubs are entered from  
 all over the county. Squibbing takes  
 place after the Carnival and this is  
 always held in the High Street. Squibs
 are large fireworks held aloft by a   
 stick.
