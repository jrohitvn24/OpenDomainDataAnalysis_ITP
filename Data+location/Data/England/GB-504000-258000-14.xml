		<title>14Fund Raising, Thurleigh</title>
		<content> The Church was in need of a new roof  
 for the nave and even with a 60% grant
 from the Department of the            
 Environment, Â£10,000 had to be found  
 by the village people. Fund raising   
 begun - cyder and baked potato, cheese
 and wine parties and Harvest Supper,  
 an auction and all the usual fund     
 raising events. The difference being  
 that they were all held in the nave of
 the Church. In Mediaeval times the    
 nave was always used for fairs, sales,
 markets and for keeping the animals in
 during the winter. It has only been   
 since Elizabeth 1 that the church     
 building has been used solely for     
 worship. St. Peters is now used in the
 same way - for any events as long as  
 they are not 'immoral'.
