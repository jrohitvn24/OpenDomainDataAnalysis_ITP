		<content> The soil in the area is mainly{Oxford 
{Clay}.There is also{sandstone}and{    
{limestone}.In one area where there is 
 a geological fault{gravel}has been    
 pushed up. The sandstone is very      
 useful to farmers because it dries out
 relatively quickly after Winter and   
 they can graze cows on it earlier.    
 Grass grows slowly on it in summer    
 because it is free draining. Water    
 travels along the fault and produces  
 springs. There is some{coal}along the 
 fault. The ponds around the farm were 
 very important for watering stock.    
 They are chipped out of compacted soil
 called{Fuller's Earth}and do not leak.
