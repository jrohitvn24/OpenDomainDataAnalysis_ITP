		<content>  Mrs. X has owned The Riding School   
 for five years. She bought the farm   
 from Chatsworth Estate in July 1980.  
 The farm has seven acres of land.Her  
 two daughters both regularly ride the 
 ponies.One pony,Solar Star, has had   
 four foals.They started a riding      
 school because they wanted their      
 children to learn to ride.The school  
 began to build up after they applied  
 for a licence. They now have about    
 forty horses.
