		<title>20FINAL WORD FROM BRICKENDON</title>
		<content> These pages have been compiled by the 
 following members of Wormley Women's  
 Institute,  Mesdames Butcher, Carter, 
 Clark, Deane, Dunn, Gooding, Hart,    
 Howes, Howard, Oliver, Parsonage,     
 Prosser &amp; White &amp; Miss Parsonage.     
 They wish to acknowledge the valuable 
 help of the residents &amp; employees in  
 the district.                         
 They give the final word to a house-  
 wife living in Brickendon, a Bayford  
 W.I. member! She willingly sacrifices 
 many amenities, even the much needed  
 village shop, to enjoy the peaceful   
 rural locality &amp; greatly favours the  
 village Council's policy to preserve  
 the Green Belt. There is a good comm- 
 unity spirit, people with cars quick  
 to help those without, &amp; good support 
 for organised events. Surely life here
 reflects the W.I. hymn's reference    
 to "this green and pleasant land" ?   </content>
