		<content> the year 1937.                        
   On the 13th December 1982 a great   
 storm damaged the sea wall which led  
 to the demolishment of the colonade   
 around the Marine lake and of the     
 Rozel.                                
   Marine lake was built because if    
 someone wanted to paddle and the sea  
 was out they couldn't go for a paddle 
 unless they walked for miles.Another  
 reason they built Marine lake was if a
 person was swept out to sea he would  
 surely die,but if he was swept out in 
 Marine lake he could grab hold of the 
 causeway and not be killed.That is why
 they built Marine lake.               
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
