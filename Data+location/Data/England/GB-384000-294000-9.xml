stone pillars. There are three on each 
side.                                  
   The oldest grave in the churchyard  
is from 1765.                          
    The font is round with patterns    
on.It is very old and made of stone.   
It is used for baptizing children.     
Behind it is a baptismal roll with all 
the babies names on.  All Saints       
Church services are held on Holy Days  
and on Sundays at 8.00am.,             
10.00am.,and 6.30pm. The tower has six 
bells which are rung before a service  
to call people to church.     The      
vicar reads The Bible from the         
lectern. He preaches his sermon from   
the pulpit. It is made of wood and is  
old.                                   
   There is another smaller church     
of the same religion in Lower Penn.
