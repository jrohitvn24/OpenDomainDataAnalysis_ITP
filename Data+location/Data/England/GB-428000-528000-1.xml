		<title>01Outline of Chilton area.</title>
		<content>   The D block comprises an area of    
 undulating land the bulk of which     
 supports mixed farming.               
   There are four main areas of settle 
 ment. The largest of these by far is  
{Chilton}with some 5500 inhabitants.   
{Rushyford,}one kilometre south,       
 includes a residential hotel and a    
 small private housing estate.{Bradbury
 is a hamlet 3 kilometres SE of        
 Chilton. The southern tip of{Ferryhill
 just impinges the block on its        
 northern boundary.                    
   Once an area heavily dependant on   
 coal mining this activity has now     
 ceased and employment in the area is  
 found mainly in nearby light          
 industrial estates.                   
   The area is crossed, in a north     
 south direction,by the A1(M), the main
 east coast railway line,and the former
 A1, which passed through Chilton.     </content>
