		<content>{Westlea Primary School}opened in 1983.
 There are 10 classrooms, 3 library    
 areas ans a hall which is used for    
 assemblies,P.E.,and dinners. Our      
 uniform is brown and white and there  
 are 230 pupils. The classes are mixed 
 in age and ability and We do a lot of 
 topic work, Maths, English, gardening 
 and carpentry. We have a computer, a  
 colour TV., piano, copier and musical 
 instruments.                          
{Birch street School} opened in 1887.  
 There are 90 stairs and 14 small      
 classrooms. Many are not used.All the 
 rooms have cracks in the ceilings and 
 walls. We have a Youth club which is  
 10p to get in.I like my School because
 I have nice friends.                  
 Many Swindon Schools have been closed 
 because of the falling birth-rate.
