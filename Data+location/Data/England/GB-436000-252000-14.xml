 In our school lots of different games 
 are played in the playground.One game 
 is Rotten Eggs.Rotten Eggs is played  
 with a ball.You get in a circle then  
 throw the ball around it.If someone   
 drops the ball they have to run after 
 it while the rest run away from it.   
 When the person gets the ball he      
 shouts stop and everybody freezes.Then
 he tries to hit someone.If he does    
 then that person has to throw the ball
 up.If not he has to throw it.If       
 somebody catches it they have a rotten
 egg.If they don't catch it they don't 
 get a rotten egg.                     
    Another game is Sticky Glue.In     
 Sticky Glue one person is on.When he  
 tigs someone they have to freeze with 
 their legs open.To get free someone   
 has to crawl through their legs.
