		<title>01Sandtoft and Environs</title>
		<content> Mainly agricultural land surrounds the
 hamlet of Sandtoft, which is part of  
 the parish of nearby Belton.  The     
 Reindeer Inn is a very popular pub and
 restaurant serving not only the local 
 populace but people from quite a      
 distance round the area.  The Sandtoft
 Transport Centre is primarily for     
 preservation and operation of trolley 
 buses but it also includes other items
 of transport interest.  Based on a    
 former world war 2 aerodrome, it has a
 collection of over 60 vehicles from   
 all over Britain and the continent.   
 Advanced factory units have also been 
 built on part of the the aerodrome by 
 the district council to encourage     
 industry to the area.
