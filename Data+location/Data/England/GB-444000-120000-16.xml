		<title>16LIFE AT CRESTWOOD SCHOOL</title>
		<content> We started new at Crestwood,          
 It's building is unique.              
 The trees inside the crescent         
 Will blossom out next week.           
 They're planing down the benches      
 Banging in the nails                  
 And soon in the metalwork room        
 They'll be helping British Rail.      
 Because it's so new                   
 It looks quite out of place           
 Yes it's so new                       
 Like something from outer space.      
 It's chips again for dinner,          
 Salt and vinegar too                  
 And you should see the size of pizzas 
 There's enough to feed a zoo.         
 They're playing on the computer       
 It's really fun and games             
 It helps improve their spelling       
 Now they call each other names.       
                                       
                                       </content>
