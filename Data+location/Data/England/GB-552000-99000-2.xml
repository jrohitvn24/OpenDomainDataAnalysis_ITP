		<content> The Plough and Harrow public house in 
 Litlington is a popular eating and    
 drinking centre for local people,     
 passing motorists, holiday visitors   
 and many walkers and cyclists.It has a
 large car park -  an essential amenity
 as the pub itself abuts the main road 
 through the village.At the far end of 
 the car park a footpath leads to a    
 bridge over the River Cuckmere.Towing 
 paths are provided in each direction  
 so that walkers can reach Alfriston or
 Exceat in pleasant rural surroundings.
 The pub is 600 years old and was      
 originally two farm cottages linked   
 with existing dwellings.The original, 
 large open fireplace is still used.   
 Until 1961 the pub was owned by a     
 brewery but after extensive           
 modernisation it became a Free House. 
 This means that it is owned and       
 managed by the resident proprietor.   </content>
