		<title>14The pig farm.</title>
		<content>  On the pig farm there are 180        
 breeding sows, which are crossed large
 white and landrace. They are bred as  
 lean bacon pigs. The sows breed all   
 year and each sow produces about 20   
 piglets. The pigs are fed twice a day 
 automatically with barley meal and    
 soya products.The pigs eat 80 tons of 
 meal a month. At 160 days old the pigs
 are sold to a firm in{Wolverhampton   
 who make many kinds of pork products. 
 The farm covers 2 acres. The average  
 selling price for a pig over the year 
 is Â£62. A vet visits regularly because
 there are many pig diseases and the   
 farmer believes in prevention rather  
 than cure. If visitors do come to the 
 farm they must wear protective        
 clothing to be allowed in.
