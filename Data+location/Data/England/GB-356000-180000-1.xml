		<content> The  "D" block is divided from NE to  
 SW by a scarp slope, separating the   
 flood plain of the River Severn from  
 the higher ground, which rises to 84m.
 Diagonally across the block, following
 the line of the scarp, runs the M5.   
  The largest residential area is part 
 of the Patchway Estate. The block also
 includes the village of Easter Compton
 and the hamlets of Over and Compton   
 Greenfield.                           
   Filton Airfield occupies the SE     
 corner, the runway extending along the
 S edge of the block.                  
  On the edge of the estate are        
 warehouses and a hypermarket. In the  
 NE corner, the Patchway Railway Tunnel
 debouches into a cutting. Also in the 
 block is a breeding establishment for 
 the Bristol Zoo, and a permanent Gipsy
 Camp. Most of the area is given over  
 to grassland farming.                 </content>
