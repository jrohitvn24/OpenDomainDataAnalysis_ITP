		<content> Brattleby is a hamlet with a          
 population of 69.   There is no shop, 
 public house or garage, but a very old
 stone church still regularly used.    
 In this village lives the Rev. Denzil 
 Wright who was born in 1907. He       
 has been a resident of Brattleby all  
 his life and remembers, when he was   
 only four the coronation of George V. 
 As part of the celebration a fair was 
 held at the nearby village of Ingham. 
   The village has changed very little 
 during those 78 years.  Most of the   
 houses are made of limestone dug out  
 of the hill in Brattleby and are      
 between a hundred and two hundred     
 years old.  A few dwellings have been 
 built recently. In the early Domesday 
 book it is reported that the Bishop of
 Durham owned much of the land in      
 Brattleby and the church was named St.
 Cuthbert in connection with Durham.   </content>
