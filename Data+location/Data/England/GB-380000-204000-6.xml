		<content>     The pole itself always comes from 
 a valley where it grows tall and      
 straight to reach the sun.It is made  
 of larch which is strong and should   
 last 20 to 30 years. Mr Wheeler finds 
 the right diameter by putting his arms
 around the tree.                      
     The pole used to be carried by hay
 wain from the green in front of the   
 Crown Inn where it was painted,to the 
 village green. Here it would be       
 erected by hand using three sets of   
 pulleys attatched to house's  nearby. 
       It was placed six feet into the 
 ground, the vertical line being taken 
 from the corner of a row of cottages. 
 Nowadays a crane is used. This year   
 it was weighed and, at a height of 84 
 feet and one and a half tons, it is   
 the tallest free standing maypole in  
 the country.
