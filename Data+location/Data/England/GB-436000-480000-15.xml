 CHAIRS.I WAS ALL TENSE AND NERVOUS AND
 I HAD GOOSE PIMPLES ON MY LEGS.       
 WHEN WE WENT INTO SCHOOL AFTER LUNCH  
 PEOPLE WERE ARRIVING.THEN WE WENT OUT.
 I TALKED TO REBECCA ON THE WAY AND SHE
 DIDN'T KNOW IF SHE COULD BEAT ME.     
 SOON ALL THE MUMS AND DADS WERE HERE  
 AND WE STARTED THE SPRINTING RACES.   
 WHEN IT CAME TO OUR RACE WE WALKED    
 RIGHT TO THE TOP OF THE TRACK AND     
 LINED UP.MR.CHORLTON SAID:'GET SET'   
 AND 'GO!'                             
 WE ALL STARTED TO SPRINT OUR FASTEST. 
 AT THE END REBECCA WAS GIVEN A CARD   
 WITH '1ST'WRITTEN ON,MINE HAD '2ND'ON 
 AND KERRY WAS THIRD.

 MINE TO MY TEAM BAND AND WENT TO SHOW
