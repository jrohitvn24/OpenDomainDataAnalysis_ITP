		<content> Salterhebble sewage works treats waste
 products derived from home and        
 industry.  On average 50 gallons of   
 water per day per person are treated  
 at the works serving 97000 people.  A 
 similar abount comes from textile,    
 brewing and confectionary factories.  
 In dry weather the volume received is 
 about 10 million gallons and ten times
 that in wet.                          
 The first attempt to treat sewage was 
 in 1899, later developments in 1911,  
 1929,1939 and 1967.   The main sewer  
 system is operated by gravity and     
 sewage from Elland and West Vale is   
 pumped to Salterhebble.   Following   
 three stages of treatment water is    
 pumped to the River Calder and sludge 
 is tipped at Lowfields, Elland.
