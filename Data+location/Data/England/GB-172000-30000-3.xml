		<title>03TREVERVA FARM</title>
		<content> Treverva farm used to be sited on     
 the southern side of Treverva,but now 
 it has moved up to right opposite the 
 Post Office.Treverva farm belongs to  
 Mr.Ivor Dunstan and he has lived there
 all his life(40 years).He owns 20     
 hectares comprising mainly of pasture.
   Every morning his two employees     
 check the number of cattle,then they  
 tend the grassland with manure.       
   The farmer keeps 500 cows and a few 
 bulls.The calves from the suckler herd
 are fattened and sold.He sends his    
 lifestock to an abatoir in            
 Northampton.                          
   He said"The turnover of his farm in 
 a year is comparable to that of his   
 father's life time!"
