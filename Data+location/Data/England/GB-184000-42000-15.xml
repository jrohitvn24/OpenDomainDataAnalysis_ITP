		<content> In this area we have a liberal Member 
 of Parliament but the government is   
 Conservative.My mum does not like them
 very much.David Penhaligon is our     
 M.P.and he came to our school when his
 son was playing football against us.We
 won.                                  
   Truro has a Mayor and two years ago 
 Mr.Smitherman,one of our governors was
 mayor.He wears a big gold chain round 
 his neck to show he is the Mayor and  
 he came and told us all about what it 
 means.                                
   When we have to choose a councillor 
 or mayor we have an election but not  
 many people bother to vote.I think    
 they should have to.They do their     
 voting in schools quite often and then
 the school is closed for the day and  
 we do not have to come.
