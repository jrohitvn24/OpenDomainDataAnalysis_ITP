		<content>  Chalks Farm has been there several   
 hundred years .Brian Ellis has been at
 the farm all his life. Everything is  
 done by machines now but ploughing    
 used to be done by horses pulling  the
 plough. It is an arable farm. Machines
 have made farming much more efficient.
 Brian Ellis likes the farm a lot more 
 with all the machines than without    
 them.                                 
{Claylane farm.  }                     
 Claylane farm used to belong to       
 Captain Morris.There used to be a     
 dairy herd there but Captain Morris   
 sold it off to Hancocks.Before he     
 sold it Mr Hancock used to be the     
 cowman.The Dairy Herd used to have    
 about 150 cows in.Hancocks building   
 yard has now taken over Claylane Farm 
 and has made one house into offices.
