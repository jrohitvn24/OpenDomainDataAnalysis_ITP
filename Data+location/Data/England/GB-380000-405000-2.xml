		<title>02LOCAL ISSUE- SAND QUARRY.</title>
		<content> In January 1984 planning application  
 was made to the G.M.C by a firm to    
 extract sand and gravel from a hill in
 the area north west of the village of 
 Simister. The firm's intention was to 
 excavate 1000 metric tons of gravel   
 per week for four years and then to   
 restore the site.                     
 This application caused a furore in   
 the village. An Action Committte was  
 formed, a protest meeting held in     
 February, the support of M.P. David   
 Sumberg and local councillors was     
 successfully sought. The press and T.V
 were given interviews.                
 However as the plan involved mineral  
 extraction it had to be dealt with by 
 G.M.C rather than the local council,  
 the plan was appoved with conditions. 
 A public enquiry was held in Bury and 
 the result of the decision is now     
 awaited from Dept of the Environment. </content>
