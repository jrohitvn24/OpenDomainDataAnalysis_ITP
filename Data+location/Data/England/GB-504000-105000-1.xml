		<title>01ANGMERING AREA</title>
		<content> To the north of this area the land is 
 rolling chalk downs reaching 99m above
 sea level and sloping gently          
 southwards towards a flat coastal clay
 plain, south of the A27 trunk road.   
 The downland consists of many scenic  
 clay valleys with dispersed           
 settlements, mainly farm cottages.    
 Most people live on the coastal plain.
 This area is 50% mixed woodland and   
 50% farmland. The land is owned by the
 17th Duke of Norfolk and the daughters
 of the 16th Duke.                     
                                       
 The farming is mixed with wheat,      
 barley, rape seed, oaks, linseed,     
 dairy products and mushroom           
 growing. The A27 cuts across  the     
 southern part. The area includes the  
 north part of Angmering and Poling    
 village. There are 3 disused chalk    
 pits in this area.                    </content>
