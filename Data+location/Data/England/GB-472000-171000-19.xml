		<title>19MOBILITY OF POPULATION</title>
		<content>   About half of the children in our   
 school have lived in Earley all their 
 lives and a further 18% have only     
 moved locally.  We have equal numbers 
 moving from southern England and other
 parts of the country. 5% of our pupils
 have moved several times and a further
 5% have moved from abroad. Most of the
 children coming to this country have  
 professional parents and moved because
 of their father's work. A few are     
 normally resident abroad but came     
 because of parents connections with   
 The University or local business.     
   {SCHOOL TRAVEL (Earley St.Peter's) }
  About 2/3 come to school by car, just
 under 1/3 walk and the rest cycle.This
 is because some people live too far   
 away from the school to walk and      
 public transport isnt very convenient.
 Some children walk part of the way.Not
 many cycle because traffic is heavy.  </content>
