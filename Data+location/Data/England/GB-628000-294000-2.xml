		<content> A wide range of crafts &amp; hobbies gives
 pleasure to many.Mothers make soft    
 toys for their children,later their   
 interest &amp; skill find a financial     
 outlet at W.I.Market or Craft Fair.One
 very artistic individual creates      
 collage pictures &amp; church embroidery; 
 another specialises in soft           
 furnishings;others make church        
 kneelers or are gifted dressmakers.   
 There are those who are skilled in    
 cooking &amp; catering,who can ice a fine 
 wedding cake,while many bake their own
 bread.                                
 The more masculine metalcrafts are    
 found in an engineering workshop &amp;    
 ability in woodwork has produced      
 splendid dolls' houses.

 competitions each year.These are fully

 flower gardens &amp; vegetable plots.     </content>
