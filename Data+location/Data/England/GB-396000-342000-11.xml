		<content>   Farming predominates and the        
luscious green fields with its hedgerow
provide ample acres of grassland for   
the cattle and sheep to roam the       
hillsides. Those members of the village
not involved in farming travel out to  
the industry of Cheadle or the         
Potteries. A small bone meal factory   
and bulk seed producer/distributor are 
the only independant work units in the 
area. The old Foxfield Mine is at      
present being regenerated (for a few   
months at least) while the coal that   
remains is excuvated and its spoil tips
levelled.                              
   Walking along the lanes you could   
well imagine life of earlier days. Mrs 
Dale recalls how old Mr. Dale          
delivered the post on foot and how he  
was only allowed an allowance of ten   
pounds per week for the Post Office.   
In 1914 O.A.P. was 5 shillings.        </content>
