 eastern edges.In the east is the A34  
 Stratford Road &amp; in the west is the   
 A435 Alcester Road.There is one "B"   
 class road ,the B4102 ,which also     
 enters the grid on the eastern edge.

 estate roads contained in the block.  
 BUSES

 However the rest of the block is      
 largely rural and services are poorer.
