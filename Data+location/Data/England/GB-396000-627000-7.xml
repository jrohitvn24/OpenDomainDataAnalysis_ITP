		<content> The Choral Society have been together 
 since about 1970.They have produced   
 shows such as Iolanthe,The Mikado,HMS 
 Pinafore and The Gondoliers.Most of   
 the productions have been the works of
 Gilbert and Sullivan.                 
     There are about 16 men and 23     
 women in the society.Some have been in
 the society since the beginning.Shows 
 are staged in the spring each year and
 there are usually four performances.  
 People travel from all over north     
 Northumberland to see the show.       
     Money for the society is raised   
 through coffee mornings,dances and    
 other shorter performances during the 
 year.
