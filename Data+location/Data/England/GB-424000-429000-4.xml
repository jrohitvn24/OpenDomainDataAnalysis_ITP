		<content>{Farming was of great importance in    
 this area.Corn brought prosperity;poor
 harvests during several years led to a
 decline.Today farming is on a small   
 scale.The land is mainly used for     
 grazing;there is a small acreage of   
 arable land growing winter wheat.The  
 farms are family concerns with small  
 numbers of animals;Spring End Farm has
 eighty three pigs and thirty beef     
 cattle.Little machinery is used.      
{Near Cottingley estate is Snittles    
 Farm which has been there for over two
 hundred years.The farm comprises      
 several buildings including an old    
 farm cottage.A variety of animals are 
 to be seen including donkeys, dogs,   
 pigeons,cats,hens,a goose,cows and    
 horses.There is a riding school and   
 the horses are show jumpers.A flock of
 forty seven sheep graze on the rough
