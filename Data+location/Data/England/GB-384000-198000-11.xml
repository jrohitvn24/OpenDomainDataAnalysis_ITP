		<title>11MINCHINHAMPTON - CATTLE</title>
		<content> Cattle marking started hundreds of    
 years ago.                            
 278 cattle were marked in 1985 on     
{Minchinhampton Common,}and it takes 3 
 or 4 men to mark them all. Only       
 animals from farms registered under   
 the{Common Registration Act of 1965}  
 are allowed to graze. (The animals    
 also use  Rodborough Common.          
 The most popular breed of cattle is   
 the{friesian.}There are relatively few
 pure bred cattle on the Common because
 they are mainly{cross bred.}          
 The maximum number of cattle allowed  
 on the Common is 400. It costs Â£4 each
 for{horses}and{cattle}to graze and Â£2 
 for{goats.}The other animals allowed  
 on the Common are{sheep}and{pigs.}    
 Goats have tethers which have to be 15
 yards from any roads or footpaths.
