		<content>  We went to the{DART VALLEY RAILWAY   
{COMPANY}and we spoke to one of the men
 in the office. He told us about{MR    
{BEECHING}who axed the branch line     
 between{ASHBURTON }and{TOTNES. BRITISH
{RAIL}did away with passenger transport
 in{1958}and goods in{1962.}In {1964-65
{DART VALLEY RAILWAY COMPANY}bought the
 line from{BRITISH RAIL}In 1984 the    
 company had the biggest profits and   
 are doing well. In 1969 the private   
 line was opened and has been running  
 for 16 years.In 1985 the railway had  
 access for passengers to get off at   
 Totnes.They have four engines and two 
 diesels.The oldest engine is nearly   
{100 years}old.It doesn't work and is  
 now in the museum.Each engine uses    
 three quarters of a ton of coal and   
{5-600}gallons of water a day.
