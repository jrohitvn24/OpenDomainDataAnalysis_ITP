		<title>02The History Of Poole Harbour</title>
		<content>    This is the second largest         
 natural harbour in the world.         
    In the war the harbour was used by 
 flying boats to ship troops to the    
 fighting countries and Winston        
 Churchill visited the harbour to see  
 the first flying boat take off. In the
 Second World War a runway was built so
 that Sunderland Bombers could be      
 stationed at the harbour.             
    The standard of the beach varied   
 according to the opinions of different
 people. Some people thought that the  
 sand is fine and clear and free of    
 pebbles, stones and other dirty       
 material while others think it is     
 tourists who are to blame for the     
 litter problem.                       
    We saw many sea sports in the      
 harbour: sailing, windsurfing,        
 speedboat racing and water_skiing.
