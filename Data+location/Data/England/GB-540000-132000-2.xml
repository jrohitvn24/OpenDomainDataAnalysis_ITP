		<title>02ASHDOWN FOREST</title>
		<content> Years back, in the 1300's {Ashdown    
{Forest}used to be a Royal Game        
 Park.The whole area,{6,400 acres}in   
 all were surrounded by a fence called 
 a{Pole.}The Pole fence was set on one 
 of the banks of a ditch, the ditch    
 being on the inside of the park. This 
 was a clever way of increasing the    
 population of the deer park as the    
 wild deer could jump the fence into   
 the park but could not clear the ditch
 and the fence to escape.In the{1690's}
 parts of the forest were sold off to  
 private landowners so the area today  
 is much reduced. However, it is still 
 a very large area that is much used by
 many people for picnicking,{horse     
{riding,}and walking. There is a {     
{Forest Centre}that manages the Forest 
 and protects it against the many      
 modern dangers of fire, pollution and 
 over-use by the many visitors.        </content>
