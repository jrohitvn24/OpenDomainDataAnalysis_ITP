		<title>13Farming in Kemsing</title>
		<content>In our area the predominant            
agricultural land use is pastureland,  
with very small areas of orchard and   
grain crops.                           
The grazing areas are of rough pasture 
in fields which vary in size from      
approximately 750sq.m. to 2000sq.m.    
This is permanent grassland used on a  
rotational basis with neighbouring     
fields for sheep (mainly Kents) and    
horses.                                
These fields are largely separated by  
hedges of hawthorn, hazel and oak, with
blackberry, dog-rose and convolvulus   
mingling amongst them, though barbed   
wire fences thread through the hedges  
to close gaps where the original hedge 
has died.                              
The orchards in this area are small    
patches of apple orchard, and any      
fields of grain crops are very small.
