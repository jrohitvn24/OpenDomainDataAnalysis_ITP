		<title>04Basingstoke Development</title>
		<content> Basingstoke was a small market town   
 situated in the Loddon valley, with   
 the main A30 road passing through it. 
 The railway provided an efficient link
 into London. It was decided in the    
 early 1960's to make Basingstoke an   
 overspill town for London.  In 1963   
 the first review Town map was approved
 setting ot the details of the town's  
 expansion.  Of the estates within our 
 area, Popley 1 and 2 received planning
 permission in 1965.  There has been   
 development on the north side of      
 Basingstoke up until the end of the   
 1970's.  There are no further plans to
 develop this side of the town. There  
 is a policy of maintaining a "Green   
 Belt" between Basingstoke and the     
 northern satellite villages.
