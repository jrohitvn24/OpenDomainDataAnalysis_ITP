		<title>16   PRESENT AND FUTURE</title>
		<content>  Recently many newcomers have moved to
 here. One newer resident thinks,      
{ "The rural character of the village  
{should be preserved and buildings of  
{historical interest conserved (church,
{village green, allotments, ancient    
{footpaths, etc.) Future development   
{should be carefully considered in     
{keeping with the character of the     
{village and rural crafts encouraged." 
  An old resident said about housing,  
{ "As part of the village is old       
{property in a conservation area, these
{houses are expensive to maintain and  
{repair. New properties should be two  
{bedrooms suitable for young people or 
{those whose families have left home   
{and a small number of bungalows       
{preferably owned by the W.D. Council  
{for older people. On marrying most of 
{our young people have to leave because
{there is no suitable accommodation."  </content>
