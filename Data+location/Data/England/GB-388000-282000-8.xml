		<title>08STOURBRIDGE SWIMMING BATHS</title>
		<content> The public{baths}in Stourbridge were  
 opened in 1900.It is rather unusual   
 because there are two pools.The indoor
 pool measures twenty five yards.The   
 outdoor pool measures thirty three and
 one third yards and it has a diving   
 board and{sunbathing}area.It is open  
 during Summer months only.The indoor  
 pool is open every day of the week and
 it costs sixty five pence for adults  
 and thirty five pence for children.The
 baths were built on top of an         
 underground well and the water from   
 the well is used to "top up" the water
 level in the two{swimming}pools.The   
 swimming baths are situated           
 appropriately enough in Bath          
 Road,which is right in the centre of  
 Stourbridge.The swimming pool offers  
 many Stourbridge people,both old and  
 young,the opportunity to enjoy their  
 leisure and{recreation}time fully.    </content>
