		<title>15BELL RINGING IN RISELEY</title>
		<content>      In Riseley Church tower there are
 5 bells which were rehung for change  
 ringing in the new frame work in 1973.
 For th following 8 or 9 years a full  
 team could be heard ringing every     
 week.  Now however due to people      
 leaving the village and/or losing     
 interest there are very few ringers   
 and,although a team can be found for  
 special occasions such as weddings and
 christmas,there is no regular team to 
 ring on Sundays for the church        
 services.  At the present time there  
 is a move afoot to try to start a     
 regular practice night again and get a
 competent team of change ringers.     
 Once the bells are heard ringing again
 it may arouse an interest in the      
 people near to the village to have a  
 go at ringing and swell the numbers of
 the team of ringers.
