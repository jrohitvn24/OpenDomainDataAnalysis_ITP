		<title>16LANDSCAPE IN NETHERBURY</title>
		<content> This area is entirely rural, the      
 largest area of buildings being that  
 of Beaminster, dominated by the fine  
 church tower with many pinnacles.  The
 villages of Stoke Abbott and          
 Netherbury nestle in the deep lanes,  
 each having a church with a tower, the
 latter much hidden by scaffolding for 
 the repair of stonework and regilding 
 of the clock.  The buildings all over 
 the area are mostly of mellow stone,  
 often Ham stone, many with thatched   
 roofs,with some less traditional      
 bungalows of recent date, the whole   
 set in soft green valleys with small  
 rounded hills, quiet streams and many 
 trees, woods and copses.  Important   
 architectural features could be Strode
 Manor House, of about 1830, with a    
 garden featuring small hedged "rooms" 
 and Parnham House, a Tudor mansion,   
 John Makepeace's School of Woodcrafts.</content>
