		<title>04WOOD HALL FARM.</title>
		<content> Wood Hall farm is one of four farms in
 the area concentrating on arable      
 farming, it lies about half a mile    
 North of the village of Cridling      
 Stubbs.                               
 It is a family run concern , with the 
 main crops being Corn,Sugar Beet,and  
 Potatoes.                             
 They have a limited amount of         
 machinery, eg.Tractor and a Combined  
 Harvester, and only employ outside    
 help at the really busy times such as 
 harvesting.                           
 The farm itself is of ancient origin, 
 dating back to the Fourteenth Century.
 Remains of its Medieval Moat are still
 in evidence.Such defences required a  
 special licence from the King,which   
 suggests the owner was a person of    
 note.
