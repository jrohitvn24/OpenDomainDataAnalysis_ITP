		<title>11Transport in Bexhill</title>
		<content> Most people think that public         
 transport in Bexhill is awful. The    
{trains}which run through Bexhill      
 Central can take you directly to      
 London(Victoria), Eastbourne,         
 Brighton, Hastings, Ashford, Lewes and
 Gatwick Airport, to name just a few.  
 It is a good service, with about four 
 trains either way each hour.          
 The{bus service}is pretty awful. The  
 timetable does not link up with the   
 train times. Cut in services have     
 badly affected the buses, especially  
 in the outlying areas. Some friends   
 have set up a{community bus service}so
 that the old and disabled can reach   
 the town centre more easily. Hastings 
 and District (National Bus Company)   
 run a few buses into and out of       
 Bexhill, but the majority of the      
 services are run by the Bexhill       
 Corporation Bus Company.              </content>
