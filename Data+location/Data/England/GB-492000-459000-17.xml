		<content>      In Wetwang we havn't got a park  
 which is a pity but most children play
 out on{rollerboots}and they go{bike   
{riding.}                              
      We can{play on the school field  
 after school as well as at school so  
 most of the boys play{football}on it. 
      Some people play{tennis}on the   
 school playground and we play all     
 sorts of games.In winter the pond is  
 good for{skating}on and it's good just
 to go{sliding}on the school           
 playground.                           
      Wetwang is a good place for      
 having a{walk}because there's lot of  
 places to go like for example down    
 Green Lane. It's a nice walk down     
 Station Hill.                         
      It's good down Northfield        
 Road where the railway line used to   
 be.
