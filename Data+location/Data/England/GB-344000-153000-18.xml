		<title>18CHEDDAR CHEESE</title>
		<content>{Cheddar Cheese}forms part of the hard 
 cheese group. Cheddar is probably the 
 most famous kind of cheese. It comes  
 in both{mild and mature varieties.}It 
 gets its name from Cheddar gorge and  
 the village. Cheddar cheese is not    
 made in Cheddar any longer although   
 there is one small factory at the     
 bottom of the gorge where visitors    
 can see the famous chees being made.  
{How the cheese is made:-}             
 1. fresh milk is pasteurised and a    
 starter of special bacteria is added  
 to sour the milk. Later rennet is     
 added. 2. solid curds and liquid whey 
 are formed the whey being drained off.
 3. the curd is chopped and salted and 
 then moulded and pressed to remove any
 remaining whey. The cheese is then    
 allowed to ripen. The flavour develops
 as the cheese gets older.
