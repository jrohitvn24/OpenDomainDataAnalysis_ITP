 on the northern side of the city of   
 Leicester.Until the 1860s it was a    
 village separate from city.The village
 grew rapidly at the end of the 19th.  
 century and the area is now almost    
 completely built up.Belgrave is now   
 described as a multi-cultural area    
 with a large number of immigrants from
 the New Commonwealth (mainly from the 
 Indian sub-continent).{Thurmaston}is a
 commuter village for Leicester and is 
 barely separate from the city.The long
 straggling main street has now been   
 by-passed.The village is quite        
 industrial.{Barkby Thorpe}is mainly   
 arable land but new housing estates   
 are beginning to infringe.The village 
 of{Humberstone}has now been totally   
 engulfed by the city  and contains a  
 great deal of council  housing.
