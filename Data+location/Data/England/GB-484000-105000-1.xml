		<content>  The  city  of {Chichester,}the county
 town of {West Sussex, }has  grown  up 
 amid the fertile coastal plain between
 the chalk{ South Downs}and the{Channel
{coast. Chichester North}comprises the 
 northern part of the walled city from 
 a line  running  West to East  through
 Crane Street  and the present northern
 limits  of the city  near{ Lavant }and
 Raughmere House.  In  the East  it  is
 bordered  by the  Goodwood Estate &amp; to
 the West by Fishbourne &amp; open country.
 Beyond the city walls is predominantly
 a  residential area  with some  public
 services for  the county. Woodland and
 farmland  have  been  lost, but beyond
 the housing  these  still remain.  The
 farming  is  mostly  arable, cropping 
 cereals. Gravel is  still worked  here
 from  the  coastal plain deposits. The
 River Lavant flows through the area to
 the sea, but  it is now more a stream.</content>
