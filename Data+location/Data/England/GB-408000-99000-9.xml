		<content>{MY PET DRAGON}(Part 2)                
   At midnight I got dressed, went     
 downstairs and walked out of the      
 house. I looked in some bushes and    
 there was the dragon all curled up in 
 a ball. I picked it up and started to 
 carry it home.                        
   Suddenly I heard someone or         
 something say, "Where are you taking  
 me?"                                  
   I looked round but there was no-one 
 there, so I knew it was the little    
 dragon. I took it home but the next   
 thing I knew, it just disappeared and 
 I started to cry. Then the dragon     
 suddenly re-appeared and explained why
 it had to go; because it was only a   
 dream dragon. Then it disappeared into
 thin air and I never saw it again.    
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
