		<content> The island on Belmont Reservoir is    
 home to an ever-increasing flock of   
 Canada Geese during the summer months.
 One pair, some 20 or more years ago   
 arrived, probably attracted by food   
 for domestic fowl; they have          
 multiplied and now number over 100.   
 They nest on the island but tend to   
 feed elsewhere during the day,        
 returning to roost at night, and their
 honking cries can be clearly heard.   
 Also seen on the reservoir or its     
 margins are mallard, teal, coots,     
 moorhen, tufted ducks and shelducks,  
 oyster catchers, heron, ringed        
 plovers, goldeneye, pochard,          
 sandpipers, curlews and gulls         
 sheltering from gales at sea. The     
 moors are the haunt of lapwings,      
 snipe, redshank, crows, rooks,        
 magpies, skylarks, meadowpipits,      
 kestrels and even a pair of wheatears.</content>
