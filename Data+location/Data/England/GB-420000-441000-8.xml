		<content>{Terminal  Building                    
 Because of the Extension to the runway
 the terminal also had to be extended. 
 It was to be done in 3 phases.The     
 first phase was the terminal arrivals 
 area.Phase 2 which is being done now  
 is the spotting and food areas.Phase 3
 has not yet been discussed.           
{If There was a Crash at Yeadon.       
 Fire engines would be first on the    
 scene.Ambulances would not be there as
 quickly because the nearest station   
 is in Menston which is 1 mile away.But
 Leeds and Bradford airport have one   
 just in case of a bad crash. {        
{Yeadon in  the Future.}We hope to get 
 more aircraft,more passengers and     
 spotters.This year its half the world 
 and after that it's the whole WORLD.
