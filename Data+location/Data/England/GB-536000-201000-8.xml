		<content>Families were about the same size as   
today.Some mothers had local jobs .    
Houses had bathrooms inside toilets and
were heated by coal fires.Cooking was  
by gas ovens, and  doing the family    
washing was still a major task. There  
were few household gadgets. Families   
went to church on Sundays. Discipline  
at school was strict. School started   
at 5 years, and ended  at 14. Marks    
were given for conduct, and the cane   
was used. School dinners were horrible.
Food was cheaper, and most was loose or
in tins.Stockings,fresh fruit,sweets,  
and cigarettes and many other items    
were difficult to get in the 2nd world 
war.Food was rationed.Shops were small 
and personal.Public transport was      
cheap. Buses came through Cheshunt,    
and steam trains went to London.       
There were few cars,and roads were     
bumpy.Milk floats were horse-drawn.    </content>
