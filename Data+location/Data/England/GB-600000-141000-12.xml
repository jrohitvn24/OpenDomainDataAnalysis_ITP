		<content>Of an 11 year old girl:                
'I got dressed and went downstairs to  
have my breakfast, a boiled egg and    
toast. My mum asked, "Who are you      
playing with today?"  I said, "With    
Ian because we want to go down to Aunt 
Joan's to see Samantha and Nicola".    
When I had finished the washing up, Ian
and I went and knocked on their door.  
We all went into the garden and did    
handstands and cartwheels. We all then 
went for a walk. We didn't have to go  
in for dinner as we didn't feel like a 
snack. We walked to Broomfield woods   
and looked round for two hours. At four
o'clock we all went in for our tea.    
Samantha and Nicola weren't allowed out
to play after tea so I played until 8  
o'clock. I went to bed.'               
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
