    Megan who lives next door          
 has got a{MOTORISED}Go-Cart. I pay for
 half the petrol because I have half   
 the goes. We drive it on the little   
 field which is at the back of the calf
 shed. We go round our track with      
 speed. Megan is my 12 year old cousin 
 and best friend. I am Ian of          
 Dinglewell Farm, Farlow, Shropshire.  
     The go cart is red and black. It  
 has got a 50cc engine. It is about    
 110cm long and 80cm wide. It has a    
 bucket seat and a black steering      
 wheel. There are two pedals but the   
 brake does not work!
