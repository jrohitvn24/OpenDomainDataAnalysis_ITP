		<content> When I was at school there were no    
 school dinners or school uniform but  
 my mam always made my wear a tunic and
 blouse. I left school when I was      
 fifteen and got a job at duck fleet   
 mill working cotton. I didnt Like my  
 first job but i was really lucky to   
 get it. I had a big family with two   
 sisters, one brother ang goodness     
 knows how many pets. My mother was a  
 typical animal lover an we had our own
 goats and chickens, two dogs called   
 Tiboy and Jangle, a cat called        
 mermaid, a Guinea pig called Hariet   
 and my brothers pride and joy was a   
 mangy looking Hegehog called tulip. I 
 can remember when there was no Radio  
 or Television and one of my sons sent 
 away for a kit and he built a Radio   
 himself. If there was anything I could
 change in my whole life I dont think I
 would. I've had a good life.          </content>
