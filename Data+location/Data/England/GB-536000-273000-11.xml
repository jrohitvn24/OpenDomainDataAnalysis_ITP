		<title>11P.C. THOMKINSON</title>
		<content>{P.C. Thomkinson}came to see us today. 
 P.C. means{police Constable.}If you   
 want to be a policeman you have to be 
 5 foot 9\ inches. If you want to be a 
{police-woman}you have to be 5 foot 6\ 
 inches. If there is a{burglary}about  
 ten{police cars}would surround the    
 house and hopefully catch the burglar.
 If you want to be a{policeman}you have
 to go to a training college and you   
 have to take exams about the law.     
 Around{Earith}there are no policemen  
 that carry guns.I asked P.C.          
 Thomkinson if he had ever fought a    
 burglar with a gun. He hadn't. P.C.   
 Thomkinsons car had no siren. I don't 
 know why. P.C. Thomkinson let us have 
 the light on he had a first aid kit   
 for{accidents.}
