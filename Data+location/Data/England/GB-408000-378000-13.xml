 There is {one  shop}in Peak Forest it 
 is a well stocked general shop and    
 also a post office.Most people buy    
 some items there but families with    
 cars often do the majority of their   
 grocery shopping in near by           
 towns,especially Buxton,where         
 supermarkets have a wider range of    
 goods.Milk is regulary delivered to   
 each house and the{milkman}carries    
 other dairy products as well as soft  
 drinks, eggs and potatoes.            
 A{butcher}delivers on a weekly basis  
 and a{mobile greengrocers' van}calls  
 on Wednesdays.Other travelling        
 salesmen call with cleaning materials 
 etc.and farms can purchase tools      
 and equipment from such people.
