		<content> The community includes:the retired,   
 successful middle management,a large  
 group of young skilled people and a   
 few "working class."                  
                                       
 The retired are suspicious of change. 
 They think that their interests are   
 neglected. They fear loneliness and   
 illness.They feel that something      
 should be done to improve             
 conditions,but they are not sure what.
 Middle management people are impatient
 with established ways.They say that   
 they would never run their businesses 
 in the way that the village is        
 organised. They believe in sudden     
 change as long as it follows their    
 views.The young and skilled are       
 disinterested in the shortcomings of  
 the village.They like the life and    
 travel to find their pleasures it     
 fails to provide.                     </content>
