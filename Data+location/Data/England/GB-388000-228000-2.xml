  The{River Swilgate,}a small tributary
 of the River Avon winds its way       
 Northwards from Stoke Orchard towards 
 Tewkesbury. It is a small but         
 troublesome river susceptible to      
{flooding}which like the larger River  
 Avon is a regular annual event. This  
 flooding has caused trouble for many  
 years and was one of the main causes  
 for the death by drowning of so       
 many of Queen Margaret's troops in    
 1471, at the Battle of Tewkesbury.    
  Two{major roads}cross through the    
 area in a North-South direction; the  
 M5 Motorway in the East of the block  
 and the A38 in the West. The only     
 other roads are minor roads connecting
 the three villages and the farms to   
 the A38.
