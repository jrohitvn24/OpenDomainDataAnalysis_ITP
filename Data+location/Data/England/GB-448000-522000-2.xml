		<title>02PORT CLARENCE AND HAVERTON</title>
		<content> The industrial estate of {Port        
{Clarence}derives its name from the    
 Clarence Railway which ran along the{ 
{Tees}opening in 1833.                 
 The estate flourished with the coming 
 of the{Steel Industry}and the erection
 of three blast furnaces and an iron   
 works opened by Bell Bros..The main   
 industry of Port Clarence and its     
 neighbour{Haverton Hill }was,however  
 the production of {salt}one  of the   
 main natural resources of the area.   
 Bell Bros.began borings and combined  
 the production of salt with their     
 iron manufacture.They pumped up liquid
 brine but were able to use the heat   
 from hot slag beneath the salt pans to
 produce dry salt which was used for   
 chemicals and industrial purposes.
