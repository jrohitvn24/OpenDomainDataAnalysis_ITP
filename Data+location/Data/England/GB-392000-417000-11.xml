		<title>11Interviewing Mill Employee 2</title>
		<content>{Cotton was king in our area for many  
{years - in fact,it was the livelihood 
{of most of its inhabitants.Can you    
{remember changes taking place-and how 
{it affected our mills?}The big changes
 took place just after the  war when   
 Fothergill and Harveys started to     
 experiment with different types of    
 material especially glass.That was one
 of the first big moves that they made 
 from cotton.{Why do you think         
{Fothergill and Harveys survived when  
{so many other mills closed down?}     
 Well,very fortunalely,we had some far 
 thinking men, especially Mr Charles   
 Harvey and even Mrs Harvey, could     
 see that cheaper cotton from other    
 countries was begining to arrive so   
 they started looking ahead to see what
 other types of fibres would be useful 
 in the future.That is how Fothergill &amp;
 Harveys have survived up till now.    </content>
