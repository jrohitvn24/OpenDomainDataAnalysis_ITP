		<title>06PARENTS TRANSPORT IN WHITTON</title>
		<content> When we asked "do you own a car?" 24  
 of them did (82%). We were quite      
 surprised to discover that 43% ( 12   
 families)owned more than 1 car.       
 Parents were asked which method of    
 transport they used to get to work. We
 ended up with 5 different modes of    
 transport. These were driving a car,  
 taking a bus, riding a bicycle,       
 catching a train and walking.17       
 mothers were asked and we discovered  
 that 8 went in a car (51%), 3 used the
 bus (18%), 2 used a bicycle (13%)1    
 mother took the train (7%) and 3      
 people walked (21%). We asked the same
 question of 22 fathers and the results
 were as follows: 12 drove to work     
 (54%) 0 fathers used the bus 3 fathers
 rode a bicycle (13%) 4 fathers took   
 the train (16%) 2 fathers walked to   
 work.
