		<content>   The area around Pennington has quite
 a lot of big,old houses.Newlands Manor
 is probably the largest.Much of its   
 estate has been sold and new houses   
 have been built. Several others have  
 become nursing homes.                 
 It is a good place for growing        
 flowers,fruit and vegetables.There are
 several farms and lots of             
 nurseries.Efford,which is an          
 Experimental Horticulture             
 Station,covers a wide area.There is   
 quite a large amount of open space    
 like Pennington Common,Rooke's        
 Gardens,Recreation Grounds and        
 farmland.Most of the roads in this    
 area are country lanes.There are no   
 dual carriage ways.                   
 There are four schools in the area,one
 Primary serving the Milford-on-Sea    
 area,one Infant,one Junior and one    
 Secondary at Pennington.              </content>
