		<content> Thorpe Maternity Hospital is to close 
 next year in February 1986 and the    
 buildings converted into a special    
 unit for the elderly.That was the     
 decision of the Sunderland and health 
 Authority which published its         
 long-awaited report on the future of  
 the small hospital near Easington     
 village. Thorpe hospital has an       
 excellent record and reputation.The 63
 staff employed at the hospital could  
 be transfered to either Sunderland or 
 Hartlepool but eventually,a complete  
 new maternity unit will be developed  
 at Sunderland.An action unit has benn 
 set up and has pledged to battle on   
 for the maternity unit.The committee  
 has taken the acronym BIRTHS.It is    
 preparing a document outlining the    
 case for keeping the maternity        
 services at Thorpe.This will be sent  
 to the Health Minister.               </content>
