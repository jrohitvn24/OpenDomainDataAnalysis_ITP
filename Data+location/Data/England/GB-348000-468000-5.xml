		<title>05HISTORY OF CARNFORTH STATION</title>
		<content> Carnforth station was remodelled  when
 the main lines were electrified. Prior
 to that the station had 6 platforms.  
 Main line platforms for passengers    
 travelling to London and Glasgow and  
 platforms for Leeds and Barrow. The   
 trains 30 years ago were hauled by    
 steam locomotives. In those days      
 more travelled by rail because it was 
 cheaper. The railways were used to    
 convey passengers from industrial     
 towns to seaside resorts. Nearby      
 Morecambe for instance used to accept 
 about 40 special trains each weekend  
 during the holidays. There were up to 
 100 trains daily passing through      
 Carnforth. The station dealt with over
 2000 vehicles daily:coal and coke from
 Yorkshire and Lancashire collieries,  
 steel and iron from West Cumberland   
 and cattle from the Irish boats       
 sailing between Belfast and Heysham.  </content>
