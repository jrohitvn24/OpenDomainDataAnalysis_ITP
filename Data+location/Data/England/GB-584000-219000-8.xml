		<content> There are two sorts of train that     
 go through Kelvedon station, they are 
 diesel and electric driven engines.   
 There are 25 passenger trains going   
 from Kelvedon to London each weekday. 
 At the weekend there are 37 trains .  
 One day I did a survey to count the   
 trains. I started at 5.30 p.m. and    
 finished at 5.50 p.m. The results were
 2 trains on each side, there were     
 three passenger trains and one cargo  
 train which was going to London.      
 The station was opened in about 1835  
 and there are two platforms joined by 
 a footbridge. The station is mainly   
 used by commuters who go to work in   
 Chelmsford and London. There is a     
 large car park where the passengers   
 can keep their cars for the day.
