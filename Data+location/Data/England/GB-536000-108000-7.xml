		<title>07THREE BUILDERS</title>
		<content> My Dad is a self employed builder. He 
 uses a white Ford Transit.  He works  
 in Lewes, Bexhill, Brighton and       
 Burgess Hill.  He can do all types of 
 building, including brick-work,       
 roofing, glazing and tiling           
{My Dad starts by knocking down walls  
{and then helps to re-build them in    
{different places.  Sometimes he works 
{on new houses.  He is working on a    
{cafe conversion at the moment.  Bricks
{are very expensive, that is why       
{building costs a lot to have done.}   
 My Dad works for a firm called        
 Burfoots, which started about 50 years
 ago by Mr. Burfoot. My Dad is the     
 foreman and there are about twenty    
 men that work for the firm.  They work
 in the town and around the area and   
 can do all the different jobs required
 in the building trade.
