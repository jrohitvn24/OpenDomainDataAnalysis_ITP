		<title>10OUR SCHOOL.</title>
		<content> Our school has had lots of plays we   
 have done Cinderella, Snow White,     
 Mother Goose and Aladdin last year we 
 did Jack and the Beanstalk, I was a   
 stage hand and I got all the props    
 ready for the performance. I had to   
 pass the props on to the stage. Next  
 morning we had to tidy the mess up, my
 friend Joanne was a boom operator.    
 Tracy Ellis and Melanie Rennie were in
 the cow, Leanne Champan was the dame, 
 and Stephen Jeffrey was her son Jack. 
 On the 22nd May the choir are singing 
 in a concert at school. I like singing
 in the choir. Each year our school    
 goes to Whitby we have won the shield 
 3 times in the Primary school         
 orchestra class. We play violins,     
 cellos, trebles, tenors, descant      
 recorders, flutes, clarinets, cornets,
 a tenor horn,percussion and xylophone.
