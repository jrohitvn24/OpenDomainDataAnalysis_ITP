		<title>03A Day in my life-1 Morning</title>
		<content>I'm Michelle Tame and I'm ten years    
old. On school days I wake up at about 
7.30am. I get out of bed, get dressed  
and go downstairs for my breakfast of  
cereals, toast and a cup of tea.       
Aterwards I clean my teeth, brush my   
hair and get my bag ready for school.  
At 8.45 I leave the house to walk to   
school where I talk to my friends on   
the playground until 9.00am when the   
bell rings and we go into school. Our  
teacher calls the class register and we
work or read until it is time to go    
into assembly. During assembly we sing 
songs and say prayers and listen to a  
story. Next we go back to class to work
until 10.30am when we go out to play.  
We can buy crisps and play all sorts of
games. We go back in at 10.50 and work 
until 12.00 which is lunchtime. We go  
to wash our hands and get ready to eat.
