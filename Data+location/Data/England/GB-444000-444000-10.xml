		<content>      Most children have cereal        
 particularly cornflakes or weetabix   
 for breakfast. During the week quite a
 few have toast and as many have       
 nothing. On Sunday morning lots of    
 familes have bacon and egg as a treat.
 Nearly everyone has a packed lunch on 
 school days of meat paste, cheese or  
 jam sandwiches because there are no   
 cooked meals available.               
      Sunday again is special because  
 most people have a joint of lamb,     
 pork, beef or a chicken, with         
 vegetables and gravy.  The evening    
 meal for most pupils is a cooked meal 
 with meat or fish.  Quite a few have  
 potato chips with sausages, egg, baked
 beans and bacon all covered in tomato 
 sauce. The most popular drinks are    
 tea, coffee or orange squash. Less    
 milk is drunk than in our parent's    
 day.                                  </content>
