		<title>19TRAFFIC SURVEY</title>
		<content>Our project was a traffic survey at the
junction of the Nantwich Road A52 and  
Church Street,Audley.We did the survey 
on Tuesday 2nd July 1985 at 9.00-9.30, 
12.00-12.30 and 5.00-5.30.             
The total number of cars was more than 
any other type of vehical at all times 
of the day.The least at 9.00-9.30 was  
motor bikes and at 12.00-12.30 and 5.00
-5.30 was buses which was suprising    
becaause we thought they would be used 
for bringing people home from work.    
The total number we counted was 250,201
and 309 in the three sessions.The      
busiest time was 5.00-5.30 when people 
were coming home from work.The quietest
time was when most people were at work.
