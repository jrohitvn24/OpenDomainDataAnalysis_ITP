 Lanchester.It has been open since     
 Easter 1984 and it is a popular venue 
 especially for families .It is owned  
 by Durham County Council . The River  
 Browney and the disused Durham to     
 Consett railway line are main features
 of the site.Brown trout swim in the   
 river and along the railway line many 
 wild flowers grow.There are all kinds 
 of wild life including many species of
 birds and red squirrels.              
  The eight acre site is visited by    
 many people each weekend.Two part-time
 workers are employed to look after it.
 Many children visit the site.Many     
 enjoy sailing or swimming and         
 sometimes there are dingys at Malton. 
 There are life belts there so it is   
 quite safe.
