		<title>05MINSTER ABBEY</title>
		<content>  Minster Abbey,situated in the eastern
 part of Minster,dates back to 674 AD  
 when it was built by Lady Sexburger,  
 queen of Kent.Lady Sexburger,a widow  
 ruled for nearly a decade until her   
 son reached the age of 15,whereupon   
 she abdicated,keeping only a small    
 piece of land in the centre of        
 Sheppey.Upon this land she built,near 
 a Roman temple,the small Benedictine  
 Abbey.It took 30 years to build, with 
 the only labourers being 77 women.The 
 nuns who occupied the Abbey were great
 healers and many of the herbs they    
 used have been proven today.However,  
 the Abbey is not the same as it was,as
 Viking damage was repaired by the     
 Normans using a different stone,and a 
 fire in Elizabeth I's reign caused    
 great destruction.In 1982 the Abbey   
 Gatehouse was opened as a small museum
 for Sheppey artefacts. Laurence Hayes.</content>
