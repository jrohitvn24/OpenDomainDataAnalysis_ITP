		<title>16MY FIRST DAY AT ST. BEDES</title>
		<content> My first day at St. Bedes was a       
 very{nerve racking experience}for me. 
 I was not only changing to another    
 school, but going to a much{bigger}and
{stricter school}as well. At first I   
 was very nervous, but as the day      
 passed I gradually began to get more  
 confident. On this first day we did   
 not have to find the classrooms       
 ourselves because we did not know     
 where they were. So the{teachers}for  
 every lesson came and took us to the  
 next room. In the{lessons}we did not  
 have to work but just listen to       
 the teachers who were telling us about
 the things that we would be doing in  
 the year. The thing I was really      
{worried about}was getting on the coach
 to go back home at 3.30pm, but that   
 turned out alright. When I got home I 
 could not wait to go to school again.
