		<content> 2.   What is the dispute about the car
      park?                            
                                       
 The Park needs money from tourists    
 to continue its work. The authorities 
 have asked for permission to build a  
 car park on Matthew Arnold meadow and 
 the cricket ground. Cobham Cricket    
 Club would have to move elsewhere. The
 Park authorities claim that these     
 areas are the only ones that Surrey   
 County Council will not say 'no'      
 to.Some local people claim that the   
 car park would mean increased noise   
 and loss of the rural atmosphere. At  
 present the dispute is at stalemate.  
                                       
                                       
 Some Feltonfleet School boys have been
 working in the Park: excavating the   
 floor of the Turkish Tent.
