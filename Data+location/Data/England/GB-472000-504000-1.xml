		<title>01Great Fryup Dale and Area</title>
		<content> A block situated in the middle of     
 moorland but disected by three valleys
 tributaries of the Esk, so much of it 
 is lower than the surroundings moors  
 and devoted to farming. The main      
 valley, Great Fry up Dale is mainly   
 devoted to sheep and cattle grazing   
 and the few residents live in a       
 scattering of farms as there are no   
 real villages. There are some         
 woodlands just below the moorlands    
 start and the only activities on the  
 moors are rough sheep grazing and     
 perhaps grouse shooting. The Esk      
 valley is very popular with tourists  
 and Great FryUp Dale, and Glaisdale in
 particular get quite a few visitors.  
 Many people find the scenery          
 particularly attractive for walking.  
 The area is easily accessible by road 
 from Eskdale and from the south.
