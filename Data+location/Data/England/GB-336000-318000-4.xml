		<title>04RAF LIFE IN NESSCLIFFE CONTD</title>
		<content> I have liked living in Nesscliffe     
 because it is a nice Quarter and I    
 like the country.  I will not llike   
 leaving because I will have to go to  
 a different school and I will miss    
 my friends.   I am leaving in         
 July  and I will be in my new         
 school for only a few months before I 
 go to Jordan.                         
{A service wife's life }can sometimes  
 seem tedious - living in a house not  
 your own and always on the move but I 
 sometimes wonder if I could now bear  
 to live in one place for more than 3  
 years which I have  not done for 18yrs
  The prospect of seeing new places    
 and making new friends lessens the    
 sadness of leaving the old. Less      
 trivial, a woman married to a service 
 man cannot have a career unless she is
 prepared tolive apart from him,       
 staying put while he moves on.        </content>
