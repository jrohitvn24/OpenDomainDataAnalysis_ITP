		<title>06WORKING AS AN AIR HOSTESS</title>
		<content>  I am 22 yrs old and work as an{Air   
{Hostess}with Dan Air Services. I work 
 approx 37 hrs a week averaging 6-9 hrs
 per flight on BAC 1-11 and Boeing 727 
 aeroplanes, which carry approx 100    
 passengers to Europe and as far as    
 Israel. I have a temporary contract at
 present. I am supplied with a wardrobe
 of uniform and must look smart. I     
 serve passengers with food and drink  
 and sell duty free goods. I am trained
 for aeroplane emergencies and first   
 aid, and meet many interesting people.
 Physically 1 hrs work aboard plane is 
 equivalent to 2 hrs on the ground and 
 my feet and stomach swell under air   
 craft pressure. I rent a house in     
 Horley which is near Gatwick Airport. 
 I own a car and drive to work. I wish 
 to carry on working for 2 more years  
 as a permanent employee.
