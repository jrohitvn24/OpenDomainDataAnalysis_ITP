		<content> Treloweth Farm St.Erth.               
      The farmer owns a complete set of
 annuals concerned with the family     
 histories of Guernsey cattle going    
 back to the last century, each cow is 
 numbered and named based on l6 names  
 e.g.Harebell lOO.                     
      Fields not being used by the     
 cattle are used to grow food for the  
 animals in the winter time,for        
 instance stubble turnip where the     
 cattle are allowed no more than 2O    
 minutes "strip grazing" per day. Owing
 to the fact that it is very high in   
 protein, also kale is grown.          
      Only one herdsman is employed    
 with the milking taking place twice   
 daily in an 8x8 2 level abreast       
 milking parlour.                      
      Shooting pheasant is a sport in  
 the area and young pheasant are reared
 on the farm from eggs.                </content>
