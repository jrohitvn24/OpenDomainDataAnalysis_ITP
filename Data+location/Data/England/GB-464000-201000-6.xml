		<content>  We watched the builders and thatchers
at work on the last house in Latchford 
Lane and then we walked up the lane    
counting the buildings.We counted 38   
houses and bungalows before we reached 
the Church.We saw the Manor House and  
Manor Stables (now a house) and then   
came to Thame Road.                    
  The first house was once a shop and  
Lady Taylor's house used to be         
"The Crown" Public House.Around the    
corner into Rectory Road we saw the old
Smithy,the forge and horses still      
there.Next door was the shop and       
bakery,now closed.                     
  We looked at Church Farm House with  
its painted imitation window and then  
saw the Granary at the Farm.The Old    
Rectory is next to the Village         
Hall,formerly Glebe Farm's Barn.Dames  
Bank was once a pub,The Six Bells.
