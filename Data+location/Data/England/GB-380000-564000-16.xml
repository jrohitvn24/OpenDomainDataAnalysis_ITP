		<title>16LORD ELLIOTT OF MORPETH</title>
		<content> Lord Elliott lives at{Lipwood Hall.}He
 writes of it:                         
 "It is a happy place with its Georgian
 facade,its walled garden,its meadows  
 which abound in summertime with herbs 
 &amp; old grasses. I love the trees of    
 Lipwood,central of which is a copper  
 beech,magnificent at this time in its 
 summer foliage.Lipwood charms,soothes 
 it smiles for me each time I return   
 from London.It was my privilege for   
 some years to serve in the{House of   
{Commons}as an M.P.This stemmed from an
 inborn interest in public affairs, and
 a desire to be involved in them.It was
 so good to serve{Newcastle-upon-Tyne  
 to know its people,its problems,its   
 institutions &amp; to take some part in   
 its modern development.Now,as a Member
 of the{House of Lords,}my service     
 continues &amp; I shall do my best to     
 justify the confidence placed in me." </content>
