		<title>17CONSERVATION IN MAPPERLEY</title>
		<content> On Sherwood Vale some people from the 
 British Trust for Conservation        
 Volunteers are working on an old      
 railway embankment and are cutting    
 down sycamores and planting native    
 species.Before,people used it for a   
 dump-children made dens in it and used
 it as a scrambling course for         
 motorbikes and there was graffiti on  
 the bridge walls.In 1983 the          
 conservation volunteers started work  
 on it,and hope to finish in 1985.They 
 are making a nature area to attract   
 butterflies,birds and other wildlife. 
 The Scouts help on Saturdays and      
 Sundays.They are making a wetland area
 for water wildlife.They are making a  
 path for people to enjoy it.The       
 residents are now happy about the     
 scheme as it improves the area.       
                Mark Ellis,Paul Duflot.
