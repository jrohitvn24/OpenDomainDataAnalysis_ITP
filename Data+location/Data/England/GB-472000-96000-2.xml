		<content> Many old peoples attitudes towards    
 teenagers are reasonably good.They are
 quite polite to us &amp; we are to them   
 usually , but some think we are all   
 drug takers &amp; muggers.Reconstruction  
 of the beach from Eastoke to Sandy    
 Point has aroused many different      
 attitudes, the majority of people     
 living in that area are against it. A 
 committee of trackers &amp; residents has 
 been formed to fight the local        
 councils policy. The problem is the   
 council promised a Sandy beach, what  
 has happened is that all the stones   
 are very large &amp; jagged. The sand     
 surrounding them looks like mud &amp; has 
 covered over all the golden sand. The 
 Â£4\ million scheme is to stop severe  
 erosion &amp; winter flooding which has   
 caused residents to complain for      
 years.
