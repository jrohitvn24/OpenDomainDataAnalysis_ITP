		<title>18The Village Pub(2)</title>
		<content>  There are some improvements planned  
for the pub;such as to the kitchen     
which used to be a stable and to the   
beer garden which used to be waste     
land.We now have live music with an    
organ.                                 
  My dad has been in the trade for     
nineteen years.He used to work at the  
Dock Hotel in Liverpool.Before he      
started working in pubs and hotels     
he was a teacher. He taught technology 
and he worked in the building trade.   
  There are quite a lot of country     
village pubs round here. Most of them  
are quite small.There is the Longton   
Arms just up the road. It is in Walmer 
Bridge even though it is called the    
Longton Arms.There is the Smithy Inn   
in Much Hoole and the Golden Ball and  
the Dolphin in Longton.
