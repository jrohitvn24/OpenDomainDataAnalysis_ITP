		<title>11Sunday in Gringley (cont.)</title>
		<content> Mr Sisum says that in the summer,     
 Sunday is quite a busy day in the     
 village:people pass by on ponies,some 
 fish in the canal or there might be a 
 special function.Mr Sisum thinks there
 is a good family atmosphere in        
 Gringley. There's a butcher,P.O.&amp;     
 small shop (soon to close down)in the 
 village but they aren't open on       
 Sundays.Mr Sisum likes a day without  
 shops: "No one can pressure you into  
 buying things".He usually does 5-6 Hrs
 of school work:marking exercise books,
 planning Geography &amp; Humanities       
 lessons for the week ahead,completing 
 administrative tasks for the 5th &amp; 7th
 years' public examinations.Mr Sisum   
 is glad he lives in Gringley and he   
 wouldn't wish to change it.           
{Mr Sisum had a tape-recorded          
{interview with four 12yr olds in June 
{1985. }                               </content>
