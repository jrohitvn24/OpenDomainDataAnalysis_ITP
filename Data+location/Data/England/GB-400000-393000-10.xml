		<content> Since 1970 there has been a definite  
 move towards{unity}amongst the        
 different{Christian}groups. There is a
 greater{sharing of ideas}and a lot    
 more{willingness to help}each other.  
 People no-longer ask about the        
 denomination to which they belong but 
 'Are you a fellow Christian?' People  
 are tired of disunity and long for{   
{togetherness.}The Vicar of St. Luke's 
 told us of a joint visit to Sheffield 
 to hear{Dr. Billy Graham.}When asked  
 how far young people are involved in  
 the church he said, 'I would like to  
 see them more involved in the         
 community as they are not really      
 taking part.' Altogether there are 22 
 churches in our area belonging to the 
 CofE,RC,Methodist,Baptist,Pentecostal,
 and Spiritualist churches. Although   
 there are a few followers of{other    
{faiths}they have no meeting places.   </content>
