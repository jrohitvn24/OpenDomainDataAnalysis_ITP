 Last year between{13-14 Thousand      
 people came from all over England,    
 Scotland and Wales to take part in the
 show.                                 
                                       
 It was founded in{1876}and always     
 takes place on the third Wednesday in 
 August. It was started as a horse show
 since Egton was a Market Village. The 
 show is run by the people of{Egton}who
 organise the refreshments and steward 
 the classes for the animals.          
                                       
 I love going to the show and always   
 look for the doctor's caravan because 
 my father uses it as a base.This year 
 (1985) the show is running a{"Warm -  
{Aid"}event, knitting vests for the    
 Ethiopian children.
