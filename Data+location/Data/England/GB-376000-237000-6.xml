		<title>06Midsummer Hill Hill Fort</title>
		<content> This is one of three{pre-historic hill
{forts}on the Malvern Hills, the others
 being at the Worcestershire and the   
 Herefordshire Beacons.  The Iron-age  
 camp on Midsummer hill was excavated  
 between 1966 and 1970 by Birmingham   
 University.  The excavations showed   
 that the camp was probably built in   
 the 2nd century B.C. and occupied for 
 a long time.  A mile of double-ditched
 stone-capped ramparts enclosed about  
 30 acres with a large single-walled   
 stock enclosure outside.  Evidence of 
 square huts and timber framed         
 buildings were found and, at times,   
 the population may have been 800.     
 There is spring water within the main 
 camp.  Unlike most of the Malvern     
 Hills this area is now wooded.
