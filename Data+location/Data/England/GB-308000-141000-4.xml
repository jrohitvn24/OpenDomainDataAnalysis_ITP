		<content>    Mr Gibbons who farms{Staple Farm  }
 likes to ride round his farm on       
{horseback}whenever he can. He says    
 that you can see much more from the   
 back of a horse than you can from a   
 land rover or a tractor.              
    He is a keen{conservationist}and   
 being anxious to{preserve plants}and  
{wildlife for future generations.}He   
 has{planted over 2,000 tress}since    
 l976. There are at least nine areas on
 Staple Farm that have been carefully  
 replanted.                            
    A wide{variety of trees}have been  
 used including Oak, Ash, Chestnut and 
 Sycamore.  These have often been      
 underplanted with a{Shrub Layer}of    
 Holly Snowberry, Spindle, and Dogwood.
   In other corners of the farm areas  
{have been left to go wild}to encourage
 wild flowers and butterflies to come  
 back into the farmland.               </content>
