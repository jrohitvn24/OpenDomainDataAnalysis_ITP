		<content>    My Uncle Tim's house is called     
 Badgers Bend. It is on the dismantled 
 railway. It used to be the{station.   
    Where the train used to stop there 
 is a long greenhouse and the{platform 
 is grass land. It is very big.        
    The Freshwater, Yarmouth and       
 Newport Railway opened a time for     
 goods in{1888}and for passengers in   
{1889.}Terrier No.3,  No.13,           
 Carisbrooke and No.30 Shorwell were   
 some of the steam locomotives on this 
 line.                                 
     The line was{closed}by British    
 Rail in {1953.}The dismantled         
 railway in easily recognisabile in    
 late  spring for the white hawthorn   
 blossom along its  hedges.
