		<content>   The cost of living in this area is  
 considered to be high with the cost of
 housing being among the highest in the
 country.The local paper reports that  
 in the first six months of 1985 the   
 cost of housing has risen 6.3% and    
 that from now on they expect an annual
 increase of around 6%. On average a   
 semi detatched three bedroomed home   
 would cost Â£45000+ and a detached     
 house at least Â£75000.Most families   
 seem to have two cars. A small family 
 car would cost approx Â£2000+ and a    
 larger car Â£4000+.Children generally  
 wear some sort of school uniform to   
 school and a winter outfit of skirt,  
 shirt,and outdoor coat for a girl     
 would cost approx Â£31, and leather    
 shoes for boys or girls at least      
 another Â£12.Bus and train fares into  
 Maidenhead cost about 50p, and petrol 
 costs around 40p per litre.           </content>
