		<title>11INDUSTRIES IN BRENTWOOD</title>
		<content>   Brentwood's industries are mainly   
 light. There are no large heavy       
 industries. Most people commute to    
 London.The industries which are here  
 are a{sign-making}industry which has  
 been in Brentwood for{36 years}and is 
 a{two man}business. A larger industry 
 is the {vacuum flask} factory which   
 employs{200-300 people}and has been in
 Brentwood for{31 years}.These are both
 in the Ongar Road.                    
   Also along the Ongar Road is an     
 industrial estate which deals with {  
{kitchens, electrical and Heraeus      
{equipment and packing.}All these      
 people said that they thought         
 Brentwood is a fairly good place for  
 Industry and has improved by the M25  
 connection. {Berger Paints}employs{54 
{people}and has been here for{2 years}.
   As Brentwood is near to London and  
 has the M25 it has room for expansion.</content>
