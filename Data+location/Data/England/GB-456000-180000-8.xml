      Goring and Streatley{Golf Club}  
 was started in 1890. There is only    
 about 45cms of top soil with flints   
 and chalk below. As it is chalk the   
 soil drains well.                     
      Now the{golf club}is about 150   
 acres and there are 740 members. The  
 youngest members are children aged 10 
 and the oldest members are 82.        
      The joining fee is around Â£400   
 and there is an annual subscription of
 Â£206.75.                              
      Every morning men come to mow and
 fertilize the grass. There are 18     
 labourers who use 2 tractors and 3    
 mowing machines costing about Â£11000  
 each.The club is open all year round  
 except  when there are floods or the  
 ground is covered with ice and snow.{
