		<content> ALL SAINTS' CHURCH-EAST HANNINGFIELD  
 The original church, the site of which
 lies about a mile to the south of the 
 village, may have been founded in the 
 reign of King Canute about 1017-35.   
 The church was entirely destroyed by  
 fire on Sunday,31st December 1883. The
 communion plate and parish records    
 were rescued and are on display in the
 new church.  The new church was built 
 in the village in 1884-85.  The       
 foundation stone was laid on the 16th 
 July 1884 and was re-dedicated on the 
 6th June 1885 - the church therefore  
 being 100 years old this year.  It is 
 composed of brick core rendered with  
 lime set plaster, faced with stone and
 rag stone flints and has a timber     
 steeple.
