		<title>04CLOPTONS RENTED HOUSING</title>
		<content> In Clopton and the surrounding area   
 there are quite a few rented          
 properties. Some are leased to        
 American USAF personnel who are       
 stationed at RAF Bentwaters or        
 Woodbridge. These are short term      
 leases of perhaps 2 or 3 years and are
 ideal for the families because of the 
 close proximity to the bases. The     
 American people enjoy being involved  
 in the local community and mixing with
 the village people.                   
 Other properties are rented out as    
 holiday homes or weekend accomadation.
