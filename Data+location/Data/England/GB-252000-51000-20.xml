		<title>20Church &amp; Chapel, Elburton</title>
		<content> The Methodist Chapel is situated in   
 the village. The foundation stone was 
 laid in 1869. As you go into the      
 chapel there is a vestry and a creche 
 for the under 3 year olds. The chapel 
 will seat about 110 people. The       
 renovated chapel and the new vestry   
 were opened on Saturday, December     
 5th,1931. The chapel is now raising   
 funds for another extension which will
 seat 60  more people.                 
 St Matthews church, Elburton is       
 situated roughly opposite the school. 
 St Matthews church was built in 1922. 
 Before the church was built there was 
 an orchard on the site. The church    
 will seat about 350 people. Both      
 churches have halls which are used by 
 community organizations. Unusually the
 Methodist church is older than the    
 Parish church of Elburton.
