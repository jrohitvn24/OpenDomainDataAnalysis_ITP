		<content> 'Ginger' real name Arthur Pinnegar was
 one of the last of a number of        
 'Gentlemen of the road', or tramps,   
 who used to frequent the village of   
 Kennford. He spent a lot of his time  
 on the Treh8ll estate near Kenn. He   
 would work when he could and would    
 rely on a social security pension for 
 his main income. He would help out    
 with grass and hedge trimming when he 
 could, usually unpaid. His home was   
 made from wooden struts and tarpaulin.
 In this he lived through all seasons  
 and it is said that milkmen would     
 deliver him his milk everyday. He was 
 an active man until well into his     
 seventies, when during a harsh winter 
 his health deteriorated. He died in   
 Dawlish Cottage Hospital after a short
 illness. He was buried in the cemetery
 at Kenn churchyard. A villager made a 
 simple wooden cross for his grave.    </content>
