		<title>17A Visit to Ninniss Farm</title>
		<content> Ninniss, in Cornish means secret place
 and it is here, in the{Boscolla Valley
 is a farm typical of this part of the 
 block. On the farm is a livery stables
 where horses are kept by Mrs.Treweek  
 for other horse owners. She looks     
 after 16 horses, feeding and          
 exercising them for their owners who  
 ride them in their leisure time.      
 The horses are used mostly for        
{eventing, dressage, show jumping}and  
{cross-country.}The fields around are  
 used for grazing and growing hay for  
 the horses. Being on a slope, the     
 fields are not much use for anything  
 else. The valley is drained by the    
 River{Kenwyn}which is not more than a 
 stream at this point. Other holdings  
 in the valley are mostly involved     
 with the rearing and exercising of    
 horses.                               
                                       </content>
