		<content>  THE MAIN PART OF OUR SCHOOL WAS BUILT
 112 YEARS AGO IN 1873. IT HAS VERY    
 HIGH WINDOWS SO THE VICTORIAN CHILDREN
 COULD NOT LOOK OUT, AND WE CAN'T      
 EITHER. THE INFANT CLASSROOM, THE     
 LIBRARY, THE OFFICE AND THE KITCHEN   
 ARE IN THE OLD BUIDING. THE JUNIOR    
 CLASSROOM IS MADE OF WOOD AND IT IS   
 20 YEARS OLD. CHILDREN COME TO HALE   
 SCHOOL WHEN THEY ARE NEARLY FIVE  AND 
 STAY UNTIL THEY ARE ELEVEN. THEY GO UP
 TO THE JUNIORS WHEN THEY ARE SEVEN.   
 AT THE MOMENT THERE ARE 20 INFANTS AND
 31 JUNIORS. WE HAVE TWO TEACHERS AND  
 ON FRIDAYS ANOTHER TEACHER COMES FOR  
 THE DAY SO THAT THE HEAD CAN BE IN HER
 OFFICE. WE ALSO HAVE A SECRETARY, A   
 COOK, A KITCHEN HELPER, TWO DINNER    
 LADIES AND A CARETAKER. ALL THE       
 CHILDREN STAY TO LUNCH. ABOUT HALF    
 HAVE COOKED LUNCH AND AND THE REST    
 BRING A PACKED  LUNCH.                </content>
