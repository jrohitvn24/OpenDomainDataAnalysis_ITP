		<content>     Nothing stirs in our house        
 until the time 6.30; this marks the   
 beginning of the day for my dad. After
 getting washed and dressed he wakes me
 at 7.00 approx. and I get washed and  
 dressed.                              
    This is followed by breakfast then 
 we evacuate the house at 8.00, on our 
 way to his working day and my normal  
 school day.                           
    My mum doesn't commute till 9.30 in
 the morning, so 7.30 is still quite   
 early for her, but just the same she  
 gets up.                              
    Nan, the only person left, has the 
 whole morning to herself, while mum's 
 at work. So for her, there's no rush  
 for her to get up.                    
    My dad drives a couple of school   
 friends, and me into West Byfleet, and
 carries on to work; from West Byfleet 
 we walk to school at about 8.15.      </content>
