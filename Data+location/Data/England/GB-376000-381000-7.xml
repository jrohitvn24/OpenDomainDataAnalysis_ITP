 The Rose Queen Festival was begun     
 sixty three years ago when six        
 schoolgirls decided to hold their own 
 "May Day". The Queen was chosen       
 because she was the only girl in the  
 village  whose mother would let her   
 wear her best dress on Saturday. The  
 Festival still takes place on the lst 
 Saturday in June.                     
{MORRIS DANCING.                       
 A new team of Morris Dancers have been
 formed called the Ringheye Morris     
 Troupe. They are a mixed team who wear
 clogs and silver, gold and red        
 costumes. They have revived some of   
 the old customs e.g. Souling (a play  
 which takes place on November 1st).   
 They would also like to revive        
 'Crabbing'(throwing crab-apples at the
 Vicar-locals were known as Mobberley  
 Crabs for this reason).               </content>
