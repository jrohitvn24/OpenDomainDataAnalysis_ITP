		<title>01Description of the Area.</title>
		<content>   There are twelve kilometres which we
 are covering. Most of the land is     
 taken up by farmers, although there   
 are only about four or five farms.    
   The land lies North West of         
 Dorchester, it's surface mainly hilly,
 uneven ground with coniferous woodland
 with a few plantations. The           
 communications are:railways, two major
 roads, the A35 &amp; A37 and also many    
 minor roads.Our area is on the        
 outskirts of Dorchester with parts of 
 Charminster and Bradford Peverell on  
 its boundary.Running through the area 
 is the river Frome.                   
   At the moment the area is unspoilt  
 but soon a bypass will ruin the       
 beautiful environment.It has many     
 Tumuli in and around the area, also a 
 Roman Road.
