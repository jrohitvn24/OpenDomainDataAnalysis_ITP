		<content> The small village of{Frosterley}lies  
 in the heart of Weardale in a deep    
 sided river valley,midway between     
{Wolsingham}and{Stanhope}with the{River
{Wear}to the South of the village.     
 Most of the houses border the{A689}   
 road which runs parellel to the river 
 with small council estates at either  
 end.  On the Southern side of the     
 valley lie the small hamlets of       
{Bollihope, White Kirkley, Hill End}and
{Bridge End.} The area is ringed with  
 old quarries and their spoil heaps,   
 one of which has been worked from     
 Norman times until recently.  Beyond  
 these lie the farmland and above that 
 is wild moorland.  A landmark is the  
 clump of trees on the horizon called  
{Elephant Trees.} It is a popular      
 tourist area.
