		<title>11OVER ALDERLEY SCHOOL</title>
		<content> The old school was built in 1842.It   
 was closed in 1982.It had been open   
 for 140 years.It closed because there 
 were not a lot of children.When the   
 school closed there were 17 pupils    
 There were only 2 full time teachers  
 The Infant room had been added in     
 1867 The kitchen was added much later 
 The school bell was important.It had  
 to call the chilren back from their   
 lunch on the Edge.The school bell was 
 rung from inside the junior class.The 
 door was very big but it had a little 
 door inside called a wicket door.The  
 school today looks shabby and the play
 ground has all moss over it.I think it
 should be made into a news agents.It  
 looks like a library.
