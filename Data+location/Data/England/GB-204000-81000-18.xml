             Once I had  a  golden     
 retriever called Merlin but we had to 
 get rid of him, so we gave him to a   
 friend. Before him I had two cats     
 called Hobby and Misty.They both ran  
 away.Before that I had a grey rabbit  
 called Smokey.He died.But I still have
 two cats called Sandy &amp; Lucy and lots 
 of fish.
