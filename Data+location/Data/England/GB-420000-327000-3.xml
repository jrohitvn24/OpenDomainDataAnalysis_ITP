		<title>03The Stream and Brook Hollows</title>
		<content>                                       
Through Rolleston runs a stream called 
Â£Alderbrook'.It was called that because
there are many Alder trees growing     
along its banks.                       
Last year a silo burst open when it    
fell over,spilling its contents into   
the stream life.After a few weeks the  
stream was drained and refilled with   
fresh water.                           
Earlier this year some workmen came to 
alter the stream.They were making the  
banks safer because they were crumbling
away and the houses were going to fall;
at the same time the stream bed was    
lowered to prevent the flooding of     
previous years.They also built a new   
foot bridge, raillings,and a water     
fall.
