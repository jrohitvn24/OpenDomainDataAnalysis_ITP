		<title>19A Village at Play</title>
		<content> Stibbard is a lively village with much
 of the activity centred around the    
 Drama Group, the Womens'Institute and 
 the Playing Field Committee.  In      
 addition to its regular Play-readings,
 there is a Junior production each     
 spring and a Stibbard Players'        
 production in September.  In July, to 
 raise funds, the same group hold a    
 Social evening.                       
 The Playing Field Committee holds     
 Cricket and Rounders Matches - adults 
 against children - once a year in the 
 Summer, and Indoor Games Evenings in  
 the Village Hall, and this year (1985)
 challenged Great Ryburgh to an 'It's a
 Knockout' competition{(See Photo      
{Section).} There is an annual village 
 Harvest Supper and a W.I. Christmas   
 Party.  Finally, Church and Chapel    
 alike hold fund-raising Fetes, all    
 well supported by the whole village.  </content>
