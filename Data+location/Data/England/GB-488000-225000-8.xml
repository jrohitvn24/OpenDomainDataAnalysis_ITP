		<title>08Farming in Soulbury</title>
		<content>  Farms around Soulbury range from 700 
 acres to 70 acres.They are intensively
 farmed being mostly of Grade 3 heavy  
 clay soil, although there are pockets 
 of sand in the area. Because the soil 
 warms up late in the spring, mainly   
 winter crops are grown. These consist 
 of barley, wheat, oats and rape (an   
 oil seed crop). The planting of rape, 
 so conspicous because of the glowing  
 yellow of the flowers in spring, has  
 increased because the subsidies from  
 the E.E.C. make it such a highly      
 profitable crop.                      
 Because of the vast stocks of wheat   
 and barley in Intervention, local     
 farmers are looking for alternative   
 scources of income. Field beans are   
 occasionally grown but have not done  
 well this year; lupins and borage are 
 a future possibility as an oil crop   
 but are still in their infancy.       </content>
