		<content>    One of our two village pubs is     
 called the Farmer's Arms,and it is run
 by Donnington Ales. They sell about 7 
 barrels of beer a week, that is 126   
 gallons. They sell 200 different sorts
 of drinks including a Henry which is a
 mix of orange juice and lemonade, and 
 a Clementine which is a mix of orange 
 and bitter lemon.                     
    They have games such as darts,     
 skittles,quoits, snooker,dominoes and 
 cards. They do well with customers    
 because they have about 100 people per
 day.                                  
                                       
    The other pub in the village is "Ye
 Old Inne" and it serves many people   
 with good food and drink, just like   
 the "Farmer's Arms".                  
    The pub in Naunton is called "The  
 Black Horse", and the fourth pub in   
 the area is "The Foxhill Inn".        </content>
