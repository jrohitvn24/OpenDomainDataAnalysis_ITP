		<title>13EMPLOYMENT</title>
		<content> There is no industry and local work is
 limited. However, unemployment is low.
 Those working locally are often self- 
 employed, e.g. farmers, shopkeepers,  
 pub landlords etc. During the survey, 
 several people were found to be earn- 
 ing their living from craftwork, e.g. 
 a picture restorer, woodcarver,       
 corn-dolly maker and a blacksmith.    
 Some employment is available on the   
 Bourne Estate and in Gorsley Wood,    
 where there is a sawmill. The Burstead
 Manor Riding School has 19 stables,   
 indoor riding school and outdoor fac- 
 ilities. Horses are kept and trained  
 and riders learn the equestrian arts. 
 It is headquarters of the Canterbury  
 Riding Club. There are a wide range of
 occupations with a small proportion of
 workers commuting to London, the rest 
 travelling to Canterbury, Ashford or  
 other places within easy reach.       </content>
