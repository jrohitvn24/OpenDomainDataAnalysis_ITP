		<content> In our questionnaire we asked the age 
 of the houses. Many of them were very 
 old.Only two or three houses have been
 built in the last ten years in our    
 area. Only 9 houses have been built in
 the last 50 years. Years ago houses   
 were built of stone because there was 
 so much around but then it changed to 
 brick.Nowadays the planners say that  
 brick doesn't look right in our       
 area.To build in stone is costly and  
 so houses are often built in cement   
 blocks and faced in stone or pebble   
 dashed.Most people live in detached   
 houses,but cottages in villages are   
 joined together in rows. There is a   
 trend now to renovate old houses,but a
 few years ago these might have been   
 pulled down and new inferior houses   
 built.The average age of the houses   
 covered in our survey is 148 years.
