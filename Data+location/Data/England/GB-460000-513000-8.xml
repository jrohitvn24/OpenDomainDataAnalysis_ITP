		<title>08A Guisborough Doctor's a.m.</title>
		<content> Dr Galbraith lives in Belmangate in an
 old cottage converted from 3 cottages 
 built by Lord Gisborough for his farm 
 labourers. His radio alarm clock wakes
 him at 7.45 and while getting ready he
 listens to the news on Radio 4. His   
 wife, Jean,prepares his breakfast of  
 cornflakes,toast,marmalade &amp; coffee.  
 At 8.25 he drives in his VW Polo to   
 the surgery in Westgate, next to the  
 library. He picks up the case notes   
 for this morning's patients, goes to  
 his office &amp; presses the buzzer for   
 the 1st patient. There are the usual  
 round of ailments: one man needs his  
 ears syringing; a woman wants a preg- 
 nancy test; a mother brings her       
 daughter with suspected measles. After
 each he writes up his notes. Surgery  
 is over at 12.00. From 12 to 1.00 he  
 calls on the house-bound,e.g. a lady  
 just back after a hip operation.      </content>
