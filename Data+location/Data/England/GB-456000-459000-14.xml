		<title>14MOORLANDS NATURE RESERVE</title>
		<content> The area is very flat and low - lying.
 It consists of nine cultivated fields.
 Of these, five are pasture and grazing
 land, for sheep, horses and cattle.   
 The remaining four are planted with   
 sugar beet, wheat and barley.  The    
 fields are bordered by hedges, mainly 
 if hawthorn with some well established
 tress growing in them.  A small stream
 in a deep ditch runs north - south in 
 the east of the area.  The ditch is   
 overgrown with nettles, plantain, cow 
 parsley, rosebay willow herb and      
 grasses.                              
 The one farm in the area is Hill Moor 
 Farm.  It is situated by a small      
 county road running diagonally from   
 the south east corner of the area.  In
 the south of the area is part of      
 Moorlands Nature Reserve, a wooded    
 area which is open to the public.     
 Electricity pylons cross the area.    </content>
