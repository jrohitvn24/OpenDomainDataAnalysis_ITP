		<title>19ATTITUDES TO FARMING</title>
		<content> In the fields the farmers grow barley,
 corn, wheat, some of this was used for
 milling. They also grow different     
 vegetables eg potatoes,turnips and    
 swedes.                               
 Some people do not like the modern    
 chemicals used for farming. One person
 disliked them because the chemicals   
 were not allowed time to saok into the
 ground before the sheep were put in to
 feed who then got bad mouths. Another 
 person disliked the chemical sprays   
 used by aircraft because they kill    
 more than just the weeds and insects  
 they were intended for.               
 Others do not mind using the chemicals
 although they may have some           
 reservations about them.              
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
