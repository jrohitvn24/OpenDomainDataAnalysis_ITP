In  the  restaurant  there  are   still
cowsheds  which have been  cleaned  and
painted. They have tables in them. Many
customers  can remember when cows  were
in  the pub while beer and snacks  were
served.                                
Above  the  sheds  is  a  part  of  the
restaurant  which before renewal was  a
hayloft.  Part  of the  planned  future
renovation work will be a new flight of
stairs  to  reach  this  part  as   the
present route is awkward for customers.
