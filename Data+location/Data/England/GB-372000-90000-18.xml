		<content>{ 12:}SILVER BIRCH trees have tiny wind
 dispearsed seeds helping them to be   
 early colonisers of bare ground. On   
 the right there are patches of GORSE  
 that has yellow flowers but is        
 dominated by BRAKEN which creates a   
 deep peaty soil as it decays.         
{ 13:}These young OAKS originate from  
 acorns possibly hidden by JAYS. This  
 area is a stage in the succesion from 
 open heath to woodland.               
{ 14:}MATURE OAKS provide a rich food  
 supply  with over 300 species of      
 insect feeding on them, and these in  
 turn attract feeding birds. The VIEW  
 is along the{R.Frome Water Meadows}to 
 the distant skyline of the{Purbeck    
{Hills. }                              
{ 15:}POND and HEATH INFORMATION       
 BOARDS. In the fence near the old oak,
 is a BADGER GATE to prevent the fence 
 being damaged by badgers.             </content>
