		<content> At half-past three we go down to the  
 changing rooms.We get our kit on and  
 we hope that we will win. We go on to 
 the pitch and wait untill the other   
 team comes. We all feel a bit nervous,
 especially when Daneswood School play 
 us.(We lost against them twice and won
 once.) Our goalkeeper does not play   
 very well. Our attack, midfield and   
 defence are good though. Wayne is     
 going to be our goalie next year. We  
 give 'three cheers' to the winning    
 side and wait for Mr.Pilmore to tell  
 us how we did.
