		<content> When the Church Magazine first began  
 losing money, the Parochial Church    
 Council decided to set up an          
 independent all-embracing village     
 magazine. Incorporating the former    
 Church News, it's aim was to provide a
 service to the village with a monthly 
 diary of events, news of the village  
 clubs and groups and articles of      
 general interest. With financial      
 backing from the P.C.C., the Parish   
 Council and advertising revenue from  
 local businesses (1 page cost Â£60     
 p.a.), the 38 page{"Yealmpton Press" }
 was launched on November 1st. 1984 at 
 a price of 15p per copy. The 5-member 
 editorial panel, headed by Mrs Sue    
 Arnold and including the Parish       
 Priest-in-charge, are supported by a  
 committee co-ordinating the Monthly   
 magazine distribution, it's printing, 
 advertising and Village Diary.        </content>
