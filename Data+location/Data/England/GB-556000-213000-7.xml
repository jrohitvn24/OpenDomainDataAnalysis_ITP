		<title>07A Day in the life of Carla 1</title>
		<content> Monday morning is probably my worst   
 morning, as it is difficult to get up 
 after the weekend. I get up at about  
 7.25,I put my school uniform on,have  
 breakfast,have a wash,clean my        
 teeth,brush my hair,sort my school bag
 out,clean my shoes and feed my rabbit.
 At 8.15 I go to school.We have a      
 playtime until 9.00,then we go        
 upstairs to our classroom and work    
 until 10.30,when it is playtime. At   
 10.45 we go back into class and some  
 of the children have a drink of milk. 
 We work again until 12.00 when it's   
 lunchtime.By then I am quite hungry   
 but I have to wait until 12.30 before 
 I can have my lunch. When I leave the 
 dinner hall I go outside to play.     
 Sometimes I look after the rabbits. We
 line up in our classes when it is time
 to go in.
