		<title>06SMALL FARMS, WHITBURN</title>
		<content> Mr.John Holmes who owns{Moor Farm}was 
 too busy to allow us to visit his     
 farm, but he talked to us on the      
 telephone instead. He told us that he 
 has an open day on his farm in July   
 every year, when anyone can go and see
 the milk being bottled.               
 We found out that his small dairy farm
 covers 240 acres, all of it is grazing
 land. It has 230 milking cows and 200 
 rearing stock. The farm has its own   
 bottling machines and milk vans, and  
 they deliver milk, cream and their own
 make of yoghourt to hundreds of houses
 in Whitburn, Boldon, South Shields and
 Sunderland.                           
  Mr.Nichol, who runs{West Hall Farm}  
 nearby, invited us to his much smaller
 farm where he grows mainly cereals and
 turnips to feed his calves in the     
 winter. He said we were the first     
 school to ever visit his farm.        </content>
