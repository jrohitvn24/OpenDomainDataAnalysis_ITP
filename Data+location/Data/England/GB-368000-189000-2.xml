		<content>     Mrs Kimber is an eighty-two year  
 old lady who lives in Cromhall.She    
 remembers a lot about her childhood , 
 especialy about school .The boys and  
 girls would bowl their wooden hoops   
 along the road to school .They would  
 have their hands and shoes inspected. 
     Once Mrs Kimber was caned. She had
 been playing down at Fiddler's Bottom 
 and had'nt heard the bell go and was  
 late back to school. It was only a    
 light tap though.They had fifteen     
 minutes for playtime and had to say   
 grace before meals.The girls did      
 sewing and mending, while the boys    
 looked after a small garden.She       
 remembered enjoying Empire day at     
 school when all the children sang Rule
 Brittania.The Inspector came once a   
 year to look at their books.The       
 children used to get butterflies on   
 that occasion.                        </content>
