		<title>09A CHEESE FIT FOR A QUEEN</title>
		<content>    Cheese making has long been a      
 feature of life in West Pennard. On 28
 June 1839 a very special cheese was   
 made from the milk of 737 cows and was
 to be presented to Queen Victoria from
 the villagers. After long preparation,
 hard work and much celebration a giant
 cheese of half a ton was presented to 
 the Queen in February 1841. Sadly,Her 
 Majesty preferred old cheese and the  
 cheese returned to West Pennard to be 
 kept in an iron cage for its safety.  
 The farmers were so proud of their    
 cheese that it was exhibited in the   
 towns of Somerset. Alas,no-one noticed
 the deterioration of the cheese and it
 became so bad that it could not, after
 all, be presented to the Queen.       
    A similar although more modest     
 project was planned in 1977 when a    
 60lb cheese was made to celebrate the 
 Silver Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II. </content>
