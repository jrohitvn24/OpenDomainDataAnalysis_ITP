 are just to short.At 8.15 a.m. he     
 holds Matins where each day they pray 
 for a different road in the area.In   
 the afternoon he goes on his          
 visits.Tuesday is his day of and he   
 likes to spend an hour each evening   
 with his children.  St.Johns Church   
 was originally built in 1830 so that  
 the people did not have to walk across
 the River Roding Valley to Chigwell.  
 The first church was very small.Cannon
 Hunter beleives that it is mainly     
 middle class people that come to      
 church.The congregation has increased 
 from about 70 to 300.                 </content>
