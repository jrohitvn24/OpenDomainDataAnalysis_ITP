Cars speed past on the road outside.The
sun is shining but by this afternoon it
may well rain.The paper boy posts a    
copy of a national newspaper through   
the front door.It costs 20 pence.      
Later the postman will deliver any     
letters that have been posted.A letter 
takes about 2 days to arrive.It costs  
about 17p.
