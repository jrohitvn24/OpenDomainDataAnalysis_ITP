		<title>13THE POLICE IN WARMINSTER</title>
		<content> 42 Police (39 men, 3 women) are based 
 at Warminster Police Station, built in
 1932. Most of them joined at 18\, and 
 after training they can serve for up  
 to 30 years. The local force has grown
 so much that former Police Houses have
 been turned into Offices. Crime in the
 area is increasing, with up to 452    
 crimes in one 5-month period. Chief   
 Inspector Oram says the biggest local 
 crime problem is burglary, especially 
 thefts from cars at beauty spots like 
 Cley Hill.On evenings from Thursday to
 Saturday, pubs are open later, so more
 people get drunk and there are fights 
 and car accidents, sometimes fatal.   
 There were 4 local murders in 1984,   
 usually due to family quarrels. The   
 most serious recent crime in the town 
 was an IRA bomb planted under a car,  
 and intended to kill soldiers; luckily
 it was found and defused.             </content>
