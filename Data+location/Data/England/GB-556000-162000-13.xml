		<title>13Private rural bus service</title>
		<content> Every day a large{minibus}wends its   
 way{from Romford}in Essex{to Sevenoaks
 in Kent via the{Dartford Tunnel. }Its 
 route takes it through{West Kingsdown.
 Nothing remarkable in that.  Except   
 that this is a{long established route 
 which has always been{operated by a   
{private firm.} Only the liberalising  
 regime of the 1980's has enabled any  
 significant development of private bus
 routes.                               
                                       
 The{operating company}is a{small coach
{hire firm}based on the outskirts of   
{West Kingsdown}and this is the only   
 bus route it operates.  The longevity 
 of the service proves the viability of
 what seems to be a meandering route   
 connecting villages and towns to which
 no particular affinity would appear to
 exist.
