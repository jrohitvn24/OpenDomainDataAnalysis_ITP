		<title>11ADULTS VIEWS OF CUCKFIELD</title>
		<content>  Most of the citizens interviewed     
 lived in Cuckfield for at least 60    
 years. Most still liked living in     
 Cuckfield but didn't think there was  
 much future for Cuckfield the way     
 Cuckfield was going with development  
 and technology.                       
  Particular dates remembered were     
 1945, the end of the war, when all the
 children had street parties and       
 everyone decorated the streets with   
 flags and paper chains. Similar       
 celebrations were remembered for the  
 1953 coronation. When they were young 
 they played with hoops and tops.      
  Most of the interviewed said that    
 children were as well behaved now as  
 they were 20 years ago. Some of the   
 people said that the community spirit 
 had disappeared but Mr. Palmer        
 disagreed and said people had become  
 more friendly.                        </content>
