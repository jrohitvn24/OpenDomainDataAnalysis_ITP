		<content>      {Family life}in our area differs 
 from home to home, but most seem to   
 follow a similar pattern.They tend to 
{get up}each day between 7.am and 8.am 
 and have a very{light breakfast       
 -usually toast and coffee.The{mid-day 
{meal}is eaten at work or school and is
 usually sandwiches and a drink.The    
{evening meal}is usually a hot meal and
 is eaten on their knees in front of   
 the television.The{food}is tinned,    
 frozen or fresh but the fresh food    
 tends to be eaten at weekends when the
{shopping}is first done.Most families  
 have a{fridge}and a{deep freeze}unit  
 so food can be stored for a long      
 period.Every family in our area owns a
 car,a television,a sterio unit,a      
 washing machine and a spin dryer.Some 
 have a vidio machine and a micro-wave 
 oven.Most families work hard to own   
 these{consumer goods}as{necessities.  </content>
