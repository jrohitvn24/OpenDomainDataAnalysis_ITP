		<title>11SHEPHERD'S HOUSE,ROXWELL</title>
		<content>     On the 27th June we went to       
{'Shepherds'}which is near{Skreens     
{Park.}It is the old Shepherd's        
 cottage. It looks very nice from the  
 outside.The owner opened the door and 
 we went in.                           
     Inside the house it was very cool 
 and it had lots of wooden bars across 
 the ceiling. The ceiling was quite    
 low. In the kitchen it looked like an 
 old stable because it had 2 stable    
 doors one leading into the kitchen and
 one going out. His wife does the      
{shopping}at Chelmsford. When we got   
 there she wasn't in. She was shopping 
 for some food for their holiday to    
 Portugal. The owner's best{hobby}is   
 gardening. He has built a swimming    
 pool and a barbecue. At 12.00 they    
 were going to Portugal so we went back
 to the car and said,"Thanks".
