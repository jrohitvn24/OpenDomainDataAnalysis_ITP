		<content>  Newington Grounds Vineyard was       
planted at {Newington Grounds Farm} in 
1977. The owner used Muller Thuigan    
 ines. The wine was known as {Banbury  
{Cross}but in November 1981 the        
vineyard changed hands. The present    
owners produced 1800 bottles of a      
young crisp fruity wine for their      
1983 vintage under the name of         
{'Newington Grounds'}. They are        
expecting about 2000 bottles in 1985.  
 he vineyard has been going 8 years.   
The owners hope to plant another acre  
of land so that they can have some     
more bottles for 1987. The house is    
about 100 years old and is still in    
good condition. In the winter they     
have trouble getting up the track so   
they take their landrover down the     
track and the car everywhere else.
