		<title>08TRADE IN MAWNAN</title>
		<content> Many of Mawnan's{shopkeepers}have     
 moved here from different parts of the
 country because they thought it had a 
 lot to offer. Only one person was born
 here. To make a good living the shops 
 have to sell a wide range of goods to 
 attract a variety of customers. The   
 number of shops has grown from 3 ( a  
 grocers, Post Office and a butchers to
 12 shops now. The building of the     
 square promoted growth in Mawnan which
 is a small thriving shopping centre   
 attracting holiday makers and people  
 who can't get into Falmouth. Most of  
 the older people we interviewed       
 shopped locally but the younger ones  
 chose Falmouth. The prices in Mawnan  
 are more expensive, but you get a     
 good, friendly service. There are two 
{banks}which are open at various times 
 of the week. An unusual new shop has  
 just opened, it sells handmade lace.  </content>
