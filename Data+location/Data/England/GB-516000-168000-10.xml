 routes.  English taxis are black  but 
 some are other colours.  There is a   
 taxi rank outside kingston station.   
 On the roof of the taxi there is a    
 sign saying {"For hire".}When the taxi
 is taking on passengers the driver    
 turns off the light.  The             
 passengers sit facing one an other.   
 There  is plenty of room.  Inside     
 a whole family can fit together.      
 The price is shown on the meter and   
 is a standard price for each mile.    
 The driver is allowed to charge extra 
 for each person and piece of luggage.

 Gatwick and Â£7 to Heathow Airport.
