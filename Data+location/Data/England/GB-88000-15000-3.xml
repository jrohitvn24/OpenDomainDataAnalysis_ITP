		<content> who throw the petals come first then  
 the guards and then the May Queen.    
 Next comes the attendant. The others  
 come behind. When we get to the       
 chairs the petals are thrown and the  
 May Queen sits on the throne with all 
 the flowers on it.                    
   I was crowned by my Grandad. He made
 a speech.                             
   Then we say the May Day rhyme.      
   We danced Bridge of Athlone,        
 Cicassian Circle,Ocean Wave,          
 Cumberland Square Eight and then the  
 Infants danced Four Around Four.      
   Then we all line up to sing spring  
 songs. Winona and Rima played their   
 recorders to accompany one of the     
 songs.                                
   Last of all we danced three dances  
 around the May Pole. They were        
 Plaiting,Gypsy's Tent,and the Barber's
 Pole.                                 </content>
