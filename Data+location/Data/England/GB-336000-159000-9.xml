		<content>    In 1911 the Board of Education     
 disapproved of the High Street        
 building on grounds of insufficient   
 "sanitary" and "play" arrangements. In
 1912 the County Council proposed      
 building new premises and took over   
 the school in 1923, as the Church of  
 England managers could not provide    
 funds for necessary alterations. The  
 school moved into the present building
 in 1926.                              
    Between 1949 to 1957 the school    
 became a Primary School rather than an
 all age one. Over the last twenty     
 years numbers have increased and      
 mobile classrooms have been added.    
 Technology has come into the school   
 with television, videos and computers.
 The School Log Books dating back to   
 1863 have been microfilmed so that    
 future generations can read about the 
 happenings at Banwell School.         </content>
