		<title>03AVENUE HOUSE</title>
		<content> Along East End Road there lies an     
 imposing white house in landscaped    
 grounds planted with rare trees from  
 all over the world.Known as Avenue    
 House it was purchased in 1874 by     
 Henry C. Stephens,the famous producer 
 of Stephens Ink.The original villa was
 improved bevond recognition,the most  
 noteworthy addition being the working 
 laboratory sited above the drawing-   
 room.Here Inky Stephens experimented  
 with inks and dyes,maintaining contact
 with his domestic staff by            
 telephone.On his death he left the    
 house and gardens to the people of    
 Finchley.It is now part museum part   
 community centre with a superb park.In
 the rooms meet many local             
 organisations.The Scouts meet in the  
 old stable-block,and the gardener's   
 cottage houses the Borough Parks      
 Superintendent.                       </content>
