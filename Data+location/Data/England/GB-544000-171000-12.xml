		<title>12Housing in Sidcup Area.</title>
		<content>   Sidcup is a very built up area.     
 There are vsry few Council Properties 
 as the area is a very wealthy one.    
  {Semi-Detached:}This is the most     
 common type of housing in Sidcup and  
 Bexley. Most of them were built in the
 1930's.                               
{  Detached:}There are very few        
 detached houses in the area. They were
 built either very recently or         
 pre-1930's.                           
{  Terraced:}These are the most common 
 type of house after semi-detached.    
  {Flats:}There are several blocks of  
 flats in the area, most common in     
 Sidcup. More than half the blocks are 
 old peoples flats.                    
{  Bungalows:}These are the least      
 common type of housing. They are all  
 recently built and again the majority 
 are for old people.
