		<title>07LAYER MARNEY TOWERS</title>
		<content> Layer Marney Towers was built in      
 1500 by Lord Henry Marney. It took 20 
 years to build. Lord Henry Marney died
 in 1525. There are 47 rooms in the    
 Tower.It was empty for 17 years before
 the Charringtons moved in. Major      
 Charrington and his family have lived 
 in Layer Marney Towers for 27 years.  
 Major Charrington is a farmer,        
 gardener, magistrate and an elected   
 member of the church. He owns about 6 
 acres of gardens/pastures attached to 
 the tower. He likes living in Layer   
 Marney Towers because of the beautiful
 surroundings. He thinks it's hard work
 and his son will soon take over the   
 running of things. He keeps a herd of 
 Dexter cattle. It's open to the public
 on Thursdays and Sundays. One gardener
 is employed full-time. Major and Mrs  
 Charrington live in part of the Towers
 and there are three flats for renting.</content>
