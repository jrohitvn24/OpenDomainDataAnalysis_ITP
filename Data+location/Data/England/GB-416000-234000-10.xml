		<title>10Blockley Mills</title>
		<content> Mr Cooks house used to be a corn mill 
 in 1923.The mill was run by a wheel   
 which ran on water.The water would run
 on the wheel and make it turn.        
        The water came from Blockley   
 Brook.The mill was converted into a   
 house in 1926 by a Mr Woodsy.He sold  
 it to Mr Cooks father in 1931 and Mr  
 Cook got it in 1960.                  
        There are many signs of a mill 
 but the best ones are the mill stones.
        The mill stopped working in    
 1937.                                 
        At one time there were 15 fully
 working mills in Blockley. This is    
 because there are so many underground 
 springs which were used to drive the  
 mills.                                
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
