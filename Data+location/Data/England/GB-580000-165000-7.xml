		<title>07COMMUTING:AFFECTS ON PEOPLE.</title>
		<content>In many cases people working in        
London offices leave between 6.30 and  
7.00am.  Most people travel by train   
after walking to the station.  A large 
proportion of the local residential    
estates are filled with  commuters many
of whom moved out from London to Kent  
in the 1960's and 1970's when many of  
the newer houses were built.  A journey
can take upto 1.5 hours.  People finish
work between 4.30 and 7.00pm, with the 
majority of people returning after     
6.00pm.  Days so dominated by travel   
leave workers only a small amount of   
time in the evening because of their   
late arrival home.  Many cannot see    
their children as much as they would   
like with spare time only at the       
weekends.  Danger from stress illness  
is always a possibility.  Rainham is on
of the chief commuter stations in Kent 
and therefore affects local traffic./  </content>
