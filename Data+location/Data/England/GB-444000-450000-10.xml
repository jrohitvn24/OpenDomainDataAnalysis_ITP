{Bilton-in-Ainsty,}Mr Pick keeps       
 80 steers and some poultry. The steers
 graze on pasture land in summer and in
 winter are kept in a large ventilated 
 shed. Straw is spread on the floor.   
 When they are cleaned out the manure  
 is spread on the fields as fertiliser.
   In the winter the steers eat silage 
 which is grass that has been cut and  
 stored while wet and green. The silage
 is stored in large piles and wrapped  
 in polythene.                         
   The concentrated juices of the grass
 seep from the silage and are collected
 in lagoons. This liquid must not enter
 the drains. The lagoon is emptied over
 the manure heap and so eventually     
 finds its way back to the land.
