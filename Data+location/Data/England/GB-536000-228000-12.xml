		<content>  For Remembrance Sunday in November,  
 the Cubs, Scouts, Guides and Brownies 
 march with other bodies through       
 Buntingford to St. Peter's Church  for
 a service. Outside, a wreath of       
 poppies is laid at the cross to       
 remember all the people who died in   
 the World Wars.                       
                                       
 Open Air service at Layston           
                                       
 Once a year there is an open air      
 service at Layston Church.  Sometimes,
 children take their pets along, like  
 cats, dogs, guinea pigs, rabbits,     
 pigs, etc.  They are blessed by the   
 Rev. Moore.                           
                                       
 Layston Church is in need of complete 
 rebuilding before it can be used for  
 services.  The Friends of Layston     
 raise money for its repair.           </content>
