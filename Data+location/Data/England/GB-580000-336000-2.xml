		<content> For gently rolling country in a region
 of intensive agriculture the area     
 surveyed has suffered surprisingly    
 little from hedge removal.  Hedges are
 nowhere high, three to five feet is   
 typical, but they still divide fields 
 as well as forming road boundaries.   
 Stanhoe has lost many large elms but  
 other trees have been planted to      
 replace them notably around the       
 village pond (correctly East Mere)    
 where an effort has been made to use  
 only native shrubs and trees.  The    
 local building material is flint, and 
 this together with red brick corners  
 and pantiles gives a distinctive      
 colouring to the village.  The largest
 secular building is a fine red brick  
 barn of the 1720s still in active use 
 and housing a corn dryer.  Stanhoe    
 Hall of 1702 is a lovely red brick    
 house designed by Henry Bell of Lynn. </content>
