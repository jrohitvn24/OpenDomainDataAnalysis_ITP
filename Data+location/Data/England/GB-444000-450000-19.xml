		<content>   Auction for Ethiopia held in        
 Tockwith Village Hall.                
   In the last year the focus of the   
 world's attention has been the famine 
 in East Africa caused mainly by       
 droughts in successive years.         
   4 local people, members of Tockwith 
 Church, decided to organize an auction
 to raise money for the starving people
 of Ethiopia.                          
   The auction was advertised on local 
 TV and radio. It was held in the      
 Village Hall on Saturday, 29th.January
 1985. People from all around brought  
 unwanted things, ornaments, bicyles,  
 baby equipment, and furniture etc.    
 The auctioneer was Peter Gibson, a    
 well-known Tockwith resident. About   
 200 people came, some from York and   
 Leeds. The Â£600 which was raised far  
 exceeded expectations. The money was  
 sent to Christian Aid, for Ethiopia.  </content>
