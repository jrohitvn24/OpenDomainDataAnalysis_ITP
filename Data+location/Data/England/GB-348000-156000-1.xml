		<title>01GENERAL VIEW OF OUR D-BLOCK</title>
		<content> Our small village,situated at the     
 north end of the D-Block has an       
 important history, dating back to     
{Roman times.}Later in the 18th century
 the Mendips were important for the    
 large quantities of{teazles}which grew
 here.These were needed for carding the
 local wool from Mendip sheep. Nowadays
 few families work at farming. Many of 
 our parents go out of the village each
 day to work, as far as{Bath, Bristol, 
 or even further.                      
 Most of the land of our D-Block is    
 farmland or rough pasture, where      
 cattle are grazed. The milk is sent   
 away for{cheese making.}We also have  
 one very large herd which gives the   
 milk to be made into{yoghourt}just out
 of the village.                       
 We have walked from one end to the    
 other of our D-Block and we passed    
 only a few houses outside the village.</content>
