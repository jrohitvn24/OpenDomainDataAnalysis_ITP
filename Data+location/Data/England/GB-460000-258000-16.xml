		<title>16 ST. PETER'S PARISH CHURCH</title>
		<content>  The oldest part of St. Peter's       
Church,Weedon Bec dates back to Norman 
times.Much of the building was enlarged
and rebuilt in 1825 to accomodate      
military personnel from the {Royal     
Military Depot}.                       
  We visited our present vicar and     
asked him some questions.{The Revd.D.  
Witchell} has been vicar of Weedon for 
three and a half years and likes his   
job very much.He takes eight services a
week on average.                       
  This is a day in his life:He gets up 
at 07.00 and goes to church at 07.45.  
After breakfast at 09.00 he does his   
correspondence.He has lunch at 13.00   
hours and visits people in the         
afternoon.He goes bell ringing at      
16.45 and goes to bed at 22.00 hours.  
  There is also a {Roman Catholic      
Church} in West Street and a {United   
Reformed Church} in Church Street.     </content>
