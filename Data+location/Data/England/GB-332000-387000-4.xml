		<title>04ALBERT DOCK VILLAGE</title>
		<content> The{Albert Dock,}once the site of the 
 largest bonded warehouse in Europe,   
 was closed in{1970}after being used   
 for over a hundred years. It became   
 derelict and the dock silted up. Many 
 schemes for reopening it were         
 discussed and eventually it was       
 decided to reopen it as a{village     
{community and tourist attraction.}The 
 mud was cleared from the dock so that 
 some boats and small ships could come 
 in. Part of the old warehouses have   
 been converted into{shops, public     
{houses and restaurants.}Other         
 warehouses are being converted into   
 flats . At weekends various           
 entertainers -{bands, singers,        
{jugglers}etc., perform for visitors.  
 The Albert Dock Village is becoming a 
 living community and a great tourist  
 attraction.
