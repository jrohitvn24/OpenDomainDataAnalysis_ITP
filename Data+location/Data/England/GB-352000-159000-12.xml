		<title>12Chew Valley Lake - Nature</title>
		<content> Chew Valley Lake is now the 2nd best  
 Lake in England for birdwatching, app.
{250 species of birds}have been sited. 
 While the birds invariably steal the  
 show, a{colourful array of flowers}in 
 the unimproved meadows and verges     
 along the West side provide further   
 interest for the naturalist. The small
 pond at Herriot's Bridge is now a     
 reserve intended to provide suitable  
 nest sites. In 1982{Bristol Water     
{Works}&amp; the{Avon Wildlife Trust}began 
 funding a scheme which has resulted in
 the formation of small islands within 
 the pool. Ditches have been cleared   
 through the reed-bed providing an{edge
 effect, willow trees have been planted
 and some of the islands have been     
 covered in gravel. Whilst it is likely
 to be another 2 yrs before their full 
 potential as nesting sites is reached,
 hopefully halting decline in breeding.</content>
