		<content> When they are 5, children can go to   
 our village  school near the bungalows
 which have been built in the past 20  
 years. The "old" school, near the     
 church was there for 100 years. but   
 got too small.                        
 The "new" school has been up for 18   
 years and has 4 classes and a hall. In
 the gales of 1978 the hall windows    
 blew in. The Governors rebuilt the    
 whole of the front, putting in a      
 Library and a staff room.The Governors
 and teachers worked every Sunday for  
 nearly a year, helped by prisoners    
 from Cannings Wood jail.              
 The Parents Association raises money  
 by fetes and sponsored walks. The     
 P.T.A. has built a heated outdoor     
 learner pool and provided lots of     
 luxuries and books for the school.    
 After Marldon, most of our children go
 to Totnes Comprehensive School by bus.</content>
