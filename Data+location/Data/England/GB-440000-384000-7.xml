		<content>  The biggest dance craze in the       
 l980's is break dancing.  Breakdancing
 has been in America since l977 when   
 street gangs were very popular. Street
 gangs used to wield crow bars against 
 each other and people used to get     
 killed.                               
 To prevent violence they invented     
 breakdancing.  The different moves in 
 breakdancing have a gallery of        
 names.The main object of breakdancing 
 is to watch your opposition carefully 
 and then try to better his move. The  
 music used is electronic and          
 computerised. We still go about in    
 gangs when we are breakdancing. These 
 gangs are called crews. They compete  
 against other crews. Breakdancing hit 
 Sheffield two years ago.  In          
 Sheffield it provides a chance for the
 youth of the city to keep out of      
 trouble.                              </content>
