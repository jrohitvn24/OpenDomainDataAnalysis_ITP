		<title>11REAL ALE IN RADLEY GREEN</title>
		<content> The most popular drink at the         
 Thatchers Arms is{BITTER}at 69p a     
 pint.It is called{REAL ALE}because it 
 is brewed in the old fashioned way    
 with hops,malt and yeast.It is deliv- 
 ered every Tuesday in wooden barrels. 
 There barrels have to be looked after 
 carefully and not jogged as this dis- 
 turbs the sediment.They must be kept  
 cool and in hot weather draped with   
 wet sacks.The landlord takes a peg out
 2 or 3 days before the beer will be   
 needed to let it breathe.Once opened, 
 the beer only lasts for 4 days.Unopen-
 ed it keeps for 2 weeks.It takes skill
 to make sure there is always beer     
 ready but none wasted.                
 Very few pubs serve real ale now.Most 
 serve a fizzy,less tasty beer from a  
 pressurized metal barrel.It keeps for 
 longer and does not need such care but
 the men here prefer the "real" thing. </content>
