		<content>{Sturston Mill}was knocked down in 1982
 by a company called Nestles at a cost 
 of 5000 pounds.All that is left of the
 mill is a wooden post.The mill was    
 driven by water to grind the wheat    
 into flour and it was made of wood and
 corrugated iron.                      
   The bridge which goes over the river
 is made of stone and was built in 1855
 .The river used to have fish in it but
{Severn Trent Water Authority}poisoned 
 them off.                             
   The farm is being rebuilt and is    
 used for beef farming.They have a new 
 barn which has hay in it.Hens,chickens
 and geese wander around the farm.There
 is grass in the fields and hedges     
 surrounding them.                     
   The date of the farm is not known as
 the deeds have been burnt.Some of the 
 windows on the farm are blocked up and
 stables there are used for storage.   </content>
