		<title>06LIVING ON A FARM IN 1985</title>
		<content> Living on a farm in 1985 is good fun  
 but hard work. The work includes      
 silage making, hay making,feeding the 
 animals, milking cows and ploughing.  
 An average farm is approximately 150  
 acres and about three tractors,and an 
 average herd of cows consists of about
 75. To do hay making the grass is     
 cut by a mower and then scattered by a
 hay bob. It is then left to dry and   
 then set in rows, baled,and kept in a 
 shed for winter food. When silaging,  
 the grass is cut by a mower and then a
 forage harvester picks it up and loads
 it into a trailer to take for storing 
 in the silage pit.The silage, like the
 hay is used for feeding cows and      
 heifers in the winter. From the corn  
 stalks straw is made and used for     
 bedding down the animals.
