		<content>     Buzzacott house is a listed       
 building and is mainly  17th century  
 but part of it dates back to 1615.  It
 is now a guest house with many        
 attractions and amenities in the      
 grounds which are open to the public. 
                                       
     St John's Well at Coulsworthy is  
 mineral spring water which was bottled
 and sold in the 1920- 1930's.   At    
 present it is available in the        
 restaurant at Coulsworthy House and   
 the owners are hoping to re-open the  
 bottling plant and sell it            
 commercially.                         
                                       
      Tattiscombe Manor in, what is    
 now, Trentishoe parish is mentioned in
 the Domesday Book.   Trentishoe Manor 
 is comparatively modern.
