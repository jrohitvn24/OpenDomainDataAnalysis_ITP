		<title>11A SATURDAY IN CALNE - 1985</title>
		<content> On Saturdays I get up and we have our 
 breakfast together. Then I have a wash
 and get dressed. I have to get a paper
 my dad gives me 20p. I get my bike out
 and go to Brown's. We always have our 
 paper from Brown's. I have to get "The
 Sun".Then I do a job for my dad. We   
 are having a wall put up so I put some
 of the bricks out.Then Don and my dad 
 do the wall. Tracey brings the baby   
 over. The baby is called Barry. He is 
 not one yet. I play with him all the  
 time. At about 12 o'clock they go home
 for dinner and we have ours together. 
 At about 1.30 they come back and get  
 on with the work. I play with Barry   
 till 5 o'clock and then I watch T.V.  
 till 10.30.I like detective programmes
 best and comedy shows.We all like the 
 films.My mum likes soap operas like   
 "Coronation Street", "Crosroads"and   
 "Dynasty".                            </content>
