		<content>There was a bad flood in 1953. Some of 
our houses were flooded then. Where    
Langer School has its playing field    
there used to be prefabs put up after  
World War II but after the flood they  
were demolished. In local houses there 
are squeaks in the floor and salt in   
the plaster from the flood. A little   
river behind Langer School used to be  
tidal but since the flood it is closed 
from the sea by a sluice. It is now    
fresh water bordered by reeds. The     
school caretaker has seen kingfishers  
and children find frogspawn, minnows   
and sticklebacks. Langer Park has      
swings, a slide, tunnels and a climbing
frame. It gets very muddy in wet       
weather  because the soil here is not  
sand but clay which does not drain     
properly. A Guy Carnival has been held 
here for the last 12 years on 5th Nov, 
organised by Felixstowe Sports Council.</content>
