		<title>02A DAY IN THE LIFE OF A CHILD</title>
		<content>   In the morning I get up at 7.00am. I
 watch TV until half past then there is
 a mad rush to get the bus to school. I
 spend the day wishing for 3.25pm when 
 school finishes &amp; we all rush home for
 'Sons &amp; Daughters' and children's TV. 
 Over tea my Dad askes me what lessons 
 I had.                                
   Sometimes Nicola calls for me and we
 go up in my bedroom and play records. 
 I have Wham posters all over my walls.
 Otherwise I meet my friend Joanne at  
 Langley Park and we usually walk      
 around or sit on Lane Top steps with  
 some other kids until 9.00pm.         
   By then my mum is in from work so I 
 talk to her for about half an hour    
 then I do my homework and go to bed   
 about 11.00pm.                        
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
