		<content> In 1966 the Railway closed down in    
 Sturminster Newton. We have a bus     
 service which goes to Blandford every 
 day and to Yeovil every Saturday. We  
 have several taxi services here in    
 Sturminster. We have only one general 
 haulage firm here,they are called R   
 and M Shepard. They own two lorries,  
 six trailers and a warehouse.         
 Cardboard and milk powder is stored   
 for St Ivel foods and Cow and Gate.   
 The firm used to go to the Continent  
 but there was not much money in it so 
 they stopped going.An average wage of 
 a lorry driver is about Â£150 a week.  
 Lorry firms work out their bills for  
 the work they do by pence per mile.   
 It is usually about 70 pence per mile.
 To tax a lorry for a year cost's      
 about Â£4,000 a year.
