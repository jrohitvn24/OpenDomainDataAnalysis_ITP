{  __________________________          
  Farming in the Owston area varies    
 from traditional to modern methods.   
 Wheat, barley, oilseed-rape,oats and  
 grass are the main crops grown. Grass 
 is cut from permanent pasture and leys
 to make both silage and hay. After    
 harvest straw is baled: barley for    
 fodder and wheat for bedding. The     
 excess is burned. This is a traditonal
{'beef and sheep'}area. All the farms  
 have cattle, two have sheep, one has  
{40 }dairy cows and another{200        
 free-range chickens.                  
  Beef is produced from such breeds as 
 the Friesian, Hereford, Hereford cross
 Friesian and Charolais. They are at   
 grass throughout the summer and many  
 are housed during the winter.         
  The sheep are Swale crossed with a   
 Blue_faced Leicester ram.             </content>
