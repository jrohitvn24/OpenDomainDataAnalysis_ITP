		<content> Our block is mainly countryside.It is 
 a limestone ridge running through a   
 clay  vale. Farming is intensive, but 
 the fields are small with thick       
 hedgerows.These contain much wildlife.
 There are few trees due to Dutch Elm  
 disease,but there are some hedgerow   
 oaks,and several sizeable deciduous   
 woods(oak,beech,hazel,ash).Small elms 
 are growing again. The river Stour    
 flows slowly through .Some dirty foam 
 at a weir suggests pollution, perhaps 
 silage effluent or sewage.There is a  
 good stock of fish ( pike,chubb,eel,  
 dace,roach )but no trout or salmon.Wet
 lands along the flood plain provide a 
 haven for flora and fauna.Organised   
 syndicate shooting at the Hinton      
 Estate  (1,500 pheasants released each
 year )and rough shooting to the west  
 occurs.Fishing clubs and a bailiff use
 the river.Footpaths cross the block.  </content>
