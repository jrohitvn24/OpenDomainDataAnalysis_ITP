		<title>19LIVE AID the Global Jukebox</title>
		<content>   For the first time in history there 
 was to be a major world-wide pop      
 concert. This was the dream of        
 'Boomtown Rat',{Bob Geldorf,}who with 
{Midge Ure}of Ultravox, masterminded   
 the 1984 Christmas number one hit{Let 
{them know it's Christmas.}All profits 
 from this smash hit went to help      
 starving people in Ethiopia. It was   
 known as the Band Aid record, and     
 everyone involved in its production   
 gave their services for nothing.      
 One summer day in 1985 Live Aid       
 happened all over the world, but      
 especially in the{Wembley Stadium,    
{London}and the{J.F.K. Stadium,        
{Philadelphia.}Nearly every famous pop 
 star took part. It was a magical day  
 which we will never forget. The happy 
 feeling, the music of hopefulness,    
 circled the planet. Over forty million
 pounds have been raised so far.       </content>
