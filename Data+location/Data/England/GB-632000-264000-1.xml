		<title>01Part of The Alde Valley</title>
		<content>  This area is predominantly arable,   
 cereal crops are grown on the higher  
 ground.In this part of the Alde valley
 the River Alde runs right through the 
 block. Low hills rise from flat river 
 meadows which are grazed in summer.   
 There are many mature oak trees in the
 valley and in places old hedges still 
 exist from mediaeval times.Small areas
 of woodland are common; mainly        
 deciduous except conifers where       
 planted for timber.                   
 Most farmhouses and cottages with the 
 exception of small numbers of modern  
 bungalows and council houses, are of  
 traditional Suffolk construction.     
 Timber frame with plaster rendering   
 and pantiled roofs. Agriculture is the
 main occupation. The three villages of
 Bruisyard Cransford and Rendham       
 contain a good proportion of elderly  
 and retired residents                 </content>
