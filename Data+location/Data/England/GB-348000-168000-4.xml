		<content> There are very few events in Flax     
 Bourton. Without the Church or School 
 there would be almost none.The School 
 events that happen every year are the 
 Christmas Party,the school fete,pet   
 show,school sports,small school sports
 and bonfire night.The annual Church   
 events are the Church fete,Christmas  
 Eve party and the Jumble Sale.Some    
 events are not annual like the School 
 teddy bears picnic,the Christmas      
 bazaar.There are quite a few cheese   
 and wine party or barbecue for all    
 the village.Barrow Gurney Church joins
 in all theese events but only Mother  
 Union actually meet at the Church.Flax
 Bourton has not many events through   
 its year.
