		<title>11ST.JOHN THE BAPTIST CHURCH.</title>
		<content> Sharon and Dawn went to see the Rev.  
 Hicks and he told them about the      
 church of St. John the Baptist in     
 Buckhorn Weston. He also preaches at  
 two other churches in the area.       
 The present church building was built 
 about 130years ago.Prior to this      
 building there had been a place of    
 Christian worship on this site since  
 the legend began of Joseph of         
 Arimathea arriving in Glastonbury with
 the crown of thorns.The foundations of
 this early church still exist and now 
 incorporated in the structure of the  
 present church.                       
 Services are held in this church every
 Sunday and on saints' days but there  
 are no evening services. It has a     
 choir and an organist and they        
 practice on Friday nights. There is a 
 regular congregation of 25-30 people.
