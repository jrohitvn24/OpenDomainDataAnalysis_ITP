		<title>13LIVING IN ETON WICK</title>
		<content> My name is{Matthew Tapp.}I am 11 years
 old. I live in a 3 bedroom semi -     
 detached house. Most of my time is    
 taken up with school and Scouts. I am 
 an assistant Patrol Leader and Quarter
 Master Scout.I also hold my Master at 
 Arms badge. I have been involved in   
 Scouting for four years. I find it    
 very interesting as I like outdoor    
 life.                                 
                                       
 On school days I usually get up at    
 quarter past seven. For breakfast I   
 have toast and coffee. I will start   
 getting dressed at half past seven and
 at 8 a.m. I will sit down and watch   
 T.V. until 8.15.  Then I will go round
 for James.                            
                                       
 I like Eton Wick because it has a     
 close community and everything is so  
 near.                                 </content>
