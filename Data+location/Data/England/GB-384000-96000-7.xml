		<title>07   The Village Hall.</title>
		<content>          The Village Hall was built in
 1975. It took a long time to collect  
 the money to pay for it. The old      
 village hall was made of wood but this
 one is made of concrete blocks. It is 
 100 square metres inside and there is 
 room for about 90 people to sit down. 
 There is a car park for 20 cars. There
 is a kitchen and two toilets. A       
 management committee looks after it   
 and there are twelve members from     
 village organisations. The Hall is    
 used for all kinds of things and      
 people can hire it for parties or     
 weddings. Last year it was used 180   
 times. Mrs. Doe is Vice Chairman of   
 the management committee and she told 
 us about it.                          
          Outside the Village Hall is  
 the War Memorial and a large stone    
 that was dug up when the Village Hall 
 was being built.                      </content>
