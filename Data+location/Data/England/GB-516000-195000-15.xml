		<title>15PRESERVATION OF BUILDINGS</title>
		<content> In Theobald Street, Borehamwood, is a 
 group of farm houses listed by the    
 Department of the Environment for     
 preservation as{historic buildings.   
 There is local controversy since the  
 buildings are in a poor state of      
 repair and the Council plans to build 
 homes on the site.{Conservationists   
 are, however, fighting determinedly to
 ensure planning permission is refused.
 The buildings, known to have been     
 mentioned in a will dated{1591,}are   
 centred on a white, stucco-faced brick
 farmhouse built with a hipped roof of 
 Welsh slate between 1800 and 1830.    
 There is also a 16th. or 17th. century
 timber-framed aisled barn, a stable   
 and bothy from the 18th. century, and 
 a timber-framed granary, weather-     
 boarded and again with a hipped slate 
 roof, but unusual in that it is       
 founded on cast-iron straddles.       </content>
