		<title>12BLYTH  HISTORY. (1)</title>
		<content> Blyth is a most beautiful and         
 fascinating place in North            
 Nottinghamshire, situated just off the
 A1. The history goes back to          
 prehistoric times, and Blyth is       
 mentioned in the original Domesday    
 book. In 1088 it was part of the manor
 of Tickhill. The priory is the second 
 largest in Nottinghamshire. For many  
 centuries, it was one of the most     
 important towns in the county, and was
 endowed with fairs, markets and the   
 famous tournament field. Its situation
 on a great highway led to many        
 coaching inns being built; one of     
 them, the Angel, has been there for at
 least 760 years; another was a Post   
 House.
