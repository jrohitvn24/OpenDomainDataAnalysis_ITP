    The Forest Law allows commoners    
 living in certain properties to turn  
 out their pigs for grazing on         
 acorns. The common right of pasture   
 applies to ponies,pigs, donkeys       
 and cattle.                           
 Smugglers.                            
    It is said that the "Royal Oak"    
 Fritham was used by smugglers when    
 "free trade"reached its height in the 
 1700's when duty was so high.         
    In the mid C18th a smuggler        
 called David Smith betrayed his fellow
 smugglers in return for a free pardon 
 promise-some were caught- the         
 others caught Smith at Studley        
 Bottom where his tongue was cut       
 out, he was beaten and hanged on      
 what is now called Deadman's          
 Hill.
