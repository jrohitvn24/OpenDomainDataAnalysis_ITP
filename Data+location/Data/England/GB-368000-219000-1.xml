		<title>01Review of the Longhope Area</title>
		<content> The area under study is rural         
 comprising woodland, farmland and the 
 village communities of Longhope and   
 MayHill.Longhope itself is situated on
 the edge of the Forest of Dean,16km.  
 from Gloucester,11km. from Ross-on-Wye
 and 9km. from Cinderford.Gloucester   
 and Ross are reached on the A40 which 
 serves the area.Cinderford is reached 
 on the A4136 Monmouth road which      
 leaves the A40 at Huntley.The village 
 of Longhope stretches between these   
 roads.                                
{"Longhope"}means a long enclosed      
 valley.The highest point is the summit
 of MayHill,a county landmark with its 
 clump of trees visible for miles      
 around.There are many orchards in the 
 area and the most notable tree is the 
 plum known as the Blaisdon Red.
