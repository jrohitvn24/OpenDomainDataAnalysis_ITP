 Near the centre of the town stands{St.
{Mary's Church},which has some pillars 
 and arches dating back to{Norman      
 times.It has been much altered and    
 extended so that one of its more      
 unusual features is that the north    
 aisle is much larger than the south   
 aisle.Through the Churchyard is       
{Ruskin's View},famous for its         
 spectacular views across the valley of
 the Lune to the fells beyond.It was   
 called the most beautiful view in     
 England by{John Ruskin,the writer,}and
 was the subject of the painting by    
{Turner.}Although high above the Lune, 
 the footpath has caused concern in the
 last few years as part of it has      
 collasped through{erosion.}Expensive  
 remedial work is urgently required.   
 From here the footpath leads to       
 Kearstwick and Home Farm.             </content>
