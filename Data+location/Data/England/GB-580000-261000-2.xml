		<title>02Summer Evening. Samantha 11</title>
		<content>That night I was to join the Girl      
Guides. After having dinner and        
watching television I left the house   
with my friend. Our leader, Mrs. Holden
or Squirrel, welcomed us to the pack.  
Tht evening was something to remember. 
We spent most of the time dashing      
around playing games. As it was hot, we
went up onto the field and played      
rounders. I was put into one of four   
groups. It was called Swallows. The    
other 3 groups were called             
Forget-me-nots, Kingfishers and        
Orchids.                               
After an enjoyable evening I made my   
way home, exhausted.                   
        { BOREDOM - Samantha 11.}      
        Silence                        
        Blank mind                     
        Chewed pencil                  
        Swinging legs                  
        Silence.                       </content>
