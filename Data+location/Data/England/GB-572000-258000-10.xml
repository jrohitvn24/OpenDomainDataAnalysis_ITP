		<title>10The Post Office in Ousden</title>
		<content> The Post Office and general store is  
 probably the hub of village life, kept
 by the Sub Postmistress, the shop     
 keeps all the usual foods including   
 meat, sausages and bacon, fruit and   
 vegetables, greeting cards, medicines 
 and holds a licence for wines and     
 spirits. One need not leave the       
 village at all for shopping. Services 
 also include laundry and dry cleaning,
 for which they are the agents. The    
 owners will also deliver if people are
 unable to get out. The Sub Post Office
 main use is the sale of pastage and   
 saving stamps for television etc, also
 the transactions of pensions, family  
 allowances and the use of Giro Bank   
 services. The letters and parcels for 
 the village are delivered from        
 Newmarket by van, the postman coming  
 twice daily when he also makes collec-
 tions from the post boxes &amp; office.   </content>
