		<title>08THE FORESTRY COMMISSION</title>
		<content> The main landowners, the Forestry     
 Commission, persue an active policy of
 conservation.  Harmful herbicides are 
 not used.  As the forest is run as a  
 commercial concern, large areas of    
 mature trees are necessarily felled at
 any one time. These areas are         
 replanted as soon as possible.  As    
 much dead wood, in the form of        
 branches and roots, is leftbehind to  
 rot naturally.  It is piled into rows 
 to give protection to the newly       
 planted trees and to provide a habitat
 for insect life.
