		<title>17THE JOHN THOMPSON,INGLEBY</title>
		<content> Standing on a slope above the River   
 Trent at Ingleby is a public house    
 called "The John Thomson Inn,"believed
 to be the only pub in the British     
 Isles named after its owner and       
 landlord.The original building is     
 about 500 years old and was a         
 farmhouse until 1969,when it was      
 converted into a public house by John 
 Thompson.It has a fine olde worlde    
 atmosphere and a beautiful            
 garden.People come from miles around  
 to enjoy its facilities.              
 Another attraction is the fact that   
 there is a small brewery on the       
 premises where beer(JTS) and          
 larger(ATS)are brewed.About 11,500    
 litres of beer are brewed there       
 annually.
