		<title>14A Boy's Home Life</title>
		<content> On Saturday I woke up before the rest 
 of my family, which is my mother,     
 father, brother Niclos who is 12 and  
 my brother Matthew who is 14.I go     
 downstairs to meet Burgess(who is our 
 Airedale terrier dog).Everytime he    
 runs up stairs onto my Mum's and Dad's
 bed and wakes them up they tell me    
 off.I have my breakfast which is      
 shreddies, if it is a nice day like it
 usually is.We go out to Brighton,mum  
 buy's things for Matthew and Niclos   
 (my brothers) like clothes,I buy toys 
 and some Dungeons and Dragons lead    
 figures,when I get home and have my   
 lunch then I go to Mark or Nathan's   
 house(these are my friends).By the    
 time I get home I have my dinner which
 is fish and chips,then when I have    
 finished (in other words an hour later
 because I am a slow eater)I go to bed.
