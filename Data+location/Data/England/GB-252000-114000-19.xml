		<title>19BEAFORD METHODIST CHURCH</title>
		<content> The Methodist Church was built in the 
 1820's and was a Church of the Bible  
 Christian movement which began at     
 Shebbear in 1815.  The Beaford        
 Methodist Church became part of the   
 United Methodist connection in 1907.  
   A schoolroom was built on in 1869; a
 small cottage is maintained for the   
 use of the caretaker.  Interior       
 improvements have been made from time 
 to time, but the main building remains
 in its original form.                 
   Beaford Methodist Church belongs to 
 the Hatherleigh Methodist circuit, and
 is served by 2 ministers.  These are  
 assisted by local preachers who often 
 take the Sunday services. At present  
 this church has 33 members; the Sunday
 School has 8 children attending       
 regularly.  Accommodation will seat   
 150 people.
