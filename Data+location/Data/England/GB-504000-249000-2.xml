		<content>  Work started on the electrification  
 of the Bedford-St Pancras-Moorgate    
 line in early 1979. By January 1982   
 the electric service operated to      
 Moorgate, and by May to St Pancras.   
  The{Midland Suburban Electrification 
{Scheme}not only makes commuting       
 quicker but has modernised the route  
 by replacing dated equipment, as the  
 old track layout dated from the days  
 of steam traction. The modernisation  
 has increased the top speed to over   
 100 mph and has reduced the journey   
 time by 15 minutes.                   
  A new interchange at King's Cross    
 brings London closer, so Bedford is   
 now more attractive to commuters.     
 This has resulted in an increase in   
 property value in the surrounding     
 area with old houses modernised and   
 converted to flats.
