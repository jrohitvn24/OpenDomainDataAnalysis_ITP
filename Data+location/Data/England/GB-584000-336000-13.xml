		<content> There is a self-service food store in 
 the village centre, which sells daily 
 news-papers and arranges their        
 delivery in this and the neighbouring 
 village.  The sub post office also    
 stocks some food items and has an     
 agency for a dry-cleaning service.  In
 a room behind the post office is a    
 hair-dressing salon.  The village has 
 one public house which provides bar   
 snacks.  The dis-used school buildings
 house a company manufacturing         
 3-dimensional wooden jig-saw puzzles  
 which are exported world-side.  Other 
 buildings which had been redundant are
 occupied by a firm of craftsmen       
 manufacturing fitted kitchens and pine
 furniture, with occasional art        
 exhibitions by a local artist.  The   
 only other trader in the village is a 
 plumber who employs two men.
