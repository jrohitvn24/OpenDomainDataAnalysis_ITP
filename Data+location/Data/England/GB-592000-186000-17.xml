		<content> THERE ARE 3 PARISH COUNCILS, 1 BOROUGH
 COUNCIL AND 1 DISTRICT COUNCIL IN OUR 
 AREA. OUR COUNTY COUNCIL IS ESSEX.    
 THESE DIFFERENT COUNCILS CONTROL      
 DIFFERENT AREAS AND SERVICES.         
 HOUSING, EDUCATION, ROADS, PUBLIC     
 TRANSPORT, RECREATIONAL FACILITIES,   
 HOMES FOR THE ELDERLY AND STREET      
 CLEANING ARE AMONG THE SERVICES       
 PROVIDED  BY THE COUNTY COUNCIL. THE  
 PARISH COUNCIL DEALS WITH ALLOTMENTS, 
 CEMETRIES, ENTERTAINMENT, STREET      
 LIGHTS, RUBBISH DISPOSAL, PARKS,      
 PARKING AND OTHER OTHER MATTERS WHICH 
 ARE RELEVANT TO ITS PARTICULAR AREA.  
 THE PEOPLE RUNNING A COUNCIL ARE      
 ELECTED BY PEOPLE LIVING IN THE AREA  
 AND THEREFORE REPRESENT THE INTERESTS 
 OF LOCAL RESIDENTS. THE RATES THAT ARE
 PAID BY OUR MUMS AND DADS PAY FOR THE 
 FACILITIES PROVIDED BY COUNCILS.
