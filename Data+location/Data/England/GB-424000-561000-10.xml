		<title>10GATESHEAD METRO STATION</title>
		<content>   The Gateshead Metro Station is an   
 important part of the{integrated      
{passenger transport system}on Tyneside
 which involvles a railway system,     
 buses and ferries. The system was     
 opened in November 1980 by H.M.Queen  
 ElizabethII. The{Gateshead interchange
 is very busy with thousands of{       
{commuters}and{shoppers}passing through
 it and more than{135 buses}every hour.
 Passenger safety is vitally important 
 and we saw for ourselves how efficient
 the system is when 3 fire tenders     
 arrived within{2}minutes of an alarm  
 being sounded. The platforms are more 
 than 90 feet underground and the      
 station was excavated from the site of
 an old sandstone quarry. As the       
 tunnels were being built the engineers
 had to be very careful because they   
 were in an area of unmapped old mine  
 workings.                             </content>
