		<title>12HEALTH IN SALPERTON</title>
		<content> The nearest doctors' surgeries are at 
 Andoversford,Northleach and           
 Bourton-on-the-Water (3.5,6.5 and 7.5 
 miles from Salperton respectively).   
 They are part of two rural practices  
 and the doctors travel many miles to  
 these and other surgeries in the      
 county.Those needing further treatment
 are referred to consultants at        
 Cheltenham and Bourton General        
 Hospitals.There is an ambulance       
 service covering the area,and the     
 North Cotswold Voluntary Help Bureau  
 at Moreton-in-the-Marsh organises a   
 team of voluntary drivers who use     
 their own cars to take patients to    
 hospital appointments,etc,in exchange 
 for running expenses.
