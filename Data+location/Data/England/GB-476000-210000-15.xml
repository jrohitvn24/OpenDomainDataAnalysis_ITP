		<title>15 STONE BYPASS</title>
		<content>                                       
Stone is situated on the A418 The      
Oxford Road. This is the main road     
between Aylesbury and Thame(a          
reasonably large market town ) and     
Oxford (a centre for shopping and      
entertainment).                        
 The A418 is a very busy road with     
heavy transport using it throughout the
day,and much commuter traffic          
travelling along it between the hours  
of 8 and 9 in the morning and 5 and 7  
in the evening.                        
 To relieve the village of this traffic
a by-pass has been proposed. Several   
routes have been suggested and we are  
still waiting for the final decision   
let alone the road.
