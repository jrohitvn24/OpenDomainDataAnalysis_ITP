		<content> Both parishes have Saxon names,in 1086
 they were written Bedingaham-the home 
 of Beda's people-&amp; Hedenaham,Hedena's 
 ham;but earlier peoples are evidenced 
 by Roman Stone Street,the B1332,which 
 runs thro' from Woodton to Halesworth.
 A Bedingham manor &amp; the parish church 
 were owned by the Augustinian canons  
 of Walsingham Priory from C13 to the  
 dissolution of the monasteries.This   
 accounts for the fine church,so large 
 for a small parish &amp; the eponymous    
 nearby Priory Farm.C17 Hedenham Hall  
 was built for the Bedingfields,'Lords 
 of the Manor' &amp; Hedenham's pub owes   
 its name - the Mermaid -to the Garnays
 of Hedenham,whose coat of arms feat-  
 ures that creature.Sexton Wood &amp; near-
 by farmland is crisscrossed by useful 
 concrete roads with loading bays,rel- 
 ics of the 1939-45 war,when the wood  
 was a bomb-store for local airfields. </content>
