		<title>11Landscape Longridge Fell</title>
		<content> The area is dominated by the western  
 end of the Fell, here ranging between 
 130m and 276m above sea level and just
 includes the ever-expanding boundaries
 of the small town of Longridge,       
 encloaching north-eastward on rough   
 fell farm land, mostly sheep and      
 cattle grazing, with some meadowland  
 below in the valley of the river Loud.
                                       
 The landscape is typical of the       
 upland country of the north-west,     
 with its dry-stone walls, disused     
 quarries and water-catchment and has  
 areas of coniferous woodland to the   
 north and eastern sides.   The slopes,
 especially to the south, have some    
 deciduous woodland often following the
 course of a 'beck' or 'clough'        
 draining to the Ribble.
