		<content> FARMING AT SEA ;An industry which has 
 existed for many years is the growing 
 of oysters in the Helford River for   
 distribution to local hotels and to be
 sent to London for sale at            
 Billingsgate fish market.The oyster   
 farm is situated on the river at Port 
 Navas and is owned by Mac Fisheries   
 LTD.It is managed by MR.Len.Hodges who
 has part time workers to assist       
 him.The small oysters are called      
 "spats",and are sent down to the      
 Helford River from farms in           
 Scotland.They are then planted in beds
 in the river and carefully            
 marked.Constant inspection is required
 over the growing time because all     
 sorts of disease can attack the young 
 oyster.When fully grown the oysters   
 are dredged up and placed in cleaning 
 tanks of fresh water for a week before
 being packed fresh for marketing.     </content>
