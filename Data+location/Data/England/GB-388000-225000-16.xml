		<content>  Mrs.Lewis's children help her on the 
 farm.She has two grown up sons,and a  
 daughter still at school.The family   
 are keen on country life.All,used to  
 go fox hunting,however,now the sons   
 try to protect wildlife.Mrs.Lewis and 
 her daughter go fox hunting just for  
 the ride not for the killing.         
  The local entertainment consists of  
 these things:art club,Womens          
 Institute,Young Farmers Club and The  
 Pony Club.The Lewis's have two cars   
 and a trailer in which animals are    
 transported.In the garden there is a  
 large pond which the geese use.       
 Sometimes wild ducks use the pond.    
 Mrs.Lewis has three dogs which bark a 
 lot,but the animals to beware of are  
 the geese,that live on the pond near  
 the house,they are very fierce.
