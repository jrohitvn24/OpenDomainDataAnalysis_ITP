		<title>17WEST OF DRAYCOTT VILLAGE</title>
		<content> Fields either side of the railway     
 showed rough pasture and some cereals 
 growing.One large field  of barley was
 more recently six smaller fields.     
 Hedgerows present as boundaries,and   
 alive with birdlife are now fewer in  
 number.At Bankfield farm medium sized 
 herd of Friesian cattle are kept for  
 dairy farming. The only other produce 
 being the fruit from 60 pear trees in 
 an orchard attached to Melbourne      
 House.Grass for cattle feed grew      
 around pylons taking power cables     
 in all directions.The footpath at the 
 end of Nooning Lane seemed little     
 used, was overgrown,and petered out   
 near Bankfield farm.The busy railway  
 line taking trains to,Derby,          
 Nottingham, London and the North cuts 
 through the square but the nearest    
 station is 4 miles away.
