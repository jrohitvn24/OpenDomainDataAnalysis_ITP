		<title>08RESIDENTS IN BURY &amp; HOUGHTON</title>
		<content> There is a tremendous variety in the  
 occupations of people living in such a
 small area. Many are retired and come 
 from large conurbations looking for a 
 place of quiet together with lovely   
 countryside. Others are working in the
 professions, commuting mainly to      
 London, Brighton or other commercial  
 centres, and have moved into the area 
 comparatively recently over the last  
 25 years. The majority of the other   
 residents were born in the village and
 work at the more traditional          
 activities such as agricultural       
 workers or domestic helpers. Similarly
 there is a great difference in the    
 ages of the parents or grandparents   
 these varying from the early twenties 
 to the late nineties. The older people
 of course have no children living with
 them, but the younger families have an
 average of about 3 children.  (cont..)</content>
