 work at home, &amp; another 1/3{travel}10 
 mls or less to work each day. About   
 1/4 travel 10-15 mls, the distance to 
 the nearest towns. Few travel over 30 
 mls away daily, but some go that far  
 once or twice a week. There is no     
 daily public transport so all journeys
 to work are by car. The occupations of
 these people are very varied, eg.     
 industrial &amp; clerical jobs, medical &amp; 
 social work &amp; teaching.
