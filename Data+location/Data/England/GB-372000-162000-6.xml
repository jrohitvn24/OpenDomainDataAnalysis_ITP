		<title>06ROMAN BATHS</title>
		<content> The Roman Baths are incredibly        
 complete in layout, and are almost    
 the best Roman remains in Britain.    
 This is probably why 926,811 people   
 visited the Roman Baths in the period 
 1984-85.                              
      In the museum you can see        
 some of the mosaics and remains of the
 Roman city that surrounded the Roman  
 Baths, and things that had been       
 thrown into the spring as offerings.  
 The best of all the  things shown, is 
 the gilt- bronze head of the goddess  
 Minerva.The recently excavated Roman  
 Temple Precinct was found under the   
 Pump Rooms.                           
      Many people, in Georgian         
 times, bathed in the Roman spring and 
 drank from it; even now people still  
 do this because they think it's good  
 for their health.
