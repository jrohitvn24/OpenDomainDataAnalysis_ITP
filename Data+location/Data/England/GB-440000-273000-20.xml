		<content> Knightlow Hill is the site of the {   
{Wroth Silver Ceremony} which is held  
 annually to commemorate the payment of
 taxes to the Duke of Buccleuch, the   
 local land owner of the time.  Each of
 the villages in the{Knightlow Hundred}
 has to contribute a nominal sum on the
 11th November each year.  If payment  
 is not forthcoming the {penalty}is to 
 provide a white cow with pink ears and
 a red nose. This is obviously a very  
 difficult task. The village           
 representatives approach the stone    
 before sunrise and walk around it     
 before placing their money into the   
 special{hollowed stone.}After each    
 village has made its payment,         
 breakfast is taken at The Dun Cow     
 Hotel, originally financed by the Duke
 but latterly paid for by the          
 participants. The ceremony has taken  
 place for the last 800 years.         </content>
