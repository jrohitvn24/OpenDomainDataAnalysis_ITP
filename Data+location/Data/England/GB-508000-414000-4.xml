 Mr. Hookham's farm is next to our     
 school. When they built the new school
 it was built in Mr. Hookham's field.  
 Mr. Hookham's father used to cut down 
 the thistles in the field where our   
 new school was built. He was called   
 Harry and he was ninety years old when
 he died. Old Mr. Hookham started our  
 school when he was four years old.    
 Many of the children who started      
 school with him died before Christmas.
 They were only little. Mr. Hookham has
 got one great big barn where he dries 
 the corn after it has been harvested. 
 Then Halmshaw's lorries take it away  
 because they are Corn Merchants.Mr.   
 Hookham's fields go right down to the 
 motorway. He grows sugar beet, wheat  
 and barley. He has a few sheep, some  
 guinea fowl and some peacocks but no  
 cows. Mr. Hookham has a new tractor.  </content>
