		<content>    Every year on {Good Friday }a Pram 
 Race is run along Liverpool Road from 
 The Walmer Bridge Inn to The Mansion  
 House and back to Walmer Bridge.      
 Entrants, who must be over 18 years   
 old, dress as mother and baby, and    
 must drink a pint of beer from each of
 four pubs along the route. There is   
 usually an Easter Bonnet contest and  
 roundabouts and brass bands from      
 Hesketh Bank, Lostock Hall and        
 Eccleston,to entertain the crowds many
 of whom are lining the route of the   
 race.The money raised from the        
 street collection is given to local   
 charities and can amount to hundreds  
 of pounds on a good sunny day.        
    Recently some of the 'babies' have 
 to ride in supermarket trolleys       
 because there is a shortage of strong 
 prams now that Mothers with cars only 
 use baby buggies.                     </content>
