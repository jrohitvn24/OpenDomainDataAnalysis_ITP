		<title>13OLD WATER TOWER REDDITCH</title>
		<content> When the first reservoir was built at 
 Headless Cross in about 1882, a water 
 tower was also built on the same piece
 of land and is called the {"Old       
{Headless Cross Water Tower" }. It was 
 built in red brick in an octagnal     
 shape.It has a weather vane on the    
 roof.It was built solely to supply the
 high level "Ridgeway" area with water.
 It had a capacity of 20,000 gallons.  
 The tower consisted of a wrought iron 
 tank enclosed in the tower, which had 
 a slated roof. The{"Old Headless Cross
{Water Tower"}worked satisfactorily    
 until the late 1950s, when an         
 inspection of the tower revealed that 
 it was in very poor condition.It was  
 decided that a new water tower should 
 be built and from then on no water was
 stored in it,but it still remains an  
 important landmark in 1985.
