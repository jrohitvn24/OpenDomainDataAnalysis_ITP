My Mum helps at play school, which is  
held in the chapel school room.There   
are about 25 to 30 children from 3years
to 4years.It is on Monday, Tuesday,    
Wednesday and Thursday from 9o'clock to
12.30.                                 
First Mum and the playgroup leader put 
out the toys. The children play with   
them until milk time and biscuits.Most 
Mums leave but some stay.After milk    
time they make things from boxes and   
paper, or they paint.                  
Several times a year they have outings.
They have just been to Wicksteed Park  
in Kettering.
