		<title>02Wilton Farm</title>
		<content> One of the farms in{Greater Marlow}is 
{Wilton Farm.}We went to see the farm  
 and Aaron's Dad let us have a ride on 
 his Range Rover. The farm covers 350  
 acres and grows vegetables including  
 sweetcorn, leeks, peas, spring greens 
 cabbages and marrows.                 
                                       
 Forty people work there, with an extra
 twenty taken on in the summer. Kevin's
 Dad works there as a lorry driver. He 
 takes vegetables to markets in London 
 and Bristol. They supply Tesco and    
 Budgens and sell some of the          
 vegetables  in their own farm shop.   
 They have fifteen tractors.           
                                       
 All the fields have names such as the 
 Church Field (where the tithe or tenth
 part was given to the church), Jack's 
 Field, Fern Field and the Old Dung    
 Mine.                                 </content>
