		<title>17Buying and Selling in Rawdon</title>
		<content>  There is no large shopping centre in 
 our D-block,but small local shops are 
 grouped near the junction of Harrogate
 and Leeds road and in Town Street.    
 There is one new hypermarket near the 
 eastern boundary and others within    
 easy reach in all directions.Many     
 residents do much of their shopping in
 larger shopping areas in Yeadon and   
 Horsforth,Bradford and Leeds city     
 centres and Otley open market.Local   
 food shops include bakeries,grocers,  
 green-grocers butchers and farm shop. 
 Hot food is available from 5 fish and 
 chip shops and 2 Chinese takeaways.   
 Non-food shops include postofices,    
 newsagents,clothes,DIY,chemists and   
 many of the small workshops that sell 
 direct to the public.These small      
 factotry shops advertise their goods  
 and services in local papers,magazines
 and through posters in shop windows.  </content>
