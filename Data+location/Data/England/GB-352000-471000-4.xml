		<title>04STARRICKS FARM (CONT)</title>
		<content> After this is done it is put in barns 
 to sweat and dry out, ready for the   
 cows to eat during the winter.In      
 summer the cows eat grass on the      
 pastures. On average a cow can eat    
 ninety bales of hay throughout the    
 winter. At the bottom of the farm     
 there is a railway line with a bridge 
 over it. This bridge makes it quite   
 difficult for large vehicles to pass  
 over because of the sharp bend that   
 leads up to it. Most of the farms that
 are in this area are dairy producing  
 farms. About three of them are in a   
 small valley, but Starricks farm is   
 high up on a hill. From this point you
 can see Inglebourgh, parts of the Lake
 District and on a clear day you can   
 see the lighthouse flashing on Walney 
 Island.
