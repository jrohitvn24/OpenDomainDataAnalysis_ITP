		<title>19ATTITUDES, WARLEY: ANALYSIS</title>
		<content>   The interviews show that the people 
 of Warley generally consider the block
 to be a{pleasant}place to live in:    
 many think that it is friendly, clean 
 and to have good shopping facilities. 
 Many consider that it has some{rural  
 characteristics, responding to the    
 phrases such as parks, green and leafy
 and green belt. Equally, however, it  
 has the{suburban}characteristics of   
 London too: commuting, high car       
 ownership, lots of traffic, high house
 prices and a growing population.  Most
 of these interviews were carried out  
 in a shopping precinct opposite the   
 Ford Offices in Warley, however, and  
 it may be that many of those          
 interviewed also worked there, which  
 could have affected the results: the  
 area may thus appear to be relatively 
 more affluent than it actually is.
