		<title>04The village craft shop</title>
		<content> My Mum owns a shop with her partner   
 and they call it{The Country Shop.}It 
 is located in The Sreet, Chilcompton. 
 The shop has been open for nearly two 
 years. It is a furniture shop mainly, 
 but also sells gifts, cards and local 
 craft work. The shop also sells       
 furniture which is mostly{Victorian   
{Pine.}My Mother and her partner buy   
 old chests of drawers, dressers,      
 cupboards and tables. They then strip 
 off the paintwork in a special tank.  
 They then sand the piece with an      
 electric sander and give it a finish  
 with{beeswax polish.}This gives it a  
 lovely golden colour. Lots of people  
 who live in the village are clever    
 with their hands and make things to   
 sell in the shop. Such things as      
 patchwork cushions, quilts, children's
 clothes, jewellery, paintings and     
 pottery.                              </content>
