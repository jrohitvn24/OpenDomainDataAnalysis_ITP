		<content> In his will of 1729, Matthew Caldbeck 
 bequeathed Â£100 for the education of  
 the poorer children of the parish, but
 it was not until 1749 that the        
 interest from the bequest was used to 
 found a Grammar School in the village.
 In 1880 Parkin Croft was bought from  
 John Bouch Esq. for the building of   
 the present school to educate 175     
 children. Money was raised by public  
 subscription and the school was       
 completed at acost of Â£1095. The      
 school is built in sandstone with a   
 slate roof in the late Victorian      
 style. The original building had three
 classrooms with two porches and       
 outside toilets. A canteen was built  
 in 1951, major internal improvements  
 were carried out in the 1960s and in  
 1976 the new toilet block and         
 cloakroom was built on.
