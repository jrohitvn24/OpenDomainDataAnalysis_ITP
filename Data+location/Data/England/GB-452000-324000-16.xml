		<content> The area is part of the Rushcliffe    
 Parliameentary Constituency.This is a 
 very safe Conservative seat.          
 The local Member of Parliamennt is Mr.
 Kenneth Clarke a member of the present
 cabinet.                              
 There is a strong Conservative        
 Association in the locality.          
 The Nottingham County Council is      
 Labour controlled,but the district of 
 Rushcliffe is Conservative.           
 At the local parish level the         
 Conservatives remain strongly in      
 control.                              
 The local County Councillor is popular
 with people of all particular         
 persuasion and sees her role as a     
 helper of people and not merely a     
 political animal.                     
 A lot of interest is shown in the     
 activities of Parish Councils.
