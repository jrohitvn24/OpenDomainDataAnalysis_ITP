{OffleyHay- Womens Club                
 Recently formed to cater for women in 
the area seeking an alternative to W.I.
Fifteen members meet monthly in the    
Offley Hay village hall. They are      
encouraged to take turns organising    
meetings and be responsible for        
arranging a Speaker or activity. There 
is a wide range of interests and skills
in the local community, among women of 
different ages. It is hoped to         
encourage wives  who tend to lose      
confidence after giving up work, also  
to make use of the village hall.       
{Youth Club}                           
There are also plans to have a Youth   
Club in the village hall to cater for  
the young people in the area.
