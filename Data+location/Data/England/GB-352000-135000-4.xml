		<title>04Dairy Farming</title>
		<content> West Town House is a dairy farm run by
 the same family for almost 100 years. 
 They have a pedigree herd of 185 cows,
 25 in calf at present. They rear their
 own calves in a separate unit. There  
 is one bull with the herd.            
 Each cow gives approximately 500      
 litres of milk per year. All the milk 
 is used to make cheese. Each cow's    
 personal development is monitored by  
 the computer for winter feeding and   
 health purposes.                      
 As the farm is on the edge of the     
 Somerset levels the land has been     
 extensively drained to make it        
 suitable for dairy pasture. There are 
 14 paddocks of about 4 acres each     
 which are used in rotation for 3 feeds
 and then fertilised. Beyond the       
 paddocks are several silage fields.
