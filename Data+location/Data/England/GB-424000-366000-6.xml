 There is only one village in our      
 block. It is called Beeley. In Beeley 
 there is a house called the Norman    
 House. The fields around are mostly   
 farmlands. There are quite a few      
 woodlands as well.                    
 Our block starts on an old railway and
 one of the edges is Chatsworth weir.  
 We had our dinner on Chatsworth. Then 
 we went in a private wood, the trees  
 in this wood were deciduous trees. We 
 went through somebodys garden because 
 a man had let us. We went through some
 fields. There was a field of mud where
 they had been ploughing the field. We 
 went through another wood which was   
 also deciduous trees.There is a wood  
 in our block it is called Smeltingmill
 Wood.It has got massive walls in it   
 they could be hundreds of years old We
  found out it is also a quarry....... </content>
