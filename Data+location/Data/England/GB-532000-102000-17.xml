		<title>17THE PROBLEM OF LONELINESS</title>
		<content> Though many people think of seaside   
 towns are very lively places there is 
 a great problem in our area of people 
 being lonely. In the whole of the     
 Brighton area l8,OOO people live      
 alone. Especially in the Kemptown and 
 Queen's Park areas there are many     
 small flats &amp; bedsitters. Many old    
 people who live there are afraid of   
 vandalism and of going out alone at   
 night. The local director of Age      
 Concern said "Pensioners leave family 
 and friends to retire to the coast.But
 when one partner dies,the other is    
 left alone for good."  Our survey     
 found that there is a lack of         
 facilities for such people and not    
 enough day centres. Our school visits 
 old people but there is a lot to be   
 done and the problem is growing.      
                                       
                                       </content>
