		<content> People use their leisure time in lots 
 of different ways. Some people play   
 football, others play tennis, golf and
 snooker, which has become very popular
 because it has been shown a lot on    
 T.V. Other popular leisure time       
 activities are: Gymnastics,           
 Show-Jumping, Riding BMX bikes,       
 swimming and going to the cinema or   
 theatre. People who enjoy going to the
 cinema or theatre usually have to go  
 to Bath, Bristol or Frome, because    
 there is no permanent cinema or       
 theatre in Trowbridge. Many children  
 belong to clubs such as Cubs,         
 Brownies, Scouts or Guides.
