		<content>  Only  a  few people come to this area
 for holidays. People in our area often
 go abroad. Some may  fly  from  nearby
{HEATHROW}  Airport,  which  is also in
 Hillingdon.                           
                                       
 For example,                          
                                       
           {Holidays in 1985.}         
  "We  went  on  holiday to Corfu for a
 couple of weeks,  we are very lucky in
 1985  because we can  get  to  foreign
 countries  quickly     by   aeroplane.
 Hotels  are nicely furnished many with
 their  own  bathroom  and   television
 sets.  Our  hotel had a balcony  which
 overlooked the sea. They had very nice
 sun beds,  so you could lie in the hot
 sun and get  a  brown tan. There was a
 very big swimming  pool  too.  You can
 also  climb up some big  rocks.  Corfu
 is a Greek Island."                   </content>
