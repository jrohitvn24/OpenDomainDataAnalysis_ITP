		<title>19SHEEP SHEARING</title>
		<content> On{Tuesday 18th June 1985,}we went to 
{Court Green Farm}to watch some        
{sheep shearing.}There were 2 shepherds
 shearing the sheep and 2 shepherds    
 tying up the{fleeces.}To become an    
{expert shearer}they have to shear over
{40,000 sheep.}They have to hold the   
 sheep in a specific way, so they dont 
 kick and struggle and make it         
 difficult for the shearer.On the      
 sheeps coat there is a{greasy         
 substance{lanolin.}This lanolin acts  
 as  a{waterproofing}to the coat of the
 sheep in{wet weather.}The{fleeces}are 
 sent to {wool farm}near{Selby}where it
 is cleaned and spun  into wool. The   
 wool is then made into{garments.}After
 the sheep are sheared they are{dipped 
 for{sheep scab,}before they are sent  
 out into the fields to graze.
