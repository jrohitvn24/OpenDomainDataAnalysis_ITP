		<content> Local people were asked what they     
 condidered to be important problems at
 the moment.                           
 Many were very worried about the      
 problem of{football violence,}saying  
 that something had to be done but     
 did not want the action to be too     
 severe.                               
 Many people were concerned with the   
 problem of large{housing estates}being
 built everywhere.  They do not mind   
 them being built but felt that their  
 progress ought to be controlled. One  
 lady remarked that having sailed on   
 many rivers, it was noticeable that   
 the housing estates had been built up 
 around the area surrounding the rivers
 and flood plains.                     
 It was considered that the major      
 attractions in the area were Repton   
 School, the archaeological 'dig' and  
 the church.                           </content>
