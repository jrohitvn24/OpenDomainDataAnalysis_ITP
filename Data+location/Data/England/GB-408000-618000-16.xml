		<title>16The Church of Saint Maurice.</title>
		<content>  There has been a church in Eglingham 
 since Saxon times. Recently someone   
 came and, by dousing,found the outline
 of the first Saxon church. We praise  
 God in our church. Sometimes my Daddy,
 the Vicar, does special services for  
 children when we have film-slides, or 
 act little plays from the Bible.      
  On Sundays there is a service at 8.00
 or 10.15 a.m. Sometimes people go to  
 church to pray during the week. Many  
 ladies clean the church and put       
 flowers in it.Some men have mended the
 wall because it was old and crumbling.
  We had a day called "Living in the   
 Light" recently when a lot of people  
 came from as far away as Edinburgh and
 Durham to dance sing and play guitars.
 The Bishop came to talk too. We had a 
 meal in the Hall afterwards. My sister
 plays guitar in church sometimes with 
 her friends. They played at a wedding.</content>
