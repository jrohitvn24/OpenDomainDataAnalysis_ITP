		<title>05Traffic Congestion in Sidcup</title>
		<content>  Recently opposite the Post Office in 
 Sidcup there was a crash involving a  
 motorcycle.The{man on the motorcycle  
{was killed.}It is thought that he     
 crashed into the side of a car that   
 was being{driven recklessly.          
  Many accidents are caused by{busy    
{traffic.}Made even more likely by the 
 number of{parked cars}at the side of  
 roads.                                
  Hollies Avenue, a turning off        
 Half-way Street was closed at the     
 begginning of the year because{too    
{much traffic}was using the road.But   
 since then there have been many       
 accidents in the roads around Hollies 
 Avenue which are much narrower.Many   
{locals have complained}so it is likely
 that something will be done about the 
 matter.                               
                                       
                                       </content>
