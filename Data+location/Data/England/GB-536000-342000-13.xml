		<title>13A TYPICAL DAY FOR AMY.</title>
		<content>   I wake up at 7a.m. and read until I 
 get up at 8a.m.. I make my breakfast  
 of cereals, sultanas and milk. I pack 
 my recorder, reading book and topic   
 and walk to school.                   
   When I get there I put my packed    
 lunch in the porch and meet my        
 friends. The bell rings at 9a.m. and  
 we go into class. In the morning we do
 Maths, English,writing stories or     
 handwriting. We have a break at 10.40 
 for 20 minutes when I play with my    
 friends Claire and Robyn.             
   Dinner time is 12.oo. Hot meals are 
 no longer provided so we have packed  
 lunch. School starts again at 1p.m.   
 when we do various things. There is a 
 break at 2.15 for 15 minutes and      
 school ends at 3.15.                  
   I go to recorders then Robyn comes  
 home with me. We go to ballet and     
 afterwards we have tea. Bed at 8.30.  </content>
