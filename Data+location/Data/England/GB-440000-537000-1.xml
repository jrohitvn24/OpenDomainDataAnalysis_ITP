		<title>01PETERLEE,CASTLE EDEN AREA</title>
		<content> This area which lies only 4 kms from  
 the North Sea,is predominately rural, 
 situated in the Easington Rural       
 District of the County of Durham.It is
 dominated by a local nature reserve   
 called Castle Eden Dene,and it,and the
 surrounding farmland are bounded by   
 the outskirts of Peterlee New Town,by 
 the village of Castle Eden,Old        
 Shotton,Hesleden and by the old       
 colliery village of Wingate.Once the  
 area's wealth came from mining and    
 heavy industry but their decline has  
 led to an unemployment situation which
 the new light industry of Peterlee and
 the established farming has not been  
 able to combat.Many of the population 
 therefore travel to the larger centres
 of Newcastle,Middlesbrough and        
 Sunderland using the fast,new         
 A19,which acts as an artery for the   
 district.                             </content>
