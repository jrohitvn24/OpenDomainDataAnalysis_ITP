		<title>17A SCHOOL FLOCK</title>
		<content>   Kingstone High School has kept a    
 flock of sheep since 1975 when land   
 adjacent to the school was purchased  
 for this purpose. Prior to this the   
 school had become involved in         
 organising breed trails for the       
 Ryeland Flock Book Society using the  
 home farms of pupils. The scheme      
 itself together with the many         
 resulting educational offshoots       
 attracted the attention of a large    
 number of other similar establishments
 in this country and abroad.           
   Supreme awards have been won at     
 major shows by both the school and    
 individual pupils in OPEN competition.
 The scheme has attracted the interest 
 and active participation of parents,  
 with the press both local and national
 always ready to report any new        
 developments involving the school     
 flock or its young shepherds.         </content>
