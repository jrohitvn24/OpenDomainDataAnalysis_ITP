		<content> CROSSING THE BAY                      
                                       
 Silverdale has become the starting    
 point for the cross-bay walks to      
 Grange-over-sands and Kents Bank.     
 These walks take place at fortnightly 
 intervals during the summer months    
 depending on tidal conditions. Walkers
 are not encouraged to undertake the   
 journey on their own as the Bay has   
 shifting areas of treacherous         
 quicksand. Organised parties are led  
 by the official Guide to the Sands.   
 Mr. Robinson, the Guide, always       
 attempts the walk the day before      
 leading a party.                      
 The crossing takes between two and    
 three hours and the party is often    
 several hundred strong and has an     
 almost Biblical appearance.
