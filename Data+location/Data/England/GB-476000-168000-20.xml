		<title>20  OUR SCHOOL HISTORY</title>
		<content> Charles Kingsley was the founder of   
 our school which is called St.Paul's. 
 He made it in 1886 because he wanted  
 the children off the streets. The     
 school was built on Reading Rd.but    
 was later moved to Oxford Rd.in 1967. 
 The school is still on Oxford Road.   
 This school is much more modern and is
 very warm,even in the middle of       
 winter.It's not dark because there are
 windows in lots of places.The         
 classrooms are big and spacious.We    
 have four terrapins and one big       
 Portakabin.The school has a mini      
 meadow round the school library and we
 also have a butterfly garden.Next to  
 the butterfly garden is the field with
 the pond and the swimming pool.There  
 are 16 adults not including dinner    
 ladies and controllers.There are 11   
 classes and 1 Portakabin,a hall and an
 entrance hall.                        </content>
