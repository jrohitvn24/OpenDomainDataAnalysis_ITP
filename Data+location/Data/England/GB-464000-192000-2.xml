		<title>02Houses in Upperton</title>
		<content> Upperton contains a variety of houses.
 There are bungalows, terraced houses, 
 detatched and semi-detatched houses,  
 of various ages and styles.  Most have
 good sized gardens. The houses follow 
 the line of the road and are surounded
 by farm land.  Most of the houses are 
 made out of brick but some are        
 thatched cottages with stone walls.   
 There is a row of terraced brick      
 houses, called windows Row.In the     
 centre of this row of houses there is 
 a plaque with the date of 1901 on it. 
 However, the houses were built earlier
 than this, as 1901 was the date when  
 the houses were repaired. Some of     
 these little houses only had an       
 indooor water supply installed about  
 five years ago.
