		<content> MR. JOHN SMITH of Manor House Farm    
 told us about his work. Wheat, barley 
 and oats are grown and sold for animal
 feed and pet foods. Some rape is sold 
 directly from the combine and two or  
 three cuttings of cultivated grass are
 taken each year to be made into silage
 for winter feed. About thirty cows are
 kept for fattening to be sold as store
 cattle. A flock of eighty ewes        
 provides lambs for sale as they are   
 weaned. Chickens are intensively      
 farmed with one unit being used to    
 bring on 17,000 day old chickens.     
 MR.McCABE is a veterinary surgeon. His
 most useful instrument is a syringe   
 and the medicines most often used are 
 antibiotics. Eczema is the most common
 illness affecting cats and dogs with  
 polio and distemper the worst he has  
 treated. He advises dogs and cats as  
 lovely house pets.                    </content>
