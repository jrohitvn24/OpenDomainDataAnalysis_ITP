storm water off Warstones Road.        
Opposite the library are the local     
shops. In the entrance area there is a 
showcase with books and photographs. As
you go into the library there is a     
large desk where you receive your      
tickets and get your books stamped. To 
your left is the childrens section     
where there are 6,596 younger peoples' 
books. The adults section has 17,656   
books. The library lends an average of 
4000 books a week and has 6,156        
borrowers. It has a Micro Fiche        
computer which will display book and   
authors on micro film. 7 people work at
the library, four full time and three  
part time. It opens every day except on
a Sunday.                              </content>
