		<content> The part of Lincolnshire that i live  
 in is mostly flat although you would  
 not think so if you have to cycle a   
 lot of the time.Even some of the small
 hills can be very tiring.My Dad does  
 not like driving on the country roads 
 because he says that there are far too
 many bends.The roads do have a lot of 
 right angled bends because there are  
 lots of drainage ditches and hedges   
 that stop them going in a straight    
 line.                                 
 In the winter time there are lots of  
 minor accidents on the small country  
 roads because the weather can get very
 bad at times.It gets so bad at times  
 that the school buses do not come out 
 to take us to school.I feel really    
 unhappy when this happens!Last year   
 our neighbour drove into a ditch      
 during heavy snow and he had to be    
 pulled out by a tractor the next day. </content>
