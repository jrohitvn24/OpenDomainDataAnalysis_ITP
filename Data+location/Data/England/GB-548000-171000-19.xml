		<content>   On 31st May pupils at our School    
 School received a newsletter          
 concerning the selling off of school  
 land that is in 'excess of school     
 requirments' due to falling rolls.    
 parents were bieng asked by the PTA to
 oppose this. Following up information 
 from the P.T.A. we found this         
 imformation had originated from the   
{Bexley and Crayford Observer}.        
   We then contacted local government  
 officals who after a long series of   
 phone calls told us that this was     
 merely a Feasability Study to find    
 possible money for the Education      
 Authority. The land would be sold to  
 the local council who would agree not 
 to develop it. The local paper might  
 be jumping the gun and the PTA        
 overreacting but that remains to be   
 seen.
