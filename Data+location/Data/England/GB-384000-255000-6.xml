		<title>06SUBURBAN WILDLIFE ONE</title>
		<content>  This part of Worcester is a mixture  
 of houses,factories and some open     
 spaces.Even though it is mainly built 
 up there is still a lot of wildlife to
 be seen if you look carefully.Factory 
 building is making wildlife decrease  
 by filling in{pools}and uprooting     
 trees and slowly polluting the        
{canal.                                
   But in factories house martins nest 
 and are doing well.Near Webb Fastners 
 factory there is a small newt{pond    
 which is being filled in and dead     
 newts float to the top of the         
 water.Near this{pond}is an old oak    
 tree which has been pulled up.Quite   
 close is the{canal.}Carp and other    
 fish are quite common in the{canal}   
 such as Bream,Gudgeon,Perch,Roach,    
 Dace,Bleak,Chub and Pike and sometimes
 the odd{hybrid}which is both a Bream  
 and Roach together.                   </content>
