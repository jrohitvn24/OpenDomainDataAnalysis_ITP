		<title>12FARMING: CHERRY WILLINGHAM</title>
		<content>   In Cherry Willingham and Reepham    
 there are two farms although we are in
 an area dominated by farm land. The   
 land is mostly arable with just three 
 or four fields containing cattle      
 (usually Lincoln Reds). We have over a
 period of time a large number of crops
 but rape seed, wheat, barley and      
 potatoes are the major crops. This    
 year there are a number of fields     
 which contain peas.                   
   Like many other farms in the county 
 the land is very intensively farmed   
 and it is not uncommon to see the     
 workers doing night shifts especially 
 during ploughing and harvesting       
 seasons.                              
   In our survey we noticed that about 
 10% of the field hedges no longer     
 exist and there is a large programme  
 of crop spraying.
