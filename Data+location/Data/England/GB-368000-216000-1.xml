  Our area consists of some of the most
 beautiful countryside found between   
 the River Severn and the Forest of    
 Dean.The rolling wooded hills rise    
 sharply from the Severn valley.They   
 are famous for sheep and for fruit    
 growing.The area includes several     
 small hamlets like{Little London}and  
{Flaxley}and two contrasting villages  
{Blaisdon and Longhope}which are the   
 focal points of our survey.The        
 villages are about 10 miles south west
 of the city of{Gloucester}and there is
 some commuting but there is also local
 employment.We have had a great deal of
 help in compiling this survey from{Mrs
{Pickering}of the Blaisdon Women's     
 Institute,from{Ian Cameron}Chairman of
 Longhope Parish Council and{Mrs       
{Harvey,Head Teacher}of Longhope Church
 of England primary school.            </content>
