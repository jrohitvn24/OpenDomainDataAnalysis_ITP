		<title>06BERKELEY VALE ARABLE FARMING</title>
		<content> The basic types of{arable farming}in  
 Berkeley Vale are{barley, wheat}and   
{oats.}The high yielding corn needs    
 careful tending with well broken up   
 soil and sprays for weeds, disease and
 pests which this type of corn is not  
 hardy enough to withstand. The weather
 plays a crucial role in{crop yields}as
 this summers poor harvest has shown.  
{Marketing outlets}are bakeries, animal
 feed producers and seed merchants. As 
 has happened with milk,{quotas}look   
 like coming in to control the over    
 production of cereals, despite this   
 years crop.                           
 Much of the work done on the local    
 arable farms is becoming more         
{mechanised,}which is resulting in{less
{farm work for local people.}One area  
 of expansion is in{computerised       
 maintenance and control of farms      
 requiring more specialised staff.     </content>
