		<title>13RECREATION IN TARRANT VALLEY</title>
		<content>  While I was exploring our block my   
 job was to ask people what they did in
 their spare time and I got lots of    
 different answers.The grown ups seemed
 to be the best off.If they didnt      
 want to watch the television they     
 could go out to the Langton Arms pub  
 and have a drink,play skittles or     
 darts.The pub has four skittles and   
 darts teams.Some of the older people  
 went for walks or did gardening as    
 most of the houses had large gardens  
 with lots of flowers and vegetables.  
 The chldren have not so much to do.   
 There is no playing feild or youth    
 club and the nearest youth club is in 
 Blandford.Some have ponies and ride   
 these in their spare time but they    
 must get bored a lot living in the    
 countryside.
