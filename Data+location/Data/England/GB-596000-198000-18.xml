		<content> A washing machine,fridge and colour   
 television are considered the most    
 essential modern appliances in our    
 homes with video recorders and        
 microwave ovens also becoming popular.
 About half primary age children have a
 home computer and enjoy playing       
 computerised games.They also like     
 electronic games but dolls including  
 action men are still the most popular 
 toys.Nearly every family has a pet    
 with cats top in popularity followed  
 by dogs and then fish.Children enjoy  
 wearing casual clothes like jeans and 
 track suits but girls like to dress up
 in skirts to go out.Most families take
 their main meal together in the       
 evenings.Convenience foods,especially,
 chips, are often eaten but on Sundays 
 the traditional roast dinner is       
 enjoyed at midday by nearly all       
 families.                             </content>
