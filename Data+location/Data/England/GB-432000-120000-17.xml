		<title>17THE PLAZA ROMSEY</title>
		<content> The Plaza was saved and renovated by  
 Romsey Amateur Dramatic Society and   
 re-opened as a theatre on 3rd January 
 1984 by Lord Romsey.  It had been a   
 cinema, then a bingo hall and very    
 nearly became a guest house!  Romsey  
 is very proud to have its own theatre,
 and helped raise the Â£140,000 needed. 
 It costs about Â£40 a day to run the   
 building so RAODS need lots of people 
 to visit the theatre instead of       
 watching television!  Come on tour to 
 see what it's like.  In the small     
 foyer is the box office and           
 refreshments stall.  On each side a   
 flight of stairs leading up to what   
 was once the old "circle".  Look up at
 the enormous light towering overhead  
 and the delicate glass emergency      
 lights.  They all date back to 1931   
 when the Plaza was built.
