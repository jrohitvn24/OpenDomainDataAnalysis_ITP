 The history of the area is dominated  
 by mining. Tin mining dates back to   
 Roman times and the Wheal Vor area    
 contained some of the most productive 
 tin and copper mines in Cornwall.     
 Production reached its peak at the    
 beginning of the 19th century but by  
 the beginning of the 20th century all 
 the mines were closed.  It is         
 difficult to imagine this peaceful    
 rural area was once an industrial     
 heartland but the Wheal Vor Valley was
 one of the most heavily industrialised
 parts of England in its heyday.  There
 is a mass of industrial archaeology to
 be studied in the area.  Individual   
 mines can still be identified and the 
 methods of their operation can be     
 understood from their ruins. The      
 landscape is dotted with shafts and   
 ruined engine houses.                 </content>
