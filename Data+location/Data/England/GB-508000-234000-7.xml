 Wrest Park Estate, and is worked      
 together with Fielden Farm,           
 Gravenhurst and Top Farm, Streatley.  
 Ion Farm and Fielden farm consist of  
 both old and new buildings. The old   
 buildings were erected in the l9th    
 century from local bricks which were  
 probably made from clay dug out of the
 pit in the village and fired in the   
 Kiln and Lower Gravenhurst. The modern
 buildings have been erected during the
 last 25 years and are purpose built   
 and made of steel, concrete and
