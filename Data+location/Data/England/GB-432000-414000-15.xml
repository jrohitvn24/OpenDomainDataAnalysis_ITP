		<title>15Chevet Hall in Wakefield</title>
		<content>   On our land use survey we visited   
 Chevet Park which was at one time part
 of the estate of Chevet Hall.  We     
 discovered that the Hall, which for   
 many years provided employment in the 
 area, had been demolished.  One of our
 class members has a grandmother who   
 remembers the sale of the contents of 
 the Hall so we enquired into it       
 because many of the older people      
 thought it was a pity that the Hall   
 was no longer there.                  
  Chevet Hall was the home of the local
 landed gentry, the Pilkington family, 
 for over 200 years. The family were   
 noted for the care and support that   
 they gave to the area and its people. 
 It was a sad day, therefore, when the 
 l4th Baronet decided to sell the Hall 
 and move to Hertfordshire.            
   The old Wakefield Corporation bought
 Chevet Hall in l949 for Â£8,000.       </content>
