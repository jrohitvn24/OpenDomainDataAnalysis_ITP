		<title>17FARMING CHANGES SINCE 1953</title>
		<content> Mr Richardson,the farmer at{Keybridge 
{Farm}has been there since 1953.When he
 bought the farm a lot of people{owned 
 their own farms but through the years 
 the Scottish Amicable Insurance Co.has
 bought most local farms. The{machinery
 has changed his life-style because it 
 has made life easier for him and his  
 wife. They used to milk cows by hand  
 before going to school and when they  
 came back. 32 years ago he went by    
 pony and trap to market but these days
 he goes by car. The{size}of the farm  
 used to be 45 acres but now they have 
 90 acres as they have bought more land
 from other farmers.When they came they
{grew}sugar beet, barley,grass and corn
 but this year they have only grass.   
 They had dairy cattle but since 1978  
 they've only had beef cattle as this  
 means less work and the E.E.C.pay a   
 subsidy.                              </content>
