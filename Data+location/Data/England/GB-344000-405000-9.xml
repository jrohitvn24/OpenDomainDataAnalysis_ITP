   TELL US A LITTLE ABOUT YOURSELF.    
 I was born on May 21st.1914,above my  
 father's tobacconist's shop in Sandy  
 Lane.As a child I went to Barnes Rd.  
 Primary School and then Upholland     
 Grammar School.I worked in my father's
 shop for 16 years and the family lived
 above it.I was in the army for 6 years
 from 1939-45.In 1945 I married Irene  
 and we moved to Witham Rd. where we   
 still live.I worked at Pilkington's   
 Laboratories at Lathom for 15 years   
 until I retired in 1979.

 place.It had a population of 4000
