		<title>03Langage Farm Plympton St.M.</title>
		<content>    The farm looks more like a building
 site because they are constructing a  
 farm shop.In it they are going to sell
 dairy products:- cream,ice-cream and  
 yogurt and cheeses.                   
    The farm itself was mentioned in   
 the original{Domesday Book,}and some  
 parts of it look as though they might 
 tumble down.It covers about{250 acres 
 and also includes Combe Farm which    
 is derelict.                          
    The present owner has owned the    
 farm for 30yrs.He keeps{Jersey}cows   
 (which is unusual for the area),and he
 enters cream in the{Devon County Show 
 each year and this year he won a first
 prize.                                
    The local authority bought 20 acres
 from the farm in order to build a new 
 road to serve a new{Industrial Estate.
