In the milking parlour there is room   
for twelve cows, six on each side. As  
the cows on one side are finished they 
are replaced by six more. The milk from
the cows goes into jars which have     
litres marked on. A good cow will give 
up to 30 litres each day. In the       
afternoon a cow will give less milk    
than in the morning. The cows are fed  
with a high protein food while they are
milked. This gives 15-20 litres of milk
each day, the rest comes from grass.   
The cows teats are sprayed with Iodine 
to reduce the risk of infection. The   
milk is pumped into a large cooled     
tank. Then the dairy lorry comes and   
empties the tank. Some of the milk is  
saved to suckle the calves so that they
get some protection from their mothers.
All the cows used for milking were pure
Freisian.                              </content>
