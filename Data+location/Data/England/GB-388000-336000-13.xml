		<title>13LOWER MODDERSHALL &amp; MILLS 1</title>
		<content> Lower Moddershall is composed of a    
 valley following the stream and ponds 
 once used for a series of working     
 mills, the top pond being at the Boars
 Head, from where the stream runs      
 downhill through the one remaining    
 mill pond, and on to the side of the  
 Longton Road to Stone.                
  The remaining pond is situated in the
 grounds of Splashy Mill, and the wheel
 remaining intact, is in working order,
 and a B listed building.  As far as   
 one knows it has never lapsed into    
 inactivity, and the wheel itself has  
 recently had new wooden slats and     
 works well.                           
  The whole area of Lower Moddershall  
 is a conservation area, and except for
 a cluster of 5 houses is mainly grass 
 and woodland. The trees are mostly    
 deciduous, the most attractive being a
 group of larches by Splashy Mill pond.</content>
