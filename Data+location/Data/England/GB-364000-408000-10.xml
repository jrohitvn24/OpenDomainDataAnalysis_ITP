		<title>10School Games in Lostock 2</title>
		<content> Sometimes when our class are not      
 playing cricket or rounders we get    
 together and play a game called{Rover.
 It's a really good game - here are the
 rules.                                
                                       
   First of all you get an even number 
 of people and choose two teams. After 
 that one of the teams link arms and   
 call over one person from the other   
 team saying{"Rover, Rover send 'named 
{person' over".}So the person who has  
 been called runs from one end of the  
 play-ground to the other team's linked
 arms and tries to break through.      
   If he or she does break through they
 take back one of the opposite team. If
 they don't get through they stay on   
 the linked arms team and the other    
 team then start again by saying       
{"Rover, Rover send 'named person'     
{over".                                </content>
