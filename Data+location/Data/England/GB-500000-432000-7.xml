		<content>  Mr Clapham's shop is an old building 
 and he has had it since 1959. The Post
 Office is also a shop which Mrs       
 Clapham looks after and they sell some
 medical goods, sweets and pet food. Mr
 Clapham is also the village milkman   
 and he delivers milk, lemonade,       
 butter, fruit juices and cordials. He 
 gets his milk from Northern Dairies.  
 The milk is delivered to his shop the 
 night before and kept in a big fridge 
 overnight. Mr. Clapham gets up at 5am 
 and sets of on his round at 6am. He   
 finishes his round at lunchtime.      
  Mr and Mrs Clapham have nine dogs;   
 one is a Red Setter and the rest are  
 Border Terriers which he breeds and   
 shows. They also have a pony which is 
 kept in a field near their house.
