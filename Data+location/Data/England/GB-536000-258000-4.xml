 The main road that runs through       
 Hardwick is called the A45 it runs    
 through the centre of the block.On St 
 Neots road there are two cafes,they're
 called the Little Chef and the        
 Enterprize.The bus service for the    
 area is Whippet Coaches.We have done a
 traffic survey looking at the traffic 
 going east and west along the A45.We  
 saw 852 vehicles altogether there were
 531 cars 208 lorries 4 motor bikes 8  
 coaches and 101 van's.The other roads 
 in the block are much smaller whith   
 less traffic flow and run mainly north
 to south.Most of the traffic throgh   
 Hardwick and Madingley is commuting to
 work in and out of Cambridge.Most of  
 the A45 is by-passing Cambridge is    
 tourist or buissness traffic.A45 links
 onto the M11 to London to Leeds and   
 North.                                </content>
