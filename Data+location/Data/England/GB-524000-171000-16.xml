		<content>For two weeks of the year the usually  
quiet suburb is crowded with tennis    
fanatics hoping to see some of the     
famous stars-John McEnroe,Jimmy Connrs,
Jo Durie,Martina Navratilova-all       
playing for the two million prize      
money.This year saw the fall of the    
graceful Viginia Wade who first played 
in 1973.The local church field is      
turned into a busy carpark which makes 
around 8500 pounds during the two weeks
for several charities.This year a      
teenager,Jacqueline Pushong,was the    
first ball girl ever allowed on the    
famous Centre Court.She was one of 22  
school girls picked for the job.Also   
this year Wimbledon faced the problem  
of forged tickets.Police found 120     
forgeries which were sold for 24,000   
pounds.They were of a very high quality
and people were easily deceived.
