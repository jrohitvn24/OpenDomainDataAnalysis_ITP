		<title>14A Housewife's Day</title>
		<content> My day begins at 6.30 when I am       
 awakened by the clock radio. I don't  
 rise at this unearthly hour but lie   
 dozing until 7.30. After a frantic    
 rush and last minute shouts of "Have  
 you cleaned your teeth and have you   
 got your spelling book, Elizabeth?"   
 the children arrive at school by 9.00.
 It's my day for school too. I help    
 with the infants which I enjoy        
 greatly. It's more interesting than   
 housework.                            
 When I get home at midday I have a cup
 of coffee and turn on the radio. Then 
 I tackle Sophie's bedroom. This takes 
 courage as she is very creative. The  
 children play after school until      
 suppertime. Once they have gone to    
 bed, I have time to watch the         
 television or read before having my   
 bath and falling into bed about 11p.m.
