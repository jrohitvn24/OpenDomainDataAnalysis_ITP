  Quite a few people grow their own    
 vegetables and food in {Chilsworthy.} 
 Some things need to be bought from    
 shops, but most  things can be grown. 
 Things like potatoes ,peas,carrots and
 cabbages are grown in home gardens.   
 These things can also be obtained from
 shops and grocers. When we did a      
 survey on people's favourite meals,   
 only seventeen people out of thirty   
 four mentioned a meal with vegetables 
 in it.Most people preferred meals     
 using meat,egg and toast. Some gardens
 are not suitable to grow vegetables   
 in because of too many stones or of a 
 disease in the earth.When this        
 happens,food has to be bought from    
 shops and supermarkets in Holsworthy.
