    NETBALL began in England as        
 basketball in America.In netball there
 are seven players and in basketball   
 only five.The object of the game is to
 get as many goals through a net on a  
 post by not fouling or cheating.The   
 main passes you use are a bounce      
 pass,chest pass and overarm pass.The  
 bounce pass is used when all your team
 players are marked so you do a small  
 bounce to carry on with the play.A    
 similar pass is the underpass,a throw 
 without bouncing.The chest pass is    
 when you throw to a player chest to   
 chest.The overarm pass is when you    
 throw over the opponents' heads to get
 to your own team player.To score you  
 shoot through a ring in a post without
 moving your feet.      (Miranda)
