 At 12.00 on Saturday all of our gym   
 team met at Webster's Way car park to 
 do a gym display at the{May Day Fair.}
 We got in free.We did vaulting and    
 then we did routines in pairs.Our     
 music was{Star Wars.}We did some      
 trampeting.We ran up fast and jumped  
 on the trampet and did forward        
{somersaults.                          
                                       
 I put on my{Wickford Youth Band       
 uniform and went in the van to the    
 fair.I play the {Bell Lyre.}We marched
 in to the arena playing {Eye Level.}We
 played 8 more tunes and finished with 
 our{Band Salute.}My dad gave me a Â£1  
 to spend at the Fair.I got in free but
 a Hot Dog and a packet of crisps cost 
 me 47p.I went round the back of the   
 Mill Hall to watch the{absailing.
