		<title>04NORTH DURHAM VILLAGE (CONT)</title>
		<content> The local Vicar leads a very busy life
 and the Church is used for Burials,   
 Marriages and Christenings. Young and 
 old alike attend the Church and the   
 normal congregation is 120. More      
 people have attended the Church in    
 1985 than in 1984. The Church is      
 interesting and the Vicar often shows 
 groups around. The Vicar often has to 
 help with the problems that people    
 face in their daily lives and he is   
 often asked for advice. The local     
 Church of West Pelton (C of E) is     
 interesting because there is a Stained
 Glass Window donated by the villagers 
 after they all escaped a Cholera      
 epidemic which affected the whole of  
 the rest of the area. There are also  
 plaques to the mine-owning Fenwick    
 family who gave the land for the      
 Church to be built. There is also a   
 large graveyard.                      </content>
