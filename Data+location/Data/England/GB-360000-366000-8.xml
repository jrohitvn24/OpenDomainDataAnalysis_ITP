{****************************          
 The farm,extending over approximately 
 150 hectares,is totally committed to  
 dairy farming. Mr and Mrs Robinson    
 assisted by their son Paul and two    
 local employees are raising a herd of 
 260 Friesian dairy cattle which       
 produce 2300 litres of milk per year. 
   The milk is sold to Heal's Dairy and
 transported to Manchester each day for
 retail sale or conversion into dairy  
 products. Mr.Robinson is conscious of 
 the need to make the farm efficient   
 and although dairy farmers in general 
 have been affected by the E.E.C. quota
 system, he has been able to adjust to 
 the changing circumstances            
 successfully.The farm uses modern     
 methods of feeding and milk production
 and is well equipped with up to date  
 machinery.                            </content>
