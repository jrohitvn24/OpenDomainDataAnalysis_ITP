		<title>19DOLPHIN CANDLES</title>
		<content> Upon the road to Membury there is a   
 house called {Myrtle}Cottage.The lady 
 who owns it makes candles.In her      
 show_room are many small animal       
 candles,which can sometimes be seen at
 the Honiton Show in August.The        
 show_room is open every day from      
 9.00a.m. to 6.00p.m.The lady who makes
 the candles buys the wax,which is     
 melted into a liquid and poured into  
 rubber moulds.Then she melts the paint
 before placing the hardened wax       
 figures into it.She counts to five and
 takes them out.The extras are painted 
 on by hand.                           
 Her husband is a miniaturist making   
 beautiful dolls'houses by hand.These  
 can also be seen in the show_room.
