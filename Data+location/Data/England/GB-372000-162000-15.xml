		<title>15BEAR FLAT SHOPPING AREA,BATH</title>
		<content>  In the {BEAR FLAT}Shopping Precinct  
 there is a fish and chip shop which is
 especially popular with the local     
 schoolchildren. The local pub is      
 called the {BEAR HOTEL}which has a    
 full-sized model of a polar bear above
 the entrance. A toy shop called {     
{BRIANS}sells  jokes and games. The    
 local garage sells and services B.M.W.
 cars and motorcycles. Other shops and 
 amenities include a pet shop, a post  
 office and a couple of small          
 supermarkets.                         
   The Bear Flat is a very busy area   
 which lies about one and a half miles 
 north of Bath city centre. Because of 
 the wide variety of shops it is hardly
 necessary to go into town.            
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
