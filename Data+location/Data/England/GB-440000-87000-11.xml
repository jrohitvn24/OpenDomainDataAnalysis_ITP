		<content>    The{traffic lights}are fairly new. 
 They had to have them because it was  
 very dangerous.People could not go    
 round the corner with a pram.They did 
 not have a pavement to walk on.There  
 were lots of lorries shooting round   
 the corner so they put traffic light  
 there.                                
    There is a{keep fit}club that meets
 in the church hall. The{Women's       
{Institute}- Ningwood and Shalfleet    
 meet outside our area. A Youth Club   
 was started but there wasn't enough   
 support.                              
    For  a special occasion, like the  
 Queen's Jubilee or the wedding of     
 Carles and Diana the village          
 celebrates in the field down the lane.
 They put flags round and hold parties.
 The{Morris dancers}perform outside the
 New Inn. The church organises various 
 social events.                        </content>
