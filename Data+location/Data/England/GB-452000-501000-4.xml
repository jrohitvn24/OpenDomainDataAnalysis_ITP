		<title>04MOTOR BIKE SCRAMBLING</title>
		<content> On Carlton Bank there is a scrambling 
 course which is used by a tremendous  
 number of enthusiasts. The course is  
 easy to spot from afar: a large red   
 scar on the hillside.  During the     
 summer the course is in use all       
 daylight hours, much to the annoyance 
 of local residents who, along with    
 Parish Councils have pressed the      
 National Parks Committee to stop the  
 activities. The properly organised    
 club say they use private ground in a 
 responsible way, but other cyclists   
 are not so careful. As well as noise  
 being a nuisance there is concern at  
 the misuse of woodland tracks, riding 
 on heather and on footpaths. Problems 
 with parking and disturbance to       
 picnickers have also been reported. As
 there is concern, an alternative site 
 is sought, leaving a restricted,      
 managed area at the foot of the bank. </content>
