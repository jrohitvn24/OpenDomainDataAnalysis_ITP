		<title>07A MECHANIC'S WORKING DAY</title>
		<content> The mechanic we visited worked at     
 Wyton Garage. He starts work at the   
 garage at 8.30a.m. His favourite job  
 is mending cars that have been in     
 an accident and re-spraying them with 
 paint.                                
 The mechanic travels to work in his   
 own car and sometimes while he is at  
 work he drives the garage's big pick  
 up truck. He wears a pair of overalls 
 whenever he works in the garage.      
 He has been working at Wyton Garage   
 for 20 years and he has all the tools 
 and equipment he needs to enjoy his   
 job.                                  
 At Wyton Garage they only work on cars
 but he remembers repairing some very  
 expensive ones, like Mercedes and     
 Jaguar.                               
 The mechanic finishes work at 5.15p.m.
 and that is the end of his working    
 day.                                  </content>
