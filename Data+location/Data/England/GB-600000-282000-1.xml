		<title>01N. Lopham Area, Introduction</title>
		<content>     The rectangle surrounding         
 N. Lopham is almost all agricultural  
 land.  Our landscape is flat with lots
 of open sky.  We can see many trees,  
 but they are getting fewer.  Many     
 hedgerows have been taken out by      
 farmers.  Most of the land is arable. 
 The crops mostly grown are: sugar     
 beet, rape, wheat, potatoes, barley.  
 There are also several small 'battery'
 egg producing factories and pig units.
                                       
      The village was once famous for  
 growing and working flax and hemp.    
 Today nothing is left except a few    
 weavers' cottages and the village pond
 (Letchmere), where flax and hemp were 
 once soaked to loosen the fibres.  N. 
 Lopham also has a war memorial, a     
 church and a Methodist chapel.  The   
 school is a Voluntary Aided Church of 
 England Primary.                      </content>
