		<title>04The Rose and Crown.</title>
		<content> As far back as 1577 William Chatner   
 kept a public house in Brailsford.By  
 the beginning of the 19th Century     
 there were three public houses in the 
 village.In 1911 only the Rose and     
 Crown remained.It was bought from the 
 Dalton family by Offilers Brewery,now 
 Bass Worthington.The Rose and Crown is
 now occupied by Ian and Shirley       
 Gray,who have been there for eighteen 
 months.They sell about 200 gallons of 
 beer each week,as well as spirits,soft
 drinks and food,which is served as bar
 snacks or in the restaurant.The       
 property has 3.5 acres of land which  
 will be developed to increase the     
 facilities that can be offered.The car
 park,at present,has spaces for 70 cars
 but this is not enough because there  
 are residential facilities which have 
 never been fully developed.
