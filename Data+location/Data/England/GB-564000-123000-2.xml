		<content>    The High Street today has houses   
 dating from the 16th century to modern
 times - and from large houses of      
 wealthy Landowners, to traditional    
 workman's cottages. It is interesting 
 to note however, that the latter are  
 now sold at an enormously high price -
 generally to retired people seeking   
 the peace and tranquility of village  
 life. An Old People's home, built in ,
 on the site of the old rectory has    
 been constructed architecturally in   
 keeping with the other buildings on   
 the High Street. There are three small
 council estates in the village, and a 
 small development of bungalows at the 
 East end.
