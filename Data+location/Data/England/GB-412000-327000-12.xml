		<content> In 1944 the countryside for miles     
 around was rocked by a terrible       
 explosion; an ammunition dump stored  
 in an old mine at Fauld was detonated.
 62 people were killed altogether.     
 Although the explosion was 3 Km. from 
 Draycott in the Clay very many        
 families were affected as they had    
 relatives working near the mine.      
                                       
 The Royal forest has meant an         
 association with Royalty for many     
 years. There is a tradition that to   
 celebrate jubilees and coronations the
 villagers build an enormous bonfire   
 on top of a local hill. The bonfire is
 built in a special way and on the last
 occassion in 1977 was over 10 m. high.
 A photograph is usually taken before  
 it is fired of all those who helped to
 build it, with those who worked       
 hardest sitting nearest the top.      </content>
