		<content>  {All Saints' Church}still has a 13th 
 century tower and a 16th century spire
 but the rest of the church was rebuilt
 in the 1870s in the Early English     
 style. Stone from an old chapel at{   
{Ewen}was used to rebuild the South    
 Transept, now known as the{Ewen}aisle.
 Next to the church is{Kemble House,}a 
 fine{Cotswold}stone manor house and   
 the hub of the{Kemble}estate for many 
 generations. It was built in the 17th 
 century but altered in the 19th       
 century.                              
 There are many attractive cottages in 
 Kemble and in{Kemble Wick}and there   
 are also some larger houses dating    
 from Victorian times. The school was  
 built in 1873 and the village hall    
 opposite in 1899.
