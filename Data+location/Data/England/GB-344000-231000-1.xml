		<content> Didley is a small scattered hamlet    
 situated along the A465 trunk road    
 just west of centre in the block.  To 
 the north west are wooded slopes and  
 the remainder of the area is mostly a 
 flattish valley of good, deep         
 agricultural land supporting about a  
 dozen farmsteads a wide variety of    
 livestock and crops.  In addition to  
 the A465 the area is travessed by a   
 number of lesser roads, a main line   
 railway and a brook (worm Brook) with 
 a number of tributarys. The whole is  
 an area of much natural beauty with   
 hedgrows, trees streams and pleasant  
 views.  although the area is          
 predominantly agricultural more then  
 half the inhabitants are engaged in   
 other employments, many in nearby     
 Hereford.
