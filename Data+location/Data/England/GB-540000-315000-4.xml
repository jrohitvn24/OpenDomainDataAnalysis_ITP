		<content>    The Shire Drain was always the most
 important waterway in the parish.It   
 forms a county boundary,a parish      
 boundary,and long ago was a boundary  
 between two Saxon kingdoms,called     
 Mercia and East Anglia.The Shire Drain
 runs from near Peterborough to Tydd   
 and so on to the sea.It was at        
 sometime the old course of the River  
 Nene,but that river now runs through  
 Wisbech.Parts of the Shire Drain have 
 different names,like Cat Water,The    
 Elloe River and The Shoffendike.      
    Cats Lane is a lane in the village,
 and is so named because it leads to   
 Cat Water.                            
    Mr.Pentelow once found a Roman     
 brooch near the Shire Drain.In a field
 near the Shire Drain there are some   
 Romano- British kiln bars and some    
 medieval pottery.
