		<content>                                       
    THE MAIN INDUSTRY IN WEST ROW IS   
FARMING. SITUATED ON THE EDGE OF THE   
FEN MUCH OF THE LAND IS FREE DRAINING  
WHILST THE REST IS PROTECTED BY A GOOD 
DRAINAGE SYSTEM.                       
    THE MAJORITY OF FARMS ARE ARABLE   
THOUGH THERE ARE SOME MIXED FARMS WITH 
CATTLE, PIGS AND SHEEP.                
    AGRICULTURE IN THIS AREA IS BASED  
ON SUGAR-BEET,POTATOES AND WHEAT.OTHER 
CROPS INCLUDE BARLEY,RYE,CARROTS,ONIONS
AND GRASS.THERE IS A STRICT ROTATION OF
CROPS IN ORDER TO LESSEN THE SPREAD OF 
PESTS AND DISEASE.                     
    MARKET GARDENING IS A FEATURE OF   
THE DISTRICT WITH THE PRODUCE - FLOWERS
AND VEGETABLES - BEING SOLD EITHER     
LOCALLY OR IN LONDON.                  
    HIGH WINDS-FEN BLOWS-CAN BE A      
PROBLEM FOR THE FEN FARMER ESPECIALLY  
WITH THE NEWLY-SOWN SEED IN SPRING.    </content>
