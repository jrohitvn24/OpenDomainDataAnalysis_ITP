		<content>{Failsworth Pole}is the spiritual if   
 not geographical centre of the        
 district and nearly opposite stands   
 the {Pack Horse Inn.}Both are         
 important in Failsworth past and      
 present.  A short distance from the   
 Pole is the factory of {Failsworth    
{Hats }famous the world over and a     
 reminder that the textile industry    
 thrives in part.  {Marlborough Mill}, 
 adjacent to the {Rochdale Canal} was  
 not demolished when its part was      
 played.  It was converted to house    
 modern retail stores.  {Moston Brook} 
 is one of several land reclamation    
 schemes designed to improve the inner 
 city environment.  Wild orchids have  
 been seen growing here.  {Newton Heath
{Market} is a very popular attraction  
 on Monday, Wednesday and Saturday.    
 The river {Medlock }and {Daisynook}   
 are major recreation areas.           </content>
