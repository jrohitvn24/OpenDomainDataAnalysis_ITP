		<content>This is a story of decline and change. 
The staple employment of the area was  
and is farming, but the number of men, 
women and children employed now is     
no-where what it used to be.  The      
number of farms have declined as farms 
have been bought up.  The original farm
houses and many farm cottages are empty
or have been sold to commuters or the  
retired.                               
The Church is in decline.  The Vicar of
the Church disappeared a long time ago 
and a succession of Priests in Charge  
have cared for it.  It has been linked,
and unlinked, with a series of three   
other Churches.  It is expected to     
close because no-one goes to it.       
The bird and insect population has     
declined with the disappearance of     
hedges. The wild flowers have declined 
with verge and field spraying.
