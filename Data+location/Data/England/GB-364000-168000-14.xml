		<title>14Keynsham Leisure Centre.</title>
		<content>   The Leisure Centre is a huge        
 building. It was built in 1976. It is 
 behind the shops on Temple Street. To 
 get in you have to go down a flight of
 stairs. The swimming pool is down     
 another flight of stairs almost by the
 river. The sports hall is used for    
 table tennis, trampolening, badminton 
 and gymnastics. There are courses for 
 everyone and special courses for the  
 Over-50's to keep them fit and        
 healthy. There are also squash courts 
 and dancing classes. The Leisure      
 Centre is open every day (the swimming
 pool is also open for early morning   
 swimming). Sometimes clubs use the    
 swimming pool and you have to wait    
 until they have finished. There is a  
 bar in the Leisure Centre which       
 overlooks the swimming pool. The snack
 bar also overlooks the swimming pool  
 but sells mostly fried food!          </content>
