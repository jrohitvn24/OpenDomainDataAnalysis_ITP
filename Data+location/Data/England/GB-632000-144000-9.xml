		<title>09GUSTON VILLAGE LIFE</title>
		<content> Most of the villagers work in Dover   
 but some farther afield ,one commuting
 to London. 90% go to work by car. The 
 460 acre Guston Court Farm lies in the
 oldest part of the village. A family  
 farm changed little since Britain     
 joined the E.E.C. 200 acres produce   
 cereals,130 acres produce hay and the 
 rest is used for 125 dairy cows. A    
 fire in October destroyed the 6 bay   
 Dutch Barn causing damage estimated at
 Â£30,000. The whole farm is run by 3   
 people with 110hp tractor and a       
 combined harvester. The village still 
 has its pub "The Chance" with its     
 skittle alley. Little else brings the 
 community together. Residents are     
 fond of their quiet village but they  
 are concerned about the community's   
 decline. Particular worries at this   
 time are vandalism, littering and the 
 infrequent bus service.               </content>
