		<content>  **{Mr Scales the church warden}**    
                                       
 If you are a{church warden,}you are in
 charge of the church and everything in
 the church. So that if the church     
 warden wanted to take the seats out he
 could do it if two wardens agreed.    
                                       
 He was in the{choir}for 4 years from  
 the age of 7 - you had a choice of    
 being in the choir but in those days  
 the choir was very full.              
                                       
 He got no pocket money and started    
 working when he was 14, earning 4     
 shillings (20 pence) a week.          
                                       
 His father was a stone mason in{Egton 
{Estate.}He has worked for the church  
 for 60 years. He didn't have a best   
 pal at school because you were        
 friendly with everyone. By M.Templeton</content>
