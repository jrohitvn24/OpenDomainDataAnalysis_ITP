		<title>11DERBY SCANNER APPEAL</title>
		<content>   The{body scanner}was delivered to   
 Derbyshire Royal Infirmary in March   
 1985 and the first person was scanned 
 the following month. A target of      
 600 000 pounds was launched in March  
 of the previous year by the Duke of   
 Devonshire who is president of the    
 Derby Scanner Appeal Committee.  Derby
 High School contributed 1000 pounds   
 through a project during Lent which   
 included raffles, games, sponsorships 
 and competitions. Money was raised by 
 many other groups in a variety of ways
 e.g. dances, concerts, coffee mornings
 and jumble sales.  The body scanner is
 used for patients who are seriously   
 ill or after accidents. It is a quick 
 and painless way of examining the body
 in thirty minutes, replacing surgery  
 and other painful techniques. Many    
 people in our community will benefit  
 as it speeds up medical treatment.    </content>
