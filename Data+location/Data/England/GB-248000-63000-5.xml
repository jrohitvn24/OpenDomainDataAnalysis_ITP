		<content>   Until 1975 the South Devon and      
 Jersey breeds were seen on the        
 Maristow Estate. Now dairying is the  
 main source of income the Fresian     
 plays an important part with a total  
 herd of 400 cows. These produce some  
 6500 litres of milk per cow per year, 
 and have been chosen for their milk   
 yield,quality and bull calf selling   
 price at market.120 heffer calves are 
 kept as replacements, 240 cows are put
 to Fresian or Holstein bulls, the rest
 to cross bred bulls.Heffers for their 
 first calving are put to beef type    
 bulls, either Hereford or Aberdeen    
 Angus.                                
  Milk is collected daily by tanker    
 lorry and taken to the Co-op dairy for
 retail. Farmers are now paid for the  
 high protein content rather than the  
 high fat content as the diet          
 conscious public demand low fat food. </content>
