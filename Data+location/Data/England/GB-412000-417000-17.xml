		<title>17A DAY IN LIFE OF     1985</title>
		<content> I get up about 8.OOa.m. and put on my 
 school uniform.  I go downstairs and  
 have my breakfast.  Some days I have  
 toast, others it is cereal foods.     
 After breakfast I get my bag ready for
 school.  My parents take me to school 
 in our car which is a champagne       
 coloured Escort Ghia, arriving there  
 at about 8.55a.m.  During the school  
 day I do lessons such as English,     
 Maths., Topics, reading and games.  We
 have three playtimes a day including  
 the lunch break.  At 3.35p.m. the bell
 rings for home time.  I usually get   
 home around 4.OOp.m. and switch the   
 television on to watch childrens'     
 programmes until about 5.3Op.m.  Then 
 I have my tea after which I go to play
 out with my friends.  I come back in  
 at about 9.OOp.m. and go to bed at    
 1O.3Op.m.
