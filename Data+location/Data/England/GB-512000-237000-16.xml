		<content> The Chicksands Priory was once        
 beautiful parkland but now is a       
 defence area and the public bridleway 
 is closed.                            
     The rabbit population is          
 recovering after being seriously      
 affected by Myxomatosis.The fox is now
 only to be found in the wooded areas  
 of Chicksands and Rowney Warren.The   
 grey squirrel is very common in the   
 wooded areas.Fallow Deer and Muntjak  
 are fairly common, the Muntjak being  
 decended from a small number which    
 escaped from Woburn Park in the       
 1950's.                               
    Of the water birds, the Mallard is 
 very common and Canada Geese have been
 nesting in the area since 1981.Swans, 
 once common, are now rarely to be     
 seen.                                 
    There is little local land which   
 is not either built on or farmed.     </content>
