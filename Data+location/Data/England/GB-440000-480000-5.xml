		<title>05The Shopping Centre, Thirsk</title>
		<content> This area of trade includes the market
 place and some roads leading from it. 
 We did several surveys to find out    
 about this part of Thirsk.            
{Traffic Count:}Numbers and types of   
 vehicles passing through the town in  
 2O minutes.                           
{Northwards:}8O cars, 2l vans and      
 lorries, 3 buses, 4 bicycles.         
{Southwards:}74 cars, l5 vans and      
 lorries, l bicycle                    
 Most of the traffic was made up of    
 cars and small vans Large lorries are 
 able to avoid the town by using the   
 By-Pass. However, it still seemed very
 busy.                                 
{Pedestrian Count:}People needing to   
 cross the road, can use a Pedestrian  
 Crossing. We found it was used very   
 frequently. In just 20 minutes the    
 lights changed 29 times, and l62      
 people crossed.                       </content>
