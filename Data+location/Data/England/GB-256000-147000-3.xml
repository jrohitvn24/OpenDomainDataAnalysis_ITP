		<content> The South West Peninsula Coast Path   
 runs into Combe Martin from the west  
 above steep shaley cliffs.  Notable   
 beaches are Broadsands and Golden     
 Cove, the latter reached by a descent 
 of 208 steps.  Beaches are rocky and  
 pebbly with greyish sand exposed at   
 low tide.  They are ideal for swimming
 as there are no dangerous currents.   
      In 1919 a landslide above Golden 
 Cove removed a large slice of the old 
 Ilfracombe road and a new road was cut
 further inland.  The old road is now a
 gravel path.                          
      The partly wooded hillside       
 between the main road and the cliff   
 path, formerly a quarrying area, is   
 called Napps.                         
      A further section of the old road
 still runs from Newberry beach to join
 the main road at Sandaway Caravan     
  Park.                                </content>
