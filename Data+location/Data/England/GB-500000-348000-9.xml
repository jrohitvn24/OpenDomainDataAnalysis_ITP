		<content> The village has no surgery and        
 patients must travel to Sleaford or   
 Ruskington to visit a doctor.         
 The village hall can accommodate 200  
 people and is used regularly for      
 social functions, however it is not   
 suitable for indoor sports. There is  
 no public house, but there are        
 licensed social clubs in the village. 
 A mobile library visits the village   
 for one hour every fortnight.         
 The village has only two shops; a     
 general-store/post office and a       
 general-store/newsagent. The post     
 office is conveniently located in the 
 centre of the village. The other      
 general-store is at the western end of
 the village on College Road.
