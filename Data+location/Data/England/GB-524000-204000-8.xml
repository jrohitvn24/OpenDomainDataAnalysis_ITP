		<title>08Traffic around Brookmans Pk</title>
		<content>    No main roads go through Brookmans 
 Park and many of the roads in the     
 village are private and are repaired  
 by the people who live there. The main
 road which goes by the village is the 
 A1000 which is called the Great North 
 Road. Up to about 20 years ago this   
 was the main road to the north of     
 England and we have found mention of  
 it several hundred years ago when it  
 was a turnpike or toll road.          
    The A1000 is used to reach the new 
 M25 and the A1(M) so it is quite busy.
 There are often accidents on it near  
 the village and only two weeks ago    
 (beginning of July 1985) there was a  
 serious accident when a car was       
 speeding along the A1000 and hit a car
 coming out from a side road. Local    
 people have been asking for a speed   
 limit but so far this has been        
 refused.                              </content>
