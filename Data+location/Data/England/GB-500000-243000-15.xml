		<title>15Nuclear waste at Elstow ?</title>
		<content> The announcement by the Government    
 agency{NIREX}that the Elstow Storage  
 Depot in the east of our area is a    
 site chosen for the burial of{low     
{level nuclear waste}has caused much   
 local controversy. In defence of the  
 plan NIREX say that the disposal would
 be perfectly safe, the site having    
 been chosen ongeological grounds.     
 Opponents of the plan  known as{BAND -
{Bedfordshire}Against Nuclear Dumping, 
 believe that the site is unsuitable as
 it is so close to residential areas.  
 They point out that the transportation
 of the waste to the site would        
 constitute a further hazard, and that 
 not enough is known about the         
 long-term implications of burying     
 radioactive material. Despite a fierce
 publicity campaign there is generally 
 a feeling that central government     
 decisions will ultimately prevail.    </content>
