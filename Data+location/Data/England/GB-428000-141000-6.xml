		<title>06PROSPECT FARM (Cont.)</title>
		<content> He used to keep livestock but they    
 were too exspensive to feed.          
 The farm is 485 years old and was far 
 bigger when it was first founded. Mr  
 Machin has gradually bought in some of
 the original land but feels that the  
 farm is now big enough for him.He owns
 530 acres of working land and 6 acres 
 of woodland.                          
 Mr Machin has two dogs and three cats 
 he also owns a tennis court.          
 In addition to allowing storage for   
 farm machinery on his premises, he    
 allows a firm called Agrochemicals to 
 trade in one of his buildings. The    
 firm supplies farming chemicals to    
 local farmers.
