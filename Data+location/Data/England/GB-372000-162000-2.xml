		<title>02BATH HEADLINES 16/5/1985</title>
		<content> Today the headlines in the "Evening   
 Chronicle" were "BATH WELCOME, Â£15,000
 ROBBERY." A newly arrived Bath couple 
 got the worst kind of house warming   
 present when thieves stole Â£15,000    
 worth of jewelry from their house in  
  Grey Hill. Another headline was      
 "JOBLESS RULE OF FEAR". Britain's high
 level of unemployment was not,it said,
 the result of international economic  
 recession, but part of the Thatcher   
 Government's "rule of fear". Another  
 headline was:-                        
 "MOTHER IN BIZARRE DEATH RIDDLE".An   
 inquest is due to open tomorrow into  
 the bizarre death of a Bath mother    
 following a fire. The last headline:  
 "AVON ESCAPES SCHOOL BLOW."Avon has   
 escaped the latest hit-list issued by 
 Britain's second largest teachers'    
 union,but children in both Wiltshire  
 and Somerset face major disruptions.  </content>
