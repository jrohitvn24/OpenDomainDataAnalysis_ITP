		<title>05GRAFFHAM HALF-MARATHON</title>
		<content>   A half-marathon is over 13 miles.   
 The route is between Seaford College, 
 Graffham, Selham, and Heyshott        
 finishing at the college.  It was run 
 to raise money for Duncton recreation 
 ground.  1200 competitors entered this
 year, but not all of them finished.   
 Those who did got a medal.  You need  
 T-shirts and shorts.  You may need to 
 run with someone else for             
 encouragement.  You run for fun and   
 fitness.  The best weather to run in  
 is cloudy.  A drink is important      
 because it prevents dehydration. You  
 have to be careful not to do too much 
 too soon.  The heat can be another    
 problem on the day.  My dad ran and   
 goes out training at 5 p.m. daily,    
 after work.                           
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
