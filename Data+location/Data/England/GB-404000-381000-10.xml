		<title>10Chinley Station</title>
		<content> Chinley Railway station was once one  
 of the main stations along the        
 Manchester to Sheffield line. It used 
 to have six platforms in those days,  
 but now it has only two.              
 Not so many people use the station now
 and hardly anyone stays at the        
 Prince's Hotel, built during the boom 
 years of the railway. Passenger trains
 are now few and far between, though   
 there are ICI wagons which use the    
 track quite often, carrying limestone 
 from the quarries.                    
 Not so long ago the Flying Scotsman   
 came along the line with some other   
 old steam trains. When this happens,  
 people line the route just to catch a 
 glimpse of these engines and many     
 bring cameras and tape recorders, to  
 record the sights and sounds.
