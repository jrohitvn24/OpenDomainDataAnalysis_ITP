		<title>20Hopes for Southam's Future</title>
		<content> Until the end of the Second World War 
 there had been little change in       
 Southam. The popularity of the car    
 changed that and is the cause of many 
 problems today. Large lorries thunder 
 through Southam making the road very  
 dangerous. There has long been talk of
 a by-pass but so far nothing has      
 happened. After years of campaigning a
 pelican crossing was installed        
 recently.                             
  In 1974, Southam became part of      
 Stratford-on-Avon District Council.   
 Amenities in Stratford, provided for  
 by the rates of Southam are rather far
 away to enjoy.It is because of this   
 that S.A.S.P.A.(Southam Area Swimming 
 Pool Association) was formed, to raise
 money towards the cost of building a  
 pool. A Fun Run was held on July 7th  
 to raise money for this long-awaited  
 swimming pool.                        </content>
