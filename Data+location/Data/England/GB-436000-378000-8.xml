		<title>08FARMING IN THE DRONE VALLEY</title>
		<content>      The soil in this area varies from
 heavy clay to light loam. Some fields 
 are considerably wet because of       
 subsidence from old coal mines. Most  
 of these wet fields are used for      
 grassland. Other fields are used for  
 growing crops that include cereals,   
 oil seed rape, potatoes and swede. The
 grasslands support dairy cows, beef   
 cattle, sheep and pigs.               
      Poultry and pigs are often kept  
 in sheds for intensive farming. Many  
 of the fields retain their old hedge  
 boundaries but some enlarging for     
 crops has occurred.
