		<title>18DRUGS IN SOUTHPORT</title>
		<content>                                       
 In Southport today many people of all 
 cultures and ages are taking drugs.   
 Usually they start by taking soft     
 drugs,joints or spliffs and they like 
 it.However they soon get tempted into 
 cocaine or heroin.Heroin is the       
 killer,there are few survivors and    
 everyone connected gets hurt.Most     
 experimentors get trapped in the drug 
 cycle.They need more drugs and so more
 money.Burglary and petty theft are    
 ways of providing the money.Youngsters
 involved may peddle for their dealers 
 in return for free drugs.People begin 
 by smoking heroin but they all end up 
 injecting it full time.It is          
 frightening to see the people around  
 you killing themselves hour by hour,  
 from twelve year olds sniffing glue on
 Southport Promenade to nineteen year  
 olds injecting heroin in their homes. </content>
