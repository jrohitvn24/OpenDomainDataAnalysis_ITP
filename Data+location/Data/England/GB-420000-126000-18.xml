 Wessex Water Authority was formed     
 in 1974.Before water was supplied by  
 South Wilts Water Board.The water     
 comes from West Hampshire water       
 company's source at Hale and is       
 supplied by their reservoir           
 at Standlynch near Pepperbox.A few    
 farms in the area have their own      
 private source of supply.Wessex covers
 4,000 square miles and includes the
