		<title>14SCHOOL BUSES</title>
		<content> At 7.45 I have to walk down the road  
 for my daily trip to school in        
 Okehampton. It is a 20 mile round     
 trip. We get on as soon as our bus    
 comes to the bridge where we wait. We 
 travel to Monkokehampton to pick up   
 some people. Then we go on to         
 Exbourne, Dornaford and Okehampton.   
 When the bus arrives at school, the   
 1st and 2nd year students get off at  
 the lower school. The rest go on to   
 the upper school. At 4.00 the bell    
 goes for the end of school and we rush
 to our waiting bus. At 4.05 the bus   
 departs from lower school and goes on 
 to the upper school. At 4.10 the bus  
 departs for home. All together there  
 are 19 buses. People come from as far 
 as 20 miles away. In the winter snow  
 often stops the buses running and it  
 is impossible to get to school.
