		<content>   All children can use the large      
 library which was built by money      
 raised by the parents and Teachers    
 Association.It is a large room built  
 onto one of the outside walls.It is   
 lined with shelves full of books for  
 the youngest children and for the     
 children with reading ages of 14+.    
 There are comfortable arm chairs and  
 a well stocked non-fiction section    
 with many reference books.            
   The infants spend the afternoon with
 environmental study work. They are    
 taken on school visits to             
 firestations,bakeries,police stations 
 and other places of interest.Upon     
 return they write about their         
 experiences,paint pictures,make card  
 board models,and explore the visit    
 through movement,music,drama,and      
 science.
