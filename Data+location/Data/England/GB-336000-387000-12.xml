 The area around  Dovedale School  for 
 approximately  1 square  kilometre is 
 mainly residential housing.           
                                       
 There  are  areas  which  are terraced
 houses, but  most  of  the  houses are
 semi- detached.                       
                                       
 In our area is part of Sefton Park. It
 is noticeable that the older houses by
 the  park are much larger  than  newer
 modern houses.These houses are sub-let
 as flats, and a lot  of  them  are  in
 need of repair.                       
                                       
 By the railway  are the  old workmen's
 houses,these are terraced and are made
 of  sandstone, there  is  also the old
 village school.
