		<title>01    Town meets Country</title>
		<content> Fifty years ago the town was just     
 beginning its spread into the green   
 fields. Cottingham village alone is   
 the built up zone in the survey       
 block with any history older than     
 that. Even today there is a tenuous   
{green belt}around the village broken  
 only by the thin ribbons of high      
 class housing which stretch along the 
 main road links to Hull.              
 In the 1930s and again in the 1960s   
 and 1970s planned council estates     
 sprawled over the rich pastures of the
 river Hull floodplain. Only four years
 ago the earthmovers were back eating  
 up hundreds more acres to lay down a  
 by-pass road, easing the traffic      
 problems of Beverley, a small market  
 town 5 miles to the north. Old and new
 suburban Hull meets the green of the  
 hay fields, and the brown and gold of 
 the corn fields struggling to survive.</content>
