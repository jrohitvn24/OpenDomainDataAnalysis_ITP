		<title>10Life in Yarde</title>
		<content>     I{live in Yarde}with my           
 mother,father and brother. Our house  
 is called Yarde Farm because it was   
{once a working farm.}                 
     There are eleven other homes,but  
 soon an{old barn}that is being        
 converted will be{another house.}Most 
 of the people are retired. There is   
 only one other child apart from us.   
     There is no longer a working farm 
 in Yarde so the{fields around are    }
 owned by farmers in{other villages.   
{Our}house was also once an inn but now
 there is no inn, no shop and no       
 school.                               
     We{travel to school by car.}My    
 brother and I like to ride our        
 bicycles; sometimes Dad takes us out  
 on the roads. We also play in the     
 fields and like to dam up the stream. 
{Yarde is a nice place to live.  }
