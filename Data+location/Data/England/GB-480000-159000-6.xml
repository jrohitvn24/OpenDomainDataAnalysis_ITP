		<content> Five thousand years ago the           
 inhabitants of Yateley erected a      
 sacred stone and in the seventh       
 century the Saxons built a stone      
 church on this spot on the directions 
 of Pope Gregory. The stone was left in
 place to become the corner stone of   
 the Christian Church. Then in the     
 eighth century the Saxon church was   
 sacked by the Danes only the lower    
 three feet of the walls surviving. The
 Church was restored 1000 years ago by 
 Aelfrige, Saxon Lord of Yateley. A    
 Norman Lord enlarged it in the 11th   
 Century. In 1979 an arsonist burned   
 down the church, only the tower and   
 vestry remaining. The Church has been 
 carefully restored and stands as a    
 witness to confirm a continuity of    
 Christian life for a thousand years.
