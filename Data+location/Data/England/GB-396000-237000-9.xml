		<title>09THE FREE CHURCH ASHTON</title>
		<content>   The church came into being in 1881  
 with a congregation of around 50      
 people, some of whom would travel 6   
 miles from Evesham by horse and cart  
 to join the services. The present     
 Chapel was built in 1923 and this year
 (1985) the new hall, which replaces a 
 cosy but dilapidated wooden hut, was  
 officially opened. The congregation at
 present numbers around 90, mainly     
 local inhabitants.                    
   Music plays an important part in the
 worship and on a summer evening many  
 householders stand at their front     
 doors listening to the enthusiastic   
 singing of the congregation. The      
 village is fortunate to have such a   
 lively Christian work, when many      
 Chapels have closed through lack of   
 support and the present generation    
 looks to science and material wealth  
 at the expense of spiritual substance.</content>
