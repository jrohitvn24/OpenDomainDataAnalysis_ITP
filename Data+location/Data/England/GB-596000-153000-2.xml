		<title>02THROWLEY FORSTAL VILLAGE</title>
		<content> Throwley Forstal is the only village  
 in the area. There are two terraces of
 houses. Park Terrace has 8 houses and 
 Jubilee Cottages 9 houses. There are  
 about a dozen other houses grouped    
 around the village green. Some of the 
 houses are converted farm buildings.  
 Pylons carry high voltage electricity 
 over Park Terrace.                    
   There is a pub in the village called
 the Windmill because there used to be 
 a windmill here. There is a small post
 office, but no shops. Although the    
 road crosses the village green there  
 is no bus service.There is a farm     
 where people can buy logs and eggs,   
 while many villagers grow their own   
 vegetables.                           
   The school, which is in its final   
 year, is about half a mile outside the
 village.
