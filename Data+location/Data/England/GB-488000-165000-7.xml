		<content>  {Harmans Water neighbourhood}is an   
 established one, many of it's         
 residents having lived here for twenty
 years or more. Some may have come with
 their parents and grown up here,      
 others were born here. {Employment }  
 brought many people here from London  
 and many other parts of the country.  
                                       
   The long term inhabitants have seen 
 many changes in the area.  Not the    
 least of these is the development of  
 the{Crown Wood}estate, with its much  
 younger populace.  This has come      
 between Harmans Water and its woodland
 walks, as it was built on land which  
 was coniferous forest.                
    Harmans Water has a small but      
 comprehensive{shopping precinct}      
 including a library and hair stylist. 
 The{houses}are a mix of private,      
 council and ex-council.               </content>
