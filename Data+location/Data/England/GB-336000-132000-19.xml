		<content> The area around Middlezoy like much of
 Sedgemoor is criss-crossed with       
 man-made drainage ditches known       
 locally as rhines. Many rare plants   
 grow in and around the rhines, but    
 these have to be cleared from time to 
 time to prevent the ditches from      
 becoming blocked. This did not matter 
 when the ditches were cleared by hand 
 because most plants were able to      
 survive. However, conservationists are
 worried that with the advent of       
 mechanised clearing, larger areas can 
 be cleared more quickly and the plants
 have less chance of survival. The use 
 of herbicides and pesticides also pose
 a threat to the wildlife. As the      
 drainage improves more land is        
 suitable for ploughing. This makes for
 more efficient farming, but means that
 the area will lose its distinctive    
 character.                            </content>
