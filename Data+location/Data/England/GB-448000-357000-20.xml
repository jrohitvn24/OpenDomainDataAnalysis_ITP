		<title>20SUTTON CENTRE COMPLEX.</title>
		<content>   Sutton in Asfield was chosen by     
 Nottinghamshire County Council to be  
 the location of an experiment in      
 Community Education.The Sutton Centre 
 complex houses both a large           
 Comprehensive School and a leisure    
 centre.The school itself was designed 
 as a Community School,with its        
 facilities open to the general public.
 The most interesting facet of this    
 concept is the "eleventh session"-the 
 school is open in the evenings,and    
 classes are run and staffed by the    
 teachers at the school as part of     
 their regular duties.Adults and       
 children alike attend these classes.  
 Situated in the very heart of the     
 town,the school/leisure complex       
 provides excellent facilities and     
 a meeting place for all the people of 
 Sutton. D.LITTLEWOOD.
