		<title>14VILLAGE PUMP FOLK FESTIVAL</title>
		<content> The 12th Village Pump Folk Festival   
 was held at{Stowford Farm}from 19th to
 22nd of July. 1,500 people came       
 and camped along the banks of the     
 River for 4 days of{Country &amp; Western 
{&amp; Folk Music}. The cost to an adult   
 for the event was Â£15. The festival is
 growing annually and attracted several
 "stars" to this peaceful gathering    
 ,besides many visitors from abroad.   
{Stowford Farm and Mill}are            
 historically important and are        
 mentioned in early documents. Nowadays
 people can park their caravans over   
 Winter there .You can buy cream teas  
 and visit a craft centre. Further     
 down the river , just above a small   
 weir, is the{Farleigh Swimming Club } 
 consisting of changing huts and diving
 boards made from scaffolding . We all 
 thought it was cleaner and warmer     
 swimming at Bradford.                 </content>
