		<content> Mr.Furze uses all kinds of spray,     
 such as (roundup),(dicurane) and he   
 uses tilt as a general fungicide.The  
 weather has not been kind to the      
 farmer this year,rain has flattened a 
 lot of his cereal crops.Mr.Furze has  
 450 Large White and Welsh pigs some of
 which are sold for bacon and meat.The 
 pigs are fed on wheat, barley,fish    
 meal,soya beans and minerals that     
 are mixed together and made into      
 pellets.About 15 to 20 pigs are taken 
 to market every Tuesday.              
      The main machinery at Goldstones 
 farm includes 10 tractors,2 combines,1
 beet harvester,2 corn drills,2        
 fertiliser spreaders,and 1 manure     
 spreader.Apart from Mr Furze and his  
 son there are 5 full time and 2 part  
 time workers.In conclusion,Mr.Furze   
 considers that farming in Ashdon is   
 easier these days but more complicated</content>
