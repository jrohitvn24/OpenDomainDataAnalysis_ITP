		<title>11GULVAL CUSTOMS</title>
		<content>{Crying the Neck}is an old custom held 
 at Gulval Churchtown each September.  
 All the corn is cut except for a      
 piece left standing for the vicar to  
 bless. People remember that years ago 
 it was thought that the last bit must 
 be left for the spirit of the corn to 
 live until the next year's harvest.   
                                       
{Gulval Feast}is the Monday nearest to 
 Saint Gudwal's Day in November. It is 
 a school holiday. Village families and
 friends get together for a special    
 meal. The hunt meets at Churchtown.   
 The Master drinks the stirrup cup, and
 the hounds and horses move off to hunt
 a fox.                                
                                       
 Although the{Cornish Language}has not 
 been spoken generally for 200 years, a
 service in Cornish and English is     
 sometimes held at Gulval Church.      </content>
