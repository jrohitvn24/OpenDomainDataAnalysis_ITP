		<title>03THE CROSS CHANNEL TUNNEL</title>
		<content> There would be calls at London,Paris  
 and Brussels but mainly at Cheriton   
 and Sangatte (near Calais).           
                                       
 The proposed cost is between six      
 hundred million and two billion       
 pounds.                               
                                       
 The hoped for construction will begin 
 in 1987 and the tunnel would then be  
 opened between 1991 and 1992.Once     
 opened it should take ten to sixteen  
 years to pay for itself.              
                                       
 There would be two hundred and fifty  
 thousand years of employment shared   
 between the United Kingdom and France.
 Once completed several thousand direct
 and indirect permanent new jobs will  
 be available.
