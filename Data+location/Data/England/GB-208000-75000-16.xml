		<content> TOR DOWN QUARRY IS SITUATED CLOSE TO  
 ST BREWARD SHOP. IT IS A GRANITE      
 QUARRY. IN THE OLD DAYS THERE USED TO 
 BE ABOUT EIGHTY MEN WORKING THERE. ALL
 THESE PEOPLE WERE NEEDED TO HACK OUT  
 THE STONE, CUT IT AND POLISH IT. THIS 
 PROVIDED MOST OF THE  EMPLOYMENT FOR  
 THE VILLAGE. A NEAR BY STREAM WAS     
 DIVERTED TO PROVIDE WATER FOR USE IN  
 THE QUARRY. WATER WAS USED  FOR       
 WASHING THE STONE BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY
 IT POWERED A TURBINE ENGINE WHICH WAS 
 USED TO CUT AND POLISH THE GRANITE.   
 ALL THE LABOUR WAS DONE BY HAND BUT   
 NOW THEY USE DIAMOND SAWS,DIGGERS,    
 CRANES AND COMPRESSERS. NOW ONLY 4    
 PEOPLE ARE ENPLOYED AT TOR DOWN       
 QUARRY. THE SCULPTOR DAVID WYNN WORKED
 ON HIS GIGANTIC MARBLE STATUE OF A    
 BROWN BEAR AT THE QUARRY. THE STATUE  
 WENT TO NEW YORK FOR THE PEPSI COLA   
 COMPANY.                              </content>
