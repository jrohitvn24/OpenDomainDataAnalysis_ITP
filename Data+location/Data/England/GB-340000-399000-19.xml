		<content> Newspapers nowadays exaggerate a lot. 
 Many people think that they say things
 which they shouldn't or add things on 
 to stories which might not be true.   
 This is especially the case with the  
 Royal family. Newspapers are always   
 writing things about them and it must 
 be really hard for all members of the 
 Royal family.They cannot go anywhere  
 without being hounded by the press. A 
 good recent example of this is        
 Princess Michael of Kent. She has     
 suffered terribly because of the      
 accusations made against her father,  
 who had been a member of Hitlers SS.  
 Television news tends to be a little  
 better because it usually just deals  
 with the facts.Television is not too  
 bad in England and most of our        
 programmes are better than the        
 American ones we import.
