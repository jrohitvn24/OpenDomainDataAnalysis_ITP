		<title>01Tetchill,Hordley &amp; Frankton</title>
		<content>   The area consists  of three  hamlets
 of widely  differing  characteristics.
  Tetchill is  the largest of the three
 and,while it has some old buildings,it
 consists mostly of newer bungalows and
 houses.These include a small  close of
 brick council houses.                 
  Hordley is a  more traditional hamlet
 consisting of old buildings built from
 stone or bricks and timber.           
  Lower Frankton is centred  on the old
 canal junction and most buildings date
 from when this was an  important route
 centre. No services  remain  from this
 bygone  era and  all  houses  are  now
 residential. Most  of  these  are very
 small  cottages  and  many  have  been
 extended   with  varying   degrees  of
 sympathy for the original building.   
  Outside the  hamlets  can  be found a
 series  of isolated farmsteads  spaced
 at approximately 300m. intervals.     </content>
