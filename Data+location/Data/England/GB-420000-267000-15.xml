Most of the people in this area go to  
Church regularly, every Sunday. Not    
many people go to discos or night-     
clubs.                                 
The old people in the area of Hatton   
Green like to be sociable and enjoy    
spending their money, playing cards    
and gambling.While most of the people  
stay in in the evening, the old tend   
to go for short strolls.               
Only the children and teenagers are in 
fashion.                               
Children spend most of their time      
out of doors, playing around on the    
farm or out in the countryside.        
Teenagers spend most of their time at  
discos and in Warwick and Leamington.  
There are no punks or people with      
weird hairstyles.
