		<title>0420th. CENTURY CHANGES</title>
		<content>    The villages have undergone several
 changes this century. Motorised       
 transport made better roads necessary.
 Grass tracks &amp; stone chipping roads   
 were replaced by tarmac surfaced      
 roads. Machinery has altered farming  
 methods. Many hedges disappeared to   
 enlarge fields &amp; facilitate the use of
 machinery. This can be detrimental to 
 wild life.                            
    Several small cottages have been   
 demolished or combined to create      
 larger residences. A blacksmith's shop
 was closed when its services were no  
 longer needed &amp; three village shops   
 closed. The original Hams Hall was    
 destroyed by fire in 1890. A          
 replacement building was eventually   
 removed to become Bledisloe Lodge,    
 Gloucestershire. Lea Marston School   
 closed, Nether Whitacre School has    
 been threatened with closure.         </content>
