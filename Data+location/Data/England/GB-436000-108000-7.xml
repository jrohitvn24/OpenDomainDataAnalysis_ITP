		<title>07Horticultural Fete,Marchwood</title>
		<content> Marchwood has had a horticultural fete
 annually since 1923.It has games,     
 stalls and competitions.Years ago they
 used to 'bowl for a pig'.You had to   
 roll a ball at some skittles.At the   
 end of the day the person who had     
 knocked the most skittles down won the
 pig.In those days a pig was worth a   
 lot of money.                         
        After each fete all the profits
 went to the church and school         
 funds.Games were always there and     
 still are today.'Put the ball in the  
 hole' games were quite popular.Small  
 balls were rolled across a board to   
 miss or go down holes.Competitions    
 often involved aiming or shooting at  
 goals.                                
       It all started as just a        
 horticultural show,but now it is the  
 main social event in the village and  
 it is still going strong.             </content>
