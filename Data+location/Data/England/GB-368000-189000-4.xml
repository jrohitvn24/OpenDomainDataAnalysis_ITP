		<title>04The Church and the Rector</title>
		<content> The present Rector has been in        
 Cromhall for two years. He comes from 
 Wales, and has already had twelve     
 homes. His job is to care for all the 
 people in the parish. He looks after  
 the parishes of Cromhall, Tortworth   
 and Tytherington. He prays every day  
 for his parishioners, each of whom he 
 names. He conducts services, visits   
 the sick and housebound, marries,     
 buries and baptizes people. Generally 
 he is the agent of God in Cromhall.   
 His working day begins at 7am and     
 often continues until 10.30pm. He     
 regrets that the people of Cromhall   
 are not very religious. Out of a      
 population of about eight hundred, the
 average attendance at St Andrews      
 Church is between sixty and seventy.He
 feels people don't make enough time   
 for God. He became a Rector because   
 God wanted him to.                    </content>
