		<content>  We visited a school to ask some      
 children about their villages. We     
 asked them if they knew any old wives 
 tales. Here are some of the more      
 interesting ones we were told of.     
    They say that when you are         
 pregnant if you eat{strawberries}then 
 your baby will have a mark of a       
 strawberry. This must cause some      
 concern in a fruit-growing area such  
 as ours!                              
    The well-known superstition about  
 it being bad luck to walk under       
 a ladder is offered a solution in this
 area. When you come out from under the
 ladder you should cross your fingers  
 in order to regain good luck.         
    If you find a pot of salt upset on 
 a table you should pick a pinch up and
 throw it over your shoulder. What good
 this does you is unclear!
