   We interviewed the licencee of "The 
Woodman" who has been at the pub for   
nearly four years. "The Woodman" is    
openfrom 10.00am to 2.30pm and from    
6.00pm to 11.00pm. Six people help to  
run the pub, some of them working      
part-time. It was built in about 1600  
and has always been an inn. The most   
expensive drink is Swiss beer and the  
cheapest is orange squash. The most    
popu drink is bitter beer.             
   The publican also sells food,       
crisps, nuts sandwiches and sometimes  
coffee. He keeps 1500 pints of beer in 
the cellar which lasts just over a     
week. Beer is delivered weekly.        
Darts,dominoes and cribbage are played 
and there is a fruit machine. Pets are 
allowed in the pub, mostly dogs. Some  
of the Kent Cricket Team visit the pub.
