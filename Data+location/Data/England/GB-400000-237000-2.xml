		<title>02      ST. MARY'S CHURCH</title>
		<content>                                       
 St. Mary's is a very old church part  
 of which probably dates back to Saxon 
 times.  Some of the grave stones are  
 so old that they have sunk halfway    
 into the ground.  The lych-gate is    
 where people put the coffins down and 
 had a rest.  Inside the church the    
 seats are wooden and there are a lot  
 of stained glass windows.  There is a 
 war memorial outside.  To the left of 
 the church is the rectory where the   
 rector, Rev. Johnston-Hubbold lives.  
 The church has a weather cock on the  
 spire which can be seen from many     
 points within our grid.
