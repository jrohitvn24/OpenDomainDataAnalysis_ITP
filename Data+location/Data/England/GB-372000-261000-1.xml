		<title>01Description of The Shelsleys</title>
		<content>   This is an area of great natural    
 beauty;steep hills on each side of the
{River Teme}which flows from north to  
 south. Cottages and larger houses are 
 dotted among the hills,each one with  
 its own beautiful view, to Clee Hill  
 in the north and Malvern Hills in the 
 south. These houses are reached by    
 steep narrow lanes, frequently blocked
 by snow in winter. Perhaps because of 
 this traditional isolation, the       
 "Valley" feels itself cut off, and    
 does not really mix with the          
 inhabitants of nearby Great Witley,   
 Clifton-on-Teme, or Martley.          
   Life is peaceful in The Shelsleys   
 apart from the three Hill Climb       
 fixtures a year. Only air-force jets, 
 the occasional Hercules transport     
 plane, agricultural machinery or      
 sometimes a blast from the quarry     
 disturb the peace.                    </content>
