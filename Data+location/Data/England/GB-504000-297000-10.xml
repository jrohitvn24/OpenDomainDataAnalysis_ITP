		<title>10WANSFORD VILLAGE HALL</title>
		<content>                                       
  The Village Hall has many uses. There
 are events that happen yearly and ones
 that are weekly.                      
  There is a flower show held once a   
 year in Wansford and most villagers   
 are involved with that. The Women's   
 Institute use the hall once a year for
 a dinner, as do the Horticultural     
 Society and the Evergreens.           
  Several groups meet regularly in the 
 Hall, like the playgroup which takes  
 place 4 times a week. The youth club  
 meets once a week, usually on Fridays 
 or Saturdays. The people who hire out 
 the hall pay a cost: the price depends
 on whoever is using the hall.         
  The hall costs more if it is being   
 used for commercial purposes _ wedding
 receptions and private parties, for   
 example _ but if used by local groups 
 it will cost less.                    </content>
