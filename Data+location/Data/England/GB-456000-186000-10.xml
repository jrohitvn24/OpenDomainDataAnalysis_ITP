		<content>{Netball} is a game normally played by 
two teams of girls on a court 100 feet 
long and 50 feet wide. The object is to
score goals by throwing the ball       
through a net at the top of a pole. The
players must stand still whilst holding
the ball and pass it from player to    
player until it is possible to take a  
shot at goal. The team scoring the most
goals will be the winner.              
{Stickers} are pieces of card with glue
on the back. They come in various      
shapes, sizes and colours, and can be  
stuck to almost any surface. I stick   
some of mine neatly into a book so that
I can count them. I started collecting 
stickers when I saw them in a shop and 
thought the looked attractive. I now   
spend about half of my pocket money    
each week on stickers.
