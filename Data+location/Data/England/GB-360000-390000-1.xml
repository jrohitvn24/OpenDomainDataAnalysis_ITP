		<content> St.Stephen's R.C.Aided Primary School 
 opens in September 1985 after the     
 amalgamation of the Infant plus       
 Nursery School with the Junior School.
 When this school opened it was a full 
 Primary School but as the population  
 grew it had to be split into two      
 schools.Now as the population shrinks 
 it is necessary to reamalgamate       
 in order to have sufficient staff to  
 to offer a full curriculum.This inform
 ation was compiled by several         
 pupils of the Junior School helped by 
 Mr.Hammill the headteacher. We are not
 used to computers which are just      
 finding their way into schools but we 
 have enjoyed writing our thoughts onto
 the B.B.C. micro which we use for this
 project. We study lots of things      
 including Maths, English,Nature,      
 History,Geography Science,Music,Arts, 
 Crafts,Physical Education,Games,Health</content>
