		<title>12South Denes Power Station</title>
		<content> The South Denes Power Station was     
 completed in 1957 as an oil fired one,
 although originally intended to be    
 coal fired. The Denes site between the
 river Yare and the North Sea was an   
 advantage for several reasons. In the 
 first place fuel oil could be imported
 from the Thames Estuary refineries    
 such as the Isle of Grain into the    
 harbour from which water for steam    
 raising could be obtained. The        
 slightly warm water used in           
 condensation could then be returned to
 the sea several hundred metres off    
 shore. Peak power production was in   
 the 1960s and early 70s supplying the 
 London area at high demand times. In  
 recent years production has declined, 
 apart from high output during the     
 Miner's Strike of 1984/5, and the     
 station was finally closed down in    
 Autumn 1985.                          </content>
