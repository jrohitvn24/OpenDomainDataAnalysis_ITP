		<content>'On the 1st. June it was my birthday   
and I was 11. I had about 17 cards. Two
of my cards had Freddie Spencer, the   
famous motorcyclist on. The night      
before I couldn't get to sleep with the
excitement.  In the morning I heard the
mail come through the door and it was  
all for me. In the end I was given 13  
pounds in money to spend but there were
more cards to come. My Mum and Dad were
going to take me to the Beefeater,     
which is a restaurant just outside     
Ashford. We hired a Ford Sierra car    
just for the occasion.'
