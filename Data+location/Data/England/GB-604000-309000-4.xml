		<title>04General Questionnaire Data.</title>
		<content> The following points emerged from     
 a general questionnaire distributed in
 Mattishall on July 10th.1985:         
    The majority of inhabitants came   
 here from Norwich,many others came    
 from Essex.The main reason for coming 
 here was the husband's job.Most people
 have lived here between ten and twenty
 years,a few have lived here all their 
 lives.Almost all the residents like   
 the village,because it is pleasant,   
 friendly and convenient for Norwich   
 and Dereham.Not many complaints were  
 registered,but litter and dog faeces  
 were mentioned.Very few residents     
 actually work in the village,those    
 that do are mostly women (housewives) 
 working (often part-time) as          
 cleaners,shop-assistants etc.The      
 village is seen as having changed     
 greatly with new housing development  
 recently."No more,"say the residents! </content>
