		<title>10MOSQUE AFTER SCHOOL,PRESTON</title>
		<content>   From Monday to Friday we have to go 
 to the{Mosque}at 5:00 p.m.On Monday at
 the Mosque, we have to go in and go to
 our class and sit in our place.We have
 to start praying as soon as we sit.   
 When our teacher comes he sits down.We
 move to different classes each year.  
  These are some rules:we can't look up
 at anyone coming in at the door; we've
 got to sort of kneel and sit;we have  
 to pray the holy{Koran}quickly without
 mistake.Our teacher listens to us all.
 Then we pray our Khitabh.From the     
 Khitabh we get some homework to learn 
 for the next day.After, we pray more  
 things by heart.                      
   On other days it's just the same.   
 Except on Friday when our nails should
 be cut and we have to take our fees.  
 We do Urdu homework as well.          
    We finish at 7:30 p.m.We go out of 
 the Mosque to wait for our lifts home.</content>
