		<content> He first came to Elwell near West     
 Buckland 40 years ago when he rented  
 the farm. He now owns it but it is    
 worked for him.It is 70 acres and     
 divided into 13 fields. He has 35     
 milking cows,40 store cattle and 80   
 sheep.He buys corn and cow cake but   
 grows the rest of the animal feed.He  
 used to have one tractor and horses.He
 now has three International and 1     
 Zetor tractor  and 1 Range Rover.He   
 enjoyed life as a farmer and found the
 main problem was the weather.He found 
 hedges a problem because he had to    
 keep repairing them.People walking    
 dogs across his land was a small      
 problem.He retired in 1977 and enjoys 
 not having to work.
