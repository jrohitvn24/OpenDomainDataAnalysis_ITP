		<title>17ASTWICK</title>
		<content>   Astwick is the smallest parish in   
 England.It is joined with             
 Arlesey,though is closer to Stotfold.A
 very picturesque hamlet it covers 665 
 acres,flanking the River Ivel.The A1  
 trunk road forms it's eastern         
 boundary.                             
   In the past Stotfold and Astwick    
 were separated by a marshy            
 "no-man's-land",but now they are      
 linked by a road.It has a church and  
 several farms and a mill.             
{ASTWICK MILL.                         
  This water mill stands on the banks  
 of the River Ivel.The structure of the
 mill and the millhouse as it stands   
 today was largely built in the mid    
 eighteenth century.The mill has an    
 attractive garden on the banks of the 
 river. Unfortunately the river is     
 polluted for large stretches.
