 In Sandridge there are only 2 shops   
 and 1 post office. Mr Auckland, the   
 postmaster, is due to retire later    
 this year.The Head post office        
 decided that there was no point in    
 getting someone else to take over the 
 job and the post office was due to    
 close. Local people were very angry   
 about this because the old people of  
 the village would have to go to St.   
 Albans to collect their pensions, as  
 would mothers with young children.The 
 post office is a village meeting      
 place; without it Sandridge would     
 become even less of a village. There  
 were many articles and letters in     
 the newspapers. One parish councillor 
 collected over 500 signatures for a   
 petition. This was successful and so  
 the post office will be retained at   
 the end of the year.                  </content>
