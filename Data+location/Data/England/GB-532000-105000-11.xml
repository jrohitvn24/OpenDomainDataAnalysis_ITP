		<title>11BRIGHTON'S OLDEST HOUSE</title>
		<content> The house is called the Monks House.  
 It is a cottage with 2 rooms upstairs 
 and 2 rooms downstairs. People do not 
 live in the cottage now, but it is    
 used for people to have a drink. Down 
 in the cellar there is  a well, people
 think that a person once fell down it 
 and became a ghost. Her  name was the 
 "Lady  in Grey" ! The doors to the old
 cottage are very small which indicates
 that the people in those days must    
 have been small to get through the    
 them. In the cottage there is an oven 
 which is not like the ovens we use    
 today. Near the cottage there is a    
 barn and some of the wood used to make
 the barn came from a ship in the      
 Spanish Armada. In the cellars,       
 where they stored wine,the ceiling is 
 coming down. The windows are made from
 small panes of glass, &amp; to open them  
 you slide the whole frame back.       </content>
