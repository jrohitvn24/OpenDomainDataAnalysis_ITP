  The River Penk runs northwards       
 through the centre of the block       
 occupying a gently sloping valley.    
  There are also a few tributaries of  
 this river.                           
 Most of the survey block is used for  
 arable farming as it is fairly fertile
 land.                                 
  The block is sparsely populated.Most 
 of the people live in Brewood.The only
 other settlements are small hamlets,  
 isolated houses, and farms.           
  The main occupation in the area is   
 farming. There is hardly any industry 
 so many of the working people commute 
 to Wolverhampton and other large      
 towns.It is a very quiet area and the 
 residents like it the way it is.
