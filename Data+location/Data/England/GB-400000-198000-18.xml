 is the Talland School of Equitation.  
 The school's horses,kept in 52 loose  
 boxes and stalls have the use of 42.5 
 hectares of near by fields leased from
 Lord Bathurst.In Summer many horses   
 live in these fields.During this time 
 pupils attend courses in the dressage 
 and jumping arenas,two covered riding 
 areas and on the cross-country course.
 Overseas and long stay students are   
 boarded with local families,at Church 
 Farm or at Talland House.Many local   
 children and adults learn to ride here
 too all year round.The cost is Â£3.45  
 per hour.There are pony helpers and 4 
 instructors.Students are expected,as  
 part of their training,to look after  
 their own ponies.Children are asked to
 join the Pony Club and join in such   
 events as gymkhana rallies and hunting
