		<title>04 MARTLESHAM CHURCH</title>
		<content>                                       
Martlesham Church is a typical example 
of a well-cared-for Suffolk Church.It  
stands on the site of a church         
mentioned in the first Doomsday Survey.
  The church was built on top of a hill
over-looking the River Deben.There must
have been a good view of invaders      
sailing up the river. Now the church is
surrounded by trees.                   
 Inside the church is an ancient mural 
of St.Christopher carrying the Christ  
Child.It was painted in the year 1400. 
There is an old chest which used to    
hold the communion silver.It has a     
hollowed out poplar tree trunk as a    
lid. The chest was rescued from the    
Rectory stables in 1859 where it had   
been used as a corn bin!               
 In the grave yard we found some tomb  
stones dating back to 1771.
