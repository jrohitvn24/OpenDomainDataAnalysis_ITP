		<content> David Mumford became Priest-in-Charge 
 of St.Mary's,Therfield and St.Faith's,
 Kelshall in 1983.Whilst a great deal  
 of time is taken up in administrative 
 duties of the parish,priority is given
 to visiting people in their homes ,to 
 get to know them and to and form      
 ongoing relationships. The usual      
 community provides an envirroment for 
 building bridges towards the          
 acknowledgement of God's Kingdom      
 through the workings of His Holy      
 Spirit,in creating the feeling of the 
 family of God within our village.The  
 main focus of worship has been on the 
 Eucharist. Now Children's church,house
 and prayer groups are included to     
 extend the promotion of the Gospel of 
 Jesus Christ.Churchwardens lead an    
 active Church Council. Many           
 parishioners give their time freely in
 maintaining the church &amp; churchyard.  </content>
