		<title>07Weeton Toddlers'/Play Group</title>
		<content>     The Weeton village{Mothers' and   
{Toddlers' Group,}formed in 1984, was  
 the idea of the vicar's wife. It began
 with five children and their mothers  
 meeting twice a week in the village   
 hall. Now 17 adults and 20 children   
 meet twice a month.                   
                                       
     The children move later into the  
{Playgroup,}which meets every Friday   
 afternoon in the village school. At   
 present there are l6 children.        
                                       
     The groups meet a real social need
 and are much appreciated by the       
 parents, the Toddlers' Group in       
 particular providing a welcome meeting
 place for the mothers.
