		<content>{Mr.Ron Green}has been associated      
 with the Club for many years, being   
 treasurer for some fifteen years.     
  'The Club started 28 Years ago by    
 employees who formed a fishing Club   
 later they raised money to start a    
 Social Club. Hiams agreed to support  
 this venture by later donating a      
 building on land just outside         
 Prickwillow. Over the years we have   
 had some famous Dance bands like the  
 Marmalade and the Baron Knights.      
  We are one of the few Clubs in a 30  
 mile radius where you can get live    
 entertainment and Ballroom dancing    
 every Saturday night. Members come    
 from as far as Biggleswade.There are  
 not enough members in Prickwillow to  
 keep it going.                        
 The Club is open during the week days 
 for Darts, Dominoes, Bingo and Bowls  
 depending on the time of year'.       </content>
