		<content> I think that Gateway supermarket is   
 quite useful and it sells essential   
 things and one bit of the shop sells  
 medicines.I think that the bakery     
 isn't very important and there are    
 loads in Norton. I think there ought  
 to be a bank in its place. I think    
 that the wool shop isn't very         
 important because you could go without
 wool.I think a post office would be   
 more useful. The butcher's is very    
 good because we need meat everyday.   
 The newsagent is a very good one it   
 sells alot of other things as well as 
 sweets.Also there's a greengrocer's   
 which I think is unnecessary because  
 you can get fruit and vegetables at   
 Gateway.Across the road there's a good
 but expensive hairdresser's.Next door 
 to that there is a pub called the     
 Centenary. It's handy because there's 
 a bar and a restaurant.               </content>
