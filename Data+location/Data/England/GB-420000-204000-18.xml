		<title>18FARMING IN FILKINS AREA</title>
		<content>4 farms were visited within the area - 
one of these is owner-farmed, one leas-
ed from owner and 2 are managed for    
owner. Sizes vary from 120 to 1500     
acres. All considered themselves to be 
mixed farmers. They grow winter and    
spring barley, wheat, oil seed rape,   
oats, peas, turnips, fodder beet and   
tricale- a rye/wheat grain for dry     
lands. Grass is grown for both perman- 
ent pasture and grass leys and there is
some rough pasture and sanfoin. A      
small area is woodland.                
Stock is kept in very different ways at
different farms. One farmer farms an   
intensive pig unit with l,000 pigs,    
raising bacon stock in 5 months, whilst
another keeps 45 free range pigs, mar- 
keting at 4 months. In the first case, 
the pigs are fed partly on bought-in   
food while the free range pigs are fed 
on home-raised grain and peas          </content>
