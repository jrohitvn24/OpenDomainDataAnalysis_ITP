		<title>10ATTITUDES IN CROSTON</title>
		<content> Most people are concerned about the   
{heavy traffic}which passes through on 
 the narrow roads of Croston to and    
 from Chorley. Parking is permitted on 
 both sides of the roads in order to   
 slow down the traffic.Public{transport
 is considered poor and expensive with 
 insufficient buses at night.          
 Most established families are not     
 concerned about the influence of{new- 
{comers}during the last 15 yrs although
 some feel that{new housing}is spoiling
 the character of the village.         
{Parents}of schoolchildren are worried 
 about{unemployment}and some feel there
 should be more{schools}in the area.   
 It is considered a{law-abiding}village
 with adequate police presence but some
 concern about minor{vandalism}and{teen
{-agers}being a nuisance.{Young people 
 feel there is not enough going on and 
 isolated due to lack of transport.    </content>
