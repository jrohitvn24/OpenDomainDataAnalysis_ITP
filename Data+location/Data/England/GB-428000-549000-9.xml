		<title>09FARMING - A LOCAL FARM.</title>
		<content>{Mr.T.Morralee's  RIDING FARM }is  just
 one  of the  farms  around Lumley. The
 17th century farmhouse was part of the
 Lumley  Castle  Estate. The  land  was
 bought in the 1920's by the N.C.B. for
 coal production,but the present farmer
 is still a tenant of Lord Scarborough.
 The farm covers  250 acres,  producing
 potatoes, turnips, wheat(100 acres for
 bread -goes to a  Tyne mill),  oilseed
 rape (profitable,and a good "cleaning"
 crop-sent to Rotterdam), and grass for
 silage.During the Winter,85 cows calve
 here, then  move in  Spring to a  hill
 farm 18 miles away.There are also  550
 ewes  brought down from the  hill farm
 in Spring  to  produce  830 lambs. The
 farmer begins work at 6.30 a.m. and he
 and three others work a 7-day week. He
 owns  8 tractors and finds  the  round
 baler invaluable. Our E.E.C.membership
 has been of benefit to him. {R.Taylor.</content>
