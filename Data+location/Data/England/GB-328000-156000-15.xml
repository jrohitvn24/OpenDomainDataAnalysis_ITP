		<title>15BREAN DOWN AND TRANSPORT</title>
		<content>   THE HISTORY OF BREAN DOWN AND ITS   
USE AS A FORT HAS ALREADY BEEN         
RECORDED.ITS PLACE IN THE HISTORY OF   
TRANSPORT AND FUTURE TRANSPORT IS THE  
SUBJECT OF THIS PAGE.                  
   WHEN THE RAILWAYS REACHED SOMERSET, 
A GROUP OF LOCAL PEOPLE LOOKED WESTWARD
AND HAD VISIONS OF ESTABLISHING A      
HARBOUR ON THE NORTH OF THE DOWN.IT    
WOULD HAVE BEEN THE NEAREST BRITISH    
PORT TO AMERICA.WORK STARTED BUT WAS   
WRECKED BY GALES WHICH NOT ONLY        
DEMOLISHED THE WORK BEGUN,BUT ALSO SANK
THE PROJECT.                           
   IN RECENT YEARS THE POSSIBILITY OF A
BARRAGE FROM BREAN DOWN BY THE WAY OF  
STEEPHOLME,AND FLATHOLME TO LAVENACK   
POINT IN SOUTH WALES HAS BEEN WELL     
RESEARCHED.SUCH SCHEME WOULD NOT ONLY  
USE THE TIDE TO PROVIDE MUCH NEEDED    
ELECTRICITY BUT ALSO A ROAD LINKING THE
SOUTH WEST OF ENGLAND TO SOUTH WALES.  </content>
