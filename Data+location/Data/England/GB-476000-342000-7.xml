		<title>07The Ecology round Alverton</title>
		<content> The ecology of the area includes quite
 a bit of water based habitat.There is 
 1 main river running through which is 
 called the Smite and is well stocked  
 with freshwater fish which inturn     
 attracts birds like kingfisher,heron, 
 coots,moorhen and wildfowl.A disused  
 quarry now flooded also attracts a    
 variety of birds such as geese,grebes,
 ducks,snipe,curlew and sanderlings.The
 area is also rich in with meadow and  
 woodland birds as well as mammals such
 as squirrel,fox,rodents,rabbits and   
 occasional badger.The climate is      
 moderate in rainfall and warmth which 
 is ideal for the many cereal crops    
 grown in the area.There are many      
 streams and footpaths which cover the 
 area but recently large areas of      
 hedgerow have been removed especially 
 at Flawborough which has made the     
 farmland open and bare looking.       </content>
