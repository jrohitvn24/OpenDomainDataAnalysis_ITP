		<content>Our school has four classes which are  
Infant,Transition,Junior 1,Junior 2.The
school name is Oakley Parochial        
Combined School which means it is a    
Parish school for children aged        
5-11.There are two playgrounds,one for 
boys and one for girls.We have a big   
playing field on which we play         
rounders,football and tennis.          
On Monday 1 July we are having our     
School Sports for which the green,red  
and blue teams race against each other 
to win a cup.We have an outdoor heated 
swimming pool and on Tuesday some of   
the Ickford children come to use it.   
In April,some of the 2nd,3rd and 4th   
years went to Wales for a week on      
school journey.                        
There are two gym clubs in school,both 
on Thursday.One is for infants at      
lunch-time, the other is for Juniors   
after school.                          </content>
