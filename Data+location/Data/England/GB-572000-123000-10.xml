  {Local History}This firm was founded 
 in 1792 by John Steyning.The site at  
 Brightling Road was acquired around   
 1885 to gain easy acces to the        
 railway.                              
  {Industry}Until 1947 the numbers     
 employed in the sawmill were          
 approximately 15.The machinery was    
 relatively simple,powered by steam.In 
 1947 a modern band-mill was installed 
 and all machinery was electrically    
 driven.Further expansion took place in
 the early 1960's when adjoining land  
 was purchased.The enlarged and        
 modernised mill employed up to 80     
 people and was capable of cutting up  
 to 20,000 cubic feet of round timber  
 per week.                             
  {Economics}The economic climate      
 recently has cut output and therefore 
 employment.Trade is mostly oak-board. </content>
