		<title>13MADELEY STAFFS : CRIME</title>
		<content> As far as reported crime is concerned,
this area of Madeley is very lawabiding
 The main offences are:-minor damage,  
petty theft from cars and burglaries   
from business premises.The offenders   
are mostly youngsters.There is also a  
little poaching.Villagers complain of  
young folk gathering,making noise with 
there motor-bikes,though this is legal.
Advice on crime prevention is available
to anyone.Local police sometimes visit 
schools in the area.In summer,the      
police helped by volunteers,run the    
Staffs Police Activity &amp; Community ent-
erprise scheme -SPACE- for the 10-16's.
They offer fishing,sport,pleasure trips
&amp; discos.They also run a youth club in 
winter.This explains the lack of major 
crime here-&amp; the central site of the   
police station!Anyone unlucky enough to
be arrested is detained in Newcastle   
station,where the courts are at hand.  </content>
