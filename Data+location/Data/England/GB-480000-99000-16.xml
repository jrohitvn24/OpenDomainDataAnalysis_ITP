		<content> I am a ten year old girl. At 8.00     
 o'clock I get up and put on a blue &amp;  
 white checked dress and royal blue    
 sweat shirt, my school uniform. I run 
 downstairs &amp; have beakfast of a cereal
 and fried egg. My younger sister &amp; I  
 walk to school. I take the milk       
 cartons into the school hall and get  
 them ready for lunch time. I go to my 
 class for registration. I take my     
 recorder to play at assembly where we 
 have a talk, a hymn &amp; prayers. We have
 4 periods of lessons each day. Between
 them we have breaks. We go out if it  
 is fine &amp; play and talk with our      
 friends. At lunchtim we go into our   
 hall afer washing our hands and get   
 our lunch from the hatch. School ends 
 at 3.20 p.m. I go home with my sister 
 and have tea. After tea I play or     
 watch television.
