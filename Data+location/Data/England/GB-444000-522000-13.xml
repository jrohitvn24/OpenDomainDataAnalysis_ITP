		<title>13Billingham Art Gallery</title>
		<content> The Art Gallery was built next to the 
 Council Offices. The aim was to give  
 the local population the chance to see
 visiting art Exhibitions.There are two
 galleries. The main gallery is 62 feet
 by 42 feet and the small one, 42 feet 
 by 18 feet. This is only used for     
 large exhibitions. The entrance to the
 gallery is up a white marble spiral   
 staircase. There is space for up to   
 200 pictures. About 100 people visit  
 the gallery every day. There are      
 security cameras and no smoking or    
 eating is allowed. It is quiet as     
 people look at the pictures.          
 Exhibitions are displayed for 6 or 7  
 weeks. Sometimes pottery is displayed 
 in the centre of the gallery.         
 Exhibitions are booked months in      
 advance and are chosen by the Museum  
 Curator of Stockton.
