		<content> Entertainment which is common in urban
 areas is not to be found in our area, 
 so it is left to local people to form 
 their own clubs and other             
 organisations, which become a way of  
 life vital to the existence of the    
 village as well as individuals. There 
 are a number of youth organisations   
 such as Young Farmers, a youth club,  
 playgroup, cubs, brownies and girl    
 guides. The women have a Mother's     
 Union and a Women's Institute. The men
 have Freemasons, the Ante-diluvian    
 Order of Buffaloes, a cricket club,   
 and in winter a football club and     
 darts team. These sports clubs, along 
 with the bowls and croquet club have  
 extensive use of the recreation       
 ground. There is a Parish Council,    
 Church Council, Stage Society, Dancing
 Club, Walking Club, Wednesday Club,   
 Esthwaite Fellowship and Yoga.        </content>
