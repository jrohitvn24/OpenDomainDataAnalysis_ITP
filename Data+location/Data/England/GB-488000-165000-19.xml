		<title>19ASCOT RESIDENT INTERVIEW.</title>
		<content>   We interviewed an{elderly lady}who  
 has been living on the{Bouldish Farm} 
{Estate, South Ascot}for twenty-seven  
 years.  She lives alone in a          
 two-storey block of{flats}occupied    
 mainly by  retired couples. Her       
 accommodation is rented from the      
{Council}and includes a living room, a 
 bedroom, a bathroom, a kitchenette and
 a small hall.  She furnished the flat 
 herself and pays for the  lighting and
 heating.  The Council is responsible  
 for basic repairs and redecoration.   
                                       
  {Living alone}is difficult for       
 elderly people here, because there is 
 no local Doctor or Dentist and no     
 Community Hall.  The{shops}with more  
 choice of goods are in Ascot, a bus   
 ride away, and the{bus service}is     
 infrequent. The Mobile Library calls  
 once a week.                          </content>
