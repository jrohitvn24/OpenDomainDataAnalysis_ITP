		<title>11THE VILLAGE OF PICA</title>
		<content> Mr&amp;Mrs Blenkingsop were born in Pica,a
 small community of 90 houses.Mrs      
 Blenkingsops sister still lives there.
 Pica was built for the coal mine      
 called Oaklands Colliery  which       
 belonged to the Lowther Estate.The    
 stone for the houses was quarried next
 to the village the quarry is now a    
 playground.Pica is another name for a 
 magpie and its thought that this is   
 where the village got its name.The    
 Blenkingsops went to Dyon Council     
 school.The school is still there but  
 it is split up into two houses.There  
 was a cooperative shop and three      
 sweet shops.There was a playing field 
 next to the school but there is a     
 bungalow built on it now.There were 5 
 teachers at the school and 120        
 children.The mine closed in 1933.
