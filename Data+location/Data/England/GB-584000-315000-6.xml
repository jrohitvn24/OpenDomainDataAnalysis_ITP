		<content> The area attracts a share of{tourism  
 and one of the most attractive        
 features to be found in the{landscape 
 is the lake on the River Nar at East  
 Lexham. This was man made as a fish   
 farm centuries ago, but has now       
 largely become natural.During July    
 1985 it measured approximately 150    
 metres long and 20 metres wide.It was 
 estimated to be 3 metres deep at the  
 centre.In the water there can be found
 a variety of fish including trout,    
 tench and carp.People use the lake for
{recreation}as fishing licences can be 
 obtained from Lexham Hall estate.     
 Although some evidence of pollution   
 was found in the form of an old car   
 battery and litter, in general the    
{ecology}is well protected.
