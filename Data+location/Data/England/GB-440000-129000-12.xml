		<title>12CHANGING TIMES,SPARSHOLT.</title>
		<content>  We interviewed Mrs. Stockwell who has
 lived in Sparsholt all her life.She   
 was born in 1902 and came to the local
 school in 1907,she left at the age of 
 14.She then worked at the local post  
 office,which was built in 1875 and    
 closed in 1985,in between those years 
 Mrs.Stockwell's great grandmother was 
 the first person to sell stamps in    
 Sparsholt.                            
  If you wanted to go into Winchester  
 you had to walk,but now you can go by 
 bus,car or bike.Mrs.Stockwell's father
 used to be the village baker and the  
 bread was delivered in a pony trap.   
  Next door to the old post office is  
 the well house which was built in 1897
 for Queen Victoria's Jubilee.Before   
 the village was connected to the mains
 water supply,the local people had     
 to collect their water from the well  
 house.                                </content>
