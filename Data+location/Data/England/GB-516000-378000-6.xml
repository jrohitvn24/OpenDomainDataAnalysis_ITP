		<title>06ECOLOGY IN PANTON</title>
		<content>  A very controversial subject both    
 nationally and locally is that of     
 straw burning. Straw burning takes    
 place at {PANTON }as soon as possible 
 after the crops have been harvested.  
 ON heavy clays, this is done to give a
 good natural weed-control, kill off   
 dormant slugs which can destroy the   
 newly-planted crop, and incorporated  
 ash helps in the nutrition of the     
 tilth. Under the present code farmers 
 may not now burn straw at week-ends or
 at night or on Bank holidays. They    
 must also make a cultivated strip     
 round the edges of the fields to stop 
 fire spreading to hedges. Burning in  
 some parts of the country has caused  
 traffic accidents. Smuts hang in the  
 air and opponents to burning argue    
 that valuable energy is being wasted, 
 wildlife is being harmed and that the 
 stubble should be ploughed in.        </content>
