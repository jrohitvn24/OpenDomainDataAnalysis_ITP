		<title>01VIEW OF THE SOUTH HAMS</title>
		<content>     This block is part of the South   
 Hams area in South Devon.It is almost 
 entirely made up of fields,bordered by
 high hedges and banks and laced with  
 tiny lanes (mostly single track) which
 wind up and down the steep hills and  
 around long-forgotten farm boundaries.
 The soil here is among the most       
 fertile in England.The  farms here are
 mostly mixed (cows,sheep and crops).  
 The main crops are barley,corn and    
 oats.Much of the population live in   
 fairly isolated farms scattered       
 throughout the block.The main         
 settlements are at Battisborough Cross
 and at Membland and Collaton Court,   
 these last two in the outskirts of    
 Noss Mayo.Many inhabitants are        
 connected with farming,but            
 increasingly "outsiders" are buying   
 property and commuting to work in     
 Plymouth.                             </content>
