Since 1976 when a Charter was signed   
by the Mayor of Liffre in France and   
the Chairman of Wendover Parish        
Council, an active twinning            
arrangement has developed between the  
two towns. Liffre is a small town,     
population 4000, in the Ile et Vilaine 
department of Brittany and the         
population of Wendover is 7,200.  The  
nearest city to Liffre is Rennes.      
The John Colet Secondary School went   
on an initial visit to the             
corresponding school in Liffre and     
since then links between the two       
communities have been developed        
between football matches, orchestra    
visits and regular school exchanges.   
At this point, in 1985 discussions are 
being suggested regarding a triangular 
arrangement with a town in Germany.
