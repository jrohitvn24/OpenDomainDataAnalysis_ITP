		<content> Our school is a Junior&amp;Infant Mixed.It
 is a small village school,with 5      
 teachers and a Headteacher.The        
 building is three years old having    
 been built because the old one was set
 on fire in 1980.The children mostly   
 come from Hunwick but some come       
 Toronto,5 come from Sunnybrow and 3   
 from Willington.At Christmas we have  
 parties ,a play and a Carol Concert.  
 In  Spring we sometimes have a Spring 
 Fayre and in summer we have a Sports  
 Day.We donate toys to Dr. Barnardo's  
 children every year.The children in   
 our school go to the theatre once a   
 year and we have other educational    
 visits,usually one a term.The eldest  
 pupils go on an annual field trip to  
 centres at Richmond (Yorkshire),      
 Beamish Hall (Co.Durham), Ireshopeburn
 (Weardale) or Middleton-in-Teesdale.
