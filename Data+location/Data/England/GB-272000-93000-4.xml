		<content> The village school at Hittisleigh     
 Cross which opened in 1877 with a roll
 of 87 closed in 1952 when the number  
 of pupils had fallen to 6. Today 10   
 primary school children, 5-11 years   
 old, go to Yeoford, Spreyton or       
 Cheriton Bishop schools. Free school  
 transport is provided by a mini-bus to
 Yeoford leaving Hittisleigh Cross at  
 8.30 am and returning at 3.45 pm; 12  
 older children are sent to Queen      
 Elizabeth Community College at        
 Crediton; transport is provided at    
 8.20 am and returns at 4.45 pm. A     
 choice of sixth-form colleges is      
 provided by Crediton,  Exeter and     
 Okehampton. Choice is not limited to  
 one particular school but transport   
 is. There are no playgroups in this   
 area  but 5 children under 5 go to    
 playgroups in Cheriton Bishop and     
 Yeoford.                              </content>
