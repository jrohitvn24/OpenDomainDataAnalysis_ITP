		<title>05NEWPORT HARBOUR</title>
		<content> In 1875 Newport Harbour was extended  
 at the expense of the railway         
 companies in return for a right of way
 across the harbour.                   
 In 1981 the main cargo services       
 between Newport and the mainland were 
 suspended, and at the present time the
 only cargo transported is fertilizer  
 which is brought in between Christmas 
 and March.                            
 Newport Harbour is under the          
 jurisdiction of Medina Borough Council
 and is under the control of the       
 Harbour Master whose authority        
 extends up the River Medina as far as 
 the Folly Yachting Centre and the     
 Cement Mills landing.                 
 The River Medina is tidal and at      
 spring tides affords only 9ft of      
 water. Only vessels of shallow draught
 can avail themselves of the           
 facilities.                           </content>
