		<content> Altitude 250 - 500 feet.  No village  
 or great houses.  Many hamlets, large 
 farmsteads and isolated cottages.     
 sparse population.  almost all farmed,
 either grass or field crops.  a few   
 old pastures with riggs.  Some sheep  
 and cattle.  Sprouting crops hard to  
 distiguish in November - cereals or   
 grass? many fields of a crop like     
 young cabbages, sometimes with grass  
 undersown.  typical field boundaries  
 are hedges, usually neat but gappy,   
 not layered.  Many small woods.  No   
 stone walls, but many stonebuilt      
 houses.  Note Longhorsley Moor in     
 square 1 and 5; continuous almost     
 impenetrable gorse with blackberries  
 and wet patches.  Presumably          
 uncultivated because of tenurek, not  
 because of soil.  Few services.       
 'garage with servicing' for heavy     
 commercials only.  Two main roads     </content>
