		<content>    The railway line which used to run 
 from Marple through{Poynton}to        
 Macclesfield has been taken up and a  
 new path laid down so that walkers,   
 cyclists and horse-riders can enjoy   
 it.As it is flat it is quite easy     
 walking and because it is gravelly you
 dont get muddy feet.  There are lots  
 of unusual flowers along the trail and
 you get a good view of parts of the   
{High Lane}area that are impossible to 
 see from the road.                    
 It is so quiet along there that it    
 is easy to forget that you are not    
 very far from the main road,  in the  
 distance the buildings of the nearby  
 towns can be seen.It is easy to get on
 to the trail from a variety of access 
 points all along the route.This is an 
 excellent use of an old railway line  
 and brings the country to the town.
