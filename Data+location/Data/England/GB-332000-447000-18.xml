		<title>183 BELLS OF KNOTT END</title>
		<content>  {St Bernard's Church}, Hackensall    
 Road, was built in 1922. It is lovely.
 It has stained glass windows of bright
 colours and beautiful pictures and    
 scenes from the bible. Opposite the   
 altar on one wall is a big tapestry   
 made of hessian and other materials.  
 It shows Jesus with a lamb in his     
 arms. The pews are in front of and at 
 both sides of the altar and there are 
 long windows looking out onto lawns   
 and trees. Beside the church is a     
 triangular grave where the last parish
 priest{Bernard Cochrane}was buried in 
 1984. On the wall above is a statue of
 Christ and above it is the Aramaic    
 word "Maranatha" meaning "The Lord is 
 near".On another wall are three silver
 bells, put there when Pope John Paul  
 visited England in 1982.The bells are 
 named{Mary Holland ,Pope John Paul}and
{ Barney}, Fr Bernard's dog that died. </content>
