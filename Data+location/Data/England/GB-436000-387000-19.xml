		<title>19EID-UL-FITR:Muslim Sheffield</title>
		<content>   On Wednesday 19th.June,1985 I woke  
 up really excited because it was Eid. 
{Eid-ul-Fitr}comes at the end of       
{Ramadan,}the fast which Muslims keep  
 for 30 days, between sunrise and      
 sunset.                               
   I rushed downstairs and Mum gave me 
 my new{shalwar kameez}(trousers and   
 tunic) and sandals which she had      
 brought me from Pakistan. My dad and  
 brother came back from the Mosque     
 where they had been since nine to read
 the{Koran,}our holy book.             
   They sat down and ate some coloured 
 rice, and then gave us some Eid money.
 We also sent some money to our family 
 in Pakistan so that they could have a 
 good time. Then we went around to see 
 our relatives to exchange gifts and   
 money with them too.
