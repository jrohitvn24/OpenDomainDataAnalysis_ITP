		<title>17Schools'trip to France.</title>
		<content> I went on a trip to France which      
 involved five different schools. Only 
 three children went from our school   
 and our teacher,Mrs. Farebrother.We   
 travelled on June 13th 1985 and left  
 Bothel School in a coach at 20.00     
 hours. There were thirty seven        
 children on the coach and five        
 teachers. We travelled down to Dover  
 through the night and boarded the     
 ferry to take us across the channel at
 about 6.00 hours. We were just about  
 an hour and a half on the ferry,which 
 was great as we could walk about and  
 buy food and drinks.Near to Calais on 
 the French coast,we went down to the  
 deck where the coach was parked and   
 got in our seats, ready to disembark. 
 We had a long journey through France  
 to Trouville,where we were staying.   
 The coach driver put the video on and 
 most of us fell asleep.               </content>
