		<content> The pupils at Jerry Clay Lane School  
 (class five only) would like to       
 welcome you to  The Domesday Project  
 1986 .These are some of the things we 
 have written about;THE NEW VILLAGE    
 HALL,GIRLS BRIGADE , THE NEW PILOTS   
 CLUB, GARDENERS WORLD, SILCOATES      
 SUMMER SCHOOL , THE BROWNIES, MAY DAY 
 SPECTACULAR, PROVINCIAL DAY, TV AND   
 MRS ELMY and lots more too.At Jerry   
 Clay Lane the areas that we are       
 covering,are Wrenthorpe and           
 Alverthorpe, Ossett and Wakefield.    
 Jerry Clay Lane School is nine years  
 old, but some other schools in the    
 area are a lot older. Pear Tree       
 Cottage is one of the oldest houses in
 the area (it is two hundred years old)
 and that too is in our project. The   
 pupils at Jerry Clay Lane have each   
 done their part in the Domesday       
 Project.                              </content>
