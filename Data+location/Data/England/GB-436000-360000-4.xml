		<content>{ Top Farm}is primarily a dairy farm   
 with the herd being kept a few miles  
 away. It was once four farms. It has  
 spring and winter wheat and barley as 
 its main crops.                       
{                                      
{ Woolley Farm}was built around 1860.  
 Its size is 44 acres.The land was     
 originally farmed as part of Stubben  
 Edge Estate. {Then}it was a mixed farm
 which grew corn (wheat, barley, oats) 
 and root crops (potatoes, swedes and  
 mangolds). The livestock was mainly   
 cows and calves with just a few pigs  
 and poultry.                          
{ Now}it is mainly a dairy farm. The   
 land is all down to grass but from    
 time to time odd fields are ploughed  
 up and re-seeded with new grass. At   
 present only dairy cows are kept along
 with young stock for replacement. The 
 herd of cattle is mainly friesian.    </content>
