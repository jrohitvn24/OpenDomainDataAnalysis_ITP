		<title>14A DAY AT MIDDLE SCHOOL</title>
		<content> It's 7.00a.m._my little brother Sam is
 standing on my head hitting me,       
 pulling and shaking me_a very hepful  
 alarm! I go down to find he's messed  
 the whole room up! Iwatch the news and
 sport whilst Mum gets breakfast. News 
 is normally about Lebanon, bombers or 
 hijackers. At 8.35 I leave for school 
 to play football till the whistle to  
 get into line. In school hang my coat 
 and go into class. Today we are doing 
 the{Domesday Project!}We get what we  
 need, line up to do the amenities     
 count in Bewbush and Gossops Green.   
 Then it's lunch and playtime, followed
 by lessons, play (2.10) and finally   
 storytime at 3.00 from my teacher. At 
 3.30 we stack chairs, collect bags,   
 walk home over the main road, then run
 to my house, change, have a drink, and
 play around "death tree". Tea is at 6,
 homework then play or bath and to bed.</content>
