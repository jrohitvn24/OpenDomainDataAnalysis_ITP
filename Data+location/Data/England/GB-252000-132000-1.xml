		<title>01GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF AREA</title>
		<content>{Sticklepath and Bickington}are        
 separated from{Barnstaple}by the Taw  
{estuary}and a long{hill.}They are     
 relatively intensely populated areas, 
 most housing being either side of A39.
 The open land is farmed up to the     
 estuary banks.There is also a small   
 wooded area.There are few places of   
 work and most residents drive into or 
 through the town across the{one bridge
 This leads to quite severe{traffic    
{problems}at peak times.It is a        
 dormitory area and house prices are   
 above average.Except for the immediate
 shopping,postal,cafe and pub amenities
 most people have to make the 2 mile   
 journey into the town.Though N.Devon's
{FE college}is here and at the foot of 
 the hill there is a small industrial- 
 shopping area which has a{hypermarket,
 a DIY store,the{railway station}and   
 N.Devon's only{Leisure Centre.        </content>
