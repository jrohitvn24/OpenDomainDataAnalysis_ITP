		<content> This part of Thornbury has seen a lot 
 of changes taking place in the last   
 twenty years.The changes relate to    
 the on-going need for more development
 in response to the growth of Bristol, 
 hence the large modern housing estates
 like Chiltern Park.As the population  
 has grown so to has the need for jobs.
 This demand has been met by the growth
 of the Industrial Estate.             
 In contrast to this there are areas   
 that have not been affected by these  
 changes for example,Milbury Heath.This
 is probably due to other geographical 
 factors such as the quarry at         
 Tytherington.
