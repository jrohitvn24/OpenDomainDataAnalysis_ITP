		<title>05Royal Observer Corp Post</title>
		<content>  When we visited the Royal Observer   
 Corp post close to the old Lewes Race 
 Course we had to go down a ladder     
 thirteen feet below ground.We were    
 surprised how big it was.Mr Holford,  
 who showed us around,told us that the 
 post was built of concrete and        
 measured 17 feet long, 7 feet wide and
 7 feet high.It also had a 4 feet      
 square toilet.It was built in l960.   
  The post could hold a crew of three  
 and there was enough food to last them
 63 man days.The food was in a box     
 and included lamb hot pot,chicken     
 roll,chocolate nutty bar and chewing  
 gum.This would enable the three man   
 crew to stay underground for fourteen 
 days.The post had its own petrol      
 electric generator and an air pump to 
 filter and exchange the air in the    
 post.                                 
  The Lewes post is connected by land- </content>
