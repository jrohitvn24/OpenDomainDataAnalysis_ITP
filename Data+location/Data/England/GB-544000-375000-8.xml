		<content> On our school field there is a heap of
 dusty soil that was brought here a    
 year ago from filling in holes. We    
 measured it and it took 17 children to
 go round it and it measured out to be 
{24m 43cm}in circumference. We found 15
 different sorts of flowers and 7      
 different sorts of grasses. There was 
 30% grass, 20% buttercup, 15%         
 wildmustard, 10% poppy, 5% thistle,   
 10% was bare and 10% included the     
 others. The most rare plants are{white
{campion and hedgegrow cranesbill.}We  
 took 6 samples of soil from different 
 parts of the heap and found in the dry
 dusty soil there were very few mini   
 beast except wireworm and red spider  
 mites. In the one sample from the     
 clayey side they were different,      
{8 earth worm and 6 leatherjackets.}We 
  also found ant, centipedes and       
 spiders.                              </content>
