		<content> Witheridge has a wide variety of      
 housing.There are a number of old     
 thatched cottages dating from over two
 hundred years and forming a           
 conservation area.There are a number  
 of victorian houses including a coach 
 house (now the Mitre Hotel).After the 
 second world war a large council      
 estate was built and then added to    
 this was a smaller estate of old      
 people's bungalows during the last    
 fifteen three new modern estates have 
 been built.Most of these are bungalows
 ,detached and semi-detached , and are 
 mainly occupied by elderly retired    
 people.These bungalows have sold very 
 easily because of their low cost but  
 there is a constant movement of people
 in and out of the estates.There have  
 been very few family houses built,just
 one row of terraced houses on one     
 estate.                               </content>
