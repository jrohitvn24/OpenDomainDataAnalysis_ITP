		<content>     The Offerton Estate is a large    
 housing estate built in the late      
 1960's. It was mainly built by        
 Stockport Council although some homes 
 are now owned by a Housing            
 Association.                          
     The houses are known as terraced  
 or town houses.They are built in      
 groups consisting of from 2 to 8      
 houses, all joined together. They are 
 mostly two storeys high but there are 
 some three.they are placed in         
 so-called neighbourhood blocks and    
 whilst they have a small rear garden  
 there is no front garden.Instead the  
 front doods open onto greens or       
 walkways,some of which are tree lined.
     Most houses are built to one of   
 four designs.The roofs are tiled,the  
 walls made of pre-formed concrete slbs
 with some brick.The occupants pay rent
 to Stockport Council.                 </content>
