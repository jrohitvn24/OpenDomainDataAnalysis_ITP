 We have three churches in the area all
 of which are in Buxted.St Mary's and  
 St Margaret the Queen are both Church 
 of England and the third is the       
 Methodist Church. Rev D.Rankin is     
 rector of the two C of E churches plus
 one other outside of our area Hadlow  
 Down. Combined junior church services 
 are held at the Methodist Hall. The   
 school has a good contact with St     
 Margaret's.                           
 Five children from the top class of 30
 attend St Mary's regularly,seven      
 attend St Margarets and ten don't go  
 to church at all except with the      
 school.                               
 I go to junior church every Sunday.   
 First of all we have a service then we
 go into age groups and play games and 
 read stories about Jesus afterwards we
 have a drink ,a biscuit and go.       </content>
