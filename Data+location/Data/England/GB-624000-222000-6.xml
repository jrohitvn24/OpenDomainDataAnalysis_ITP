 moment.10 acres of the site is water  
 and the other 10 is land.The marina is
 15 years old and Mr Titchmarsh has    
 always owned it.4 people work here    
 full time and between 2-20 work part  
 time.Mostly people from other places  
 use the marina,less than 30 locals    
 come.It takes a boat roughly 35       
 minutes to get out to sea from the    
 marina.Before it was a marina the area
 was all sea.The boat from furthest
