		<content>  There are only two places of worship 
 in our block, both of them next to    
 each other in Kingswood: the Anglican 
 Church and the Congregational Chapel. 
 Some people in Kingswood go to        
 churches and chapels in other villages
 and towns. Kingswood Church is quite a
 small building but it is bigger than  
 the chapel. Inside the church it is   
 neither hot nor cold, but it is cosy  
 and the atmosphere is friendly. The   
 chapel is quite warm and is also quite
 friendly.                             
  At both church and chapel, the       
 services go on for about an hour. The 
 leader of the church is called the    
 Rector. He is also the Vicar of       
 Hillesley, Tresham and Alderley. The  
 leader of the chapel is called the    
 Pastor. The pastor has been in        
 Kingswood for 14 years. Before that he
 was a gospel singer.                  </content>
