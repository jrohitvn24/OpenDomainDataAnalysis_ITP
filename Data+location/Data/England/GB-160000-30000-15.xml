		<title>15A DAY IN THE LIFE OF MATTHEW</title>
		<content> At about five it's time for tea.  We  
 don't have tinned food like most      
 people because we grow our own        
 vegetables and rear our own meat.  Mum
 feeds the animals now and I sometimes 
 help but if she doesn't need me I     
 watch television.  I like             
 action-packed films and cartoons.     
 I've written a letter to Dad tonight  
 and now I'm going to bed.  I get my   
 pyjamas on and get washed.  Then I go 
 to bed and read for half an hour.  I'm
 reading a book with lots of stories in
 and I'm enjoying them very much.  My  
 favourite one is "Car With No Brakes".
 It has lots of exciting description of
 a car going down a hill with no       
 brakes.  Mum comes up at eight and I  
 go to sleep.
