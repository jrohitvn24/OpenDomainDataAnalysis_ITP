		<content> Fishborne Car Ferry Terminal.         
   The car ferry runs between Fishborne
 and Portsmouth, with services every   
 hour.  It is one of three car ferry   
 routes operated in    1985 AD  with   
 British Ferries owning this route and 
 one other.  Bookings are made on a    
 computer and summer reservations have 
 to be made well in advance.           
 Average cost for a family of four with
 their car is around Â£30 return        
 depending on the size of the vehicle. 
 Two new ferries were used in 1983     
 capable of taking around 100 cars and 
 freight traffic, using a mezzanine    
 (lifting) deck.  Island residents are 
 given a discount to travel to the     
 mainland at the present time.
