 carnival Queen, Helen Ashley, opened  
 the Exhibition. She was accompanied by
 the Deputy Queen and Little Miss

 adults, 30p for children. Around 500  
 people attended, including exhibitors,
 who manned 20 stalls. Rail stock,     
 ships, cars, aircraft and other models
 were on display. An amateur radio     
 station contacted stations world wide.

 recruit members. Lace-making, hand-   
 spinning and broom-crochet, ribbon    
 flower-makers demonstrated their      
 skills. School children presented     
 their puppets and model houses.       </content>
