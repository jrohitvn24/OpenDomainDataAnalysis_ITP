		<content>In the North Hammersmith and College   
Park area there are fourteen schools.  
They are three secondary schools for   
children aged 11 to 18 years,          
Hammersmith, Burlington Danes and      
Cardinal and Sion Manning.             
There are ten primary schools for      
children aged from 5 to 11 years. Most 
of the schools are in the south and    
east parts of the area due to the      
concentration of people.               
The secondary schools have more pupils 
than the primary schools; about 1,000  
compared with 200.The teacher in the   
secondary school teaches only one or   
two subjects to nearly all the         
children.The primary school teacher    
teaches all subjects to the same group 
of chidren.The children are at school  
from 9am to about 4p.m. There is one   
college of Further Education for       
adults.                                </content>
