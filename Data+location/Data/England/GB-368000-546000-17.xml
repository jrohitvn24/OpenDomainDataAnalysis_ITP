		<title>17RECREATION ON ALSTON MOOR</title>
		<content> In Alston we don't have many spectator
 sports.We lack spectator facilities,  
 and sports clubs are unable to provide
 these because of limited funds.       
 The spectator sports are cricket,     
 golf, football, rugby and bowling.    
 Only the bowling club has seating     
 available.                            
 The winter indoor games are           
 badminton,bingo and whist.Badminton   
 and whist are in the winter only,while
 bingo is all the year round.Darts and 
 pool are played regularly in most     
 pubs.Chess and Bridge Clubs meet      
 twice a week in the Blue Bell Inn.    
 Most clubs are well supported and     
 matches are played against clubs in   
 neighbouring towns and villages.      
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
