		<content>  Two medical practices serve          
 Stillingfleet and Kelfield: one from  
 Ricall , the other from Escrick.      
 Prescriptions are dispensed at the    
 surgery or by a chemist in Selby or   
 York. In an emergency a drug can be   
 collected from the cottage hospital in
 Selby. There is a rota system of      
 volunteers in Stillingfleet to take   
 people to surgery or hospital         
 appointments.  District nurses and    
 health visitors visit as necessary.   
 A mobile chiropody unit visits        
 Stillingfleet once every three months.
 This is funded by the N.H.S. and run  
 by the Women Royal Voluntary Service. 
  Acaster Selby residents can call on  
 the services of Doctors and other     
 medical auxilliaries in Tadcaster and 
 Copmanthorpe(York).
