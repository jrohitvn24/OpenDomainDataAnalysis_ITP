		<title>11Le Pinacle</title>
		<content>   Neolithic people lived there 5000   
 years ago.The last event recorded was 
 probably the building of a Gallo-Roman
 temple .  The pinnacle itself         
 is a giant stone crag some 200 feet   
 tall.In Neolithic times, forested land
 stretched out below the site.You can  
 find remains from Neolithic, Bronze   
 and Iron age times.                   
     The people who lived there left   
 because there were many sand storms   
 and all the sand covered their        
 houses.                               
     The Pinnacle is a naturally eroded
 stone.It was probably used as a place 
 of worship. At the bottom of the      
 Pinnacle there is dolerite rock.As    
 Dolerite is softer than granite the   
 waves have made a little ledge where  
 the dolerite is and undercut the      
 cliffs.                               
                                       </content>
