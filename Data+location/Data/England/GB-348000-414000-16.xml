		<title>16Doctor Billington, Eccleston</title>
		<content>    One of the village doctors occupies
 a surgery opposite Eccleston County   
Primary School.He is the only doctor in
this practice,and has been there for 10
years.                                 
    Over 3000 patients are on his      
panel,and he sees about 50% of them    
each year.Every week about 10 people   
are referred to hospital.The doctor    
does not visit as many patients in     
their homes as he used to do because   
more have cars and can visit the       
surgery.About 50 visit him each day.A  
consultation takes an average 6        
minutes.The percentage of older        
patients is increasing.                
    The doctor reports that people are 
more health- conscious than they used  
to be.They know more about illnesses,  
treatments and how to live healthy     
lives.                                 
                                       </content>
