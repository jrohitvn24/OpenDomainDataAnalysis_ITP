 labourer in the town.In 1884 was      
 opened the Operetta House (now the    
 Savoy Theatre) which was part of the  
 new Town Hall buildings.No record of  
 local entertainment would be complete 
 without a tribute to Bert Graham and  
 Will Bentley who for forty years      
 produced their popular concerts.Among 
 famous artistes associated with       
 Clacton in their younger years were   
 Norman McKinnel, the actor manager;   
 Lionel Tertis, the violist; and       
 Stanley Holloway, the comedian.
