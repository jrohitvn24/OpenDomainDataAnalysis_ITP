Park Infants School was built about    
1907. There are about 120 children at  
the school. They celebrated their 75   
anniversary in 1983. The teachers there
are Mrs Croxon, Mrs Crawley, Mrs Wood, 
Mrs Bedborough and Mrs Morris, who     
is the headmistress. The children      
have to be there from 9.00am until     
12.00 noon, and they come back in the  
afternoon from 1.15pm until 3.15pm.    
During dinner-time the children are    
looked after by Mrs Aucott, Mrs Smith  
and Mrs Gubbins. When the children     
start at the School, they are only 4   
years old. They go for one week just   
in the morning and then the next week  
they go in the afternoon. The children 
at the school come from Raunds and     
Hargrave. The children have some       
"school" pets. They have some          
gerbils,fish and a frog.               </content>
