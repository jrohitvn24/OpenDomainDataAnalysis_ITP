 People dance through the main street  
 in the town with their school or      
 dancing classes. In the main street   
 there are lots of stalls. In a car    
 park they had lots of vintage cars on 
 show, some of them dating back before 
 the Second World War.                 
{RICHARD TREVITHICK}                   
 Outside our library there is a statue 
 of Richard Trevithick who invented the
 first locomotive  in 1803-4. It was   
 the first locomotive to haul a load on
 rails.                                
 Richard Trevithick was born in 1771   
 and died in 1833, so he was 62 when he
 died.Richard Trevithick was the first 
 person to invent steam locomotives.
