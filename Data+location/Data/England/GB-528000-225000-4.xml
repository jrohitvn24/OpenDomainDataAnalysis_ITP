		<content> A number of small business in Walkern 
 - a coach company, soft drinks        
 manufacturer dating from 1790 but now 
 in difficulties, metal works,         
 carpenter/joiner, concrete            
 manufacturer, builder, village store  
 etc.- provide some employment for     
 those from inside &amp; outside the area. 
 Other businesses operating from       
 Walkern - 3 public houses, butcher,   
 hairdresser, garage, motoring school &amp;
 a firm of architects - offer only very
 limited employment opportunities. The 
 farmers these days are highly         
 mechanised &amp; employ very little       
 labour. It is estimated that 78% of   
 the working population leave the area 
 every day, many to other parts of     
 Herts. (Stevenage, Hitchin, St.       
 Albans, Hertford) &amp; a significant     
 number commute to London from         
 Stevenage.                            </content>
