{Stubbers}is an outdoor pursuits       
 centre. I have been going to Stubbers 
 for five years. A lot has happened    
 since then. A new lake has been opened
 and the previous lake is being made   
 smaller. Most of the canoeist use the 
 larger lakes but the{canoeing}pond is 
 occasionally used for instruction.    
 It's great fun down at Stubbers       
 especially in the summer holidays when
 courses are being held. Plenty is     
 going on all the year round there is  
 never a dull moment.                  
     In my view the best actvity       
 available at Stubbers is{camping      
 althougth{sailing}comes a close       
 second. Camping over the weekend when 
 a lot of other people are camping as  
 well can be great fun especially after
 night fall.
