		<title>18Typical Day _Millbrook Pupil</title>
		<content> My alarm clock goes off at 6am. My    
 hand reaches up &amp; switches it off. I  
 fall asleep. At 7am my brother starts 
 yelling. When I've had my breakfast I 
 watch, "TV AM" then at 8am I get ready
 for school. At 8.20am my friend calls 
 for me. We arrive at 8.55am. When the 
 bell goes its chaos. Its worse than a 
 London traffic jam. First we have     
 assembly where the Headmaster tells us
 about all sorts of subjects, usually  
 birds. Then we have maths. We have a  
 break and then English. After this its
 lunch time. At l.20pm its finished.   
 Some of the things we do like drawing,
 I like, but things like drawing graphs
 are boring. We have another break &amp;   
 then, hooray, its hometime. I get home
 at 4.10pm and I ride my bike, do      
 homework and watch TV.
