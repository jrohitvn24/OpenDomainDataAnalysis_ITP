{Shoeing}process.The horse shoes are   
 made by the blacksmith prior to the   
 horse's visit.The old shoes are       
 removed,the hooves trimmed and        
 cleaned.Each new shoe is heated,      
 placed on the hoof to make a print    
 then removed for final moulding to    
 make a good fit.The shoe is then      
 nailed to the horse's hoof.The whole  
 process of shoeing a horse takes about
 one hour.
