		<content>  This is at the gate of{Bayham Abbey  
{Estate.} It is built of limestone,    
 beside a{massive gateway.}Limestone is
 an extremely old building material.   
 The stone is very soft: that is why   
 many people used it for building      
 houses. The house was there many years
 ago: an old man lived there and he    
 used to{open the gates for the horses 
 and carriages that were going to the  
 big house which was a mile up the     
 drive.  Every year estate workers came
 to receive a new{free pair of boots}at
 the Lodge.  It is a small house, so   
 the people that live there now are    
 putting an{extension}on the end.  When
 they were digging the ground up to    
 find if it was too soft they found an 
 old well which had a pump. They have  
 a skilled{stone-mason}to build the    
 extension because an ordinary builder 
 coudn't carve the limestone.          </content>
