 On a summer's afternoon the area      
around the bridges may be crowded with 
visitors. People swim and paddle in the
water by Navigation Bridge, or follow  
the public footpath along to Radcot    
Lock.                                  
 Narrowboat trips are available from   
May to October: the "Battersea" and    
"Vanguard" make scheduled trips but are
also available for private outings.    
 This is a very popular fishing        
location, season tickets at 5 pounds   
each are available to the many anglers 
who fish here all year round. One      
pound   day-permits  are available     
from the Swan Inn. All coloured maggots
have been banned from these waters     
since June 1984. Radcot Angling        
Club arranges matches and competitions.
Pike, Bream, Brown Trout, Carp and     
Chub are reputedly in good supply.     </content>
