		<title>04MORWELLHAM -VICTORIAN DRESS</title>
		<content>   The {Victorian Costumes}worn at {   
{Morwellham }are made there.They are   
 copies of real ones.They are made by a
 team of three ladies who work most    
 days to help with the costumes.They   
 work upstairs in the {Ship Inn}.We    
 went upstairs and they showed us some 
 real things such as ladies hats and a 
 parasol and copies they had made.     
     They make big top hats,dresses,   
 bonnets,umbrellas,waistcoats and big  
 coats.They buy the material and then  
 make the clothes.We saw aprons and the
 hoops for a crinoline dress.The       
 dresses have some pearls and are very 
 long.                                 
      They had to change some of the   
 ladies costumes because they could not
 work behind the shop counters with    
 crinolines on because the hoops kept  
 getting stuck.
