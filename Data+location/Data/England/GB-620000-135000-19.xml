		<title>19 FOLKESTONE: M.V.HENGIST</title>
		<content>   M.V.Hengist is one of three Sealink 
ships on the Folkestone-Boulogne       
service. The others are the Horsa and  
the Vortigern. The ships are named     
after the Saxon kings of the ancient   
kingdom of Kent.                       
   The Hengist weighs 4800 tons and is 
360 feet long. She has a passenger     
capacity of 1500 and vehicle space for 
210 cars or 22 large lorries.          
   The ship is powered by two diesel   
engines, each of which burns 500 litres
of fuel every hour. Hengist is capable 
of travelling at 18 knots, and the     
average cross-Channel journey time is  
an hour and a three-quarters. Since    
being in service it is estimated that  
the Hengist has made some 16000 Channel
crossings.                             
   During 1985 Sealink became Sealink  
British Ferries and the ship is painted
in the new colours of blue and white.  </content>
