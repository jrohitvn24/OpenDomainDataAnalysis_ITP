		<title>06SHOPPING IN SHREWSBURY.</title>
		<content>     We found that most people we      
 questioned went shopping in{Shrewsbury
 more than once a week, and the rest   
 roughly once a fortnight.The most     
 popular shops seem to be the          
 multi-purpose shops which sell a      
 variety of products e.g.{Marks and    
{Spencers.}There is no doubt,however,  
 that of the shops which sell only     
 one product there were more{clothes   
{shops}than any other.                 
      The majority of people we asked, 
 payed by cash,with few paying by      
 cheque. Only one person out of twenty 
 payed by credit card.                 
      A lot of people walked to town   
 with a few going by car. The bus      
 service to town is good but few people
 used it.{Shrewsbury}is generally      
 quite good for shopping with a wide   
 variety of retail outlets.
