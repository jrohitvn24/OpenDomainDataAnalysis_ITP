		<content>  LANDSCAPE - Brassington is an area of
 contrasts stretching from 750ft  above
 sea level to 1150ft.   It is an old   
 mining village sheltered to the north 
 and east by hills, to the west it is  
 more open with views over the         
 Staffordshire hills.   A substratum of
 limestone under lies the area and     
 charaterises the soil which is chiefly
 laid down in meadow and pasture.      
 Longcliffe to the north is the        
 southern edge of the Peak District    
 National Park.   Here  the fields are 
 divided into small plots surrounded by
 dry stone walls and very few trees.   
 To the south trees and hedges divide  
 the fields, thus making a marked      
 contrast between the two areas.   Some
 of the natural beauty is being        
 restored to the hills by the removal  
 and levelling of the heaps of waste   
 left from the old lead mines.         </content>
