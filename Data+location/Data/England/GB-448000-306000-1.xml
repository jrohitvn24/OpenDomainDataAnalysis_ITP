		<title>01THE RATBY AND GROBY AREA.</title>
		<content>   The area lies approximately 5 miles 
 WNW of Leicester.It is traversed by   
 two major,busy roads,the M1 which     
 sweeps diagonally SE-NW and the A50   
 which cuts across the NE corner       
 parallel to the M1.The landscape in   
 the eastern half is hilly due to the  
 underlying granite,whereas the western
 half is more undulating due to the    
 Keuper Marl.                          
   Small parts of two expanding        
 villages,Ratby and Groby are included 
 in the area and between them is the   
 254 acre Martinshaw Wood a favourite  
 haunt for naturalists and walkers.    
 Groby was once an important centre for
 granite quarrying but this has now    
 declined and now there are no working 
 quarries within the area of study.
