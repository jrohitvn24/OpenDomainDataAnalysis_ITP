		<title>09Holbeach Hurn area and work.</title>
		<content> Most of the people who live around    
 here are engaged in work to do with   
 the land.Some people have their own   
 smallholdings or nurseries,and others 
 go to work for one of the big local   
 farms.Very few people go out of the   
 immediate area to work.If they do it  
 is usually to Holbeach or             
 Spalding.Only one or two go           
 further.One goes to Stamford,one to   
 Peterborough and one is employed on   
 the oil rigs in the Arabian           
 Gulf.Worth's farm employs 200         
 people,Thompsons farm employs 50 and  
 Mark Tinsley's farm also employs about
 50.There is no public transport so    
 people are dependent on their own     
 cars or bicycles.H.C.C.Tinsley of     
 Holbeach St. Marks employ many people 
 in their packing sheds and provide    
 transport from the villages.Worth's   
 have a big potato packing shed.       </content>
