		<title>08PLAYTIME GAMES IN DETAIL</title>
		<content>1) BRITISH BULLDOG: The children line  
up on one side. The catcher calls out  
a name and that person runs across. If 
he is not caught, the others have to   
follow. Those caught join the catcher. 
6) TWENTY-TWENTY: A game of hide and   
seek.                                  
8) POLO: A child picks a subject (e.g. 
trees) and the others have to choose   
one kind each. The first child picks   
one and races against the child who    
has that kind. The winner says "Polo". 
12) GERMANS: In Germans you have to    
volley the ball into the goal without  
letting it go behind the goal.         
13) WORLD CUP: You have to score 1 or  
more goals and then you stand at the   
side until everybody gets through.     
15) WALL BALL: The children playing    
decide on the order of play. One       
person kicks the ball against a wall   
and the next tries to do the same.     </content>
