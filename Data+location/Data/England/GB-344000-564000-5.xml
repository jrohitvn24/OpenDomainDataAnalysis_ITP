		<content>      Most of the land in the area is  
 used for agricultural purposes.Very   
 little land is used to grow crops most
 of it being used to support cattle    
 both beef and dairy though the        
 majority of farms keep a few sheep    
 too.                                  
      Some farmers tend to specialize  
 and rear pedigree herds of cattle e.g.
 Skitby Farm has a herd of Limousin    
 Beef Cattle while Stoneflatts has a   
 herd of Friesian Dairy cows.          
      Some farms like Brownrigg are    
 truly mixed having a mixture of       
 animals including dairy and beef      
 cattle,sheep, poultry of various      
 breeds and horses.                    
      Those who do grow crops usually  
 grow winter feed for their own animals
 including hay, silage, barley,        
 potatoes and turnips.
