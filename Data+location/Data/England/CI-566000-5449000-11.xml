		<title>11POTATOE LIFTING</title>
		<content>   Primary land use in the St Saviour  
 area is the growing of potatoes. In   
 the first few months of the year every
 available piece of land is planted    
 with seed potatoes. 1985 was no       
 exception.                            
    Large polythene sheets were placed 
 over the crops to protect them from   
 frost. However, the the large         
 scale use of these sheets also caused 
 problems.                             
   Easterly winds blew the potato pest 
 (colorado beetles) from the French    
 mainland. Three live beetles were     
 found on beaches along with many dead 
 ones. If one had managed to get under 
 one of the sheets unnoticed, a colony 
 could have developed.                 
   A further problem lay with the humid
 weather. Damp air and warm            
 temperatures encouraged the           
 development of potato blight.         </content>
