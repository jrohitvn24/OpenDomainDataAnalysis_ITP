		<content> The East Norfolk 6th Form College     
 opened in September 1982 with 330     
 full time students. The college was   
 founded as part of the reorganisation 
 of schools in the Gt. Yarmouth area,  
 from a mixture of Grammar and         
 Secondary Modern schools to all       
 ability High Schools with a separate  
 6th form provision. The college is    
 housed in the buildings of the former 
 Alderman Leach school, and work       
 continued on its conversion for about 
 12 months after it was opened. The    
 college courses catered initially for 
 students seeking entry to higher      
 education and study for 'O' and 'A'   
 level examinations, but from September
 1985 a CPVE course has been offered.
