		<title>07A glimpse of Thurlow</title>
		<content> The visual impression is of           
 comfortable rural charm; every square 
 foot is cared for ; fields and        
 roadsides well tended and houses and  
 gardens immaculate. Little Thurlow's  
 church of St Peter dates mainly from  
 the 14th &amp; 15th centuries. Built of   
 flint and stone with its tower        
 decorated with chequer patterned      
 battlements, it features some unusual 
 'spiders web' windows above the       
 aisles. Otherwise the oldest buildings
 are the fine millow Elizabethan brick 
 almshouses and free school given to   
 the village in 1614. The smock mill   
 overlooking the village has outlived  
 11 of the 13 once visible from its    
 top; worked until 1937 it was restored
 by the estate owner in 1962 making a  
 fine landmark. Little Thurlow features
 a small triangular green, formerly an 
 animal pound, ad a shallow ford.      </content>
