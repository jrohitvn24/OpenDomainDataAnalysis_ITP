		<title>18WHEATHAMPSTEAD ECOLOGY</title>
		<content>  Two of  us did a survey about nature 
 and the local environment in the      
 Wheathampstead area.The people who    
 live locally thought that the river   
 and the Dyke should be cleared up     
 and farmer's should stop building     
 on the country side.Most people       
 thought that the council should clean 
 up the footpath around Wheathampstead.
 Most people liked the idea of putting 
 more bins around the play area's and  
 estate.People would also like to see  
 more trees planted around the area.We 
 asked if they've seen anything nature 
 wise,one man said that he'd had deer  
 in his garden since he'd moved into   
 his new house.We asked people do you  
 think there's enough river walks and  
 nearly all the people we asked said   
 yes.We asked do you think there should
 be more flower's around the estate and
 all the people we asked said yes.     </content>
