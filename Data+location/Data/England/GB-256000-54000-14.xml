		<title>14Lyneham Inn Plym.St.Mary.</title>
		<content>  This inn dates back to the 18th      
 century,when it was a small 'watering 
 hole' attached to a farmhouse.It has  
 been extended over the years,but it is
 now{a listed building.                
  It relied on the passing trade of the
 old A.38 and is completely isolated in
 somuch as its only neighbours are     
 the farms scattered about.When the    
 new A.38 was opened{trade fell off    
 almost completely.However the positive
 approach of the landlady paid         
 dividends.She turned the land behind  
 the pub into a{garden area with seats 
 and sun umbrellas.She installed a     
 large{play area for children,}and soon
 people noticed the change from the    
 road and{customers come from          
{Plymouth,Ivybridge}and the new housing
 development at{Plympton}to boost      
 trade.
