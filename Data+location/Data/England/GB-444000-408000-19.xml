		<title>19Our family during the strike</title>
		<content>  My dad is Administration Officer at  
{South Kirkby Colliery.}It changed in  
 our house during the strike not       
 because of money,for he got well      
 paid,but because we always watched the
 news.Usually we only watch B.B.C.1 but
 we watched all the channels.My dad    
 used to talk about the strike with my 
 mum all the time.I preferred to play  
 out with my friends all the time.The  
 strange thing was nobody hated my dad 
 because he went to work.{J.Lloyd}     
{Women's Action group During the strike
 There were two action groups one for  
 Kirkby men,the other for Frickley     
 men.Their action group had the        
 nickname Flag. They distributed food  
 parcels,vouchers and raised money by  
 organised raffles and jumble sales.   
 Some ladies ran a soup kitchen at the 
 Social Centre in South Elmsall.They   
 also organised marches.{B.Smith       </content>
