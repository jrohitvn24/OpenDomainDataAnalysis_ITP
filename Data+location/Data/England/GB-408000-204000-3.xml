		<title>03BIBURY AREA:FIELD BOUNDARIES</title>
		<content> The main field boundaries are Cotswold
 drystone walls or hedgerows.The stone 
 for the walls came originally from the
 small local quarries that are now no  
 longer in use.Some of the walls are in
 a poor state of repair because of the 
 time,costs and labour required for    
 rebuilding.                           
 The hedgerows contain mainly          
 hawthorn,elderberry,maple,ash and     
 blackthorn.Most of the hedgerows have 
 been layered in the past to make them 
 stockproof and some farmers in the    
 area still layer them regularly.Today 
 the hedgerows are kept tidy by winter 
 cutting by tractor driven hedge       
 cutters.                              
 The number of tree species in a 30    
 metre length of hedge gives an idea of
 the age of the hedgerow.Most of the   
 hedgerows studied in the area were    
 between 500-700 years old.            </content>
