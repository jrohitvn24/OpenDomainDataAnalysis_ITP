		<title>14Dartmouth Castle.</title>
		<content> We talked to the custodian,the Castle 
 is now run by English Heritage,which  
 is the Historic Buildings and         
 Monuments Commission. E.H. now        
 runs 126 national monuments,in '83,the
 castle was the 42nd most visited,in   
 '84,the 32nd.E.H.'s aim is to make the
 building more commercial,so that the  
 shop is raising more money from       
 customers.The site has examples of 600
 years of coastal defence and weapons  
 and possibly  there will soon         
 be a larger exhibition and more       
 explanations and labelling in the     
 Castle.The Castle Battery may also    
 become part of the public area.       
 The Castle staff's busiest months are 
 August,then July,September,June.They  
 work 9.30-18.30,and after that they   
 have to polish and dust the inside of 
 the castle and do the gardening.They  
 expect 35-40,000 visitors this year.  </content>
