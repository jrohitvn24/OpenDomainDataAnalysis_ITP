		<title>12Farming in Sheering.</title>
		<content> Most of the land around Sheering is   
 used for crops.We saw barley,broad    
 beans,wheat and rape growing.There    
 is also grass for hay.                
 However there is a{beef}farm.The      
 farmer here grows wheat and barley.The
 grain and straw are both used for     
 animal feed.To this he adds           
 minerals,salt and protein,the amount  
 of which depends on the size of the   
 animal.                               
 Friesian cattle are kept,because they 
 fatten quickly.The calves come at a   
 week old from another Essex farm and  
 are kept until they are about 14      
 months old.Then they are locally      
 slaughtered at Hatfield Heath.Most of 
 the meat is high quality and sold to  
 hotels and restaurants.There are also 
 four cats which catch the mice on the 
 farm.                                 
                                       </content>
