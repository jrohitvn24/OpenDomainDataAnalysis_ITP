		<title>01Pendomer and Halstock</title>
		<content> This block includes the hamlet of     
 Pendomer, in Somerset, and part of    
 Halstock which is in Dorset, although 
 its postal address is Somerset. The   
 county boundary crosses the block from
 east to west. The main Waterloo to    
 Penzance railway line runs across the 
 north-west corner of the block,       
 forming something of a barrier between
 Pendomer and the rest of the area.    
                                       
 Apart from the two villages,          
 settlement consists mainly of         
 scattered farms. Indeed, the          
 predominant land use is farming,      
 mostly dairy or mixed, though there is
 some forestry. A large portion of     
 Sutton Bingham reservoir occupies part
 of the eastern half of the block. Most
 of the roads run from north to south. 
 There is no industrial development of 
 any kind.                             </content>
