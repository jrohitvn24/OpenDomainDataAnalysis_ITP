		<title>18Cark Airfield</title>
		<content>    This old airfield has found a new  
 lease of life as a local centre for   
 two exciting,modern sports.           
   Part of the field is now the base   
 for a{Parachuting club}that offers    
 facilities for beginners,through to   
 the experienced sports parachutist.   
 The club also organises charity jumps 
 and these have proved a novel,exciting
 way of raising funds.                 
   At regular intervals throughout the 
 year the airfield is used for{Motor-  
{Cycle}racing.These events are very    
 popular, spectators and competitors   
 coming from near and far.             
   When these activities are not in    
 progress, quiet returns and all you   
 will find are grazing animals and     
 birds.
