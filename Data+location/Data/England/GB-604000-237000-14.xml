		<title>14RAYDON CRICKET CLUB</title>
		<content>During the 1930's the Raydon and Holton
St.Mary cricket club played their home 
games at Holton Hall.The club then     
moved to the King George 5th playing   
field at Raydon with only a few years  
break during the war.Games continued to
be played there until 1968 when support
was low and the club closed.In 1980 the
club was reformed and continued to play
at Raydon with approx. 35 games each   
season.The team travel as far as       
Mendlesham but also play local teams   
such as East Bergholt,Capel St.Mary and
Ardleigh.                              
The club has two trophies,one for the  
all round player who does most for the 
club on and off the field and another  
for the player who improves his game   
most during the season.                
Each year a game is played between the 
present team and those who played up to
1968 called the veterans.              </content>
