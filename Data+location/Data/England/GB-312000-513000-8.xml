		<content> Moss Dubs is a man made pond that was 
 constructed in 1982 to attract animals
 and bird life to the area.Carefully   
 concealed hides have been provided    
 from which it is hoped people will be 
 able to film and watch varied         
 species.In the pond are many fresh    
 water animals such as tadpoles,nymphs,
 back swimmers,black slug,water        
 bettles,may fly lavae and midge       
 lavae.There are rhododendrons growing 
 on the outskirts of the pond.It is    
 going to take several years before the
 bird  life establishes itself here.But
 Herons can often be seen along with   
 Mallard Ducks and Coots.
