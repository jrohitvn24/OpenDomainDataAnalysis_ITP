		<title>10SHEEP DOGS, COLD ASHTON.</title>
		<content>    On Sunday, Sept. 29th, 1985 a{sheep
{dog trial}was held at Oldfield Farm,  
 Marshfield with a view to establishing
 a regular form of{rural entertainment 
 and a continuity of skills involving  
 shepherding and working sheep dogs.   
   {Sheep}are freed 400 yards from the 
 shepherd and his dog. The dog is then 
 commanded to bring the sheep to his   
 master by the most direct route       
 through various gates and obstacles.  
 The drive is completed when the dog   
 and sheep reach the pen, the gate of  
 which is held open by the shepherd.   
 Once the dog has penned the sheep, the
 shepherd closes the gate.             
    The site was ideal for the event,  
 giving a good view to the 1.000       
{spectators.}Facilities were excellent,
 food and drink being available.       
 Marshfield W.I. had a stall with      
 garden produce and home baking        </content>
