		<content> Ribble Motor Company runs the Ormskirk
 bus service from it's Skelmersdale    
 depot. The main routes out of the town
 are to Wigan, South@ort, St. Helens,  
 Liverpool and Skelmersdale. The buses 
 cover over 3000 miles per day.        
   Mersey rail network runs trains to  
 Liverpool and the line to the north of
 Ormskirk runs to Preston. Both trains 
 and buses are busy on market days and 
 at the rush hours but other than at   
 these times, the services are poorly  
 utilised.                             
   The town centre is pedestrianised so
 that most of the buses and the cars   
 avoid the town centre itself.         
   In the old days, trains used to run 
 to Skelmersdale and St Helens and also
 directly to Southport but the lines   
 have now been removed. Similarly there
 were straight through trains to many  
 towns in northern Lancashire.         </content>
