		<title>19CHURCHES AND WORSHIP</title>
		<content> Many places of worship heve been built
 in the New Town since 1945 to provide 
 for the diverse needs of the new      
 communities in the neighbourhoods. We 
 found over 20 congregations. Pupils at
{Southgate West School}were asked, and 
 attended between them{St Mary's,      
 Southgate,{Holy Trinity,}Tilgate,{St  
{John's,}town centre,{St Andrew's,     
 Furnace Green,{St Peter's,}West Green 
 (all C of E), two{Baptist}Churches,{SS
{Francis/Anthony,}town centre (R.C.),  
 and the{Mormon}church, Southgate.     
{Sikhs}go to Langley Green or Three    
 Bridges.{Muslims}go to Broadfield.    
 Congregations vary from 50-70 at St   
 John's and St Peter's to 1000 at the  
 R.C. church, though 1600 attend St    
 John's at Christmas. Christian worship
 has a long history here as both{St    
{John's}and{St Margaret's}(Ifield) can 
 be traced back to the{C13th.          </content>
