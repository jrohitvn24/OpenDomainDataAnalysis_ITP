		<title>16WOOD PRESERVATION AYMESTREY</title>
		<content>    At{Beech-Croft}near Aymestrey is a 
{Tanalith}timber treatment plant,      
 installed in 1973 and supplying timber
 to all parts of Britain and also to   
 Australia. The method is known as the 
{Vacuum Pressure Impregnation System.  
   The outer bark is first removed and 
 the timber dried. It is then fed into 
 a steel cylinder 40' long and 4'6''   
 diameter and a vacuum pump used to    
 withdraw all air from the wood. A     
 solution of{copper chrome arsenate}is 
 then pumped in and a pressure of      
 180lbs per sq in applied until the    
 timber has absorbed 176.66 litres of  
 solution per cub metre.  The whole    
 process taking approximately 5 hours. 
   The solution can never be removed   
 from the wood and it gives a greatly  
 increased useful lifespan to timber   
 which will be used for indoor and     
 outdoor building.                     </content>
