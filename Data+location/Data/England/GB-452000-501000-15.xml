		<title>15THE WAINSTONES</title>
		<content> The great stone outcrops and pillars  
 at the Western end of Hasty Bank are  
 known as The Wainstones. They overlook
 Great Broughton, two miles to the     
 North and stand like sentries over    
 Garfitt Gap. Deeply fissured, they    
 provide a favourite training ground   
 for local climbers, being high enough 
 to need roped ascent  and difficult   
 enough to warrant the use of advanced 
 techniques. Throughout the year       
 parties of such enthusiasts arrive at 
 weekends with their hard hats and     
 coils of rope, wearing boots and      
 breeches. However it is not necessary 
 to go to these lengths to admire the  
 view from the stones as a footpath    
 makes its way between them to the top 
 of the main mass. The Wainstones give 
 their name to a hotel and restaurant  
 in the village below, and can be seen 
 by looking S along the High Street.   </content>
