		<title>08A BARNARD CASTLE BUILDER</title>
		<content> I started this trade in 1920 and have 
 been in Barnard Castle most of that   
 time.Five people work for me and as   
 well as erecting complete buildings,  
 we do extensions,alterations and      
 repairs.I cover an area of about 10   
 miles radius and have built six       
 housing estates in the last 30 years. 
 The Catholic Church in Middleton-in-  
 Teesdale,St Mary's RC School,are both 
 my work, but a house in Winston is the
 building I am most proud of. Houses   
 now have more prefabricated roofs,    
 insulation, central heating and double
 glazing. In my 65 years materials have
 not changed much equipment has,       
 following the introduction of electric
 tools and mechanical diggers. Prices  
 have changed a lot, a three bedroomed 
 semi which was Â£1200 twenty years ago 
 would now be Â£32000. Land which was   
 Â£2000 a plot is now about Â£10000.     </content>
