		<title>20Housing Survey</title>
		<content>Most of the houses had been built since
the Second World War. There are hardly 
any houses of the time before the First
World War. Between the wars the western
side of the village began to grow with 
many big houses having large gardens.  
Since the Second World War the owners  
of these houses have often sold half of
the garden as building land for a      
bungalow. Other new houses have mostly 
been built to the east of Sandwich Road
and along Archers Court Road. It was   
found that before there were pavements 
in Archers Court Road people used to   
cross a small bridge over a deep ditch 
to get to their houses.
