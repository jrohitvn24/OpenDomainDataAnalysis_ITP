     A sentinel guards our hilly       
 parishes.Farmborough Common rises     
 above our mainly rural landscape.     
     Beneath it,mellow stone hamlets   
 are scattered here and there,with     
 Farmborough and Timsbury (where our   
 school is,)being the major villages.  
     A network of roads ensures easy   
 reach of Bath and Bristol.However,    
 this 'Green Belt'area has only        
 minimal industry of its own, farming  
 being the main one.                   
     Most of our spoken information    
 came from the people of Timsbury.     
 However,we did manage to venture      
 along some distant lanes to complete  
 our investigations.                   
     Of course,our sentinel didn't     
 sound the alarm.He had seen it all    
 before..........   .
