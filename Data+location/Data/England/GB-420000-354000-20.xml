		<content> to the farm to play.  My Dad shouted  
 me to go and have my dinner, after    
 dinner I went to Julie's again and    
 Shaun was there, so all three of us   
 went in the silage and played in it.  
 Dad shouted me I went to hime and we  
 went home to Mark and Mum.  Dad and I 
 stayed at home. Mark was playing with 
 his tractor.  I made a drink for me,  
 Mum &amp; Dad.  We had tea, we had meat,  
 carrots, potatoes &amp; peas, it was nice.
 Then we had ice-cream &amp; jelly. Then   
 Mark &amp; I put our pyjamas on, we had a 
 wash and cleaned our teeth and then we
 went to bed and I said :-             
 'Good night,                          
  Sleep tight,                         
  Wake up bright,                      
  In the morning light'.               
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
