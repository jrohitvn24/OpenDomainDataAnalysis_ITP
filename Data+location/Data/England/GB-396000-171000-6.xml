		<title>06Demolition Harris's Calne.</title>
		<content> In 1770,Sarah Harris opened a         
 butcher's shop.Her descendants built  
 up the business, adding bacon curing  
 to their butchery and grocery         
 enterprises.Eventually the shops      
 became a factory.                     
   In 1962,it became part of the F.M.C.
 group.This huge pig meat processing   
 factory dominated Calne for many      
 years,and employed over 1,500 people. 
   In 1982,the Harris factory closed   
 down because it was uneconomical.The  
 demolition firm is pulling the factory
 down in stages.                       
    The huge demolition site is an     
 eyesore in the middle of Calne and    
 residents are looking forward to      
 seeing the plans for a new landscaped 
 development.
