		<title>13BATTLE - WASHINGTON</title>
		<content> After Harold's defeat, the English in 
 the north were not defeated and would 
 not obey William. Danish fleets sailed
 up the Rivers Tyne and Wear, the Scots
 marched to Gateshead, and the English 
 in Durham and Northumberland gathered 
 together on the Black Fell.This was in
 the year 1068. William marched north  
 with his army. The battle took place  
 on the Black Fell.The hardest fighting
 was on Shadon's Hill, Washington.     
 After a terrible conflict, William    
 won. The Danes sailed away in their   
 ships and the Scots fled home.Then the
 fierce Normans destroyed everything.  
 Villages were burnt, men, women and   
 children were killed. The land was    
 left desolate. There is nothing in the
 Domesday Book about Washington.When   
 the Bishop of Durham wrote the"Boldon 
 Buke"in 1183,he wrote about Washington
 because people lived there again.     </content>
