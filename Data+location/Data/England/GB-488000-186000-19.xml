		<title>19WOOBURN GREEN-VILLAGE GREEN</title>
		<content>A large grassy area surrounded by shops
and houses.It is focal point of village
activities,like fetes.An annual fair is
held in May.Many fine horse-chesnut    
trees surround the green and at one end
is a War Memorial for the World Wars.  
The Queen and Albert pub was once a    
work-house and the Red Cow was once a  
wash house.Forge Cottage,once a black- 
smiths,is 400 yrs old and has been in  
the same family since 1885.The Roast   
Inn,recently modernised,was once an    
Elizabethean Coaching Inn.Most local   
inhabitants do some shopping on the    
Green.Many of the shops have retained  
their individuality,with friendly shop-
keepers,such as Doug Young,who takes   
his paper boys on an outing,and will   
change a cheque for you.New shops round
the Green include a video hiring centre
and Off Licence and a betting shop.
