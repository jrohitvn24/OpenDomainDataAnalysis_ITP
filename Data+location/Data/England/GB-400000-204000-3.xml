		<content> Most children today  complain about   
 school dinners. School dinners are    
 becoming better planned with less     
 greasy and fattening things included  
 in the menu.                          
  There are more salads,more roast     
 meals and the variety is quite large. 
 Never the less most children would    
 prefer{fish and chips}every day! Most 
 children who have a packed lunch have 
 slices of meat or meat spreads in     
 their sandwiches, chocolate biscuits  
 and cheese crackers are very popular  
 and crisps are a must. People today   
 often buy meals ready cooked these    
 come from Chinese or Indian "take     
 away"or the more traditional English  
 fish and chip shops. Pre cooked meals 
 heated quickly in microwave ovens also
 save time and effort for the house    
 wife.
