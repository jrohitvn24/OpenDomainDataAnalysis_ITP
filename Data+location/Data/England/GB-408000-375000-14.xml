		<content>  When Paul gets home,he gets changed  
 and goes out to play.About half an    
 hour later Andrew comes in from       
 school.He also gets changed and goes  
 out to play.I start to make the tea   
 ready for when my husband comes in    
 from work at about five o'clock.After 
 tea I wash up and tidy up and get in  
 the washing.                          
  At quarter past seven,Paul has a     
 shower and gets ready for bed.He has a
 biscuit for supper,then goes to bed.  
 Andrew has a shower at half past eight
 and then has some supper.He is        
 normally in bed for nine o'clock.Then 
 my husband and I relax and watch      
 television until we go to bed at about
 half past eleven.
