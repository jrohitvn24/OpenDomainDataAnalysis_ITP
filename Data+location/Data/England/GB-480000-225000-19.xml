		<title>19A Schoolboy's Day</title>
		<content>   My mum has to feed the baby every 4 
hours.I do some work for my mum like   
washing up and making the baby's bed   
and bringing the baby's bed downstairs 
and I hoover.My sister looks after the 
baby as well.I like playing with the   
baby and I like playing out in the     
garden with my bike.I like playing in  
trees and making camps.You make camps  
out of wood and stones and leaves and  
grass and mud.When it is ready I crawl 
inside and it is big enough for 5      
people to get in.I let my friends in it
and then we make it better inside.We   
put down some carpet and bring boxes to
sit on.Then we get out and do something
else like playing on our bikes.When we 
want a rest we get inside the camp     
again.I have "Bigtrak" which obeys my  
commands.We play on the rec where there
are trees and swings and a slide.
