		<content> Wages in the mining Industry have     
 improved as the following figures     
 show:                                 
    1940 Â£3-7s-6d (Â£3.375) (6 day week)
    1968 Â£24.5             (5 day week)
    1984 Â£100                          
 All of these represent average pay    
 with overtime.                        
    The average family in Etherley in  
 1925 was seven children.  Now it is   
 less than half that figure. Television
 plays a big part in peoples lives, but
 there is a sense that discipline and  
 respect for authority has been lost.  
 Churches are less than half full on   
 a Sunday.                             
    Some buildings in Etherley date    
 back to 1864.  The first estate in    
 Etherley was at St. Cuthbert's Avenue 
 and Bankwell Drive was the first      
 private Estate.                       
                                       </content>
