		<content> In our area, which takes in roughly   
 half the village, there are 72 people 
 in employment including farmers wives 
 actively involved in their farms and  
 some women working part-time. Of these
 72, 40 are working locally, ie within 
 3m of their homes and nearly all 40 in
 farming apart from the pub landlord,  
 school secretary etc. There are 32    
 people who commute to work in a town  
 or city, mostly to Bromyard, Ledbury, 
 Leominster, Hereford or Worcester.    
 Of the 72 employed, 11 are working at 
 a job dependent on farming from       
 contractors doing hedge-trimming,     
 fencing, spraying etc.to people       
 working for firms making or servicing 
 farm equipment. Others are marketing  
 fruit and vegetables grown locally.   
 This does not take into account people
 mainly women,who work at seasonal jobs
 such as hoptying, and fruit picking.  </content>
