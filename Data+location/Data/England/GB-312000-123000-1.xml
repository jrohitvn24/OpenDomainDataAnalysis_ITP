		<title>01MILVERTON VILLAGE</title>
		<content>     MILVERTON IS QUITE PEACEFUL. THE  
 TREES RUSTLE. THE BIRDS SING. CHILDREN
 PLAY.                                 
                                       
     THE FIELDS IN MILVERTON ARE QUITE 
 HILLY. THE SOIL IS SOFT, AND WE HAVE  
 GOOD CROPS. THERE ARE LOTS OF APPLE   
 TREES, AND LOTS OF TREES TO CLIMB TOO.
                                       
     THE HOUSES ARE MOSTLY MADE OF     
 BRICK. THE VERY OLD HOUSES ARE MADE OF
 STONES. THE HOUSES THAT ARE MADE OF   
 STONES ARE DOWN LITTLE LANES OR AT THE
 BACK OF HOUSES.                       
                                       
     THERE ARE TWO PUBS IN MILVERTON,  
 THE GLOBE AND THE WHITE HART. THEY ARE
 VERY GRAND LOOKING THINGS. THE SHOPS  
 ARE SMALL, BUT SELL A LOT OF THINGS.  
 THERE ARE QUITE A FEW SHOPS. THE      
 CHURCH LIES AT THE TOP OF A HILL      
 OVERLOOKING THE VILLAGE.              </content>
