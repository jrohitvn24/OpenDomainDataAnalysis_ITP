		<content> The by-pass has been thought about for
 seven years. There have been campaigns
 against it, but in August 1984 the men
 of Tarmac Construction Company and the
 Biwater Group set to work on the      
 mammoth task in front of them.        
 Its route is Chapel-en-le-Frith to    
 Bridgemont and it should be completed 
 by 1986, if everything goes well.     
 A few months ago all you could see was
 fields. Now there's mud everywhere and
 machines digging through the rocks,   
 then trucks collecting the earth and  
 rocks and dumping them. At the end of 
 next year it will be extremely busy   
 and no-one will walk on it.           
   The pasture in the field by our     
 house was completely destroyed in the 
 space of three hours.Now the view from
 our house is just rows of pillars and 
 a huge mound of earth.{
