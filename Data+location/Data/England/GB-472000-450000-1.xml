		<title>01WILBERFOSS A CHANGING PLACE</title>
		<content>  Wilberfoss is a small but expanding  
 village situated about 8 miles east   
 of York on the A1079. Many new houses 
 have been built in the past 10 years  
 and this has changed the character of 
 the place considerably. Whilst there  
 are many people who have lived in     
 Wilberfoss for most of their lives,an 
 increasing number come to live here   
 for much shorter periods and move on  
 usually because of changes of         
 occupation.                           
      There are few amenities in the   
 village at present and most people    
 travel to York or Pocklington for     
 shopping, leisure and pleasure. Among 
 the younger people in the village     
 there is a feeling that more          
 facilities need to be provided nearer 
 at hand.  Travel can be too expensive.
 Life in the country can have          
 drawbacks!                            </content>
