    Born deaf,Deafness through loud    
 noise and Hard of hearing.The deaf    
 community in this area are mainly hard
 of hearing, as there are many old     
 people. There are facilities for deaf 
 children at St. Osmunds,so they can be
 with normal children and socialize    
 with them. Special teachers visit the 
 deaf and talk in hand language (for   
 deaf and blind),and sign language (for
 just deaf). The 62 club in Dorchester,
 get together with deaf youths.        
   There is a lip-reading centre in    
 Dorchester where there are            
 professional teachers. Most people in 
 this area who want to go to           
 residential centres go to Exeter.In   
 Weymouth there is social centre for   
 the adult deaf.
