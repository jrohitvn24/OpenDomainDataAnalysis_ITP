		<title>12My Family in Cold Ashby</title>
		<content>I live with my mum,who is divorced,my  
dad lives in Newcastle.My family live  
in Cold Ashby,that is my mum,Ivan-my   
brother and myself.I have brothers and 
sisters in Newcastle,They are Karen,   
Antony and Cathrine who is 2 years old.
Ivan and I see my dad about twice a    
year,which isn't very nice,sometimes he
phones up. My dad spends a lot on Ivan 
and I,last Christmas he bought Ivan a  
BMX bike, a tool kit and things for    
starting at the Comprehensive  School; 
and I got a bike as well as a type-    
writer.                                
We go to fun parks,but that isn't often
either.My dad works in a taxi firm that
he owns,which is why he doesn't see us 
very often.My mum works as a cleaner   
and we have just enough money to live  
on.
