		<title>09The Cross in Irthlingborough</title>
		<content>   At the cross roads in               
Irthlingborough, where the old A6      
meets the High Street, there is a      
traffic island.  In the middle of that 
island is "The Cross".  The cross      
stands on a tiered octagonal base      
which is 366 cms wide and the total    
height of the eight steps is 222       
cms.  The shaft of the cross itself    
measures nearly 4 metres high and      
stands on a large stone base.  The     
shaft is square shaped and decorated   
with nine carved balls on each edge.   
What ever decorated the top of the     
cross has long since disappeared.  The 
original purpose of the cross          
was something to do with measuring land
but no one really knows how or why it  
was built.  It is thought to have been 
built in the late 13th century, about  
1280, although there is no accurate    
record.                                </content>
