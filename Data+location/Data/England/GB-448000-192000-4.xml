		<title>04Farming In Oxfordshire.</title>
		<content>   We went to visit a{large farm}in our
 D-block, altogether it was 2000 acres 
 and was made up of 10 individual      
 farms. The farmer rotates three crops 
 on most of his land. They are wheat,  
 barley and grass. Rape has a bright   
 yellow flower. It is grown to clean   
 the soil and put nitrogen back into   
 it. Mixed farming is when the land is 
 used for different purposes. Mr.      
 Caudwell grows crops of wheat, barley,
 and potatoes and is thinking of       
 experimenting with bulbs and vines. He
 also keeps livestock - sheep,         
 chickens, turkeys and cattle. Mr.     
 Caudwell employs 13 men and 8 women.  
 He has got 25 vehicles taxed to drive.
 He also has 3 combine harvesters, the 
 most modern cost Â£62,000. Most of the 
 land on the farm is heavy Oxfordshire 
 clay with the exception of Warren farm
 where the soil is very sandy.         </content>
