		<title>09PRINCES DOCK DEVELOPMENT</title>
		<content> For many years this dock has been an  
 eyesore in the city centre.  Dirty,   
 smelly and very dangerous (it cost a  
 young boy his life last year) the dock
 has been seen as a waste of space for 
 a long time.                          
 Built in the 1820's it was called     
 Junction dock as it joined the Old    
 dock and the Humber dock.  It was     
 re-named at the same time as the Old  
 dock and became known as Princes dock 
 after the Prince Consort.             
 There is now a proposal to turn the   
 dock into a recreational complex.  The
 development will stand on stilts in   
 the dock.  It will be made of glass   
 and chrome and has a maritime feel to 
 it.  It will contain modern shops, a  
 high quality restaurant, snooker hall,
 dance studio and a Disco/nightclub.   
 Outside the dock itself will be       
 cleaned out and used for boating.     </content>
