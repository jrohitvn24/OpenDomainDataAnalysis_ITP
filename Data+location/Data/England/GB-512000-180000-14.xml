		<content>     Alongside the canal there are many
 large firms such as Wimpey and Taylor 
 Woodrow who are civil engineers. In a 
 side street off Lady Margaret Road    
 there is a small complex of factories.
 The oldest building has been there for
 some 60 years, but the oldest firm has
 been there only some 40 years, and the
 youngest only a few weeks before      
 writing this.There is a wide spread of
 products.                             
       These factories have at most    
 some 20 people working there.Most     
 people have been with their firm for  
 about 5 years. The firms manufacture  
 or process microwave components,      
 binding and collating machines, salt, 
 dry ice, salt tablets, water          
 softeners, printing, burglar alarms,  
 stereo record players, plastic        
 mouldings, sheet metal work, cosmetics
 and oil blending.                     </content>
