		<title>10THE RIVER BLACKWATER</title>
		<content>   The River Blackwater is one of the  
 liveliest places in Maldon.Many people
 just visit Maldon because of the bar- 
 ges.They are one of Maldon's famous   
 sights.The barges were used for carry-
 ing cargoes like wheat,leather,oats,  
 salt and timber but today are used    
 mainly for pleasure.In the Summer they
 have barge races.The barges have flat 
 bottoms so that they can go in shallow
 water.Their sails are made from flax. 
 Flax is a creamy colour but they are  
 dyed brown with a mixture of ochre and
 oil.There is still a firm of sailmkers
 in the town.The firm has been there   
 for almost a hundred years and they   
 still use old fashioned ways of work- 
 ing.They make sails for barges and    
 also for yachts.They also carry out   
 repairs.
