		<content> This area has a large proportion of   
shops as well as large department      
stores.The town centre has a wide      
variety of shops to cater for          
everything.On the business side,there  
are a lot of offices.There is a wide   
range of bus and rail services.There is
also many miles of canals.             
 Leaving the centre you find that there
are still many buildings.Not all of    
these are shops and offices-houses and 
flats of all types.There are a mixture 
of ages on the houses,some modern while
others built around the time of 1945.  
There are parks,recreation and sports  
grounds around the area.We also have   
the Edgbaston reservoir which is a     
popular place.Entertainment is no      
problem as  there are theatres,cinemas 
and discos.There is also a wide range  
of hotels in which to stay.
