		<title>19CORNISH HEDGES</title>
		<content> Cornish hedges surround many fields.  
 They are made of granite stones with  
 earth in between and turf on top.     
 Ferns and flowering plants quickly    
 transform the hedge into a bank. On   
 the windward side there are mainly    
 gorses and lichens, but the sheltered 
 side is full of colour with primroses 
 in April, Red Campion in May and June,
 and Foxglovs in July. Other prominent 
 flowers include Cow Parsley, Blue     
 Bells, Celandines and Herb Robert.    
 Hawthorn, Hazel and holly are the     
 commonest shrubs in the hedges.       
                                       
 Animals thrive in the shelter of the  
 hedge. Butterflies and bees rest and  
 feed on flowers, while digger wasps   
 make nests in the earth. Other        
 residents include pigmy shrews, bank  
 voles, and wood mice, all food for    
 local barn owls and buzzards.         </content>
