		<title>03PLANT LIFE.</title>
		<content> This is an area of interesting plant  
 life.It is the southern limit of      
 northern plants &amp; the northern limit  
 of southern plants &amp; so plants from   
 the two areas overlap.Many conifers   
 have been planted around the          
 reservoirs.There are some decidous    
 trees such as oak,ash,sycamore,silver 
 birch,chestnut &amp; willow.On the moors  
 apart from the bracken &amp; heather,gorse
 can be found &amp; bilberries grow.These  
 are picked by many people to make     
 puddings &amp; pies.Many wild flowers     
 still grow here_foxgloves,campion,    
 tormentil,coltsfoot,wood anemonies,   
 vetch,violets &amp; wild pansies.In the   
 wetter areas of bog there are         
 primitive plants studied by leading   
 biologists.The stone walls are covered
 with colonies of various lichen.
