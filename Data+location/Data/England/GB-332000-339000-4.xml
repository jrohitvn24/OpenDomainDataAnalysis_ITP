		<title>04A Family Sunday, Sodylt</title>
		<content> In this family there are three people.
 The father works on his farm and his  
 youngest son helps him. He gets up at 
 7.00 am and milks the cows and sees to
 his other animals. The mother gets up 
 at 9.00 am and gets breakfast for     
 herself, her husband and their son. At
 9.45 am Mrs Parry goes to Ellesmere   
 Hospital to play the organ for the    
 elderly. At 11.00 am she gets home and
 gets a proper Sunday dinner for the   
 family. Most Sundays some of the other
 members of the family come to dinner  
 and also the son's girl friend.       
 They stay in all afternoon, or they   
 might go out for a drink, or go horse 
 riding.                               
 Milking time is at 4.00 pm.The family 
 might go home or stay for tea, when   
 the farmer comes in around 6.00 pm.   
 In the evening the parents watch the  
 TV.                                   </content>
