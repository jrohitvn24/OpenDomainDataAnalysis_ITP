		<title>10GAMES WE PLAY - NEW BRIGHTON</title>
		<content> "In the playground I play 'British    
 Bulldog'. This is how you play. One   
 person is 'on' and stands in the      
 middle of the playground. He picks    
 someone else by shouting their name   
 and that person has to run from one   
 side of the playground to the other   
 without being caught. If you are      
 caught you must stand in the middle   
 and become a catcher." {Howard        
{Haggerty(10)}                         
 "At playtime I play 'Flooretta'. The  
 rules of the game are that someone is 
 'on' and they say something like      
 "Floor jelly-wobbles" or "Floor       
 fire-engine" to the others in the     
 game. If they say, "Floor             
 jelly-wobbles" you have to do a       
 handstand and wobble your legs.       
 Whoever stays up the longest becomes  
 the person who is 'on'."{Edith
