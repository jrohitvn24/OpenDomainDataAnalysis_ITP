		<content>  Predominantly a rural area, the      
 farmland consists of small to medium  
 sized fields enclosed mainly by dry   
 stone walls and hedges (few fences).  
 A comprehensive network of foot and   
 bridle paths is still in existence and
 well-used. Local industries include   
 textiles, now in decline with many of 
 the mill premises lying idle or taken 
 over by small (often service-based)   
 firms, and pipe manufacturers, raw    
 materials for these coming from local 
 clay and shale quarries. Residential  
 areas are expanding quite rapidly with
 the influx of middle management (in   
 particular) who have easy access to   
 all parts of the UK, but particularly 
 Leeds, Manchester and Sheffield, using
 the motorway system. Long-standing    
 local families tend to have a strong  
 Methodist tradition and a desire to   
 live and work close to their roots.   </content>
