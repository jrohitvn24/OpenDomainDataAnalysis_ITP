		<content>  We have a local policeman who is     
 based at Hedon and he usually drives  
 around the area in his police car.He  
 will sometimes walk around and he     
 knows most of the families and the    
 children.                             
  The parish council are responsible   
 for most of the general order of      
 things such as roads and drains and   
 street lights. The roads are nearly   
 always in a mess because of the       
 flooding and the heavy lorries and    
 farm vehicles that use them.          
  The parish council are responsible to
 Skirlaugh County Council for making   
 sure that things run smoothly.At the  
 moment a new tidal barrier is being   
 built due to the council and street   
 lights were put up last year.         
  Most of the vandalism is caused by   
 children coming to the area from Hull 
 or Hedon or Thorngumbald.             </content>
