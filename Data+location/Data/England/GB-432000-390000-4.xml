		<content> To-day is Thursday. David, who is a   
 bus driver gets up around 5.15am. We  
 are up for 8am breakfast and go to the
 school for 8.55am. I catch the bus to 
 Hillsborough Shopping Centre where I  
 buy all the groceries we need for the 
 week at the supermarket.              
                                       
 David usually comes home for lunch.   
 This is our main meal of the day which
 we share together. After lunch the    
 children go back to school and David  
 to work. Ben, Laura and I are the only
 ones for tea as David does not arrive 
 home until 7pm. We normally settle    
 down in the evenings to do our own    
 hobbies. Ben has his train layout,    
 David his railway books, Laura reads, 
 plays with her toys or watches TV. I  
 knit, sew, read or watch TV.
