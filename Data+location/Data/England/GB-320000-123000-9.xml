		<title>09TRANSPORT-SILK MILLS SIG BOX</title>
		<content>  Part of the London-Penzance Railway  
 is in our area and it crosses the Silk
 Mills Road which is a fairly major    
 road leading out of Taunton.          
  There there are automatic barriers   
 controlled by the signalman who is in 
 the signal box beside the track.This  
 signal box,due to cuts by British     
 Rail,is soon to be one of many signal 
 boxes which are to be demolished,and  
 this stretch of line is to be         
 controlled by a signal box at Exeter, 
 further down the line.                
  Trains come down this line about 70  
 times a day,and they are mostly       
 passenger trains.The engines are      
 usually HST's (High Speed Trains)     
 although we do see diesels pulling    
 goods trains.
