		<content> The focal point of the village is St. 
 Andrew's Church,which dates from      
 Norman times.There are many interest- 
 ing architectural features of Gothic  
 styles,since the church was largely   
 rebuilt in this period.Recently,medi- 
 eval wall paintings were discovered &amp; 
 restored as much as possible using    
 sand,lime and original basic colours. 
 Over the Tudor North Porch is a       
 Priest's room where,it is suggested,  
 that the Gunpowder Plot was hatched in
 1604/05,as Sir Everard Digby,who was  
 hanged for treason in 1606,occupied   
 the Manor at this time.In the small   
 churchyard are examples of holly,yew, 
 ash,beech,sycamore &amp; elder trees.Many 
 of the old tombstones are of limestone
 There is no electricity in the church 
 and evening services are by candle-   
 light.The organ is pumped by hand and 
 there is one bell.                    </content>
