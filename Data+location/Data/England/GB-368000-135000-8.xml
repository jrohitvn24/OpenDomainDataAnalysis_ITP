		<content> The farmer we interviewed works long  
 hours on his farm,at least ten a      
 day,with a holiday of one week per    
 year.He enjoys his work and has been a
 farmer for twelve years.              
         His farm covers 100acres with 
 a further 145acres of rented land.It's
 at least 700 years old.Cows,sheep and 
 beef cattle are kept on the farm.     
         He told us that there have    
 been many changes in farming over the 
 last twenty years.With the help of    
 modern machinery a lot of the work is 
 much easier than before,in some ways  
 farming has become more like industry.
