		<content> This block lies to the south-east     
 of Lincoln and straddles the river    
 Witham. The Witham is historically a  
 natural boundary between the parts of 
 Lincolnshire,in this case Kesteven and
 Lindsey. Even today the river is a    
 major barrier the only crossing points
 for vehicular traffic being at        
 Lincoln and Bardney. We were lucky    
 in that there is a footbridge across  
 the River at 058,716 this enable      
 groups to gain access to the far      
 bank without  prohibitive  travel     
 costs. Little use is made of this     
 route by the general public  since    
 the closure and removal of the railway
 to Bardney. The river has been an     
 important routeway since Roman times  
 and recently featured in the B.B.C.   
 Programme "The Grain Run". Today its  
 use is limited to pleasure craft.
