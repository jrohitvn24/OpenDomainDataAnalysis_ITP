The population consists of a mixture of
professional people and Estate workers.
It is the families of Estate workers   
who are the true 'locals'. During the  
day the village is almost deserted, as 
those who work are either in the nearby
towns or are at work on the Manor      
farms. The children go to schools in   
Thrapston or Oundle. There are a few   
elderly people at home during the day. 
   The Mothers'Union is the only group 
meeting on a regular basis in the      
village. Most other activities being   
persued in nearby towns. Gardening     
seems to be the most popular pastime.  
Most gardens have a vegetable plot.
