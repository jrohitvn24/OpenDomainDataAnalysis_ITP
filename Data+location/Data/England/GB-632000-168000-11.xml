		<title>11WAR DECLARED ON SHOPLIFTERS</title>
		<content>          PEOPLE IN THANET AREA HAVE   
BEEN VERY ANNOYED ABOUT THE WAY        
SHOPLIFTERS ARE COSTING THEM A SMALL   
FORTUNE TO REPLACE STOLEN GOODS.       
THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE PRESIDENT SAID 
"IF I HAD MY WAY THE HANDS OF EVERY    
SHOPLIFTER WOULD BE CUT OFF".          
             THE SHOP OWNERS ALSO FEAR 
THAT SHOPLIFTING WILL INCREASE AS THE  
SUMMER DRAWS NEARER. MARGATE CHAMBER OF
COMMERCE THINKS THAT THE MAIN PROBLEM  
OF SHOPLIFTING IS THE AMOUNT OF        
UNEMPLOYMENT.PEOPLE WHO SEE SOMETHING  
THEY WANT AND CANNOT AFFORD IT TAKE    
THE EASY WAY OUT AND STEAL IT. THE     
POLICE BELIEVE THAT THE PUBLIC SHOULD  
ALWAYS  INFORM SOMEONE IF THEY SEE     
ANYTHING SUSPICIOUS.                   
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
