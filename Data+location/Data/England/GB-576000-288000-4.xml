		<title>04WEETING VILLAGE  3</title>
		<content> The only church is C of E and built   
 of flint with a round tower in typical
 Norfolk style but is mostly Victorian.
 Close by are the ruins of Weeting     
 Castle in its square moat. It is note-
 worthy for its icehouse in a mound in 
 the N.W. corner. Another local        
 historic site is Pepper Hill, a round 
 tumulus alongside the bit of Drove    
 Road known as Pepper Lane.Adjacent to 
 this the fields are unusually dipped  
 and according to local people this    
 was the area for digging clay for     
 brickmaking at the start of this      
 century.   In the village opposite the
 green is an attractive row of thatched
 cottages which are reputed to be the  
 oldest inhabited in the country.
