		<content> There have been in the past scattered 
 shops,at Meopham Green,Red Street and 
 Luddesdown,but these have closed      
 down."Ye Little Shoppe"is open all    
 hours near Sole Street Station.It     
 stocks a wide range of goods but has  
 little trade.There is  further trade  
 at the three petrol stations and the  
 many public houses.                   
 There are two groups of shops,one     
 consists of five older properties,near
 the station.There is an estate        
 agency,an off license,a small busy    
 grocers and a baker who bakes and     
 delivers his own bread.               
 The second group is larger and more   
 modern.
