		<content> Several businesses are based in       
 Stanhoe apart from the basic one of   
 agriculture.  'The Granary', a haulage
 firm of long-standing which is now    
 coupled with a garden centre, supplies
 animal feed and is involved in        
 carrying vegetables for local         
 producers to distant markets.  The    
 only other public trading is from the 
 village Post Office and General       
 Stores.  Goods are supplied to many   
 folk in the village in spite of a new 
 Superstore ten miles away which has   
 taken many customers.  The building   
 trade is represented by one builder   
 employing several workmen and is      
 currently erecting houses in Stanhoe  
 and other nearby places.  The Crown   
 Public House is open for drinking     
 only.  At 'Petergate Carriages' a     
 carpenter now specialises in the      
 building and repair of carriages.     </content>
