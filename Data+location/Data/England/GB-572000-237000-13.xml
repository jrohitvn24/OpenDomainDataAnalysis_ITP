		<content> The Parish Churches of St.Peter &amp; St. 
 Thomas, Stambourne and St. Margaret of
 Antioch, Toppesfield are both served  
 by the Rev.Jessup, who lives in the   
 new Toppesfield Rectory. Toppesfield  
 Church dates from the 14th century and
 is built of flint rubble and plaster. 
 The brick tower was built in 1699     
 after the original tower collapsed.   
 There is a musicians' gallery at the  
 west end. Stambourne Church, which is 
 also mainly flint, dates from about   
 1100, although it was largely rebuilt 
 in the 16th century. The ancient med- 
 ieval window is in a dangerous condit-
 ion and Â£15000 is needed to carry out 
 urgent repairs.Normal congregations at
 each Church average 20_25 but monthly 
 family services are being introduced  
 which it is hoped will encourage more 
 people to attend.Both Churches now    
 have a Sunday School and also a choir.</content>
