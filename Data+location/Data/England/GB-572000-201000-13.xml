		<title>13CHELMSFORD NURSING HOME</title>
		<content>   The house has been a nursing home   
 for three years. Originally it was a  
 home for naughty girls. The oldest    
 person there is 96 and she enjoys     
 reading. The youngest is 66 and he is 
 bed-ridden. Most of the people are    
 disabled and some have to use electric
 wheelchairs. There is a special chair 
 lift, to help the old people up and   
 down the stairs. They have a bath     
 which has a whirl pool action. There  
 is a lady who comes in at the weekends
 to help them knit and make pictures   
 etc.                                  
   There is a full-time staff of 6 and 
 about 30 part-time staff. The old     
 people are allowed to choose their    
 breakfast and tea, but they have a set
 meal for lunch.                       
   The house is very attractive with   
 flowers and pot plants in all the     
 rooms and each bedroom has its own T.V</content>
