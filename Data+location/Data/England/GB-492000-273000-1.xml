		<title>01The Addingtons, Northants.</title>
		<content>Great Addington is situated in the     
valley of the River Nene, approximately
6 miles S.E. of Kettering in           
Northamptonshire. Little Addington is 1
mile south of Great Addington. Both    
villages, which are mentioned in the   
Domesday Book of 1086,are surrounded by
farmland devoted mainly to crop        
growing.                               
The population now consists chiefly of 
professional people who travel away to 
work. Virtually no farm labourers live 
here now compared with 50 years ago.   
Few people wish to retire to live in   
the villages because of the lack of    
services.                              
The information on the following pages 
will say something about the buildings,
the people, the employment and the     
concerns of the local inhabitants in   
1985.
