		<title>13TALKING ABOUT GIRLS' BRIGADE</title>
		<content> We went to Saxon Street Methodist     
 Church and talked to Mrs Jaggard,     
 Captain of Saxon Street Girls'        
 Brigade. She said she had been at     
 Girls' Brigade for 37 years, and was  
 there as one of the juniors when the  
 Company was started.                  
 To earn a badge, they have to do      
 something physical, meaning sports and
 things like that;something educational
 meaning learning about something, and 
 something spiritual, meaning learning 
 about God. Cubs, Brownies and other   
 groups do not always learn about the  
 bible.                                
 Girls' Brigade is held on a Wednesday.
 The Explorers, aged 5 to 8 years,     
 start at 5.15pm and go on until       
 6.30pm. The Junior group from 8 to 11 
 years, starts at 6.30pm until 7.45pm, 
 and the Senior group starts at 7.45   
 until 9.15. Seniors start at 11 years.</content>
