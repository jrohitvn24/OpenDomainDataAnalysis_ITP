		<title>11Cockfield Fell.</title>
		<content> Cockfield Fell has an area of 820     
 acres.It is hilly,rough ground and    
 dates back thousands of years,before  
 the village in fact.It was probably   
 because of The Fell that Cockfield was
 built in the first place.Coal was     
 taken off The Fell in 1375.When people
 stopped moving coal from The Fell they
 left large piles of coal waste which a
 firm is are now trying to             
 reclaim.There is an old quarry on The 
 Fell where whinstone used to be       
 extracted.The houses on The Fell were 
 originally built for the quarrymen.The
 quarry is now being filled up as it   
 is dangerous.                         
  There is still evidence of the       
 disused railway,part of the Barnard   
 Castle to Bishop Auckland line which  
 used to run across The Fell.The Fell  
 contains relics of many ages,but also 
 has awide present usage.              </content>
