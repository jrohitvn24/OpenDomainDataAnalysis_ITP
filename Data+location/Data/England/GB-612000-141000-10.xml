 sheep. He has 400 ewes and 10 rams. He
 also has this years lambs and last    
 years lambs which are called tegs.    
 Half his ewes are Kent or Romney      
 Marsh. Kent sheep have good quality   
 fleeces. The other half of his flock  
 are mules. Mules are a cross between  
 Border Leicester and Swaledale. Border
 Leicester shep are prolific and have  
 lots of lambs. Swaledale sheep are    
 hardy. The rams are Hampshire Down    
 because that breed fatten quickly. The
 sheep mostly eat grass, hay and       
 concentrates.
