		<content>Children in both Hackleton and Denton  
attend their village primary schools   
until the year in which they are 11.   
The schools are designated County      
Primary. In 1982 Denton had a new      
school built as the original building  
in the village centre was too small.   
Hackleton has an extension to its      
original building.Both schools have    
mobile classrooms.                     
After the age of 11 the pupils are     
taken by bus each day to the local     
Comprehensive school.Denton children   
attend Wollaston school,near           
Wellingborough while those from        
Hackleton go to Roade.In both cases    
the  children travel about 7 miles in  
each direction.At 16 they are able to  
take either C.S.E.or G.C.E.O level     
examinations or a combination of both  
while at 18 they are able to take      
A level of the G.C.E.                  </content>
