		<content>   The original church on this site was
 probably {built around the year 633.}A
 complete  list  of  Vicars of Bradford
 starts in 1293.                       
   The  {present   building  was  built
{around 1408} and  the  tower was added
 around 1500. In about 1666 a clock was
 placed in the  tower  and this was the
{first public clock in Bradford.}      
                                       
   There  are  some  beautiful {stained
{glass windows.}The tower is  30 metres
 high.  Around the Cathedral there is a
 big  garden  instead  of  a graveyard.
 People are no longer buried there.    
   Each  year  about  20  weddings  and
 funerals take place there.    Services
 are held  every day.   Bells  ring out
 before each service.  Each  week   the
 bellringers practise.   The  Cathedral
 also   has    20  choir  boys  and  an
 orchestra.                            </content>
