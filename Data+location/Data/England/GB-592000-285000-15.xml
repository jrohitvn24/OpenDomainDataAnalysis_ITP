		<title>15Gravel Battle, Bridgham</title>
		<content> There was almost total support for    
 Bridgham Parish Council's fight       
 against the gravel extraction planning
 application (see page 13).  A strong  
 campaign of objection was mounted in  
 the local press and the issue also    
 featured in two Radio Norfolk         
 programmes.  District and County      
 Planning Committee members, regional  
 environmental groups, etc. were all   
 lobbied for their support.            
                                       
 The extraction proposal was strongly  
 rejected by Breckland Planning        
 Committee on l3th May l985; less than 
 a week later Atlas Aggregates withdrew
 their application, foreseeing a       
 similar defeat at County level.       
                                       
 But what of the future?  We know this 
 was only the first battle in a long   
 campaign.                             </content>
