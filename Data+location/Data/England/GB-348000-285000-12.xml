		<title>12Delbury Farm</title>
		<content>  On 22nd May 1985 we went to visit    
 Delbury Farm, a typical Corvedale     
 farm.  Delbury is the old name for    
 Diddlebury.  Mr. Morgan has been at   
 the farm for 38 years.                
  The farm, 190 acres, is medium loam  
 and is{mixed. }100 acres is used for  
{corn,}40 acres wheat, 8 acres oats and
 52 acres barley.  They hire a combine 
 harvester.                            
  They keep roughly 840{sheep,}10 or 11
{cows}and 32{hens}that lay eggs.  They 
 used to keep pigs.  The busiest time  
 of the year for Mr. Morgan is Autumn  
 when they plough the fields and plant 
 Winter corn.  In Winter they look     
 after the animals and do fencing.  In 
 Spring they concentrate on lambing,   
 sowing and spraying.  In Summer they  
 make hay, silage and harvest the corn.
 Mr. Morgan goes to market twice a week
 to buy and sell sheep and cattle.     </content>
