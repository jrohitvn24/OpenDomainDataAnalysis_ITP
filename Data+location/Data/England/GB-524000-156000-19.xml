		<content> Banstead and Perrotts Woods are nature
 reserves which cover nearly 500 acres.
 In the centre there is the hospital   
 but it was previously the estate of   
 the Gaton family.                     
 Another 55 acres called Fames Rough,  
 are owned by Surrey County Council and
 are of scientific interest, but they  
 are managed like the whole estate by  
 Reigate and Banstead Council.         
 Some land is let for agricultural     
 purposes. A field in Holly Lane is    
 occupied by horses. Banstead car park 
 and entry to the area are both free.  
 About three hundred acres of the      
 estate are woodland with tens of      
 thousands of trees, perhaps as many as
 fifty thousand, including Silver      
 Birch, Douglas and other Firs, Copper 
 Beech, Red and Common Oak, Hazel, Wild
 Cherry, Yew, Holly, Horse Chestnut,   
 Hornbeam and many others.             </content>
