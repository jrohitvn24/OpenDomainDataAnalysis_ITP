		<title>12DARTINGTON HALL</title>
		<content> Dartington Hall is a very old place,it
 has a very famous college which people
 from all over the world come to and   
 do music, art and drama. John Holland 
 built the Hall as a holiday home. J.H.
 was a very nasty piece of work.       
 He was rich because he stole money    
 from the people he had killed and     
 probably stole all the servants from  
 the people he had killed as well. Part
 of Dartington Hall has now got a bit  
 of it used as the Devon Centre which  
 is a computer place that has got about
 20 computers and a couple of word     
 processors. Dartington Hall church was
 moved in the last couple of centuries 
 to its present position, nearer the   
 centre of trade and the community.    
 They left the tower behind because it 
 was,and still is now, the law that you
 cannot move a church tower because it 
 is a good lookout place.              </content>
