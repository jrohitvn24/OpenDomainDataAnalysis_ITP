		<title>05LOVERSALL HALL</title>
		<content> The Tudor manor house at Loversall was
 pulled down in the early 18th century 
 by its owner James Fenton, who owned  
 2,000 acres at the time. This was     
 replaced on the same plot of land by  
 Loversall Hall which he made his      
 principal residence. This Georgian    
 styled residence was a two storeyed   
 building which still stands largely   
 unchanged. It was set in a garden of  
 great beauty amidst 17.5 acres of     
 charming parkland. In 1967 Loversall  
 Hall and its 8 acres of land were     
 taken over by Malcolm Colbear and     
 his advertising agency. There are 24  
 people employed in the hall. Mr       
 Colbear himself uses what once was the
 master bedroom as his office whilst   
 a Â£40,000 computer sits where once    
 the mistress of Loversall Hall slept.
