		<title>15ASHLEY VILLAGE:OPINIONS.</title>
		<content>   Ashley village is a{pleasant place  
 but many problems threaten any{peace  
 and{stability.}The 38 children in the 
 school, of whom only seven live in the
 village, have two teachers. Closure is
 always{threatened}as facilities are   
 somewhat limited and children find it 
 hard to get to school in winter as    
 there are no buses. Loss of such an   
 active institution will{harm}the area.
 Some of the men in the garage have    
 been there for over twnty five years  
 and although they are very busy only  
 farms offer alternative employment.   
 When the sole policeman, a sergeant,  
 retires he may not be replaced even   
 though he knows most of the residents.
 His main problems are burglary, stray 
 dogs, accidents and poaching. This    
 village seems to be threatened by many
 things but at least its{rail link}to  
 Altrincham and Knutsford is an asset. </content>
