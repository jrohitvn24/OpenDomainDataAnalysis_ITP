   This school building was opened in  
 1969.There was another school in the  
 village before this but it was too    
 small.In this school at the moment    
 there are 61 children who are aged    
 between 5 and 11 years old.There are  
 six age groups.Lower infants(5-6      
 years),Upper infants(6-7 years).      
 Junior 1(7-8 years) Junior 2(8-9      
 years) Junior 3 (9-10 years) and      
 Junior 4(10-11 years).                
   The school has a large hall, which  
 is used for many different purposes.  
 It's main use is as a dining hall. The
 children can have school dinners which
 are prepared at Heslington school or  
 they bring their own.                 
   The field is very big for a school  
 of this size. It is big enough for    
 football, cricket and rounders.
