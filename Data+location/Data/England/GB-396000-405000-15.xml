		<content>   Uppermill, along with much of       
 Saddleworth, is a much sought after   
{residential area,}so house prices are 
 higher than surrounding areas.        
{Converted and renovated stone         
 buildings are in great demand as well 
 as newer dwellings.                   
   A large proportion of Saddleworth   
 residents are well educated, 'middle  
 class' people who mostly work in      
 neighbouring areas such as Manchester,
 Oldham or Huddersfield.Many of these  
 people have{moved into the area}only  
 recently whereas other families have  
 lived here for generations, working in
 traditional trades and crafts, which  
 have now largely disappeared. There is
 sometimes some{ill-feeling}between    
 these two groups of residents.        
   In general the social problems which
 beset other parts of the country are  
 less evident in this area.            </content>
