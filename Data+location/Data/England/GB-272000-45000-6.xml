		<title>06A DAY IN MY LIFE</title>
		<content> I usually get to school about 8.45.   
 The classroom is open so I can go in  
 and chat to my friends.If it's nice we
 go and sit under the trees on the     
 field.If we don't have an Assembly we 
 usually do Reading Workshop which is  
 lots of different kinds of reading.   
 After that we did maths and Problems  
 and then finished some Project work on
 Europe.                               
 At lunchtime a few of us had a        
 Recorder group.We are learning some   
 music by Mozart.I had my packed lunch 
 and played on the field with my       
 friends.                              
 In the afternoon we had games and     
 played Softball which is like Rounders
 but the bat and ball are bigger.I was 
 caught out first go.                  
 After playtime we listened to a story 
 from a tape called 'The Iron Man'.    
 I like stories best of all.           </content>
