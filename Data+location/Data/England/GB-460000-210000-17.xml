		<title>17Light Industry in Oakley</title>
		<content>In  Oakley the industries are farming  
and building. There are new properties 
in Mill Road and Worminghall Road.     
They have been built at Worminghall    
because the old houses were not safe.  
The building firms are Fennell and     
Blake and Durndells . Fennell and      
Blakes vans are blue . The cattle      
kept are Friesians.There is a          
chicken farm. An  electric fence keeps 
sheep in. There is a corn field at     
the aerodrome. This is unusual because 
there was a hard run-way there .Behind 
the place at the cattle farm where the 
lorries are kept is   Hopccroft        
Transport and you can                  
often see their lorries. The biggest   
farms in Oakley are Manor Farm and     
Jericho Farm. Manor farm is on the edge
of Oakley.
