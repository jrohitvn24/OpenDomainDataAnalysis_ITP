		<content>  At 6.00am I meet a cattle lorry at   
 Stratford-on-Avon to travel round     
 farms buying and collecting calves and
 returning to the lairage at Stratford 
 about lunchtime.4 livestock officers  
 are collecting at the same time.      
  The calves in the lairage approx. 400
 are sorted into breeds, i.e. Hereford,
 Friesian, Charalais, Limousin, and    
 Simmental, and graded for quality.    
 They are then sorted into matching    
 batches and loaded back into the      
 cattle lorries and sent out to calf   
 rearers to be reared for beef and sold
 to butchers in 12 to 18 months time.  
  Then the livestock movement papers   
 have to be filled in at the office.   
  I return home to Chaceley at 7.00pm. 
 I then take my two dogs for a walk to 
 an orchard in the village which I rent
 from a farmer to keep our two horses  
 in  while my wife cooks our meal.     </content>
