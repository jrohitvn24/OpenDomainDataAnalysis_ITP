		<content> The southern border of the block      
 lies on the Limestone ridge which runs
 South-East from Lincoln, however 80%  
 of the area lies on the flood plain of
 Witham much of it below the present   
 level of the river. The predominate   
 soil is a fen peat which provides top 
 grade farmland. Farms are large arable
 concerns growing  potatoes (Main crop)
 barley,wheat,peas,sugarbeet and rape. 
 Irrigation of the potatoes ,peas and  
 sugarbeet is becoming a familiar      
 sight on the fen farms during the     
 summer months.                        
  Industrial concerns are few only two 
 employ more than 5 people. One of     
 these is a light engineering company  
 which specialises in making high grade
 equipment for the oil industry.
