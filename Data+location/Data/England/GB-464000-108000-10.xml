		<title>10SOUTHWICK MIXED FARM &amp; WOODS</title>
		<content> In our square are two farms owned by  
 Southwick Estate.  We had a conducted 
 tour around Wanstead Farm.  The       
 landscape is pastoral.   The ground is
 level and there are many trees.   In  
 the fields we saw cattle grazing.  The
 main crop is grass.   They also grow  
 potatoes and maize.   The farmland is 
 intensively managed.   The boundaries 
 of the farm are marked by deciduous   
 trees.   In Great Belney Coppice there
 were some coniferous trees.   There   
 are only a few people working on the  
 farm, the manager, his wife, two sons 
 and five other farm workers.   The    
 sheep are Mashams from Cumbria.   They
 have 150 ewes and 50 lambs, 55 or 60  
 piglets, 48 calves, one Guernsey,the  
 rest all Friesians.  The pigs are all 
 Cotswold Pigs.
