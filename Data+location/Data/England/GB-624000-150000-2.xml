		<title>02SNOWDOWN COLLIERY.</title>
		<content> Snowdown Colliery covers an area of   
 seventy acres. At the moment there are
 two hundred and sixty_two workmen and 
 twenty_one staff.                     
  There are three shafts on the site.  
 The number one shaft, which was sunk  
 to a depth of 82.6m. encountered water
 bearing chalk and today is used as a  
 water reservoir from which water is   
 pumped and used for firefighting and  
 bathing. Shaft No.2 was sunk to a     
 depth of 940m. and No.3 to 912m.      
  The shafts sunk at Snowdown first    
 reached workable coal in 1912. Most of
 the coal is used in the making of     
 electricity, the steel industry and   
 the cement industry.                  
  In March 1984 production at Snowdown 
 was halted due to a national miner's  
 strike which lasted well over a year.
