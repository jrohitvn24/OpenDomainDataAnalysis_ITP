		<title>03GEOLOGY OF THE AREA</title>
		<content>       The{bedrock}of the area is      
{Triassic Bunter Sandstone}which forms 
 a soft pale red-brown fine to medium  
 sandstone.In the west of the area the 
 sandstone forms a range of hills with 
 a north to south trend,but nowhere    
 does it appear at the surface.        
       The reason for this is that the 
 area is covered by{Quaternary deposits
 to a depth of about 10m.The western   
 range of hills are covered in{boulder 
{clay}which consists mainly of stiff   
 grey clayey till deposited from       
 beneath the ice sheets.The rest of the
 area is covered in{gravel beds and    
{pebble-free sands}derived from the    
 south in the Trent valley.It is       
 thought they were deposited in a{lake 
 which covered the area as the ice     
 sheets receeded.
