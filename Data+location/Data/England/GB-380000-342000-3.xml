		<content>Matthew...I can remember there was a   
fire in Ridgmont Road,and two fire     
engines and an ambulance came.An old   
widow lived there.Nobody was hurt.I    
went for a walk to see it, all up the  
front had got burnt and some of the    
side too.                              
Robert....Every morning   the milkman  
comes in a float, and he has crates at 
the back of the float. He puts our milk
bottles by the front or back door.     
Jaime....I'll always remember my       
brother taking me and Amy up Bunny     
hill,and making a Buttercup chain.Bunny
hill is very steep. People have picnics
there.We rolled down the hill.My       
brother kicked my football down and we 
had to go and get it.                  
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
