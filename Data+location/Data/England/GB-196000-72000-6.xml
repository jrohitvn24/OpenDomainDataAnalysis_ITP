		<title>06THE BRIDGE</title>
		<content> The{Bridge}is one of the most         
 important structures in the town which
 grew up because of it.It lies on the{ 
{A39 trunk road}and is the lowest      
 bridge on the{River Camel}and there   
 are no other bridges for several      
 miles.It joins the two halves of the  
 town of{Wadebridge.}This medieval     
 bridge was built in{1485}and was{96m} 
 long and{2.7m}wide with 17 Gothic     
 arches.After the first widening in{   
{1852-3}it was{4.5m}wide.It was widened
 again in{1963}and is now{11.5m}wide.  
 The bridge is made of local stone with
 granite coping stones.Man made islands
 were constructed to increase the river
 flow.The swans nest every year on the 
 islands.The bridge is lit by sodium   
 lights and there are hanging baskets  
 of flowers on the lamp posts every    
 summer.
