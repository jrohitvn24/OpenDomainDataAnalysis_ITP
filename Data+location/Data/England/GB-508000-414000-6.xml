 My hobby is model making. I do it in  
 the winter when it is too cold to play
 outside and there is nothing to do. I 
 go and get my glue and my paints and  
 the model kit. I have got a new model,
 it is a racing car. It is quite small 
 but it is hard to make because you    
 have to put the engine together. My   
 Dad put "Goodyear" on the tyres when  
 it was finished. We are going to make 
 a cabinet to put the models in. Next I
 am making a hovercraft, there are     
 lots of parts in the set like little  
 cars that go inside and the           
 propellers. The model kits are made   
 from plastic and you fit them together
 with special glue and you paint them  
 with Airfix paints. You can get model 
 aeroplane kits out of cornflake       
 packets but they are tiny and hard to 
 make. I don't like painting them.     </content>
