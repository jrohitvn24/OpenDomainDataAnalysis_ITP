A.R.C. Western, Huntley Wood Quarry is 
a sand and gravel pit. It was purchased
by A.R.C. in April 1982 from Blue      
Circle Aggregates. It is called Huntley
Wood pit because, before it was a      
quarry it was part of the wood which   
still surrounds part of the site.      
                                       
The origin of this sand and gravel was 
a river deposit now commonly known as  
Â£Bunter Sand and Gravel' but its       
correct name is a conglomerate and     
sandstone of the Sherwood Sandstone    
Group.                                 
                                       
The quarry is now about 120ft. (approx.
40m.) deep.
