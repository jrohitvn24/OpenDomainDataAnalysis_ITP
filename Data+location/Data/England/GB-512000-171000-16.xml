 In Twickenham we see Red London       
 Transport buses. Many bus routes      
 travel through our area, to and from  
 Twickenham town centre.There are      
 single and double decker buses.       
 Fulwell Bus Garage is in our square.  
 In recent years new buses have been   
 introduced. They have toilets,        
 washrooms, refreshments and videos on 
 them.                                 
 TRAINS

 Most of the trains are electric.

 APT (Advanced Passenger Train) which  
 can go at 150 m.p.h.
