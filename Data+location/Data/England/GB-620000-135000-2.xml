		<title>02 GEOGRAPHY OF FOLKESTONE</title>
		<content>   Folkestone is sited on the Kent     
coast at the foot of the North Downs.  
Settlement on this site can be traced  
back to the Bronze Age, but by Tudor   
times the town had a population of only
500, many of whom were seamen. The     
arrival of the railway during the 19th 
century saw Folkestone develop as a    
resort; this is one of its functions   
today, along with being a cross-Channel
port, a business, conference and inter-
national festival centre, and a retire-
ment town.                             
   The growth of Folkestone during the 
second half of the 20th century has    
extended over virtually all of the flat
area at the foot of the Downs,with     
residential and light industrial       
estates being the predominant land     
uses. The latter are well served by the
M20 motorway, an artery vital to the   
continued prosperity of the town.      </content>
