		<content> Statistics for the crime rate of June 
 1984 was 417. Crime for June 1985 was 
 508. The Island is split into three   
 beats for patrolling. To cope with the
 emergencies they have a section       
 vehicle and can call a boat from the  
 Isle of Wight called 'Ashburton' which
 helps in harbour troubles. One traffic
 warden is used for the summer months  
 and another may be used if it is      
 overcrowded.There are no traffic      
 lights on the island.When an emergency
 is called in,the person taking the    
 call must make a decision on if the   
 emergency is a delayed response or an 
 instant response.
