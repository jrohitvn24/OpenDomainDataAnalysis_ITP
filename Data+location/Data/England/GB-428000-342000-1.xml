		<content>    This area is largely agricultural  
 and long-established names suggest    
 that it has always been so.  These    
 names, which suggest the previous use 
 of the area, include Hunger Hill,     
 Cocks-hut Hill, Newkennel Plantation, 
 Mill House, and Inn Farm.             
    Most people work in farming-related
 activities, as farmers or contract    
 workers.  Other occupations noted     
 include one gamekeeper, doctors,      
 teachers, ministers of the church,    
 public house employees, cement works  
 employees, lorry and tanker drivers,  
 caterers, and people who live in the  
 area but commute to Derby to follow   
 their occupations.                    
    Many of the farms are dairy farms. 
 The most popular cows are Friesians   
 because they have a good milk yield,  
 but there is also a pedigree herd of  
 Ayrshires, a few Guernseys, Jerseys,  </content>
