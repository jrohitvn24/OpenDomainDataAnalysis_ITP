		<title>17GIRL GUIDES 1st Staplefield</title>
		<content>{ Lord Baden Powell}started Guides 75  
 years ago in{1910.}Guides is quite    
 different now from when it first      
 started.                              
  We are{girls}aged from{10 _15 yrs.   
 Before that there is{Brownies}for     
 girls from{7_10 yrs.                  
  Guides are divided into{patrols}with 
{6_8 girls}in each. Each patrol has a  
 leader and a second and has the name  
 of a bird,such as the Robins,the      
 Thrushes and the Kingfishers.         
  At meetings we play games, talk about
 camping and get ready to take badges  
 in things like first aid, cookery,    
 needlework and camping.               
  When we are enrolled, we have to make
 The Guide Promise which says,'I       
 promise that I will do my best to do  
 my duty to God,to serve the Queen,to  
 help other people and to keep the     
 Guide Laws.'                          </content>
