		<title>15DODFORD FIRST SCHOOL</title>
		<content>{   Dodford First School}is a small    
 village school with 55 pupils aged 5-9
 years. It is Victorian red brick,     
 built in 1877. The outside is quite   
 ornate. It is a cross in plan. Many   
 windows are arched, but some have been
 made square. The ceiling is high.     
 Toilets and a kitchen have been added.
 There are three classrooms, one is    
 very big. There are 3 teachers but one
 only comes in the morning. Some       
 children have the same teacher for 2  
 years. There are not enough teachers  
 to change every year. Dinner, music   
 lessons and assembly take place in the
 large room. When it is cold or wet,   
 P.E. is done in the classroom with the
 furniture stacked. The playground is  
 small with bars and a climbing frame, 
 and wild flowers grow on the bank.    
 Most children come to school by car,  
 one boy travels 12 miles.             </content>
