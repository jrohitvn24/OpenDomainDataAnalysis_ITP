 All the farm families had to have an  
 extra income to help pay for the      
 running of their farm, even at        
 Hilltop. For example there was a taxi 
 driver, marine engineer, shopkeeper   
 and a teacher.On one farm both the    
 owner and his wife were part-time vets
 which must be very useful when their  
 cattle are ill. All the farms had some
 form of transport, such as a          
 land-rover or van, only the larger    
 farms had a lot of equipment. They    
 said their most useful pieces of      
 equipment were tractors,trailers,     
 haybailers, and silage harvesters.Many
 of the farms had outbuildings varying 
 in size,for storing machinery,animal  
 food and equipment. Most were a long  
 way from the main roads with cattle-  
 grids at the entrance to the tracks.  </content>
