		<title>01Dalton Village today</title>
		<content>  The village of {Dalton} is set where 
 rolling farm land joins rough moor. It
 is sited on an old drovers' road along
 which cattle were driven from Scotland
 to the South. The village appears to  
 have been divided into three areas,   
{East Dalton,Dalton Travers and Dalton.
  Important  buildings  in  the village
 are  the {Church  of  St James;}the   
{Methodist  Chapel;}the{village hall;} 
 a {general  dealers  shop  and  Post  
 Office; the {Travellers Rest} public  
 house  and  an {old  water  mill.}This
 latter   building   is   currently    
 undergoing renovation as a cottage for
 tourists.    The church was erected in
 1898 at  a cost of Â£800 and replaced a
 small chapel-of-ease.  Sunday Services
 are held only twice per month.   The  
 Methodist Chapel dates from 1855 and  
 is  still  in  use  in  spite  of  its
 external appearance.                  </content>
