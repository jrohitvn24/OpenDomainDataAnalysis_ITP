		<title>12Carnival work</title>
		<content> Cromford Carnival has been going on   
 quite a long time but was restarted   
 and improved on in 1977 Jubilee year. 
 The organiser has to go to a lot of   
 trouble getting licenses for things   
 like Collecting Boxes,Raffle,and      
 extensions for pubs.Keys Estates give 
 permission to use the Meadows.To get  
 the Actors and Actresses to come to   
 Cromford is quite a lot of trouble    
 too.Last year the carnival had to pay 
 Â£200 for somebody from Coronation     
 Street to come.The committee have to  
 get permission for the roads so that  
 no cars are allowed through while the 
 parade is going on.The police patrol  
 leads and follow the procession so    
 that no lorries run away.Many years   
 ago a lorry ran away from the         
 procession and killed three little    
 girls that is why it is so important  
 for a police patrol.                  </content>
