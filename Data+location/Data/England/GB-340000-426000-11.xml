		<title>11ANITA'S DAY AS MAY QUEEN 2</title>
		<content> The material was shadow stripe silk   
 crepe, very soft and light. There were
 3 net underskirts and one hooped. I   
 wore crocheted half gloves and a small
 head-dress circle of blue and white   
 flowers. In the afternoon we had a    
 short procession onto the playing     
 fields where I made a short speech and
 opened the sports. I changed may      
 clothes and ran in the races and went 
 on the fair with my friend. I enjoyed 
 my day and look forward to walking    
 again next year as retiring Queen.
