		<content> 1   Green Bank  Chapel  was  built  in
     1818. This  is a  United  Reformed
     Chapel.                           
                                       
 2   Cross  of  the  Hands  Chapel  was
     built  as  a  Primitive  Methodist
     Chapel.                           
                                       
 3   Windley   Baptist  Chapel  is  the
     third   remaining  Chapel  in  our
     area.

     All of the above are  built of red
 brick.  All are  well  maintained  and
 regular  services   are  held  in each
 building. There  are   three   disused
 chapels  in  the  area    which    now
 function  as  a  residence, a  storage
 building  and a meeting place.        </content>
