		<title>15SAVING SWANS IN WINDSOR</title>
		<content>{Zylla Cooke}is a vet's wife who looks 
 after swans and other animals. In the 
 Windsor area she helps injured swans  
 to get back to health and back on the 
 river. The problems concerning swans  
 are lead poisoning due to fishing     
 weights getting stuck in their throat,
 also nylon line gets stuck too. The   
 way it affects the swans is they      
 develop a kink in their necks.        
 Sometimes they are not able to fly or 
 walk.                                 
                                       
{Mrs. Cooke}uses drugs to cure them and
 it takes about 6 - 8 months to cure   
 their illness.                        
                                       
 The public reaction is now quite good 
 but sometimes people do not realise   
 that these beautiful birds could      
 become extinct. We can help by not    
 throwing litter in the water.         </content>
