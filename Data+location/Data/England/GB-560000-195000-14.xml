		<title>14The Rayleigh Road (A129)</title>
		<content> Our school lies just off the main road
 from Billericay to Brentwood.We have  
 had a petition in the library and at  
 the local D.I.Y store so that people  
 can sign it and request that a pelican
 crossing be installed.One thousand    
 seven hundred people signed it.       
  Brentwood Traffic Police have said   
 that there have been 13 accidents in  
 the area over the last two years. One 
 accident earlier this year was fatal.A
 member of our class was also involved 
 with a car.We visited the crossing a  
 few days ago and noticed that a safety
 barrier has been put near the crossing
 .We also counted the number of        
 vehicles which went over the crossing 
 and recorded them_one car every three 
 seconds and that was during a quiet   
 part of the afternoon. A"High Risk    
 Accident Site"has also been           
 identified.                           </content>
