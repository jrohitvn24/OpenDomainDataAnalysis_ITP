		<title>13Dean Flower Show</title>
		<content> The main weekend of the Dean year is  
 the first in August when the Flower   
 Show is held in the Eileen Wade School
 and a marquee in the grounds.         
 The competition runs to about 70      
 classes open to the residents of Dean 
 and Shelton. The cost per entry is    
 small, the prizes small but the       
 prestige of winning is large! Everyone
 is encouraged to participate with the 
 classes covering all types of         
 vegetables, flower arranging,         
 photography and several classes for   
 the children.There is a cup for the   
 overall winner and runner up and also 
 1 to the novice with most points-     
 someone who has lived in the area for 
 less than 5 years. There is also a    
 prize for the prettiest front garden  
 as seen from the road. There are      
 stalls, teas, puppet shows and races. 
 an art exhibition of locals is held.  </content>
