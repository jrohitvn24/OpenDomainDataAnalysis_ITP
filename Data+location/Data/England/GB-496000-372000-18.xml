		<content> I spend my time reading novels and    
 doing homework.  After school I get   
 changed and I spend my time by        
 watching half an hour of television or
 if I need to go down town I go down   
 town. Then I start doing my homework  
 for about half an hour. Afterwards I  
 have a cup of tea and a biscuit and   
 watch another half an hour's          
 television.  I have my cup of tea and 
 read a chapter of the present book I  
 am reading.  Then I have my tea       
 (food). After my tea I start doing    
 another hour of homework.  Then I get 
 into bed and read another chapter of  
 my book, and I go to sleep.  That is  
 how I spend my own time.
