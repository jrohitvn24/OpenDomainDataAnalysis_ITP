		<title>09AN EVENT IN WOODTON</title>
		<content> After 60 years of silence the bells of
 Woodton church rang in all their glory
 for Morning Service on 8 Jan 84.In 4  
 years Â£10000 was raised from functions
 &amp; grants;in the newly-floored tower   
 were a new bell-frame,6 retuned bells 
 with clappers,wheels &amp; stays;in the   
 redorated ringing-room ceiling insul- 
 ation &amp; new ropes were installed for  
 the Dedication Service on 28 Jan 84.  
 Much of the work was done by volun-   
 teers.Since then the bells have rung  
 for every service and many other      
 occasions,sometimes with visiting     
 ringers,achieving quarter peals &amp; 4   
 peals of 5040 changes.                
 Helped by experienced people,locals   
 practise every week to ring call      
 changes for services.                 
 Woodton can proudly claim a new       
 variation,the "Woodton Slow Course".
