 During the year I go to some of the   
 many things going on in Prestbury.    
 Every Tuesday evening I go to Youth   
 Club where there are games and a tuck 
 shop.In June there is a Family Hoedown
 at school. Also on Tuesday evenings   
 there is a Badminton Club for         
 children and teenagers.               
    One highly celebrated day is the   
 Rose Queen Festival in June.The young 
 ones form a procession from Dale Brow 
 through the village to Bollin Grove   
 School where their parents are.There  
 are sideshows and games.              
    The village has a Flower Club a    
 National Housewive's Register a       
 Women's Institute and a Luncheon Club 
 plus many more.                       
    Prestbury is a family village where
 lots of things go on.                 </content>
