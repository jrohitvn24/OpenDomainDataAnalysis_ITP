		<title>20GENERAL REVIEW</title>
		<content> The area is dominated by extractive   
 industry namely Creswell Colliery, a  
 coal mine and Steetley Quarry, a      
 limestone quarry. Most of the people  
 who live in the area have jobs at     
 either the coal mine or the quarry.   
 They also dominate the landscape with 
 their winding gear, pit tips, chimneys
 and buildings.                        
 In contrast to this the private       
 grounds of Welbeck Abbey belong to    
 another era and have remained         
 unchanged for hundreds of years.      
 Welbeck Estates own most of the land  
 in the area and the majority of it is 
 very productive farmland.             
 Creswell is the largest settlement and
 is mainly brick built. Holbeck, High  
 Holbeck and Holbeck Woodhouse are much
 smaller settlements with many stone   
 buildings set amongst farmland, as    
 picturesque as anywhere in Britain.   </content>
