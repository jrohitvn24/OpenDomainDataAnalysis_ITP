		<title>03EMPLOYMENT IN LINTON</title>
		<content>   Linton is situated in the most      
 prosperous part of Britain.Some       
 measure of this can be gained by      
 considering the unemployment rate     
 amongst Linton's school leavers over  
 the past decade.This has never risen  
 above 4.7% and is likely to be even   
 lower this year.                      
   The village itself offers employment
 at such places as Cathodeon Crystals, 
 John Glossop Model Makers,Crofton     
 Engineering and through local shops   
 and builders.There is also some farm  
 work.The greatest stimulus to local   
 employment is the city of Cambridge.  
 Being the regional centre it offers   
 many shop and office jobs.It is also a
 major tourist centre supporting many  
 hotels and catering establishments. An
 increasing number of jobs are being   
 created in the 'High Tec' industries  
 within the orbit of the university.   </content>
