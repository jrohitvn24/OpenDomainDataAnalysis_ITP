 situated about six and a half miles   
 north _ west of Lewes,six miles from  
 Burgess Hill and Haywards Heath.It has
 two general stores,one church,two     
 pubs,and a butcher's shop. Today      
 Plumpton Green's population is nearly 
 one thousand people.The growth of the 
 village was originally due to the     
 arrival of the railway in late        
 Victorian times,when the station and  
 many of the older houses were

 community.Since there is little       
 employment in the village itself,most 
 of the people leave for London or     
 nearby towns for work each day;but    
 this travel is usually by car,and the 
 railway station is not greatly
