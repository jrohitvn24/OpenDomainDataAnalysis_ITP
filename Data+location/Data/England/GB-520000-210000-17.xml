		<title>17ATTITUDES in Welwyn G.C.</title>
		<content> Questionaires distributed to a        
 selection of households suggest the   
 following attitudes.{Religion}is very 
 important to a few and most believe it
 to be fairly important. Just over half
 attend a place of worship occasionally
 and about half think that{church}     
{buildings}should be used for a much   
 wider range of activities. National   
{politics}are very important to just   
 over half and most of the others think
 that it is fairly important. Less than
 a quarter think that 'party' politics 
 should be a part of local government. 
{Local Government}is thought to be     
 adequate by the majority but nearly a 
 quarter think that it is out of touch 
 with local needs. Questions on{Social}
{Concerns}show a need for more help for
 the elderly; general satisfaction with
 planning, youth and transport; little 
 need for more recreational facilities.</content>
