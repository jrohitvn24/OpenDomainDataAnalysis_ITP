		<content>   Our flight expert for{The Flight }  
 theme was our friend's grandad.He     
 worked on Concorde and helped us to   
 build a model with moving parts like  
 the ailerons and flaps,he also went   
 with us to Exeter Airport.One of our  
 governors told us what Exeter Airport 
 was like during the last war when he  
 worked there.We held an exhibition for
 everyone to come and see our flight   
 work and I was telling the visitors   
 about the model.                      
   Sometimes aeroplanes fly over this  
 area and take photographs,looking down
 from above.We have some in our        
 class.These made us think about       
 maps.When you look at a map it is as  
 if you are looking down,which brought 
 us on to our{Domesday Survey Project.}
   We shall follow on from Domesday    
 with a theme called{Adventure Island. 
 We hope to escape from it in a boat.  </content>
