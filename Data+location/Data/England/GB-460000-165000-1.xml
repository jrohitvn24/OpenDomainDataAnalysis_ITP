		<title>01The Kennet West of Reading</title>
		<content> The flat Kennet valley rises to low   
 hills to the south and east.  The land
 near to the river is in productive,   
 mainly arable , agricultural use.  In 
 the remaining, hillier part,          
 commercial coniferous plantations     
 predominate, interspered with isolated
 dwellings.  There are small           
 communities at Ufton Nervet and       
 Padworth.  More dwellings are         
 concentrated at Aldermaston wharf,    
 close to the intersection of the      
 principal A4 and A340 roads, and the  
 main London to Exeter railway.  There 
 is a small railway station. The Kennet
 and Avon canal is close to the railway
 line and is being restored.  Two new  
 locks (1985) and an unusual           
 semi-bascule bridge (1981) have been  
 built at Aldermaston wharf, which once
 served a brewery but is now little    
 used.                                 </content>
