		<content>{English} and {French} what a drag but{
{Science} is great, it's not boring. We
 do experiments on testing inks and    
 lots, lots more. Now{computers} put an
 end to our hate towards{Maths.}They   
 have made it so easy to learn what we 
 must.{Videos} and {films}we watch in a
 lesson then later the film brings help
 to the comprehension.                 
 We go on {school trips}roaming the    
 place, maybe a week, maybe a day but  
 what does it matter they're all great 
 fun even the pamphlets which have to  
 be done.                              
 Standing in the lesson,chanting "Good 
 Morning", queuing in the{Tuck Shop,}  
 waiting at the till to pay for your { 
{school meals,} that make us all feel  
 ill.{Craft}is good now the boys can do
{cooking}and girls{woodwork.}In the end
 we have something to show for the hard
 work we do that people don't know.    </content>
