		<content>{The White Admiral (Ladoga camilla) was
 seen in a group of around 20 in a     
 shady part of Hammerpot copse.  It is 
 black with white spots and bands.  Its
 caterpillars feed on honeysuckle      
 whilst the adult is seen in June and  
 July feeding on blackberry blossom.   
 It is local, not common and is usually
 found singly.  It is the emblem of the
 Sussex Trust for Nature Conservation. 
                                       
{A Purple Emperor (Apatura iris) was   
 seen swooping to a damp patch in Upper
 Wepham wood with the White Admirals at
 Hammerpot. It is local, not common and
 elusive, spending most of the time in 
 the tree tops.  It breeds in well     
 established oak woodlands and feeds on
 sallow and willow.  The adult is found
 in July and August.  It is large      
 (wingspan 70 mm) with iridescent      
 purple wings.                         </content>
