		<title>07AMBERLEY SOCIAL LIFE</title>
		<content> The population is about 500. Mainly   
 retired people live in the            
 conservation part of the village.     
 Newer council houses, built after the 
 two wars and recent privately-owned   
 houses, have younger families.        
 Shopping is done mainly in the one    
 village store/Post Office. Other      
 shopping is in Storrington, Worthing  
 or Chichester of where people's work  
 is. Nearly all houses have one or more
 cars. There is a mini-bus service. The
 railway is used to some extent.       
 Amberley hosteleries are used mostly  
 for drinks and evening meals. Cinema  
 and theatre visits are infrequent but 
 regular to Chichester, Worthing or    
 London. Clubs and societies are mostly
 in Amberley.  Few inhabitants are     
 native. All look for a bus service, a 
 speed limit and main road pavement.
