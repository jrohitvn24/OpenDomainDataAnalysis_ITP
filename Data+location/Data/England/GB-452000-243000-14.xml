she is dressed she comes downstairs to 
put the kettle on to make a cup of tea.
When I  have left for school she does  
some washing or hoovering and looks    
after my three year old brother.She    
stop for a cup of coffee and a biscuit 
at about 10.00 a.m.I come home from    
school at 12.00 and we have a snack    
lunch together.                        
 She drives my brother and his friends 
to playgroup in a nearby village and   
then serves in the village shop all    
afternoon.She cooks our tea after      
school and then has a rest watching
