		<content> Niton Undercliff is well supplied     
 with fauna,including hares,rabbits,   
 foxes,badgers and dormice.Frogs and   
 toads have much diminished,but there  
 are grass snakes,adders and some      
 lizards.One or two red squirrels have 
 been seen recently.The bird population
 has altered considerably in the last  
 40 years.All peregrine falcons were   
 lost by pesticide poisoning but       
 kestrels are returning.Pheasants have 
 appeared in some quantity,and there   
 are numerous wood-pigeons and collar- 
 doves.Many migrant birds are attracted
 to the light at St.Catherine's Point, 
 which is a favourite venue for bird   
 watchers.Botanically the Undercliff   
 is full of interest.Wild flowers and  
 ferns abound,including the rare Sea   
 Spleenwort Fern and the Purple Cow-   
 wheat.
