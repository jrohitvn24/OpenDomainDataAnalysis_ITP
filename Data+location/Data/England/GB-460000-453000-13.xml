		<title>13A Boarder's Day at Bootham</title>
		<content> Peter Bagnell aged eleven.            
 I am at a boarding school.This means  
 that I live away from home.The school 
 provides my bed and home base.I share 
 a room with three other people.Bed    
 time is at 8.40 pm and rising is at   
 7.20 am. In my bedroom are bedside    
 lockers(75cms tall),a chair each and a
 chest of drawers in which I share 1.5 
 drawers.I go down to breakfast(the    
 first meal) and have a cereal and     
 bacon and eggs.Then I return to make  
 my bed and have it passed by my       
 housemaster at 8am.Then we go to join 
 the other pupils of my age,some of    
 whom are not resident to be checked by
 our teacher.We assemble in the hall   
 and sit in Quaker silence for 10      
 minutes.The twenty people in my       
 class(1/3 are girls)then go to        
 lessons.We study French,English,Maths,
 Latin,History.     cont'd p14         </content>
