Ball Green is a small village near to  
the slightly larger village  of Norton.
The nearest town is Burslem about      
three miles away. Burslem is one  of   
the six towns of Stoke-on-Trent. Ball  
Green is built on a ridge with the     
River Trent on the east and a brook on 
the west side. On the same ridge, but  
further south is the main village of   
Norton. These two villages though once 
being completely separate are now      
joined by the large Norton housing     
estate.  Years ago every job in the    
village used to be either farming or   
coal mining but now there are many     
diffrent jobs. More people work away   
from Ball Green now. The nearest       
large mine was Chatterly-Whitfield,    
but this has been closed and is        
now a mining museum.
