		<content> The vast majority of the farmland in  
 the area is given over to crops. Farms
 are in general large and highly       
 mechanised. There has been a tendency 
 in recent years to increase the size  
 of individual fields so as to maximise
 the productivity of the land. As      
 livestock are not generally kept there
 is no need to maintain hedgerows or   
 other field boundaries; in many cases 
 there are no boundaries between roads 
 and fields. A variety of crops are    
 crops are grown - wheat is            
 particularly important especially due 
 to the high level of subsidies        
 currently available. Rape is a crop   
 that is increasing in importance.     
 Grass sometimes forms part of a crop  
 rotation system and is usually cut for
 hay. Little labour is required on the 
 farms of the area due to the high     
 degree of mechanisation.              </content>
