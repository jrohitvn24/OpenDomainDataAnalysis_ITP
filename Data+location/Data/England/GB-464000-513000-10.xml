		<content> THERE IS A CONTRAST BETWEEN THE       
 MIDDLE-CLASS DORMITORY AREA OF        
 STANGHOW AND THE ARTISAN TYPE OF      
 RESIDENTS OF THE OTHER SETTLEMENTS.   
 STANGHOW PEOPLE DO NOT SOCIALIZE      
 EXCEPT BY INVITATION WHEREAS IN THE   
 OTHER VILLAGES A STRONG COMMUNITY     
 SPIRIT PREVAILS. PEOPLE WILL HELP EACH
 OTHER OUT AND ARE VERY INVOLVED IN    
 EACH OTHER'S LIVES AND AFFAIRS.       
 EVERYONE KNOWS EVERYONE ELSE. THE     
 PEOPLE SOCIALIZE BOTH IN ACTIVITIES IN
 THE VILLAGE HALLS AND THROUGH         
 NEIGHBOURLY EXCHANGES, PARTICULARLY   
 AMONGST THE WOMEN DURING THE DAY. AT  
 CHARLTON THE VILLAGE SHOP AND POST    
 OFFICE ARE SOMETHING OF A FOCAL POINT 
 FOR THE RESIDENTS, AND THE BUSING OF  
 CHILDREN TO SCHOOLS IN BOOSEBECK AND  
 GUISBOROUGH BY CONTRACT BUSES ADDS TO 
 THE FEELING OF COMMUNITY IN THE AREA.
