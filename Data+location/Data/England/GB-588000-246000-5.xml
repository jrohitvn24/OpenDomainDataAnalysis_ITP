		<title>05HOUSEHOLDS: LAVENHAM/ACTON</title>
		<content>The part of Lavenham which lies within 
the block is composed of council and   
private housing in roughly equal pro-  
portions. The private houses are main- 
ly of detached executive type. There   
are also two very small private est-   
ates. The Council properties lie at the
very edges of the village in two sepa- 
rate estates, one linear and one       
U-shaped. In the rural area, most pro- 
perties are farmhouses. All housing    
appears to be well-maintained.         
By estimating population at 2.5 per    
private dwelling and 3.5 per council   
dwelling, one arrives at a total of 316
and 420 respectively, giving a total   
population of 736 for the block. Car-  
ownership is almost a necessity because
of the rural nature of the area.
