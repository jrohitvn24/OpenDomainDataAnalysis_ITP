		<content>9am to 5pm and on Wednesday and        
Saturday from 9am to 1pm.The top shop  
is called {Rowles}.It is rather old    
fashioned inside with lots of draws    
with special names on them.It sells    
groceries,sweets,hardware,vegetables,  
toys,fruit and ice-cream.The shop is   
closed on Sunday but opens every other 
day from 8am to 12.15pm and 2pm to 5pm 
except for Wednesday which is half day.
Another shop sells {Waterford Glass and
Crystal}.The owner used to be a glass  
blower at Waterford,Ireland.He also    
sells rather expensive pottery.People  
come from miles around to buy things.  
The last shop is an {Art Gallery}.     
Most people think that the village     
shops are more expensive than          
supermarkets in Stamford and           
Peterborough,but we have found that    
they are frequently cheaper,especially 
when the cost of travel is considered. </content>
