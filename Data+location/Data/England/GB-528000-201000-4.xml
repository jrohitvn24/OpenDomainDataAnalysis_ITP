		<content> CUFFLEY FREE CHURCH.                  
 Some Baptists first met in the Cabin  
 in 1937.when the war was over they    
 bought some land on the corner of     
 Plough Hill and King James Avenue and 
 some services were held in an old hut.
 Building of the church began in 1968  
 and was completed the following year. 
 it cost Â£28000. The old hut is now    
 used as the church hall. The Rev.J.   
 Lambert became minister of the church 
 in March 1966.                        
 CUFFLEY ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH.        
 After the war, a few Roman Catholics  
 in Cuffley met for sermons in the     
 Cabin.But as the population increased 
 they had to build a proper church and 
 the small church of St.Martin de      
 Porres,in Church Close,was built and  
 opened in 1962.
