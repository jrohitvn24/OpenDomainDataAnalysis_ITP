		<content> Our block includes half of the town   
of Barnoldswick and some picturesque   
countryside surrounding it.            
 If you looked at our block probaly    
you  would notice Weets hill first     
because it is quite high and is in the 
middle of our area. Weets has quite a  
lot of rough grass and heather growing 
on it. On the top of Weets there are   
few trees and it is quite desolate.    
There are not so many cultivated       
fields. Many dry-stone walls divide    
the land here.                         
 Below the hill the fields are divided 
by wire fences,stone walls and hedges. 
The hedges comprise many varieties of  
bushes and trees,especially Hawthorn,  
Sycamore,Ash,Beech and Horse-chestnut. 
 The land is gently rolling pasture    
dotted with many farms and             
criss-crossed with public footpaths.
