		<content> A zone of settlement from N.W. to S.E.
divides this block so that the N.E. and
S.W. corners are mainly rural.These    
areas consist of hills and valleys with
much woodland and pasture and a little 
arable land, some of which stands out  
in May when the rape-seed has its      
bright yellow flowers.                 
 Several distinct areas occur in the   
band of settlement. In the S.E. High   
Brooms is in a valley with its railway,
industry, and gas works. In the middle 
Southborough developed along the main  
London Road with its line of small     
shops, surrounded by expanding         
residential areas of all values. The   
biggest houses are to the north where  
they have magnificent views from       
Bidborough Ridge over the vale of Kent.
Bidborough with its old church and     
houses retains some village character.
