		<content>   Hill House is a private old peoples 
 home in our area which is run by      
 Mrs.Hendrick and she has 20 staff to  
 help her.Originally the building was a
 small farm house but it has been      
 extended.It is limited to 16 residents
 and at present this includes a married
 couple.The staff,who are all local    
 people,provide a 24 hour service.The  
 residents each have a private bedroom 
 and they can have their own furniture 
 in it.Because the residents are often 
 frail,baths and not showers are       
 provided.For the same reason,they have
 a lift.The staff,who are not trained  
 nurses,help to wash and dress the     
 residents and do all their shopping   
 for them.                             
   Most of the old people have not     
 lived locally but their families are  
 usually not too far away.They all seem
 to enjoy living there.                </content>
