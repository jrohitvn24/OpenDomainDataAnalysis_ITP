    There are quite a few organized    
 clubs for children and adults in our  
 village.                              
    There is a club for children on a  
 Double Decker bus, with computers,    
 space invader games, pinball and a    
 tuck shop.                            
    For the adults there is a boating  
 club, cricket club, football club and 
 the Village Hall is used both by      
 children and adults for tap dancing,  
 keep fit and whist drives.            
    Lots of people race pigeons and    
 fishing along the Severn is popular.  
 Many of the children have their own   
 ponies and take part in gymkhanas     
 around Oldbury.                       
    Gardening is popular among the     
 older adults.
