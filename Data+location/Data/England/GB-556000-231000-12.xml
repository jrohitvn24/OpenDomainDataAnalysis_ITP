		<title>12TENDRINGS FARM (HOUSE)</title>
		<content>      The house that is currently      
 standing was built in the 1500's. At  
 that time a{man-made moat}surrounded  
 the house to provide water.           
      The roof was probably thatched   
 however it has now been tiled for     
 several years. The walls show         
{extensive pargetting}and one of the   
 walls has been re-pargetted owing to  
{World War II damage.}There is still a 
 bomb crater in a nearby copse.        
      The house is now used as a family
 home. It has 3 reception rooms and a  
 kitchen downstairs with 3 bedrooms and
 a boxroom upstairs. The kitchen has an
{'Aga'}which stands in an old fire-    
 place. There is lots of old furniture 
 including a 300 year old{linen press  
 and a{Victorian knife sharpener and   
{cleaner.}There is now electricity and 
 mains water at the house but this was 
 not connected until 1955.             </content>
