		<title>02PARWICH PRIMARY SCHOOL</title>
		<content> Our school was built in 1861. We do   
 all kinds of work, like mathematics,  
 art, English, stories, topics and     
 needlework. We have a computer.       
 This week we are practising for the   
 end of year assembly for our parents. 
 It is all about moving and it has     
 taken us a long time to work it out.  
 We are doing it because our 4th years 
 and Mrs. Birch, our Infant teacher,   
 are leaving.                          
 In September, Mrs. Black from         
 Swadlincote will come to take her     
 place. But Mrs. Birch will not be far 
 away as she lives in a bungalow just  
 near to the school.                   
 We have a new headteacher this year.  
 Mr. Williams became head of our school
 in January. All the Junior age        
 childrem are in one room and in the   
 infants are in another.
