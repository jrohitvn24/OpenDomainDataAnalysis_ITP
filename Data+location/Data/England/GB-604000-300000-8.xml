		<title>08RELIGION HACKFORD CHURCH.</title>
		<content> Hackford has a fourteenth century     
 church. The fifteenth century porch,  
 facing south, is faced with knapped   
 flint and flushwork panelling. Inside 
 there is a figure of an angel in      
 stained glass and the remains of the  
 rood staircase.There is a fifteenth   
 century font with eight shafts and a  
 finely carved sixteenth century       
 chest,with a fern design on it.       
 The west facing tower contains one    
 bell. The church has a plain Norman   
 doorway, perhaps from an earlier      
 foundation.                           
  There are no places of worship       
 in Hackford other than that of the    
 Church of England.
