		<content> INTRODUCTION:                         
 Our survey area covers an agricultural
 and historical part of the chalk down-
 lands of Wiltshire. Around the area we
 find numerous Barrows and Tumulis with
 evidence of earthworks from bygone    
 days. Wooded clumps are seen dotted   
 around and these are inhabited by many
 wild animals, birds and plants. The   
 river Till runs through a lowland     
 valley, and the surrounding arable    
 farmland is used for many different   
 types of crop and general grazing for 
 sheep and cattle. During  past years a
 number of fields close to the         
 Stonehenge Monument had been taken    
 over for illegal pop festivals. Plans 
 are now in hand for a study centre.   
 Tourists from  all over the world     
 visit the area. General weather       
 conditions prevail. The climate varies
 from -10C in Winter to +80C in Summer.</content>
