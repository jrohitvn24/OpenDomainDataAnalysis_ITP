		<title>08ST RADIGUNDS ABBEY-HISTORY</title>
		<content> Richard I granted Bradsole manor to   
 the canons of St.Radigunds for the    
 establishment of a monastry.Building  
 began in 1191,continuing for 50 years.
 Site problems were encountered, the   
 bleak position made it bitterly cold  
 in winter and rough woodland tracks   
 were frequently impassable. The Abbey 
 became richly endowed with rights over
 Alkham,River,Capel and Postling       
 churches and other large areas.During 
 the late 13th century increasingly    
 secular activities were undertaken,the
 monks acting as King's representatives
 who superintended defence work at     
 Dover Castle.15th century neglect led 
 to crumbling buildings and by 1491    
 only 8 canons remained.The early 16th 
 century saw renovation of the main    
 buildings.The monastry was dissolved  
 in 1538.The stone was used to build   
 Sandgate Castle.                      </content>
