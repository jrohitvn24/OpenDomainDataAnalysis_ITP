		<content> The area we studied ran along the     
 south side of{Spring Bank West}from   
 Botanic Crossing to Pulman Street. It 
 is mainly residential _ mainly        
 privately owned houses and flats.     
 However, there are 8 small{hotels and 
{guest houses}contained in the area.   
 Situated at the bottom of Hymer's     
 Avenue is a public school called      
{Hymer's College.}It stands in its own 
 grounds and has a huge pond that, on  
 occasions,has been known to disappear.
    Spring Bank West is adequately     
 served by many bus routes. The East   
 Yorkshire Motor Company operates      
 Services 1, 2, 3, 4 and 13. Kingston  
 Upon Hull Corporation operates        
 services 14, 15, 15C, 20 and 20E.     
    The area covered has very few      
 shops. There is a D.I.Y. shop, a      
 bicycle repair shop and a car sales   
 site.                                 </content>
