 heifer calves are sold at Otley Market
 to other dairy farmers and the rest   
 are used as replacements for the      
 farmer's herd.The older cows are sold 
 to a Pontefract slaughterhouse.The    
 cows are milked twice a day and the   
 milk is collected by a tanker from the
 Milk Marketing Board.Most of the      
 farmer's income comes from livestock. 
   He employs one female full-time     
 worker.                               
   All the machinery on the farm is    
 owned by the farmer.He has three      
 tractors,manure spreader,fertilizer   
 spreader,loader,yard scraper,grass    
 mower,hay turner,2 harrows,rotavator, 
 plough,sprayer and 4 trailers.The     
 farmer cuts his hay but the barley is 
 combined and baled by a contractor.
