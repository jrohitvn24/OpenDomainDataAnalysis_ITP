		<content> THere are a number of footpaths and   
 bridleways in the area as marked upon 
 the O.S. map, but most of them are    
 barely used as they are ill-defined   
 and usage is not encouraged by the    
 landowners. Many are barely passable  
 and signposts erected under the       
 direction of the County Council during
 1984 had almost totally disappeared   
 by mid 1985. Another such exercise was
 held in November 1985 and we wait with
 baited breath to see if the signposts 
 will remain.
