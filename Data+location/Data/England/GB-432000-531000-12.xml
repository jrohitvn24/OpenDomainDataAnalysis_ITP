		<title>12HARVEST SUPPER</title>
		<content> Each year the church and village of   
 Bishop Middleham celebrates the       
 Harvest. This consists of a church    
 service in St Michael's and is usually
 held on a Thursday evening in October.
 The church is well decorated with     
 flowers,fruit and vegetables. The     
 service itself is very traditional    
 with Harvest hymns and readings.      
 Usually there is a guest vicar to     
 give the sermon.                      
 After the service there is a Harvest  
 Supper held in the village hall, which
 normally consists of pies and peas    
 provided by the local butcher.        
 Everyone is seated at long tables with
 a 'top' table being reserved for the  
 vicar and his guests. Speeches follow 
 and traditionally the results are     
 announced of the churchyard           
 competition, which the village often  
 wins.                                 </content>
