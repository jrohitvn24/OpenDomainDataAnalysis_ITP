		<title>12EPPING FOREST IN B. HILL</title>
		<content> In our block we have patches of Epping
 Forest. It is very popular for        
 riding,taking walks,boating and dog   
 walking.Riding in the Forest is       
 allowed but only on the special       
 tracks.Boating is also allowed but    
 only on certain lakes such as         
 Connaught Water (Chingford).Epping    
 Forest is only approximatly a tenth of
 its original size because the rest of 
 it has been built on.In 1882 Queen    
 Victoria gave the Forest to the people
 of London and since then it has been a
 very popular place.Parts of the Forest
 have been separated from each other   
 such as Lords Bushes.
