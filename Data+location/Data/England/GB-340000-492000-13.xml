		<title>13Winster Village Church</title>
		<content> The parish church is the only church  
 in the village, any non-conformists,  
 RCs, or people of other faiths have to
 go beyond the boundary of the village.
 Although the vicar has 3 other        
 adjoining parishes to care for a      
 service is held each day as well as   
 Sunday. It is only a smal church with 
 one bell in the open tower. Inside    
 it has bright, old stone glass in the 
 east window., and an old octagonal    
 medieval font. The organ is dated     
 1928. In 1977 a modern and unique     
 patchwork hanging was made by sisters 
 of acarmelite  monastry, given to Mrs 
 Evan Thomas, who then presented it to 
 the church. The church won the Deanery
 Award in 1983 for a truly welcoming   
 church.
