		<content>{ EAST SHEEN,}like its neighbours, used
 to have several large houses in the   
 18th &amp; 19th centuries which are now   
 only street-names - Spencer, Deanhill,
 Coval.... The present development came
 with the railway, after 1846.         
  The now sought-after cottages in     
 Westfields, Derby Road etc. were built
 to house the workers of the market    
 gardens. Their numbers were swelled by
 Irishmen fleeing the Potato Famine and
 the RC Church of St.Mary Magdalene was
 built for them.                       
  The Cambridge &amp; Oxford boat race is  
 run from Putney to Mortlake. The first
 race was run in 1856,then annually    
 except during the Wars. It no longer  
 attracts the huge crowds it did, but  
 receives worldwide TV coverage. A week
 later, since 1926, on the same        
 stretch, over 300 eights compete in   
 the Head of the River Race.           </content>
