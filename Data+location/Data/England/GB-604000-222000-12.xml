   brother arrived when I was 18.      
{                                      
{Kelly: }What time did you finish

{Mrs.Allen: }4 o'clock. At half past   
 3 the Infants, at 4 the Juniors.      
{Kelly: }What do you remember most     
 about Wivenhoe when you first moved   
 here and why?                         
{Mrs.Allen:}Well, I don't remember     
 living anywhere else. I was born in   
 Rowhedge - that's just over the river.
 I don't remember livino there. I was  
 brought over as a baby.  I first      
 lived in Anglesea Road and I can      
 remember Anglesea Road well because   
 there was a high brick wall. It went  
 all the way down the middle of the    
 road which was the boundary of        
                                       
                                       </content>
