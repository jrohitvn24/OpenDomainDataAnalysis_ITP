		<title>11SONY WAREHOUSE, THATCHAM.</title>
		<content> All the equipment that comes to the   
 Sony Factory in Thatcham has come     
 from Japan where most of it is        
 made. The items that are imported     
 include: television sets, Hi Fi       
 equipment, radios, "Walkmans", video  
 cameras, video recorders and spare    
 parts. All the equipment is stored in 
 massive warehouses which are so big   
 that about 3 football pitches would   
 fit in each. When the lorries come to 
 the Sony Factory, items are unloaded  
 and put onto palettes which are then  
 picked up by electrical fork lift     
 trucks which take them to be stacked  
 up. The factory not only stores       
 equipment, it has offices where       
 managers and secretaries work. When we
 made our visit we only saw one lot of 
 offices and they were on both sides of
 a corridor with a meeting room at the 
 end.                                  </content>
