		<content>{Tillingham Hall}is a proposed new town
 to be built on green belt land between
{Bulphan and West Horndon.}These       
 villages are about three kilometres   
 from Laindon. The people living in    
 these villages are totally opposed to 
 the venture and are trying to persuade
 the council to turn down planning     
 permission for the town.              
{Consortium Developments,}the company  
 who propose to build the town argue   
 that it will provide over 3,000 jobs  
 and will provide 14,000 houses as a   
 contribution to the 884,000 homes that
 will be needed by 1991. The town will 
 also include three primary schools,   
 one secondary school, a playgroup,    
 health centre, police station and a   
 fire station.
