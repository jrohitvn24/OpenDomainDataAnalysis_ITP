 In Countestorpe there are 3 churches: 
 St Andrews (Church of England)        
 Countesthorpe Methodist               
 Countesthorpe Baptist                 
  All 3 churches have both morning and 
 evening services.                     
    There are activities going on      
 thoughout the week at all of the      
 churches such as dance classes,youth  
 clubs and a mothers union. Some of    
 these are organised by church members 
 like prayer meetings and  some of the 
 other groups just hire out the church.
     For Catholics the nearest church  
 is St Mary's Catholic church in South 
 Wigston.This is the same with the     
 other denominations some you have to  
 go right into Leicester to worship.   
     Out of 43 children we surveyed 11 
 went to church.
