		<title>08      THE COALITE</title>
		<content>{Askern Coalite}was opened in{1929}by  
{King George V. }The coalite carbonises
 raw coal, turning it into a smokeless 
 fuel. During the process coal oils are
 produced. After this process the raw  
 coal is now coalite, which is a       
 smokeless fuel. The coalite has about 
 325 men employed. Their products are  
 shipped all over the{British Isles}and
 exports go to Scandinavia and         
 Venezuela. During the miners' strike  
 production levels were reduced to     
 match the coal available. The stocks  
 they keep vary throughout the year.   
 Maximum totals of all grades of fuel  
 will be in the tens of thousands of   
 tonnes. Coal stocks also run into the 
 tens of thousands of tonnes.
