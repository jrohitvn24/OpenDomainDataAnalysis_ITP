		<content>   The most important local craft      
 involves the long practiced harvesting
 of{withies}(young willow saplings cut 
 in rotation),which are processed and  
 manufactured into baskets and         
 containers of all shapes and sizes.The
 preparation of withies involves{      
{cutting,boiling, and beating,}to      
 arrive at the right qualities of      
 suppleness and strength.When ready the
 withies are bundled up and sent to the
 basket makers locally and further     
 afield. Quite a few basket makers are 
 blind or partially sighted but are    
 well able to produce skilled examples 
 of their craft.Sedgemoor is one of the
 most important withy growing areas in 
 the country. There is a {candlemaker} 
 in the village and several local      
{artists}who paint excellent pictures  
 of mostly rural scenes ranging in     
 price from a few to hundreds of pounds</content>
