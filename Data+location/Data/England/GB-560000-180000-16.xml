		<title>16School Day at Stifford Clays</title>
		<content>   Our school is a Junior School on the
 Stifford Clays estate.                
 8.45am.I buy my dinner ticket,then    
 meet my friends in our classroom.     
 9.10am.Register then assembly.We saw  
 the first part of 'Treasures in the   
 Snow'-can't wait for part two.        
 9.40am.Maths-my favourite subject.    
 After we are told to write about a    
 typical day.I enjoyed that-lunch bell.
 1.15pm.Break over and back to our     
 classes for 'quiet reading'.Time      
 ticked away until 'story time'.We are 
 listening to 'I am David' everyone's  
 enjoying it.For the last few minutes  
 we had a General Knowledge quiz.We    
 bring in the questions, then it's boys
 against girls.The boys are winning at 
 the moment.                           
 3.15pm.The end of an enjoyable school 
 day.
