		<content> There are many dykes between the      
 fields.                               
    At one time Eastoft was a divided  
 village,being partly in Yorkshire and 
 partly in Lincolnshire with the river 
 Don running up the middle of what is  
 now the main road.The church is to the
 North and because of this is still    
 part of the Sheffield diocese,although
 the neighbouring villages are in the  
 Lincoln diocese.                      
    Each village has a school;Eastoft  
 has about 24 pupils aged from 5 to 11 
 in a Church of England school while   
 Luddington has 51 pupils,catering     
 for the 5 to 11 year olds from the    
 village and from the neighbouring     
 village of Garthorpe.
