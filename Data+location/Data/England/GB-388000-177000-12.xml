		<title>12A Day in Mrs Jones' Life</title>
		<content> My mum started Tuesday 11th of June by
 putting a load of washing in the      
 machine, putting rubbish out for the  
 dustmen and making a shopping list.   
 She runs a{playschool}so she got ready
 for the children. When all the        
 children had arrived one of her       
 friends came to show them her new     
 baby. At twelve o'clock the children  
 left. She went{shopping}and went to   
 the bank and Sainsbury, and she then  
 left Chippenham. On the way back she  
 had to stop for petrol. When she got  
 home she put the shopping away and    
 read her new book on{microwave        
 cooking. Then she started the diary   
 for me. Dad came in for a cup of tea  
 before taking his Father to the       
 Solicitor. At about 9.00 I went to    
 bed.      by
