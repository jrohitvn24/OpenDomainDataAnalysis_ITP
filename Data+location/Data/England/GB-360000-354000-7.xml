		<content> No land is available for housing      
 development unless necessary for      
 agricultural purposes.Nine farms are  
 family farms,seven form part of       
 country estates.Cheshire C.C.own two  
 smallholdings.Parts of some farmhouses
 date back to the 17th century often   
 having been altered by landowners who 
 added their particular style of       
 architecture.There are two gentleman's
 residences,one privately owned and one
 converted into flats.One Tied Cottage 
 housing a farm worker exists at       
 Hurleston,most having been sold or    
 let.Smallholdings,no longer being an  
 economic proposition,many have been   
 purchased by commuters who have added 
 modern amenities whilst retaining the 
 character of the original buildings.  
 There are 6 pre-war Council houses at 
 Stoke and 4 houses for employees at   
 Hurleston Water Treatment Works.      </content>
