 North Mymms is recorded in the        
{Domesday Book,}1086,where it is called
 Mimmine.The first vicar was created in
 1237 and it is thought that parts of  
 his church are part of the present    
 building which goes back to the early 
 14th century.                         
 The following groups are connected    
 with the church:Sunday School,        
 Pramsters, Bellringers and Marriage   
 Preparation.There are 4 services every
 Sunday with congregations of about    
 200.Last year there were about 40     
 Christenings and 35 Weddings.         
 The west doorway was the most         
 beautiful feature in the Church but it
 would cost Â£20,000 to restore.A peal  
 of 8 bells has just been rehung for   
 the first time in the history of the  
 Church.                               </content>
