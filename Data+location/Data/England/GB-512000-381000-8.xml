		<content>    There are no schools of any        
 description in this block. There have 
 been schools in both East and West    
 Torrington in the past, but nowadays  
 the few children that live there go   
 elsewhere to school. Children are     
 collected by school buses, and taken  
 to Legsby County Primary School, if   
 they are between five and eleven, or  
 to the De Aston School if they are    
 over eleven. De Aston School is now a 
 comprehensive school, catering for all
 abilities. It is in Market Rasen,     
 which is some six miles north of the  
 Torringtons.
