		<content> I go fishing with my friend.We go to  
 the River Fowey.It is a big river.    
  The fish I catch are{Salmon}and      
{Trout.}The heaviest fish I have caught
 is a two pound Trout.The heaviest     
 Salmon I have caught is one and a     
 quater pounds.                        
  I have had my fishing rod since I was
 seven.I bought it at Trago Mills with 
 my birthday money.It costs Â£31 it was 
 made in Japan and it is 5\m long.     
  I buy bait from Trago Mills.I use    
{maggots}and{worms.}I dig the worms out
 of the garden.I catch more fish with  
 maggots.                              
  I usually go fishing on Sundays.I    
 take a drink with me.I get home at    
 tea-time.                             
  I think fishing is a good sport.We   
 see lots of wildlife like squirrels,  
 rabbits,foxes and birds.
