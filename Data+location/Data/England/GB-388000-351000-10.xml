		<title>10Fir Tree Farm, Norton</title>
		<content> Probably the oldest building in Norton
is Fir Tree Farm, which is up to 700   
years old. It is owned by Mr Harvey.   
 The farm house is made out of stone it
used to have a thatched roof but about 
100 years ago it was tiled and a brick 
extension built on.The stone  part is  
held up by metal girders to protect it 
from mining subsidence.                
 Mr Harvey has 250 cattle which are    
mainly shorthorns. He milks some of    
the cows for his own use,but mainly he 
rears the cattle for meat, grazing     
them in the fields.In the winter he    
buys hay from local farmers for the    
cows to eat.He has 68 acres of land    
and most of it is rough grazing.At the 
weekends he sells produce from a mobile
shop.                                  
 The farm used to own some fields where
the Cornhill housing estate has been   
built. They used to grow crops there.  </content>
