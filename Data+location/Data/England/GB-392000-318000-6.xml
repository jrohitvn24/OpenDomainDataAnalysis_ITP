		<content>  {Run Rabs or Tig} :-  The object of  
the game is to tig the people who are  
not on.  One person is on and stands in
the middle of the playground. The      
other players stand at one end of the  
playground.  Everyone runs to the      
other side of the playground while he  
has to tig (touch) them.  Anybody tug  
is on as well.  The game goes on until 
all are tug.  The first to be tug is   
on next game.                          
{Chain Tig} :-  This is just like      
normal tig except that when you get    
tug you have to hold hands.            
{Chain in the mud} :-  This is a       
variation of chain tig.  When a person 
has been tug he stands with his arms   
straight out until someone goes under  
his arms. Then he is free. When he has 
been tug three times he is also on.
