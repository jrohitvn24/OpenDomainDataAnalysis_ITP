		<content> In the Fairlight, Guestling, Pett area
 of East Sussex, there is one main     
 road, the A.259 from Hastings through 
 Guestling to Rye. Two other roads are 
 just wide enough for two buses to pass
 each other, the remaining roads being 
 very narrow, winding country lanes.   
 There are only pavements along the    
 roads in the centre of the villages.  
                                       
 The l98l Census showed that car       
 ownership is high: Fairlight 76.76%,  
 Guestling 78.2% and Pett 75.27%.      
 There are four garages in this area to
 service these vehicles.  Four star    
 petrol costs Â£2.04p per gallon here.  
                                       
 The nearest railway stations are 3    
 miles to the west at Ore, Hastings, or
 8 miles to the east at Rye, from where
 trains travel north to London, west to
 Eastbourne and east to Ashford, Kent. </content>
