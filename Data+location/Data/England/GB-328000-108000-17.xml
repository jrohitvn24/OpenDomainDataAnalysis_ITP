 and white{poly/cotton skirt or dress }
 and a top to go with the skirt in the 
 summer. In the winter I wear a grey   
 skirt or dress and a blouse to go with
 the skirt. My{tie}has yellow and black
 stripes on it. If it is a wet day I   
 wear a warm skirt and a warm top and  
 an{anorak}to keep me dry.I would wear 
 some{shoes}that would keep my feet dry
 rather than{sandals}.                 
 As I come to school by{car}I don't    
 usually get my feet wet.              
 S)Today I am wearing a{red skirt}and a
{black and white top.}It is quite a hot
 day.Yesterday was cold so I wore a    
{jumper}and a pair of{denim jeans.     
 We have a {school uniform }of grey    
 skirt,white shirt,grey jumper and     
 tie,but most of the older children    
 only wear it for special events like  
 Music Festivals.                      </content>
