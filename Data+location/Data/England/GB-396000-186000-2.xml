		<content>  Many of the houses in this area were 
 built in the last 20 years but made to
 look old.They look old because they   
 are built of local stone or stone that
 is made to imitate the old stone.The  
 old stone is usually Cotswold stone   
 and the imitation is usually brad     
 stone. Garsdon and Charlton have more 
 old buildings than Lea including      
 Garsdon manor which orginally         
 belonged to Malmsbury Abbey and at one
 stage was owned by an ancestor of     
 George Washington. Garsdon and        
 Charlton have more cotswold stone than
 Lea because they have most of the farm
 houses in the area and most of them   
 are made of the original local stone. 
 There are'nt many red brick houses in 
 this area. But most of the old sheds  
 are made of red brick. In our  area   
 there are only two housing estates, so
 most of the houses are detached.      </content>
