		<title>03FARMING AROUND BRIDWATER</title>
		<content>    To the south is very low lying     
 land which flooded regularly. An      
 intensive underground drainage system 
 which runs into a large open channel  
 -Stock Moor Rhyne has remedied this.  
 There were no reeds or water plants - 
 tell tale signs of badly drained land.
    This is now high quality farming   
 land used for intensive dairy farming.
 The farmers' main aim is to produce   
 large quantities of good quality milk 
 at the lowest cost. To this end, he   
 keeps Friesian cows which have the    
 highest yield of all dairy cattle and 
 he produces much silage for winter    
 feed. The milk also has a reasonably  
 high butter fat level.                
    However, the public now prefer low 
 fat milk because some medical opinion 
 is that too much animal fat is        
 unhealthy.
