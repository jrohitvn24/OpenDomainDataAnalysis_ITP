		<title>03FARMING AROUND BIGGLESWADE</title>
		<content> The generally flat &amp; open countryside 
 is put to extensive agricultural and  
 horticultual use, &amp; there are several 
 large farms &amp; holdings. Although the  
 industry is now highly mechanised, a  
 surprisingly high proportion of people
 still work actively on the land,      
 especially in tending &amp; harvesting    
 vegetables. The main crops are cereals
 with large areas devoted to sprouts,  
 cabbage, lettuce etc., and in recent  
 years oil seed rape has been grown,   
 which transforms the countryside to a 
 vivid yellow when in bloom. As well as
 vegetables of all kinds, flowers are  
 grown for marketing, adding to the    
 attractive piecemeal effect of the    
 fields. Many very large greenhouses   
 are in evidence, growing tomatoes,    
 flowers &amp; other tender plants, in par-
 ticular those where it is of material 
 advantage to have an early harvest.   </content>
