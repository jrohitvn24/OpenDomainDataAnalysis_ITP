		<content> Our religion is mostly Christian,but  
 not many children go to church.I am C 
 of E.but my mother and baby brother   
 are RC.My cousin and I used to go to  
 Sunday School,now she doesn't believe 
 God made the earth because of a       
 programme on 'Tomorrow's World'.We    
 visited All Saints and the vicar told 
 us what the church does for people    
 today.The people who go there are a   
 family,they have a table where they   
 eat bread and drink wine to remember  
 Jesus.The vicar showed me my name in  
 the register.The church warden showed 
 us round the church.We saw the stained
 glass windows and the font where      
 people are baptised or made members of
 the church,it is 700 years old.In the 
 graveyard there is an Early English   
 stone cross.I enjoyed the visit.
