		<content> Rettendon is an extended rural        
 village, the centre having developed  
 around the thirteenth century church, 
 which is situated on the brow of Curry
 Hill.  This area includes a school    
 built in 1878, village hall, Post-    
 Office cum general store, council     
 housing estate and several large      
 houses built in the last century.     
 There are other small communities a   
 mile or more from the centre of the   
 village, also scattered houses and    
 outlying farms.  Rettendon's rich     
 boulder clay has predetermined the    
 land use, primarily for intensive     
 cereal production and horticulture.   
 Rettendon is divided by the A130      
 Chelmsford to Southend road and E-W by
 the recently built B1012 South Woodham
 Ferrers to Wickford road.  Both these 
 roads carry high density traffic.
