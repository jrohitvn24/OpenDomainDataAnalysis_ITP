		<title>11CANONS PARK, EDGWARE</title>
		<content>    Canons Park is all that remains of 
 the huge Chandos Estate. The First    
 Duke of Chandos had been Paymaster to 
 the Duke of Marlborough during the    
 Dutch Wars. He bought 500 acres of    
 parkland from the profits he made in  
 this post and in it built a sumptuous 
 house, Canons. He also rebuilt St.    
 Lawrence's Church in Continental      
 Baroque style. Handel was patronised  
 by the Duke and wrote much of his     
 early music at Canons.                
    Canons did not long survive the    
 Duke. It was sold off, then destroyed 
 by fire. A cabinet-maker, William     
 Hallat, built the present house which 
 now forms part of North London        
 Collegiate School. The vegetable      
 garden became the King George Memorial
 Gardens.                              
    The School was founded by Mary     
 Beale, a pioneer of girls' education. </content>
