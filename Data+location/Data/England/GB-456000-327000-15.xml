		<title>15BUNNY PARK HALL</title>
		<content> Bunny Park Hall was built by Sir      
 Thomas Parkyns in the 18th century.   
 He enlarged the hall and built a tower
 in 1723. The tower has 5 storeys and  
 joins on to the end of the house. In  
 the tower there is a crude staircase  
 leading to the roof. On the side of   
 the tower there is the coat of arms of
 Sir Thomas Parkyns. Above the stone   
 shield is the Parkyns crest, a large  
 pineapple. The house is built of brick
 and stone. The bricks were made in the
 local brickyard. There are 8 bedrooms 
 and many more other rooms. Mr. John   
 Edwards lives there now in part of the
 hall which is a flat. He let children 
 from the school go round the hall     
 because we were doing a project about 
 the village for the Southwell 100     
 exhibition. Bunny Hall is an unusual  
 building and is being used by Central 
 Television as the setting for a film. </content>
