		<content> The manor of Temple Dinsley was part  
 of the royal estates in the Domesday  
 Book.William Rufus then gave it to    
 Bernard de Balliol and later the manor
 was given to the Knights Templar.The  
 knights exercised considerable power  
 locally until the dissolution of the  
 order in 1309.In 1348 the manor was   
 bestowed on the Knights Hospitallers  
 of St.John of Jerusalem until the dis_
 solution of the monasteries by Henry  
 V111.After that it became the resi_   
 dence of a succession of families.In  
 1714 Benedict Ithell,a City merchant, 
 bought the estate,demolished the house
 and built the central part of the     
 present building.In 1909 a new west   
 front and domestic wing were added,de_
 signed by Sir Edwin Lutyens.It re_    
 mained a family house until 1935 when 
 it became Princess Helena College.
