		<title>01GENERAL VIEW OF GODMERSHAM</title>
		<content> This is an area of outstanding natural
 beauty. There are two main areas of   
 population. Godmersham is a tiny      
 kentish hamlet hidden away off the A28
 Ashford to Canterbury road which      
 follows the Stour river valley, and   
 Mountain Street a handful of houses on
 the eastern side of a lane leading    
 from Chilham to Challock Forest. The  
 rest are scattered farmhouses.The land
 itself is either agricultural, forest 
 or coppiced beech. There are no       
 shops, inns or schools and farming is 
 the only employment in the area.      
 There is a strong spirit of           
 neighbourly help which more than makes
 up for the lack of amenities. All the 
 local people fight together to save   
 their valley from threat of           
 development and to conserve their     
 heritage.
