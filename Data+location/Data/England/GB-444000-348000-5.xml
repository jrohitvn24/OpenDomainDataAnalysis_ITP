		<content> The villages of Brinsley and Underwood
 are not well equipped with shops.The  
 majority of people visit nearby towns 
 for their weekly food shopping,notably
 Eastwood and Kimberley.The newly built
 Sainsburys in Kimberly is particularly
 popular.                              
 Tere are a handful of small stores in 
 the villages which provide groceries, 
 newspapers,drinks etc.                
 There are two post offices in         
 Brinsley,which is a spread-out        
 village,and one in Underwood.         
 A most welcome addition to the        
 facilities in Brinsley is a take away 
 Fish and chip shop.                   
 Apart from the general stores there   
 are no shops which specialize in      
 particular goods.These are found in   
 Eastwood two miles away and which is  
 joined by a frequent bus service.
