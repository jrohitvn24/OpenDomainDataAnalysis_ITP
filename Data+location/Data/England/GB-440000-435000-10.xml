		<title>10My Big Day-1985's Gala Queen</title>
		<content> At school two months before the gala  
 our Headmaster,Mr.Hewitt, drew lots to
 find the gala queen and her           
 attendants.My number came out and so  
 did those of attendants{Charlotte     
{Turner,Claire Hind, Sarah Noble,Paula 
{Fletcher and Sara Baxter.}I was so    
 pleased when my number 5 came out and 
 I couldn't wait to get home to tell my
 mum.                                  
    The months flew by and soon it was 
{gala day.}Ifelt really important as I 
 rode up Main St. with my attendants in
 a horse drawn trap.All the village    
 seemed to be watching us.It was sunny 
 and warm and I had a lovely day.I also
 enjoyed it the next day on Sunday when
 I had to attend as queen a special    
 outdoor gala service in Beckside      
 Field.
