		<content> I like the friendly nature of the     
 village community, especially the     
 village shop and school.  I miss not  
 having many girl friends my own age   
 living close by.  I dislike litter    
 left by thoughtless people and heavy  
 vehicles travelling through the       
 village especially at the sharp bend  
 near my house.  For the future I hope 
 the village school will remain open   
 and the church be used more, perhaps  
 for Sunday School.  I hope that the   
 trees and hedgerows remain untouched  
 to encourage wild life.  Finally I    
 like to think that when I grow up I   
 can find employment in the area.
