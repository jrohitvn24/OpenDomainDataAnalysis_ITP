		<content>{   Easter}brought an opportunity to   
 study the life of{Jesus Christ,}to    
 hear again the stories he had told and
 think about his teachings.  I did not 
 know anything about{Judaism}until a   
 class performed a play about{Purim.}  
 They also showed us a collection of   
 Jewish items including the scrolls of 
 law from a synagogue and clothing worn
 during worship.  We marked the{Chinese
{New Year}with stories, songs, a       
 painted dragon with 15 children inside
 and attempts at Chinese writing.  It  
 is not a religious festival, but it is
 important to my Chinese friends and we
 enjoy celebrating with them. {Ramadan 
 is an important time of fasting for   
{Muslim}people.  I do not eat my school
 dinner at the start of Ramadan as a   
 sign of my faith. {Eid}comes at the   
 end of Ramadan. At school we have a   
 party, games and decorate the hall.   </content>
