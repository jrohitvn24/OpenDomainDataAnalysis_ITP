 in the early 1900's is owned by Mr.and
 Mrs.D.Johnson.                        
  A most unusual feature of the pub is 
 that as well as being a drinking and  
 eating place,it has a post office     
 attached and two petrol pumps on the  
 forecourt.                            
  It is a very popular local inn which 
 provides bar meals at lunchtimes and  
 during the evenings.Two guest rooms   
 upstairs can provide bed and breakfast
 accommodation.The inn enters teams in 
 the dominoes and darts leagues which  
 begin in September and end in April.  
 They compete against other teams from 
 public houses in Teesdale.Winners     
 receive either a shield or small cup. 
  A team chosen from the regulars also 
 enters the quoits league.A summer     
 activity,home matches are played on   
 two pitches beside the village green. </content>
