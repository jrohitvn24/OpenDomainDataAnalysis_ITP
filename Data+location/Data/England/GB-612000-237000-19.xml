		<title>19CHANGES SINCE WW2</title>
		<content>   Mrs.Dale's family has lived in      
 Tattingstone for many generations. She
 is the school secretary and helps run 
 th sports clubs. She has seen many    
 changes in the village since the war. 
   Although the size of the village has
 not changed very much, people seem    
 richer, the roads are busier and there
 are fewer children. One of the biggest
 single changes was the flooding of the
 Alton alley to make the Alton water   
 reservoir.                            
   There were no council houses here   
 before the war. Now there are council 
 dwellings in Green Lane, Lemons Hill  
 and Glebe Close. The new houses being 
 built are much bigger.                
   There used to be four shops in      
 Tattingstone, including a saddlers and
 a blacksmiths. Now there is only a    
 general stores and post office.
