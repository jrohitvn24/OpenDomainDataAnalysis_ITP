		<content>    The fields are rotated. For seven  
 years they are used for crops and then
 for four years it is sown with grass  
 for pasture so that the land is never 
 exhausted. There is a restriction on  
 the use of nitrogen, other fertilizers
 and pesticides because this is also a 
 water catchment area. This rule was   
 put forward by the Eastbourne         
 Corporation who own all of the land.  
    To cover the five hundred acres of 
 the average farm, in this area, a     
 combine harvester, hay balers and at  
 least five tractors are necessary. The
 farmer also has to employ various     
 people to work on the farm; for       
 example, two full time and one        
 part time workers are employed at     
 Bullockdown Farm, though during the   
 harvest more people are usually       
 required.
