		<content> In the meantime S.E.B. found that     
 Newbury did not need the extra        
 electricity.So by 1980 planning       
 permission had lapsed.                
     In 1983 S.E.B.calculated correctly
 that Newbury did need the electricity,
 so they took out and dusted up the    
 1975 plans.But by then the wayleaves  
 were out of date. S.E.B. officials yet
 again went out and tried to get people
 to sign more wayleaves but now peoples
 views had changed and people did not  
 want pylons over their land and       
 destroying the countryside,as 400     
 trees would have to be felled in the  
 forest,and another 135 to Thatcham.   
 Pylons are ugly,being made of         
 galvanised steel,coated in zinc.They  
 have three arms on each side with     
 insulators like saucers,underneath.   
 This is why S.P.A.R.E. want           
 underground cables,because you cannot </content>
