		<title>11HEALE HOUSE, WOODFORD</title>
		<content>   Heale House is five miles North of  
 Salisbury and is owned by Major       
 D.A.C.Rasch. The house is built of    
 pink brick. There are eight acres of  
 garden and the River Avon runs through
 the garden and estate. There are also 
 3000 acres of land that belong to the 
 estate, where wheat is mostly grown   
 and sheep graze. Heale House is       
 extremely well hidden from the road,  
 in fact you can only see the chimneys.
 The house is situated in the Woodford 
 Valley. King Charles II hid in the    
 house and no one knows to this day    
 where he was hidden. The garden is    
 open to the public from Easter to     
 September. It is a plant centre for   
 unusual plants and shrubs and roses.  
 There is a water garden , a Japanese  
 bridge and a tea house made of rice   
 paper. People from the village come to
 work in the gardens.                  </content>
