		<title>11A FARM WORKER.</title>
		<content> As can be seen from the land-use      
 survey agriculture dominates the area 
 around Wisbech.In terms of employment 
 the land is not as important as it    
 was,but some people still have lives  
 that are linked to the land.          
 Jim starts work at 6a.m.when he comes 
 down to a light snack of tea and      
 biscuits.The clothes he wears are     
 overalls,boots and a cap.When he gets 
 to the farm Jim works with machinery  
 such as tractors,crawlers,trailers,   
 ploughs,seed-drills,potato-planters   
 and sprayers.On the land crops such   
 wheat,sugar-beet and potatoes are     
 grown.At harvest time 2 combines are  
 hired to cope with the busiest time of
 the year as far as Jim is concerned.At
 the end of the day Jim goes down to   
 the pub for a drink and a chat about  
 his main leisure activity bowls.
