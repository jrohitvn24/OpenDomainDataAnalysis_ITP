		<content>                                       
 The famous{Wall Map}was put up in the 
 Map Room of Southwick House in{May    
{l944.}It is made of plywood and shows 
 the coastline from Calais to Brest.   
 Originally it was part of a vast map  
 showing the area from North Norway    
 to Finisterre.                        
 The map was built by{Chad Valley Toys 
 from the Midlands and fitted by two   
 workmen who were incarcerated in the  
 house until after D-Day, because they 
 knew too much to be at large.         
 After D-Day the, then Captain;        
 Captain Norris decided the wall map   
 should be preserved as a national     
 relic and restoration has been        
 completed. It was decided that the    
 wall map should be{set to H-Hour      
{(actual time of the invasion) on D-Day
 and so it has remained ever since.
