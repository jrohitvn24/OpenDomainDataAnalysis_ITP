    The M1, opened in 1959 to join     
 London and Leeds.  It is a three      
 lane motorway and its gradient has    
 been made as smooth as possible by the
 use of embankments and cuttings.      
 Junction 9 which links the A5 and M1  
 is also in th area and takes up 0.25  
 sq km.                                
    In 1985 this section of motorway is
 to undergo major repair which will    
 involve its closure for two weeks and 
 a considerable amount of disruption   
 on local roads.                       
    The A5, Watling Street, is an old  
 Roman road.  It formed a main route   
 from London to Holyhead.  In 1979 it  
 was declassified from being a trunk   
 road renumbered the A5183, this was   
 done by Hertfordshire County Council, 
 to try to discourage heavy vehicles.
