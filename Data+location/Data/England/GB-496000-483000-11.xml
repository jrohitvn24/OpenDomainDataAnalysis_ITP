		<title>11Scouting and Guiding</title>
		<content> Each patrol has a patrol leader and a 
 seconder. All the patrols have names, 
 our names at our pack are of birds.   
 They are chaffinch, nightingales, king
 fishes and swallows. You and your     
 patrol have to work together and help 
 each other. Every year we go to camp  
 and you have to fend for your self.   
 There are activities too at camp so it
 isnt just work! A young guide is      
 called a brownie, an older guide is   
 called a Ranger guide. The opposite of
 a guide is a scout. At guides your    
 promise is: "I promise that I will do 
 my best to do my duty to god, to      
 serve the queen and to help other     
 people and to keep the guide law." At 
 guides you can earn badges, like      
 hostess, cooking, fitness etc. You    
 have to do a test and if you pass you 
 get a badge. Quite often at guides we 
 have a camp fire and sing songs.      </content>
