		<content> I{(Lucy Deane)}woke up, rubbed my     
 eyes, jumped out of bed and pulled    
 back the curtains. I made my bed and  
 then got dressed into my blue and     
 white checked{school uniform}at 7.30, 
 then I got my face washed and cleaned 
 my hands.                             
{                                      
{Breakfast}is down stairs in the       
 kitchen at a large wooden table. I ate
 Harvest Crunch, a wheat cereal with   
 milk and sugar. After that I usually  
 have toast and butter with some       
 Marmite and an apple.                 
                                       
 At 8.25 I run down to the paddock in  
 the garden and feed our{chickens,     
{sheep and horses.                     
                                       
 At 8.30 I jump in the car with my     
{school books}in my satchel and mummy  
 drives me to school.                  </content>
