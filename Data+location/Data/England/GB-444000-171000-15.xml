		<title>15FARMING (CONSERVATION)</title>
		<content> Both of the farms visited had         
 buildings or areas under conservation 
 orders.On the first was a thatched,   
 three sided ,open fronted barn dating 
 from the middle of the 16 century ,it 
 is at present used to store tractors  
 and has to be maintained at the       
 farmer's own expense.On the same farm 
 is a chalk quarry of great geological 
 interest in which some of the chalk   
 deposits are eight million years      
 old.Access has to be given to visitors
 now coming from as far a field as     
 America.Helmets and tunic buttons     
 dating from the civil war have been   
 turned up during ploughing .On both   
 farms there are the remains of Roman  
 encampments and on the second the site
 of a villa where a Roman tile showing 
 the paw marks of a dog was found. The 
 farmer has planted areas of woodland  
 which he regards as conservation.     </content>
