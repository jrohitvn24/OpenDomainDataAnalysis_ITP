		<content> A typical day will vary according to  
 the season.                           
 A typical June day would begin fairly 
 early with calf feeding,then a walk   
 over the fields to see the suckler    
 cows and calves and check that none   
 are sick.Fences must be checked and if
 the bull has broken the rail over the 
 water trough a temporary repair must  
 be made.After breakfast our eldest    
 daughter must be taken to meet the    
 school bus,then on to see the heifers 
 on grass keep at the neighbours,check 
 steers and ewes with lambs,getting    
 back to the house by 9am to make and  
 recieve phone calls to vet,feed       
 merchant etc.                         
     If the weather is fine the tractor
 will be fuelled and hitched up to the 
 implement such as mower,hay tedder or 
 baler,before having a cup of coffee   
 and going to the fields till lunchtime</content>
