 but prays on his own in the church.He 
 does not think beliefs will change but
 the way in which people understand    
 them will.He believes that churches   
 will exist in the future and someone  
 like a Vicar will lead the church.

 church_going should be compulsory.He  
 thinks church activities such as      
 Guides  and Scouts are good things for
 children to be involved.{He is
