		<content> Acton Beauchamp, Evesbatch, and       
 Stanford Bishop are covered by a joint
 parish council, most members of which 
 live within the block and are         
 concerned to maintain the present     
 pleasant quality of life. The other   
 three parishes have their own parish  
 councils. The District Council is     
 Malvern Hills, within the county of   
 Hereford and Worcester, and services  
 are concentrated there, although a    
 small local presence is maintained    
 at Bromyard, three or more miles      
 away.Local residents must travel      
 considerable distances to gain access 
 to government services which can      
 present problems in an area poorly    
 served by public transport.           
 Centralised services are  not heavily 
 used since no premises have sewerage  
 connections, there is no street       
 lighting and many have their own water</content>
