		<title>16A VILLAGE MUM'S DAY - 4</title>
		<content>  It's tea time, the school is cleaned,
 the girls and I are having our salad  
 before Brownies start. My older       
 daughter, Jodi, and I get into our    
 uniforms and try to remember          
 everything we need to take to the     
 village hall where we hold our        
 meetings. My younger daughter goes to 
 a friend because my husband is away on
 a course. Sometimes she comes to      
 Brownies with me, though she is only  
 5, but tonight the District           
 Commissioner is coming so we all have 
 to be on our best behaviour.          
  It's 6 o'clock but not all of the    
 Brownies have arrived. Perhaps the    
 warm weather is keeping them out at   
 play. Tonight we are going to make    
 "Good Turn Hands" which are made like 
 dancing dolls. After clearing up and  
 locking the Village hall its time for 
 home. Several girls walk with me.     </content>
