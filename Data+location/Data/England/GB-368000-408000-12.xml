		<title>12DOFFCOCKER LODGE,BOLTON.</title>
		<content> What has happened to our lodge? I can 
 remember mats of reeds floating as    
 though someone had woven them, sunsets
 reflecting on the rippling water,     
 stormy winds making the waves crash on
 the stones of the banking,ducks       
 dive-bombing into the water.What has  
 happened to our lodge?It is now a     
 muddy scrapyard.The beautiful water   
 has gone,leaving nothing but          
 rubbish,grey-brown mud and murky      
 gravel.It is a lonely place with no   
 real life.Some birds come but it does 
 not seem alive any more.I feel there  
 is nothing else there alive but me.   
   It must not be nice for the people  
 who bought a house with a good        
 view.But it is still alive!The stream 
 still runs,waiting for the plug to    
 be put in again.Frogs still live in   
 the ditches.They have not given up.
