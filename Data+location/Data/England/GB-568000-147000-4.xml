		<content> A RELATIVELY NEW BUSINESS HAS BEEN    
 OPEN NOW FOR ABOUT 18 MONTHS - IT IS  
 CALLED "UNIBAGS LTD"., AND THEY MAKE  
 POLYTHENE BAGS FOR PACKING AND SELL   
 DIRECT TO THE MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY. 
 THEIR PREMISES WERE PREVIOUSLY FARM   
 BUILDINGS INCLUDING SOME DISUSED      
 HOUSES.                               
 AT STONEHAM WE WALKED ALONG THE       
 FOOTPATH WHICH WE DISCOVERED WAS THE  
 ORIGINAL TOWPATH WHICH STARTED FROM   
 HADLOW TO HORSMONDEN AND LINKED ALL   
 THE VILLAGES TOGETHER; IT IS STILL    
 USED TODAY.                           
 THE ORIGINAL STONEHAM HOP FARM        
 INCLUDED THE OLD VILLAGE GREEN WHERE  
 FOOTBALL AND CRICKET WERE PLAYED      
 REGULARLY.SINCE THEN IT HAS BEEN A    
 MEADOW WITH "HOPPERS" HUTS NEAR THE   
 RIVER AND HAS NOW BEEN CONVERTED INTO 
 A COMPLETELY WOODED AREA.
