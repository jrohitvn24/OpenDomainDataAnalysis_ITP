		<title>09    Great Haseley School</title>
		<content>  Haseley has had a school since about 
1000.In 1647 Luke Taylor left money to 
it and in 1750 Thomas Blackhall left   
further money.This endowment became    
known as the Taylor/Blackhall Trust and
still exists today.                    
  The original school was for boys only
and the Rector was the schoolmaster.   
  The oldest surviving part of the     
school is the stone-built dining room. 
The infants room was once the village  
institute or Club.                     
  In 1930 Haseley became a senior      
Central School and continued as an     
all-age school until 1957 when senior  
pupils transferred to the new secondary
school at Wheatley.                    
  Haseley has continued as a primary   
school to the present time and now has 
40 pupils and two teachers.
