  We asked the people in the survey if 
 they supported the campaign for an    
 Ongar By-pass.134 said they did       
 strongly, 49 said a little and 29     
 didn't at all.                        
  We also asked them what they thought 
 about tipping at the LECA Works.140   
 thought it should be strictly         
 limited,45 said it should be more     
 limited than it is and 22 said it     
 shouldn't be limited at all.          
  The Epping-Ongar tube link has been  
 partially closed and a full closure   
 has been considered.75 people said a  
 full closure would affect them while  
 134 said it wouldn't affect them.
