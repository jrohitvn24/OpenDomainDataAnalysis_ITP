		<title>15GEESTS BANANAS, WARMINSTER</title>
		<content> Geests opened in 1958 and now employs 
 86 townspeople handling all sorts of  
 fruit and produce, but particularly   
 bananas, which come mainly from the   
 Windward Islands. The bananas are     
 delivered in an unripe condition, so  
 they go into a ripening room. There   
 are 41 rooms holding about 15000      
 bananas altogether: every room is     
 fumigated to kill crawling insects.   
 During ripening, which usually takes 6
 days, the air temperature must be     
 controlled to within half a degree F. 
 Bananas produce their own heat so air 
 cooling systems are used. The exact   
 temperature settings depend on where  
 the bananas came from, the stage of   
 ripening, and how long they are to    
 be held before distribution. Some     
 fruit and produce is sold locally; the
 rest is distributed by lorry to major 
 towns within 100 miles radius.        </content>
