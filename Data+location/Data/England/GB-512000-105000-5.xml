		<title>05SMUGGLER'S RESTAURANT (cont)</title>
		<content> with one full-time general assistant  
 and my wife who does the cocktail bar 
 work.During the morning the staff have
 to have everything cleaned and dusted,
 polished and filled.An average lunch  
 is around 30 people,some eating from  
 the set price Table D'Hote menu and   
 some A La Carte.We tend to sell more  
 white wine than red.The ordering of   
 the wines,beers,minerals and spirites 
 is done on Tuesday morning.All the    
 time I have to look ahead to see if   
 anything special has been ordered.The 
 lunch customers leave by 3pm and I go 
 straight to my office for 1\ hours to 
 do the bookeeping.At 5pm,I have my    
 main meal.By 6pm,I reopen the         
 restaurant ready for start of service.
 Normally we would cater for 40 diners.
 At night,I put the takings into the   
 safe,set the alarm,and go to bed      
 around 1am.                           </content>
