		<title>07CHANGES IN CHARLTON</title>
		<content>  The two ladies used to get all their 
 household shopping from the tradesmen 
 who called regularly.The grocer,baker,
 butcher,milkman,fishmonger,paraffin   
 seller and ironmonger all called.Now  
 there is just a milk delivery three   
 times a week and a travelling shop    
 that comes once a week.The post is    
 delivered daily and there is a weekly 
 refuse collection.The ladies said that
 shopping was no longer a pleasure.They
 find supermarkets very impersonal.    
  From the neighbouring village,Creech 
 Heathfield,there is a twice weekly    
 shoppers' bus to,and from,Taunton's   
 hypermarket.The service is welcomed   
 but elderly villagers felt that the   
 timing of the buses left them rather  
 rushed.                               
  Within the last five years Charlton  
 has had new water mains and has been  
 put onto a North Sea gas supply.      </content>
