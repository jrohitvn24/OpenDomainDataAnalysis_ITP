		<title>09**    HELEN'S BIRTHDAY    **</title>
		<content> My birthday is on the 23rd of         
 November. Last year my birthday was on
 a Wednesday. As my birthday is so near
 to Christmas I don't get a lot of     
 presents. I woke up at 7 o'clock and  
 dashed downstairs. The postman had not
 arrived, so I went into the lounge to 
 open up my presents. They were wrapped
 in paper with love hearts on it. I    
 opened the largest one first and in   
 there I found a jumper. It was made   
 from wool and it was blue and pink    
 striped. It also had a lace collar.   
 I opened one other parcel and in it   
 was a pair of slipper-socks. They have
 blue bottoms and creamy coloured socks
 with a blue and pink pattern on them. 
 Both my presents were very nice. I ate
 some breakfast which consisted of two 
 slices of toast with some jam on them 
 and a cup of tea with no sugar.
