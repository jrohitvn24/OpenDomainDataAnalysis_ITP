		<content>   Being a small country village,      
 amenities for the public are rather   
 limited. There is a Post Office       
 Stores, with nearby telephone box; one
 public house, the Globe; a fine       
 village hall; a garage; a church; a   
 chapel; a village green; a primary    
 school; and a farm shop a mile from   
 the village.                          
   Much use is made of the hall by     
 village organisations for meetings,   
 local events and clubs.               
   Bus services are limited. There is a
 weekday service to Exeter, once each  
 day and return; twice a week to       
 Torrington and Bideford. Most         
 households depend on their own cars   
 for shopping excursions to Torrington,
 Bideford or Barnstaple, where         
 supermarkets and discount stores are  
 available. These towns also provide   
 the nearest leisure activities.       </content>
