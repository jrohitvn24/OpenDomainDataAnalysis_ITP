		<content> Transport in this area is{extremely   
{difficult.} There is only one regular 
 bus service into{Totnes,}and only two 
 buses a day.  Recently some people in 
 the village have started a community  
 bus service which is run by           
 volunteers.  It is proving to be quite
 popular.                              
                                       
 There are no bus services to the      
 out-lying villages and farms at all.  
 Most people own a car. Those that     
 don't live at their place of work     
 usually drive to work.                
                                       
 The nearest railway station is at     
 Totnes which is on the main Plymouth  
 to Exeter line.  The trains run quite 
 frequently.
