		<title>11THE MAY FAIR</title>
		<content> There is a May Fair every year, one at
 Petherton recreation ground and one in
 the village of Over Stratton, in      
 someones garden (it's a very big      
 garden). What a May Fair is, is stalls
 and on the stalls are cakes and       
 there's a 'bring &amp; buy'which is mainly
 vegetables and fruit. There is a      
 treasure hunt stall which is grass and
 soil and a bit of water and you have  
 a little white flag on which they put 
 your name. Then you have to put it    
 where you think the treasure would be.
 There is a sack full of hay with      
 things in and you had to put your hand
 in and take something out and see what
 you have got,it is really called the  
 lucky dip. There is a metal thing that
 you had to try and get round. If you  
 touched it this little bell would     
 ring. There is also a coconut shie, a 
 roundabout and a raffle.              </content>
