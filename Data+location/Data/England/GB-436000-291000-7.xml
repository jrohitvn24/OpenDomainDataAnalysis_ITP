 There is a cricket club in Weddington 
 at Carters Field. I play in the       
 Under-13 Team. When we play cricket,  
 we have to wear gloves, pads and body 
 protection.

 Nuneaton Borough play in the Gala     
 League at the Manor Park Ground. It   
 costs 80p to stand but it is 30p more 
 if you want to sit down. The large    
 wooden stand is being replaced by a   
 metal one. This is because there was a
 fire disaster at Bradford this year   
 when many people were killed.         
{Rugby                                 
 There are 15 players in a rugby team. 
 Nuneaton has a club with a mini       
 section. Boys from 7 to 17 play each  
 Sunday. The colours of the shirts are 
 black, red and white.
