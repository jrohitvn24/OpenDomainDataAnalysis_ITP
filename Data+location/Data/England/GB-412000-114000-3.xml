		<content>    Locally, the depth of the river    
 varies greatly. The water is only one 
 foot deep at Breamore Shallows. At    
 Sandy Balls Strait it is 24ft. There  
 are depth gauges to record the rise   
 and fall of the river.                
    At Burgate Manor Farm, until about 
 five years ago, there were a lot of   
 water meadows. During the winter, the 
 hatches were regulated to allow the   
 river to flood for several days. This 
 ensured a plentiful supply of grass in
 the Spring. These meadows have now    
 been drained and cultivated.          
    One interesting thing about the    
 river at Fordingbridge is that, owing 
 to the underground streams from the   
 chalklands coming out on the gravels, 
 it is one of the five rivers in the   
 world to freeze at the bottom first.
