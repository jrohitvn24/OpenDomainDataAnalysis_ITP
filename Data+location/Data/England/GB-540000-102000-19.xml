		<title>19Sailing on Piddinghoe Pond</title>
		<content>  Our school is lucky to be near to    
Piddinghoe so we can go sailing.       
  First we have lunch, then we go and  
rig up the boats. The school has five  
boats, an Enterprise, a Topper, a      
Mirror dingy and two Tabor 320's.      
  We wear life jackets (in case we     
capsize or fall in) and a track suit.  
  We go sailing during most of the     
year. In the summer term we do capsize 
drills to learn how to bring the boat  
upright. When we go sailing we usually 
get very wet and sometimes it is very  
hair-raising.                          
  When I first capsized I was very     
panicky. I shouted "Man the life boats"
but nothing happened because our       
teacher didn't want to get wet. My     
friend tried to pull the boat up the   
right way but he couldn't. He kept on  
trying and eventually it righted itself
but the fore-deck was broken.          </content>
