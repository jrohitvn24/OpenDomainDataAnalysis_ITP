		<title>05SIMISTER VILLAGE.</title>
		<content> Simister is a village which although  
 it is now set in an between the M62   
 and M66 motorways still manages to    
 retain a unique rural atmosphere.     
 During the last twenty years new homes
 have been built in the village, but   
 many of the cottages which once housed
 farm labourers and silk weavers are   
 now being modernised and becoming very
 desirable properties. Many of the     
 villagers work in a wide variety of   
 professions, but choose to live in    
 Simister because of its rural         
 atmosphere. The village has a church, 
 one post office cum general store, one
 shop, andtwo public houses.           
 Although there are few people left who
 have been "born and bred" in Simister 
 the majority of villagers soon settle 
 to village life and fiercely defend   
 its quite life and atmosphere.
