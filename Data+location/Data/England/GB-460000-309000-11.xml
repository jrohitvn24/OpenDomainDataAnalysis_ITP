		<title>11Around Barkby.</title>
		<content>   Barkby Hall stands near the church, 
 with pasture and trees around it. A   
 brook wanders though the fields past  
 Barkby. Many footbridges cross the    
 brook and a footpath goes along one   
 side. Many large trees grow near it   
 and wild plants grow around them.     
                                       
   All round the village are farmers'  
 fields with wheat, beans and other    
 crops growing in them. Other fields   
 are used for cattle. A few nurseries  
 have fruit trees and bushes in them.  
                                       
   Barkby and Barkby Thorpe have not   
 yet been swallowed by Leicester. No   
 main road, river or railway passes    
 them. There is still enough room to   
 have a large field set aside for      
 cricket in the summer.
