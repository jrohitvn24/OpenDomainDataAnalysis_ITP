		<title>12WIVELSCOMBE ESTATE:TREMATON</title>
		<content> In the land around Wivelscombe are    
 the remains of a disused quarry.      
 Apart from slate, this also supplied  
 ochre dye. There would have been three
 houses next to the quarry, which      
 having been derelict for 80 years is  
 now thought by some to be haunted.    
 There would have been an old railway  
 track on a pulley system serving this 
 industry. Nearby are the remains of a 
 quay where barges used to take the    
 goods from the railway by river to the
 nearby sea ports.                     
 The present owners hope to recover the
 quarry as a garden adding it to their 
 existing grounds. Although these cover
 several acres divided up into many    
 fields, each field has its own name.  
 Maps of the estate show a disused     
 chapel but there is no proof of this  
 use and the building may even have    
 been a pigsty.                        </content>
