 AXMINSTER.                            
 Aminster is a small market town in    
 east Devon. The main function of the  
 town is a service center for a largely
 rural community of pastrol farmers.   
 The town is situated on the east bank 
 of the river Axe approxmately 40      
 metres above sea level. This site is  
 very old and is said to have been     
 occupied by Iron age men,Romans and   
 Saxons. Its advantages are  that it is
 free from flooding and yet controls   
 the best fording point above the sea  
 of the Axe.                           
 The river Axe gets its name from the  
 saxon "Axa"meaning fish. To day the   
 river still plays an important part in
 the life of the community by          
 providing fishing and good  walks,it  
 also floods each year..
