		<title>19THE VILLAGE POLICEMAN</title>
		<content>{PC Wynes}is Sarratt's policeman. He   
 and his family live in the police     
 house close to the green.As well as   
 looking after Sarratt he has          
 responsibility for Belsize, Bucks     
 Hill, Commonwood, Chandlers Cross and 
 part of Langleybury.  In this area    
 there are two and a half thousand     
 adults and two hundred and fifty      
 children.  PC Wynes' job is to keep   
 things in order and to get to know    
 everyone.  PC Wynes gets about by     
 riding a bike although he sometimes   
 walks.  The biggest problems are      
 caused by farmers arguing about       
 poaching and trespassers.  If anything
 gets out of hand PC Wynes calls the   
 Police Station at Rickmansworth and   
 asks for immediate back up. Watford   
 Central Police Station is where all of
 the orders come from.
