		<title>04Employment in Kingswood area</title>
		<content>     There is very little employment to
 be found in Kingswood and its         
 surrounding area as there is no real  
{industry}here. Perhaps the main form  
 of employment is{farming.}Apart from a
 few shops there is little else in the 
 area except a publishing works which  
 employs about 215 people. Kingswood is
 very much a{commuter area.            
     The area can be described as a    
 middle to upper class area and the    
 sort of jobs people do vary somewhat. 
 On the Kingswood estate there are many
{retired}people and those who work are 
 often in{finance}or are{self employed,
 often in the motor trade. In Lower    
 Kingswood more likely{occupations}are 
 such as policeman, teacher etc.       
 Because of house prices,{unemployment 
 is rare, especially in Kingswood      
 itself.                               
                                       </content>
