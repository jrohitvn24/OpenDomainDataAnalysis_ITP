		<title>01Description of the block</title>
		<content> Residential development dominates the 
 block. Older terraced houses are      
 characteristic of the northern border 
 as it fringes onto St.Helens, but the 
 bulk of Rainhill comprises post-war,  
 speculatively-built detatched and semi
 -detatched houses, some very expensive
 indeed.                               
 Grain farming dominates the farming   
 areas with some grasses.              
 Rainhill is dormitory to the          
 surrounding urban centres, the M62    
 Motorway encouraging commuting as far 
 as Manchester.                        
 Some light manufacturing is appearing 
 on a newly developed estate on old    
 waste lands to the east.              
 Sutton Manor colliery employes few    
 from Rainhill, drawing its miners from
 St.Helens.                            
 A mental hospital and a General       
 Hospital are important local employers</content>
