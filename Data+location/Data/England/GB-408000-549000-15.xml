		<title>15My Dads spare time. D.Brown</title>
		<content> In his spare time my dad goes         
 gardening. He has three large gardens 
 and one smaller garden. He grows most 
 vegetables. My favourite vegetables   
 are peas. Every he enters his best    
 vegetables in shows. He normally wins 
 something every year with his leeks,  
 as leek growing is very popular custom
 in this area. We get most of our      
 vegetables from our gardens and freeze
 them in our large freezer. My dad also
 grows flowers for my mam. He sometimes
 enters flowers in shows as he grows a 
 lot of different flowers. We have     
 flowers on our windowsils all around  
 the house. My dad weeds the garden,   
 cuts the grass and it is obvious to me
 that he enjoys gardening very much. I 
 have my own small garden at the back  
 of the house.
