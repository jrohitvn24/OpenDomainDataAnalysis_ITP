		<title>10SHILDON COUNTY LIBRARY</title>
		<content> The{County library}is in the town     
 centre{over a mile away from where I }
{live.}It is housed in a{new building }
 completed 3 years ago.When you go into
 the library you need your 3 orange    
 tickets which have your name and      
 address on them. I go onto the        
 children's section where there are    
 books for younger readers.On the tops 
 of the shelves are labels to tell you 
 what sort of books are there. To join 
 the library you have to complete a    
 pink form and take it home for your   
 parents to sign.When you have returned
 this you then get your 3              
 tickets.Afteryou have chosen the books
 you want(max.3)the librarian stamps   
 the book to show the date by which the
 book must be returned,takes one of    
 your tickets for each book,and keeps  
 this with a slip from the book.If you 
 do not return the book you pay a fine.</content>
