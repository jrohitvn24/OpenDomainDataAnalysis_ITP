		<title>02FIVE CROSSES FARM (1)</title>
		<content>    This dairy has 150 acres of grazing
 land, including the "Cave field" where
 Charlie the Hereford bull spends the  
 summer. Of 87 cows, most are black and
 white Friesian, each valued at Â£500.  
 The first milking is at 06.00h and    
 takes 3 hours - although each cow     
 needs only 5 minutes to give her milk,
 much time is used to wash the cow and 
 parlour. Also the cows are fed        
 concentrates in a nut form. At 10.00h 
 a milk tanker takes some milk to      
 Wrexham (for butter or cheese) or to  
 another dairy e.g. Rigby's of         
 Warrington. Several hundred bottles of
 milk are delivered directly each day  
 in the Frodsham area. These include   
 skimmed, semi-skimmed, long-life,     
 pasturised, sterilized and full cream.
 Some are bought for resale from other 
 dairies since the farm cannot yet     
 produce them.                         </content>
