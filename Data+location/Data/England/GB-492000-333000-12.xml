		<title>12Near Grantham:Old Somerby.</title>
		<content> The western end of the village of Old 
 Somerby lies in the area under        
 survey.As the majority of the village 
 is situated in the 3*4 kilometre block
 to the east we will only describe the 
 western end which contains some       
 housing. There is the old post office 
 now only a private dwelling house.    
 Opposite on the road to Boothby       
 Pagnell is the Fox and Hounds public  
 house. This is well known in the area 
 for the food it serves. Nearby across 
 the road is the site of an old disused
 quarry. Old Somerby is a heathland    
 village built on the limestone locally
 known as Ancaster stone.Consequently  
 the old houses of the village are     
 built of the lovely golden stone      
 similar to that used in Cotswold      
 villages.
