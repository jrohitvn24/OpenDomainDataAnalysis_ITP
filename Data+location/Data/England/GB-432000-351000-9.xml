		<content> At old Fritchley school there was     
 only 1 teacher for all the subjects.  
 Children went to school until they    
 were 14. Children had to pay a penny  
 every Monday. Some days my sister     
 couldn't go to school because my      
 mother hadn't got a penny.            
 There was a lot of home industry in   
 the early 19th century. In 1845 there 
 were 270 knitting frames, about 5     
 years later in 1850 there were 127    
 left.                                 
 About 300 people lived in Fritchley in
 1927, about 127 families. There are   
 about 611 people living in Fritchley  
 now.                                  
 A lot of village people worked in the 
 mine kilns at Ambergate, a lot of     
 people walked to Lea Mills at Belper. 
 Some worked on the mineral railroads  
 and stone quarries.  {* * * * *
