		<title>09WOODSTOCK CARNIVAL</title>
		<content>  Woodstock Carnival has been held each
year for the past four years. Each     
year theme is chosen. In previous      
years themes have been Dragons, Song   
Titles and the Circus. Lots of people  
start preparing for the Carnival long  
before it is held.                     
  The Carnival is usually held in the  
middle of July on a Saturday. Many     
local groups and charities participate 
either in the parade or the many       
stalls. The parade takes a triangular  
route around Woodstock starting at the 
Town Hall.                             
  All the stalls choose a charity for  
the proceedings to go to e.g. Heart    
Foundation, Liver Foundation, Guide    
Dogs for the Blind. It is a great      
attraction for the tourists and most   
of all a great money gainer. A good    
year will produce 1,500 pounds and     
even a bad year will make 1,000.       </content>
