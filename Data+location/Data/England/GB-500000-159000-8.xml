		<title>08Sheerwater Estate, Woking.</title>
		<content>  The Sheerwater Estate is a very well 
 planned estate built after the 1939-45
 War as a London overspill area. It    
 extends between the West Byfleet Golf 
 Course and the Basingstoke Canal. The 
 main through road is Albert Drive.    
 There are flats, semi-detached and    
 detached houses.                      
  There is a Business Park with many   
 spacious factories, including Thorn   
 EMI and Oxy Metal Industries. All the 
 factories are for light industries.   
  The shopping parade has all the usual
 shops, two churches and a small car   
 park.                                 
  For the residents the Council        
 provides a Community Centre, Athletic 
 Ground and two State Schools.         
  The Sheerwater Estate provides every-
 thing the public requires including   
 green space and tree-lined roads.
