		<content>  Although the area is very rural and  
 sparsely populated, it is served by a 
 thrice daily private bus service,     
 monday to saturday, with no sunday    
 service. The service, which completes 
 a loop around the area, is mainly used
 by children and students attending    
 schools in the local villages or the  
 schools or the college in Andover and 
 is thus heavily subsidised by         
 Hampshire County Council. The current 
 cost of a return journey to Andover is
 Â£2.40.                                
  In addition to the bus service,      
 Andover has an extensive taxi service,
 which will serve the area, but because
 of the distance involved tends to be  
 very expensive.                       
  The only other form of transport is  
 the private car. Most households have 
 at least one car, with a considerable 
 number possessing two cars.           </content>
