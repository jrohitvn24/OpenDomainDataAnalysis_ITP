		<title>15LOCAL LEGENDS IN EDGEFIELD</title>
		<content> This used to be a smuggling area,     
 being only a few miles from the coast.
 Legend has it that the Rector was on  
 the side of the smugglers, and 'brandy
 for the parson' was left in hollow    
 stones in the Rectory gateposts.      
 The old White Horse Inn still stands  
 although it is no longer an inn. We   
 are told that there was an underground
 passage from there to the coast at    
 Cley and that if you put your ear to  
 the ground you may hear the smugglers 
 singing. It was however noticeable    
 that those coming out of the inn heard
 the sound more clearly than those     
 going in.
