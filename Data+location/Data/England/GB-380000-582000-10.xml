		<content>{The Long Pack.                        
 The family from Lee Hall near         
 Bellingham went to London long        
 ago,leaving the house in the care of  
 the servants.When a pedlar came to the
 door,the maid refused to let him in   
 but let him leave his pack overnight. 
 Later she saw the pack move and       
 summoned the stable boy.He shot the   
 pack and it groaned and bled.They kept
 watch and later scared away a gang of 
 robbers.No-one knew the body in the   
 pack.It was buried and the grave was  
 marked with scissors and bobbins to   
 show it came from the "Long Pack".    
{Cuddies Well.                         
 A young girl got her hand stuck to the
 material when she tried to sew her    
 dress on a Sunday.Only the water from 
 St.Cuthbert's Well was able to cure   
 her.
