		<title>17VISIT TO N.CAVE METAL WORKS</title>
		<content>     The three of us went along to the 
 base metal works in Crosslands        
 Lane(ref.882323).  A lady came to talk
 to us in the office.  She said that   
 lorries come from all over the country
 to deliver ore and the M62 is very    
 useful to them.  They trade with      
 people from all over the world buying 
 and selling non-ferrous metals.       
 Telephones are used a lot.  The firm  
 employs 25 people from Managers to    
 process workers and it is constantly  
 expanding.  The firm only moved       
 headquarters to North Cave in 1985 but
 is l0 years old.  The factory was     
 suitable, workers lived nearby and    
 transport is easy.  The new premises  
 have proved ideal for Base Metal      
 Synergy and the Managing Director     
 lives in North Cave.
