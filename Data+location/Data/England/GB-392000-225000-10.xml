 The first church was built in 700 AD  
 by monks who lived in a priory nearby.
 In 1170 the{ BISHOP}of {WORCESTER     
 decided to make a summer residence in 
{BISHOP'S  CLEEVE.}He  wanted a grander
 church so a Norman building replaced  
 the simple Saxon one.In 1300 a chancel
 was built for the monks to have their 
 own services.In 1680 the church tower 
 fell down due to unstable foundations 
 and was rebuilt by the end of the     
 century.There is now a programme of   
 restoration.Weathered Norman carvings 
 are to be recarved.In the tower there 
 are eight bells.The church has to be  
 locked now because of vandalism.Each  
 year Â£26,000 must be raised for church
 expenses.Recently congregations have  
 increased and more sevices will be in-
 troduced for different age groups. A  
 full time rector and curate run it.   </content>
