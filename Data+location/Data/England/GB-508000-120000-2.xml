		<content>   Hidden among the fields are about 30
 buildings shown to have been here on  
 the 1840 Tithe Map. Most were formerly
 timber-framed; the local clay, though 
 cold, heavy and difficult to cultivate
 produces magnificent oak trees whose  
 timbers were always much in demand for
 house and ship-building.  Willow and  
 hazel were used with clay for wattle  
 and daub.  Large barns were also built
 this way. A few stone-built houses use
 winklestone in their walls or floors. 
 Some roofs are of fine Horsham slabs, 
 weathered to plum grey colour;  others
 are of old tiles.  There appear to be 
 no examples remaining of a thatch.    
     Many fine old farmhouses have been
 sold away from the actual farms.  This
 is a popular area for businessmen who 
 wish to live within reach of London or
 Gatwick Airport and who can afford to 
 buy and maintain such expensive homes.</content>
