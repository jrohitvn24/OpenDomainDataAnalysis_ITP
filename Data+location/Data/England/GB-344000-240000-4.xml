		<title>04Stretton Sugwas Refuse Tip</title>
		<content> The tip is operated by Hereford and   
 Worcester County Council on land owned
 by the Prudential Assurance Company.  
 It receives household refuse from     
 parts of Leominster and S.Hereford-   
 shire Districts and from the whole of 
 Hereford City. Each of these author-  
 ities collects refuse in its own area,
 the districts in plastic sacks and the
 City from dustbins, and pays the      
 County Council for use of the tip.    
 About 5OOO tons of refuse are deposit-
 ed each week, compacted mechanically  
 and covered each day with soil to     
 prevent pollution. The site is visited
 periodically by the Health and Safety 
 Inspectorate. Householders may deposit
 refuse free, but a charge is made for 
 trade refuse. Scrap metal deposited is
 sold. The tip covers about 7 acres and
 has acquired some land from the ARC   
 gravel pit adjoining.                 </content>
