		<title>05Life in Tellisford.</title>
		<content> The population of Tellisford and      
 Vagg's Hill is about 55. There are 20 
 households; 9 containing children     
 under 18 and 5 of retired people. Only
 3 households do not have a car. Home  
 life is centred on "do it yourself"   
 with no one employing full-time cooks,
 gardeners or helps. Some people have  
 part-time help for gardening or       
 cleaning. Food is often stored in     
 large deep-freezers and vegetable     
 growing is very popular. The main meal
 of the day is usually in the evening, 
 with everyone, including children     
 eating together. There is no public   
 transport. Only one house does not    
 have a telephone. Mail is delivered   
 and collected twice daily. 8 men are  
 employed in dairy farming. 5 are      
 self-employed businessmen working from
 home. There is 1 church minister and 3
 people working outside the village.   </content>
