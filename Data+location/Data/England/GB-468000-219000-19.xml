Every Tuesday from 7:30pm to 9:00pm, I 
go to Guides.There are many more Guides
who go there, and there are three      
patrols.The patrols are all names of   
birds:Nightingales, Bullfinches and    
Swallows. Every Tuesday we have patrol 
time,games,and many more things.Patrol 
time is when your Patrol gets together 
to chat about what they are going to do
in the future:Go camping,do cooking    
etc.Patrols take it in turns each week 
to decide what games to play.Our leader
usually organises trips or treasure    
hunts in nice weather.When it is hot we
often light a fire and cook over it,we 
also practise First Aid.We also learn  
different kinds of knots:Reef,Sheep    
Bend etc.Occasionally we have pop      
quiz's with the Scouts which is good   
fun!
