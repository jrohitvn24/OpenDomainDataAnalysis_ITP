		<content> The farms in my area are mainly       
{grassland.} Some are beef and sheep   
 farms.  Some crops are grown but most 
 are for feeding the animals in winter.
{There are not many very big farms.    
 The land is mostly good farmland used 
 for growning grass and crops on for   
 the animals to eat.  Most of the water
 troughs around this area are plumbed  
 in but there are a few which need     
 filling by hosepipe.  Some of the     
 slurry pits are not safe because they 
 do not have bars around the sides of  
 them.  The farm houses are not        
 normally very big.  Some of the       
 farmhouses have hooks hanging from the
 ceiling which meat was hung on years  
 ago.
