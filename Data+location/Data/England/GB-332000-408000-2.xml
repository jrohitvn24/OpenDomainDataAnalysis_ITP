		<title>02RECLAIMED MOSS LAND</title>
		<content> The designated area is reclaimed moss 
 land. Several feet of peat at variable
 depths interspersed with Shirdley Hill
 Sand, on a deep clay bed. Bog oak and 
 ligneous wood surface periodically and
 have to be dragged or dynamited out.  
 Because of the nature of the land,    
 this wood would be a serious hazzard  
 to farm machinery.  This land was     
 reclaimed several generations ago and 
 requires constant drainage.  There are
 no hedges to disect the fields and few
 trees - usually in small groups or    
 close to the small number of farms in 
 this area.  Houses and bungalows are  
 to be found in the village of         
{Haskayne, and as ribbon development   
 along parts of the moss roads.
