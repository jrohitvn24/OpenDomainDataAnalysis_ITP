		<content> Thornton Watlass has a very good      
 cricket team. They do very well in the
 league. The village green is a very   
 pretty place to play. The wicket is   
 protected by fencing when the game is 
 not being played. They remove the     
 posts to play the game. At the Buck   
 Inn wire netting is put over the      
 windows to protect them. In the       
 Village Hall a small room, the cricket
 room, acts as the pavillion. There    
 good food and refreshments are        
 provided for the teams by the         
 cricketers' wives.                    
                                       
 The cricket team belongs to the       
 Wensleydale League and does very well.
 Players are drawn from local villages.
                                       
 Darts and dominoes are played at the  
 Buck Inn but the players do not belong
 to any league.                        </content>
