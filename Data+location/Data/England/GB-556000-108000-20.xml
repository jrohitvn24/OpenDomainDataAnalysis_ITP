		<content>{BRITISH BULLDOG.} John is "It" and    
 stands in the middle of the           
 playground. The rest stand at one     
 end, chanting his name. He chooses one
 of them who must run across without   
 being caught. To catch him, John lifts
 him into the air chanting,{"British   
{Bulldog, 1, 2, 3."}He then becomes    
 "It" as well. If the runner is not    
 caught, the whole group run across    
 together. This continues until eveyone
 is caught.                            
{PRISONS.}Up to three people are "It". 
 They must catch the others and put    
 them in a circle in the middle of the 
 playground. They can be freed by      
 someone touching them.                
{POM.}One person is "It". He faces a   
 post and counts to 100,while the rest 
 hide.He then turns round.If he sees   
 someone he says{"Pom 1,2,3,"}and the  
 person's name. He is then out.        </content>
