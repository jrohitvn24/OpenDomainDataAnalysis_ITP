 local miners in{1887.}The band can    
 have up to 32 registered players. It  
 relies on local schools to supply the 
 members.                              
 The{ages range }between{10}and{70     
{years.}The band hall belongs to the   
{national coal board.}Practice sessions
 are held on Sunday mornings and       
 Thursday evenings. Over the years the 
 band has not experienced many changes 
 but they will soon need a set of new  
 instruments. This will cost around    
 Â£28,000. In{1947,}they were the       
{British Champions.}This year the band 
 will be playing at Hetton Carnival,   
 Hetton park and also the miners gala. 
 The band have also played at the      
{maypole dancing.}Most of this work is 
 voluntary as they only get paid for   
 the gala.
