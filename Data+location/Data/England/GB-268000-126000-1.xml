		<title>01Area Summary</title>
		<content>  In our area there are mostly fields  
 and woods. There are quite a lot of   
 farmers which have dairy cattle or    
 sheep but some farmers have crops.    
  We have an industrial estate. One of 
 the factories there collects the wool 
 from the local farms. The wool is     
 stored and then is sent to Barnstaple 
 to be cleaned and made into things.   
 There is also a chipboard factory on  
 its own about a mile away from the    
 others. The factory takes timber from 
 the woods and makes it into chipboard.
  Most holiday makers come to South    
 Molton to enjoy the countryside and   
 views. In South Molton there is a     
 honey farm which is very big. Many    
 visitors go there to see the bees.
