    Mrs.Footman has lived in Bosbury   
 all her life. Her husband built the   
 house 20 years ago. It looks much     
 older than 20 years though. She was   
 born in Bosbury and has lived in three
 houses. Everyday she gets up at       
 6'oclock and does her house work, and 
 then she does some gardening. She is a
 keen gardener,she has three green     
 houses and a very big garden.         
 Mrs. Footman has her own car,and she  
 shops in Malvern,Worcester, Ledbury   
 and in the local shop. Mrs.Footman    
 says she would like to see a lot more 
 employment in Bosbury.She also thinks 
 cars go far too fast through Bosbury.
