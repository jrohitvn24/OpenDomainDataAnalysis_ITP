		<title>01       OUR D BLOCK</title>
		<content> Our D block is located on the Eastern 
 edge of Barnstaple.There are Georgian,
 Victorian,and pre-war houses,also much
 council housing built since the war   
 and some recent housing estate        
 development.The new industrial area is
 sited along the former railway line   
 which is now the route the link road  
 will take to join the MS.The rest of  
 the of the block is mostly pastoral   
 farming.The most important building in
 our D block is the North Devon        
 District Hospital at Raleigh Park     
 above the town.Most areas are within  
 reasonable distance of the town centre
 some areas have a bus service and     
 there is a Little Red bus service to a
 Supermarket.Many people are employed  
 in the many small industrial units or 
 service industries and either walk,   
 bicycle,or drive to work.
