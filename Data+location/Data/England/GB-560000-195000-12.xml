		<title>12Hutton Poplars</title>
		<content>  Along the Rayleigh Road stands Bishop
 Hill Adult Education Centre and behind
 this some land known as Hutton Poplars
 which residents of Hutton have been   
 fighting for since 1975.              
  The land now 48 acres once belonged  
 to the Children's Home which was owned
 and managed by the London Borough of  
 Hackney.Much of the original farm land
 was sold over 30 years ago and has    
 become the housing estate of Long     
 Ridings.After the school closed down  
 an article appeared in the local paper
 saying that Hackney would build 288   
 houses and garages on the spare       
 land.Hutton people didn't agree and a 
 campaign was mounted to stop the land 
 being developed and to use it as a    
 park instead.The land already looks   
 like a park but walkways,play areas   
 for children,bowling greens and tennis
 courts would be added.                </content>
