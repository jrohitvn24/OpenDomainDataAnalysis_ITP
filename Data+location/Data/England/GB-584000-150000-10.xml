		<title>10CHURCHES_ANCIENT SITES</title>
		<content> The Church of England is represented  
 by two churches; St. John the Baptist 
 at Harrietsham and the small church at
 Broomfield. At Platt's Heath a small  
 chapel dedicated to St. Edmund is used
 for services as part of the living of 
 the parish of Lenham and is also used 
 as a community centre for local       
 use. In Harrietsham a small Roman     
 Catholic mission is situated near the 
 old Remand home (now closed). The     
 Jehovah's Witnesses also have a church
 not far from the parish church.       
 Recently excavations have revealed the
 remains of some very ancient          
 buildings,thought to be Saxon or Roman
 in origin, in the grounds of the      
 Rectory at Harrietsham.  Excavations  
 have also been undertaken at Runham   
 on the site of a Roman or Iron Age    
 furnace recently discovered there.
