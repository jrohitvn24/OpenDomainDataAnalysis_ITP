		<title>09TRAFFIC IN RADSTOCK.</title>
		<content>  The biggest problem in Radstock is   
 the traffic.We have traffic lights and
 people complain about them.They think 
 that there should be a roundabout     
 instead.The traffic lights were only  
 put there a couple of years ago,but   
 before that only two roads were held  
 up,the road coming from Midsomer      
 Norton and the road coming from       
 Frome.Now all of the roads are held up
 because of the traffic lights.The     
 advantages of having traffic lights is
 that it has cut down the amount of    
 accidents,but the dissadvantages of   
 having traffic lights is that it      
 creates traffic problems all day      
 especially between the times of 8am to
 9.30am and 3pm to 6pm.The lights also 
 create problems for people who wish to
 join the main roads from side roads.  
 They cannot do so because of the      
 queues.                               </content>
