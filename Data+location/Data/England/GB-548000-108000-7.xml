		<title>07Farming in Ripe</title>
		<content>      Farming is, and always will be,  
 the main occupation around Ripe. There
 are no really large farms, mainly     
 holdings of 60 to 600 acres. Most     
 farmers specialise in one aspect of   
 farming. The old farmers had a milk   
 herd, a few hens and pigs and other   
 livestock. They grew the crops to feed
 them.                                 
      There are some dairy farms, the  
 largest of which is Middle Farm,      
 Firle. Here most of the farm is       
 intensively farmed grassland, with    
 some arable and a little rough        
 grazing. The herd is Freisians and    
 give a good yield of rich milk.       
      The smaller farmers often keep   
 bullocks for their meat. All cattle   
 are kept out in the fields during the 
 drier months, usually May to October. 
 In winter the cattle are kept in barns
 and fed with hay silage and cereals.  </content>
