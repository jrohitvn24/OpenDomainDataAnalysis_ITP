		<title>20QUALITY OF LIFE TODAY</title>
		<content> To most people in the area living in  
 the country means getting away from   
 the stresses of life midst the bustle 
 and grime of large towns and cities.  
                                       
 This is threatened at times by the    
 increasing use of our rural roads by  
 heavy vehicles, and we would like to  
 see them excluded except for access.  
 We would, however, like to have more  
 buses.                                
                                       
 A lot of us have lived around this    
 area for many years, but others have  
 chosen to come to this part of the    
 country to settle. {We are fortunate  
{that our countryside has not been     
{spoilt but has been preserved for us  
{to enjoy.
