		<content> Ewelme's picturesque setting makes it 
 a popular place to visit as well as a 
 popular place to photogrpah or put    
 onto canvas. Recently professional    
 companies have come to  use Ewelmes   
 setting as the background to films.   
 one company spent three weeks filming 
 a televison series called Paradise    
 Postponed, by the writer, John        
 Mortimer. In the film Ewelme is called
 Rapstone Manor. the second film is a  
 series on well known artists.         
 Hierymous Boschs painting of the      
 Mocking of Christ is reviewed agaist  
 the background of the almshouses at   
 Ewelme. These are said to provide a   
 reasonable comparison with the kind fo
 background Bosch would have known when
 he was alive.
