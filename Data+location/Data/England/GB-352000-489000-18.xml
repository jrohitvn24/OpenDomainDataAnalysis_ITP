		<title>18BLEAZE HALL.</title>
		<content>{   Bleaze Hall}is approximately four  
 miles from{Kendal}on the road to      
{Kirkby Lonsdale.}Originally it was a  
 farm but is now a private residence.  
 An extension built by{Roger Boatman}in
 1603 converted the existing           
 rectangular shaped Hall into an 'H'   
 shape. However much of the building   
 was destroyed in the fire of 1840     
 leaving only the middle of the 'H' and
 one side still standing.              
  The present owner has unblocked a    
 number of windows that were bricked up
 some years ago, and in other parts of 
 the house has added an extra level of 
 floorboards to cover old ones which   
 have been damaged by woodworm. He     
 keeps a number of rabbits, hens and   
 ducks outside.                        
  Legend has it that the Hall is       
 haunted and that the{ghost}of a maiden
 roams its corridors.                  </content>
