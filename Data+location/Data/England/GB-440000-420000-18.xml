		<title>18Amenities in Featherstone</title>
		<content> Featherstone has no centre in which   
 clubs and societies can meet.These are
 found in the public houses,working    
 mens clubs and churches.A new library 
 with a small social centre has been   
 built and is to be opened shortly.This
 will be available to all clubs and    
 groups in the town.There will be      
 display boards for information,social 
 advice and job vacancies in the       
 centre.                               
 A childrens playground was designed by
 the Wakefield authority and built by  
 the Manpower Services Commission on   
 the land beside the railway.This is   
 locked and only opened for a couple of
 hours on a Saturday.                  
 Featherstone lacks amenities for the  
 young.Once they leave school and are  
 unable to attend the youth club there 
 is little for them to do,some go to   
 the clubs in Leeds and Wakefield.     </content>
