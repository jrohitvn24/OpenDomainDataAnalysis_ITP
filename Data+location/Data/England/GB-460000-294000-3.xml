		<title>03Religion around Kilby</title>
		<content> The block contains only three churches
 each an Anglican Parish Church. One of
 them is situated in Kilby itself      
 another St Lukes is in Newton Harcourt
 (of which only the church really comes
 into our block) the third,and most    
 interesting is St Wistans  in Wistow  
 Park. This church once served the     
 village of Wistow,now disappeared. The
 village was named after Wistan Prince 
 of Mercia who was murdered on this    
 site. Blood is still supposed to spurt
 from the spot on the anniversary of   
 his death.Of the three perhaps the    
 Kilby church is the most important    
 since along vith its church hall it is
 still a centre of village life.
