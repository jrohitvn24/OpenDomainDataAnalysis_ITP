		<title>01Review of Westward Ho!</title>
		<content> Westward Ho!, named after Charles     
 Kingsley's book, was writen in 1863.  
 75% of this block is covered by sea   
 and 25% is residential or commercial  
 and some 300 acres of commonland known
 as the Northam Burrows. The last is   
 sand dunes and rough grassland, grazed
 by sheep and horses in limited numbers
 and maintained as a Country park with 
 residential Warden. An information    
 centre has been built recently for    
 visitors. A Pebbleridge lies between  
 the sand dunes and the beach.         
 The built up areas comprise Edwardian 
 and Victorian properties, various     
 areas of modern bungalows and houses. 
 A very small shopping centre in Winter
 bourgeons in Summer months with goods 
 aimed at the tourist trade. There are 
 holiday camps of chalets, caravans and
 a B&amp;B indusrty. In the winter it      
 reverts to a quiet village atmosphere.</content>
