		<content> The area we have studied can be       
 divided into three regions. Firstly   
 the pre Second World War residential  
 streets of terraced houses on the     
 fringe ofthe town centre. Secondly    
 post war housing estates,both council 
 and privately owned, on the outskirts 
 of the town.                          
 These estates have their own self     
 contained shopping precincts and usual
 neighbourhood services such as youth  
 and community centres as well as      
 schools.                              
   Thirdly the north west and most     
 northerly areas are basically         
 agricultural land with a more rural   
 land use.                             
   The whole area forms the outskirts  
 of the main township of Stockton-on-  
 Tees, leading out to the rural        
 settlements of south Durham.
