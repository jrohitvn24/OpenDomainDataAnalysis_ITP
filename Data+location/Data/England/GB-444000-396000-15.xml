		<title>15A DAY IN CLASS "F"</title>
		<content>   In a morning I usually arrive at    
 school by 8.15 a.m.  We don't have to 
 be in school until 8.50 a.m. but I    
 come early to help Miss Wadeson-Wilcox
 who is my teacher.  The bell to mark  
 the start of the school day is rung at
 8.55 and then we line up for assembly.
 Assembly lasts about half and hour.   
 We say prayers, sing hymns and have a 
 short story told to us.  After prayers
 we come into class and have our first 
 lesson, which is usually Religious    
 Education followed by mathematics till
 10.30 a.m.  We then have a short break
 until 10.45.  After playtime we often 
 have a short period of silent reading 
 followed by language activities.  We  
 have a lunch break from 12 0'clock    
 until 1.10 p.m.  In the afternoons we 
 usually work on our topics and        
 creative activities.  On Tuesdays we  
 have a swimming lesson at the baths.  </content>
