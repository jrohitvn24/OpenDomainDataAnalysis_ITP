		<content>{Heyeswood farm meat processing plant }
                                       
 The plant is 9 years old and it used  
 to be a family dairy farm.  The meat  
 that is going to be processed is      
 bought in from neighbouring farms.    
 Veal, beef, pork and lamb are the only
 meats used there.  Some meats are     
 processed into sausages, beef burgers 
 and pates.                            
 At the plant 12 to 300 pound carcasses
 are dealt with.  When the meat comes  
 into the plant it is left at 0 degrees
 celsius for 10 days in order to       
 mature.  If they did not do this the  
 meat would be too tough and hard to   
 eat.                                  
 The meat has different grades.  The   
 letters E, U, R, O and P show the     
 different amounts of fat on the meat  
 and the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6   
 show the toughness of the meat.       </content>
