		<title>05Farming in Halstead</title>
		<content>   On Friday the 14th June a local     
 farmer came to tell us about his farm 
 for the Domesday Project.             
   He started farming to keep his      
 family farm going. They have been     
{farming in Halstead for 200 years.}He 
 has{160 acres}and{he grows wheat,     
{barley, oats, cabbages, brussel       
{sprouts, courgettes, and potatoes.}The
 animals on his farm are{sheep,}a few  
{chickens, ducks and geese.}He shears  
 the sheep himself once a year and they
 are dipped twice a year. The fleece   
 goes to a woollen mill in Ashford. He 
 sells very few sheep for meat because 
 he is trying to build up his flock.   
 His wheat goes to Germany, Belgium,   
 Holland and Poland via a local mill   
 and his vegetables to Covent Garden.  
{There are three other similar farms in
{Halstead}and two others keeping pigs  
 and chickens.                         </content>
