 i live alone in a small thatched      
 cottage. it is built with local       
 sandstone and has decorative bits of  
 ironstone in the mortar. (all the     
 modern houses are built of brick) my  
 cottage is modernised in that i have a
 bathroom and indoor sanitation and    
 electricity.  (there is no gas in the 
 vicinity) there is no other dwelling  
 within 200 yards. i have an           
 oil-fired rayburn which does all the  
 cooking and heats the water as well as
 warming the cottage. apart from that  
 heating is by electric storage heaters
 and wood fire. i have television and  
 radio, and i have a car and bicycle   
 but walk when possible. i keep a dog,a
 cat,some chickens and grow fruit and  
 vegetables in my half acre garden. i  
 am a member of the parish council. my 
 income is less than Â£7000 per annum.  </content>
