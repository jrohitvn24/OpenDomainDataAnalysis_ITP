		<title>20COMMENTS ON THE SOFTWARE</title>
		<content> I DID NOT AT FIRST REALISE THAT THE   
 TEXT IS FIRST SAVED AND THEN THE TITLE
 AND KEYWORDS ARE SAVED BY PRESSING THE
 ESCAPE KEY.THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH 
 MORE STRONGLY EMPHASISED IN THE       
 DOCUMENTATION.                        
 I TRIED TO INVOLVE THE PUPILS BY      
 MAKING 5 BACKUP COPIES FOR THEM TO    
 WORK ON,EACH WITH 4 PAGES OF TEXT TO  
 TYPE IN.HOWEVER I DID NOT REALISE THAT
 THE TEXT CANNOT BE COPIED FORM ONE    
 DISC TO ANOTHER IN THIS FASHION SINCE 
 IT DOES NOT COPY JUST A SINGLE PAGE OF
 TEXT AT ONE TIME.                     
 ENTERING OF THE COUNT DATA WAS SIMPLE 
 AND QUITE WELL EXPLAINED.             
 ON THE WHOLE THOUGH I FEEL THAT THE   
 SOFTWARE COULD HAVE BEEN MORE         
 USER-FRIENDLY AND ROBUST CONSIDERING  
 THAT JUNIOR-SCHOOL TEACHERS WERE TO   
 USE IT.                               
                                       </content>
