		<content> We went to Fishacre Farm and there    
 were three dogs there.  Then we saw   
 the farmer.  First of all we looked   
 around and saw that the farmer had    
 about six tractors and accessories.   
 He has 120 South Devon cows for       
 breeding.  The farmer grows a very    
 special crop, wheat for thatching.  He
 has thirty acres of it and gets about 
 25-30 tons from it.  About 4% of wheat
 straw sales are local.  He also grows 
 all the food for his animals by       
 himself.  He is a mixed farmer.  He   
 does make a good living and he likes  
 his job.  He said he wouldn't do it if
 he didn't like it.  He uses manure but
 no pesticides.  He uses seaweed and   
 not fertiliser.  He uses very old     
 style machinery for cutting the       
 thatching wheat and threshing it, but 
 he uses modern machinery for          
 everything else.                      </content>
