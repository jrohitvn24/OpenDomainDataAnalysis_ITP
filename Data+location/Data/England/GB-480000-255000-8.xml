		<title>08 DENTON CHURCH MURALS</title>
		<content>St.Margaret's Church Denton,stands on a
mound in the centre of the village.The 
outside of the building is very        
attractive,being built of the local    
reddish-brown sandstone but the inside 
was very plain and uninviting until the
1960's.                                
  Then it was decided that the church  
should be decorated.                   
  Mr Henry Bird(a local artist)was     
asked to design a set of murals.He used
local people as models.                
  The theme for the murals echoed the  
medieval plan thus:-                   
  At the ends of the aisles are        
Biblical scenes.The west end is        
decorated with scenes from Denton's    
History.The South side has pictures of 
interest to children while the North   
side has a picture of Salome.(It is    
dedicated to the women).The chancel    
has scenes of early Christianity.      </content>
