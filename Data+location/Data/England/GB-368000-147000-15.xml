		<title>15   Coleford Guides</title>
		<content> I joined Guides the 6th June 1985.    
 I was ten when I joined.This is our   
 taps.{"Days done, gone the sun, from  
{the seas ,from the hills,from the sky,
{all is well,safely rest, God is nigh."
         We always sing that song after
 our meeting. Guides start at 7.30 till
 9.00.When we go there we play games   
 and make things.I took my rubber      
 collection there for my badge.On the  
 30th July we are going on a{World camp
 at Cheddar.I shall be having an       
 American coming to stay with us.      
 There are guides coming from all over 
 the{world.Africa,China, Germany,Spain,
{Pakistan, Argentina, Holland,}and the 
{Isle of Wight,Turkey }and lots more.  
 A week  ago we went to the{75 years   
 of guiding party. There were lots  of 
 activities.There was a big cardboard  
 cake with a big candle.I enjoy  guides
 very much.It is a good evening out.   </content>
