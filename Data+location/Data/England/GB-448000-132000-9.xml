		<content>{The King Charles}is a very popular    
 pub.It was built in 1937 and lies at  
 the north eastern corner of the       
 village at the junction of Springvale 
 Road and Lovedone Lane. It was        
 visited in war time by members of the 
 Fleet Air Arm stationed at H.M.S.     
 Kestrel at nearby Worthy Down. It was 
 known then as the  Springvale Hotel   
 and renamed in 1972. The present      
 landlord keeps the  premises in a     
 good clean condition, the outside     
 looking very smart in its new coat of 
 paint and hand painted sign of King   
 Charles.{The Cart and Horses}was built
 during the Tudor times in 1540. It    
 started as an inn where weary         
 travellers stopped for food, drink and
 a night's sleep before continuing with
 their pilgrimage. Nowadays it is a    
 popular pub, well known for its good  
 food.                                 </content>
