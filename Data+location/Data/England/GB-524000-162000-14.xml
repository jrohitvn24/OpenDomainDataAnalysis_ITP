		<content> At the MRC Laboratories there are two 
 units.The Toxicology Unit, which      
 carries out research on the action of 
 toxic chemicals, including some that  
 might cause cancer. The other unit is 
 the Experimental Embryology and       
 Teratology Unit which studies how     
 embryos develop. Animals such as cats,
 mice and sheep are used in experiments
 as well as cells grown in the         
 laboratory. The Home Office sends     
 inspectors to check the experiments   
 are legal.                            
  BIBRA (The British Industrial &amp;      
 Biological Research Assoc.) is on the 
 same site but is a separate body. It  
 receives its funds from the Ministry  
 of Ag.Food and Fish. The research it  
 carries out is similar to MRC Labs.   
 and it also examines the safety of    
 chemicals in medicines and foodstuffs.
