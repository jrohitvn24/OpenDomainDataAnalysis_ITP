		<title>06MY FAMILY</title>
		<content> My dad works for Allen's Transport. He
 is a lorry driver and has a very big  
 lorry with a bunk bed in it. The lorry
 is like box at the front and like a   
 trailer at the back, with eight       
 wheels.. My mum is not working at the 
 moment but is looking for a job. My   
 gran is seventy-one and is fit and    
 healthy. My grandad is seventy-two.   
  My home on Irlam road is near the    
 canal and a bus stop. It used to be a 
 very big circle of grass, but is now a
 bus stop. At home I have lots of games
 which I play with my younger sister   
 Hazel. My mum likes wearing tight     
 jeans and baggy tops, while my dad    
 likes baggy jeans and tight tops. My  
 mum has curly permed hair and is      
 blond. My dad has black hair.
