		<title>15MILK QUOTAS,CALLESTICK,TRURO</title>
		<content> Callestick Farm is a 280 acre dairy &amp; 
 beef farm worked by the farmer,his son
 &amp; 2 fulltime workers(resident herdsman
 &amp; general worker from Perranporth).   
 Dairyfarming has been greatly affected
 by introduction of the E.E.C.milkquota
 system in 1984. Quotas were calculated
 on the basis of previous year's milk  
 production minus 10% of that litreage,
 the aim being to keep within a certain
 quota for the whole country.   Whereas
 there was encouragement to increase   
 dairy herds in the late 1970's, there 
 is now a penalty for overproduction, &amp;
 no subsidies for dairyfarmers.        
 Callestick Farm used appeal-tribunal  
 procedure &amp; was granted a slight      
 increase in quota.   Many farmers sold
 cows in order to cut production. While
 trend is always to improve production 
 dairyfarmers resent being unable to do
 so,as costs continue to rise.         </content>
