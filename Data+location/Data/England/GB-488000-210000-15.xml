		<title>15Roads around Aston Clinton</title>
		<content>    The main A41 road runs straight    
 through Aston Clinton it cuts the     
 village in half. In about 60 minutes  
 1090 Vehicles will have passed through
 the centre of Aston Clinton.          
    The most important road is the A41 
 then the A41(M) (Tring bypass).       
    The Upper Ickneild Way goes to     
 Wendover Woods and near Halton where  
 there is an  R.A.F base, it finishes  
 at Buckland Wharf.                    
    The Lower Ickneild Way is the way  
 to Ivinghoe, Wilstone and Marsworth.  
 There  are a lot of accidents on the  
 A41 luckily not many people are       
 killed. Many of the minor roads around
 Tring rarely get used because it is   
 country and are usually Single Track  
 Roads. This often leads to roads      
 cracking these would be repaired      
 instantly if the Council had more     
 money. So our roads go unrepaired.    </content>
