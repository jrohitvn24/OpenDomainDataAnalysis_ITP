		<title>07LEISURE IN LOCAL VILLAGES</title>
		<content>  Leisure amenities and activities in  
 the villges are somewhat limited due  
 to the small size of the settlements. 
 Questionnaires returned indicated that
 the local people would like to see    
 more leisure provision in their       
 villages, but they did not, however,  
 want to see their villages spoilt.    
  Peterborough city centre is the most 
 commonly used area for leisure        
 facilities, with many people also     
 travelling to Orton Centre for its    
 sports facilities. The number of      
 facilities available locally has      
 declined dramatically in recent years 
 due to changing population make-up and
 increasing mobility. Those who have   
 suffered most from these changes are  
 the old and the immobile who have to  
 rely on an inadequate public transport
 service to travel to nearby leisure   
 facilities.                           </content>
