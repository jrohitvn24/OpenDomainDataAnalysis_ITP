		<content> Billingborough has an Anglican Church 
 and a Methodist Chapel.Horbling has an
 Anglican Church. Members of other     
 denominations have to go to the       
 nearest towns.                        
  Billingborough Methodist Chapel runs 
 the Sunday School which children from 
 both denominations attend.            
  Church festivals are celebrated in   
 the village Churches at different     
 times of day because the Vicar has the
 charge of three congregations and     
 Sempringham Abbey. Family services are
 held once a month when members of the 
 congregation take a greater part than 
 usual in the service.
