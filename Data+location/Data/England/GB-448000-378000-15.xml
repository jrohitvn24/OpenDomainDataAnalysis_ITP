		<content> When we go home Harthill is full of   
 people playing and going to discos. We
 go to the Park and we play on the     
 swings. We go up to the BMX track and 
 have races. At 7 o'clock we go to the 
 Youth Club and play table tennis and  
 pool or go in the disco. We take Â£1   
 andget pop and crisps, take some      
 records and play them at the disco.   
 Vandals get marker pens and write     
 their names on slides, roundabouts,   
 swings and seats, and the clinic. Some
 of the older ones start fires. Someone
 has taken two planks of wood off the  
 seats and put them on the swings.     
 Litter is a bit of a problem in       
 Harthill specially in some parts, like
 the play area. Recently all the       
 classes in our school have been out in
 the village collecting litter.
