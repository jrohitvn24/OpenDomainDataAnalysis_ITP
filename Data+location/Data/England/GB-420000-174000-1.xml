		<content> Most of this area is farmland with a  
 few scattered farmhouses.The large    
 farms on the Ogbourne downs are arable
 but the farm in the village is a dairy
 farm.                                 
 Another large area is taken by a golf 
 course where local people work.Most   
 golf club members live 10 miles away  
 in Swindon.                           
 You get lovely views from the top of  
 the Ogbourne downs.The weather is     
 often dry,cool and windy.             
 The south-east part of the village    
 has a busy cafe,2 pubs,a garage,and a 
 village store.These places are used by
 hikers walking the Ridgeway,by lorry  
 drivers and travellers using the busy 
 main road, and by the local people as 
 well.
