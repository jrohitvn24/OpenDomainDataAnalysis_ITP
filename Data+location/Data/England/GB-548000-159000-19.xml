		<content>  I get up at quarter to eight and get 
 dressed.For breakfast I have cereal.We
 leave for school at half past eight   
 and get to school at ten to nine.     
                                       
  Usually we start with assembly and   
 then do maths until playtime.We have  
 play for fifteen minutes during which 
 we play football.We then write a story
 until lunch,and have three quarters of
 an hour play.In the afternoon we do   
 project work until we go home at three
 thirty,unless I am going to a club.   
 There is a bird club,art and craft    
 club,games club, drama club, gardening
 club,and computer club.               
                                       
  My sister and I go swimming after    
 school. Then we go home,watch T.V.,   
 have tea,and go to bed.
