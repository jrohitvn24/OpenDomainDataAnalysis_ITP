		<title>08 The School Association</title>
		<content> The School Association started in June
 1982.  It was opened because Mr. Bray,
 the headmaster, wanted parents to get 
 to know each other.                   
                                       
 The School's first{fund raising}event 
 was for money for curtains in the     
 school hall.  The second one was to   
 convert the village hall car park to  
 make a bigger playground.  Mr. Wright 
 was the first chairman in June 1982.  
                                       
 The School Association meets once a   
 month at Corvedale.  Mr. Wright, who  
 is now Association secretary, came to 
 talk to us about his work.  He said it
 takes up most of his spare time.      
                                       
 School governors are for looking after
 the school and making sure the school 
 is being run properly.
