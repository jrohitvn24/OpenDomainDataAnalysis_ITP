		<title>08Morwenstow-A Farmer's Day</title>
		<content> At 10:00 we dipped  the  sheep to kill
 the fleas.  We dipped  the rams first.
 They were dipped for one minute, being
 pushed under and cleaned all over.    
 They did not like it very much.  Then,
 they went  into a  place  to dry while
 the others were being done. Some lambs
 who  were  not  supposed  to be dipped
 tried to  go with  them and  had to be
 separated.  Then the dipped sheep went
 into a separate field. Two lambs  born
 today were taken down after lunch with
 some injured sheep to the others.     
 There were five horses on the farm. In
 three weeks they are taking a horse to
 a show  and Jeremy  practised plaiting
 the  horse's  mane.  Then  he  put the
 horses into a field. I rode on another
 horse.  In the  evening the farmer fed
 the calves and milked the cows.
