		<content>   The first spadeful of earth from    
 Denton Market Ground was turned on    
 October 10th 1863 by a Mr.John        
 Bentley. In the 1970's the original   
 road pattern was altered to restrict  
 traffic movement around the square.   
   Market days are Wednesdays,Fridays  
 and Saturdays. There are 42 stalls on 
 the market selling a wide diversity of
 goods. On Wednesdays these stalls are 
 used for traders of second hand goods 
 when the "flea market" operates.The   
 Friday and Saturday markets see an    
 abundance of vegetables and fresh     
 fruit alongside ladies'fashions,beads,
 hardware,childrens'clothes,bedding,   
 curtains,handbags,haberdashery,cheese,
 eggs and inexpensive beauty products. 
 One stall sells innumerable buttons.  
   Public toilets,a post office and    
 taxis are available to shoppers.
