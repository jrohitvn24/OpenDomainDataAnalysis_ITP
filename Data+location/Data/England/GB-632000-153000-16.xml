 Most residents belong to the Church of
 England, the next highest number are  
 Roman Catholics, then Non-Conformists.
 Residents of Finglesham and Burgess   
 Green attend Northbourne and those of 
 Worth and Hacklinge go to Worth Parish
 or Worth Free Church.                 
 Ham Church is redundant and Ham is    
 joined with Northbourne. Plans to     
 convert the church to a Stained Glass 
 Window factory are at a standstill.   
                                       
 Customs.                              
 The only custom observed is "Beating  
 the Bounds" at Finglesham. This takes 
 place five weeks after Easter on Roga-
 tion Sunday. It was originally        
 intended to help the younger folk to  
 memorize the Parish boundaries.
