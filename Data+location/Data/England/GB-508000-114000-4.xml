		<content> Each year in May the Dutch,bomb the   
 R.A.F. home in Storrington with       
 cheeses.They call themselves 'the Edam
 Busters'and this is their way of      
 saying "thank-you"for the food parcels
 dropped in Holland when it was        
 occupied by the Germans in the Second 
 World War.                            
 In early June a mammoth "Caledonion   
 Market" is held in the Recreation     
 Ground by Storrington Lion Club.All   
 proceeds from this sale of second hand
 furniture go towards helping the      
 community and especially old people in
 the area.                             
 On various Saturdays throughout the   
 summer,annual fetes ,barbecues and    
 barn dances are held by local groups.

 display  organized by the Round       
 Table,has become an annual event at
