		<title>08ST.MICHAEL'S CHURCH</title>
		<content> The main church in Thorpe is{St.      
{Michaels Church}which was built in an 
 Early English style.                  
 Since it was ori ginally built it has 
 been changed considerably.The tower   
 was rebuilt in the 18th  century,the  
 interior altered so that it could     
 seat about 100 people in 1874 and the 
 outside was rebuilt in 1912.          
 Since being altered the tower has     
 changed it's position,the window in   
 the north side has got smaller,and the
 original main door has been blocked up
 and a new one put in at the bottom of 
 the tower.                            
 The tower originally contained a clock
 and two bells but a third was         
 donated in the early 1900's by the Rev
 T.Hedley.                             
 The church also has a small graveyard 
 outside the main building.
