		<content> Reverend John Smith is the rector of  
 St. Edmund's Church, St. Leonard's    
 Church in Beaumont-cum-Moze, and      
 St.Mary's Church in Little Bentley.   
 In the church at Tendring, there is   
 some thirteenth century stained glass 
 which they are very proud of,as it is 
 priceless. The church has a font which
 was probably built in Henry VIII      
 reign. The church has a peel of six   
 bells, so they have to limit the      
 number of chimes they play. The church
 was very fortunate to be bought a new 
 set of choir robes by a lady who died.
 The Schubertians are a choral group   
 who visit every June from the         
 university of California.Carl Zytowski
 is the leader of the group, and is a  
 tenor.The men are supllied with bed   
 and breakfast by the villagers.
