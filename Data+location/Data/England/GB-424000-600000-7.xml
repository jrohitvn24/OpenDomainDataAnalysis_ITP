		<title>07THE PRECINCT AT HADSTON</title>
		<content> Our precinct at Hadston is fairly     
 big,it has many shops which consist of
 a co-op,hairdressing salon,fish and   
 chip shop,betting office,newsagent    
 clothes shop greengrocer,baker,a shop 
 for the hire of video films,butcher,  
 and a post office.                    
 Above the precinct there are flats    
 which house many people.There is alsoa
 car park for those people who live in 
 the flats and for the shoppers.This   
 car park is usually busy because the  
 parking is free.                      
 Although the precinct is very useful  
 for a small community like Hadston,it 
 could be kept tidier.The public       
 conveniences are covered in graffiti  
 and are very unhygenic.               
 Attached to the precinct there is a   
 community centre which is used for    
 different activities and sports e.g.  
 playschool,judo,keepfit and dancing.  </content>
