		<title>01An Overview of the area</title>
		<content>  Our area is mainly rural. It contains
parts of four villages - Walmer Bridge,
Longton, Hesketh Bank, Much Hoole, but 
most of the land is used for farming.  
The main form of farming is market     
gardening.                             
  The central part of the area is taken
up by marshland.The River Douglas runs 
south to north in our area and runs    
into the River Ribble. Our area as a   
whole is very flat.                    
  There is some new industry but this  
is very light and most of the          
population commute to work in Preston  
or Leyland. The population has         
increased over recent years due to the 
construction of new housing            
developments.                          
  Our area lies near the main A59 road 
joining Preston to Liverpool and       
Southport. There used to be a railway  
line but this was closed in 1964.      </content>
