For British Bulldog we stand at one    
end of the playground and the person   
who is on chooses someone to run to    
the other side of the playground. If   
he tigs him, he is on with him. The    
second person picks someone to         
run.This time you have to hold on to   
the person and say "One, two three     
British Bulldog." If he isn't caught   
all the other people try to run to the 
other side and back. When someone is   
caught the number to hold them         
increases up to ten, then it is "hold" 
until it is ten all round. When        
everyone is caught the first one who   
was caught starts the next game.       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
