		<title>15TRANSPORT in WELWYN G.C.</title>
		<content>{Cars}and light vans provide a large   
 part of the transport but{buses,taxis,
{bicycles}and{trains}are also used.    
 Nearly  70% of local residents own a  
 car and most claim it to be medium or 
 large. Most are powered by petrol.    
 A small number use more than one car. 
 Car owners use the car for nearly all 
 journeys.                             
 Many people questioned use the buses  
 but think the service not very good.  
 Taxis are not frequently used by those
 we asked but most think the service is
 important.                            
 Only a few use the trains often but   
 about half use them sometimes.        
 A significant number, mainly the      
 younger ones, use bicycles.           
 Local travel is often{on foot.}
