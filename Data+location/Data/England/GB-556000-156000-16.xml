		<content>       Seal St.Lawrence is a small     
 parish bordering Ightham and includes 
 Seal Chart.                           
       The earliest historical record  
 mentioning Seal Chart now lies in The 
 British Museum. It is a Royal Charter 
 dated 822, containing a reference to  
 "Cymesingas Cert" - i.e. Kemsing      
 Chart.                                
       St Lawrence has little to offer 
 in the way of "Romantic" history. It  
 possess no ancient church, no old     
 fortifications or mediaeval dwelling  
 house nd it has not offered a home for
 one of the Kentish families which have
 become famous in England's history.   
       There is an ancient road. It is 
 called The Old Roman Road from        
 Maidstone to Sevenoaks.               
       Some interesting places in the  
 area are Chart Farm and Stonepits     
 Manor.                                </content>
