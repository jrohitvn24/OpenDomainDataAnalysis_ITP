		<title>15St.Peter's Ch.Monkwearmouth.</title>
		<content> Monkwearmouth got its name because the
 land belonged to the monks of the     
 monastery at Jarrow.South of the river
 was called Bishopwearmouth,the land   
 belonging to the Bishop of            
 Durham.In 674 AD. a church and        
 monastery were built at Monkwearmouth 
 by St.Benedict Biscop.The west wall   
 and tower of the present church are   
 those built over 1300 years ago.The   
 Venerable Bede spent part of his life 
 here-entering the monastery at the age
 of 7 in the year 681 AD.He was a monk 
 here until he moved to St.Paul's      
 Monastery at Jarrow.                  
 On the 19th.March 1984,an unwelcome   
 visitor set fire to the church and    
 caused damage at over a quarter of a  
 million pounds.Restoration will take  
 many years to complete.
