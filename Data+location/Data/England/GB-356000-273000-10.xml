		<title>10OPEN CAST MINING _ KNOWBURY</title>
		<content>     In 1984,{Open Cast Coal Mining}was
 carried out on a large sloping field  
 belonging to a farm near Knowbury. The
 project would involve removing 20,000 
 tons of colliery spoil by lorry to a  
 West Midland site. The Knowbury site  
 would then be levelled and used for   
 sheep grazing. The contractors said no
 lorries would go through the village, 
 and they would be careful not to be a 
 nuisance.                             
     When they started to remove top   
 soil, people started to complain and  
 protest. Knowbury Parish Councillors  
 said they would do everything to      
 prevent it. In 1985, the contractors  
 had removed soil from a footpath, and 
 they were given an order to appear    
 before Ludlow Magistrates Court.      
     In June 1985, no work was being   
 carried out. The site looks barren.   
 There are piles of coal and no turf.  </content>
