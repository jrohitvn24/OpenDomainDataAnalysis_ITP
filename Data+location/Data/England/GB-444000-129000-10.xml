		<content> The{Jobcentre}offers jobs mainly in   
 offices, shops and catering. There    
 are some other careers on offer.Some  
 people have unrealistic ideas so they 
 don't easily get jobs. The people who 
 come in are aged from 18-60,the       
 majority being about 20 years old.    
 If the people cannot get{employment   
 they may come in every day. In June   
 1985 there were 250 jobs vacant. Most 
 of the jobs are in Winchester city    
 centre, but some are in surrounding   
 areas.                                
 The {Gas Showroom }used by 250-450    
 customers per week is busiest on      
 Monday, Friday, Saturday. Most popular
