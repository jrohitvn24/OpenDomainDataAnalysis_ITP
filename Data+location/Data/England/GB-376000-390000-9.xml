		<title>09Attitudes to Life in Sale</title>
		<content> A questionnaire answered mainly by 2nd
 years but also covering other age     
 groups showed a majority thinking that
 Sale is a goog place to live because  
 it has: good public transport, is near
 motorways, easy access to Manchester, 
 relatively unspoilt residential area, 
 clean air. But concern shown over:    
 amount of crime(burglary &amp; vandalism),
 high population density, heavy traffic
 &amp; parking problems, overspill estate. 
 Half of those over 30 thought that    
 Sale is worse now than 10-20 years ago
 (more women than men) because of: more
 noise, litter, vandalism, drug abuse, 
 poorer shopping facilities, fewer     
 cinemas. Most approved of the new     
 facilities (Leisure Centre, pedestrian
 area, Water Park)but shopping precinct
 was criticised as: lacking essential  
 shops, compares badly with Altrincham 
 and Stretford, attracting youths.     </content>
