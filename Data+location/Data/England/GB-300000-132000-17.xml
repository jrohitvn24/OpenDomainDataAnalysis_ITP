		<content> The artist and his wife live in what  
 used to be the miner's supervisors    
 cottage and they have extended this.  
 When they moved in three years ago it 
 was semi converted and they have      
 completed this but have retained the  
 original exterior appearance.         
 He used to be a producton engineer for
 Clark's shoes at Street before taking 
 up painting full time.                
 He paints in both water colour and    
 oils, mostly ladscapes, some of which 
 are for comission. He also does a     
 number of pen and ink drawings of     
 buildings which are used by hotels,   
 businesses and guest houses as designs
 on brochures, menus and napkins.      
 The oil paintings he sells for around 
 Â£50, although a lot depends on the    
 size and type of frame used.
