		<title>07A MENDIP SHEEP FARMER</title>
		<content> One farmer rears sheep on the remote  
 mendip plateau.He does not have a set 
 pattern for 5 days a week.His job is  
 very seasonal.Basically he works while
 its light.From November to February he
 will usually start work at 8.30 and   
 finish at 5.00.In summer he usually   
 gets up early.But one of the          
 advantages is that he can plan his own
 day.                                  
 Lambing in February is his busiest    
 time,and heavy snow can cause         
 additional problems.He has been cut   
 off by drifts.Much of his land is     
 rocky with thin soils,not suitable for
 crops.                                
 One of his favourite hobbies is flying
 his microlight.He flies this at       
 weekends.
