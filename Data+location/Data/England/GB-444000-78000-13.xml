		<content> The inland area of this part of the   
 Isle of Wight is mostly designated to 
 farmland.Some are old established     
 family farms,others are owned by      
 farmers from other parts of the       
 island.Over fifty years ago the fields
 were smaller and divided by hedges.The
 farming was mixed farming.Today there 
 is predominantly arable farming.The   
 most popular crops being wheat,barley 
 and potatoes.There are some dairy and 
 beef herds and some farms have small  
 flocks of sheep.Some farms use the    
 fertilised grassland for silage or    
 hay.The farmers use modern machinery  
 and fertilisers including aerial      
 spraying.People living in the area    
 were concerned about pollution.We     
 received no information to indicate   
 that the farmers were using computers 
 or new technology as an aid to farm   
 management.                           </content>
