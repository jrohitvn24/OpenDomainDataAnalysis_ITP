		<title>11A MILLIONAIRE'S LIFE STYLE</title>
		<content>  Mr Abad is an Egyptian millionaire.  
 He owns Pegglesworth farm which is 800
 acres. He has two swimming pools, one 
 for himself and one for his horses to 
 exercise them.                        
  He has a polo ground and two days    
 before we visited his farm he had had 
 the king of Jordan's brother come to  
 play polo with ten body guards.       
  Mr Abad is only at the farm for two  
 or three months of the year and       
 someone else is paid by him to manage 
 the farm for him. The manager's name  
 is Mr A'Barr. The manager lives       
 on the farm and has two children.     
  Mr Abad's house is very nice and he  
 has a silk bedroom where every bit of 
 material is silk.                     
  The manager employs only three       
 people for the farm, two men and one  
 woman but ten grooms are employed to  
 look after the 44 horses.             </content>
