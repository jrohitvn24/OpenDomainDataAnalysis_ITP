		<title>17Our Visit to Mr Mann</title>
		<content> We went to interview Mr Mann at the   
{post office.}Mr Mann has lived in     
 Stanton all his life, and he is 72 and
 a half now. He used to sleep in the   
 same room, but he has moved into the  
 other bedroom. When Mr Mann was 2 and 
 a half, the post office was built. Mrs
 Mann got 5 shillings a week as{salary 
 for running the post office. Mr Mann  
 had about 1 shilling a month, as      
{pocket money.}Mr Mann worked in the   
 church nearly seventy years ago. His  
 uncle was verger at the{church}and he 
 had to have special permission from   
 the rector's wife to sit in the pews. 
 His job was chopping wood for the     
 county council. Court Gardens weren't 
 there. The people in the Manor and    
 farmers were the only ones with cars. 
{The school}has improved, it was just  
 Mrs Banks' room, but an extension was 
 built in 1954.                        </content>
