		<title>04THE AERODROME</title>
		<content>                                       
   In 1940 the old aerodrome was used  
 as an airforce base.It is on the      
 outskirts of Scorton village.Fighter  
 planes based there were used in night 
 raids to prevent German aircraft from 
 bombing Teesside and Catterick        
 Garrison.The planes stationed at the  
 aerodrome were Beaufighters.These had 
 twin engines and were armed with two  
 cannons and eight machine guns.       
   In and around Scorton there are six 
 smaller sites.Some,near the aerodrome,
 were places for repairing aircraft and
 machinery.Some sites were where the   
 airmen lived.On the site next to our  
 school there was an Officers' Mess,a  
 Sergeants' Mess,a decontamination     
 centre and a gymnasium.The concrete   
 bases of the huts are still there, and
 the gymnasium is used by the Grammar  
 School boys.                          </content>
