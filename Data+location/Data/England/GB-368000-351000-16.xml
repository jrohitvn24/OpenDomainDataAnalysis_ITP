		<title>16FARMING</title>
		<content>    Farming in the area is mainly      
 arable and dairy although some farms  
 are mixed.There are at least two      
 poultry farms as well.The most common 
 animals kept in the area are cattle.  
 These are Friesian cows for milk and  
 Hereford crosses for beef, although   
 some continental breeds are being     
 introduced for beef such as Charolais.
    The main crops are grass, cereals ,
 particuarly barley ,and some potatoes.
 Most of the grass is turned into      
 silage but some is made into hay.     
    Common jobs a farmer does may      
 include manure or slurry spreading,   
 hay making, shed cleaning, milking,   
 making silage and crop sowing and     
 harvesting. Many farmers hire         
 agricultural contractors to do jobs   
 involving expensive machinery such as 
 harvesting,hedge-cutting and ditching.
