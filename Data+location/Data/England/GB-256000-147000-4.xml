		<content> To the NE of C.M. Beach the National  
 Trust Coast Path runs from Lester     
 Point, along Lester Cliff and above   
 Wild Pear Beach which is accessible by
 a steep zig-zag path.                 
      The cliff path leads up and over 
 Little Hangman hill which is an       
 outstanding geological feature of the 
 area giving it's name to a type of    
 sandstone known as Hangman Grits.     
      The path continues above         
 Blackstone beach to Great Hangman.    
 Here iron,copper and manganese were   
 formerly mined and laver (edible      
 seaweed) was gathered on the beaches. 
      This is a conservation area  of  
 great beauty within the confines of   
 the Exmoor National Park and has fine 
 coastal views.  Over 100 different    
 grasses and wild flowers are to be    
 found here including the rare Marsh   
 Orchid.                               </content>
