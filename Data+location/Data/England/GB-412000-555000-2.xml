		<content>    Derwent Cote farm is situated on   
 the south side of the River Derwent at
 the bottom of Medomsley Longclose Bank
 on the A694. The farmhouse was built  
 in 1876 but there have been other     
 farms there previously.The present    
 farm is owned by the National Coal    
 Board. It is 62 acres, slightly       
 smaller than the average for the area,
 which is usually about 90 to 100acres.
    There are lambs,hens, geese, young 
 beast to rear,horses,which include a  
 mare and foal, and 4 goats, one of    
 which is a milking goat. The young    
 beast are brought in in the autumn and
 sold in the early summer.             
    Some crops are grown, such as corn,
 hay, sometimes barley and potatoes.   
 The hay is baled. The bales are small,
 oblong and weigh roughly 4 stones or  
 25 kilos. Hay is used to feed the     
 animals, mainly horses.               </content>
