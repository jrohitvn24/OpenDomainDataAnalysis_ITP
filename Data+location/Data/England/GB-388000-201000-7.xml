 There are several factories in the    
 Chalford Vale.There is one which makes
 handcrafted furniture and has made    
 chairs for the strongest man in Europe
 and the fattest Member of Parliament. 
 In Chalford Hill there is the head    
 office of an engineering company.There
 are also several building companies   
 which employ small numbers of local   
 workers.In the valley there is a small
 industrial estate.There are also      
 several small garages which repair    
 vehicles,one of them sells petrol as  
 well.This is not an area that provides
 much employment so most people travel 
 to work in the towns and cities beyond
 Chalford,like Gloucester and Stroud.  
 This area is within reasonable reach  
 of all the main towns in the          
 South-West,some people even commute   
 to London by train from Stroud.       </content>
