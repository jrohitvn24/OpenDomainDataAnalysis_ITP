		<title>14ST.James's Church</title>
		<content> The building of St.James began in     
 1350 and was completed 90 years later.
 The spire was added to the church by  
 1515,it was built by 80 masons working
 for 5d a day.The tower is 290 feet    
 high and has 130 steps leading to the 
 spire.From here on a clear day you can
 see for about 13 miles in any         
 direction.The church is built from    
 limestone from Stratford upon         
 Avon.None of the stained glass windows
 are original,having been replaced in  
 the last hundred years.The eight bells
 in the tower weigh in at ten tonnes.To
 date there have been 45 vicars at St. 
 James.The current vicar Reverand Owen 
 has been there for 6 years and gets   
 about 160 people in his congregation  
 on a Sunday.
