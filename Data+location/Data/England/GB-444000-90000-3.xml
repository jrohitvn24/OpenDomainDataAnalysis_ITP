		<title>03PARKHURST FOREST.</title>
		<content> In Parkhurst Forest there are mostly  
 oak trees.We saw a plantation of young
 oaks they were about 1 metre high and 
 they were growing inside plastic      
 tubes to protect the trunks from      
 rabbits and squirrels. There was      
 another plantation of Norway spruce   
 (Christmas trees).There is a wide     
 track leading from Hillis Gate.People 
 go horse riding along there.You must  
 have a 'pass' if you want to ride on  
 the forest tracks.There are always    
 some trees being cut down_mostly tall 
 pine trees about 50 years old.They are
 used for fence posts.
