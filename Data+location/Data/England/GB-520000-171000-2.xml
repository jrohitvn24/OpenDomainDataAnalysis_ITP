downstairs and breakfast on Coco Pops  
and a cup of milk.8.30 set off for     
school and my mother goes off to work. 
I go straight into church where the    
service is taken by the Vicar.Then we  
have Maths. After play we have rounders
at the playing field.12 noon, sunny and
dry so we play on the grassy common.My 
favourite game is 40/40 where one      
person is on 'it' and the rest have to 
get to the solid object before the     
person on it sees them coming.1.00,    
eat my packed lunch in the hall.After  
2 more lessons school finishes at 4.00,
I am collected by my au pair.After     
homework,tea and reading comics, my    
mother comes home around 6.30. I make  
her a whisky and soda. We watch        
television and eat dinner.8.50 I get   
ready for bed.9.15 after saying prayers
I turn out the light. Clarissa,aged 10.</content>
