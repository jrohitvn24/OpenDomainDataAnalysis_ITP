		<title>19Activities for young people.</title>
		<content> There are a number of organisations in
 Hemyock which are especially to       
 provide leisure activities for young  
 people in and around the village. The 
 1st. Hemyock Scouts is the largest    
 rural troop in the country at the     
 present time. Much of its success is  
 due to the energy and dedication of   
 its leader, Mr.C.R.Loman. The scout   
 group is fed by two cub-scout packs - 
 "Valley" and "Blackdown". Similarly   
 for girls there is a Guide troop, The 
 1st. Hemyock, fed by two Brownie-Guide
 groups. Two groups for young people   
 are run by churches. They are the     
 Baptist Junior Club and the Parish    
 Church "Explorers". This summer a     
 youth club has been formed in Hemyock 
 at the request of a group of          
 teenagers. There is a strong branch of
 the Young Farmers movement, the       
 beginnings of which were at Hemyock.  </content>
