 for a while and watched{television.   
 Then{Dad}came in.He asked if I would  
 like to help him{work}on the house.I  
 said,"yes please,"and went outside to 
 see what{Dad}wanted me to do.He gave  
 me a{wire brush}and some{sandpaper.Dad
 told me to prepare the front gates for
 painting.I had to get the gates really
 smooth and make sure I rubbed all the 
 flaking paint off before I could{paint
{them.Mum}was at work so I made dinner.

{oven.It took five minutes.As soon as I
{had finished dinner I started painting
{the gates.It took me until tea time.
