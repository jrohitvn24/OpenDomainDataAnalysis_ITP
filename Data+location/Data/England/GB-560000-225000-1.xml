		<title>01INTRODUCTION TO GT EASTON</title>
		<content> In our 12 square km, most of the area 
 is arable farmland with a few small   
 herds of cattle.The land is made up of
 heavy fertile soil, overlaying London 
 clay, making it hard to drain and     
 there are many springs.There are 2    
 villages.The main one is Great        
 Easton.This has a very old church     
 which was built in 983.There is a     
 primary school to which most local    
 children go.Although the villages     
 are small the roads are fairly busy.  
 There are only a few business's in Gt.
 Easton and they are quite small.Most  
 of the population live here and in the
 smaller village of Duton Hill.Nearby  
 at Tilty is another very old church   
 which used to be at the gates of a    
 great Abbey where the common villagers
 could worship God.Now there is just   
 the church,Abbey ruins and one house.
