		<content> As a result of a questionnaire, the   
 following conclusions have been       
 reached.                              
 1.UNDER 10s. They are mostly English, 
 living in owner-occupied detached or  
 semi-detached houses with 4 bedrooms  
 and 2 bathrooms. Most participate in  
 sports at school and read comics. They
 frequently visit libraries and less   
 often cinemas. Churches, concerts,    
 theatres and sporting events are      
 rarely attended. The majority had a   
 2-week holiday last year in Britain.

 owner-occupied detached houses with
