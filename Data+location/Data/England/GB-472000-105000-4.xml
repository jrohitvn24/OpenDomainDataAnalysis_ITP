		<title>04A COUNCILLOR IN WARBLINGTON</title>
		<content>   The typical day starts at 7:30am    
 with the early post.Councillor Ralph  
 Cousins receives the agenda for the   
 evening's Council meeting.            
   At 9:30 Ralph Cousins has a         
 phone call from a lady complaining    
 about overgrown trees making the      
 footpath difficult to use,especially  
 mothers with prams.So Ralph takes an  
 instant photograph of the footpath and
 requests the Parks Department to      
 clear away the offending trees.       
   At 11:00am,there's another phone    
 call from a lady who has problems in  
 getting her car into her driveway     
 because of parked cars.Also,at        
 night,heavy lorries pass her house.   
 After contacting the Council Road     
 Traffic Engineer,they arranged to meet
 the local residents and discuss their 
 problems.After a long day,Ralph goes  
 home to relax!!!                      </content>
