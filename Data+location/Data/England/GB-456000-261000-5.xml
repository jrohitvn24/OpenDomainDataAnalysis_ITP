		<title>05Football and Netball in Dav.</title>
		<content> Daventry has it's own Netball league, 
at the time of the survey it had 14    
playing teams.The majority of the teams
are Daventry based, although several   
come in from the outlying villages.    
There are no players from Daventry who 
regularly represent the county, the    
travelling to suitable training        
prevents this.                         
 There are several local Football      
leagues and Games are played Saturdays 
and Sundays. There is also             
a Wednesday evening floodlit league at 
the Grange Sports Centre.              
 People who wish to play Hockey are    
disadvantaged through lack of          
facilities, men have to travel to      
Northampton (17 miles) and the nearest 
women's club is in Long Buckby some six
miles away.
