		<content> At 1.00 we go back into school. On    
 Monday afternoon we have apparatus, so
 all the people in my class get changed
 into their P.E kit (shorts and a      
 t-shirt). When we get back from P.E   
 it's about 2.00, so there isn't much  
 time until school ends at 3.00. We    
 finish off little bits of work until  
 2.30. At 2.30 we sometimes have a     
 story. The one we are reading at the  
 moment is called "The Hobbit". At 3.00
 it is time to go home. We go into the 
 hall and when we are all ready we lead
 out to the coaches. I usually get home
 at about 3.20. I change my clothes and
 go and play with my friends. At 6.00  
 my dad comes home from work and we all
 sit down for tea. After tea I         
 sometimes go outside and play but I   
 usually stay indoors and watch T.V. At
 9.00 I go to bed, and that is what    
 Monday is like for me.                </content>
