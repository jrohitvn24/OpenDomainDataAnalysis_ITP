		<content>{The area is mainly agricultural}with  
 intensive arable farming &amp; a few areas
 of woodland mainly around Tacolneston 
 Hall.Tacolneston provides the main    
 residential centre with scattered     
 housing in Fundenhall &amp; outlying farms
 Neither village has a centre.One B    
 class main road traverses the area.New
 Road links with the B1135 to Wymondham
 other roads being lanes with few hedge
 rows.The Norwich to New Buckenham bus 
 route runs along the main road.       
{Most residents work outside the area  
 but there are retired people &amp; a      
 number of family-run farms.They also  
 need to travel for most educational,  
 medical &amp; other social amenities. The 
 TV &amp; radio mast in New Road is a local
 landmark.                             
{The rural quiet is regularly broken}by
 noise of low-flying aircraft from the 
 many air bases in East Anglia.        </content>
