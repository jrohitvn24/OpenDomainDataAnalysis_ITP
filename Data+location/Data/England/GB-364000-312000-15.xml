		<content> The Apley Park estate is the newest   
{housing development}in the area.It is 
 a mixture of detached houses and      
 bungalows.Around the estate are lots  
 of small lanes;one that goes from the 
 estate to Leegomery used to be a      
 road.Nearby is the Blessed Robert     
 Johnson Catholic secondary{school     
 which is the only one in the          
 county.Next to the school is a{camp   
 for displaced persons;it was used to  
 house people who had fled from Eastern
 Europe during the Second World War.A  
 new{road}has been built to replace the
 old Whitchurch Road.It goes past the  
 new Telford hospital.At the top of the
 road is an old building which was the 
{lodge}house for Apley Castle.
