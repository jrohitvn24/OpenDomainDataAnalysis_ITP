		<content> There are six main hills and woods in 
 our area: these are Loders Hill,      
 Boarsbarrow Hill, Coneygar Hill,      
 Waddon Hill and Knowle Hill.The       
 nearest hill to us is Boarsbarrow Hill
 which has a wood on top.It contains   
 mainly pheasants but we have seen     
 buzzards,owls,rabbits,foxes,badgers,sq
 uirels and a few other rodents and    
 small birds.The biggest animal we saw 
 a roe deer. We tried to follow it     
 but we soon lost it.Right in the      
 centre of Boarsbarrow forest we found 
 a water turret. We discovered that    
 Boarsbarrow contains mainly Scots     
 Pine trees occasionally we saw oak or 
 ash trees. Close to the edge of the   
 forest we saw a young oak tree        
 that all the bark taken off by some   
 deer. One of the mian things          
 we found was a fungus called the      
 common stink horn or wood witch.      </content>
