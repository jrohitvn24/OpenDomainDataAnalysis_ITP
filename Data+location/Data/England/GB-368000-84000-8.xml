		<title>08INTERVIEW WITH SOME LOCALS</title>
		<content> ON THE 9TH JULY 1985,I INTERVIEWED    
 SOME{DINNER LADIES OF BROADWEY}       
{SCHOOL.}WHILST TALKING TO THEM I FOUND
 THAT THEY HAD BEEN  LIVING IN UPWEY   
 FOR MOST OF THEIR LIVES AND THAT A LOT
 OF THE SHOPPING FACILITIES HAD GONE.  
 INCLUDING A POST OFFICE,THE           
 BUTCHERS,THE GROCERS,AND THE PUBLIC   
 HOUSE CALLED THE ROYAL OAK.           
 A FINE EXAMPLE OF HOW THE USE OF      
 PREMISES HAS CHANGED IS A BUILDING IN 
 ELWELL STREET WHICH USED TO BE A      
 PROVISIONS SHOP,THEN IT WAS A FISH AND
 CHIP SHOP,THEN IT WAS A BARBERS SHOP  
 AND IS NOW A NORMAL RESIDENTIAL HOUSE.
 RECENTLY DORCHESTER ROAD HAS BEEN     
 WIDENED EXTENSIVELY TO IMPROVE        
 ACCESS ALL ALONG ITS LENGTH.          
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
