		<title>13THE ARKLE BECK by PETER</title>
		<content> The{Arkle beck}runs through this      
 area.It starts at the top of the dale 
 approximately 4 miles west of       { 
{Langthwaite village}and runs an       
 attractive course through             
 Arkengarthdale to join the River Swale
 at Reeth.                             
 The course of the beck has changed    
 over the years and the depth of water 
 varies . When the beck is in flood  it
 can be over 1 metre deep. Two places  
 where it is always very deep are      
 called Immy and Wyholm.               
 The beck runs through some attractive 
 woodland and a public{footpath}follows
 its course for much of the way.In     
 Langthwaite the beck is used to keep  
 ducks.                                
 The Lord of the Manor owns the{fishing
 rights but the beck is not stocked    
 with fish.In 1985 it costs Â£4_50 for  
 an adult fishing licence.             </content>
