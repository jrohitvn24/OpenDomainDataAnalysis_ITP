		<title>10    Shops in Silverton</title>
		<content>                                       
    The shops in Silverton include a   
 butcher, two general stores, a Post   
 Office, a newsagent, a garden shop, an
 art gallery, and a second hand shop.  
                                       
    We asked children to answer a      
 questionnaire on where their parents  
 shopped, what transport they used for 
 their shopping and if there were any  
 particular reasons for using these    
 shops.                                
                                       
    We found the most popular shop in  
 Silverton to be the Spar general      
 stores, and the least used  was       
 Bob's (second hand) shop.             
                                       
    When shopping out of the village we
 found that most people used cars,     
 rather than public transport.
