		<title>08ST.ANDREW'S CHURCH KEMBERTON</title>
		<content>  The church is dedicated to both      
 St.Andrew and St.John the Baptist.    
 Built on the site of several former   
 churches it was started in 1889. The  
 tower was added between 1906 and 1908.
  In the nave there are reproductions  
 of 15th century tiles which were found
 when the present church was being     
 built.They were made by Craven Dunhill
 of Jackfield and show hunting scenes. 
  There is a marble pulpit and a carved
 wooden communion table which dates    
 from the 18th century. The communion  
 vessels are 16th century.             
  The church has 4 bells dated 1596,   
 1621, 1671, 1753.About 2 years ago a  
 small band was formed to start ringing
 them again after an interval of 26    
 years.                                
  Two hand-written illuminated 'Books  
 Of Memory' contain the names of local 
 men who served in the First World War.</content>
