		<title>14ABBOT HOLME FARM</title>
		<content>      The farm is situated about a mile
 from the main Sedbergh to Dent road   
 over a very narrow bridge, so that a  
 portable milk tanker has to be taken  
 to the main road as it is impossible  
 for the milk to be collected from the 
 farm by a tanker.                     
      Members of the older generation  
 live with the farmer and his wife.    
 Caring for them involves more work and
 expense but they are quite happy about
 this as this is their way of living.  
      Hopes for the future include     
 items relevant to the security of     
 their farm:  good summers for         
 haymaking, mild winters so that the   
 animals can survive without a struggle
 and good health amongst the working   
 members of the family so that their   
 lifestyle may survive.  Although their
 lives require a lot of physical effort
 the rewards lie within the farm.      </content>
