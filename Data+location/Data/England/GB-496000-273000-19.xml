		<title>19The Ringstead Railway.</title>
		<content>                                       
The railway through Ringstead was      
opened on February 19th 1845.It was    
part of the network owned by the       
 North Western Railway.It ran from     
Northampton to Peterborough .The       
station was at the end of Station Road,
about one mile from the centre of the  
village,but as there were few coaches  
and nobody had cars the train was used 
by everybody who wanted to go anywhere.
 To make sure people were not late for 
the train the station master,who lived 
in a house by the station,rang a bell  
when the train was leaving Stanwick or 
Thrapston.The people would know they   
had to hurry from Ringstead,Addington  
or Woodford, for the station served    
all these villages. There were two     
platforms,a ticket office and a waiting
room.There was also a level crossing.
