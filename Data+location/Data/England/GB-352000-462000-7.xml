		<title>07CATON ST.PAUL'S C.E. CHURCH</title>
		<content>The main church in the area is the     
Parish church of Caton St.Paul's,which 
stands in Brookhouse at the top of the 
village. A church existed here as early
as the reign of Henry III 1216-1272.   
The church was rebuilt or extended in  
1537. In the 19th century it was in    
such a state of disrepair it had to be 
taken down (all except the tower) and  
rebuilt at a cost of 3000 pounds. The  
new church was consecrated and given   
the name of Caton St. Paul's in 1865.  
An old doorway with a Norman arch,a    
relic of the 12th century building,has 
been built into the West wall of the   
church near the tower.The current vicar
is the Reverend J.Tate.                
Until 1969 St.Paul's had a "daughter"  
church in Littledale,St.Mary's.This    
chapel doubled as a school when the    
children couldn't reach St. Paul's in  
wintry weather.                        </content>
