		<title>14PUPILS' SMOKING HABITS contd</title>
		<content>The average age for starting to smoke  
was 12 years.Five pupils smoked since  
they were 7, one since 8 and six since 
9 years old, representing 9.8% of all  
pupils smoking by 10th birthday.32.8%  
smokers said their habit damaged their 
sporting ability.92.7% of all pupils   
said they were aware of the health     
risks in smoking.47.2% of fathers of   
all pupils smoked and 40.7% of         
mothers.Parents who smoke have slightly
higher chance of having childeren who  
smoke.Most non-smokers said the legal  
age for buying cigarettes should be    
raised to at least 18 years.Most       
smokers wanted it to be about their    
current age.From this information three
causes for concern stand out:the very  
young age at which many start smoking;2
that as many girls smoke as boys;3.More
young people smoke than their parents.
