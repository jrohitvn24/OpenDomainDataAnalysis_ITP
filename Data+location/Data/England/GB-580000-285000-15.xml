		<content> The forest is a good habitat for      
 specialist birds such as the          
 Crossbill. Jays and Tits are common,  
 Woodlarks and Red Backed Shrike have  
 been recorded. The river has Coots,   
 Moorhens, Grebe, Canada Geese etc. and
 fringe birds such as Linnets, Wagtails
 and Warblers. Although basically in   
 reserves the Stone Curlew can be      
 found. Game birds such as Pheasant and
 Red_legged Partridge use the cover and
 also Golden Pheasant which originally 
 escaped from Elveden. The rotting     
 debris in felled areas makes good     
 habitat for many spiders, other       
 insects and fungi. One fungus,        
 Peniophora Gigantea, is used by the   
 F.C. to treat stumps infected by      
 Fomes.
