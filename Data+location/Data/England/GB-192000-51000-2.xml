		<content>  This area maintains local traditions.
 There is a pantomime in St.Stephens   
 every year,and annually a Feast week  
 held in both St.Stephens and Coombe.  
 At these festivals a Carnival Queen is
 chosen after the local girls have been
 judged in a competition in which they 
 wear special costumes.A good costume  
 can cost upto three hundred pounds,but
 the winner gets money as a prize to   
 help pay for it.{Local News}The       
 typical newspaper stories about the   
 St.Stephens/Coombe area today are not 
 very exciting :little happens here    
 which is of national significance.    
 Most events are small and of interest 
 only locally. Typical news,coffee     
 mornings,appeals, bingo,Church info.  
 sport,gossip,adverts .Recently nearby 
 St.Dennis Church burnt down and made  
 national news,TV and newspapers.      
                                       </content>
