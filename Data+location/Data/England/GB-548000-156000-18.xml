		<title>18HOUSING 3 -OTFORD</title>
		<content>  Only a small part of Otford is       
 included in the area of the survey. In
 this area the houses range from small 
 late C19th terraced cottages to five  
 year old detached houses on a small   
 estate.                               
 In the post 1945 period most of the   
 housing expansions has been by private
 developers rather than by individual  
 in-filling or council building.       
 Further expansion is being resisted by
 the Otford Society (see page16) so as 
 to maintain the character of Otford.It
 is not expected that new housing will 
 be planned in this western area of the
 village in the foreseeable future.
