		<title>08HOUSING: CHERRY WILLINGHAM</title>
		<content>   In Cherry Willingham most people    
 live on estates. These homes are      
 usually either bungalows or detatched 
 houses. Houses in any street are      
 usually different in style although   
 overall there are not many different  
 types in the village. Most houses and 
 bungalows are of two/three bedrooms.  
 Most of the houses have been built    
 since the 1950's.                     
   In Reepham there are no real estates
 just a collection of houses and       
 bungalows arranged in streets. Many of
 the houses were built before the last 
 war and are quite large.              
   Both Cherry Willingham and Reepham  
 have Manor houses but neither is      
 particularly important today.         
    Development is taking place in both
 villages on a small scale although 300
 new houses are planned for Cherry     
 Willingham.                 M.CHAMBERS</content>
