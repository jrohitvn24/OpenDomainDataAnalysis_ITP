		<title>06BIRD SURVEY</title>
		<content>      We went out and stood on the     
 school field and counted how many     
 birds we saw in ten minutes.

 66 BIRDS.                             
      We did another survey of how many
 birds nests there were in the school  
 grounds.  There are 11 nests.         
 BLACKBIRD 1 PIGEON 1 THRUSH 1 HOUSE   
 MARTIN 2 LINNET 4 BLUE TIT 2. One of  
 the blue tits was in a nest box.      
      There were also a lot of nests   
 outside the school grounds.  The four 
 linnets nests were just outside the   
 main school doors but one of the nests
 had cold eggs in it because the birds 
 must have been frightened and left the
 nest.
