		<content> After the 1985{May Fayre,}children    
 wrote "I won a jelly on the tombola   
 and some sweets on hook-a-duck. I had 
 a ride on a pony and went on the      
 bouncing castle four times. I was also
 selling cakes and sweets which we had 
 made in school and we took Â£21" "I had
 a good time at the May Fayre. I had a 
 go on the{tombola}and won some        
 Pomagne." "There was a{tin-can-alley.}
 One of our dad's put tins on top of   
 each other in a pattern, then we had  
 to try to knock them down with three  
 beanbags. If you did it you got your  
 money back." "There were two Police   
 cars and an ambulance to look at and  
 have a go on their sirens and         
 loudspeakers. There was a wedding in  
 Church and people were wondering if   
 some disaster had taken place because 
 of the noise!"{Children}ran a stall to
 guess the number of sweets in a jar.  </content>
