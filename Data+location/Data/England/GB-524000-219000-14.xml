		<title>14Knebworth Doctors Surgery.</title>
		<content> The doctors' surgery was modernised in
 1982. There are 7 doctors in the      
 practice and they look after 14,000   
 patients. It is usual to make an      
 appointment to visit the doctor. There
 are two consultation periods each day.
 The doctors work on a rota system so  
 that they have a day off during the   
 week. The surgery is in a converted   
 house and so the consulting rooms are 
 on different floors in the house.     
                                       
 If a patient needs some medicines they
 are given a prescription by the       
 doctor. The patient then takes the    
 prescription to one of the two        
 chemists shops in London Road.
