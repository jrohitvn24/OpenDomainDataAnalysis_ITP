		<title>12Housing in Aust</title>
		<content> Most of Aust village is cut off from  
 the River Severn by the carriageway   
 which leads to the Severn Road        
 Bridge.Aust is a pretty village with a
 variety of well kept houses.There are 
 detached,semi-detatched and terraced  
 houses and a number of cottages and   
 bungalows. Some of the houses only    
 have one bedroom, others have as many 
 as six. We came across a rank of small
 old houses which seemed to be for     
 senior citizens. Some houses appeared 
 very old, others much newer or at     
 least modernised. All the houses had  
 gardens which looked very attractive. 
 We also saw some farm houses.         
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
