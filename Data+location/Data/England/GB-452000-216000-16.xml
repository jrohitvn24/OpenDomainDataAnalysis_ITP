		<title>16Garage Services near Weston</title>
		<content> The presence of the main A43 road has 
 attracted several garages, filling    
 stations and cafes to the Weston area.
 All favour extending the M40 as they  
 anticipate increased business.  All of
 them provide work for local people.   
                                       
 The Lay-by Garage and Transport Cafe  
 is visited each day by some 200 HGV   
 drivers calling for food of whom 10%  
 buy fuel. It is the only transport    
 cafe on the road between Northampton  
 and Southampton.  The garage also     
 sells petrol and does accident repairs
 and local servicing.                  
                                       
 Weston Garage does local servicing,   
 repairs and MOTs. The nearby Rey Serv-
 ice Station opens daily to sell petrol
 to business and local people. The     
 Little Chef (nationwide chain) sells  
 snack meals to the motoring public.   </content>
