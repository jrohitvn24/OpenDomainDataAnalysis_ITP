		<title>12FARMING AROUND SLIMBRIDGE</title>
		<content>      Farming is by far the biggest    
 occupation in the area with cattle    
 outnumbering people by about three to 
 one!  However, there is arable as well
 as dairy farming.  Grass is grown for 
 silage which is kept and then fed to  
 the cattle during the following       
 winter.  Vegetables and fruit,        
 especially broad beans, strawberries  
 and apples are also widely grown      
 throughout the area.                  
      This all means that much of the  
 landscape is rough grazing and        
 cultivated fields particularly in the 
 south and south-west where there are  
 only about ten inhabitants per square 
 kilometre.                            
      The milk from the various farms  
 is collected every day and taken to   
 the Milk Marketing Board depot at     
 nearby Stonehouse.
