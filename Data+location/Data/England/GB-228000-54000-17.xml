		<content> The block and the main community is   
 divided into two parishes by the      
 ancient boundary of the Seaton        
 river.This boundary has existed since 
 medieval times when it separated the  
 'hundreds'.The boundary has little    
 relevance in 1985 but it will need a  
 massive groundswell of local opinion  
 to change it.The eastern section is   
 part of the large parish of{St.Germans
 western area in the small{St.Martins.}
  Irrational divisions also occur at   
 District and County level. Some       
 representation for change has been    
 made but distant councillors manage to
 veto local opinion. At parish level   
 the block is represented by 6 members,
 3 on each council.One District and one
 County Councillor represent most of   
 the block, only isolated farms are in 
 other divisions.All belong in the East
 Cornwall Parliamentary constituency.  </content>
