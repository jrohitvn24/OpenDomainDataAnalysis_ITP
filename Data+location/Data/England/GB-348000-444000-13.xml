		<title>13A DAY IN THE LIFE OF A CHILD</title>
		<content>I am Michael Costain. On Sunday I got  
up, dressed, had my  breakfast  then I 
went for the paper with Philip         
Lamoury. Then I played knock out       
cricket. We went to Mass at  Lancaster 
University at 11.30am. Then we went to 
 MR. Kelly's house to tune my guitar.  
We had dinner  then  we went  to  the  
playing  field  to  play  football. I  
cycled to Dominic Kelly's house to play
on our  bikes with  Clara Blunt.  After
tea we played football. Then I went on 
a bicycle ride with mum and dad. After 
a bath I read then went to sleep.      
I am Angela Curwen. I get up at        
7.00am. I make breakfast, watch T.V.,  
dress and go  to school 4 miles away.  
At school we say  prayers, read, do    
maths, watch T.V. and  learn           
English. After school I play out, have 
my tea watch Coronation Street and     
Brookside then go to bed.              </content>
