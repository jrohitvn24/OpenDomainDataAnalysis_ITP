		<content>      On Saturday 6th July, my         
 brother, my dad and I went to the     
{Braintree District Camp,}at{Shalford  
{Hall Farm.}My brother and I go to{1st 
{Finchingfield Foxes.                  
      We were split up into four sites 
 called Sub-camps. We were with{1st    
{Cressing}and{1st Felstead packs.}We   
 roasted a pig on a spit. We made      
 paper aeroplanes, whistles and plaster
 casts of leaves. We made rafts, raced 
 them, paddled and swam in the river   
{Pant.}There was a rope bridge and an  
 obstacle course. We played cricket,   
 football and rounders. We sang round a
 camp fire.                            
      We were all given a badge before 
 we left at about 5p.m. on Sunday.     
      The weather was very pleasant. We
 all enjoyed ourselves very much and I 
 look forward to next year's camp.
