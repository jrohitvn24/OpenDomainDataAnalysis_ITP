7.30 a.m. the alarm clock goes off.  I 
force myself out of bed and go down    
stairs.  I arrive at school at 8.30.   
and play football until 8.55. We go    
into assembly at 9.00.  During the     
morning we do Maths , English and      
Reading Laboratory.  At dinner         
time I have a packed lunch from 12.30  
to 1.25.  We play football in the      
playground.  1.25 we come in and do    
our project or R.I. until 3.45. we have
a playtime in between. Straight from   
school I go to my Nans where I watch   
television, have some biscuits and     
drink some coffee.  At 5.00 p.m. I walk
home to have some tea. After tea I go  
to the park to play football with my   
friend, and his Dad .  I come home     
and go to bed at 9. 30. p.m.
