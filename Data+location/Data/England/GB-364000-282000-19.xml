		<title>19A STOTTESDON FARMER'S DAY</title>
		<content>{My name is Robin.}I am 44. I farm a   
 tenanted farm of 315 acres, mixing    
 dairy, sheep and arable enterprises.  
   My day starts at 7.00am with the    
{milking}routine.After cleaning up &amp;   
 sterilising the equipment, I have     
 breakfast at 9.30-10.00,while opening 
 the post. After the milk has been     
 collected, the bulk tank has to be    
 cleaned &amp; the cows put out to grass.  
 Meanwhile my farmworker has walked the
 fields to check on the{sheep.}The rest
 of the morning is spent on{field or   
{stock work}in season, which continues 
 until the evening milking with a break
 for lunch(1.30-2.00pm).My evening meal
 can be any time between 7.00 &amp; 9.00pm.
 After that I might have some more     
 outside work to do, or{administrative 
{work.}I read the farming press,or doze
 in front of the TV, and go to bed at  
 about 11.30 pm. Except when lambing!  </content>
