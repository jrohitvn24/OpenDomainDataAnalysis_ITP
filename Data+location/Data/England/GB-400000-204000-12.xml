 house at Daglingworth is situated on  
 high ground overlooking Cirencester   
 about 4.5 kms from the centre of town.
  The mast is owned by the I.B.A and   
 pictures are sent up to 8kms in all   
 directions. It looks like a very tall 
 pylon with a vertical tube at the top.
 It was built in 1982 and is about 35m 
 tall.                                 
  The block contains 2 garages, both   
 are on the A435,Mosley's Garage sells 
 Pace petrol at 199.9p per gallon, they
 also sell Citroen cars.  Auto Garage  
 at Perrott's Brook sells Fina petrol  
 at 201.6p per gallon and also  repairs
 cars.                                 
  An estate of very expensive houses is
 hidden behind Mosley's garage. This   
 was a pre war development and is very 
 exclusive.                            
                                       </content>
