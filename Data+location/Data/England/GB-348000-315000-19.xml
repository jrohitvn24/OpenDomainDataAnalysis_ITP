		<content>   After we have finished the work we  
 mark them all together and then we get
 on with our work which usually        
 involves some work to do with our     
 theme for the term, over the past year
 we have been working on themes to do  
 with colour which included a visit to 
 Chester Zoo,a history project on      
 castles with a visit to The Tower of  
 London and we have been studying a    
 local area of woodland 'Grinsill' some
 os us have been on a weekend visit to 
 the City of York which we have enjoyed
 very much and have made books of our  
 own about the visit.As well as this   
 work some of us work in our maths     
 groups or science which we enjoy after
 break we usually change over with the 
 afternoons being art work, music or   
 drama or even games and P.E., if we   
 have a games period.
