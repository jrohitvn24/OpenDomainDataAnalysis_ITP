		<title>12PLAYGROUP AT KEMPSFORD</title>
		<content>  Formed in 1973, meeting three        
 mornings a week at{Kempsford Village  
{Hall}to provide safe, satisfying group
 play for up to 24 3 to 5 year olds,   
 the playgroup is self-sufficient. It  
 raises the money needed for rent,     
 heating, insurance, equipment and     
 staff pay from fees, donations and    
 activities. The attendance fee is 75  
 pence per session which also covers   
 1/3 pint of milk paid for by {Social  
{Services.}A Supervisor and her        
 assistant are paid, while mothers, on 
 a rota, provide voluntary support so  
 that there is a ratio of 1 adult to 6 
 children. This pre-school playgoup    
 successfully helps the child from the 
 small family unit to socialise and    
 develop potential within a larger     
 group as a stepping stone to school.
