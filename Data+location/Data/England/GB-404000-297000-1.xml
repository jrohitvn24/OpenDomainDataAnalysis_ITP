		<title>01Streetly and South Aldrige</title>
		<content> The area of Streetly is mainly        
 residential with private houses. There
 is a new private housing estate which 
 has been built on the site of the     
 Streetly Works in Aldridge Road. Up at
 Doe Bank Lane there are lots of farms.
 They are mostly used for grazing,     
 grassland and potatoes.  West of      
 this estate (Hundred Acre) is just    
 fields and grass. The highest point in
 our D block is Barr Beacon which has a
 green domed structure and a map. There
 is little industry, most people       
 travelling to Birmingham by bus or    
 car to work. At night the teenagers   
 hang around the shops in Boundary Road
 smoking cigarettes or ride their      
 motorbikes noisily around the estate.
