		<title>10     THE NESS COASTLINE</title>
		<content>   The Ness is quickly eroding and in  
1875 the Ness was much further out.    
   The water used to come right up     
into the bank by the Shaldon Bridge    
(which at the time was not built) but  
it was filled in to build St. Peter's  
Church.                                
   Smuggler's Tunnel was built by Lord 
Clifford for easy access to Ness Beach.
The steps are shallow so that a        
wheelchair could travel down it.       
   There was a proper smuggler's tunnel
by the gates that lead to Lord         
Clifford's private land.  This had pits
in it so that the treasure could be    
hidden in here and covered over with   
dirt.                                  
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
