		<content> _Many of the people who live in this  
 area also work here.Most work on      
 farms,but some work at country crafts 
 like basket making. In recent years a 
 few houses have been bought by people 
 who work outside the area but prefer  
 to live in the country.               
 There is very little building land in 
 the area so the population is not     
 expected to grow very much.           
 The sort of people who choose to live 
 here are often young people who want  
 their children to grow up in the      
 country or old people who have retired
 to the country after an active life   
 elsewhere.                            
 The local people can often trace their
 ancestry in the area back for several 
 generations.Many families are related 
 to each other.
