		<title>13Local History of Kingswood.</title>
		<content> Kingswood derives its name from the   
 Royal Forest or King's Wood which     
 covered much of southern England      
 before the reign of King Henry III.   
 During the{industrial revolution}the  
 area was extensively mined for coal.{ 
{William Champion,}a Quaker and        
 industrialist, built the first        
 commercial{zinc}plant in Europe in    
 Warmley in 1746. He built cottages for
 his workers with several shops and a  
 clocktower.In the mid 18th century the
{Cockroad Road gang}were a notorious   
 band of theives who dominated a hive  
 of criminal activity. Both{George     
{Whitfield and John Wesley}regularly   
 preached to the people of Kingswood,  
 and there is a symbolic beacon on     
 Hanham Mount in memory of preachers   
 who were persecuted and put to death.{
{Whitfield's Tabernacle}was built in   
 1741 during the{religious revival.    </content>
