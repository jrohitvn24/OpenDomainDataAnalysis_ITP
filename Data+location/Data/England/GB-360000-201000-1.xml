		<content>    Lydney with its surrounding        
 villages is situated between the      
 eastern edge of the Forest of Dean and
 the River Severn.Gloucester is        
 nineteen miles away and Chepstow ten. 
    From the time of the Armada and up 
 to Stuart times shipbuilding took     
 place at Lydney,but the silting of the
 river ended this and today the river  
 is a mile farther from the town.      
    Coal and iron mining nearby gave   
 the area a tinplate works and work to 
 the small docks,now used as a marina. 
    Early industries declined and new  
 ones took their place after the       
 1939-45 war although farming and      
 forestry are still important.Some of  
 these industries have gone in the last
 three years.1985 sees efforts to bring
 new work for the 14% unemployed to its
 industrial estate,the home of a large 
 plywood factory and other industry.   </content>
