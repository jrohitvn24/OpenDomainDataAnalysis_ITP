		<title>12THE POULTRY FARM</title>
		<content>  Mr.Timothy Wood has a poultry farm in
 S.Cheriton with 53,000 hens kept in   
 batteries. He has no male chicks. He  
 feeds them on high protein layer mash.
 The farm covers 5 acres and 4,000 eggs
 are laid daily. He sells over 20,000  
 eggs a week to local villages. He has 
 some vans of his own each van covering
 about 500 miles a week.               
  He does not export any of his        
 produce.Eggs that are cracked or not  
 quite perfect are liquified.          
  Mr.Wood has lived in this area 10    
 years and employs mostly local people 
 on a casual basis when he requires    
 extra staff.                          
  He says that the common market has   
 made no differences to his work. The  
 staff start work at 8.00 a.m.Only 4%  
 of eggs are cracked and 90% of eggs   
 produced are perfect.
