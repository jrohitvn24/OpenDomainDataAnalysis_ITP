		<title>16Transport in Whittlesey</title>
		<content>   The town is cut in half by a main   
 road the A605. This road has recently 
 been widened and straightened. It is  
 the main link between Whittlesey and  
 Peterborough. Many people work in the 
 city and live in Whittlesey resulting 
 in some congestion in the morning and 
 late afternoon. During the winter many
 minor accidents occur due to ice and  
 fog caused by the nearness of the road
 to a river.                           
   A local bus company runs a 20 minute
 service to Peterborough, the journey  
 takes about 35 minutes.  Other less   
 frequent services run to other nearby 
 towns and villages.                   
    A rail service runs to Peterborough
 and March 4 times daily.              
    Most families own or have use of a 
 car. Nearly all the people who live in
 Whittlesey have and use a bicycle for 
 going to work or shopping.            </content>
