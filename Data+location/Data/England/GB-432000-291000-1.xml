		<title>01Introducing the area</title>
		<content>  This area covers most of the North   
 West part of{Nuneaton.}Since it       
 excludes the main shopping area of the
 town it can be categorised into three 
 main parts: housing estates; farmland;
 and wasteland created largely by      
 disused pits. As this land becomes    
 stable enough the trend is to use it  
 and adjoining farmland for new private
 housing estates. The area is dissected
 by the{Coventry Canal, River Anker and
{London-Glasgow railway.}North of      
 Nuneaton town centre, rising out of   
 the{Trent Valley}is an outcrop of hard
 pre-Cumbria rock which has led to     
 large quarries being developed,       
 scarring the landscape. A large       
 council estate dominates the skyline  
 of the South facing slopes. In the    
 centre of this estate lies a lovely   
 natural pool which has been landscaped
 into a park.                          </content>
