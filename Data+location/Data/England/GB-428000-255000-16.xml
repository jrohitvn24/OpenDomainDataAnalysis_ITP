		<content> Ferreting. As the rabbit population   
 becomes more and more immune to       
 myxomatosis the need for controlling  
 their numbers has increased. Ferrets  
 are being used locally to drive the   
 rabbits from their burrows. In rural  
 communities the practise has always   
 continued but local ferret keepers    
 report an increase in demand for their
 services.                             
                                       
 Beekeeping. In Moreton Morrell, John  
 Taylor has been keeping bees for many 
 years. He is often called out by the  
 Police to collect swarms of bees that 
 are creating a nuisance.              
                                       
 Shooting contiues to be popular       
 especially with the younger men. They 
 shoot rabbits, crows and pigeons of   
 which the farmers are glad to be rid. 
 Clay pigeon shooting is also popular. </content>
