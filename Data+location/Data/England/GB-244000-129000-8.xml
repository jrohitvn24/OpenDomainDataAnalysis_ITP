		<content> In our area there are many facilities 
 for the use of tourists. There are 2  
 tennis clubs, a country park, a sports
 club, caravan and camping sites and   
 hotels, bed and breakfast houses      
 providing accomodation.               
                                       
 We asked the 200 children of the      
 school how many had parents working in
 these places and we found that 47 of  
 them worked on the holiday trade.     
                                       
 Of these, nearly half do not go away  
 for holidays because their parents    
 have to work when the school holidays 
 are on in the summer.                 
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
