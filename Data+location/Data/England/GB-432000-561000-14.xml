		<content> I am a skinhead.I have my hair cut    
 very short.I like my hair to be very  
 short because it is neat and tidy.I've
 got tattoos on my arms and hands.I    
 listen to music by The Toy Dolls,and  
 Angelic Upstarts.My best friend, Sean,
 influenced me to dress in rolled up   
 trousers and boots called Docs.I don't
 dress this way to frighten people.Most
 of my friends dress the same.People   
 stare and think we're going to cause  
 trouble.My family and girlfriend don't
 mind the way I dress.I used to work in
 the Community Industry,which was      
 painting and decorating,but now I'm on
 the dole like many other people.I try 
 to avoid fights if pssible,the people 
 I fight with mainly are Mods and      
 Posers.I have dressed this way for a  
 long time,and wo'nt dress any other   
 way.TERRANCE HUGHES(age17)
