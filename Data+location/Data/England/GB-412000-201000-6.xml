		<content>  {Palmer Hall}in London Street is a   
 single room village hall.  Built in   
 l937 to commemorate the Coronation of 
 George VI, it was given by Col.       
 Palmer, the biscuit magnate who was

 receptions, meetings, polling,        
 clinics, dances, plays, bazaars and   
 badminton.  The move of Farmor's      
 School to new buildings in the Park in

 project, the Centre accommodates the  
 Youth Club, Playgroup, citizens and
