		<content> A Change in Lifestyle from Town to    
 Country is described here by an 11    
 year old boy.                         
      I now live in Hemingbrough, but I
 used to live near Wakefield. Life in  
 the country is a lot different to life
 in the town, its not as fast, busy or 
 as noisy. The atmosphere is happier   
 and friendlier. The village is        
 presented nicer and there is no heavy 
 bustling traffic. The thing I like    
 best about this area is the people,   
 they are very friendly and welcoming. 
 When I moved to the area I was very   
 surprised to find no smelling fish and
 chip shops or roaring motorways. All  
 in all I think I prefer the country to
 the town.
