		<content> My name is James Dunning.I am 7 years 
 old.I live in Warmsworth              
 Doncaster.I live in a new four bedroom
 detached house. My house was built a  
 few years ago on some old farmers     
 fields that the farmer rented to grow 
 corn on.The land was Known as the corn
 fields.Before we moved to Balby       
 we lived in Hexthorpe.When we first   
 moved in there were only a couple of  
 houses.Now there are,198 new houses   
 built around my school.They were built
 by Mcleans Homes and Hallgate         
 Homes.The houses are detached and     
 semi detached and the bungalows are   
 all detached.The steets are all cul de
 sacs and the front gardens do not have
 walls and fences,they are open plan.  
 Now nearly all the houses are finished
 we have had 41 new children start our 
 school who live on the new estate.
