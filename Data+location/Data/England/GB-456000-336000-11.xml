		<title>11THE MAYOR</title>
		<content>    Today Mrs. Whiting, the Mayor of   
 Rushcliffe, came to visit us and told 
 us about the work of the Council. She 
 told us about the services that the   
 Council provides for us and how the   
 money that people pay in rates is     
 spent on things for the area.         
    She showed us the Mayoral Chain. It
 was on a black velvet collar and was  
 very heavy. At the bottom hangs the   
 coat of arms of Rushcliffe. It has a  
 picture of Trent Bridge on  it and at 
 the top is a cliff and some rushes.   
 Underneath is the motto, Salus Populi,
 which means the welfare of the people.
    Mrs. Whiting  told us that she     
 enjoyed visiting different people in  
 the area and found it very            
 interesting. Mrs. Whiting's daughter  
 is the Mayoress.                      
                                       
                                       </content>
