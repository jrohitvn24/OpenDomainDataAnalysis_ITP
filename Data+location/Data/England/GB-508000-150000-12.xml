		<content> This is a wealthy area where the      
 houses are in general large individual
 centrally heated and set in large     
 grounds.  Most households have 2 cars,
 the area lacking a large shopping     
 centre &amp; with minimal public trans-   
 port.  There is a small estate on the 
 main road built by the Council &amp; rent-
 ed to lower income families. There are
 flats over the shops in Bishopsmead   
 Parade &amp; sheltered housing for the    
 elderly nearby.  All the area is serv-
 ed by a postman &amp; an electric float   
 delivers milk daily.  Some owners of  
 the large houses are businessmen      
 working abroad who rent their houses  
 to people from other countries,       
 especially Americans, who are working 
 in England.  They are generally manag-
 ed by estate agents who collect rent, 
 organise repairs and arrange for the  
 upkeep of the house and garden.       </content>
