		<title>09Land usage of Beeley Moor</title>
		<content> Due to variations in land height and  
 soil fertility the type of farming may
 be classified as mixed farming. The   
 Hipper valley farmland consists of    
 grassland for silage and hay, enclosed
 rough grazing and moorland. Due to the
 steepness of the terain  few crops are
 grown. The farmland in the south east 
 of the area is worked in a similar way
 but in addition crops such as barley, 
 corn and potatoes are grown. Two farms
 have Friesian dairy herds and the milk
 is collected by tanker. Other farms   
 have cattle for beef and some have    
 small flocks of sheep, the commonest  
 breeds being Swaledale and Suffolk    
 mules.                                
{FARM MACHINERY:-}small machinery such 
 as tractors with harrows and ploughs  
 are used. Where large machinery is    
 needed, such as combine harvesters,   
 contractors are used.                 </content>
