		<content> The day after May Day the market      
 arrived and the town was busy. A group
 of Majorettes dressed in stripey      
 leotards paraded in Pocklington Market
 Place to tape recorded music.         
 The fair came on May 31st. The        
 speedway (Waltzers) was a fast ride it
 had nine cars on a platform which     
 rotated and each car went round       
 individually. There was another ride  
 with wooden replica motorcycles on a  
 platform that revolved. These rides   
 cost 25 pence. The "Hook a Duck" was a
 children's game where plastic ducks   
 floated on water and a small current  
 moved them round. The child held a    
 wooden rod with a hook on the end. If 
 they could hook a duck they got prize 
 which was a toy or a goldfish. On     
 Monday 6th May a fun run was held to  
 raise money for charity, they ran from
 Pocklington to Bishop Wilton and back.</content>
