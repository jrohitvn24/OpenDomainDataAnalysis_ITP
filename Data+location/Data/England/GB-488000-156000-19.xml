		<title>19The Army at Deepcut</title>
		<content>   The Royal Army Ordnance Corps (RAOC)
 headquarters is in Deepcut and it owns
 about 2 square kilometres of land in  
 the area. One half of the land has    
 houses for families and the other half
 has offices and the training ground.  
   The RAOC started in the Crimean War 
 and was called the Military Store     
 Department. In the Crimean War there  
 were not enough supplies so they      
 organised them.                       
   Our school is just to the east of   
 the married quarters and many of the  
 children have parents in the army but 
 some come from Deepcut village.       
   On Friday 17th May 1985 the RAOC    
 were given the freedom of the Borough 
 of Surrey Heath and all the children  
 in our school went to watch the       
 ceremony.
