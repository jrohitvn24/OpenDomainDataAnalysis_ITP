		<content>      As Market Weighton became        
 established as a market town, it      
 became important for local villages   
 and farmers.  There are 5 banks in the
 town: "T.S.B.", "Midland", "Barclays" 
 and "Lloyds".  All are widely used by 
 the local people.  The banks keep     
 normal banking hours and the "National
 Giro Bank" keeps Post Office hours.   
      There are also branches of the   
 following Building Societies:         
 "Nationwide", "Halifax", "Leicester"  
 and the "Bradford and Bingley".  The  
 "Halifax" is part of "Hornsey and     
 Sons", an estate agents and is used to
 arrange mortgages for house buyers.   
      Shiptonthorpe has no such        
 economic establishments as it is such 
 a small village, consisting largely of
 farms.  Its proximity to Market       
 Weighton is also a factor.
