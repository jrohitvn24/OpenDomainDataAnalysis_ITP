		<content>  IN DOBWALLS PEOPLE RARELY LOCK       
 BOTH THEIR DOORS. EVERYONE USED TO    
 KNOW EVERYONE ELSE,AND STILL TRIES TO.
 IT IS IN MANY WAYS A WARM AND         
 FRIENDLY, IF NOSY, PLACE TO LIVE. IT  
 IS ALSO VERY CONFORMIST. PEOPLE WHO   
 DIFFER IN IDEAS APPEARANCE OR         
 ASPIRATIONS ARE VERY NOTICEABLE. THAT 
 CAN MAKE IT AN UNCOMFORTABLE PLACE TO 
 BE.                                   
  THIS IS THE FIRST PLACE I HAVE LIVED 
 WHERE I AM A WOMAN FIRST AND A HUMAN  
 BEING SECOND. I AM REGARDED BY SOME AS
 AN ARDENT FEMINIST. I AM NOT.         
  I AM MOVING NEXT YEAR. THERE ARE     
 PEOPLE I WILL MISS GREATLY, AND THERE 
 IS GREAT PLEASURE TO BE HAD LIVING IN 
 AN AREA OF SUCH BEAUTY, BUT I LOOK    
 FORWARD TO MUCH GREATER FREEDOM AND   
 OPPORTUNITY, WHEN I LIVE IN LONDON.
