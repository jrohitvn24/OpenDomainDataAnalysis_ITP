		<title>05THE CHURCH - WINDOWS</title>
		<content>     The church has a number of        
 interesting stained glass windows.    
 These (like the pews) are mainly      
 Victorian. Two later windows are of   
 particular local interest. The earlier
 of the two is dedicated to the Rev.   
 Nunn who was vicar from 1850 to 1901. 
 He is the only ghost that is believed 
 to haunt West Pennard. He died peace- 
 fully and is said to be a friendly    
 ghost who looks after the village. His
 gravestone can be found by the church.
    There is one modern window given to
 the church in 1981 by the wife of a   
 man who had sung in the choir for 73  
 years. The picture shows Christ       
 teaching from a boat but the Tor can  
 clearly be seen in the background.    
    The main altar window suffered some
 damage in the last war when a bomb    
 fell nearby. The lower part of the    
 window was not replaced.              </content>
