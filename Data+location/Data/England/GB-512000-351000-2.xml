		<content> North Kyme was,at one time,part of the
 area owned by{Philip of Kyme}who was a
 sheriff of Lincolnshire in the twelfth
 century. This lasted until the reign  
 of Henry Vlll when the manor then     
 belonged to Earl Fitzwilliam who sold 
 it to various freeholders. It was at  
 the eastern edge of a low fen farming 
 area which was part of a great level  
 drainage scheme undertaken by the Earl
 of Lincoln in 1653.In 1793 a turnpike 
 road was built from Sleaford to       
 Tattershall which opened up the area. 
 A Wesleyan Chapel was built in 1848   
 and closed down in 1982.              
      The ancient cross in the centre  
 of the village known as the{Butter    
{Cross}was renovated in 1826 and was   
 originally used as a meeting place for
 local farmers and their wives to sit  
 and sell their produce.
