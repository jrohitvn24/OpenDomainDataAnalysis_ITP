		<title>03Councillor's report Salford</title>
		<content> Mr Pennington became a local Labour   
 Councillor because he wanted to serve 
 the people and felt that only the     
 Labour Party could create an equal and
 just society.  Councillors are        
 responsible for making decisions about
 how much money should be spent on     
 providing local services.  For example
 last year Â£56m was spent on education.
  Due to government cutbacks there is  
 not enough money in the kitty and so  
 the building of a sports and          
 recreation centre next to our school  
 will have to be postponed yet again.  
 The redevelopment of Little Hulton as 
 a Salford overspill estate has not    
 been without its problems but has     
 generally been a great success        
 providing many new homes.Little Hulton
 faces 3 major problems: unemployment, 
 vandalism and drug abuse.
