		<content> This section of the Avon Valley has   
 suffered, in some respects, from      
 intensive farming but{foxes,  }       
{badgers,stoats, hares and rabbits}are 
 still present in the area.  Less      
 welcome is the influx of{mink.} Among 
 the insect population, there is a wide
 range of varieties of{dragonfly}and   
{damselfly.    }                       
 The{Marsh Warbler}is breeding further 
 up the river than formerly and its    
 nesting sites are under constant      
 supervision.{Redshanks}are also again 
 in the area. The{Curlew}is becoming   
 a frequent visitor but, as yet, has   
 not bred.                             
 Though tree cover has been severely   
 reduced by Dutch Elm disease,there are
 some small copses of ash and hornbeam.
 The common land near  Woodmancote was 
 previously a salt works and has some  
 unusual plants, e.g.{Sea Club Rush.}  </content>
