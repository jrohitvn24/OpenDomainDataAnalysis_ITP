		<content> There  are many  clever  and  artistic
 people in Burton who excel  in various
 arts and crafts. There are a number of
{painters} using  oils,  water-colours,
 charcoal and other media. The late Mrs
 Bessie  Tapsell taught some people how
 to make  3-dimensional pictures  using
 fine  nylon  and  silk  materials  and
 embroidery stitches.  She  called this
 form of art,{Ethereal.} Several people
 enjoy showing their skills in{pottery,
 exhibiting   in  the  local  show   in
 August.{  Photography}  has  become  a
 popular   hobby,   a   few   villagers
 belonging   to   Bentham  Photographic
 Society.   Our village has a number of
 people  interested ( and talented ) in
{flower - arranging,} displaying  their
 skills  by  competing  and  making   a
 colourful contribution to local flower
 shows.
