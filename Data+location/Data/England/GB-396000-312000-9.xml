		<content>Both my mum and dad are unemployed. Mom
worked in a factory where they cut foam
for cushions etc. but she stopped work 
when she was expecting me. Six years   
later she worked at home soldering     
parts for machinery, but she gave it up
after a couple of years. My dad used to
work on a JCB digger. He's been out of 
work for six years. If mom or dad got a
job I would be very pleased.           
My dad works on building sites all over
the place. His firm is Comben Homes    
He travels to work on a minibus which  
picks everybody up. He starts work at  
0830 and gets home at 1710. At about   
1300 they have their dinner in a       
canteen. My dad's firm used to be      
Whittinghams but Comben Homes took     
them over.                             
My sister works on Hednesford Market.  
She says that she gets ninety pounds a 
week!                                  </content>
