		<title>03Shopping in Clapham</title>
		<content> If you wanted groceries you could go  
 to a certain number of places in      
 Clapham like Freezewell or the place  
 near Jack Foster's.   Freezewell is   
 very near to the school.  In fact,    
 it's right opposite to it and it has  
 two exits, a back one and a front one,
 but the front one is the most popular.
 Inside it is very spacious except for 
 one long freezer and 36 other         
 freezers.   It is open from Monday to 
 Wednesday from 9.OO a.m. to 5.3O p.m. 
 Thursday is 9.OO a.m. to 6.OO p.m.    
 Friday is 9.OO a.m. to 8.OO p.m.      
 Saturday is 9.OO a.m. to 6.OO p.m. and
 Sunday is 1O.3O a.m. to 4.3O p.m.   It
 sells quite a lot of things including 
 frozen foods, cereals, ice cream,     
 vegetables, spirits, sweets, meat and 
 fish.
