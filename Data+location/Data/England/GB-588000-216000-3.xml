		<content> Tiptree is famous for strawberries.All
 through the year,the growers tend     
 their fields to get ready for the     
 influx of visitors in the picking     
 season.In the 1980's "Pick Your Own"  
 has become so popular that the County 
 have put signs on the outskirts of    
 Tiptree saying:PICK YOUR OWN AREA     
                PLEASE PARK WHERE SHOWN
 During June &amp; July visitors come by   
 the coach load and strip the fields of
 the delicious fruit.                  
 The 1985 season was later than usual  
 because of a cold wet spring and a wet
 start to the summer.This year the     
 fruit started off at about 60 pence a 
 pound and reduced week by week to     
 about 30 pence a pound.
