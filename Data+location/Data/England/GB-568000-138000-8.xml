		<title>08Horsmonden School Functions</title>
		<content>The main school function of the year is
Family Day when people come to the     
school field and there are stalls,     
sponsored events, displays of dancing  
and gymnastics.  On Sports Day all the 
parents come to watch and the children 
race against each other.  Every Summer 
for the District Sports all the schools
in the Weald district go to one school 
to race.  This year it was at Marden.  
There are three football and netball   
rallies in a year.  For the Music      
Festival a lot of schools get together 
at Cranbrook and sing and play         
instruments to an audience.  The Drama 
Festival is when a few schools in our  
district come to our school and        
entertain each other with plays.  A    
school pantomime is always held at     
Christmas in which all the teachers and
juniors take part.
