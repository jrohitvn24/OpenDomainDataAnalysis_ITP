		<content> The A17 leads to Sleaford, Newark and 
 Norfolk. Lots of big vehicles use it. 
 There are jams in the summer. There   
 are accidents on the bends in         
 Saracen's Head, so a new road is being
 planned. The country roads are very   
 narrow. Some tracks leading to the    
 farms are not metalled. They are      
 stony. The heavy lorries and tractors 
 that come from farms bring loads of   
 supplies for factories. The big       
 lorries  and tractors are hard to     
 overtake. Some people said that the   
 country roads should be wider. Others 
 said that they should be only wider in
 the villages. There are no footpaths  
 on the country roads and it can be    
 dangerous when big vehicles go past.  
 There is one public service bus a     
 week. It runs on Saturdays and takes  
 people to Boston for shopping.
