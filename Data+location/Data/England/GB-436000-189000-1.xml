		<title>01W. Grove an Introduction</title>
		<content> This area is mainly used for mixed    
 farming, but has a small village,     
 Denchworth, and Grove a 20th century  
 residential section. Denchworth is a  
 typical dormant village, while Grove  
 is gradually developing its own       
 amenities instead of being so         
 dependent, as formerly, on Wantage;   
 although there are still many closely 
 related interests, W.Grove has about  
 4,500 people and Denchworth 130.      
 Denchworth has thatched, stonebuilt   
 cottages, a manor house, a medieaval  
 church, an inn, but no amenities.     
 W.Grove has a modern church, primary  
 school, two recreation grounds, new   
 small industries, a community centre  
 and is near shops and other amenities.
 The area is flat, moderately fertile  
 but unremarkable but shows great      
 contrast between the two villages.
