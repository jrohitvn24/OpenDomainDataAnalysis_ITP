		<title>04FARMING AROUND INCE BLUNDELL</title>
		<content>   This is an area of mixed farming.At 
 the time of our survey,May-June,      
 Barley,Wheat and Oats were ripening in
 the fields.The potato crops were well 
 -established but the sugar beet was   
 still at a early stage of growth.The  
 feilds given over to grass were almost
 ready for mowing after which the      
 cattle would be allowed graze.        
  Vegetables such as cauliflowers,     
 carrots, sprouts and peas were also   
 growing.                              
  Farming methods were modern and      
 highly mechanised.                    
  The cattle are kept for beef and are 
 mainly Charolais, Freisians and       
 crosses.                              
  we surveyed six farms which covered  
 about 75% of the area.We found that,  
 of the 62 fields surveyed, 61% were in
 either potatoes or barley
