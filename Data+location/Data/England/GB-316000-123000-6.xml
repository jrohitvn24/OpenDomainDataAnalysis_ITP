		<title>06River walk. Bradford to Hele</title>
		<content>   Our walk started from               
 Bradford-on-Tone bridge, probably a   
 15th century structure as the 1698    
 carved on the parapets undoubtedly    
 refers to the date of repairs. We     
 followed the North side of the river  
 past the scene of a murder of a       
 milkman in the early 1980's who tried 
 to intervene in a domestic crisis.    
   Hele Manor and a riding school with 
 its jumping course were passed on the 
 other side and we enjoyed the wealth  
 of blackberries and opportunities to  
 'skim' stones in the weir pools.      
   A  sewage farm and the remains of   
 the Grand Western Canal were seen and 
 our attention was temporarily         
 distracted by the buzzing of the      
 overhead cables leading to the CEGB   
 transmission station.
