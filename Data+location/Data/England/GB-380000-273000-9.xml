 Housing in the area is substantially  
 local council built.                  
 Birchen Coppice Estate of 661 houses  
 was opened on 1st May, 1946 and the   
 Rifle Range Estate of 214 houses was  
 completed in 1965. The 147 houses at  
 Hoobrook were first occupied in 1966. 
 There are two tower blocks of flats at
 Hoobrook. They were closed early in   
 the new year of l970, amid much       
 publicity, following allegations of   
 structural deficiencies. They remained
 empty for a period in excess of five  
 years. The whole episode is shrouded  
 in secrecy.
