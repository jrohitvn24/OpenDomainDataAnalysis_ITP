		<content>   People using the footpaths were     
 taking a short-cut between South      
 Norwood and Elmers End, or were       
 exercising there dogs.                
   Around the edges of this land we    
 were saddened to find places where    
 people had dumed heaps of rubbish.    
 There was garden waste, kitchen       
 equipment such as old fridges and     
 cookers and lots of plastic and glass.
 It was horrible to walk through and   
 made us think about how we can help to
 keep where we live polution-free.
