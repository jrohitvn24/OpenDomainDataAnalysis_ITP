		<title>13Recreation in Itchenor area</title>
		<content> Many recreational pursuits are avail- 
 able at Itchenor; water sports from   
 sailing, surfing,sailboarding and     
 swimming to fishing, either from      
 fishing boats or beach casting.       
  {Walks:}the Sussex Border Path goes  
 round the coast of Thorney; the public
 footpath which runs along the coast   
 from Itchenor to East Head; and many  
 short, linking footpaths.             
  {Birdwatching}is popular at East Head
 and on Thorney and Pilsea Islands. All
 three places are perfect habitats for 
 birds as there is abundant food and   
 little pollution or disturbance,      
 Pilsea having recently been acquired  
 by the R.Soc.Protection of Birds.     
 Yachtsmen visiting Pilsea may walk all
 round the island by way of the beach  
 and across the grassland on the       
 western side, a distance of about 1   
 mile.                                 </content>
