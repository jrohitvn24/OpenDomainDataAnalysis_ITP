		<title>19A LANGUAGE SURVEY  BLACKBURN</title>
		<content>This was a study of the language       
pattern of the occupants of one street 
-Bastwell Rd.Our children wanted to    
find out which language was usually    
spoken at home,and which other ones    
were spoken,written or understood.     
We found that the Asian families knew  
several languages.Many of the women    
knew only a little English, one had to 
be spoken to in Punjabi.Another lady   
was born in India, but had also lived  
in Pakistan &amp; Sudan. She could speak   
Urdu, Punjabi, Farsi, Arabic &amp;         
English.                               
All the Asian men we interviewed spoke 
fluent English. One man from Bangladesh
speaks Bengali, Urdu, Hindi, Arabic,   
Nagri and English.He also understands  
Welsh because he has worked in Swansea.
