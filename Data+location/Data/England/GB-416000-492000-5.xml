		<content>   There's a quiet old_world atmosphere
 about the 15 unspoilt stone houses and
 cottages which line the steep Bank  in
{East Hauxwell. }All of them, including
 three farms,belong to Hauxwell Estate,
 presently the property of Mr.R.Dalton,
 a diplomat who resides at the Hall.   
   Now only one villager is employed on
 the estate.{Counting Ayrlow Banks  and
{West Hauxwell  42 adults live here.}12
 are retired, 8 are housewives,  6 farm
 and the rest  commute to  professional
 or other  jobs. The{13 school children
 bus into Wensleydale,go to Richmond,or
 attend boarding school.  East Hauxwell
{school was closed in 1962.}It's a pity
 to see it and the Reading Room disused
 and in need of repair.  Apart from the
 annual Parish Council meeting  village
 events are rare, but in October an{oak
 tree  will be ceremonially planted  in
 memory of the late Maj.General Dalton.</content>
