		<content> LAUNCHING THE CAISTER-ON-SEA LIFEBOAT 
  The first man opens the doors to the 
 Lifeboatstation, the engineers arrive 
 and start the tractor's engines. The  
 first 8 men, including the coxwain,   
 are crew. The tractor driver reverses 
 out of the station,pushing the boat   
 before him. The cox waits until the   
 tractor's tracks are awash. This      
 signifies that the boat is capable of 
 floating. The cox blows a whistle &amp;   
 simultaneous operations occur. The    
 driver disengages from the trailer &amp;  
 drives up the beach. The 4 crew       
 positioned around the boat knock the  
 pins holding the boat onto the trailer
 clear, and the 'fall groups' continue 
 pulling until the boat leaves the     
 trailer. The cox nows sees the boat   
 can travel under its own power, and   
 thus the lifeboat is launched.
