		<content> I live in the Fox Inn, I am ten years 
 old and my name is Terri. On Mondays  
 to Saturdays we open at ll o'clock. We
 do not have many customers in the     
 afternoon. The people who work for us 
 in the afternoon are Kay and Trevor.  
 We have got two kitchens; one is the  
 pub's and the other is for our own    
 use. In the lounge we have some plates
 on the wall for decoration and we also
 have a big picture of a hunt over the 
 chimney breast. We sell snacks and a  
 lot of meals. We sell lemonade and    
 different cordials; we also sell beer 
 wine and spirits. We have our own     
 bedrooms. My Dad has the biggest      
 bedroom, then I have the medium sized 
 one and the little room is spare where
 my friend Emma sleeps the night or    
 when my Nanna and Grandad sleep. We   
 have a little bathroom. We have big   
 outbuildings. We have got  2 horses.  </content>
