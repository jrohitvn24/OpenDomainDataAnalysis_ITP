		<title>12Where people worship.</title>
		<content>  There  is  only  one  open  church or
 chapel within our area, although  just
 outside there are several places where
 residents go to worship.              
  Hordley's church  has  a  Norman nave
 and chancel with an interior'improved'
 by  the  Victorians.  Some  20  people
 worship here and services are taken by
 the vicar  of Baschurch. The church at
 Frankton  is just outside our area but
 a  number  of Frankton's  congregation
 are from our area. A  number of people
 in  Tetchill  are  active  members  of
 Ellesmere's   church.  These   include
 bellringers and members of the choir. 
  There used to be  a chapel  in  Lower
 Frankton  but as  the  population  has
 declined  this  has  now closed and is
 about to be converted into a dwelling.
 Present  day  chapel goers  go to  Lee
 Bridges,Frankton or Ellesmere.        
  Catholics go to Ellesmere Convent.   </content>
