		<title>04Planning Problems</title>
		<content>   There is little land available for  
 development.A general hospital is     
 desperately needed and there are plans
 to build one on allotments, but there 
 are financial problems.Available land 
 has been used for service rather than 
 manufacturing industries.Although     
 small industrial units have been      
 developed in a former secondary       
 school.The old school canteen is being
 developed into a community centre but 
 is hampered by vandalism.The most     
 controversial schemes are the Benfield
 Valley and the Brighton by-pass.      
 Housing in Hove is very expensive.The 
 aveage 3 bedroomed semi-detached house
 costs around Â£45 000. Many seafront   
 dwellings have been turned into       
 flatlets.New housing and council      
 houses are selling quickly.Lack of    
 public housing is a problem.Money is  
 spent on improving council houses.    </content>
