		<title>05Yaxham Area Shopping Habits</title>
		<content> The children of the Primary School did
 a short survey on where a sample of   
 the people in Yaxham get their food   
 supplies. Out of 15 families asked, 10
 said that they get their meat from    
 East Dereham (about 3 miles away) 2 go
 to the nearby village of Mattishall   
 and only 1 had their meat delivered.  
 (Deep freeze storage has made a very  
 great difference to villages, enabling
 stocks of food to be held for a long  
 period.  Most people have a car, but  
 the bus service to Dereham is not very
 good) Nearly everyone has milk        
 delivered daily, but most buy their   
 bread from Dereham shops or the       
 Mattishall Bakery.                    
 Local farms and smallholdings provide 
 fresh vegetables and fruit (as does   
 the Post Office Stores in Yaxham and a
 mobile shop.)
