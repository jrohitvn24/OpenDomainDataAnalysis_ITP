		<content> Shirwell is not serviced by public    
 transport of any kind.  (The only     
 railway to run through the district   
 was the line from Barnstaple to Lynton
 but this was 'axed' long before even  
 the cuts of Dr. Beeching).  There is, 
 however, a market bus which covers the
 route from Lynton to Barnstaple (and  
 return) twice a week and which will   
 call in at points around the route    
 provided that prior notice has been   
 given.                                
   Many people are able to get 'lifts' 
 into the town (Barnstaple) and        
 shopping trips are often arranged when
 groups get together - yet another     
 example of the typical, rural         
 community spirit.                     
   One local farmer may often be seen  
 riding along in a horse and trap.
