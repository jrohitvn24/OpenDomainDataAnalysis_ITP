		<title>12A village christening</title>
		<content>Charlotte Kate, our daughter,was       
baptised in the village church. She    
wore the cream silk robe her father had
worn.I like to think our grandchildren,
even great-grandchildren will wear it -
tradition is comforting.               
Children from the village school led   
the service, reading prayers,singing to
us and leading the hymns. Their proud  
parents watched. We,prouder still,     
watched Charlotte. With her Godparents 
we moved to the chancel steps, and     
promising a Christian upbringing for   
our child, the sign of the cross was   
made on her head. With other members of
the family we gathered round the font  
as Charlotte was baptised- the holy    
water poured on her head. It was a     
special moment!                        
Returning home, we celebrated, presents
were opened, and champagne flowed.     
Charlotte, her role fulfilled, slept.  </content>
