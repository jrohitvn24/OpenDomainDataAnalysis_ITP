		<title>20THE SCHOOL:  ST.JOHNS CHAPEL</title>
		<content> The school at St.John's Chapel has 66 
 children aged from 5-11, 2 teachers,  
 2 part time teachers and a headmaster.
    Most of the children come from the 
 villages of St.John's Chapel, Daddry  
 Shield and Westgate but a few come    
 from Ireshopeburn,  Wearhead and the  
 surrounding farms. Some children come 
 to school on the bus and some by      
 school taxi. School starts at 9am     
 and finishes at 3.30pm. The lunches   
 are cooked at Stanhope and are brought
 to school in a van but many of the    
 children prefer to bring their own    
 packed lunch.                         
    As well as learning to read, write,
 and do maths the children have lessons
 in art, pottery, music, dancing, games
 and studies(science/histoty/geography)
 The juniors go swimming at Wolsingham 
 every week . Every Tuesday the local  
 ministers hold a religious service.   </content>
