		<content>   {Clawton}is a friendly place.It is  
 mostly a farming area.The farmland is 
 mainly grassland.The Farmers keep     
{animals}like sheep and cows.          
    The buildings are mostly quite     
 old.Some of them are set down lanes.  
    There is a{Holsworthy}Wood which   
 consists of coniferous trees.There is 
 also one garage owned by Mr.Budge.    
    Although{Clawton}gets few          
 tourists,there is a hotel called{Court
{Barn}which would look after them.Court
 Barn is very cosy.The owner and his   
 wife are very friendly.               
    The nearest town is called         
{Holsworthy.Bus services}are very few  
 in Clawton.So people rely on cars or  
 by foot.                              
    The{River Claw}runs through        
 Clawton.There is one cul de sac called
