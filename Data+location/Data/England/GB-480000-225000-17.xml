		<title>17The School Cook</title>
		<content>   I started as a canteen helper in    
1951.The lunch was sent from Winslow in
a heated container;meat and two        
vegetables or fish,ham and bacon flan, 
jam tart,bread pudding,sponge and      
custard or rice.I washed up in one bowl
and rinsed in another.The water was    
heated in an electric boiler which I   
filled each day from a tap in the      
cloakroom which is now the cleaner's   
store cupboard.                        
   When a kitchen was built in 1965 I  
became a cook\caterer.There is an      
electrically driven oil stove with two 
ovens and one heating cupboard and it  
heats the water;one big sink;one       
sterilizer;an electric fryer;a food    
mixer and a refrigerator.Tea towels and
cloths are boiled each day in a pan.   
   I work for 27.5 hours a week.22     
children have dinner now;it was 36 in  
1951 and 83 in 1965.                   </content>
