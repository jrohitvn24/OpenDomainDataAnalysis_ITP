		<title>11Changes in housing patterns.</title>
		<content>There arenÂ£t many new houses in        
Ellastone. Only 10 have been built in  
the last 20 years.One reason beinng the
lack of a proper sewerage system. The  
vicarage has been sold and a new       
bungalow built. There are no council   
houseÂ£s in the village. A house you    
could buy for 6,000 pounds 20 years ago
would cost you about 60,000 now.This   
means that local young people canÂ£t    
afford to buy the houseÂ£s and many more
older retired people are moving into   
the area. Part of the village is a     
conservation area. Some people now come
to Ellastone in caravans for holidays. 
Farmers are only  allowed 5 caravanÂ£s  
on each farm.
