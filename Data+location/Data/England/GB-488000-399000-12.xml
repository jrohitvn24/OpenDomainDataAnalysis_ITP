		<title>12Scotter - The Village</title>
		<content> Scotter has grown quickly,the         
 population more than doubling in the  
 last{20 years.}New houses have been   
 built on large estates throughout the 
 village.Houses vary greatly in size   
 and style.The{Parish Council}has no   
 direct control over what is built and 
 can only make recommendations.For     
 several years they have been fighting 
 a legal battle over the style of one  
 house.In a survey people stated that  
 they thought the village was now too{ 
{large.}The majority of people regard  
 Scotter as a peaceful,friendly village
 in pretty surroundings.The building of
 the village hall has caused much      
 discussion.Some people believe it is  
 too large and too far from the centre 
 of the village.Most see it as a       
 valuable amenity with its large hall, 
 liscensed bar,well equipped kitchen   
 and rooms for local groups to use.    </content>
