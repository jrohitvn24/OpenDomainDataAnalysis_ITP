		<content> With a grant from{COSIRA }The owner   
 of Boating World is hoping to         
 establish a cottage industry.When     
 asked if he would be likely to expand 
 he replied with a most definite{"YES".
  The industry has already found a     
 potential mascot,an old barge,which   
 was used during the days of the {     
{"SECOND WORLD WAR."}The barge still   
 remains at the very same place where  
 it was sunk.                          
 Approximately eleven people have      
 been employed here and the firm is    
 currently involved with making fibre  
 glass dinghys and boats using the "old
 fashioned method."                    
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
