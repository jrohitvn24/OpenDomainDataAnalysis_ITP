		<content>   Another village of historic         
 interest is Harley which has a number 
 of treasures within the church.  A    
 crude Norman is there and also a fine 
 small 15th Century chest which has    
 iron bands.  The silver Paten is over 
 500 years old and has an engraved head
 of Christ as well as a small flower on
 either side.  Threre is also an       
 Elizabethian silver chalice.          
   There are three panels of old glass 
 showing the Salutation, Nativity and  
 Presentation in the temple.  In the   
 tower, which is 15th Century, is an   
 unnamed brass of a man in armour.  It 
 is thought that this brass could be a 
 memorial to Sir Richard Lacon,        
 Sheriff of Shrewsbury in 1477.        
 Benjamin Jenks, who wrote many prayers
 and meditations, was Rector here for  
 56 years.
