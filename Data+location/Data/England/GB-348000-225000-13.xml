		<content> Fruit Farm - Harvesting               
      Harvesting is from early         
 September to late October, the dates  
 determined by starch-testing the      
 fruit.  Part of the crop is picked by 
 P.Y.O. customers and the remainder by 
 20 local women.  Current casual labour
 wages are Â£l.94/hour although for     
 apple harvesting a price is paid for  
 bulk bin picked.  The crop is stored  
 in these , which hold about 600 lbs.  
 Barn storing gives a better ripening  
 process and many customers buy in bulk
 to continue the storage process.      
      October to the end of March sees 
 the packing and marketing of the      
 fruit.  Much is sold directly to the  
 public and wholesalers  from the farm 
 shop, excess  is marketed in Hereford 
 or Cardiff.  Surplus Golden Delicious 
 are sent to Ledbury for babyfoods.
