		<title>06Retired People in Warton</title>
		<content>    42.9% of adults are retired, most  
having a pension for main income. A    
flourishing Pensioner's Group founded  
for the 1953 coronation meets monthly. 
    Many are taking advantage of grants
to improve old property. Typical is an 
83 yr old who has just had a new roof, 
insulation and central heating.        
    A daughter of the builder of the   
1902 school still treasures his old    
school books of 1872. She claims people
retire here because it is a friendly   
place and feels there are no excesses  
of weather. Another claims that Warton 
is "God's little acre".                
    One man recalls a population of 326
of whom he knew every one. He regrets  
the stopping of tolling the church     
bell to warn of a new death, 24 for a  
man and 12 for a woman.  Though ended  
in 1917 the passing of this tradition  
is still a sore point with many.       </content>
