		<title>01THE HETTON AREA</title>
		<content> The area lies close to the North Sea  
 Coast on the South_Western perimeter  
 of the Borough of Sunderland. The     
 village of Hetton_Le_Hole dates back  
 to Anglo_Saxon times{(Heppedune).     
 Our industrial history is linked with 
 coal. Hetton gained fame through the  
 railway which linked its colliery with
 the Wear at Sunderland.The original   
 wagon_way was constructed by{George   
{Stephenson}in 1819.                   
 New industry has developed. One       
 example of this is the industrial     
 estate which lies on the site of the  
 former Hetton Lyons Colliery.         
 Although Hetton is an Industrial Area 
 there is,{agricultural}land around.   
 The Moorsley and East Rainton area    
 consists of open country.             
 Private and Council houses have       
 improved. The residents are close to  
 several{attractive towns}and{cities.  </content>
