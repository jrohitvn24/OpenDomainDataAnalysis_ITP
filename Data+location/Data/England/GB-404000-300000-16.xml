		<title>16Interview, Aldridge resident</title>
		<content> This is part of an interview with Mrs.
 Dorothy Wynne.                        
 "I came to Aldridge as a child with my
 family from Walsall in 1922. Our house
 had oil lamps which burned paraffin.  
 The only heating in the house was by  
 coal fires, we had no electricity, no 
 gas and we had no taps in the house.  
 We got our water from 2 pumps in the  
 yard.{The Croft}had a hedge around it 
 and gates and the farmer kept his cows
 on it, children going to school had to
 dodge them. There was a large iron gas
 lamp at the bottom of the High Street 
 with a horse trough under it. Coal    
 from{Stubbers Green,}milk and bread   
 all came by horse and cart. There was 
 an old stone Toll House at the corner 
 of Walsall Rd and Birmingham Rd. The  
 village has become a town. The thing I
 am most glad about is that childrens  
 educational opportunities are better. </content>
