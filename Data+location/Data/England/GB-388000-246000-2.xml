		<title>02Hermitage Farm Wadborough 1.</title>
		<content> The land coverage around Hermitage    
 Farm is fields. Mr Lole partly rents  
 the farm, he grows crops such as      
 Beans, peas, wheat (Durum) and  oil   
 seed rape, he has approximately 220   
 hectares. He has 30 hectares of beans.
 He stores the beans in big iron bins. 
 He grows 20 hectares of peas. He also 
 needs fertilizer for his crops. Mr    
 Lole uses a{Rotation}for his crops, if
 he plants beans in one field and it   
 takes all the goodness out of the     
 soil, he will then plant grass there  
 to put the goodness back into the     
 soil. So a{Rotation}is an important   
 job. He grows 15 hectares of Durum    
 (wheat).The ground is good enough for 
 Durum (wheat) but it also needs       
 fertilizer. He has to plant that      
 before Christmas, he puts the         
 fertilizer on later in the year.
