      First you go in the car or you   
 walk to the{strawberry field}.A man   
 weighs your basket(s) and containers, 
 writes the basket's weight on to it so
 that you don't pay for the weight of  
 the basket. You take your own         
 containers or can buy a cardboard     
 basket from the grower. The whole     
 field is full of{strawberry plants}   
 and you are free to pick as much as   
 you like. People usually eat some     
 while they are picking.               
      To pick a{strawberry}you have to 
 push around the bush and pick a red   
 one. It's important to pick a red one 
 because if you pick a white one it    
 isn't ripe. When you think you have   
 got enough, you go to the man to get  
 the{strawberries}weighed and paid for.
      The first week in July they cost 
 45p a pound.                          </content>
