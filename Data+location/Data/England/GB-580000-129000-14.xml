		<content>     We have a greater proportion of   
 older{residents}but in recent year an 
 interesting development has been the  
 influx of younger families. In the 20 
 residences of the village street we   
 now have infants and school children. 
 12 similar families live within       
 quarter mile.                         
     A composite picture of these      
 younger families would show father,   
 mother and two children living in a   
 detached house with fairly spacious   
 accommodation and running two cars.   
 The daughter is at infant school, the 
 son only two.  Both parents work, he  
 fulltime, she for part of the week.   
 child care, running of the house and  
 shopping are shares tasks. Daytime    
 activities are, for the most part,    
 based in and around the Village;ballet
 lessons,playschool,toddler group,     
 swimming and visits to friends houses.</content>
