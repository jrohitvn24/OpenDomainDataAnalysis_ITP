		<title>08A VISIT TO HILL FARM.</title>
		<content>{Hill Farm}is a farm near Upend. Lord  
 Fairhaven owns it and Mrs Bowyer is   
 the Tenant. She told us about the     
 farm and showed us round.             
 The farm is about 350 acres big.      
 They grow barley which is like  wheat 
 but has long purplish brown whiskers  
 and is mostly used for animal feed.   
 They grow wheat which is thick and    
 green.It is used for flour to make    
 bread and biscuits. And they also grow
 beans which are shipped out to        
 Germany. They spray the fields with   
 aerial sprays, to keep weeds and      
 insects down.                         
 The main machines they have on the    
 farm are Case tractors and combine    
 harvesters. The combines separates the
 straw from the grain and sends the    
 straw out of the big hole in the      
 bottom.
