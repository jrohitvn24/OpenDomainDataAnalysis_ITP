		<title>11CROSS HOUSES HOSPITAL</title>
		<content> The Hospital was built in 1834 as a   
{Workhouse.}During the 1914-18 War it  
 became a hospital for{wounded soldiers
 and in 1925 became a{General and      
{Maternity}Hospital. In 1967 it became 
 a{Geriatric Hospital.}The 3 storied   
 building has 5 wards - one is a small 
 surgical unit with its own theatre.   
 There are about 84 beds in use. There 
 is a kitchen. Dirty laundry is sent to
 the Royal Shrewsbury Hospital. There  
 is a physiotherapy unit and an X-Ray  
 department. The cuts in the National  
 Health Service money and the          
 requirements for the planned Telford  
 Hospital means that{closure           
 announcements for Cross Houses        
 Hospital are expected shortly.        
 Patients will likely transfer to      
 Shrewsbury and the building become an 
 office administration block for the   
 Area Health Authority.                </content>
