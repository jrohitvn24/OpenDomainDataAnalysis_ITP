		<title>18SCHOOL LESSONS IN HESSLE</title>
		<content> This is the account of a 9 year-old   
 pupil describing her school timetable:
       "At school we learn Maths,      
 Science, Language and Reading and many
 other things. We all like Games, it is
 a lot of fun. My favourite subject at 
 school is Topic Work. I like it       
 because of all the pictures you can   
 draw. Also I like making up my own    
 stories. Last term in our Topic       
 lessons, we studied the Normans, this 
 term we are studying Islands. I like  
 writing and I like Maths. We have some
 forecast sheets at the back of our    
 book so our teacher does not have to  
 tell us what our next page of Maths   
 is."                                  
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
