		<content>  Stansted Airport, East of Bishop's   
 Stortford in Essex has been confirmed 
 as London's third airport. It is going
 to be increased in size so it can take
 more passengers. At the moment        
 Stansted is taking 2 M. passengers a  
 year, but when it is expanded Stansted
 will take 9M. passengers a year.      
 It's development will almost certainly
 affect our area. As well as boosting  
 the amount of planes over             
 Sawbridgeworth/High Wych which will   
 increase aircraft noise drasticaly    
 it will also increase traffic through 
 this area. More people will probably  
 want to live locally because of the   
 expansion. An extra bypass is being   
 considered to run around Bishop's     
 Stortford. The extension of Stansted  
 will create new jobs. It will also    
 have a new terminal.Most local people 
 are against the expansion of Stansted.</content>
