 edge of an industrial area including  
 ICI and BSC.Most of this happening in 
 post 1945.Within is the established   
 community of Dormanstown which was    
 built to house the steel workers of   
 the Dorman Long firm.Our Comprehensive
 School,Westfields,takes pupils from   
 Dormanstown and most of the housing in
 the block.
