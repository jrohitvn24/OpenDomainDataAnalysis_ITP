		<title>19KELSEY HEAD'S BUTTERFLIES</title>
		<content> Kelsey Head is a{Butterfly reserve.}  
 When we were there we spotted seven or
 eight different species of butterflies
 and moths.  First we saw a{Bernet Moth
 which has seven spots on each wing.   
 Next we saw a black and white moth    
 which we couldn't identify. We spotted
 a golden moth, camouflaged as a leaf, 
 a{Large White}butterfly and a light   
{Peppered Moth.} We saw a beautiful    
 pale blue butterfly which we later    
 found out was an{Adonis Blue.} The    
 last butterfly we found was a bright  
 green colour, this was a{Green Hair-  
{streak.} This headland is a good area 
 for butterflies because it is coastal 
 heathland.  Whilst there we also saw  
 lots of other wildlife, including     
 rabbits, a grasshopper, a seven-      
 spotted ladybird and a brightly       
 patterned caterpillar.
