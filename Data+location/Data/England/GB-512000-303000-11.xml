		<content> NAME.                                 
    The name of Glinton church is      
 S.T.Benedicts because at that time the
 Cathederal had Benedictine Monks      
 in.Thechurch has two preasent         
 wardens,MRS.NEVERSON and MR.SAUNDERS. 
 These people have a crook to symbolise
 their position in the church.One of   
 the wardens represents the Bishop and 
 the other represents the Queen and the
 people.                               
                                       
 GARGOYLS.                             
        The Gargoyls on Glinton church 
 are to grighten away devil and drain  
 the water off the roof.One of the     
 Gargoyls is in a different possition  
 because when they were built the      
 Bishop didn't pay the mason enough    
 money so he pointed it in a different 
 position to embarrase the town.
