		<title>01Summary Of Our Area</title>
		<content>   The block we have studied is S.E.   
 of Carlisle.It is mainly agricultural 
 and most of the land is used for      
 sileage or pasture, although          
 there is some barley grown for feeding
 stock.Most farms are dairy with herds 
 of British Friesian.Few hedges have   
 been taken out so our countryside is  
 criss-crossed with hedges of          
 hawthorn,blackthorn,blackberry,some   
 crab apple,wild plum and ash.         
   There is a sprinkling of many other 
 trees but no large areas of standing  
 timber.                               
   There are two villages in our       
 area,Wetheral and Cumwhinton and two  
 which overlap,Scotby and Great        
 Corby.There has been a lot of building
 in Wetheral and Scotby less in Great  
 Corby and very little in              
 Cumwhinton.Many of the people living  
 in the villages work in Carlisle.     </content>
