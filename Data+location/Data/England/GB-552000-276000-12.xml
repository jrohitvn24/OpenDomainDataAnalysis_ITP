		<content> Life in the area in the 1930's was    
 very much based on agriculture, many  
 of the men worked on the land and had 
 little free time from their labours.  
 Special days such as Christmas,       
 Sundays were little different except  
 there was no land work, just caring   
 for the animals. Days out were taken  
 at the market and Cambridge Fair once 
 a year. Holidays were very rare,      
 honeymoon taken in Sheffield. Today   
 however, things are rather different. 
 The working day is much shorter (8.00 
 a.m. - 5.30 p.m.), they get more      
 holidays and because of the better    
 rates of pay (Â£125 per week), foreign 
 holidays are taken. Days out to the   
 market, Machinery Sales and Big Summer
 Shows (Royal Show, East of England    
 Show etc) are common. Animals are rare
 on the farm so more time available.
