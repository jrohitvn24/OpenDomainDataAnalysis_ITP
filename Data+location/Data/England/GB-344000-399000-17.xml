 Rainford:All Saints Church of England,
 Corpus Christi Roman Catholic Church, 
 Higher Lane United Reform Church and  
 The Methodist Chapel on Ormskirk Road.
   All Saints Church is situated on    
 Church Road in the centre of the      
 village.It was built in the nineteenth
 century and features a fine clock     
 tower and and an extensive graveyard. 
   Corpus Christi Church is located at 
 the top of Albert Street.It is a very 
 modern building having been completed 
 in 1980. The Parish Priest is Mgr. Mc 
 Kenna.                                
   These two churches provide a marked 
 contrast in styles between the modern 
 and the traditional.
