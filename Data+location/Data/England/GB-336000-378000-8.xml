		<content>    The{Yew Tree}in the graveyard is   
 over 1500 years old and is one of the 
 oldest in Britain even though we have 
 no certain proof of its age. Though   
 lots of it has rotted it is still     
 living but is not very healthy.       
    The{Lytch Gate,}or gate of the dead
 was so named because coffins were     
 carried through on their way to       
 burial;it is 100 years old.           
    The{Sundial}in the graveyard dates 
 back to 1700. Most of the graves are  
 facing East to wait for the second    
 coming of Jesus.                      
    There have been quite a few things 
 added to the church in the past 5     
 years; like the new roof which has    
 only just been completed and the      
 lanterns which have given in memory of
 loved ones.
