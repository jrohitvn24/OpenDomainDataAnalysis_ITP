		<title>09THE TEXACO STORAGE PLANT</title>
		<content>{                                      
  The Texaco Storage Plant is on the   
 left hand side of Haven Road. It is   
 also quite close to the London And    
 Costal Oil Wharves which is slightly  
 bigger and contains highly dangerous  
 chemicals. The Texaco Storage tanks   
 themselves are about three double-    
 decker buses high which is about 15   
 metres. The petrol tankers which      
 deliver the petrol to Texaco garages, 
 make their deliveries all over the    
 South-East Coast of England. The      
 security at the Texaco station is very
 tight because the fences are          
 approximately 3 metres high. It has   
 also got barbed wire all along the top
 of the fence. A bomb did go off at the
 terminal a few years ago, in 1979, but
 no great damage was done, and there   
 wasn't a massive explosion.
