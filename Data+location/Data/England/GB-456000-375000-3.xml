		<content>     The distribution of tree types in 
 the Welbeck Estate runs as follows;   
                                       
       HARDWOODS             60%       
   (Oak,Sweet Chestnut+Beech)          
       SOFTWOODS             40%       
   (Conifers,mainly Pine)              
                                       
     Parts of the woodland are kept    
 intact for game to breed.Occasionally 
 the tree felling season is interrupted
 by the game shooting season.          
     The felled timber is used mainly  
 on the estate itself for repair work  
 and for the construction of fencing   
 posts and gates. Between twelve and   
 twenty acres of woodland are farmed   
 annually.The estate also has its own  
 treatment plant which preserves the   
 timber.                               
                                       
                                       </content>
