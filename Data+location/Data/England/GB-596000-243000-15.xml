		<content>Lindsey and Kersey, part of which falls
in our 'area' are historically famous  
for wool - Kersey and Lindsey Woolsey. 
There are superb weavers cottages      
within the area and the area is much   
visited.                               
There is a Norman castle in Lindsey but
it is really just earth works.  I do   
not believe that any visible stonework 
remains.                               
There is an Augustinian Priory Ruin    
within the area, but it is in private  
hands and access to it is not          
permitted.                             
The previous chapel of the castle, St. 
James' Chapel is in the care of the    
Department of the Environment.  It had 
many different uses before its recent  
recognition as an historical building.
