		<content> There are three churches in the area, 
 although two are no longer used as    
 such.  One is now the Atlantis Gallery
 and the other the Red Cross Hall, both
 being situated in the High Street. The
 main Parish Church, however, is St.   
 Mary's, and the earliest part dates   
 from 1350 and is the tower on the     
 north aisle.  The nave and the west   
 tower were built in 1449, and the     
 tower has six bells, the oldest of    
 which is dated 1528.  The Jacobean    
 screen was built in 1620.  Possibly   
 the finest part of the building is the
 chancel, which was built by Sir       
 Charles Berkeley in 1743.  The church 
 is twinned with that in Williamsburg, 
 in America, which bears the same name 
 and dates from the time when Sir      
 William Berkeley was Governor of      
 Virginia. Recently, a new graveyard   
 was opened at Cuckoo Hill.            </content>
