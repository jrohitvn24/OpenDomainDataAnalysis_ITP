		<title>13Employment in Gillingham</title>
		<content> After the closure of the Dockyard in  
 1984 Gillingham's employment rate     
 wasn't very good. But despite this    
 many people are employed at the       
 Hempstead Valley on the outskirts of  
 the town in the new shopping complex. 
 The jobs are quite well paid because  
 of the long hours the employees haves 
 to put in. (From 8.30 to 6.30 or      
 7-8.30, if you work in the            
 Savacentre). This shopping complex    
 provides great competition against the
 Gillingham Shopping Pedestrian        
 precinct and the Chatham Pentagon     
 Centre. Out of all the shops in       
 Hempstead Valley Shopping Centre the  
 one which employ the most people is   
 Savacsntre because it employs         
 management, cleaners, cashiers and    
 store detectives plus shelf stockers.
