		<content> A well known local persuit is "tubing"
 Children lash a number of inner tubes 
 together and walk the raft up stream  
 as far as Trigon then float down      
 stream to the Old Mill or North       
 Bridge.  The river is not all that    
 wide and is quite shallow.            
 The common is used a great deal for   
 walking, riding, horse jumping, (many 
 people graze their horses on the      
 common), and angling.  The river      
 contains fish such as roach, pike,    
 trout, salmon, sea trout and rainbow  
 trout introduced from the U.S.A.      
 Trigon Estate - This is a large       
 country estate, it has it's own game  
 keeper who raises pheasants.  Shoots  
 are organised and cost Â£100 per day.  
 Stalking of Sika and Roe deer is let  
 to foreign tourists from France,      
 Belgium and Germany.  They shoot      
 primarily for sport and trophies.     </content>
