		<content> The remains of the village pound on   
 Polson Hill dates from the 15th       
 century and is now maintained as a    
 feature by the gardening club.        
 In Fore Street is reputedly the       
 longest continuous row of thatched    
 cottages in Devon.These were built    
 between 1790 and 1810 on land which   
 was part of waste ground forming the  
 centre of,originally,a typical Anglo- 
 Saxon village layout.                 
 The first village school was started  
 in 1733 with money left by Thomasine  
 Tucker,for 16 poor children.They were 
 dressed in blue and provided with a   
 Bible.The original building is now a  
 bungalow,the present school was built 
 by the Church of England in 1872 at a 
 cost of Â£2000 for 280 children.It has 
 in recent years been enlarged to      
 include a kitchen and hall.There are  
 now 115 pupils and 5 staff.           </content>
