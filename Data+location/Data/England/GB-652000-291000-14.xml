Work on the Uplands Community Centre   
building was started on 12th March     
1985. The Community Centre is for the  
people of Burnt Hill, Hollow Grove &amp;   
Rosedale Gardens Estates, because they 
had no hall for clubs or meetings. They
hope it will open for Christmas '85.   
The size of the building is 24m long &amp; 
20m wide. It will cost 100,000 pounds &amp;
some of the money was raised by fetes &amp;
jumble sales. We went to see the first 
brick layed by the chairman &amp; our photo
was in the paper. Outside there will be
a football pitch, car park &amp; a hard    
area for ball games. The clubs will be 
for all age groups. They include       
badmington, Brownies, Cubs, keep fit,  
disco's, bingo, a play group, and a    
clinic to weigh your baby &amp; many more. 
The hall can be hired for functions. It
is a very nice place.                  </content>
