		<content>    Quite a few people earn their      
 living by using their skills to make  
 things like rugs, walls or other stone
 works. There is a weaver (Mrs.Raynar),
 a potter (Mr.Raynar), a stone mason   
 (Mr.Thompson) and two dry-stone       
 wallers (Mr.Bradley and Mr.Barnett).  
   {Mr.and Mrs.Raynar}are both fairly  
 new at the trade, Mrs.Rayner starting 
 only 3\ years ago, and Mr.Rayner just 
 beginning this summer.                
   {Mr.Thompson}has been at the art    
 since he was three and is now a       
 'senior citizen'. He carves most      
 things and often makes cartoons in    
 stone.                                
    When we saw{Mr.Bradley}and{        
{Mr.Barnett}they were repairing a pond 
 in Colonel Gleadow's garden.They told 
 us that building a stone wall was a   
 slow job. It took us 20 minutes to    
 make a 5 foot stretch of wall.        </content>
