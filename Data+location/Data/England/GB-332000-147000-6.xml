   THE STATION AT HIGHBRIDGE IS NOW A  
PITIFULL SITE.THE OLD BUILDINGS,SAID   
TO HAVE BEEN DESIGNED BY I.K BRUNEL    
WERE RECENTLY DEMOLISHED,DESPITE LOCAL 
OPPOSITION.THESE OLD LIMESTONE         
BUILDINGS HAVE BEEN REPLACED BY TWO    
BRICK BOX LIKE STRUCTURES WHICH        
RESEMBLE BUS SHELTERS.    DESPITE      
THIS,WESTERN REGION SERVICES BETWEEN   
BRISTOL AND TAUNTON STILL HAVE         
STOPPING TRAINS AND,AT                 
PRESENT,SERVICES ARE WELL SUPPORTED.   
IN ITS HEYDAY THE STATION WAS A        
FUNCTION FOR THE G.W.R AND THE         
SOMERSET AND DORSET RAILWAY.THERE WERE 
TWO STATIONS,ENGINE WORKSHOPS,WAGON    
REPAIR SHOPS WITH ROUTES TO DORSET AND
