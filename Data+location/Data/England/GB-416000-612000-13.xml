		<title>13ALNWICK STATION</title>
		<content> Alnwick station was built with        
 sandstone.  The furniture is mainly   
 wood and in the waiting room there was
 a fire place with NER, North Eastern  
 Railways.  The line was in two parts, 
 one goes to Alnmouth and the other    
 goes to Coldstream.  Part of the      
 station has been taken to Beamish Folk
 Museum in County Durham for exhibition
 on trains.                            
                                       
 In the waiting room there was only one
 window that gave very little light.   
 In the winter there would be a fire so
 that people could be warm, but in the 
 summer the fire would not be lit so it
 would be quite cold and dark.  There  
 was only one train on the line at one 
 time because it was a single track.   
 There are no trains now, and the      
 station is closed.  The building is   
 used for industry.                    </content>
