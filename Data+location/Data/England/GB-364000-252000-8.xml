		<title>08BROMYARD EXCHANGE AND GALA</title>
		<content>    About 200 people have visited      
{Athis,}but many more French have come 
 to Bromyard. However, many people in  
 the{Twinning Association}have not     
 visited France. The popularity of the 
{exchange}has remained steady          
 throughout.  Both English and French  
 have a very enjoyable experience. Many
 lasting friendships have been         
 established.                          
    The{Gala}is an annual event held   
 one weekend in{July.}Farm produce,    
 livestock and handicrafts are shown   
 and there are stalls representing     
{local traders.                        
    This event was established in the  
 1960's by the{Chamber of Commerce}to  
 provide a source of entertainment for 
 the people of Bromyard and to put     
 Bromyard 'on the map'. Costs are high 
 so entry fees are collected. Any final
 profits are donated to{charities.     </content>
