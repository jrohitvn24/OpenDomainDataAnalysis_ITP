The block is mainly farmland (arable   
and pasture) between 100 and 158 metres
above sea level and drained by several 
streams which feed the River Tove and  
thence the Great Ouse.  The A413       
crosses the western end from N to S and
passes through the village of          
Whittlebury (population 500) where a   
Victorian reading room serves as a     
village hall.  The site of Whittlebury 
Lodge is now a private housing estate  
adjacent to which is a deer park of 240
hectares.  Lordsfields Farm is of      
historic interest and has the remains  
of a moat.  In the NE corner of the    
block lies part of the village of      
Paulerspury (population 1000) which was
home to the Throckmortons in the 16th  
century.  The Sir Henry Royce Memorial 
Foundation is housed in the village.
