		<title>13 Forestry in Lamberhurst</title>
		<content>   The mixed{coniferous}and{deciduous} 
 woodland in{Lamberhurst}is mainly     
 owned by the Bayham Abbey and Scotney 
 Castle estates.                       
   Every 15 years{chestnut}needs to be{
{coppiced,}which means the trunk is cut
 near ground level. The chestnut stem  
 crop is used for spikes, hop poles and
 fences. Other timber is sold to Norway
 where it is turned into pulp and      
 returned to England for paper making. 
{Birch}and{ash}are grown, ash often for
 tool handles.{Larch, spruce}and{Scots 
{pine}are softwoods used in building.  
 British spruce is weak so rarely used.
{  Beech}and{oak}are hardwoods which   
 also support a wide variety of        
 wildlife. Oak used to be used for     
 gateposts, beams and shipbuilding, but
 is now too expensive because of it's  
 slow rate of growth. A full-time      
 woodman is employed at Scotney.       </content>
