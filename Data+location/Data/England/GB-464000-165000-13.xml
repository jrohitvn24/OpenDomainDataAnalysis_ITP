 area,the Roman Catholics and Metho-   
 dists also have places of worship.    
  St.Oswald's is the Roman Catholic    
 church.The building was built in 1975 
 and opened in 1976,and,although small,
 includes space for a Sunday school and
 a kitchen.The priest is Father G.Hold-
 away.                                 
  In 1985,an Ecumenical Youth Group was
 started to strengthen inter-church and
 community links in the area.A special 
 service was held at St.Oswald's in    
 September.                            
  To mark the 40th anniversary of the  
 Hiroshima atomic bomb,a peace vigil   
 and procession between St.Oswald's and
 Burghfield St.Mary's was held by Fran-
 ciscans in the area in August 1985.
