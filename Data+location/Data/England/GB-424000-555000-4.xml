		<content> There are over 2O clubs in Birtley.   
 Some for over 18'S and some for       
 younger people. The clubs for adults  
 eg The Buffs., Catholic mens club,    
 Birtish Legion, Rex, will sell alcohol
 but are not pubs. In my opinion clubs 
 are not as tidy as pubs and not as    
 well looked after. There are two main 
 Youth Clubs:- Barley Mow Y.C. and     
 Birtley Y.C., have a variety of       
 activities are provided pool, discos, 
 table tennis etc. These clubs give    
 kids a place to go at nights. There   
 are also sports clubs like swimming   
 club, football, snooker and golf      
 clubs. Most clubs are well run and    
 most have money raising events for    
 charity from time to time. St. Johns, 
 St. Jospephs, Boys Brigade, Girls     
 Brigade, Army Cadets, Round Table and 
 Rotary clubs are good leisure         
 activities.                           </content>
