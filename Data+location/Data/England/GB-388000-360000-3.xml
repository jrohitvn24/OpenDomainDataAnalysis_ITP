		<title>03Hineswood Farm</title>
		<content> Hineswood Farm is owned by Mr and Mrs 
 Birtles.The present buildings are     
 about 160 years old.Mr Birtles showed 
 us a much older building,now derelict 
 that was hundreds of years old.They   
 have lived on the farm for 36 years.  
 They own 72 acres.No crops are grown  
 on the farm.The land around the farm  
 is described by Mr Birtles as stoney. 
 It is quite hilly and much of the soil
 is clay.Mr Birtles uses fertilizers   
 but not pesticides that harm wildlife.
 He enjoys wildlife and has reserved 15
 acres to encourage animals and birds. 
 He has seen pheasants,foxes and       
 woodpeckers and has a badger set which
 he keeps secret.He keeps dead trees   
 for woodpeckers to nest in.Owls are   
 provided with a nest box.Mr nd Mrs    
 Birtles will not allow the Hunt on    
 their property.
