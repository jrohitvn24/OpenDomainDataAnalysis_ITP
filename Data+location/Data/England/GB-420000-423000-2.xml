		<content> Old  housing still  exists adjacent to
 industrial  sectors along  main  roads
 following  the  valley  bottoms.  Slum
 clearance  and  re-development schemes
 abound.  On valley  side  slopes are a
 mixture  of old  detached higher class
 housing,  post  war  estates  of semi-
 detached  houses  and farmland  mainly
 dairying.  The  interfluves  have much
 farmland often designated 'Green Belt'
 with more  modern  private and council
 housing  estates. The  patchwork quilt
 of  industry and  housing  of  various
 ages, styles and locations  along with
 small farms make the area particularly
 interesting   though  at  first  sight
 visually  unattractive.  Socially  the
 area is  deprived,  below the national
 average  in several criteria including
 a  high % in  socio- economic  classes
 III &amp; IV. In 1985 unemployment was 12%
 though part time  work is common.     </content>
