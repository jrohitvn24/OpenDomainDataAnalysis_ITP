		<title>05THE RIVER TEES</title>
		<content> The bend in the River Tees where it   
 skirts Bassleton Woods is a good      
 example of a meander.At the time of   
 our survey the tide was out and the   
 flow rate was 50 metres per minute.   
 There was evidence of earlier heavy   
 rain upriver as the river appeared    
 swollen with much debris being carried
 downriver such as tree trunks,grass,  
 branches and other flotsam.It was also
 noticed that there was little human   
 rubbish_no cartons,paper etc..We also 
 observed that it is almost certain    
 this particular section would in time 
 develop into an ox_bow lake as the    
 shape is already a well established   
 horse_shoe.The destruction of the     
 trees,by erosion,on the east bank is  
 progressing at a fast pace while on   
 the west bank the erosion is causing  
 soil slip on the higher cliff.There   
 was no indication of pollution.       </content>
