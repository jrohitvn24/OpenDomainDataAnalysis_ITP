		<content> The{church}of St.John the Baptist is  
 open early each morning until late    
 each night. It was built in the 13th  
 century and was partly rebuilt towards
 the end of the 15th century. The      
 interior was extensively restored in  
 the 19th century. An unusual feature  
 of this church is the floor which     
 slopes nearly 12 feet from west to    
 east.The oldest parts of the church   
 are the north aisle and the walls of  
 the choir and chancel.The font,nave   
 and tower are all 15th century.The    
 tower has an angel at the top of an   
 unusually twisted great arch.There are
 6 bells, 5 are dated 1705 and one is  
 1913.In the church there is a book of 
 the history of Brinklow compiled by   
 members of the local Women's          
 Institute.There is also a{chapel      
 further down Broad Street.
