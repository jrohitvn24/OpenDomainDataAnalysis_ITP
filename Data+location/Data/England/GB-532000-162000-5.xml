		<content> It was alright but we had to walk     
 miles to school,and there wasn't any  
 wellingtons or anything like that.We  
 would walk over a bridge _ the river  
 flowed underneath and when it used to 
 flood we walked through the water.When
 we got to the classroom we had to sit 
 with our feet wet all day.We had to   
 take some jam sandwiches for our      
 lunch _we had a drink of water and    
 some bread and jam for lunch and then,
 when it was all over we had to come   
 home and walk through the water again 
 'cos it hadn't subsided by then.When  
 we got home w changed, but we didn't  
 have slippers to put on so we used to 
 go bare feet.It was all cobblestones, 
 but we got used to it.
