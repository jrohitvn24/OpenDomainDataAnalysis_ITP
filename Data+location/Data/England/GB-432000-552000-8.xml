		<content>   Philadelphia is a village that grew 
 with the Industrial Revolution and    
 the Coal Industry. A number of pits   
 were located around the village but   
 the main one was the Dorothy or       
{"Dolly" Pit.}All that is left of it   
 today is the fenced off shaft which   
 now acts as a ventilation shaft for   
 the Herrington Mine.                  
   The main stores for the Northern    
 Region of the{NCB}are located here    
 along with one of the main{Engineering
{Works}none locally as "Phili-Yard".   
   Alongside this is the{Bus Depot     
 which has a repair shop and washing   
 shop for buses which serve the        
 Sunderland Area. It used to house the 
 old trams that ran to Sunderland.On   
 the main road through the village from
 Newbottle to Shiney Row there is a    
{railway crossing}for trains between   
 the pit &amp; the coke works to the south.</content>
