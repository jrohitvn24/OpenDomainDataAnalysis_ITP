		<title>02BEAFORD VILLAGE HALL</title>
		<content>   The present hall was built in 1978  
 to replace an older building which had
 been erected in the early 1920's to   
 celebrate the victory of 1919.  The   
 old hall was pulled down and the site 
 sold; a new site was donated by a     
 local farmer; a local architect       
 planned the design; and a local       
 builder did the construction.  The    
 hall committee, helped by various     
 grants, raised the Â£40,000 needed, by 
 holding fetes, revels and sales.      
   The hall is in very active use for  
 the following:- badminton, a youth    
 club, Women's Institute, occassional  
 dances and discos, whist drives,      
 sales, fetes, some Beaford Centre     
 Activities, local drama group, school 
 P.E.                                  
   The main hall is very large, with   
 adjoining kitchen/committee room,     
 store, and toilets.                   </content>
