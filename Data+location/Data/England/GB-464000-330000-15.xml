		<content>    The{Fosse Way}runs straight through
 our{Domesday}area in a Northerly      
 direction.There are five Major towns  
 on the{Fosse Way-}Lincoln, Leicester, 
 Coventry,Bath and Exeter.The Fosse Way
 starts at{Lincoln}and ends at{Exeter. 
 The{Fosse}is approximately 230 miles  
 long.There are five{Roman Stations}on 
 the Fosse Way in Nottinghamshire.One  
 near Willoughby_on_the_Wolds.One      
 between East Bridgford and Car        
 Colston.One at Brough another at      
 Littleborough and one unknown         
 one.There are no villages actually on 
 the Fosse Way.It was safer to be set  
 back from the road.                   
    The Fosse Way is known as the{A46  
 and it is a very busy road.The Fosse  
 Way is one of the few Roman roads     
 still in use.
