		<title>07BICKLEIGH CASTLE</title>
		<content> The recorded history of this property 
 begins in the Domesday Book. 35 acres 
 are now privately owned, the domain   
 and gardens covering 2.25 acres. In   
 1984 there were 17 000 visitors       
 including many parties of children.   
 The building is of local red sand-    
 stone. The gatehouse is about 500     
 years old. The farmhouse dates from   
 1650. The chapel (1090-1110) claims to
 be the oldest building in the county. 
 13 rooms are now open to the public,  
 including the first storey hall, 17m  
 long, with a narrow musicians'        
 gallery. There are interesting        
 weapons, pictures, furniture, and     
 items from the Tudor ship "Mary Rose",
 which has distant connections with    
 earlier residents of the castle. 57   
 steps and the tower top offer good    
 views. Last year local herons ate all 
 the fish in the remains of the moat.  </content>
