		<content> For many years all the villagers of   
{Farnham Common}took part in the       
 Harvest Supper. Everyone made         
 something to eat  and anyone who could
 sing,dance or recite poetry helped    
 with the entertainment. As the village
 has expanded it no longer involves    
 everyonein the village. It still      
 occurs annually but it revolves around
 the Members of the church and old     
 villagers. The newcomers don't seem to
 want to be involved.                  
                                       
{Stoke Poges}has an annual fair. It is 
 held in the grounds of Stoke Court.   
                                       
{Fulmer}still retains one of its old   
 customs. The Morris Dancers dance     
 outside the village pub on Easter     
 Monday. Any village school events also
 involve everyone in the village.
