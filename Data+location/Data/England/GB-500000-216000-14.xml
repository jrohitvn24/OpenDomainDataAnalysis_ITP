		<title>14Parish Link in Kensworth</title>
		<content> The Parish Link magazine is printed 10
 times a year.It started life 3 years  
 ago and replaced a Church Newsheet.The
 1500 copies printed cover the 3       
 villages of Studham,Kensworth &amp;       
 Whipsnade.It is completely self       
 financed;all editorial work,delivery  
 etc.is voluntary and the printing paid
 for by advertising.A correspondent    
 from each village writes their own    
 newspage,and other pages contain a    
 diary of local events,vicar's letter, 
 parish register,small private adverts,
 letters to the editor,recipes etc. Ten
 months a year the editorial team of 4 
 meets to put the magazine together.   
 After printing it is collated &amp;       
 stapled together by another team,then 
 delivered to distributors,who in turn 
 deliver a copy to each household in   
 the 3 villages.The magazine thus forms
 a 'link' between the 3 villages.      </content>
