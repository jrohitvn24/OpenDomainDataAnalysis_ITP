		<title>19A Summary of the work done.</title>
		<content>      Our area consisted mainly of Sea 
 and Coastal land with about a fifth of
 the town to the North.Of this part of 
 the town most of the buildings are    
 residential.                          
      We first investigated some of the
 prominent historical features in our  
 area which are still in existence, we 
 then worked out what amenities were   
 available to people now.In order to   
 get some idea of how people lived we  
 prepared and conducted a survey in the
 area of Seaford closest to the        
 Cuckmere.This, and our item count,    
 show that Seaford is an area for      
 retired people, and those that do     
 work, tend to work outside the town.  
      In our local news section we     
 noted two things that a large         
 number of people are concerned about, 
 namely new housing and the state of   
 the promenade.                        </content>
