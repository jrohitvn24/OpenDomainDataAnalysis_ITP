		<title>0405350178: Urban Change</title>
		<content> This is a changing area. It consists  
 largely of residential areas and light
 industrial sites. However, there are, 
 and have been for some time, plans    
 afoot to make changes but as the plans
 themselves are constantly being       
 changed nobody knows what will be     
 done, nor when. There is a great      
 shortage of amenities and services,   
 particularly for children and young   
 people. The residential areas consist 
 largely of blocks of flats which have 
 replaced the old terraces but not the 
 old community spirit. People in the   
 area are surrounded by a stark, dirty,
 deprived and desolate landscape.      
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
