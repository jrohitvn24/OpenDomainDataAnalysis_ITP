		<content> Woolton,Garston &amp; Allerton have their 
 roots in the past. Halewood, built in 
 the 60s to house Liverpool's          
 overspill, is more modern. Woolton    
 appears in the original Domesday Book 
 and has buildings that are hundreds   
 of years old. Woolton Hall was a      
 Georgian Manor House. Stone from      
 Woolton Quarry was used to build      
 the Anglican Cathedral in Liverpool.  
 Garston with its market, railways and 
 108 year old Gothic style church, is a
 mixture of old and new. Allerton Hall 
 built in the 18th Century forms the   
 centrepiece of Clarkes Gardens; with  
 the Merseyside Police College, it     
 dominates this area. Organised leisure
 plays a key part in children's lives. 
 Gymnastics, Morris Dancing, Computing,
 Keep fit, Ballet and swimming find    
 their place alongside guides, scouts, 
 brownies and cubs.       P.SWEENEY.   </content>
