		<title>15THE CATHOLIC CHURCH BURWASH</title>
		<content>    At the end of the village there is 
 a Catholic Church and compared to St. 
 Bartholomew's it is small and doesn't 
 have a tower, the roof is shaped like 
 an oval and there is a cross you can  
 see as you walk along the pathway. At 
 the back of the church there is a     
 stained glass window of Jesus.        
    Inside the church the altar is made
 of stone, it has a carved cross at    
 the front and a candle at each end of 
 the altar table. There is a Hymn Board
 that tells you where to look in your  
 hymn book and an organ to play the    
 music for the hymns.                  
    On Friday evenings lots of the     
 children come to the church to learn  
 the Catechism, we sing songs and then 
 we finish with a prayer.              
    I go to church every Sunday with   
 Stephanie, Philip, Francis and Mum it 
 is a lovely service.                  </content>
