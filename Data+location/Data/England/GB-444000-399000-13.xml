		<content> There are police stations in Swinton  
 Mexborough and Wath which deal with   
 all of the day to day events of the   
 community.  The crime rate in the area
 is quite high for a small community.  
 There is a large amount of hooliganism
 and vandalism and the main problem is 
 the shopping areas appears to be      
 shoplifting.  Recently a problem has  
 developed with glue-sniffing and drug 
 abuse which the police are working    
 hard to solve.  Police and community  
 relations have recently been strained 
 after the miners strike, but it is    
 hoped that these problems will soon be
 solved.
