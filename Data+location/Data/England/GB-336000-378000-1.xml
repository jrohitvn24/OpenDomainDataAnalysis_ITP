		<title>01  Eastham - The Place</title>
		<content>   {Eastham}started off as a small     
 village which was mentioned in{William
{the Conqueror's Domesday Book.        
    The oldest part of Eastham is the  
 church and the houses around it.      
    The A41 divides the new part of    
 Eastham from the old.                 
    Eastham is a quiet place and is    
 mainly residential with no big        
 shopping areas.                       
   {Eastham Ferry,}where ferries used  
 to take people to{Liverpool,}has been 
 blocked up with mud so now it's not   
 possible for ferries to dock.         
    The rest of the land is used for   
 farming and for oil storage depots.   
    The{Manchester Ship Canal}starts at
 Eastham and runs parallel to the{River
{Mersey}until it goes inland to        
{Manchester.
