		<content> In 1985 Crowan Village has very few   
 amenities. In{1905,}however, there    
 were three pubs and two shops that    
 sold everything. The pubs were used   
 by miners who worked at Wheal         
 Grenville and Wheal Crenver. There    
 were two schools: a boys' school      
 which was by the bridge and the       
 girls' school which is the Sunday     
 School today. The ages of the children
 that went to school ranged from       
{five to fourteen years.}Water came    
 from a spring by the bridge. There    
 was no electricity, just lamps for    
 light and a cornish range to cook     
 on. Most of the people were{miners    
 but some were{farmers.}People         
 mainly used horse and cart. The       
 blacksmith had a great deal of work.  
{The mill}was also in use.{The size}   
{of the village and its population was 
{about the same as it is today.}       </content>
