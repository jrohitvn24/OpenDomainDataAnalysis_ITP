 Yarns Ltd for short is a company that 
 operates in part of a large mill that 
 was built 100 years ago. It employs   
 325 people. Three quarters of whom    
 are men and one quarter women. Most of
 the workforce live locally in the     
 Slaithwaite area, and work between    
 22 and 60 hours a week.               
   The company produces machine        
 knitting yarns from a raw wool which  
 comes from New Zealand and Australia. 
 The wool is first dyed and colour     
 mixed and then spun and wound into    
 yarn. It then goes to customers in the
 U.S.A., New Zealand, Hong Kong and the
 U.K. In Britain big chain stores such 
 as Marks and Spencers and British Home
 Stores take much of the company's     
 products. The company has expanded by 
 40% over the last five years.
