		<title>02WOODLAND SURVEY</title>
		<content> The woodland is at grid ref 119232 on 
 the map of Alnwick and Rothbury.The   
 name of the wood is{Bilton Wood}which 
 was planted by{Capability Brown}in the
 19th Century.The plants are of a mixed
 variety mostly grasses because of the 
 shade.The trees are dominantly Beech  
 with the exception of Sycamore,Oak and
 Ash.We think that most of the trees   
 are roughly about one Century old     
 because they are very tall and thick. 
 The shrubs therefore are really quite 
 young apart from a few exceptions.The 
 varieties are Gorse,Broom,Elderberry, 
 Hawthorn and Brambles.The flowering   
 plants are the Red Campion,Nettles,Cow
 Parsley,Coltsfoot,Dock and Yarrow.The 
 non-flowering plants are quite dull   
 as they consist of lichens,moss,fern, 
 large variety of fungi and mould.
