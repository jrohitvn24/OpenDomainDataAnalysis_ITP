		<title>08GREENS NORTON PARK FARM</title>
		<content> This is the largest farm in the area  
 and is a mixed farm owned by Mr.Roger 
 Allebone.The 500 acres is divided     
 between arable land and land used for 
 the dairy herd of Freisian cattle,milk
 from which is sold direct to the Milk 
 Marketing Board.Beef production on the
 farm means that cattle are sold in the
 local markets.Mr Allebone also rents  
 another 200 acres of land for similar 
 purposes.Milking is done twice daily  
 in a milking parlour.He employs three 
 men,one of whom is in charge of the   
 dairy herd.To help him in his work he 
 has six tractors,combine harvester and
 all the usual farm machinery.He says  
 that he does not mind people using the
 Knightley Way which cuts directly     
 through his land,but is upset by horse
 riders who damage his crops.
