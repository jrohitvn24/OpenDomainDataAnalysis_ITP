		<title>12LIFE IN A RURAL COMMUNITY</title>
		<content> The people of Snelland accept the     
 drawbacks of living in an outlying    
 area with almost no public transport  
 and none of the conveniences of a     
 larger community. Parents and their   
 children travel to other areas -      
 Lincoln, Market Rasen or nearby       
 villages to take part in such         
 activities as swimming, sports, music 
 or evening education.                 
                                       
 When ambulance services were curtailed
 the villagers got together and drew up
 a rota for essential hospital visits. 
 Those with cars also take neighbours  
 shopping and on other necessary       
 outings.                              
                                       
 Villagers say that the disadvantages  
 of isolation are fully compensated by 
 the pleasures of living in the country
 away from the bustle of town life.    </content>
