		<title>04Aston Cantlow Clubs</title>
		<content>    Aston Cantlow is a village of about
 a hundred houses.It is a very quiet   
 village but there are quite a few     
 clubs there.                          
    These are some of them:            
    The Mother's Union,The Aston       
 Cantlow Working Men's Club,The Women's
 Institute,The Sunday School and the   
 Youth Club.                           
    The Youth Club was run by the      
 church but has had to close down for  
 lack of a leader.The Sunday School    
 closes for day-school's summer        
 holiday's.I started to talk to a      
 lady.She told me that her husband was 
 president of the Working Men's Club.  
    It is open every Saturday and      
 Sunday morning and has a good darts   
 team.                                 
    The W.I. is open every first       
 Tuesday of a month.It is held in the  
 village hall.                         </content>
