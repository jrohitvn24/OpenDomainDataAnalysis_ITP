    On{Thursday 13th June, 1985}me     
 and five other children went to{Mrs Hi
{rst's}house to meet her{aunt}and      
{father in law. Mrs. Carrott}was born  
 in{1905}and{Mr. Hirst}was born in     
{1906.}They were both born in{Meltham. 
 We asked how old they were when they  
 left school, they were{13}and they    
 were{5}when they started. They had no 
 school dinners but if their parents   
 worked, they took sandwiches for      
 dinner. They told us the name of the  
 first bus in{Meltham,}it was called   
 the{'Yellow Peril'.}It went from      
{Meltham}to{Lockwood}where it met the  
{trams.}There were no{trams}in{Meltham 
 because it was too steep up{Big       
{Valley.}The{train}went from{Meltham   
 to{Blackpool,}and back for{2/6d.
