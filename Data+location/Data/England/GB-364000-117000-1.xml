		<title>01A view of Milborne Port</title>
		<content>{ Milborne Port}is a village on the    
 Somerset/Dorset border.It was called  
 Milborne in the original Domesday     
 Book.The village has seen many changes
 over the past few decades.            
 We have surveyed Milborne Port and    
 have found that the majority of       
 dwellings are modern,stone-built,semi 
 detached houses.There are also a lot  
 of modern stone-built bungalows.The   
 stone used is honey coloured Cotswold 
 stone.                                
 The A30 runs through Milborne Port and
 is a very busy major road.            
 Since the first Domesday Book the     
 village hs grown to a population of   
 nearly 2500 people.                   
 It is by no means a sleepy little     
 village,there is always a lot going   
 on.
