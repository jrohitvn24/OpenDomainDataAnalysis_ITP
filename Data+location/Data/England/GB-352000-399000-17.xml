		<content>    In Billinge there many grassy areas
 for playing on, but hayfever sufferers
 would have to stay clear of them.     
 There are youth clubs in Billinge     
 which have activities. The Young      
 Ornithologists meet regularly, there  
 are cubs, brownies, scouts, guides,   
 sea cadets which hold weekly meetings.
 A karate club at Main Street old      
 school, with judo at Birchley Club.   
 Dancing classes are also held at the  
 old school.                           
  There are also public tennis courts  
 in one of the parks where the public  
 can play for nothing. The Birchley    
 Club also have football teams which   
 play in the local leagues, the club   
 also have disco's every so often.     
  Asports centre or swimming baths     
 would be an added advantage for       
 leisure, but people would come from   
 miles away and spoil the atmosphere.  </content>
