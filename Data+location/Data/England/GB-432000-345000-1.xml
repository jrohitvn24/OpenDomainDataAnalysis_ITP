		<content>{Belper}is extremely varied.There is   
 quick transition{to rural from urban  
 scenery while in the centre there is  
 juxtaposition of{commercial,industrial
{and residential}areas.The history of  
 Belper produces fascinating neighbour 
 hoods that are unique, especially the 
{conservation areas.                   
 Away from the town centre are{modern  
{residential estates}providing quiet   
 areas  of the town busy only at peak  
 periods.Inevitably the town centre is 
 much busier particularly{market days. 
 The main{A6 trunk road,}which carries 
 large amounts of lorry traffic, causes
 that part of the town to be busy for  
 most periods of the day.              
 Inspite of its industrial nature the  
 environment is{not noticeably polluted
 The central town  area is not partic_ 
 ularly interesting in terms of        
{architecture or housing.              </content>
