 St. Margaret of Antioch is the parish 
 church of Stanford_le_Hope. It is 802 
 years old. Ten years before it was    
 built four knights murdered Thomas    
 Becket in Canterbury. The church is   
 named after Saint Margaret of Antioch 
 who is the patron saint of childbirth.
 She was killed because of her trust in
 Jesus.                                
 The church was first built in 1180. A 
 north aisle was added in 1240, this   
 was enlarged in 1340. The chancel and 
 south aisle were added at the same    
 time.
