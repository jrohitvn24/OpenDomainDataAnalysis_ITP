		<content>This information was gathered through  
talks with Mrs. Audrey Osborne-Thomas  
Miss Rose Mayhew, and Mr. Charles      
Johnson- long time village residents.  
1914 the morning after the fire only   
the shell of Barton Hall was left.     
Summer holidays were extended so that  
children might help with the harvest.  
The house now an old peoples' home     
was the Dower House to the Hall.       
Where Mrs. Thomas now lives was the    
Estate Steward's House. In the village 
street was only the Post Office\Shop   
a Cycle Repair Shop and a Cobbler's.   
Mr. Johnson son of a farm horsekeeper  
who earned 6s a week, taught his father
to read and count. Mr. J. planted the  
Stud fir tree avenue. He was sometimes 
asked to wait at table at Barton Manor 
and was taught never to repeat what was
said at table and he still keeps his   
promise.                               </content>
