		<title>10WORK IN THE CLUNTON AREA</title>
		<content> The bulk of the people living within  
 the Clunton area, either are retired  
 or in farming. For the remainder work 
 means travelling to larger centres.   
 One husband and wife travel to        
 Wolverhampton every day, another works
 abroad leaving his family for long    
 periods and another comes home at     
 weekends only. For those with work    
 nearer to home Shrewsbury (30 miles)  
 is not considered too far to travel.  
 Ludlow, Craven Arms, Knighton and     
 Bishop's Castle offer openings to a   
 few. Within Clunton village there is a
 small packaging factory called Cook's 
 Choice which packs herbs and spices   
 for sale nationwide.  The firm began  
 trading in 1975 in a village near     
 Welshpool Powys. They moved in 1978 to
 Clunton where they employ 10 local    
 women and is a thriving industry.
