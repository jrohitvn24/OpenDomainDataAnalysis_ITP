		<title>17HOLCOMBE VILLAGE</title>
		<content> For many centuries Holcombe was used  
 for{hunting}by the lords of the       
 manor.Up until a few years ago it was 
 a farming community but it is now     
 mainly residential, some of the old   
 farm-buildings having been renovated  
 .The village was most active in the   
 17th. and 18th. centuries, when       
 domestic weaving supplemented         
 farming.Most of the buildings date    
 from then,and thus Holcombe is an     
 example of a pre-industrial hill-side 
 settlement. The{church}in the village 
 is built in a revived Gothic style and
 the buildings, lych-gate,             
 boundary-walls and the gravestones are
 in natural stone. The roof is made of 
 stone flag and slate.                 
  In the village there is a            
{riding-stables for the disabled.  }
