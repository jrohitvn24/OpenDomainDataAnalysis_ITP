		<content>   An interview with the Postmaster    
 dealt with the problems of the shop.  
 He is keen on the place of the small  
 shop in the local village community,  
 and is the Chairman of the Hampshire  
 Association of Village Shopkeepers.   
   He specialises to attract customers.
 Turnover is "adequate"; the opening of
 Safeways supermarket in Blandford in  
 1985 took some custom away. He took on
 the shop as a challenge, to try to    
 compete with market giants.           
    Proximity to the School brings its 
 problems: shoplifting, noise, general 
 annoyance. Pupils try to buy tobacco, 
 which is legal if they are over l6 but
 against the school rules. In fact the 
 most consistent month for takings is  
 August, when the school is on holiday.
   Post Office work is unprofitable;its
 demands ensure the Postmaster's hobby,
 computing, is used to maximum benefit.</content>
