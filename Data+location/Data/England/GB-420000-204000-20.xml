		<content>Other machinery includes ploughs,      
drills, seed harrows, trailers, culti- 
vators and corn driers.                
Changes made in farms over the past few
years include reclamation of derelict  
land (one farm had reclaimed 180 acres 
over 9 years), planting of trees and   
shrubs - hawthorn, larch, beech, oak &amp; 
pine- and drainage of land. All farmers
were unhappy that increased mechanisa- 
ion had resulted in loss of labour. On 
some farms, cottages had been allocated
to non-farming people. The owner of one
farm owns a thriving Wild Life Park and
houses his employees in farming cotta- 
ges. All complained at increased costs 
with no comparable increase in income.
