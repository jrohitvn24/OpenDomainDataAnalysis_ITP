		<content>{Farmhouses}built of local freestone   
 reflect the area's vernacular pattern.
 Many have been modernised, and grants 
 from the local authority have enabled 
 farmers and householders to re-roof,  
 new pantiles adding colour to the     
 landscape. At Mill Farm the original  
 manorial mill is now extra living     
 space. There are few unsightly sheds  
 on farms, but some existing buildings 
 have been converted to stabling. Three
 farms still retain the now obsolete   
 horse-wheel shed with a shaped roof   
 built on the threshing barn.{Faceby   
{Manor,}built 1880-90, now converted   
 into two houses, and{Faceby Vicarage, 
 now a private residence, are the only 
 houses of size.{Faceby Church,}rebuilt
 in 1874, retains a Norman arch with   
 zigzag and carved hood over the south 
 doorway.{Whorlton Church and Castle}  
 are Grade-I listed buildings.         </content>
