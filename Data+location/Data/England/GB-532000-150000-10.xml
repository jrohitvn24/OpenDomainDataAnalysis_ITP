		<content> Blechingley church is called          
 St.Mary's. It is very old and is      
 visited by many people. The vicar     
 sometimes comes to our school. The    
 steeple is quite high and very thick  
 in its lower storey. About 370 people 
 can be seated in the church as well as
 the choir.                            
   Godstone's church is called         
 St.Nicholas. It chief asset is its    
 attractive setting and its practical  
 size, nowadays put to good use by     
 internal rearrangement. There is an   
 organ in the Church which was given in
 memory of Sir Bernard Greenwell of    
 Marden Park.
