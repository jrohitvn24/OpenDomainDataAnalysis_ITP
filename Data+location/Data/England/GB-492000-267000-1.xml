 INTRODUCTION TO THE AREA.             
                                       
 This block covers the north of        
 Rushden,the west of Higham Ferrers and
 a large part of the valley of the     
 river Nene.The area is mainly farmland
 and rough pasture and about 20%       
 residential.The ground is flat and    
 forms a narrow plain covered in soils 
 of clay,alluvium and loam.The river   
 Nene is roughly 16m wide and winds    
 across its flood plain.Other water in 
 the area includes Ditchford Lake,Skew 
 Bridge Ski Club and a small lake in   
 the grounds of Knuston Hall.The town  
 of Rushden itself has a population of 
 about 26,000 with houses that         
 eventually thin out to become         
 farmland.Local farms include Grange   
 Farm,Redgate Farm,South View Farm and 
 Home Farm.                            </content>
