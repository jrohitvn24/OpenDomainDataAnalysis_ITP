		<content>{SAINT PETER'S CHURCH - LEIRE}         
 This church is mentioned in the       
 Domesday Book - "a Priest, 1085". The 
 tower is late 13th century, the       
 remainder being rebuilt in 1867 at a  
 cost of Â£2,000, when the north aisle  
 was added. The Children's Window dates
 from 1889, and was installed for Â£15, 
 raised over 5 years by pennies        
 collected from the children. The first
 recorded Rector was William de Leyre, 
 1210-1270. The current Rector of this 
 and the two other churches of Ashby   
 Parva and Dunton Bassett is Kenneth   
 Henry Bilney. The oldest grave dates  
 from 1732, commemorating John         
 Mortimore. The furthest visitor to the
 church came from the U.S.A.
