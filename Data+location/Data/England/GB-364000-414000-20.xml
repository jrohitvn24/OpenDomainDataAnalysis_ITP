		<content> A study of the{ecology}of the area    
 brings to light a variety of natural  
{vegetation.}Most of the high moors are
 covered with purple moor grass and mat
 grass with cotton sedge in the        
 wetter areas on peaty ground. Heather 
 and bilberry grow on well_drained,    
 often rocky slopes and bracken is     
 formed in large patches on the lower  
 slopes of the hills where the soil is 
 better. There is mixed,deciduous      
{woodland}at Hill Top and some tree    
 planting has been done on the         
 Rivington side of Winter Hill. Among  
 the{birds} to be found in the area are
 the mountain linnet, kestrel,red      
 grouse,short_eared  owl and grey      
 wagtail.Visiting water birds are also 
 found on Belmont reservoir. Weasels,  
 foxes and grey squirrels are among the
 local wild animals.
