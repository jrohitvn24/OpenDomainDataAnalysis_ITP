		<title>07Werrington Health Clinic</title>
		<content>The Werringto Health Clinic is situated
in Salters Lane.The mothers attend the 
clinic every 3 weeks.Most of them think
that the clinic is a good idea.Mothers 
can ask advise instead of going to the 
doctor.The health visitor visits many  
homes and examines the children in case
they are being mistreated when the     
mothers come out of hospital.The babies
are weighed and if their mothers think 
that they are ill the doctor examines  
them.                                  
  There is also an ante-natal clinic   
where many books and leaflets are      
available.Powdered milk is sold and    
also vitamin drops.The doctor keeps a  
record of everything about the baby's  
breathing and its weight.              
  About 30 - 70 people attend the      
clinic in one week. The clinic covers  
the whole area of Werrington,Blythe    
Bridge and Cheadle.                    </content>
