		<content>     Oldbury on Severn is a small quiet
 village north of Bristol in the County
 of Avon, close to the River Severn.   
 The church, rectory and school stand  
 on a small hill looking down on the   
 village. Two pubs, a post office and  
 the village's only remaining shop     
 stand at the bottom.  Some houses have
 been built ontop of a Roman Fort,     
 parts of which can still be seen.     
 There are two places of worship, the  
 church and a small Methodist Chapel.  
    There are various clubs, playing   
 fields and a village hall, all of     
 which are used regularly by the       
 villagers. Out of the village is a    
 Nuclear Power Station, the source of  
 work for some of the villagers, though
 some work at farms and others work in 
 the nearby city of Bristol.  The      
 farming is mostly dairy. Most of the  
 houses in the village are old.        </content>
