		<content>    On Friday,5th July we interviewed  
{MR COX} of{TROYTOWN FARM, PUDDLETOWN  
 about his farm.We asked him if his    
 farm was a typical Dorset farm.He     
 thought so because  his farm has dairy
 and beef cattle and arable crops.He   
 also said he thought his 900 acre farm
 was large for the area mainly because 
 it is linked to another family farm   
 in Puddletown.                        
    The soil on his land is made up of 
 sand,gravel and chalk.He grows grass, 
 wheat,barley and some kale for the    
 cows.                                 
    The machinery is typical of a      
 Dorset farm having changed little over
 recent years.                         
    He has got 110 cows and 200 young  
 stock.Eden Vale takes the milk to     
 Milborne St. Andrew and from there    
 goes to London.He produces 450 gallons
 of milk a day.                        </content>
