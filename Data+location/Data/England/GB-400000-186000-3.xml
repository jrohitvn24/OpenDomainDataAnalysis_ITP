		<title>03SOMERFORD COMMON FOX HUNTING</title>
		<content>    Somerford Common is part of what   
 was originally a large forest, Braydon
 Forest.                               
    In the past the hunting was for    
 deer, but now it is for foxes. The    
 dense undergrowth, though, does not   
 make it a good fox hunting area. The  
 hounds waste a lot of time and energy 
 with few results, and the wet, heavy  
 going causes injury to the horses.    
    The Hunt is not popular with the   
 local farmers as damage is caused to  
 the heavy ground by the hounds and    
 horses when the Hunt go over the      
 farmland.                             
    Farmers do not care for the        
 attitude taken by the Hunt as they    
 ride wherever they like, irrespective 
 of who owns the land.
