		<content> STONE MONUMENTS                       
    It seems most likely that the      
 stone monuments on Exmoor were        
 erected in the Bronze Age.People      
 think that these stones were used     
 for worship or landmarks.             
 STONE CIRCLES                         
    The present evidence shows that    
 the stone circles are usually         
 attributed to the beaker cultures.    
 The stone circles are no more than    
 a couple of feet high.                
 STANDING STONES                       
    On Exmoor and in some other        
 stoney areas you may see standing     
 stones.These are modern rubbing       
 stones for cattle,while others        
 are used more recently for boundary   
 stones.Some of these single stones,   
 however were set in place by men of   
 the Bronze Age.
