 biggest industries in the area,with   
 several training establishments       
 employing many local people.          
        The Amey Roadstone Corporation 
 has turned the local railway sidings  
 from a sleepy backwater into a noisy  
 bustling workplace.

 and Schweppes the soft drink firm are
