		<content> Thorpe is basically a small tranquil  
 village with few amenities.Thorpe     
 contains a bowling green and a        
{recreation ground}both built in 1966. 
    There is a bowling team made up of 
 local villagers.It is also used by    
 casual players.The recreation ground  
 contains see-saws,a slide and other   
 playground features.The ground was    
 built for the younger population of   
 Thorpe.The ground also contains a     
 tennis court.Football used to be a    
 popular activity.                     
      In the surrounding area there are
{two public houses}the Halfway House   
 and the Fosse Way.The former is       
 between Morton and Haddington.There is
