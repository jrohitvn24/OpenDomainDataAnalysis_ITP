		<title>09Travelling in Kirkby</title>
		<content> Kirkby as a town is quite well served 
 by transport. There is a fast local   
 train service from Kirkby to          
 Liverpool with three trains every hour
 each way. There is also an hourly     
 service to Wigan going in the opposite
 direction. In our block there are a   
 variety of regular bus services       
 which link districts of Kirkby as well
 as other places such as Liverpool and 
 Crosby. In the town centre there is   
 plenty of parking space for those with
 cars, and traffic can usually move    
 easily without the town getting       
 congested. There are also many taxis  
 in the town which are used frequently 
 by many people.
