		<title>17Carey House</title>
		<content> Carey House was opened in 1931 as a   
 convalescent home,by the Carey family 
 who were lace manufacturers in        
 Nottingham,for their workers.Now it   
 has been taken over and used for      
 D.H.S.S. patients.All 18 are from     
 Lincolnshire and stay for 2 weeks.    
 Accommodation is in ground floor rooms
 holding 2 or more people.When we were 
 there,some of the patients were having
 a rest on their beds or in the sitting
 room.For those who were awake,card    
 games,darts,snooker,jig-saws,etc.,were
 available.Others had gone out for a   
 walk or even afternoon tea.The        
 patients who were awake were eager to 
 talk to us and enjoyed our visit. One 
 lady said she wished she could join   
 the staff and stay permanently as she 
 was thoroughly enjoying herself.As we 
 left we saw wild rabbits playing on   
 the grass near the trees and flowers. </content>
