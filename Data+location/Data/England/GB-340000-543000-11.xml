		<title>11LIFE STYLE - TRAVEL &amp; HEALTH</title>
		<content> In a rural area, travel is of vital   
 importance (see ownership of cars,    
 motorcycles, etc.).  For example, we  
 surveyed the distances of family      
 doctors' surgeries: 9% of families    
 were on lists of doctors 3 miles      
 distant, 9% 4 miles distant, 9% 7     
 miles, and 9% each 10 and 12 miles    
 distant.  55% of families have to     
 travel over 6 miles to see their      
 family doctors, and as it is at       
 present the encouraged practice for   
 patients to visit the doctor at the   
 surgery, rather than the doctor the   
 patient at his home (except in an     
 emergency), the importance of         
 independent travel is doubly          
 underlined.                           
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
