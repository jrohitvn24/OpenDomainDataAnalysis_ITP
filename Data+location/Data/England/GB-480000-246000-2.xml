ONE DAY I GOT UP.THEN I GOT MY POCKET  
MONEY AND WENT TO THE PAPER SHOP.I     
BOUGHT SOME SWEETS AND A PAPER FOR     
DAD.THEN I WENT DOWN THE FIELDS WITH   
MY FRIENDS.AFTER THAT I WENT OVER THE  
RECREATION GROUND.I PLAYED ON THE      
SWINGS.AFTER THAT I WENT TO THE CHURCH 
AND PUT SOME FLOWERS ON MY BROTHERS    
GRAVE.THEN I WENT INSIDE.LATER I WENT  
FISHING IN THE BROOK.AT THE BROOK      
THERE WERE LOTS OF TREES AND I CLIMBED 
SOME OF THEM.THEN I WENT HOME AND HAD  
TEA. SOON I WENT OUT AGAIN AND PLAYED  
ON THE GREEN IT WAS QUITE MUDDY. THEN  
I PLAYED 40 40 SCAT AND HID IN THE
