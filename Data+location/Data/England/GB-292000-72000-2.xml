		<title>02HISTORY OF TEIGNMOUTH</title>
		<content> The history of Teignmouth has a lot to
 do with the sea. Saxons and Celts     
 fought a battle on the Ness which     
 sticks out like a nose or "Nez". Danes
 sailed up river and burnt huts down.  
 The French came twice. In 1690 they   
 destroyed the town. There are stories 
 about Press Gangs and a priest's hole 
 at the Jolly Sailor Inn and a         
 smugglers' tunnel at Holcombe. Jobs   
 were things like saltworking and      
 shipbuilding-some for Henry VIII.     
 Fishermen went all the way to         
 Newfoundland while their wives fished 
 at home. Next, holidaymakers came to  
 bathe and smell the sea air. Beautiful
 buildings e.g. Den Crescent and Bitton
 House were made for the rich visitors.
 In the Second World War German planes 
 tried to flatten Teignmouth-the most  
 bombed in the Southwest, for its size 
 anyway.                               </content>
