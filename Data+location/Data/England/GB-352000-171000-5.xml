 Most people think you have to go to   
 the Alps to ski but not in Bristol.In 
{Ashton Court}they have grass skiing.  
 Anyone can go young or old.Ashton     
 court also has a public golf course   
 for relaxation.It has a park where    
 you can go and play on the swings and 
 sliders.Opposite Ashton park there is 
 the Smyth Arms you can play football  
 or what ever you want on the many     
 fields surrounding the MANSION.There  
 are gardens you can go and walk round 
 and trees you can climb.There is a    
 footpath though the woods and the good
 thing is it,s all open to the public  
 for nothing.But the council want to   
 sell the land and make it a private   
 golf club or hotel.
