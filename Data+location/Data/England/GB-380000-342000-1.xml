some photographs of when our class went
to Stanley Head. It is an outdoor      
pursuits centre. We went for the day.  
ALIX...Last Christmas  we made some    
decorations.We made christmas crackers 
and and presents and hung them in the  
corridor. We made Disney               
characters,Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck   
and three little ducks. The other      
classes made other characters.         
PAUL...Iliked it when the Smoke        
Busters came to our school.Smoking is  
bad for your health.We also went to see
Pinocchio.I liked it especially when   
the audiences shouted out. I thought   
they made a "racket".                  
JOHN....At school I spilt a whole jug  
of grey paint on my school jumper.I    
had to buy another myself because      
my Mum was very annoyed.
