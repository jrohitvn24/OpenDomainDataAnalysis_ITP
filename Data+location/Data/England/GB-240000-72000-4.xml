		<content> At this time there are no schools in  
 our survey area.Most of the children  
 of primary school age attend the      
{Delaware Junior and Infant School}at  
 St. Ann's Chapel.They are picked up by
 school bus each morning and           
 returned home each afternoon. Those of
 secondary age go by school coach to   
{Callington Comprehensive              
{School,}Callington. There             
 are several children within the       
 Chilsworthy/Latchley district who     
 attend{private schools}in{Tavistock}or
{Plymouth.}There used to be a primary  
 school in Latchley but this closed    
 many years ago.The former school      
 building has been converted into a    
 very luxurious house.                 
 There is a{playgroup}for those        
 children younger than school-age and  
 this is held in the Methodist Chapel  
 in Chilsworthy.                       </content>
