 the village.Sunday morning and evening
 services are held weekly and a family 
 service monthly. The congregation is  
 mainly female and is growing. Most    
 people, especially children attend in 
 the morning.The Sunday school is being
 revived. A garden party and  a        
 Christmas fair are held annually      
 to raise funds. A monthly supper club,

 reading and a weekly Pathfinders meet.

 and his day depends on people's       
 needs.He takes school assemblies,     
 visits the sick, comforts people and  
 gives advice as well as looking after
