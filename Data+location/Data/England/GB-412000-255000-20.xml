		<title>20SOCIAL COMMENTS ON HASELOR</title>
		<content> The block allocated to Haselor J.&amp;I.  
 School is mainly arable land with some
 grassland and woodland.There are a few
 outlying dwellings but the main centre
 of population is in Haselor village.  
 Although there are many families that 
 have moved in from other areas and the
 socio-economic spread is wide there is
 a good community spirit in the village
 The Haselor Amenities Group organise  
 many activities throughout the year;a 
 Harvest Supper and Barn Dance, a Cycle
 Treasure Hunt,a Cricket Match and they
 put on the occasional concert.For the 
 past 3 years they have entered a float
 in Stratford's Carnival and walked off
 with all the prizes.With the money    
 raised they like to hold a summer     
 treat for the children and remember   
 the old people at Christmas. At the   
 school gate before and after school   
 the community spirit is fostered.     </content>
