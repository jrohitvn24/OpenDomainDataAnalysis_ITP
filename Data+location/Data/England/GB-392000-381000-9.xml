 The canal goes from Stoke-on-Trent to 
 Marple.In our area it is 5m wide      
 generally and is used mainly by narrow
 boats cruisers and speedboats.There is
 a marina which contains 107 private   
 boats,each boat paying Â£1.15p for 3   
 months mooring fee.Improvements,such  
 as painting and renewing fences,laying
 new towpaths and verges and supplying 
 new seats,have been made recently.On  
 18th May the Chairman of British      
 Waterways came to unveil a plaque to  
 celebrate the improvements. Nearby is 
 Brookbank Canoeing Centre,where people
 learn how to sail canoes and kayaks.  
 Elmwood Nature Reserve has just been  
 created close to the canal and has    
 attracted lots of wildlife.Two caravan
 and camp sites and a public house, the
 Boars Head, are used by holidaymakers.</content>
