		<content> Because this area has such{outstanding
{natural beauty}(and because this fact 
 is such an asset to many people and   
 organisations), great care is taken to
 ensure that the natural features are  
 not spoiled, and that development of  
 the area is within certain limits.    
 The area is within the{Lake District  
{National Park;}there is good access to
 open areas for visitors, and a{public 
{launching site}on Coniston Water.     
 Large{land-owners}have a great impact 
 on the landscape in this area: the    
{National Trust}owns Coniston Hall Farm
 and other sites, the{Forestry         
{Commission}owns much of the woodland  
 to the E of the lake.                 
 New development is, of course, allowed
 - under strict controls - and{planning
{permission}must in most cases be      
 obtained from the{Lake District       
{Special Planning Board.               </content>
