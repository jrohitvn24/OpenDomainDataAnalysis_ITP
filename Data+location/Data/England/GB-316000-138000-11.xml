		<content> The main centre for education in this 
 area is the new Nether Stowey VC      
 Primary School, opened in 1979. It    
 offers educational facilities for     
 children between the ages of 4 - 11   
 years. On roll are 186 children,      
 mostly from the village, but a few    
 come from the outlying communities. A 
 mini-bus collects pupils from Over    
 Stowey, whose own school amalgamated  
 with this in 1979. Teaching staff     
 consists of Head and seven full time  
 class teachers, aided by two part time
 classroom assistants. School meals are
 cooked on the premises, although at   
 least half of the children bring      
 packed lunches.Dental treatment, eye  
 and hearing tests, and speech therapy 
 are available. Pre-school children    
 attend playgroup at the village       
 hall.For secondary education most     
 pupils transfer to Bridgwater schools.</content>
