		<content>   In Autumn during the months of      
 September and October I go blackberry 
 picking up Old Hill. My mum comes with
 me and we usually cycle there. We look
 at the hedges when we go past. The    
 blackberries are black. When they     
 first come out they are red, then they
 change to black. We take a bag with us
 to put them in. Around the            
 blackberries are lots of thorns and   
 brambles, we usually get pricked. My  
 mum makes pies out of the fruit. I    
 like the mousse she does best, it is  
 very scrumptious.                     
   We find this our favourite spot to  
 go picking, but there are many other  
 hedgerows in the area where people go.
