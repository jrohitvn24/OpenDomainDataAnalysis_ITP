		<content>         Life in Upham                 
{ Lower Upham and Upham}are in the same
 community.Because the village is small
 everyone is that much friendlier.In   
 Upham there are lots of{clubs}for all 
 age groups.The church tends to be a   
 focal point for many of these clubs.  
    Indeed{Upham church}is often used. 
 As the local village school is a      
{Church of England School}they use it  
 for plays and have special services.  
 The{Sunday School}does much the same  
 thing.                                
    Upham has only one shop -{Upham    
{Stores.}This shop has only the basics:
 stationery, postal items, cigarettes, 
 newspapers, food and drink.           
    We have to go to town for clothes, 
 shoes, vegetables, toys, doctors,     
 dentists, barbers etc.                
    Upham is nice because it has no    
 modern houses.                        </content>
