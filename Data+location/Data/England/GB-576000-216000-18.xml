		<title>18What people do</title>
		<content>    Our simple survey showed that there
 are not many jobs in White Notley and 
 that most people who are at work      
 trave to their job.                   
    We found that several people work  
 in the building trade as bricklayers, 
 carpenters or as painters and         
 decorators.                           
    Some people travel to office work  
 in Chelmsford, Colchester or even in  
 London.                               
    Others work in factory jobs; some  
 of them nearby such as Silver End but 
 others much farther away such as      
 Dagenham.                             
    There are also some who work at    
 various jobs at Black Notley Hospital.
 There is a lot of concern that this   
 hospital which is the nearest to White
 Notley may soon close.                
    Unemployment does not seem to be a 
 very big problem in our area.         </content>
