 Most people interviewed shop for food 
 at big supermarkets in                
 Selby,Leeds,Crossgates,Pontefract and 
 Knottingley and buy things they run   
 out of from the local food shops.Most 
 people buy their clothes from big city
 stores like Marks and                 
 Spencers,B.H.S.,C and A,and           
 Littlewoods.There are four petrol     
 stations but most parents buy their   
 petrol outside the village.There are  
 two banks,Nat.West and Midland and    
 three building societies,the          
 Halifax,the Abbey National and the    
 Leeds and Holbeck.Many of the shops   
 tend to be mixed businesses with one  
 main line.The post office,for example 
 also sells cards,stationary,jewellry  
 and toys.The newspaper shops sell     
 toys,sweets,cigarettes and greetings  
 cards.                                </content>
