		<title>19GREETWELL QUARRY</title>
		<content>   This quarry is situated in the South
 West corner of our block. From Cherry 
 Willingham and Reepham it is hardly   
 visible but from the edge of Lincoln  
 (along  Outer  Circle  Road) it is    
 clearly a  large hole. The  site  is  
 roughly square with a side of about a 
 quarter of a kilometre in length.     
   It is not an old site in itself but 
 there have been workings in the area  
 for hundreds of  years  taking  out   
 ironstone and limestone. The workings 
 now take out limestone which we       
 think is for the foundations of roads.
   Owned by the Church Commisioners the
 quarry is commercially let although   
 the production rates and other details
 were not available. The original      
 quarry supplied stone for the nearby  
 Lincoln cathedral and Greetwell       
 church.
