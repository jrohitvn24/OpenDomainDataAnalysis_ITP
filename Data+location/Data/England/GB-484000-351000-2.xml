		<title>02Barnby in the W. Population</title>
		<content>  Approximately 90 households.         
  214  on  the  electoral  roll  ( + 52
 children).                            
  There is a general spread  across the
 whole  age  range. Most  of the  older
 residents have lived  here for most of
 their  life,  many   since  they  were
 born.Most of the younger families have
 moved into  the  village  rather  than
 having been  born here. In general the
 population is now fairly stable.      
  As there is little  employment in the
 village the  majority of people travel
 out of the village  to  work. Of those
 working in the village there  are  two
 pig farmers, a dairy farmer, a chicken
 farmer(eggs), three  arable farmers, a
 plumber and  a  craftsman who works in
 brass.                                
  Primary   school  children  travel to
 Coddington    and   secondary   school
 children  to  Balderton.              </content>
