		<title>11DRINKSTONE MILLS</title>
		<content> In Drinkstone there are two windmills.
 The Post mill, built in 1689, is the  
 oldest. The Roundhouse is brick and   
 stone. There are two common sails, two
 spring sails, and a fantail. There    
 used to be a sack sewing machine, a   
 circular saw and a reciprocating saw, 
 all worked by wind. The Postmill was  
 worked, sometimes by wind, sometimes  
 by diesel engine, until 1972.         
 There is a story that there were two  
 millers who had an argument. They both
 wanted to own the mill. So one built  
 the Smock mill for himself. The Smock 
 mill was built on the site of an      
 ancient horse mill. You can't go up   
 the Smock mill because the wood might 
 break. The sails are gone.            
 The mills have belonged to the Clover 
 family for generations. Miss Clover   
 lets us visit whenever we ask her.
