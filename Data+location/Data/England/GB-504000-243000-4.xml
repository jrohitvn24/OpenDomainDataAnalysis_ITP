		<title>04LONDON BRICK COMPANY</title>
		<content> How does London Brick make its        
 products?  Firstly it buys up the     
 agricultural land in the area.  Some  
 depth beneath the fairly good farm    
 land is a clay that is the brickmakers
 boon.  This is known as "knotts" and  
 is so good for its purpose that the   
 bricks almost make themselves.  It    
 contains oil that provides 2/3rds of  
 the of the fuel needed for firing.    
 The clay lies in layers about 50 feet 
 thick and usually a large overburden  
 of top soil and other material has to 
 be removed.  The waste is deposited in
 that part of the quarry already       
 worked.  A worked out pit may be over 
 100 acres in area and after a passage 
 of time becomes a scene of            
 devastation.                          
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
