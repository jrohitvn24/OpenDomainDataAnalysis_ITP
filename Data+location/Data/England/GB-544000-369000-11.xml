		<content>        {The Playing Field             
  The playing field was opened in 1982 
 by Mr.J.Millward who was Headmaster of
 Willoughby School until 1981.Apparatus
 was provided from funds raised by     
 locals and the land was lent for as   
 long as was necessary by J.Roughton.  
  The school has the use of it as well 
 as the general public and in return   
 the County Council Playingfields Com- 
 mittee maintain the grounds.          
           {Youth Club                 
  One of the complaints of young people
 in the villages is that there is      
 nothing to do;but there is a Youth    
 Club which is held in the village hall
 on Monday nights in the winter.It is  
 run by the Rev.A.Taylor and is for    
 10-16 year old youths.The facilities  
 are not very good e.g. the snooker    
 table cloth is torn and there is one  
 table-tennis table.Entry costs 20p.   </content>
