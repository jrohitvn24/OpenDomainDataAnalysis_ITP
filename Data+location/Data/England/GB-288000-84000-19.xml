		<title>19TOURIST VISITORS TO S DEVON</title>
		<content> The tourist plays an important part in
 the economy of the area. In visiting  
 the South West of England when        
 travelling by road, the chances are   
 that he will have travelled to the    
 county by the M5 motorway and if      
 continuing on to Cornwall will use the
 A38, or if going to Torbay or South   
 Devon he will travel on the A380 over 
 Telegraph Hill. There are two petrol  
 filling stations on the main roads who
 in the summer months must earn the    
 major part of their annual income from
 the tourist trade. These petrol       
 stations sell items such as chocolates
 and sweets in order to keep car       
 passengers happy on possibly long     
 journeys. During the winter months    
 these petrol stations rely on trade   
 from people commuting to and from     
 Exeter who choose them for convenience
 Tourism is mainly overnight stops.    </content>
