		<content>     The present fashion in hair, both 
 for men and women, is one of short    
 styles often permed, flicked and dyed.
 However there are many variations     
 within these definitions including    
 shoulder length, short cut and even   
 shaved. Hair is worn straight, in     
 curls and worn up with grips and      
 sprays.                               
    Many clothes are tight fitting with
 straight skirts and narrow ankled     
 trousers in cotton, wool, and even    
 leather. The summer clothes have been 
 dominated by pastel shades. Shoes and 
 short boots are popular in black,     
 white, red and grey.                  
   Casual wear is often still denim    
 jeans and jackets. Fashions however   
 change rapidly with shorter skirts    
 becoming popular whilst baggy clothes 
 are on the way in.
