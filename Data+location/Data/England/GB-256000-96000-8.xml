		<content>{ KNOWLE QUARRY}is in Brightley Road at
 Okehampton.The quarry begins work at  
 eight a.m and closes at five p.m.They 
 have eight people working there       
 including a secretary.They have two   
 machines.They dig up lots of          
 stones.The business began before World
 War Two.The business was begun by     
 three brothers called Colin,Terry and 
 David Barkwell.                       
  The busiest time is in the Autumn.   
 Most of the people live in            
{Okehampton.}                          
 They get the stone                    
 delivered to places where they use    
 them to make lots of different        
 things.                               
  The{by-pass}might go north and if it 
 does it will affect Knowle Quarry. The
 people working there might have to    
 find new jobs. If the by-pass goes    
 south it would save the quarry.       </content>
