   With the decline of Weston-super-   
 mare as a seaside resort and the new  
 pier, Birnbeck pier became less       
 popular.In 1933 a funfair was opened  
 on the Grand pier and so people       
 stopped using the ones on Birnbeck    
 pier.It was finally sold privately. By
 1979 the pier was threatened with     
 dosure because of the bad state it was
 in.But it was done up,only to be hit  
 by a dutch-owned pontoon causing about
 Â£700,000 worth of damage. Two new     
 supports were put in and the pier was 
 reopened to the public.In 1982 holiday
 homes were opened on the pier and     
 today holiday makers can still stay   
 there.
