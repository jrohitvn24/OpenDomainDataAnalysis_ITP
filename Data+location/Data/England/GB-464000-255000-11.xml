      Flowing ever onwards,            
      Never stopping,                  
      Flowing on its way,              
      Clear and lovely,                
      Calm and peaceful.               
        The brook.

On Thursday 13th June we went down to  
the brook.We left school at about 10.00
a.m.and returned at 12.00.The water    
flowing in the brook is very clean.    
      There are two large tunnels      
which cross the brook.Over one tunnel  
flows the canal, and over the other    
runs the railway.In some places the    
brook is deep(1m.),but in others it is 
shallow(1.5cm).I love going down the   
brook because it is very beautiful and 
peaceful and you can see a lot of      
wildlife,trees,and plants.             </content>
