		<title>10Chatteris - Fen Population</title>
		<content> The Fens have always been sparsely    
 populated, with families living in    
 isolated cottages in the middle of the
 fields.  Even if they had a horse and 
 cart, when it rained the tracks were  
 muddy so they had to walk because the 
 horse and cart would get stuck in the 
 mud.  It was a hard life and, not     
 surprisingly, the people wanted to    
 live in modern and better built       
 houses.  Gradually they have moved    
 into towns and the old cottages are   
 being demolished.  Only the larger    
 houses belonging to the farmers are   
 left.  Not many men are needed to work
 on the land now because of the use of 
 very efficient machines.  Stockmen no 
 longer need to be on hand to look     
 after the horses.  With modern        
 transport any farmworkers who are     
 needed can travel to work more easily.
