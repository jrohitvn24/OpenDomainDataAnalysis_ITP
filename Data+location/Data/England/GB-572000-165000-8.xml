The pattern of home life is rather     
varied, but approximately 40% of       
children come from broken homes.       
Many mothers work and subsequently     
there is a sharing of the domestic     
work, although the mother still does   
the majority.                          
The sharing of a meal together as a    
family is a rarity. The great majority 
of families only share a meal together 
once a week. Many meals are eaten in   
front of the T.V.                      
Many families have pets, dogs being the
most popular. About a third of homes   
have dogs.
