		<content>    On Saturday I played in my paddock.
 I couldn't play with my friend because
 she was buying a pony.  So I played   
 tennis with my mum.  Then I had a     
 barbecue (food cooked on a fire       
 outside).  I had lots of different    
 kinds of meat, then strawberries and  
 cream.                                
    I made some hideouts with my       
 sister Ruth.  Then I went on my swings
 and watched my mum on the tractor     
 cutting the grass.  My mum found a    
 fieldmouse under the tractor, but it  
 was alright.  Then I called my dad; he
 tried to find it but he trod on it and
 it died.  My mum burst into tears.    
    Then I watched telly and went to   
 bed.  I read my book and mum forgot   
 about me.  I read till 10 o'clock and 
 I nodded off to sleep.
