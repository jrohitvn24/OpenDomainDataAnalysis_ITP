		<title>01THE ALKHAM VALLEY AREA</title>
		<content>  At the centre of our area lies the   
 village of Alkham,surrounded by       
 isolated farms,cottages and to the    
 north the neighbouring hamlet of Ewell
 Minnis.The village is divided by the  
 busy B2060 Dover to Folkestone road.  
 The population of Alkham village in   
 1976 was 140 but the parish of Alkham 
 contains nearly four times this.      
  The scattered community is involved  
 with agriculture,mainly arable and    
 sheep farming.The working population  
 of Alkham is employed in Dover or     
 Folkestone but a large proportion of  
 the villagers, most of whom have lived
 there for many years,have retired.    
  Services within the village are      
 limited but villagers prefer to enjoy 
 the rural setting of Alkham in its    
 wide valley rather than move into     
 neighbouring towns.The village lies in
 a Conservation Area.                  </content>
