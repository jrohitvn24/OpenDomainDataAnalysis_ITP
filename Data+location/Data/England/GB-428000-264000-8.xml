		<title>08Guy's Cliffe, Warwick.</title>
		<content> Legend tells that it is here that Guy 
 of Warwick lived the life of a hermit,
 after having killed various monsters  
 as well as a Danish Giant. During his 
 life he is said to have married Lady  
 Felice, daughter of the  Earl of      
 Warwick in the early 10th century. A  
 short while later he went on a        
 pilgrimage to the holy land, after he 
 had himself become Earl of Warwick.   
 While he was away, Felice became a    
 nun, giving all she had to the poor.  
 Guy returned and began his life of    
 solitude in the caves.Only as he was  
 dying did Felice come to see him and  
 he died in her arms. The caves in the 
 cliffs here were the retreats of      
 hermites. There is also a ruined      
 Elizabethen mansion close by. Mr. P.  
 Morrel, a local teacher and musician  
 has written a musical version of the  
 story of the GUY OF WARWICK.          </content>
