    Most of the people who live in this
 block work in Barnstaple.The most     
 important industry in the area is     
 farming which in some parts is        
 quite intensive.None of the farms     
 are large enough to employ more than  
 one or two extra people.}Building is  
 the next most important industry  but 
 again there are no large firms and    
 most builders are either self_employed
 and work on their own or employ 2 or 3
 others.                               
    Cars are essential for getting     
 around and there is a self_employed   
 mechanic in Prixford with his own     
 workshop.There is only one post office
 and public house. Some families take  
 in visitors during the summer and     
 tourists do come to Dr.Smart's gardens
 and vist Marwood Church as well.
