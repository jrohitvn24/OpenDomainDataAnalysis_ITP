 There is a small industrial site in   
 the village.At the moment three firms 
 use the area, but it is hoped that    
 more units will be opened in the near 
 future. Exodus Travel use a large     
 building for the servicing of their   
 lorries which  take parties of        
 people on safaries in Africa. A car   
 repair workshop has been started and a
 workshop for servicing milking        
 machines has also  opened.            
 In the main street Hosiers have a     
 factory where milking machines and    
 other farm machinery are made. Because
 of E.E.C. regulations on the size of  
 milking herds part of the factory has 
 been closed down.This firm has been in
 the village for more than 30          
 years.Four years ago it  joined       
 with Milking Machine Testers another  
 village firm.                         </content>
