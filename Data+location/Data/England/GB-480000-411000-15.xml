 man arrives to moor up the ship at all

 up the river by the pilot because of  
 the danger of shifting sandbanks.Their
 cargoes are unloaded into lorries     
 which have been contracted out to the 
 owners of the cargoes.The lorries     
 first go to a local hauliers firm     
 weighbridge before going onto their   
 destination.
