		<title>09HOUSING-LOCAL SURVEY.</title>
		<content>On Thursday 23rd May 1985, we went out 
 to survey the houses in our 1km       
square.This was six streets. On        
our survey sheet we recorded,type of   
house and what they had e,g. detached  
and semi - detached,                   
and bungalows and flats; garages       
chimneys,gardens, numbers and names.   
The most popular dwellings were the    
detached   houses. I surveyed 20       
houses in the Harrowby Drive and       
 Winchester Drive area. 17 of them     
were detached,and 2 were semi-detached 
 and one was a bungalow.There  was a   
fire hydrant outside number 24. Number 
36 had a pond and a drive in and       
drive out   drive.Number 2 had window  
shutters, a greek like doorway and a   
burglar alarm. Outside the houses      
were grass verges planted with         
blossom trees.All the houses had a     
garage.None were identical..           </content>
