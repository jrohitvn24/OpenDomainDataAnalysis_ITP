		<title>12A MUSLIM GIRL IN SLOUGH</title>
		<content>     If you come to Slough after living
 in Pakistan most of your life, it's a 
 big step.  One problem is that in     
 Slough you can't read your daily      
 prayer, because of going to work.     
 Another is that Muslim girls are not  
 allowed to wear skirts, but some      
 schools make it compulsory.           
                                       
     The main problem is racialism, but
 not all people are racist.  Some      
 people joke about their colour.  The  
 thing I really dislike is when a      
 person says another is dark in colour 
 but afterwards says they would like to
 have a sun tan.                       
     Slough is a nice place to live in,
 if you've experienced a similar town  
 in England.  We have not come to      
 England to take over, only to share   
 it with English people.  That's       
 what people don't understand.         </content>
