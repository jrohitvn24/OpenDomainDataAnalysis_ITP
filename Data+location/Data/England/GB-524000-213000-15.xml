		<title>15DIGSWELL VIADUCT</title>
		<content> Near our school is a big railway      
 viaduct.It was built in 1850 so that  
 trains could cross the valley of the  
 river Mimram on their way north from  
 London.It was made of bricks made from
 local red clay but later it was       
 encased in  dark bricks  which we see 
 now.You can see some of the old bricks
 on the river bed.                     
 People said the viaduct could not be  
 built because the ground was too soggy
 and unfirm but the contractor, Thomas 
 Brassey, used lots of  navvies called 
 the'Tray Bong Boys' to dig deep       
 foundations by hand.They camped in    
 shacks on meadows where horses are now
 kept.The viaduct has forty arches and 
 the design was copied from a Roman    
 aquaduct.Intercity trains can still go
 over the viaduct at full speed so it  
 must have been well built.
