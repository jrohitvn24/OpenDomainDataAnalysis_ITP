		<title>09Smuggling in Nanjizel.</title>
		<content> It was a dark dim night with a little 
 bit of mist, perfect for smuggling. We
 turned the engine off and anchored.   
 Then we rowed ashore hoping there were
 no custom men about. We are smuggling 
 champayne. We had a 100,000 bottles of
 it. We were glad the cove was rocky   
 because we did not want anybody to    
 see us. In the morning we sold 25,000 
 bottles of it in the market. Then we  
 decided to go back to our hide-out to 
 get some more champayne. The next day 
 we sold 65,000 bottles for Â£100,000   
 the champayne that was left we drunk  
 our selves and got drunk. This time we
 were lucky, but it is dangerous being 
 a smuggler, it is only the chance of  
 big money that makes us do it at all. 
 We do not get into smuggling drugs    
 because that can harm others but there
 is no harm in a bottle of champayne.
