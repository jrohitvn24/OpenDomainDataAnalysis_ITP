		<title>04ARCHITECTURE IN CH. MINSHULL</title>
		<content> There is an interesting house by      
{Telford}near the canal(The Wharf) The 
 unusual towers on the school and      
 Bridge House were the work of Henry   
 Brooke, last of the local landowners. 
 The large{water mill}generated        
 electricity until 1954. It is now two 
 dwellings but the machinery is in     
 place. The architecture of Weaver View
 and The Homesteads is typical British 
 Town Council, with few ameliorating   
 features. However,the two new         
 buildings opposite the Badger have    
 generally been welcomed as enhancing  
 the centre of the village. Currently a
 debate is taking place about whether  
 two bungalows should be built at the  
 back of the field opposite the Church.
 The main architectural blots are the  
 Village Hall, the telephone exchange  
 and the silage tower at Village Farm, 
 shortly to be demolished.             </content>
