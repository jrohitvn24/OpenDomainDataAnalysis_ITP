		<content>    South of the{River Trent}in this   
 area there have been{gravel quarries. 
 A small amount is still obtained but  
 most of it has now been extracted. It 
 is still possible to see the piles of 
 pinkish gravel as it comes from the   
 ground and there are tall towers with 
 conveyor belts taking the gravel away.
    However the countryside is not     
 disfigured by this because when the   
 quarries were worked out in the 1960's
 a very ambitious scheme was launched. 
 The 270 acre site was used to build a 
{Watersports Centre}which was to be of 
 Olympic standard. Now it provides a   
 most important amenity for the area.
