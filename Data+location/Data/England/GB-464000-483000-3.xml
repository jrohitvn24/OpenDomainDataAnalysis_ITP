		<content> Attitudes                             
       Local people were found to be   
 very contented with life in the area. 
 They enjoy "the peaceful rural        
 atmosphere" and "friendly village     
 life". They enjoy the slow pace of    
 life and the freedom, peace and quiet 
 which the space and beauty of the     
 countryside gives.                    
       "Offcomers" (recent arrivals)   
 see the area in very similar terms and
 see the local people as being "very   
 pleasant and friendly".               
       THere is some feeling among     
 local people that "Offcommers" either 
 want "to take over" the running of    
 local affairs or that they are not    
 interested in village life.
