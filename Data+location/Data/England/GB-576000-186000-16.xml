		<content> Before my mum calls me with a cup of  
 tea in the morning,I play some games  
 on my computer in my bedroom.I have   
 cereal or toast for breakfast and then
 go to my friend John's house.He and   
 his sister walk to school with me, but
 she always goes to the newsagents to  
 get some sweets.My mum has a part_time
 job at the Post_Office and is home    
 when I return from school.My older    
 sister Penny goes to Appleton School, 
 and is home before me,but she has to  
 do a lot of homework.I go out to play 
 on my bike.I take sandwiches to school
 for lunch,but I have a big dinner when
 Dad comes home from the City where he 
 works in an insurance firm. Quite     
 often he is late because there is     
 something wrong with the trains. Then 
 he moans at Penny because she eats her
 dinner while watching TV. She likes   
 Top of the Pops especially.           </content>
