		<content>Marbles is a game and these are the    
rules. If you hit the marble you have  
it. You have a marble and someone has a
marble too. You have to hit it, but if 
it only moves a little bit it is called
'tips'. When you don't want it to carry
on rolling you ask for 'stops'. If the 
person has to go in and then does not  
bring it back out with him or her they 
have to go and fetch it and give it to 
you. When you have lost, if you don't  
think that you lost fairly then you    
play the game again. If a shot is taken
unfairly  it has to be taken again.    
When you want to finish a game and get 
your lunch or something, you give the  
person another marble in assurance that
you will play the game again after.
