		<content> Most households have a vacuum cleaner,
 washing machine, fridge and freezer.  
 Electricity, oil, solid fuel and      
 bottle gas are used for cooking and   
 heating. Many homes have central      
 heating but retain the traditional    
 open coal fire. Pressure cookers, food
 mixers and processors and microwave   
 ovens are widely used for home cooking
 and baking. Jam, chutney and wine are 
 made from home grown produce.         
                                       
 Home-based crafts include knitting,   
 sewing, spinning, weaving, wood-      
 turning and walking stick making.     
 Television viewing (live and video),  
 the playing of radio, tapes and       
 records and reading are popular       
 leisure pursuits in most homes. The   
 County Library van, based on          
 Workington (48km) circulates in the   
 area every three weeks.               </content>
