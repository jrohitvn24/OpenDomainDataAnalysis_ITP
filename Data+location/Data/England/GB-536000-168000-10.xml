 station ,two roads and a small area of
 Beckenham and also a public house.All 
 of them get their name from a farm    
 that used to be found down Kent House 
 Lane.This can be traced back to 1240  
 and was the oldest house in Kent until
 it was knocked down.It was called Kent
 House because it was the first house  
 in Kent.Nearby in Stumps Hill Lane    
 there was an old brick works which    
 made bricks from the clay mined at the
 clay pit there.In 1503 a murder took  
 place at Kent House and a ghost       
 haunted the house.Mary Tudor visited  
 the area ,riding up Copers Cope Road, 
 which in those days was called Coopers
 Clot.She visited some famous cherry   
 orchards there.
