		<content> OLDER PEOPLE _ THEIR THOUGHTS :       
      We spoke to a number of older,   
 retired people who live in the        
 village.Many of them live in special  
 bungalows and flats provided by the   
 council.                              
      They preffered the area before   
 all the new estates were built.They   
 don't like the noise and behaviour of 
 some of the children when they play   
 near their houses. They hope the      
 children get a proper play area       
 supplied by the council.(The children 
 have presented a petition to their    
 local councillors).                   
      All pensioners say they rely on  
 the small local post office situated  
 in a small shop called "The Cabin"to  
 collect their pensions-they hope it is
 never closed.They say there is to much
 crime in the area,and they feel longer
 sentances should be given.            </content>
