		<title>05THE RIVER KENNET</title>
		<content> The{Kennet}is a manmade river and the 
 flow is now controlled by four sluice 
 gates which the river baliff, John    
 Hounslow, is in charge of.It is at    
 least 500 years old,and may even be   
 Roman.The source of the river is at   
 Broad Hinton and it joins the Thames  
 at Kingston.No boats are allowed  on  
 the Kennet and it never freezes       
 over.People pay to fish in the        
 river.On our survey of the river we   
 found several kinds of plant including
 water crowfoot,water starwart,        
 canadian pondweed and watercress.We   
 also found shrimps, mayfly nymphs,    
 caddisfly larvae, leeches,water_rats  
 and coots.The speed is 130cm per      
 second at its fastest point,and its   
 temperature on the day of the survey  
 was 13 degrees C.Its pH is 7.It is    
 27cm and 178cm deep and is 12.1m wide 
 here.                                 </content>
