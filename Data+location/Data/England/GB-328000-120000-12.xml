		<content>   Fish in the Net _ one person is "on 
 it" and that person is the net and the
 rest of the players are the fish. The 
 fish have to run from one end of the  
 room to the other without being       
 caught. If they are caught they join  
 hands with the net and help it. The   
 net has to keep its hands joined;if it
 breaks hands all the fish who are in  
 the net become free and you start the 
 game again.                           
   Baked Beans _ one person is the     
 caller and the rest of the players    
 walk round in a circle. The caller    
 calls out the name of a bean like     
 "broad bean". Then the players have to
 make themselves fat. "French bean"    
 means they have to act posh.  At the  
 call "baked beans",everybody runs.    
 Those who are caught by the caller are
 out.                                  
                                       </content>
