		<title>01NORTH OF CLACTON</title>
		<content>  This area, which we have been        
 investigating is just south of{Weeley}
 and north of{Clacton.}It mainly       
 consists of{arable}fields and farm    
 buildings.                            
  There is one village to the east of  
 the block. This is called{Weeley Heath
{.}It is made up of a large housing    
 estate, a garage, a public house, a   
 post office and a{Methodist Church.}  
 The main{Colchester-Clacton}road      
 passes through the centre of this     
 village.                              
  Also the main{Colchester-Clacton}rail
 line runs through the north of the    
 block.                                
  The area is mainly inhabited by      
 elderly people, most of whom are      
 retired, and people interested in the 
 agricultural side of life. It is also 
 said to be a relatively cheap place to
 live.                                 </content>
