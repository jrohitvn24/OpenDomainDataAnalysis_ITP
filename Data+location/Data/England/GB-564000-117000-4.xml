		<content> The Dallington Church is called       
 ST.Giles.It stands about 200 yards    
 from the windmill.The Dallington      
 district is a deanery,probably the    
 oldest and is consequently the mother 
 church of the neighbourhood.The oldest
 part of the church is its rare        
 steeple.Only 3 other churches have one
 in sussex.In the 12th century the     
 church of ST.Margaret at Dallington   
 was mentioned in a Hastings Priory    
 Charter. It was rebuilt by Sir Thomas 
 Hope in the 14th century.One of the   
 merlons on the tower has a plain cross
 on a shield and ST.Margaret always    
 carried a cross to defeat the devil.  
 The suggestteddate of the tower and   
 spire is 1470. Thepresent church was  
 probably built by the Pelham family   
 during the 15th century the Pelham    
 Buckle can be seen on the two         
 outermost merlons of the tower.       </content>
