		<content> Affectionately known as the "Tin      
 Tabernacle" the{Church of England     
 church is a small mission hut, yet    
 people are always surprised how       
 splendid it is inside with wooden     
 panelling and an attractive altar.    
 Services which are held weekly are    
 conducted by the vicar who lives in   
 Hanbury. There is a junior choir who  
 lead the family services and also     
 perform excellent musical             
 entertainment e.g. at the Harvest     
 Suppper.                              
                                       
 On Rogation Sunday the congregation   
 are led outside by the vicar to bless 
 the fields. At Christmas time a very  
 large tree is lit during a special    
 open air service. During Christmas the
 tree is a very cheering sight to      
 motorists coming down the cliff on    
 their way home from work.             </content>
