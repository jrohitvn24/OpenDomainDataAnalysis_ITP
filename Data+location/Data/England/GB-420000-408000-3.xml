		<title>03Changing Methodist attitudes</title>
		<content> Since Wesley's day Methodism has      
 exerted strong influence in the area  
 both morally and politically. General 
 Booth was converted in Skelmanthorpe. 
 There are two Wesleyan Reform Union   
 churches. The Denby Dale circuit has  
 4{chapels}in this area and two        
 ministers preach in the circuit       
 supported by lay preachers.           
 Congregations are generally falling   
 and no new churches are being built in
 the area. Several have closed or      
 amalgamated in modernised buildings.  
 Many chapels remain very active with  
 Sunday Schools and other activities   
 such as play and youth groups. Most   
 congregations are of older people but 
 some chapels have succeeded in        
 attracting whole families. Local      
 people feel that more needs to be done
 to attract people, if Methodism is to 
 survive in these villages.            </content>
