		<content> The only military land cover in this  
 area is an army storage unit. However,
 the air space is regularly used by the
 aircraft of both the R.A.F. and the   
 Army. Jets, light aircraft, gliders,  
 helicopters and barrage balloons are  
 quite common sights. Military         
 personnel of all ranks purchase their 
 own homes here as both R.A.F.         
 Catterick and the Army garrison are   
 only a short journey away. A three    
 year posting seems to be the norm in  
 forces life and this means that there 
 is a constant changing of the         
 population and if a complete regiment 
 is posted abroad the property market  
 is flooded with houses for sale or to 
 let. All this has an unsettling effect
 on the community, particularly in the 
 schools as it tends to disrupt class  
 project work.
