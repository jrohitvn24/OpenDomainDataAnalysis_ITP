		<title>19ITCHEN NAVIGATION CANAL</title>
		<content> Romans were first to use the river for
 carrying building materials on barges.
 1795 Barton river was repaired and    
 locks constructed.Barges carrying coal
 were pulled by horses walking on      
 towpaths.When the barges went under   
 bridges the horses were led round the 
 side.The men on the boat put there    
 feet on the side of the tunnel and    
 pushed themselves along.These men were
 called leggers and the bargees.Bargees
 could not be press ganged into the    
 navy because they had a certificate   
 from the mayor.6 barges usually went  
 up at any one time.1867 the canal was 
 no longer used for traffic.1869 the   
 last barge of coal went up the canal  
 because steam engines had taken       
 over.Vibration from the engine        
 destroyed locks.tthe railway was      
 responsible for payment.Today it is   
 used for fishing and ecology etc.     </content>
