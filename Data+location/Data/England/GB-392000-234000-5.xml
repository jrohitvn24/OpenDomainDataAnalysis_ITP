		<content> Quite a lot of mills in the district  
 are on a stream named the{Squitter    
{Brook}.It flows into our area at      
{Robins Mill}.This brook was never very
 big but it carried a lot of water in  
 the past so they built a lot of mills 
 which had a mill pond.All the mills   
 along the Squitter are corn mills.In  
 past times these mills were used      
 locally and farmers had their corn    
 ground and then sold the flour.The    
 mills along the  brook are{Robins,    
{Upper &amp; Lower Kemerton and Aston      
{Mills}.None of these work any more ,  
 Aston Mill is in a bad state,and Lower
 Mill was gutted in the 1930s .Today   
 there isn't as much water in the      
 stream because it's extracted upstream
 in{Overbury}for{drinking water}so if  
 any mills were working they would be  
 able only to do half as much work.On  
 the Carrant is Northway Mill.         </content>
