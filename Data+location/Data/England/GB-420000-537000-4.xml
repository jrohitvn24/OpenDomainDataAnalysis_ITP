		<title>04THE PEOPLE OF BRANDON</title>
		<content> Over 100 people were interviewed about
 their opinions of Brandon today. They 
 had either lived here all their lives 
 or moved here because of work or      
 marriage.Most liked the area and      
 thought facilities for all ages       
 adequate.However the younger ones did 
 not think they have enough facilities.
 All agreed that once the sports centre
 was completed in October 1985,        
 facilities would greatly improve,but  
 many wished the centre had included a 
 swimming pool.Most shopped for food at
 the "Co-op", for clothes in Durham,and
 for larger items in Durham or         
 Newcastle.They thought the biggest    
 changes they had seen were the closing
 of the coal mines,closing of the      
 station and thus the disappearance of 
 the railway line, and the growth of   
 new housing estates.
