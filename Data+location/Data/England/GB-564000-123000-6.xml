		<title>06THE CHILDREN'S REC.</title>
		<content>    The Rec. is the place I like most  
 in Burwash, not because of the fancy  
 things like slides and swings but     
 because there are secret places like  
 little huts called 'camps'. One is    
 very difficult to locate and this one 
 is known as 'Hard Camp'. The others   
 are called Bell, Brick, Tree, See-saw 
 and Sugar-cane camps. You can do any- 
 thing in a 'camp'and no grown-ups know
 where you are.                        
    The Rec. is connected to fields by 
 passing through a gate, down the lane 
 is a house where Alexander lives and  
 next the Fire Station comes into view.
 To the west you head back towards the 
 village, while to the north you head  
 into another field that is surrounded 
 by a wood, this is a marshy area with 
 a stream running through it. To the   
 east a row of trees leads to more farm
 land and a farm house.                </content>
