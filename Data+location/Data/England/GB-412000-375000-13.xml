  On my way home from school,I pass the
 Horse and Jockey which is the public  
 house that owns the land on which I   
 graze my donkey.I take Murfi, the     
 donkey, down to my house and put her  
 in the stable after bedding her down  
 and feeding her, then I go and have my
 tea.                                  
  After tea I change and feed the hens.
 I then collect the eggs;we usually    
 get two to four eggs a day.When I have
 fed the hens I feed the ferrets.I have
 two ferrets called Snowball and       
 Sweetpea. Sweetpea has had three young
 ferrets.She would have had more but   
 she is only a small ferret.After that 
 I feed the cat then I take our dogs a 
 walk.When I have taken the dogs,      
 Rachel and I go riding on Murfi.Some  
 times I help my brother Simon feed his
 pigeons but not very often.           </content>
