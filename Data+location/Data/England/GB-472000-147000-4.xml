		<content> MOST OF THE EDUCATION IN OUR AREA     
 TAKES PLACE IN OUR SCHOOL BECAUSE     
 THERE ARE NO OTHER SCHOOLS IN OUR     
 AREA. OUR SCHOOL IS A SMALL VILLAGE   
 SCHOOL AND THE BUILDING IS ABOUT 75   
 YEARS OLD. THE SCHOOL BUILDING USED TO
 BE THE LORD WANDSWORTH PRIVATE SCHOOL 
 FOR POOR CHILDREN BUT NOW THAT IS MUCH
 BIGGER AND FURTHER UP THE ROAD, AND   
 THE LORD WANDSWORTH TRUST SOLD THE    
 SCHOOL TO THE HAMPSHIRE COUNTY        
 COUNCIL.THERE WAS ANOTHER SCHOOL IN   
 OUR AREA AT SOUTH WARNBOROUGH,BUT THAT
 CLOSED AND THE CHILDREN CAME TO OUR   
 SCHOOL. THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN IN     
 OUR SCHOOL IS BECOMING LESS AND LESS  
 BECAUSE THERE IS NOT MUCH NEW BUILDING
 AND MANY OF THE PEOPLE NOW LIVING IN  
 THE AREA GO TO PRIVATE SCHOOLS.IN OUR 
 SCHOOL WE DO ALL THE NORMAL SORTS OF  
 LESSONS AND GAMES.WE HAVE A HEADMASTER
 AND THREE LADY TEACHERS.              </content>
