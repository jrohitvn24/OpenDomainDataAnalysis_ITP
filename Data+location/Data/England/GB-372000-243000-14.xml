 to host a womens institute_,this is a{
{badminton club}which takes place twice
 a week.There is also a {tennis club}  
 which was started in 1980.They pay a  
 peppercorn rent to Mr Phipps for the  
 land on which the courts have been    
 made.                                 
   There was a football team till 1983 
 when it stopped due probably to the   
 lack of players.                      
   There is no young farmers club and  
 the scout group was disbanded a few   
 years ago on the retirement of its    
 leader.There are discos in the Hall   
 from time to time.
