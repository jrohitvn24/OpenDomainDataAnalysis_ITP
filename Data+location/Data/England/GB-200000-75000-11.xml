		<content>{SKILLS.}Because of the remote nature  
 of our area, and a relatively         
 unchanging pattern of life, many local
 traditions have survived. Some of     
 these are inherited skills which are  
 unlikely to continue to the next      
 generation since the skills themselves
 are not being practised. These include
 ploughing with horses,thatching and   
 sowing fields by hand. Skills which   
 have endured are dairy products made  
 by hand,hand-milking,Cornish pasty    
 making,bee-keeping,spinning,welding   
 and Cornish stone-hedging.            
{DIALECT WORDS.}Local people grew up   
 with many dialect words but only use  
 them with intimates. As the words are 
 only spoken, no-one is sure of their  
 correct spelling and the absence of a 
 written record makes their survival   
 uncertain.The following table gives   
 some indication of their meanings.    </content>
