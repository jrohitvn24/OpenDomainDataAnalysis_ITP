		<title>03Sor Brook :Banbury</title>
		<content>Sor Brook starts at a weir about half  
a kilometre north-west of Wykham Lane. 
It is about {6.4 kilometres long}. It  
supplies the moat of {Broughton Castle}
and then goes under the Tadmarton Road 
and along to {Wykham Mill}. It then    
goes under Bloxham Road to a weir      
where it ends. There are three drains  
from the moat, they join up make Sor   
Brook again. There are a few crop      
fields beside the brook but mostly     
they are hay and grazing fields. The   
brook runs in a South-Easterly         
direction. It ends just south of       
Wykham Park. It is {three to five      
metres wide}. The farms it passes are  
Wykham Mill Farm, Castle Farm, Ells    
Farm, Fulling Mill Farm and Broughton  
Grounds Farm. The brook used to power  
Wykham Mill. The brook finally runs    
into the {River Cherwell}.
