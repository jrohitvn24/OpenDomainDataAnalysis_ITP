		<title>03LIFESTYLES VILLAGE PUB</title>
		<content> The New Inn is an early Victorian     
 building.As late as 1943 it was only  
 an ale house attached to the village  
 shop and bakery but it now has a      
 spirit licence and also provides the  
 cooked meals expected by today's      
 customers.A microwave oven is used for
 heating the food quickly but not for  
 the initial cooking.Other facilities  
 include a large car park and chairs   
 under umbrellas in the garden,a bar   
 billiard table,a dart board,two       
 electronic games and a cigarette      
 machine.                              
 At lunch time on Tuesday 16th July    
 there was only one couple(retired)from
 Winterbourne itself.The older people  
 who used to come in every night       
 expecting their own seats and tankards
 have been driven out by the changed   
 atmosphere.Most customers now come by 
 car from neighbouring towns.          </content>
