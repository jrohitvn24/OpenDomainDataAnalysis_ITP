		<content> THE FUN RUN by David Buckle           
  The Fun Run was held for the first   
 time in Claybrooke . It is hoped to be
 an annual event. It was 6Kms long. We 
 all lined up ready to start and set   
 off at 12.00 from the school. 93      
 competitors took part.We left         
 Claybooke Parva, went past Ullesthorpe
 Court, the Scout Hut,and in to        
 Claybrooke Magna. I finished          
 half-an-hour later on the school      
 field. We all received a plaque and a 
 certificate to show we had finished   
 the race.                             
 BRAINSTRAIN QUIZ COMPETITION (first   
 ever) was organised by Lutterworth    
 Independent Newspaper. A team of 3    
 residents from Claybrooke Magna       
 reached the grand final and won the   
 Challenge Trophy.
