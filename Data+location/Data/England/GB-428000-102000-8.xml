		<title>08Badgers</title>
		<content> Brockenhurst is famous for badgers and
 the symbol of both the village and the
 local primary school is a badger.     
 Badgers have faces which are white    
 with a broad black stripe on each     
 side. the rest of their fur looks grey
 but is really made up of black and    
 white banded hairs. The underneath    
 part of their body is black.As they   
 usually go out only at night they are 
 very difficult to see except for their
 faces.They live in underground tunnels
 called setts,which they dig out of the
 ground.They always use a tree near the
 entrance to clean their claws and you 
 can sometimes find these scratched    
 trees.They build a great many passages
 in their setts and the rooms have air 
 holes to ventilate them.Badgers are   
 very clean and change their bedding 2 
 or 3 times a year.Badgers are short   
 sighted but have acute sense of smell.</content>
