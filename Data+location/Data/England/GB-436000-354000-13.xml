		<content> Our area provides very little         
 full-time employment so most people   
 have to travel to their place of work.
 Within the area a small number of men 
 work on farms, at a garage which also 
 sells cars, at a tyre retailers and at
 Taylor's Mill. Some women work        
 part-time at local pubs and at the    
 village school.
