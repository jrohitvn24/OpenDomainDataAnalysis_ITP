		<title>11DARLEY DALE</title>
		<content>   Darley Dale covers roughly half a   
 square kilometre of land.It is centred
 upon the A6 road surrounded by the    
 hills and dales of Derbyshire.        
   The village has a number of shops,  
 including butchers,grocers,a hair     
 salon and newsagents.                 
   To the west of the village lies     
 St.Helens Church which was built in   
 1539 and stands next to a thousand    
 year old Yew tree,planted in Roman    
 times.                                
   Just outside the village is         
 Stancliffe Hall Preparatory school    
 which has 35 acres of land on which   
 many activities take place.           
   Much of the area to the north of    
 Darley Dale is taken up by the        
 Stancliffe Quarry which produces much 
 of the sand stone required for        
 building in the area.
