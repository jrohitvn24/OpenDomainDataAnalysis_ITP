		<title>15LANDCOVER</title>
		<content>      The primary land-cover in our    
 area is grassland and farmland. Much  
 of the land in this area is farmland  
 owned by a group of people, but       
 tenanted out to farmers.              
      The secondry land-cover in our   
 area are woods. Most of the trees are 
 around Hazlegrove House School, in    
 Yarcombe Wood and Forty Acre Copse,   
 but there are also many other trees.  
      The tertiary land-cover          
 here are buildings. These are very    
 scattered except for in Babcary and at
 Hazlegrove, although the amount of    
 land covered by buildings are far     
 behind grassland.                     
      Babcary is quite a small village 
 and the main factor why there are no  
 new houses is the fact that there is  
 no mains drainage,and the villlage    
 will not really start to expand until 
 there is mains drainage available.    </content>
