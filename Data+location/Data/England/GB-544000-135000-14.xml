		<title>14A day in my life</title>
		<content>   At 7 o'clock get up.I wash and clean
 my teeth,then get dressed. I have my  
 hair done and go downstairs for       
 breakfast.I have cereal and toast. I  
 pack my bag and put my coat on and go 
 to school by car.School opens at 8.55 
 a.m. We have assembly first in the    
 school hall during which we hear a    
 story and sing a hymn.                
   Then we have English and French.We  
 go out to play for 15 mins. The       
 teacher on duty claps her hands and we
 go in for maths. The infants go in    
 first.At noon we eat our dinner in the
 hall.This is followed by 30 mins play.
 We either have art,history,science or 
 games,sometimes music. We go home at  
 3.20 p.m.                             
   When I get home I change and ride my
 pony for an hour.I put him to bed and 
 help my mummy with the tea. I read or 
 watch television  and go to bed.      </content>
