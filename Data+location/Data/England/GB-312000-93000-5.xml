		<content>   During the research for this block  
 several local people were interviewed.
 The overwhelming impression one is    
 left with is of a caring and friendly 
 group of people.  One man worked in   
 the past at the now disused rubbish   
 tip above Lower Knapp Farm (154956).  
 He had seen many changes in the       
 Roncombe valley. He had worked on the 
 many of the farms in the valley and   
 explained how in 1939 17 men were     
 employed in the Roncombe. He obviously
 has a great respect for the area and  
 spoke with some sadness about how much
 of the beauty of the Roncombe had been
 lost during his lifetime.
