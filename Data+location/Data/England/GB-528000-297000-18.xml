		<content> The area known as the Fens have always
 been a noted haven of skaters.In the  
 past, when winter freezes seemed more 
 servere than now, the Fens had large  
 areas of fen and flooded land that    
 froze solid.Even in later years when  
 the Fens were being drained, the long 
 straight drainage canals - or dykes - 
 froze solid. Then skating made a      
 sensible form of progress, and the fen
 people would skate long distances     
 along these frozen pathways.          
    As most people skated, races were  
 popular. These were both speed races  
 and extremely long distance           
 matches.Whittlesey, the town on the   
 edge of our grid, even gave its name  
 to the forerunner of the modern racing
 skate - the Whittlesey runner.        
    Today, the ice rink at Peterborough
 flourishes,but areas of the fens are  
 still used for traditional fen skating</content>
