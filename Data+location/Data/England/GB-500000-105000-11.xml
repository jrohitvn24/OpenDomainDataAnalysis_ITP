		<content> Our farm is called New Barn farm. It  
 is a mixed type farm. We have about   
 150 pheasants for breeding, the babies
 are out in the Autumn. There are      
 groups of woods dotted about. It is   
 very quiet and hardly anything goes   
 on. The roads are very narrow.        
 We live in an old school house next to
 the church. The church is full of bats
 in the belfry and the vestry. I sleep 
 in a room which was added on to the   
 old school, it has a polished wooden  
 floor. There was one big school room, 
 all the other rooms were teachers'    
 rooms. We have two open fireplaces.   
 There is a well in the dining room and
 one outside and a toilet in the       
 garden. There are many stray cats from
 the woods.
