		<title>07Yattendon School</title>
		<content>   Yattendon School is a Church of     
 England (Aided) School. This means    
 that the Rector, who lives next door, 
 comes in every Monday morning to take 
 our Assembly.  We also go to the      
 church twice a term for services.     
   Everyone studies Religious Education
 though it's not just about the Bible. 
  We learn about things going on in the
 world, wars and famines and why some  
 countries which are rich and well-fed 
 can't seem to help the poor and       
 starving ones.                        
  There are 44 children at school      
 between the ages of five and eleven.  
  There are two full-time teachers and 
 one half-time.  The Headteacher lives 
 in Curridge and the Infant teacher in 
 Ashmore Green.  The part=time teacher 
 lives in the School house, but this is
 only until her new house in Newbury   
 has been built.                       </content>
