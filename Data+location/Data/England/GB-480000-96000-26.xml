East Wittering Primary School is a sixteen roomed school including; eight fabulous classrooms, a child friendly kitchen, an incredible library, an SEN room and an ICT suite. &lt;br />&lt;br />Mrs Parker, our Head Teacher, is in charge of eight teachers and a fantastic team of LSAs.  There is a bursar and three members of office staff.  All the adults who work at East Wittering school are extremely kind and helpful.  We take part in a huge range of lessons and activities and recently our school has introduced Big Maths and Big Writing. &lt;br />&lt;br />We have eleven supportive governors and 'The Friends' who are a group of parents who organise fundraising events such as the Christams and Summer Fair.   &lt;br />
