		<title>10HEALTH IN TIDWORTH</title>
		<content>  Due to the military population of    
 Tidworth we have Army medical services
 as well as the National Health        
 Service. The NHS provides a doctors'  
 surgery at the Community Centre and a 
 Health Centre on Station Road. Child  
 Health Clinics are held regularly at  
 Ordnance House. The Royal Army Medical
 Corps (RAMC) runs a group practice at 
 St. Andrews Road and the Medical      
 Reception Station (MRS) at Jamrud     
 Road. The MRS gives 'out-of-hours'    
 emergency cover. The dependants of    
 military personnel may choose to be   
 treated under the NHS or RAMC. Dental 
 Clinics are run by the Army and there 
 is a civilian dentist on Pennings Road
 (A338). Hampshire County Council also 
 runs a school dental service and      
 schoolchildren are given free         
 treatment if required. Civilians are  
 treated by the National Health Service</content>
