		<content> The Holegate part of Halton Holegate  
 comes from the 'Hollowgate'. There is 
 a deep cutting in the sandstone and   
 the road to Firsby runs through the   
 gap.A wooden footbridge linked the    
 Rectory and the Church. Older people  
 in the village leave out the "e" in   
 Holegate and spell it Holgate.        
 Northorpe Road which leaves the       
 village to the north took its name    
 from the original name of the village.
 This shows the influence of the Danes 
 in the area, as does Spilsby, the name
 of the small market town in the north 
 west corner of our area.              
 Our school stands in Station Road.    
 Beverley House where Mr. Clough lives 
 gets its name from the fact that this 
 house and some land in Halton was     
 owned by the Beverley Grammar School. 
 Peasgate Lane: originally all the     
 roads leaving the villages were gates.</content>
