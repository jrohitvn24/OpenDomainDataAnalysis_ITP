		<content> Main sources of employment are the 17 
 farms mostly run by family labour, and
 ancillary industries such as          
 agricultural engineering and implement
 repairers in Tiverton. A few local men
 are agricultural contractors. The wood
 yard employed 12 until mid-August 1985
 when four men were made redundant.    
 Many drive daily to Tiverton or Exeter
 and work for the County or District   
 Councils or private concerns. Two men 
 have  their own motor-repair business 
 in Pennymoor.                         
 The broiler unit employs a resident   
 manager plus one assistant.           
 Contractors are hired to clean out the
 buildings. The Cruwys Arms public     
 house employs one regular cleaner, one
 cook and casual bar staff. There are a
 few retired people and a small number 
 of unemployed. Labour relations are   
 good.                                 </content>
