		<content>The Staffordshire side of the area has 
both a Church and a Village Hall in    
different parts of Mayfield for use by 
Clubs.  There is a playgroup, a Brownie
Pack and a Womens Institute.  Men have 
a Tug-of-War team and the Mens         
Institute, also a social games club -  
with its own hall for billiards.       
  The Ladies Group is an informal      
social gathering and there is also a   
Senior Social Club.                    
  The Church runs a Mothers and Tots   
Club, a Church Youth Club for the 10-12
year olds and the Church Women's       
Fellowship, once called the Mothers    
Union.                                 
  The well known trout fishing on the  
River Dove is let to about four        
different clubs.  These are privately  
run and attract both local members and 
fishermen from further away.
