		<content> The area is mainly agricultural and   
 predominantly arable,with the chief   
 crops being wheat,barley and          
 potatoes.Vegetables which can be sold 
 locally and from farm shops form the  
 majority of the remaining crops.The   
 largest settlement is the village of  
 Orsett.This is now a residential      
 dormitory for the Grays area.It is    
 also the site of the Orsett General   
 Hospital which serves Thurrock.It also
 has its own school,post office,shop   
 and village hall.                     
 The Orsett Cock,a public house and    
 road junction which has caused        
 considerable hold ups in the past now 
 enjoys peace and quiet as the new     
 extension of the A13 opened 27th June 
 1985 passes underneath the roundabout 
 and runs on eastwards to Stanford-le- 
 Hope.In the southern part of the area 
 are a number of gravel pits.          </content>
