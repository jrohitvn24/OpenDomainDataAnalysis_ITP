		<title>15KING GEORGE DOCK, HULL</title>
		<content> Hull's largest deep water dock.       
 This dock and its extension, Queen    
 Elizabeth Dock are used by ocean going
 liners and large freighters. The dock 
 has recently been modernised at a cost
 of Â£15 million and now provides new,  
 deeper berths and a range of modern   
 cranes, transit sheds and new roads.  
  Unfortunately, business in the dock, 
 and the port as a whole, has declined 
 The{Unions}have refused to work as the
 owners wanted and the{Owners}have     
 charged the customers high fees. The  
{Customers}have taken their business   
 to non union inland berths.           
  Most ot the remaining business is    
 handling goods transported in         
 containers, North Sea Ferries and the 
 bulk handling of grain. None of these 
 employ much of the dock's capabilities
 or labour force.Thus the dock stands  
 largely empty.                        </content>
