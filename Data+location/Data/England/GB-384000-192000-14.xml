		<content> The only main road in the area is the 
 A.4135 which links Tetbury to the     
 A.46.There are a number of minor      
 roads.The narrow Hookshouse Lane winds
 its way from the outskirts of Tetbury 
 to the village of Leighterton via the 
 hamlet of Hookshouse.Another lane runs
 north from grid.ref.880932 and leads  
 to the ancient Chavenage House.A      
 number of routeways marked on the map 
 have now become 'green lanes'.The lane
 which runs through farmland south from
 Beverstone to Hookshouse is passable  
 in an ordinary car with extreme care  
 in dry weather.Other routes such as   
 Chavenage Lane which leaves the A.4135
 at grid.ref.867935 are now impassable 
 to ordinary cars.
