		<title>19NEW MILK BOTTLES</title>
		<content> On June 16th. 1985 new shaped milk    
 bottles were introduced in the Durham 
 area.They were to replace the old     
 style bottles which had been in use   
 since 1970.                           
 The new bottles were the idea of the  
 bottle manufacturers and they have    
 altered all their machinery to make   
 them.                                 
 The manufacturers claim tha they are  
 cheaper to make,are lighter and will  
 last longer.                          
 The new bottles are shorter and wider 
 than the old ones and are supposed to 
 be easier to handle.                  
 Apart from the bottle manufacturers   
 the makers of milk crates are also    
 very busy.They have to make and supply
 new crates into which the new bottles 
 will fit.                             
                                       
                                       </content>
