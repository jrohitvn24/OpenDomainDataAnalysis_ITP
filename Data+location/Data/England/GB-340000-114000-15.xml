		<title>15CARNIVAL AND PANCAKE RACES.</title>
		<content> Every  September at South Petherton   
 recreation ground we have a fair it   
 lasts until the carnival night. The   
 rides that we get are, the Bumper     
 cars,and the Waltsers, Swinging       
 Chairs, Cyclones, Roundabouts and the 
 Noah's Ark. On the last night of the  
 fair we have a Carnival. There are    
 floats and people dress up. Floats are
 just lorrys that go round the streets 
 and people dress up and ride on them. 
 They also decorate the lorries. We    
 have a Carnival Queen and there is one
 Princess and one attendant. There are 
 girls who march with batons called    
 Majorettes. There's also a band. Every
 Shrove Tuesday there are pancake races
 in St.James' Street South Petherton   
 There are different ages for each     
 race. After, there is a Shriving      
 service at the Parish church where    
 they give out prizes.                 </content>
