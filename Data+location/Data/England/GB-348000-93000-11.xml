		<content> The Brown family lived in the Manor   
 for 200 years. The last of the Brown  
 family to live there were two brothers
 who always argued so finally they     
 split the whole estate between them.  
 As a child Mr. William Crutchley found
 a silver spoon, probably thrown by the
 Brown brothers, when a yew arch was   
 cut. The next owner was a 'gin maker' 
 he installed acetylene gas lighting in
 1900, also he built Brown's Farm now  
 home of Mr. William Crutchley. The    
 Crutchley family, the present owners, 
 came to the Manor in 1938 and         
 installed electricity. The estate     
 contains 1960 acres; 100 acres is     
 woodland mainly deciduous. At one time
 there were 14 farms now managed by    
 one. At one time water was a problem  
 for farms until pumps were installed. 
 These are some of the types of farming
 dairy,arable,sheep &amp; beef cattle.     </content>
