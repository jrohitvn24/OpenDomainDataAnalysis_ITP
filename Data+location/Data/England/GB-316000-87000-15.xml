		<title>15MAYDAY IN BRANSCOMBE.</title>
		<content> Mayday is on the first day of May.The 
 school children usually do some       
 Maypole dancing and country dancing.  
 Usually the oldest girl and the oldest
 boy are Mayday queen and king.Before  
 the celebrations start the king and   
 queen have a tour of Branscombe in a  
 vintage car.The king and queen are    
 crowned by a Branscombe personality,  
 sometimes someone to do with the      
 school.The school children have a     
 procession down the lane to the       
 village hall,the older ones carrying  
 decorated hoops.They then bow to the  
 King and Queen and take their seats.  
 Then the dancing begins around the    
 maypole each child holding a ribbon.  
 If the weather permits it is held out 
 of doors,otherwise it is held in the  
 hall. Cream teas follow.An evening    
 country dance finishes the day.
