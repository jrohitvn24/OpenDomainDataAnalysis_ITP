		<title>06GREAT NORTH ROAD STEVENAGE</title>
		<content> The{Great North Road,}which played a  
 dominant role in shaping the          
 history of Stevenage, has now been    
 almost obliterated. Small stretches   
 may be seen beside the Leisure Centre 
 and  Six Hills Way.By 1800 about 20   
 coaches passed every day some of these
 were mail coaches and they were       
 targets for robbers. On March Ist     
 1810,mail bags containing letters     
 intended for Hatfield,Welwyn,Stevenage
 and other towns along the Great North 
 Road were stolen.A new mail sorting   
 office has just been built alongside  
 the old road and close to the new     
 railway station .  As soon as the     
 railway came Stevenage coaching days  
 were over.In 1868 the Stevenage       
 Biggleswade Turnpike Trust was ended  
 and the parts ot the road in          
 Hertfordshire were taken over by the  
 Hitchin District Highways Board.      </content>
