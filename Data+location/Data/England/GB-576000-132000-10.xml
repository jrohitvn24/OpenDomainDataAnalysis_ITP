		<title>10BENENDEN WEALD, CHANGES.</title>
		<content> We took the opportunity to re-survey  
 the grid sqare that was studied as    
 part of the Countrysides Commission's 
 changing countryside survey in 1968,  
 Square 578133. We read a great deal   
 about the dramatic changes which are  
 taking place but we found very little.
 The built up area was exactly the same
 as in 1968 as was the balance between 
 grassland and arable land. No fences  
 or hedges had been completely removed.
 At a few points, field boundaries     
 appeared to have changed but it is    
 often very difficult to distinguish   
 between a fence, a low, and a tall    
 hedge and a low one that needs        
 cutting. These minor changes can      
 easily be explained by the different  
 opinions of the observers! This is    
 perhaps a reflection of the unchanging
 face of the area.
