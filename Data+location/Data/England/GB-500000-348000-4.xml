		<title>04R.A.F. COLLEGE CRANWELL</title>
		<content> The main function of Cranwell College 
 is to train future officers for the   
 Royal Air Force. The planes which are 
 used for training young pilots are Jet
 Provosts.                             
 Cranwell camp has lots of clubs, these
 include tennis, golf and squash. There
 are many other facilities for officers
 stationed at Cranwell. There are three
 officers messes, which are called York
 house, Trenchard hall and College     
 hall. R.A.F. Cranwell is like a town, 
 because we have our own medical and   
 dental centres. There are two main    
 residential areas, one is the Airmen's
 Married Quarters, which is near the   
 school,the other is the Officers'     
 Married Quarters. There is one Primary
 School, which also serves local       
 villages, and a Nursery School for    
 younger children. The camp has its own
 banks, shops and a post office.       </content>
