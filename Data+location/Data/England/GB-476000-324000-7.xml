		<title>07Farming in the Scalford Area</title>
		<content> The farms in our area are mostly a    
 mixture of arable and livestock. All  
 of the farms have some livestock,     
 mostly dairy cattle.On some farms the 
 only crop grown is grass for making   
 hay and silage.Crops grown on other   
 farms include wheat, barley, potatoes 
 and oil seed rape.                    
    The Spring and Summer months are   
 spent tending and harvesting the crops
 , sorting them and sending them off to
 be processed into food. Crops for     
 feeding the cattle are kept on the    
 farm ready for use in the Winter. In  
 the Autumn, after clearing and        
 ploughing the land the farmers plant  
 seeds for the early crops next year.  
   Apart from dairy cattle, other      
 animals kept include some sheep and a 
 few pigs.The farmers have to work hard
 to keep their animals fit.Many animals
 are taken to be sold at Melton market.</content>
