		<content>There are many farms on the map but    
some are not working farms.Most of the 
farms are quite small with small       
fields.There are not many crops but    
grass is grown for hay and silage.     
Cattle and sheep graze in the fields.  
  Peakstones Farm is a dairy farm with 
100 cows and breeds shire horses.      
 Cote Farm is part of a very large     
farm, Wooton Farm Ltd. owned by        
Bamfords of JCB,(much outside the      
block).The farm is 2000 acres          
altogether but only 10 people work     
there.There were 1600 ewes and 2700    
lambs,100 cows with calves,beef cattle 
and some bulls. Mrs Bamford has a cow  
for her own milk.Rabbits are a nuisance
 and there are a lot of pheasants.     
 The large fields of Cote Farm are     
 surrounded by miles of grey metal     
 fencing. There are no hedgerows but   
 there are copses for wildlife.        </content>
