		<title>11THE PARISH CHURCH</title>
		<content>{                                      
   A church stood on this site in      
 Mediaeval times. It stood in the south
 -east corner of the present           
 churchyard.This was demolished in 1850
 and the present church constructed in 
 1851 by Lord Halifax,the major        
 landowner in the area.Two stone heads 
 were recovered from the original      
 church and these were built, along    
 with the Halifax coat of arms, into   
 the church wall. A major earth        
 movement in the early 1960's caused   
 the graveyard to sink four            
 feet,demolished the belfry and caused 
 extensive damage inside the           
 church.Cracks can still be seen       
 crossing the floor of the church.Parts
 that fell from the church can be seen 
 in the churchyard at the rear of the  
 church.
