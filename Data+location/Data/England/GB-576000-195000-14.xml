		<title>14A DAY IN MY LIFE</title>
		<content>  I woke up and went downstairs into   
 the lounge, sat down and watched      
 Breakfast Television.  Then my dad had
 to go to work at Hall Ropner.  I said 
 goodbye and he went to catch his      
 train, my mum came in, then I asked   
 for my breakfast. I had Frosties and  
 then watched more television. After, I
 went and got washed and dressed. I put
 on a blue and white blouse and a blue 
 and white skirt. Then I went to school
 in a black Ambassador car and crossed 
 the road.  Then we went in and had the
 register and went into assembly. Then 
 we did maths, and soon it was lunch-  
 time. I had a packed lunch. We then   
 went swimming until home time. When I 
 got home I went down riding, came home
 again, had my tea, got undressed      
 and went to bed.
