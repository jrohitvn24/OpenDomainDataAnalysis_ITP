		<title>07THE SWING BRIDGE,NEWCASTLE</title>
		<content>   The {Swing Bridge}was designed and  
 built by{Lord Armstrong}in 1876 at the
 cost of Â£240000.It stands on the site 
 of Newcastle's first Roman bridge.    
 Weighing more than 1200 tons, it was  
 designed to swing open to allow ships 
 to pass through on their way to and   
 from the {coal staithes}at Dunston.   
 Today the staithes are closed and very
 little coal passes down the river.    
   The team of men who once worked on  
 the bridge has been reduced from 19   
 to 6. The{hydraulic gear}is still in  
 full working order and is regularly   
 serviced. The paintwork is white so   
 that the sunlight is reflected and the
 bridge does not expand. Mr.Pringle    
 showed us around and told us that when
 he retires next year, he hopes that he
 is given a penny for every rivet in   
 the bridge.
