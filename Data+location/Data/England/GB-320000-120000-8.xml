 mountain of apples from all over the  
 surrounding area brought by           
 wheelbarrow;in plastic bags in farm   
 trailers and of course in large       
 lorries.                              
 There are also smaller areas of fruit 
 production more concerned with soft   
 fruit such as goosesberries,          
 raspberries and strawberries, with a  
 "pick your own" style of marketing.   
 Some of the individual farms are quite
 large(75 hectares and over) though    
 they are by no means as large as the  
 arable farms of East Anglia for       
 example,with their 300 hectares+.In   
 the 2 kilometre squares around Dipford
  all the land is owned by seven       
 farms..viz.Dipford Farm,Higher Dipford
 Farm,Middle Sweethay,Lower Sweethay   
 Canonsgrove Farm,Wrexon Farm and      
 Fullards Farm.                        </content>
