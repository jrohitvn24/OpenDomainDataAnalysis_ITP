		<title>14WIRRAL WAY. NESTON</title>
		<content>                                       
 The Wirral Way is a pleasant tree     
 lined pathway stretching from West    
 Kirby to Hooton.It is twelve miles    
 long and consists of a horse track and
 footpath with lovely views over the   
 Dee Estuary to North Wales.It used to 
 be a single track railway for steam   
 trains.Most of the people we          
 interviewed use the Wirral Way and    
 most use it on foot rather than on    
 horseback.The majority of people use  
 it less than once a week.Both locals  
 and visitors use the Wirral Way for   
 exercise and also exercising their    
 dogs, although some locals use it     
 mainly as a short cut.Dog owners say  
 it is handy because their dogs are    
 able to roam free from the danger of  
 traffic.The Wirral Way can be used for
 nature walks especially by local      
 school children.                      </content>
