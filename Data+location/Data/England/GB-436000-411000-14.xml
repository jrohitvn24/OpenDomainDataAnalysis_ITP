		<title>14Royston Church Painting</title>
		<content> A 19th C. painting of Royston Parish  
 Church was auctioned at Christies as  
 part of a collection of important     
 English pictures.The painting remains 
 a mystery.  Neither Christies or the  
 local clergy know who painted it or   
 when.  Rev.John Hudson described the  
 painting as an "exciting find"        
 particularly during the 750th         
 anniversary of the parish.The painting
 measures 22"by 30". It shows the front
 view of the church and the graveyard  
 and has two children feeding geese in 
 the foreground. A local historian has 
 dated the painting at about 1820 to   
 1840. Fortunately the painting did    
 not leave the area.It was bought at   
 Christies by a local lady as a        
 surprise birthday gift for her        
 husband.It was valued between Â£3-4,000
 and the lady said she was very happy  
 with the auction price of just Â£3500. </content>
