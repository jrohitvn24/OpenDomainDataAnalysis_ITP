		<content>      Whitehanger is on a hill at      
 Marley Lane. It is called a Hanger    
 because it is at the top of a hill. It
 was built in 1907-1908 by Sir Aaron   
 Moore and became a nursing home       
 in 1940. It has 80 old people and     
 around 60 staff. They have enlarged it
 to have more old people. The nursing  
 home has 53 acres of garden . It is a 
 very big nursing home.                
      Valewood House, another nursing  
 home in the area, consists of 17 staff
 for 23 old people. It has been a home 
 since 1982. Among other activities the
 old folk go on picnics, dancing,      
 knitting, sewing, art and flower      
 arranging. Most of the people in the  
 home come from this area, although    
 some come from London.
