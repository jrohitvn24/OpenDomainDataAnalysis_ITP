		<title>12A SURVEY OF LOCAL HOUSES</title>
		<content>     We did a survey of the houses of  
 the children in the junior classes.   
 We wanted to find out what they were  
 built of, what the roof was made      
 of, and how old they were. 35 replies 
 were received.                        
     Many of the replies said that     
 their houses were built of more than  
 one material, but we were still       
 surprised that only 42% were made of  
 brick. A third contained stone, and   
 a third are made at least partly of   
 cob. 15% were made of concrete blocks 
 and 6% of wood.                       
     We found that 45% of the houses   
 were roofed with slate, 42% with      
 tiles, and only 13% thatched. We      
 thought more of the cob houses would  
 have had thatched roofs.              
     We found 26% had been built since 
 1970, 24% built before 1750, and the  
 rest evenly spread between.           </content>
