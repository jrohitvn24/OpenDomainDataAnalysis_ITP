		<content>  Most people seem to think there ought
 to be more sports facilities.Also     
 people think there ought to be more   
 opportunities for small rural         
 industries.                           
  Half of the village think the        
 reservoir should be abandoned and the 
 other half think it should be built.  
 Quite a few people think there should 
 be more development of cheaper        
 housing. Hardly any people think there
 should be many more houses and a few  
 people think there should be more good
 quality houses not cheap houses. It is
 proposed that the{Bull's Head}pub soon
 going to close and in it's place a    
 housing estate is going to be         
 built. A lot of people are very sorry 
 to lose one of the pubs in spite of   
 the fact they want some cheaper       
 houses.                               
                                       </content>
