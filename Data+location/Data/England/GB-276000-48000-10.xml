		<content> The P.T.A and the school have a good  
 working relationship. They raise money
 through _ out the year for addional   
 items the school requires. They raise 
 this through organising various       
 activities  such as a Summer Fayre at 
 which all children participate.Each   
 term the children do a different      
 project. The last one being           
 Electricity.  Parents were invited to 
 school one evening and the children   
 showed everyone all the experiments   
 they had learnt.   Once a year there  
 are Parent-Teacher consultations.  In 
 the Spring Term parents have a social 
 evening.  Sports day is held at the   
 end of the Summer Term.  There is also
 an assembly at which the leavers      
 perform a play to which parents are   
 invited.  A pantomine is held in the  
 Christmas Term.  The old age          
 pensioners and playgroup are invited. </content>
