		<content> Mum gets me up at 8 o'clock,opening   
 the curtains to let the morning       
 sunshine in.I slowly put my school    
 clothes on and go downstairs. Mum has 
 the T.V. on and Ann Diamond is giving 
 the time..8.15.Mum comes in with a    
 tray of cornflakes and coffee, and my 
 brother Gavin appears to eat his.After
 finishing, I go to the bathroom to get
 washed and do my teeth,spray perfume  
 on my neck and then do my hair.Time is
 8.35 and Gavin is almost ready for    
 school.I leave, Gavin a few paces in  
 front of me.It's warming up outside,  
 and my friends are waving to me.We    
 get into school, and it's a page of   
 'averages' to do for maths.I can't    
 wait to get outside into the sun.After
 playtime,we do Domesday               
 work.Lunchtime, and I walk home for a 
 salad.The afternoon is easy and       
 slow.My Science is done and it's time </content>
