		<title>05CHANGES IN CHAPEL-E-L-FRITH</title>
		<content> The main change has been an increase  
 in house-building but a decrease in   
 amenities. New houses have been built 
 at each end of the town catering for  
 young couples &amp; families. 60% are     
 private &amp; 40% council-owned.Materials 
 used are natural stone &amp; brick.       
 The population has increased to 7750. 
 Young couples have become residents,  
 many being commuters.Several factories
 have closed but Ferodo Ltd.the main   
 employer is now engaging more workers.
 There are good prospects for new      
 industrial estates as Chapel is       
 designated a rural development area.  
 Three all-age schools have become     
 infant,junior &amp; comprehensive repect- 
 ively;junior &amp; senior being completely
 new buildings.There are various play- 
 groups,one using an unused terrapin   
 building at the junior school.(From an
 interview with a local councillor).   </content>
