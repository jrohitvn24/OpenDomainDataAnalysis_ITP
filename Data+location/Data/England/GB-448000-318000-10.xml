		<title>10Shepshed's Local Language</title>
		<content>    Before the age of modern transport 
{Shepshed}was quite an insular village 
 with a good deal of intermarriage.    
 This meant that a{local language      
 developed of which several phrases    
 have continued to survive.            
   Men greeting other men of whom they 
 have only a casual acquaintance use   
 the term{"hey up surrey".             
   Around the village are a number of  
 footpaths between houses. These are   
 known as{"jitties" or"snickets".}While
 anyone walking on the pavement would  
 be walking on the{ "pad" or "coursey".
   A child who was cheeky would be     
{"chelpin"}and might be admonished     
 with{"less of your chelp".            
 A sign of bad weather to come would be
 announced by the comment{"it looks    
{black over Bill's mother's".
