		<title>12Fire Service, Haltwhistle</title>
		<content>   Haltwhistle has its own fire station
 with one fire engine.  It is manned   
 entirely by part time firemen who are 
 paid a yearly retainer and for each   
 call out.  On Tuesdays a fire practice
 is held beside the big tower in the   
 station yard. Children love to watch. 
   The part time firemen all work near 
 the fire station and carry their own  
 personal alarms.  When the alarm goes 
 off they can be seen running, driving,
 or cycling at top speed to the station
 their tools left lying on the ground. 
 Chimney fires and hay barn fires are  
 the most common reasons for being     
 called out.  In outlying districts the
 lack of a mains water supply often    
 makes their job very difficult.       
   Every year the firemen hold a dance 
 to raise funds for the station.       
 Last November they  supervised a town 
 bonfire and fireworks display.        </content>
