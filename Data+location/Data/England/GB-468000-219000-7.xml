They are always super events.          
   This year, the fete raised          
approximately five hundred pounds for  
the church.                            
   It was very hot on the day,and I    
don't think that the people were       
feeling very energetic as they just    
walked around not doing much. The      
ice-creams did well though!            
   Stalls included White               
Elephant,Books, Cakes (Home Produce),  
Lucky Dip, Nearly New Jumble and       
Tombola.                               
   Of course there was Golf , Bowling, 
Ice-creams and Refreshments.           
    It is a really great time out.     
   There is a pond in the back garden  
of the Manor, which is shady , and you 
could walk around it.
