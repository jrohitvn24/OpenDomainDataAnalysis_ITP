		<content>    The main industry in our survey    
 area was{water sports}eg.sailing and  
 small boat building.                  
   {House building}is another prominant
 industry as Hythe is a growing        
 residential area.                     
    A{marina village}is under          
 consruction on the waterside.It has   
 hydraulic locks through which boats   
 enter and leave.                      
    There are already  boats inside the
 locked areas although it will be      
 many years before the marina is       
 finished .An old metal anchor outside 
 the Marina Information Centre was     
 found during dredging operations.     
    The adjoining village of Hythe has 
 a good shopping centre which would    
 cater for all the needs of a growing  
 community. Hythe is commercially well 
 equipped to cope with a growing       
 population.                           </content>
