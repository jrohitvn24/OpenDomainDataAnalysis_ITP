		<title>19STREAM STUDY, SOMERFORD AREA</title>
		<content>   The stream,which is known as the    
 willows because of the trees around   
 it,runs into the River Avon.We studied
 this for two hours in one week and we 
 found out a lot about this brook.We   
 found this information out in July.   
 Most of the ditches in Great Somerford
 run into this stream.There are lots of
 minnows and insects living in this    
 stream.We saw caddisfly larvae,beetles
 leeches,shrimps,dragonflies and mayfly
 nymphs.There are quite a lot of common
 birds around the willows.We saw a     
 family of blue tits and a family of   
 chaffinches and a family of great     
 tits.The surroundings at the willows  
 are perfect for birds to nest in and  
 some are well camouflaged. A funnel   
 fixed to a big jam jar makes a useful 
 minnow trap. There are lots of wild   
 plants round the stream, such as      
 forget-me-nots and red campion.       </content>
