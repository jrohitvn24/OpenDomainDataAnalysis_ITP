		<content> Locally or homegrown produce and eggs 
 enable people to batch-bake and       
 prepare food and vegetables for quick 
 and wholesome meals using freezing and
 other methods of preserving. Wine and 
 beer are made using hedgerow fruits or
 kits. As a result of foreign travel   
 dishes fron other countries are cooked
 or brought home ready prepared. The   
 main meal is usually in the evening.  
 Barbecues are popular. Microwave ovens
 are time saving.Telephones,central    
 heating and double glazing are common 
 as are washing machines. Many homes   
 have television, videos and music     
 centres for leisure interest and      
 instruction. Some homes have burglar  
 alarms and "Neighbourhood Watch"      
 schemes help keep homes secure. Some  
 horses and ponies are owned but dogs, 
 cats and fish in ponds are more usual 
 pets. Ponds attract frogs and insects.</content>
