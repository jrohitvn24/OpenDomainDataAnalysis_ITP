		<title>04The affects of the river</title>
		<content> The River Thames is the northern      
border of the area.Its flood plain has 
produced very fertile soil which is    
efficiently farmed.The main villages   
lie on the high ground to the south.   
 The river is used by anglers and      
holiday makers on boats.Pike,perch,chub
barble and bream are found here.       
 Newbridge is one of the oldest bridges
over the Thames.It was rebuilt in 1462 
from Cotswold Stone.The middle stone   
locks the arch together.There is an inn
on each side of the bridge which also  
was the site of a battle in the Civil  
War.                                   
 Appleton Bridge is a footbridge       
further downstream.It is made from wood
on cement piers.It is very steep and   
moves up and down if you jump on it.Its
purpose was to join the lock-keeper's  
house to the other bank.Only a few     
bricks remain of the house and lock.   </content>
