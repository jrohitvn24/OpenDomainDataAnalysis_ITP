		<title>11INDUSTRY - FARMING</title>
		<content> In this area of 12 square kilometres, 
 there are no fewer than 10 active and 
 separate farming units.  Some are     
 devoted to exclusive production of    
 milk and dairy products, some         
 exclusively to the production of grain
 and cereal crops.  No farms in the    
 area are exclusively given to sheep   
 rearing, but many run sizeable flocks.
 There is some beef cattle production, 
 and some farms have the usual         
 assortment of pigs, hens, ducks, etc. 
                                       
 All farms are highly mechanised. One  
 of our team wrote "Most tractors have 
 got pick-up hitches, and three point  
 pick-up linkage. My dad's tractor is a
 Ford TW25 164HP, and is 4Wheel Drive. 
 4WD is very useful in slick           
 conditions, and for silageing it stops
 you from running away with full       
 loads."                               </content>
