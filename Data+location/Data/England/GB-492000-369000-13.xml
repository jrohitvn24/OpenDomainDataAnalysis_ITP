		<content> In sqs.9471,9571,9470 and 9570        
 the land is agricultural and the only 
 houses we found were{farm houses}which
 were detached and surrounded by barns.
 In sq. 9469 there is a mixture of     
{council and private houses}which are  
 all built of brick and are separated  
 by Hartsholme Park. The{private houses
 are still being built and cost        
 between Â£45000 and Â£70000. They are   
 all detached, have double garages and 
 some of them back onto the lake.      
 The council houses are{semi-detached, 
{terraced or flats.}They are about 30  
 years old and all have gardens but not
 many had a garage because cars were   
 not so popular when they were built.  
 The{flats}were built of brick, 4      
 stories high and had grassed areas    
 around them. The other block of flats 
 had 16 floors, were made of concrete  
 and brick and are about 15 years old. </content>
