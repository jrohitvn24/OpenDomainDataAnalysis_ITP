		<title>12Didbrook Parish Church</title>
		<content>{Didbrook}belonged for many years to   
{Hailes Abbey}near by. The dedication  
 of church and parish to St.George may 
 date from about 1347 when Edward III  
 founded the Order of the Garter, about
 which time St.George seems to have    
 replaced Edward the Confessor as      
 Patron Saint of England. In 1451      
{William Whitchurch,}monk of Hailes,   
 became Vicar of Didbrook. He rebuilt  
 the parish church, in the 15th.       
 century Cotswold style. The tower     
 contains five bells. The tower is     
 "engaged" ie. built inside the west   
 end of the nave, and not, as with most
 western towers, projecting out from   
 the nave. As Didbrook church has no   
 side aisles its north and south walls 
 are supported on arches. Its other    
 features are the open trussed rafter  
 and queen-post roof of the nave.
