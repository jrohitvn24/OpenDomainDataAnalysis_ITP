		<title>02A day in the life of Claire</title>
		<content>  I wake up, have a look outside to see
 what it is like. I choose my clothes, 
 according to the weather.When my mum  
 shouts me, I go downstairs to the     
 bathroom, have a wash and clean my    
 teeth. Then I have some toast and     
 coffee. I get dressed, get my bag, say
 goodbye to my mum and brother, then I 
 go to call for Tammy Clark. We start  
 to hurry to school because it is      
 getting late. The whistle goes then we
 have assembly.After assembly we go in 
 to our classroom, have registration,  
 we have English,followed by           
 playtime,then Maths and television.   
 After dinner we have topic and P.E. We
 go home and I play with my friends. My
 mum calls me in for tea.When I finish 
 my tea I go back out and play with my 
 friends.At 9.00p.m. I go in, have a   
 wash,clean my teeth,and brush my hair.
 I go to bed and read.                 </content>
