 what we liked and disliked about      
 living in a village.We all wrote      
 things on  pieces of paper.Then we    
 talked about them.We chose the best   
 ones and voted for them like this.

 animals to look at.The quietness      
 of the countryside .

 are small and you know everybody!     
{15% It is quiet and peaceful,}You
