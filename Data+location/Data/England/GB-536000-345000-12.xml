		<title>12BUTTERWICK FISH SHOP</title>
		<content>{Mr.and Mrs.Horton}got the idea of     
 starting  a fish and chip shop when   
 Harold,the owner,was made             
 redundant.They had had one before and 
 they couldn't do anything else because
 Harold was over fifty years of age and
 he couldn't get a job anywhere else.  
 But as soon as this came on the       
 market they bought it and started     
 their business.They have deliveries of
 fish from{Grimsby}from a man called   
{Peter Cadies}twice a week. They use up
 to thirty bags of potatoes a week.They
 have been in this business for two    
 and a half years and they like the    
 job. They use locally grown potatoes.
