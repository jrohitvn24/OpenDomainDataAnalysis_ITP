		<content>    This four acre holding is geared to
 producing vegetables and fruit and    
 salad crops including{raspberries,    
{blackcurrants and gooseberries,}for   
{local trade}calling at the door.      
    Plants and shrubs are also grown.  
 There are three greenhouses and the   
 gardens are well set out and beginning
 to mature. The business has been      
 going for 2\ years.                   
    Because it is not in a very        
 prominent position, but set on a quiet
 country lane,{advertising}should be a 
 prime consideration, but the owners,  
 at present, seem reluctant to take    
 advantage of modern advertising and   
 rely on local{'Word of Mouth'}custom.
