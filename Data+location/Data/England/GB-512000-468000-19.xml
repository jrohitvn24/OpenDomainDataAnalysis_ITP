		<title>19Children's Pets.</title>
		<content> In Boynton School ten children have   
 pet dogs, ten have cats, five have    
 budgerigars and two keep pigeons. One 
 father has racing pigeons as a hobby. 
 Seven children have rabbits and two   
 have pet mice. Seven families keep    
 hens and geese. Three children have   
 ducks. One child has a pet ferret and 
 five children have goldfish. Most     
 people have quite a large garden so   
 that they can keep poultry.
