		<title>12BEVERTON FARM</title>
		<content> When he used to farm he would get up  
 early but now he will stay in bed     
 until about 7.30am because as he said 
 he had not much to do.                
 He has no animals left now except a   
 few bantams which he keeps for the    
 eggs. He used to keep cattle but these
 all went when he sold most of the     
 land.                                 
 He has no fresh milk but buys dried,  
 skimmed milk in the shops in          
 Wiveliscombe.                         
                                       
 He talked of the change in schooling, 
 he used to walk to Clatworthy school  
 which was about three miles away when 
 he was a boy walking through long     
 muddy lanes. Now children are taken   
 out by car or school bus to           
 Wiveliscombe or Minehead.
