 made of stone,there are not very many 
 red brick houses.There are quite alot 
 of miners cottages especially in      
 Radstock,and many of them,people are  
 still living in,from the mines which  
 are'nt used now.Most of the houses in 
 our D.Block are in estates and have   
 tile roofs.                           
   In our D.Block we have a market     
 which opens every Friday and Saturday.
 The market is where people come to    
 sell clothes,furniture,jewellery and

   There are many shops covering our   
 D.Block,but there is only one main    
 shopping centre which is being        
 remodernised.
