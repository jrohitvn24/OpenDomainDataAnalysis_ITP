		<title>06POST OFFICE HATHERDEN.</title>
		<content> Mrs Ingold, the owner of the post     
 office, has lived in Hatherden for 13 
 years.She has owned the post office 9 
 years.She opens at 9 and closes at    
 5:30 with an hour off for lunch. She  
 is open every day of the week except  
 Tuesday.The unusual thing about this  
 post office is that it is in the      
 entrance hall of her semi_detached    
 house.The counter is across her       
 entrance hall and you just walk in    
 through her front door.Mrs Ingold's   
 daughter Nicola, who is 17,sometimes  
 works in the post office to give her  
 mother a break. They have to be very  
 careful over security and have a      
 burglar alarm,locks on all windows,a  
 Belgian shepherd guard dog and an     
 emergency telephone number.What       
 brought her to work in the post office
 was that she could work at home while 
 her children were at school.          </content>
