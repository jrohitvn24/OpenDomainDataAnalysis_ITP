		<title>11A CHILD'S DAY, CALDER VALE 1</title>
		<content>    I wake up in the morning. It is a  
 school day. My mum is going to work so
 she is up too. After breakfast my mum 
 makes my packed lunch which usually   
 consists of four sandwiches, a packet 
 of crisps, a piece of cake or a       
 chocolate biscuit.                    
 My mum works at the Village Store.It  
 is her busiest day today as it is     
 Friday and today they have cream      
 cakes.                                
 To get to school I have to walk       
 through the woods. It is quite a steep
 path. In the spring it is full of blue
 bells but it is still just as hard to 
 walk up.                              
 At home time I go into the shop to get
 the key off my mum. I usually get to  
 the shop at half past three. On a     
 Friday the mill finishes at 3.30 and  
 there is a queue in the shop so I have
 to wait quite a long time.            </content>
