		<content> All-Saints Church, Highertown was     
 recently upgraded into a fully-fledged
 Parish Church, because of the growth  
 of new estates in the area, mainly at 
 Newbridge and Nansavallon. It has been
 refurbished, and takes part in many   
 local activities; a Church Fete raised

 Church is represented in the area by  
 Our Lady of the Portal with St Piran, 
 where there are connections with the  
 Carmelite Order, and the Knights of St
 Columba; the parish covers our entire 
 block. The Non-conformist Methodist   
 tradition in Cornwall is represented  
 by St Mary Clement, Union Place,centre
 of a thriving community. The Society  
 of Friends,the Quakers, have a meeting
 place in Pauls Terrace. The Salvation 
 Army has a base in Kenwyn Street. The
