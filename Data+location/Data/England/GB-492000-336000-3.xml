		<title>03GRANTHAM'S TWIN TOWN</title>
		<content>{In recent years in Britain it has     
{become popular for towns and cities to
{'Twin' with similar places abroad,    
{especially in Europe. Grantham is     
{twinned with the German town of Sankt 
{Augustin near the West German capital 
{Bonn. Each year for the last 6 years  
{several exchanges between groups have 
{taken place. 1985 saw a group of 42   
{German scholars aged between 13 and 17
{from the Realshule Neiderpleis visit  
{Grantham. Whilst in the area they went
{to several places of interest         
{including St Wulframs church, the     
{leisure centre etc. During their stay 
{they joined forces with their hosts   
{from St Wulframs school in the centre 
{of the survey area on a walking rally 
{which took them around and about the  
{town. The German teachers suggested a 
{return visit by Grantham children.
