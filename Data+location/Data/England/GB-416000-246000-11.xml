		<title>11LEISURE :           QUINTON</title>
		<content>  {Amenities and facilities}for the    
 villagers of Quinton are a continuing 
{subject for debate.                   
   For the very{young children}in army 
 quarters, or on the council estates,  
 there is some open{space,}with        
 slides, swings etc. There is the      
{village green in Upper Quinton.       
   For adults, there are{two}pubs. Many
 people{walk}locally, especially up    
 Meon Hill.The{village hall}has some   
 programme of events, but this does not
 seem to cater for everybody.          
   For the{youth,}the old village      
 school is used as a{club.}However, for
 most amenities,locals have to travel  
 to{Stratford.                         
  {Facilities on the army base}can be  
 used by service families, but         
 civilians have very limited access.   
   The village shops provide good,basic
 requirements.  A library van calls.   </content>
