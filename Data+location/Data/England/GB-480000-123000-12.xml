		<content>    During our surveys we have found   
 the following samples of flora and    
 fauna.                                
      Red Campion, Buttercup, Wild     
 Poppy, Cowparsley, Dogroses, Germander
 Speedwell, Dandelion, Comfrey,        
 Knapweed, Rosebay Willowherb,         
 Charlock, and Grannie pop out of bed. 
    Frogs, slow worms, newts, an       
 asortment of moths and butterflies and
 several stag beetles, both male and   
 females.                              
   There was more evidence of          
 squirrels, Roe deer, mice and rats    
 both by the dung and the eating       
 habits.                               
    Red Mice have a white flash on     
 the chest they are one of the         
 rarity of the area but we did not see 
 any. However we estimated there were  
 at least 6 field mice to a 10 metre   
 square on one field test.             </content>
