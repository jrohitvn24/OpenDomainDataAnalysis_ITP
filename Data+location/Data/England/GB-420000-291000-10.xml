		<content>    With the increasing private        
 ownership of cars, the need for public
 transport declined to the extent where
 it has become almost non_existent.    
 There are buses night &amp; morning which 
 cater for some people working out of  
 the area &amp; students at Nuneaton       
 Colleges. Shoppers' buses also serve  
 the villages on certain days, but no  
 public transport as such is available.
    Very few families have no can at   
 all and 75% have two cars. The        
 majority of these are privately owned 
 although in some 2 car families one of
 the vehicles is a firm's car.One or   
 two families have caravanettes        
 &amp; horse_boxes to aid their leisure    
 pursuits.                             
    There is no passenger train service
 in the area.
