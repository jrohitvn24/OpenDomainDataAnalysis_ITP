		<title>01The Floral Town Of Nantwich.</title>
		<content>   Nantwich is a pleasant place to live
 with plenty of things to see and do.It
 is very pretty because of all the     
 flowers and the black and white       
 buildings.In Spring and Summer all the
 gardens,roads and buildings have      
 beautiful flowers decorating them     
 because Nantwich is one of Britain's  
{floral towns.                         
   The old{black and white}buildings   
 and the church in the square are now  
 surrounded by modern paved areas that 
 make the centre traffic-free.There is 
 a new indoor swimming pool and also an
 outdoor natural{brine bath,}possibly  
 the only one of its kind in the       
 country.The people of Nantwich are    
 very friendly,and those born in the   
 town are known as 'Dabbers'.All this  
 and the surrounding{landscape}make    
 it a delightful place to live or      
 visit.                                </content>
