		<title>03THE CHURCHES.</title>
		<content>  There is an Anglican church in each  
 of the three villages,{Figheldean,    
{Fittleton and Netheravon.}There are   
 also two chapels but the one in       
 Figheldean is redundant and used as a 
 meeting room,the other is a Roman     
 Catholic chapel.                      
  All the churches and the churchyards 
 are well looked after. Figheldean is  
 dedicated to{St: Michael and all      
{Angels}and the other two to{All       
{Saints.}                              
  Figheldean Church,built of flint and 
 rubble,dates from 1100. The most      
 unusual feature is the flight of      
 seven steps from the nave to the      
 chancel.                              
  There are three bells, two from 1851 
 and the third 1721.                   
  The kneelers were recently made by   
 parishioners and have designs of      
 British birds worked on them.         </content>
