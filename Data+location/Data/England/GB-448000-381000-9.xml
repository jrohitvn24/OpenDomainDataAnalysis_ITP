		<title>09THE CHESTERFIELD CANAL</title>
		<content>  THE CANAL IS ABOUT ONE KILOMETRE     
 SOUTH OF SOUTH ANSTON,IN  A           
 VALLEY BETWEEN THE VILLAGE AND THORPE 
 SALVIN. THE CANAL WAS OPENED IN 1777  
 AND WAS DESIGNED BY JAMES BRINDLEY. IT
 IS NOW DISUSED.                       
                                       
 IT IS POSSIBLE TO WALK IN QUIET       
 COUNTRYSIDE FROM KIVETON PARK TO      
 SHIREOAKS                             
                                       
 THE CANAL IS A PEACEFUL,QUIET SORT    
 OF PLACE,JUST ABOUT THE ONLY NOISE IS 
 THE BIRDS. SOME PEOPLE LIKE THE CANAL 
 AS IT IS,BUT OTHER PEOPLE WOULD LIKE  
 TO OPEN IT AGAIN,WITH CANAL BOATS.    
                                       
                                       
 I HAVE MIXED FEELINGS ABOUT THE CANAL,
 BUT MOSTLY I WANT IT TO STAY THE SAME.
