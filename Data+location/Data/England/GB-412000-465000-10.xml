		<title>10Gamekeeping at Wath</title>
		<content>  The gamekeeper at Wath covers an area
 of 1350 acres. He is responsible for  
 the game shooting on this land, which 
 is mainly moorland. Most of the       
 shooting is for grouse and for this he
 has built another two butts this year.
 These are square in shape, built of   
 stone and about four feet high. The   
 walls are then finished off by putting
 peat on the top edge of the stones.   
 When a group of people are out grouse 
 shooting, two men use a butt and from 
 these they shoot the grouse as they   
 rise from the ground.                 
  Last night local gamekeepers were out
 fox hunting. They went out with guns  
 and dogs for two and a half hours, but
 only one fox was caught. They hunt    
 these animals because they eat grouse,
 particularly the young.               
  This year, some grouse have been     
 found dead because of the cold spring.</content>
