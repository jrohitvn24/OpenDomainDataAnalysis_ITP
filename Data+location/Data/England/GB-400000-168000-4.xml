		<title>04The Cherhill Gang</title>
		<content>{ The Cherhill Gang}was a group of     
 footpads who held up travellers in the
 late{18th Century.}The Cherhill Gang  
 would rob on the{London}to{Bath}road  
 (now called the A4).                  
                                       
 One man who was a member of the       
 Cherhill Gang was said to have done   
 his robbing in the nude. He said he   
 did this to avoid recognition! Some of
 the gang were caught and tried at     
{Devizes.}They were hung there and     
 later were strung up on a gibbet on   
{Cherhill Hill}as a warning to anyone  
 who might be tempted to join them.    
                                       
 The headquarters of the gang was the  
{Black Horse Inn,}one of the four inns 
 in the village at the time. The Black 
 Horse is the only remaining inn and   
 pictures and details of the gang can  
 still be seen there today.            </content>
