		<title>05Farm Life in Smethcott</title>
		<content>  The farm houses are large and old but
 facilities compare favourably with    
 those in towns.Washing machines,      
 fridges,freezers,electric cookers and 
 televisions are commonplace.Mains gas 
 is not available and mains water is   
 only being connected this year.Until  
 now the water supply has been from    
 local wells.                          
  As there is no public transport,     
 farmers'wives drive to supermarkets   
 for most shopping.Bread making at home
 is no longer common,but women bake    
 regularly,make jam,bottle and freeze  
 home grown fruit and vegetables and   
 are responsible for gardening.        
  Craftwork such as knitting and       
 tapestry are popular pastimes.Outside 
 interests include Womens'Institute,   
 Young Farmers' Club,the Grassland     
 Society and the British Horse Driving 
 Society.                              </content>
