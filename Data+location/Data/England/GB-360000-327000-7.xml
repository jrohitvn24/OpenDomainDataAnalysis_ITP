		<title>07HODNET'S FIRE STATION</title>
		<content> Many years ago the fire station was in
 Hearne Lane and was horse drawn with a
 hand operated pump.  Hodnet has a fire
 station because the "Sentinal" steam  
 lorries used to set fire to the       
 thatched roofs of the black and white 
 buildings.  The present fire station  
 is at the end of Station Road         
 (06140283). Practice nights are on    
 Mondays. The fire engine is a Ford    
 made in 1977.  The firemen are part   
 time volunteers and are called to the 
 station by personal "bleepers"; up    
 until 1983 a siren at the station     
 called them out.                      
    In 1985, plans were made for a new 
 fire station and this is to be built  
 on the side of the old one.  Also     
 incorporated will be a tower to       
 practice rescues from buildings. Calls
 are made for fires,chimney fires,     
 animal rescues and road accidents.    </content>
