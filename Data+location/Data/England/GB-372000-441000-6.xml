		<title>06CLITHEROE'S PLANNING OFFICER</title>
		<content>    Mr. Nock the Planning Officer has  
 seen many changes in Clitheroe. In the
 last seven years the major changes    
 have been the building of Booth's     
 Supermarket and the development of the
 Salthill Industrial Estate.           
    Clitheroe requires some more       
 facilities for children e.g. Youth    
 Clubs or B.M.X. tracks. Mr Nock thinks
 these are needed but are difficult to 
 open because people have to run them. 
 A sports area is being built by the   
 Council and the Round Table.          
    One of the main changes in the near
 future is the removal of the Auction  
 Mart to the Salthill Industrial       
 Estate.                               
    Mr. Nock has no typical day. He has
 to read letters and answer them. He   
 discusses things with other members of
 the Council. What he wants is to make 
 a better place to live and work.      </content>
