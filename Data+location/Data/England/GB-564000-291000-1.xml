		<content>   The area covered by the survey lies 
 either side of the Feltwell - Southery
 Road and is locally known as Poppylot 
 Road.                                 
   The whole district has, in the last 
 fifteen to twenty years been purchased
 by institutions (Insurance and pension
 funds) and farmed by farmers on a     
 rental or partnership basis. Both     
 farmers and labourers live in         
 surrounding villages                  
   The area lying between Poppylot Farm
 and Bourne Farm has been owned by     
 Norfolk County Council since l914/20, 
 and is farmed in units of about 100   
 acres by men who each have a bungalow 
 and a large barn plus smaller         
 buildings erected by themselves.      
 The whole area is peat over clay or   
 sand; the peat being about 4 feet deep
 to the north of the road and 6" to    
 1foot deep south of the road.         </content>
