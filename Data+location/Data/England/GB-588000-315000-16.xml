		<title>16  LANGUAGE OF LITCHAM</title>
		<content>  The Norfolk dialect is an            
interesting one with many unusual      
alternatives to the Queen's perfect    
English.Phrases and nouns   alike are  
changed.Although it's a wierd language 
most Norfolkers speak nomally  with    
just an accent.People who have lived   
in Norfolk for about ten years will    
speak a reasonable Norfolk.Here are a  
few unusual words with meanings:       
Jasper(wasp),Troshen(working),Grup     
(hole) and 'omen(lady).There are       
several ways of saying that you've been
told off or are going to be and that   
you,he or she is going to be angry.Here
are some:Mum shouted me-Mum shouted at 
me,I'll square you up,I got wrong,I'll 
rare up at you.Although words like oh  
arr and bootiful appear ficticious on  
T.V. they are actually used in the     
Norfolk language.
