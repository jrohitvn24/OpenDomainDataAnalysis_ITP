Our area is located in the north-east  
part of Staffordshire on the southern  
edge of the Peak District National Park
at approximately 300 m. height O.D.    
situated partly in an area of limestone
and mainly on gritstone moorlands.     
                                       
Heather, bilberry and crowberry grow on
the moorland. In the valleys a tree    
flora of oak, birch and mountain ash   
exist with bracken undergrowth.The     
limestone has a rich variety of        
shrubs, particularly hawthorn, grasses 
and flowering plants.                  
                                       
The landscape is attractive to tourists
exploring the valleys of the Rivers    
Hamps, Manifold and Dove. Many         
additional visitors pass through the   
area on their way to Alton Towers.
