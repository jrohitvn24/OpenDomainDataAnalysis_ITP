		<title>05THE MANOR NURSING HOME (2)</title>
		<content> The Nursing Home also has a private   
 surgery.When we walked into the       
 surgery it smelt as if it had just    
 been disinfected.The Surgeon,Mr Rogers
 told us that they had just finished   
 surgery.We were shown some instruments
 that were used at surgery.We were     
 shown an Operating Microscope.We      
 looked at the surgeon's hand through  
 it.There was also an Argon Lazer,bone 
 nibblers,bone cutters,artery forceps  
 and Telescope enlargers with which you
 you look into a tummy and it enlarges 
 it.We were then told to take our shoes
 off.Then we went into the main        
 Theatre. Here we were shown an        
 Antiseptic machine and a              
 Dithripulator which keeps you alive if
 you have a heart attack.
