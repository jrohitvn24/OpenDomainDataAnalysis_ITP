		<title>07THE RIVER AVON.</title>
		<content>{ The River Avon}flows through         
{Netheravon and Figheldean.}It is a    
 chalk stream and the Head Water Keeper
 is responsible for keeping it         
 stocked.The fishes' eggs are taken    
 from the river and hatched in an      
 incubator. After seventy days they    
 hatch and live on the yolk sac for    
 three weeks. At the end of three years
 when they are about eleven inches     
 long, they are returned to the river. 
  The main predators are the pike, the 
 kingfisher and the heron. Poachers can
 also be a problem.                    
  There are 90 members in the fishing  
 syndicate on this stretch of the Avon.
 The largest number of trout caught in 
 one season was 2100 in 1955. The      
 longest fish caught was a pike which  
 was 42 inches long and weighed 20lbs.
