		<content> as Chief Officer of the Norland when  
 she was requisitioned to carry the 2nd
 Battalion the Parachute Regiment to   
 the Falklands.I saw action there as   
 the Norland was used as an Assault    
 Ship during the initial landing phase.
 She was in fact the first ship to     
 enter San Carlos water during the     
 landing,suffering 4 days of heavy air 
 attacks before proceeding unescorted  
 to S.Georgia to meet the QE2 and bring
 units of the Guards and Gurkhas back  
 to the Falklands.After the Argentinian
 defeat,we made 2 runs with prisoners  
 of war; to Montevideo(Uruguay)and     
 Puerto Madryn(Argentina).I took over  
 as captain for 2 months while Norland 
 ferried troops between Ascension and  
 Pt.Stanley.In 1983 as Capt.of Norwave 
 we suffered a major fire and since as 
 Chief Officer Norland damaged her Port
 Stabiliser flooding the engine room.  </content>
