		<content> Mr Houghton's crops consist of:       
 a) Rhubarb - this is planted at any   
    time of the year, left 4/5 years   
    and then picked.  Replanting is not
    necessary for ten years.           
    Harvesting is done July to October.
 b) Apples - there is a small orchard. 
 c) Peas - these are grown for their   
    high protein content and are sold  
    to manufacturers who make different
    types of high protein food.        
                                       
  The l6 acres are sown in April and   
 harvested in October.                 
    These are sold in the farm shop and
 also on a pick your own basis.        
 There are 7l acres of land on Cold    
 Harbour Farm but the total of all four
 farms is 350 acres.  Mr Houghton has a
 farm secretary who comes once a month 
 but he manages the farm himself.  He  
 employs 4 workers.                    </content>
