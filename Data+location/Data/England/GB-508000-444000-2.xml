		<content> The village of Leven is low lying it  
 stands surrounded by fertile          
 agricultural land.The soils are       
 various,gravelly in the higher ground 
 &amp; a loamy,peaty mixture in the low.   
 This is called carrland.The subsoil is
 chiefly clay.The nature of the        
 soil compostion and the low lying land
 combined in the past to produce  a    
 waterlogged area,but from the middle  
 ages onwards drainage ditches &amp; dykes 
 have been constructed.The village has 
 a criss-crossing pattern of dykes &amp;   
 drains surrounding it, feeding into   
 major drainage works like the River   
 Hull &amp; the Beverley &amp;  Barmston       
 drain.This has made the land workable 
 and now it is intensively farmed, the 
 major crops being wheat,barley &amp; oil  
 seed rape with some root crops.Many of
 the older hedges have been removed to 
 make large fields.                    </content>
