		<title>01GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF AREA</title>
		<content>   Our twelve squares are mostly urban 
residential areas.There is a fair      
amount of wood and park lands spread   
mostly in the Highgate and Finsbury    
park areas.The houses are predominantly
Victorian although there is a small    
Georgian village and several council   
estates.We have no very large shopping 
precincts,only several assorted small  
shops.These are easily accessible via  
bus and train services. Also many roads
run through the shopping areas         
including the controversial A1(Archway 
Road.)                                 
   For the many people in this area the
facilities are fairly good,providing   
sports grounds,health services and     
other community requirements.However , 
some of the area is better off than the
rest,the further West you go the more  
affluent the society but the East has a
lower standard of living.              </content>
