		<title>01Southport, an introduction</title>
		<content>    Southport is a holiday resort on   
 the Lancashire coast. It has a        
 population of 90,000 and is situated  
 on a largely flat landscape containing
 many sandhills. It is a dormitory town
 for commuters to Liverpool and        
 Manchester. There is very little      
 industry apart from tourism.          
    The Southport theatre is a venue   
 for concerts and shows by             
 international stars. Other attractions
 of the town include a model village,  
 fairground, boating lake, zoo,        
 swimming pools, parks, shopping and of
 course the beach.                     
    Accommodation ranges from small    
 guest houses to large hotels and self 
 catering holiday flats.               
    Owing to the large proportion of   
 elderly people there are many         
 retirement homes.
