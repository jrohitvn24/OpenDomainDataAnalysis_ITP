		<content> At the side of Tockholes Rd. there is 
 a row of allotments where there are   
 many greenhouses. Allthe houses on the
 road are detached or semi-detached and
 all different because they have been  
 built by the owner or friend of the   
 owner. It is a viewpoint for the town 
 and when up here their are a lot of   
 rates to pay.The S.W corner of this   
 square is moor and woodland. Moving to
 the N.E corner is the main road and   
 just above is the place where all good
 shoppers come. It has many kinds      
 selling everything from toys to       
 antiques. It has several pubs,a branch
 of Do-It-All and a tyre centre. It    
 also has three Indian restaurants,    
 several take-aways and an ever growing
 branch of ICI. The river Darwen runs  
 down the back of the main road.
