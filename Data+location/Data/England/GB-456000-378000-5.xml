		<title>05THE RAILWAY STATION</title>
		<content> The passenger train service through   
 Worksop operates between Lincoln and  
 Sheffield. The booking office is open 
 at 7.15am. until 6.00pm. Passengers   
 pay on the train if they travel after 
 these times.                          
 A warning bell rings at the station   
 when a train is due. Two rings signal 
 a train from Retford and one          
 ring signals a train from Sheffield.  
 At the station there are three people 
 in the booking office, three porters, 
 two men to light the lamps and one man
 in the goods yard. Three men operate  
 the level crossing in eight hour      
 shifts. The crossing closes about 100 
 times a day, mostly for coal trains.  
 The signalman called this a           
 'merry-go-round'.
