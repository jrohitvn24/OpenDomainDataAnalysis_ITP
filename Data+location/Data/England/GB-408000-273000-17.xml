		<content> The majority of people in the area own
 their own homes which are mostly      
 detached and semi-detached homes or   
 bungalows.                            
   There are a few people who have     
 lived in the area for a long time but 
 the majority "come and go" due to     
 their employment.                     
   The main attraction for moving into 
 the area is the "rural aspect,"       
 without being to far removed from the 
 amenities of nearby towns and cities.
