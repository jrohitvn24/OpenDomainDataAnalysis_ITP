		<title>16Housing in Lyndhurst</title>
		<content> The main residential areas are by     
 roads south of Lyndhurst and Goose    
 Green.   Also the Clayhill, Meadow and
 Cedar Estates contain many detatched  
 houses.   Most of the houses in the   
 area are privately owned but there are
 a few council houses and tied         
 cottages.                             
 The age of the houses ranges from very
 new estates, such as the Meadow       
 Estate, to the tied cottages of the   
 forests which are around 400 years    
 old. The prices of houses in the town 
 range from the modern houses at about 
 Â£40 000 to larger houses with stables 
 for about Â£200 000.   The average     
 price for a house is Â£84 000.   There 
 are a few patches of derelict land    
 south of Lyndhurst which are going to 
 be built over with new houses in the  
 near future.                          
                                       </content>
