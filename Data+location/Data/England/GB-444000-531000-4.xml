		<content>{Dalton Piercy}is a small village,even 
 smaller than{Elwick,}about half a     
 mile from the{A19}road and one mile   
 south of{Elwick}.You can reach it by  
 an unclassified road,or a foot path   
 over the fields from{Elwick. Dalton}is
 a quiet village with the village hall 
 just behind the houses on the south   
 side of the green. The village has a  
 pond on the green with ducks on,but   
 vandals have been taking the ducks and
 their eggs away.                      
                                       
{     Dalton}doesn't have a shop,or a  
 public house,or a school or a church  
 or a regular bus service. The nearest 
 public house is half a mile away.     
 There is a public telephone box on the
 green, but the green has few trees on 
 it, which we think makes it less      
 attractive than{Elwick.
