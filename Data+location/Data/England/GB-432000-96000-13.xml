		<title>13CHILDHOOD IN BOLDRE</title>
		<content> Comments by Elanor,aged 10.           
 I like living in Boldre because of the
 lovely peaceful countryside and all   
 the baby animals in the Spring.There  
 are lots of lovely trees and places to
 play and to learn to ride horses. Some
 of the disadvantages are that none of 
 my friends live near me and school is 
 quite a long way away.There is not a  
 lot of public transport so I have to  
 ride my bike.I don't like riding in   
 the rain,but if it snows and school is
 closed "Good-O" Apart from going to   
 school I sing in the Church Chior &lt;but
 don't like going to practise>. I go to
 Brownies and enjoy it a lot. Near the 
 Hall there is a lovely Recreation     
 Ground for us to play in, it has      
 swings and a slide.
