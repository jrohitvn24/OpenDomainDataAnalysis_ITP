		<title>03THE LION FARM ESTATE OLDBURY</title>
		<content>  This council estate was built in the 
 1960's on land reclaimed from old mine
 workings. The estate is planned around
 a central crossroads, where most of   
 the amenities can be found. The       
 church, primary school, health centre,
 public library, public house and a    
 parade of shops are all situated      
 within this central area. In addition,
 there is an Old People's Home opposite
 the school.                           
  There are several tower blocks of    
 flats, but also many maisonettes and  
 'town houses'.                        
  As the estate is well defined by main
 boundary roads it forms quite a close 
 knit community. A Lion Farm Festival  
 has been held for the first time in   
 1985, involving sporting and cultural 
 activities. In the church hall various
 clubs and societies such as cub scouts
 meet.                                 </content>
