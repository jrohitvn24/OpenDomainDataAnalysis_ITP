		<content> The first man to find deposits of     
 china clay in Britain was William     
 Cookworthy, who discovered small      
 amounts near to St. Austell in 1748.  
 Many famous potters took leases on    
 pits to have ready access to supplies.
 By the 1870's there were about 120    
 separate pits. Following the mergers  
 of 1919, ECC was formed and in 1932 a 
 further merger produced the present   
 company: English Clays Lovering Pochin
 &amp; Co. Ltd. (known simply as ECLP). In 
 1956 the company was divided into its 
 present trading divisions: Quarries,  
 Clay, Transport &amp; Services, Building  
 and Leisure. In 1974 ECC entered the  
 oil industry through its interests in 
 International Drilling Fluids.        
 The China Clay industry is by far the 
 most dominating aspect of this area of
 Cornwall affecting local employment as
 well as the environment.  (Mike Yates)</content>
