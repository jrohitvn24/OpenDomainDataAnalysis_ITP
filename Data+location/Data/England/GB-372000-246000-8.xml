		<title>08THE VILLAGE HALL,CRADLEY.</title>
		<content> Cradley Village Hall was built in the 
 14th century.The hall was a black and 
 white building.The timber is oak and  
 some of the original wood is there.The
 walls were made out of wattle and     
 daub. At first it is thought that it  
 was a priest's house or where the     
 visiting priests would stay.In 1667 a 
 man called James Turner left Â£20 a    
 year for ever to turn it into a free  
 school for boys.The headmaster lived  
 above the school.In 1909 the girls had
 a school down the lane and the boys   
 moved down and stayed there.In the    
 second world war the hall became a    
 food store.Later,school meals were    
 served there.They had good meals to   
 eat and were looked after well.The    
 Village Hall is now used for          
 meetings,concerts,Women's Institute   
 and play group.
