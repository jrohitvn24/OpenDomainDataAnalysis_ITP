In Wicksteed Park,there are plenty of  
exciting paying amusements e.g. Pirate 
Ship,Roller Coaster and Cine 2000.Last 
year the train was the most popular    
attraction,carrying 4,000,000 people   
all around the park.There are tennis   
courts,crazy golf,BMX track,boat trips 
on the lake, water slides and many     
other rides.On average a ride cost 40p 
and a book of tickets cost $ 1.50.There
are 14 eating places,selling things    
like ice cream, candy floss,take away  
hot foods right up to a full scale     
restaurant meal.Wicksteed park also    
makes its own ice cream,making 9000    
litres monthly in summer.In the        
function halls,dinner dances are held  
and often booked 10 years ahead.Usually
1,750,000 attend yearly,but in the last
few years numbers have fallen because  
of unemployment in the area.           </content>
