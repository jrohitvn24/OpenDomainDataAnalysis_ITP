		<content> The church at Winwick is dedicated to 
 St. Oswald who was the Christian King 
 of Northumbria and was thought to     
 have been killed in battle against a  
 Pagan king somewhere near the church  
 in the year 642A.D.  There has been a 
 church on this site for nearly l300   
 years.  Inside the church there is a  
 remnant of a Saxon Preaching Cross    
 believed to be about  1000  years     
 old.The first church was mentioned in 
 the original Domesday Book of 1086.In 
 the graveyard there are gravestones   
 which date back to 1600. Inside the   
 church there are brasses, one of which
 is unique, which means there is no    
 other like it.  It shows a priest,    
 robed for Mass, wearing the spurs of a
 knight and wearing the tonsure. This  
 is the Legh Brass. Sir Peter Legh     
 became a priest after his wife died.
