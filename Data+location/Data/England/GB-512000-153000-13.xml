		<title>13The Village Hall, Gt.Bookham</title>
		<content> The old{Barn Hall}in Church Rd is the 
 principal venue for village clubs and 
 groups, private parties and meetings. 
 The Barn was converted in 1906 by a   
 local land owner and presented to the 
 village.                              
                                       
 Since 1906, the Hall has been extended
 by public subscription. It is now a   
 large complex, comprising the Barn    
 Hall with a stage, the Harrison Room, 
 2 kitchens and a caretakers flat.     
                                       
 Leatherhead District Council were the 
 trustees until 1948 when the building 
 was handed over to the newly formed   
 Bookham Community Association. In 1985
 the B.C.A. is raising funds to restore
 the fabric of the Barn Hall.          
                                       
 To the W. of the Hall is a field where
 the Village Day Fete is held in June. </content>
