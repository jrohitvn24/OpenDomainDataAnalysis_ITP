		<title>09The Colne Valley - Transport</title>
		<content>    The Colne Valley has long provided 
 a route across the Pennines linking   
 Huddersfield and Manchester.          
    The A62 Manchester road was opened 
 in 1821 as part of a turnpike road to 
 replace an old chain road. It carries 
 heavy traffic to Manchester, although 
 the M62 motorway has reduced the      
 amount considerably.                  
    The railway connects Huddersfield  
 to Manchester with local stops at     
 Slaithwaite. It was opened in 1849. It
 has a regular passenger service and   
 carries freight also. It now has two  
 tracks which are not electrified.     
    The Huddersfield Narrow Canal was  
 opened in 1794 linking Huddersfield   
 with Ashton Under Lyme. It was closed 
 in 1944, but is now undergoing        
 restoration. The towpath still        
 provides a popular walk.
