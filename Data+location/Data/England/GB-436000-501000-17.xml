		<content> At 7a.m. I make breakfast for my 2    
 children, who both attend school.     
 Andrew goes to Brompton C.P.School and
 Nicola to Allertonshire School. They  
 both take the same bus to school at   
 8.20a.m.                              
 At 9.30.a.m. I drive to Brompton      
 School to help the Infant class with  
 their baking session, which I do once 
 a fortnight. Then on to Northallerton 
 to shop and have lunch.               
 This afternoon I am helping to prepare
 food for a"Sangria Evening"which Major
 &amp; Mrs.Arkwright are holding to help   
 funds for a better Village Hall.      
 I then make tea for 3,as my husband   
 works away for 2 weeks at a time on an
 Oil Rig as an Instrument Engineer.A   
 car is essential,as most evenings I   
 have to take the children to some     
 activity                              
 e.g.,swimming,cubs,guides,tennis.     </content>
