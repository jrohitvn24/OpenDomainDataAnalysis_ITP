		<title>06A MENDIP DAIRY FARM</title>
		<content> Bristol Plain Farm is located on the  
 Mendip plateau at a height of about   
 250 metres 2 miles from Cheddar. The  
 farm extends to 290 acres and supports
 262 cattle. Of these,130  are dairy   
 cattle in milk,100 are followers for  
 herd replacement,30 are reared for    
 beef cattle and there are 2 bulls.    
 Most of the cattle are Frisian as     
 these yield the most milk. Each cow   
 produces approximately 1000 gallons   
 each year. The soil is a medium loam  
 but is thin and stoney in many places 
 so that much of the land is rough     
 grazing. The high rainfall            
 (approx.1250 millimetres per year)    
 leaches nutrients from the soil so    
 that fertilizer and lime applications 
 are important for the production of   
 quality grass.
