		<content> In the morning the doctor holds       
 consultations with  patients at the   
 surgery.The most common illnesses are 
 colds, chest and throat infections,   
 virus diseases and bacterial diseases 
 (tonsilitis,laryngitis). Also bone and
 joint diseases ,rheumatism, arthritis,
 slipped discs.                        
 Some patients are referred to the     
 local hospital for second opinions or 
 for x-rays and blood tests.           
 After surgery the doctor continues    
 with home and hospital visiting. Some 
 of these patients are seriously ill or
 elderly and the doctor sometimes has  
 to attend accidents. Much of the      
 doctors work is of a preventive nature
 e.g. innoculation of babies against   
 whooping cough, diptheria, measles and
 poliomyelitis. The doctors bag        
 contains a stethoscope,syringes,drugs 
 etc.                                  </content>
