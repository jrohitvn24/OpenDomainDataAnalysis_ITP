		<title>16LAW &amp; ORDER.CALCOT,READING</title>
		<content>    Whilst some areas of Reading do    
 have problems with 'law and order',   
 fortunately,Calcot is not one of them.
    The local officer in the Calcot    
 area would put the crime rate at about
 2%.Major crime is rare.Most crime     
 takes the form of theft,and minor     
 damage.Vandalism is not a major       
 problem.However,there are more causes 
 for concern in the greater Tilehurst  
 area.                                 
    Local policemen have begun a new   
 campaign to go into schools far more. 
 The aim behind this plan is for there 
 to be more interaction between police 
 officers and young people.Police      
 officers also bring in films dealing  
 with a whole range of issues,both     
 relevant to crime and to young peoples
 safety.                               
    The Police have also reintroduced  
 'beat policeman',which is well liked. </content>
