		<content> There are many other things we could  
 have mentioned in our Domesday        
 Project. In our area Village Halls are
 very important in Community Life. West
 Burton, Aysgarth &amp; Thoralby all have  
 village halls, which are in regular   
 use for meetings, dances, concerts,   
 evening classes and activities such as
 badminton, keep fit &amp; country dancing.
 We could also have studied mobile     
 services, eg mobile shops (the        
 library, greengrocer, butcher, baker  
 &amp; mobile fish &amp; chip shops call each  
 week).                                
 The main work has been done by Kate   
 Huntington, Siobhan Pattison, Claire  
 Cooper, Maria Wilson, Sarah           
 Stemmer-Baldwin and David Clarkson,   
 helped by Mrs Beth Miller and Miss    
 Josephine McSweenie. Mrs Sally Stone, 
 Miss Judith Bell and the Junior       
 Class have all helped.                </content>
