		<title>15Bridge Street Development</title>
		<content> In 1985 Bridge Street in Darwen was   
 made into a Pedestrian area.Before    
 this happened it was a very           
 busy,noisy,dangerous and narrow       
 road.Lorries and cars used to park on 
 the pavements and cause traffic       
 jams.Bridge Street is very commercial 
 with shops along both sides of the    
 Street.Many shops mean lots of        
 people,so it has been made into a     
 pedestrian area for safety.It is now a
 much better area and looks a lot nicer
 with yellowy stones on the ground in a
 fancy pattern and old fashioned lamps 
 and posts.the street has had alot of  
 new shops like hairdressers and a     
 computer shop since it has been       
 altered.Another road was made to      
 replace the road where the pedestrian 
 area has been built.It seems much     
 better as a Pedestrian area.
