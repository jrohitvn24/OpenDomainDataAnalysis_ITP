		<content>  The Lewis's own 250 pigs, 110 cattle,
 2 geese,2 horses,some hens and 150    
 acres of corn.Most of the pigs are    
 Large Whites,they keep a few          
 Gloucester Old Spots.Some pigs are    
 kept for breeding,most are sold.      
 Piglets are born in May or June.They  
 stay in a small pen for 6 weeks,then  
 are placed in mixed pens with other   
 sows and piglets.If the mother does   
 not look after the piglets then she is
 sold as meat.When the piglets are 6   
 months old they are separated from the
 sow to be sold as bacon and pork.     
 Fresians and Hereford Crosses are also
 kept.Calves feed from their mothers   
 and are weened off after 6 weeks.The  
 Lewis's made silage for the first time
 this year.This is kept until winter   
 and then fed to the animals.
