		<title>19Housing in the Hextable area</title>
		<content>  The area of Hextable in our D-block  
is 3 miles from Swanley with all kinds 
of houses,terraces,cottages and        
semi-detatched houses.There was a very 
small thin house with a very thin door 
as well as pebble dash houses.         
  The private houses have their own    
style and the occupants can do what    
they like to them.The people who live  
in council houses are not allowed to do
anything to them,unless they buy them. 
  All the houses and bungalows were    
made of bricks with tiled roofs.They   
all had 2 gardens.Some of the flats    
had balconies,there were 4 blocks of   
flats all built with bricks.           
  The biggest group were semi-detatched
houses built between 1950-1980.The next
largest group were bungalows built     
between 1930-1950 and the 3rd group    
were detached houses built between 1960
-1980.                                 </content>
