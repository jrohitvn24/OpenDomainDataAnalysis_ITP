		<title>03The Dymock Poets 1911-1914</title>
		<content> The Dymock poets is the name          
 given to a famous group of            
 poets who lived in the area           
 between 1911 and 1914. Lascelles      
 Abercrombie was the first to arrive.  
 He came first to Much Marcle          
 before settling down in Dymock in     
 1911. He lived in The Gallows in      
 Ryton. He was joined by Wilfred Wilson
 Gibson, Rupert Brooke, John Drink _   
 water and Edward Thomas. They         
 published poems, many of them about   
 this area, in news letters which went 
 out all over the world.               
  The group broke up when World War 1  
 began in August 1914. Both Rupert     
 Brooke and Edward Thomas were killed  
 in the War.
