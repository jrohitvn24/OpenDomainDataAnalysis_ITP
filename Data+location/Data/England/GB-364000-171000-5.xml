		<content> Built in 1983, covering a 3.8 acre    
 site, the Civic Centre houses the     
 offices of{local government,}looking  
 after a population of 87,244.There are
 6 departments:administration, finance,
 environmental health, planning (land  
 development), housing and technical   
 (recreation, roads, refuse).Employed  
 within are 200 manual and 200         
 administrative staff. In charge are 47
 elected{Councillors,}who meet every 6 
 weeks in the Council Chamber.The      
 running cost, plus wages, for 1984/85 
 is approx.Â£300,000.This is paid for   
 from the{Rates,}a tax paid by every   
 householder.The Centre often hires out
 its rooms for poetry recitals, guest  
 speakers, weddings and exhibitions (in
 May 1985 a display of local school art
 work and in June, photos, maps and    
 objects of a Victorian Kingswood.)
