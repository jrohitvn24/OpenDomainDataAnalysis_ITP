		<content> He then chops logs for the fires in   
 the house.The centre is open from     
 February to October.He nearly always  
 has a group in the centre.He also does
 some fell walking.Lost people often   
 come to the centre asking for         
 directions,and using his payphone.He  
 and his wife also do some             
 shopping,every now and then.He has to 
 keep the schoolroom clean,and show    
 groups around and collect eggs.He gets
 about 10 a day off the hens and 2 off 
 the ducks.Towards the end of the      
 day,he turns the generator on.That is 
 the end of Mick Mills day.
