 ...In the Threemilestone Methodist    
 Church, Mrs. Trevethan also belongs   
 to the Church Cowethas (lit. Cornish; 
 'meeting of ladies'). She often gives 
 help at the Boskenneth centre for     
 mentally handicapped people in        
 Redruth.                              
      Mrs. Trevethan's hobbies are     
 knitting, sewing, walking and interior
 decorating (at home). Her usual       
 domestic shopping routine is a weekly 
 drive into Truro for special shopping,
 but otherwise she collects            
 'essentials' from her local village   
 Post-office, butcher and baker, in    
 Threemilestone.                       
      As regards relaxing, you can see 
 that Mrs. Trevethan is extremely busy!
 However, this April the Trevethan     
 family had their first holiday for 10 
 years at a Methodist hotel in N.Wales.</content>
