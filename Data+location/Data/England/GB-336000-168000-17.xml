		<title>17THE HARBOUR</title>
		<content>{The Harbour}lies just beyond the      
 pumping station at the mouth of the { 
{Blind Yeo River in the West End of    
{Clevedon.                             
 It is a natural harbour in that there 
 are no walls or man-made moorings. It 
 is used by private boat owners with   
 small yachts and motor boats who tie  
 up in and around the runnels in the   
 extensive mudflats left when the tide 
 goes out.                             
 The Bristol Channel tide has cut many 
 deep,but narrow channels and because  
 of the unusually large tide range     
 along this coast the boats must be    
 moored on long ropes to cope with the 
 large daily rise and fall.            
 From the harbour you can walk along   
 the sea wall towards {Sand Bay}past   
 more mudflats.
