		<title>05Anfield Farm, Cockermouth</title>
		<content> Anfield Farm is the closest to the    
 town and I went to see how much       
 livestock was on this farm.           
 I took the public footpath which      
 climbs Slatefell and walked through   
 rough pasture. Many Friesians were    
 grazing. I climbed the lower slopes,  
 crossed a stile into a large silage   
 field and followed a hidden track to  
 the sheds.                            
 As I turned the corner I was greeted  
 by four dogs and the farmer's wife.She
 showed me Bess's six puppies four days
 old.She told me cattle rearing was the
 family's work and showed me the sheds 
 where 500 spend the winter. All the   
 family feed,milk and clean every day. 
 There was one shed full of beautifully
 coloured pedigree calves. The V.I.P.is
 Meadowlake Butler,the Holstein Bull.  
 Anfield cattle win Cockermouth Show   
 Championships in most years.          </content>
