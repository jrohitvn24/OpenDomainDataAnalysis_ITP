		<title>04Royal Air Force Wyton</title>
		<content> In this area of North St Ives there is
 RAF WYTON which is a main feature of  
 our 'D'block.It is quieter at RAF     
 WYTON as the runway is being          
 resurfaced.That means no planes on    
 the rampage.There are three main roles
 at RAF WYTON.One is PHOTO RECONNAISSA 
 -NCE which is done by the CANBERRA.   
 Probably the most important thing is  
 TRANSPORT which is carried out by the 
 HERCULES.Then finally SPY PLANES which
 are NIMRODS.They see what the other   
 countries are doing and track down    
 foreign submarines with their sonar.  
 This week,as I write this,the Nimrod  
 is searching underwater for little    
 bits of a Jumbo Jet.The BOEING 747 cr-
 ashed about 30 miles from destination.
 The plane was going to Heathrow to get
 more fuel,and it's feared everyone on 
 board is "DEAD".nearly all of them    
 were from DELHI,INDIA.                </content>
