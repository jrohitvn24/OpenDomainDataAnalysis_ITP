		<content> There are a large number of small     
 farms which the farming families run  
 vurtually by themselves with very     
 little outside help. There are also a 
 number of smallholders who hire       
 themselves out to the farms when extra
 help is needed through sickness or    
 holiday absence. The farmers have been
 progressively digging up the hedgerows
 and making their fields bigger in     
 order to use the bigger machinery,    
 there is not really a great deal of   
 arable farming except in the south of 
 the area where the small valleys are  
 widening. here the crops are gathered 
 in quickly because the machinery is   
 usually on hire and there is extra    
 work for the casuals. In recent times 
 the area has been attracting people   
 who don't need to be based in a large 
 town ie sales representatives whose   
 area is the south west counties.      </content>
