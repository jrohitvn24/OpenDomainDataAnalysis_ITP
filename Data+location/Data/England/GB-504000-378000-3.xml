		<content> Most of the 27 householders of        
 Snelland own one or more cars.  Those 
 without cars are served by one service
 bus a week, presently on a Friday,    
 into and out of Lincoln.  There is    
 also one free bus a week run by one of
 the large supermarket chains.         
                                       
 The railway station at Snelland was   
 closed 18 years ago.  Until then the  
 children travelled by train to Lincoln
 or Market Rasen to attend school.     
 There is bus transport to Faldingworth
 Junior School (3 miles) and to De     
 Aston Comprehensive School, Market    
 Rasen (8 miles).                      
                                       
 Bicycles are used by many inhabitants 
 to get to neighbouring villages such  
 as Langworth which has a Post Office, 
 bakery and general stores.
