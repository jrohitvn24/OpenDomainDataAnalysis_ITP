		<content> The Settle to Carlisle railway, which 
 passes through Stainforth and         
 Langcliffe was one of the outstanding 
 engineering feats of the Victorian    
 Age. It reaches an elevation of 1,169 
 feet between the north-south valleys  
 of the Ribble and the Eden; the       
 Ribblehead Viaduct, now sadly in need 
 of repair (but still carrying trains) 
 is one of the main features of the    
 line, together with the Blea Moor     
 tunnel and the 'Long Drag' up from    
 Settle past Ribblehead. It was        
 completed in May, 1876, having taken  
 six and a half years to complete at a 
 cost of nearly Â£3.5 million and       
 hundreds of lives of the navvies who  
 worked on the line. The railway is now
 threatened with closure, though there 
 is a very active group which          
 co-ordinates pressure to keep it open.
