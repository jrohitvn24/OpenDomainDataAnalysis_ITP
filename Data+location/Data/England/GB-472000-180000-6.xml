		<content>On our survey we recorded how the farm 
land is used.We saw land belonging to  
Hernes Estate, Highlands Farm, Cowfield
Farm, Upper House Farm and Kings Farm. 
   Most of the land is used for arable 
purposes but some is grassland.The     
arable crops are mostly barley but     
there is also wheat, corn, broad beans 
and rape.                              
   We saw cattle on some of the grass  
land including calves and two fields of
sheep.In one field there were three    
horses.                                
Some farmers were haymaking, cutting   
and drying grass for winter feed for   
their animals.                         
   The farm houses were very old, very 
big and smart.
