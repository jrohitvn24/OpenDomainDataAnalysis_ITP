		<content>   We are six in our family, mother,   
 father, two sisters and one brother.  
 My father works at Maple Mill, a      
 cotton wool factory on Oldham. Mother 
 works in a knitwear factory which is  
 also in Oldham. My sister, me, and my 
 brother go to Fitton Hill School, and 
 my younger sister is at the Juniors.  
   This year, a month in May and June  
 is a special month for muslims. It is 
 the month of Ramadan. We fast for 30  
 days from dawn to sunset, breakfast at
 2am and dinner at 10pm! Then we have  
 Eid, our Christmas. We are given new  
 clothes and money. Relatives visit our
 house and enjoy themselves. We have a 
 great time over Eid and the funny     
 thing about it is that we get two     
 Christmases each year!
