		<content>   Although on the edge of the popular 
 tourist area of Exmoor, this area is  
 too sparsely populated for there to be
 a great concentration of summer visit_
 ors.Even so,the first floor of one    
 cottage is let as a self_contained    
 flat.Half of one farm house is let to 
 summer visitors and a prefabricated   
 bungalow on the next_door farm is also
 let.                                  
   On one farm,visitors are welcomed in
 the house,while the family use an old 
 railway carriage during the summer.   
 Another farmhouse has a wing converted
 for holiday visitors.                 
   The only other facilities for       
 tourists in this square are on the    
 A361,where there is a licenced rest_  
 aurant and a filling station.Two young
 people have worked in a wine bar in   
 Dulverton in the school holidays, and 
 one works in the local inn.           </content>
