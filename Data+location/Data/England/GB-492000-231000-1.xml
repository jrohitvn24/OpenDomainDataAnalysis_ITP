		<title>01Woburn and its Environs.</title>
		<content> Woburn is situated on the border of   
 Bedfordshire and Buckinghamshire some 
 15 miles from Bedford and 8 miles from
 Leighton Buzzard.                     
 The village is surrounded by farmland.
 Most of the land belongs to the       
 Marquis of Tavistock who lives at     
 Woburn Abbey. The village is small    
 (800 inhabitants) but a number of the 
 houses are of architectural interest  
 and a large number of tourists visit  
 the Abbey every year. Woburn has a    
 number of shops, the majority of which
 cater for tourists rather than the    
 local residents.                      
 The surrounding area is rolling       
 countryside, open to the south and    
 heavily wooded to the north.          
 In recent years a championship golf   
 course has been built in this woodland
 and now is the venue for major        
 tournaments.                          </content>
