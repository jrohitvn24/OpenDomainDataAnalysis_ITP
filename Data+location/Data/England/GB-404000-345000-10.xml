		<content> A typical job locally is that of sales
clerk at British Industrial Sand.This  
is described as interesting because of 
the many and varied poeple to speak to 
on the telephone.The job is not        
particularly well paid but it is handy 
to most poeple in Oakamoor.There are a 
lot of orders for clay and sand        
everyday. Most of the time staff are   
kept busy because of telephone calls.  
In the summer they are more busy than  
in the winter but they still need alot 
of sand and grit to put on the roads   
when there is snow on the ground.B.I.S.
deliver their products by lorry or     
train to as far away as Cornwall and   
Scotland and countries abroad.  As     
well as sales clerk there are many     
more jobs at B.I.S. like engineers,shot
firers,machine operators,drivers,fore  
-men,directors,gardeners and general   
labourers.                             </content>
