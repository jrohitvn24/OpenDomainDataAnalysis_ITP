		<title>11Life on a Farm</title>
		<content>  We visited Preston East Farm and     
 asked the farmer and his wife some    
 questions.They both liked life on a   
 farm and came from farming families.  
 The farm was over 300 years old,the   
 farmhouse (which was victorian) was   
 the youngest part.The lady who owned  
 the farm had inherited it from her    
 father; Mr and Mrs Willis were tenant 
 farmers.                              
 The farm of 285 acres,was one third   
 grass and two thirds corn,and there   
 were 395 sheep looked after by a dog  
 called 'Tom'.If they did not live on a
 farm they would like to live in the   
 country.They could only go on holiday 
 at certain times of the year,and they 
 have a farm manager whilst they are   
 away.They have a kitchen garden beside
 the farmhouse,but this is the only    
 hobby they have time for.
