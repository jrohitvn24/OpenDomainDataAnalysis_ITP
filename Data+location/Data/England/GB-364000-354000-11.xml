		<title>11The College of Agriculture.</title>
		<content> The Cheshire College of Agriculture is
 at Reaseheath in the south western    
 corner of our area. The estate once   
 belonged to the Wilbraham family. The 
 Wilbrahams were an old Cheshire family
 and even now their name still crops up
 in the Nantwich area. There is a pub  
 called {The Wilbraham Arms}and a road 
 called {Wilbraham Road.}              
 The name {Reaseheath}probably means{  
{The heath where races are held},but no
 one knows for certain.                
 The present college building was built
 over one hundred years ago in 1882. It
 was built in red brick in the Jacobean
 style of architecture.In 1920 it was  
 sold by its owners to the Cheshire    
 County Council for use as an          
 agricultural college. It is known     
 throughout the area as{Reaseheath}and 
 it is open to the public every May.
