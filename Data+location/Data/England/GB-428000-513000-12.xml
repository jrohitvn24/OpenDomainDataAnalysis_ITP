		<title>12Unemployment in Darlington</title>
		<content>{April 1985} Unemployment is very bad  
 this year.  My dad is unemployed and  
 if he didn't have the allotment he    
 would go mad.  My mam is working at a 
 clothes shop under the town clock.    
 The owner is being forced to sell half
 the shop because of the high cost of  
 rates. This could lead to some people 
 being made redundant.  To decrease    
 unemploy- ment I think the rates      
 should be cut.                        
{June1985}My dad has a job as a boiler-
 attendant at the chemical works in    
 Faverdale.  When the family heard I   
 felt very happy. There was an         
 interview between him and another man.
  Now he is on the night- shift for a  
 week, starting at 11 pm and finishing 
 at 7 am.  We found out on June 15th   
 that he had got the job.              
 My mam said it was like Christmas.{
