		<title>09FLAX BOURTON SCHOOL</title>
		<content> The village school in Flax Bourton was
 built in 1859. There are 78 children  
 on roll at the present time.These come
 not only from the village itself but  
 also from Barrow Gurney,Long Ashton   
 and also from Backwell.The school is  
 divided into three classes and is     
 housed on two sites until such time   
 that a new school is built.           
 A wide range of subjects is taught    
 The whole school swims each week at   
 Backwell and this helps to compensate 
 for the lack of facilities at the     
 school.Work is based on various topics
 which cover all areas of the          
 curriculum. Frequent trips are        
 undertaken to the theatre,concerts and
 also residential outings to large     
 cities such as London and York.When   
 they leave Flax Bourton most pupils go
 to Backwell Comprehensive School.
