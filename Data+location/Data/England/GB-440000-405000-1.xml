		<content>{Great Houghton}is in{South Yorkshire, 
 approximately seven and a half miles  
 from Barnsley.It is mainly a{farming  
 and{mining}community . There are only 
 two{schools}in Great Houghton, both   
 of which are primary,taking pupils    
 from 5 to 11 years of age.They are    
 the Church Of England School and the  
 Junior and Infant School.             
 Primary children usually transfer to  
 Darfield Foulstone High School for    
 their{secondary education.}Great      
 Houghton,along with other mining      
 areas,is just recovering from the     
{miner's strike}that lasted from the   
 beginning of March 1984 until the very
 end of February 1985.It could take up 
 to 2 years to properly get over this. 
 There is{woodland}surrounding the     
 village,but many trees have been      
 chopped down to provide fuel during   
 the strike.                           </content>
