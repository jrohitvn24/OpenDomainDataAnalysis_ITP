		<content> Chipley is a very small village,most  
 of the houses are modern except for   
 the farmhouses and Chipley Court(which
 has belonged to the Sandford family   
 for generations).There are lots of    
 fields around the village.Most of the 
 people who live in the village work on
 farms close by.On the farm they grow  
 vegetables and fruit(mainly pears).   
 They also do a lot of silaging.With   
 the silage they make calf pellets.    
 Most of the women are housewives,     
 butthey help with the blackcurrant    
 picking in the summer.Most families   
 have children but there is no school  
 so they go to the nearest town which  
 is Langford Budville.The nearest big  
 town is Wellington,about 3 miles      
 away.The population of the village is 
 only about thirty people.
