		<title>07High Street,Great Ayton.</title>
		<content> Great Ayton{High Street}is a very     
 popular place with both tourists and  
 local people.It is at its busiest on  
 Saturdays.Flowing alongside the High  
 Street is the attractive{River Leven. 
  One of the main attractions,{Captain 
{Cook's}museum is to be found at 99    
 High Street.Outside the shops there   
 are only about 80 parking places for  
 cars.As the road is narrow this often 
 causes severe{congestion.             
                      We visited the   
 High Street on Wednesday June 19th.   
 It was typical afternoon. A student   
 strode into the{old library}counting  
 his pennies. In the{dentist's surgery,
 painless operations were carried out, 
 while in the opticians,eyes were being
 tested. The houses on the High Street,
 mostly stone-built,vary from detached 
 to terraced.Great Ayton High Street   
 is a lively,historical place to visit.</content>
