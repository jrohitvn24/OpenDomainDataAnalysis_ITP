		<title>13WILDLIFE IN WALSGRAVE</title>
		<content> In Walsgrave there is not much        
 wildlife,but behind Asda there is a   
 variety of wildlife.There is a lot of 
 wasteland there where animals can roam
 around.There is a lot of farming land 
 there.Many species are starting to    
 grow on the farmland.                 
 When I explored the countryside I saw 
 a variety of butterflies.They were all
 different colours.I also saw a number 
 of fox and rabbit holes,but I never   
 saw them running about.               
 There were a lot of trees on the      
 landscape.All of them looked the same 
 shape and size.At night you can see   
 the animals running about.            
 There is not a variety of flowers in  
 Walsgrave.Daisies and roses are the   
 most common you can see.We found that 
 in Walsgrave there is not much        
 wildlife but around Asda there is.
