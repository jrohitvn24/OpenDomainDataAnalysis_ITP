		<title>06NEW CHESHIRE SALT WORKS.</title>
		<content> The New Cheshire Salt Works, Lower    
 Wincham, is the third largest salt    
 manufacturer in the U.K. after        
 I.C.I.(who work the country's only    
 remaining salt mine at nearby         
 Winsford) and British Salt at         
 Middlewich, Cheshire. Unlike the Lion 
 Salt Works (q.v.), New Cheshire       
 extract salt from brine using the much
 more efficient vacuum method. The     
 company was founded by Alfred Stubbs  
 in the twenties and has been          
 associated with his family for five   
 generations.  Concentrated brine is   
 pumped up from a borehole beneath the 
 factory, treated with sodium carbonate
 and lime to remove impurities and then
 heated up in the vacuum extraction    
 system. Over 1,000 tons of salt are   
 produced each week, 25% of which is   
 sold through retail outlets under the 
 brand name of "Selva".                </content>
