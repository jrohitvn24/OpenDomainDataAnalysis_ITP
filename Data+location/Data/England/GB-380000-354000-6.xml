		<content> I went to a supermarket to interview a
 cashier. She said she liked her job   
 and she would not like to change it.  
 Sometimes 1,000 people came to shop in
 a day, she usually served about 300   
 people.  Then I saw the lady who sold 
 the cigarettes.  She said about 200   
 people came in every day to buy       
 cigarettes and that she sold about    
 2,000 each day. She also liked her    
 job. She told us that the shop had    
 been broken into two weeks before. The
 customers thought that the shop was   
 often crowded and the service was too 
 slow. They said the prices were very  
 reasonable and that the shop sold the 
 things most people used.  Most of the 
 customers called two or three times a 
 week.
