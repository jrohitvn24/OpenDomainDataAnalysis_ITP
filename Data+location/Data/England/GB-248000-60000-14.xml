		<title>14INDUSTRY IN ROBOROUGH.</title>
		<content> Although Roborough is mainly a        
 residential suburban area, with  open 
 countryside and farmland very close   
 by, there is also quite a lot of light
 industry in the area.                 
 The Belliver Industrial Estate is     
 being developed on land that was      
 farmed until recently. It consists of 
 several small industrial units.       
 Various things are made in the units. 
 Some of them are: kitchen units, car  
 parts and accessories, double glazing,
 bakeries, sweets, cooked meats, and   
 plastic containers.                   
 Beckton Dickinson is a large factory  
 which makes medical equipment.        
 Plessey are building a large new micro
 electronics factory which will bring  
 jobs to a lot of people.              
 Toshiba have a factory in this area   
 too, one of several in Plymouth.
