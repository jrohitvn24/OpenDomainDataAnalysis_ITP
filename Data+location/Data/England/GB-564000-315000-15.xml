		<content>  We spoke to five old people in       
 Middleton and North Runcton about     
 their childhood and their working     
 lives. One spoke about larger families
 when she was young. She was the eldest
 of 11 children.                       
  All referred to the{games}they played
 as children such as marbles,          
 hopscotch, skipping, and bowling      
 hoops. These are rare in the present  
 television age.                       
  Some left{school}as early as 12 years
 old. A few stayed until they were 15. 
 All but one had all their schooling at
 the village school from the age of 5  
 until they started work.              
  The men had been farmworkers, the    
 main{employment}in their villages. One
 of the women had been in service as a 
 maid at Hillington, one had worked in 
 a shop in Kings Lynn, and one had     
 worked as a typist.                   </content>
