		<title>18PONDHEAD POULTRY FARM HOLT</title>
		<content> Mr Battens' farm is mostly poultry.   
 He also has a number of cattle and    
 also market garden. He has sixteen    
 thousand birds from which he gets ten 
 thousand eggs. He then sorts the eggs 
 into seven different grades on special
 weighing machines. The eggs are then  
 put onto trays and travel under a     
 light where they are checked for      
 cracks. They are then weighed again   
 but only the right size eggs are      
 passed through. After that the eggs go
 to the local town shops but not the   
 supermarkets.                         
 The battery hens spread diseases and  
 no-one is allowed to see them. The    
 young chicks are vaccinated against   
 most things but they can still spread 
 diseases. The temperature in the      
 brooder machine has to be 90f.
