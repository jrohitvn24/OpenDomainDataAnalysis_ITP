		<content> We entered a{Road Safety Competition} 
 run by the RAC, and as part of our    
 work we made a{model}of our area.     
 First we went for a walk to note down 
 all the buildings, then built up the  
 model on an old blackboard. We also   
 had to make an{electrically powered   
{vehicle}which we called 'Seaton       
 Delaval Municipal Maintenance         
 Vehicle'. On our model we marked all  
 the places in our town where there    
 were{dangerous crossings.}We marked on
 yellow lines, Zebra crossings and     
 placed all the road signs in the      
 proper places. We received a          
 certificate for our model and it was  
 talked about on a local TV programme. 
 We also found out that through our    
 town in one day, there are 208{public 
{service journeys}and 68 947 in a year!
 There are 11 separate bus routes      
 through our area.                     </content>
