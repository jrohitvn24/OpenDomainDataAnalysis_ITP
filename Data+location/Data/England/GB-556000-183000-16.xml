		<title>16UPMINSTER : URBAN TRANSITION</title>
		<content>   Upminster was still a{farming       
{community}until the railway came in   
 1885. Gradually it lost its agri-     
 cultural associations becoming a      
{dormitory suburb.}Houses near the     
 station date from{1900,}those east of 
 Corbets Tey Road from about{1930.}    
 Shops and offices around the Station  
 Road cross-roads serve this community,
 together with several schools,        
 including Upminster Primary and Gaynes
 Secondary, both dating from the 1920s.
  {The principal roads, St.Mary's Lane,
{Corbets Tey Road and Clay Tye Road    
{have existed for centuries, appearing 
{on 17th century maps.}Names have      
 changed, as have road surfaces; 19th  
 century lanes have been tarred and    
 have traffic signs. Some{pre-1900}    
 housing still exists beside these     
 roads.                                
                                       </content>
