		<title>09RES. IN BURY &amp; HOUGHTON cont</title>
		<content> There is a first school in Bury which 
 educates the majority of the children 
 in Bury, whilst those in Houghton go  
 to Amberley First School. A few of the
 farmers and professional families send
 their children to the private sector  
 of education. The Bury school is 140  
 years old and has currently about 40  
 children who leave at the age of about
 10+ to go to a middle school in       
 Petworth. The majority of the         
 inhabitants own a car, some families  
 two or more, and few use public       
 transport except perhaps for trips to 
 London. There is no local bus service 
 and the nearest railway station is at 
 Amberley some 2 miles away. Their     
 hobbies are also very varied although 
 gardening is the most common. The     
 families with cars generally shop at  
 the nearest super markets whilst those
 without use the one local shop.       </content>
