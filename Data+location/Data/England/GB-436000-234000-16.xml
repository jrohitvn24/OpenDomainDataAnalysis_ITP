		<content> WE MET ADRIAN BECKFORD WHO WAS A      
 SKILLED HEDGELAYER.THE HEDGE STARTS AS
 BUSHES,BRAMBLES &amp; SMALL TREES.THEY ARE
 CUT DOWN &amp; BIG TREES &amp; BUSHES ARE     
 REMOVED.THEN FIRM STICKS ARE HAMMERED 
 INTO THE MIDDLE OFF THE BUSH AND      
 HAZELWOOD IS WEAVED IN &amp; OUT OF THE   
 STICKS.THE BRANCHES HAVE TO BE LAYED  
 ALL IN ONE DIRECTION.THESE HEDGES WHEN
 MADE PROPERLY LAST UP TO 20-30 YEARS. 
 HAZELWOOD IS USED BECAUSE IT IS VERY  
 FLEXIBLE BUT IT IS DIFFICULT TO FIND  
 IN OXFORDSHIRE.THE TERM USED FOR HOW  
 MUCH A HEDGELAYER EXPECTS TO GET DONE 
 IN A DAY IS A CHAIN;THAT MEANS 20     
 YARDS A DAY.IT IS A LONG AND SKILLED  
 JOB WHICH NEEDS A LOT OF PATIENCE.HE  
 IS WORRIED THAT MANY FARMERS ARE      
 DESTROYING THEIR HEDGES TO MAKE MORE  
 LAND. IT ALSO DESTROYS THE WILDLIFE   
 AND THIS IS SOMETHING HE WILL NEVER   
 KNOWINGLY DO.                         </content>
