		<title>16MENDIP HOSPITAL 2</title>
		<content> Other specialisms have now developed, 
 particularly the treatment of         
{alcholics.                            
 Modern drug treatments have allowed   
 people to live normal lives outside   
 such an institution, where formerly   
 they would have been confined.        
 Treatment within the community is felt
 to be more therapeutic than           
 institutionalisation in the Mendip    
 Hospital.  Consequently the hospital  
 is{to close}shortly although there is 
 much local opposition to keep it open.
 At present{200 people}work in the     
 "Mendip" and the loss of the hospital 
 will be a great blow to the area _ not
 least the loss of the{Mendip Hospital 
{Cricket Club}which was once one of the
 strongest local teams.
