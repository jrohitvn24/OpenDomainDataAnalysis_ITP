		<title>06WHITLEY BRIDGE VILLAGE (2)</title>
		<content> There are no supermarkets in the      
 village. There are only two small     
 shops, a Post Office, and a Fish and  
 Chip shop. Also there are two Public  
 Houses both of which sell pub food at 
  lunch time. There  are no Clubs,Wine 
 Bars,or sports centres e.t.c.in the   
 neighbourhood.So,  in the evenings,the
 villagers either spend the time with  
 the family at home, or go to a larger 
 town such as Knottingley or Doncaster.
 At weekends the people have hobbies   
 such as Snooker,Fishing and gardening.
 The number of years that families have
 lived in their house                  
 varies.However,most have been there   
 Thirty years or more. There is a      
 school on the outside of the village  
 but it is only a  small Primary       
 school. The nearest Secondary school  
 is in Knottingley.
