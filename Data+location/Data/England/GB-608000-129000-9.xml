 ourite film.Now around 150,000 people 
 use the railway a year.The track is   
 14.5 miles long.It has a 15.25 inch   
 guage.There are 12 trains each about  
 5ft high and 220 ft long.Coal is the  
 fuel.Each train can carry 200 people. 
 The R.H.&amp; D.R. employs 30 people      
 doubling the number in the Summer.It  
 is used to transport 80 - 100 school  
 children from Dymchurch to Southlands 
 Secondary School at New Romney.There  
 are 5 stations.A return ticket from   
 Hythe to Dungeness costs Â£4.65 for an 
 adult &amp; a third of the price for      
 children.The trains can travel at 25
