		<title>16** Horse Riding.************</title>
		<content>My Mummy has a riding school the ponies
are all mares.  Misty and Shamara      
belong to me, but Rhona belongs to     
Cathy and Richard my friends.  We know 
that Misty is 12 hands and I can take  
the saddle off and the bridle off too. 
                                       
One day I went to a rally and did all  
sort of things and I fell off.  Then we
went down to the log and I jumped it.  
Then we cantered to our Mummies but    
Misty galloped to Mummy.  Then it was  
time to go home.                       
                                       
Then we got to the field.  I galloped  
to the gate where  Shamara was waiting 
for her Mummy.  I jumped off Misty and 
took off her bridle and saddle and let 
her into the field to have something to
eat and me and Mummy went home for tea 
feeling very tired.
