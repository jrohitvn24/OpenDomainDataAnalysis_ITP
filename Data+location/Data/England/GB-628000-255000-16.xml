		<content>Most people seem to watch television in
their spare time, but some children    
actually get up and do something. Adam 
likes fixing bikes, Andrew likes       
reading old books. Sarah, like many    
others collect things like             
rubbers or stickers. Anthony likes     
drawing, reading and coin collecting.  
He draws because he likes designing    
things. William reads and draws        
pictures of palaces and castles. "i    
design houses because you can do them  
anywhere. I tidy up my room only when  
my mum is helping because I am very    
lazy but I know that it looks good     
when we have done it. I also collect   
marbles, they look nice when you hold  
them up to the light and look through  
them."
