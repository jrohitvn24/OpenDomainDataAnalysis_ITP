		<title>15East Street Scheme, Bristol</title>
		<content> Old people and people without cars    
 could go to Asda and they wouldn't    
 have to worry about getting knocked   
 down.  But we think that other shops  
 like Fine Fare, Tescos and Sainsburys 
 (supermarkets) might suffer and some  
 of the small businesses might go      
 bankrupt.                             
 I personally like the East Street     
 Scheme.  The rest of my family also   
 think that the East Street Scheme     
 would be a good thing to happen, if it
 happens.  I think the public meeting  
 was a very good idea.  More than 100  
 people came to the meeting in Holy    
 Cross school on June 20th l985, many  
 people were worried about the diverted
 traffic being near their homes.  Many 
 people said "Why don't they just leave
 East Street alone?"
