		<title>02HOUSES IN BLACKROD</title>
		<content>   Blackrod is mainly a residential    
 area. Most of the men travel to work. 
 Since the{Second World War,}there has 
 been much housing development - mainly
 private, but there is one{Council     
{Housing Estate.}The houses are mostly 
 semi-detached with some bungalows,    
 detached and terraced.                
{  Barn Acre}is an interesting,small   
 housing development that won a{Civic  
{Trust Award}in 1981. It consists of   
 the{Green Barn Farm,}built in 1704    
 with{wattle and daub}inner walls. The 
 old stone farm buildings have been    
 developed into modern luxury homes    
 around a cobbled courtyard - the old  
 farmyard. The{tithe barn,}thought to  
 date back to about 1587 has a{cruck   
{beam roof}which has been left exposed 
 in the upstairs living accomodation in
 one of the three houses made from the 
 barn.                                 </content>
