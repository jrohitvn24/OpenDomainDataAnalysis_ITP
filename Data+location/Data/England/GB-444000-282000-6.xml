		<content> Mr.Mason is now the occupant of what  
 was the old post office.The building  
 is 150 years old and has a thatched   
 roof which was put on in  1976.The new
 Post Office is across the road from   
 the original site and serves as a     
 general store as well as the Post     
 Office.{The Post Office / General     
{store}fulfils a very important role   
 being the only permanent shop of this 
 kind in the village.A number of{mobile
{shops}provide goods for the villagers 
 such as the{Fishmonger}and{Grocer     
 although many people in the village   
 prefer to buy their vegetables from   
 the local{Market Gardener,(George     
{Busby)}who grows and sells most kinds 
 of vegetables.Other mobile services   
 which come into the village are the   
{Library van}and the{School Dentist.
