		<title>13Landscape around Chislehurst</title>
		<content>Chislehurst is quite a friendly place. 
It has a large area of woodland,but    
local history shows that the woodland  
stretched much further than it does    
now.Chislehurst is quite hilly.It is   
notsy ,but not too quiet.              
We can get most of what we need from   
the local supermarket in the High      
Street.If we need to we can get to     
londosily by rail.                     
There is a mixture of                  
housing:Edwardian,Victorian and Post   
War. There are not many modern houses. 
There are many Scout troops,Brownie    
packs and also lots of other clubs.
