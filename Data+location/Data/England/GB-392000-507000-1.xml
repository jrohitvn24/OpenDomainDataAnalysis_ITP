		<content> There is no human habitation within   
 the area, which consists of           
 featureless moorland. The only        
 indications of human activity are cars
 travelling on the Reeth to Tan Hill   
 road and long distance walkers        
 tramping along the Penine Way. Primary
 land usage is sheep grazing, attempts 
 at land improvement can be seen on    
 west moor, where some drainage work   
 has been carried out. Secondary land  
 usage is the raising of grouse for the
 shooting season. To assist the birds  
 the heather is burnt systematically to
 provide young shoots for food and     
 older mature plants for shelter and   
 cover. Pennine Way is a 270 mile      
 footpath, walked by keen ramblers in  
 two and a half-three weeks.
