 The Grantham to Nottingham railway    
 line runs from East to West through   
 the D block. On the line is a signal  
 box. The man operating the box has    
 worked for British Rail for 23 years. 
 He works shifts and each shift        
 normally lasts for 8 hours. Just to   
 the East of the signal box is a branch
 line to Boston. The trains which run  
 on the line carry both passengers and 
 freight. The freight trains transport 
 oil, coal, beer, cars and steel. About
 50 trains pass along the line each    
 day. There are two level crossings in 
 the D block, one at the signal box    
 where the road running North from the 
 A.52. crosses the line and continues  
 North to Vale Farm. The other is in   
 the N.West of the D block where the   
 Viking Way crosses the railway line.
