		<content>Trains: There is no railway station in 
our area but the Cambridge to Ipswich  
line passes through. Much of it is     
single track and there are many level  
crossings including the gated crossing 
by the Woodditton signal box.          
Buses and Coaches: Now that there are  
good roads many people travel by coach.
Express or chartered coaches usually   
travel along the Newmarket by-pass     
which just touches our area. Local     
buses and coaches which stop to pick up
passengers go through the town and     
along the road over the Heath. There   
are 6 services using this route.       
Cars: For most people a car is         
essential either for getting to work or
to the shops. Buses are few and far    
between.
