		<title>17OFFERTON INDUSTRIAL ESTATE</title>
		<content>{Battersby's Hat Factory}first appeared
 in 1895 on Ordnance maps. In its      
 heyday it employed more than 1000     
 people. With the serious decline of   
 the Hatting Industry a number of      
 firms, including Battersby's,         
 amalgamated in 1966 to form the       
{Associated British Hat Manufacturers. 
 The estate is now owned by Ashbank    
 Ltd. They lease units to different    
 firms. There are 27 companies in the  
 estate. These companies make various  
 goods, e.g. steel hand rails,         
 radiators and window frames. Some buy 
 ready made goods from factories to    
 sell to shops, e.g. textile products, 
 chain saws and sewing machines. Some  
 are in the business of servicing      
 industrial machinery. The firms have  
 been in business from 12 months to 15 
 years.
