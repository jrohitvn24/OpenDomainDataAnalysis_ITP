		<title>04LIFEBOAT DAY</title>
		<content>    This event is to raise money for   
 the lifeboat. Porthleven no longer has
 its own lifeboat but the one from     
 Newlyn comes to the harbour each year 
 and you are allowed on it. There are  
 stalls on the harbour head selling    
 lifeboat souvenirs and there are games
 like tombola. There are swimming      
 races, boat races and a raft race, a  
 greasy pole, bicycle riding on a tight
 rope and a mop fight when people in   
 boats try to knock each other out of  
 their boats using wet mops. The       
 helicopter from R.N.A.S. Culdrose     
 gives a rescue display and there is a 
 fancy dress competition for children. 
 People dressed as pirates and clowns  
 go around with collecting boxes and   
 there is also a raffle.
