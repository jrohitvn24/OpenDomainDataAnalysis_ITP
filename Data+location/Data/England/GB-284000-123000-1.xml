		<content>  This is a borderline area both for   
 farming and situation. For the farmers
 it is still possible to keep dairy    
 herds and there are still 4 milking   
 units left. The remaining farmers,    
 however, depend on beef and sheep. the
 area either side of the A361 is poorer
 land, especially to the south and the 
 fields are only suitable for stock    
 during the Summer. The north east     
 section is not a Devonshire County    
 Council responsibility, as this is the
 county border with Somerset The area  
 is further crossed by the main power  
 lines, which also pass through this   
 borderline part of recliamed moorland.
