		<content>   The celebrated miller John Olliver  
 operated the mill on Highdown Hill in 
 the l780's and was buried, some say,  
 upside down, in his own altar tomb on 
 the hillside (still to be seen today).
                                       
   Revenue men fought with over 60     
 smugglers in Ferring in June 1720.    
                                       
   Ferring village is bounded to the   
 north by the A259 and Highdown Hill,  
 to the south by the sea, the east by  
 Goring Gap(farmland) and to the west  
 by the River Rife and the Rife lands  
 (white land).  The parish council  of 
 15 councillors resist all attempts to 
 build to the east and west of the     
 village thus  retaining its           
 individuality and exclusiveness.      
 Known as "north" and "south" Ferring, 
 there are private estates at the sea  
 end and council houses by the railway.</content>
