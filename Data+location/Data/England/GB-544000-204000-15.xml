		<title>15RESTAURANTS AND PUBS</title>
		<content> There is little entertainment in this 
 rural area apart from that offered by 
 its three public houses.              
 The Carpenters Arm in Thornwood offers
 its own atmosphere and a juke box.    
 The Blacksmiths Arms has a wide range 
 of hot and-especially-cold food and   
 while prices are not cheap,the food is
 good and plentiful.For entertainment, 
 the landlord has a room used,one night
 a week each for Jazz and Country &amp;    
 Western music.There are also singers  
 and the hall is open for bookings for 
 clubs,parties and so on.              
 The other pub,the Bull and Horseshoes 
 in Hastingwood,has no special         
 entertainments,but its large car park 
 suggests a good number of regulars.   
 A 1/6 gill serving of spirits in one  
 of the pubs costs about 65-70p,and the
 beer 80-90p for a pint.
