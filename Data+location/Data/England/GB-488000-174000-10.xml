		<title>10Horse Riding.</title>
		<content> Horse riding is a favourite{pastime}in
 and around Fifield. There are several 
{stables}as well as Horse Rangers. I do
 not have a pony of my own so I ride at
 stables in Fifield Road. On Sundays   
 when I go,there are about 50 riders   
 including a disabled boy.There are    
 horses and ponies for us to ride.We   
 use many of the{lanes and bridlepaths}
 in the locality.As well as riding the 
 ponies we learn how to groom them and 
 clean out the stables.We sometimes    
 hold{gymkhanas}at which we can win    
 rosettes.My friend has a pony of her  
 own but it is not kept at the stables 
 where I ride.He is stabled at a yard  
 where there are 10 other ponies.She   
 goes every day to see him except on   
 Tuesdays. She also exercises him along
 the bridleways around Fifield and     
 Holyport. She likes to take him to the
 stream to splash in the water.        </content>
