		<content> The block that we are working on is in
 South Yorkshire,quite close to the    
 border with Nottinghamshire.Rotherham 
 is about 6 miles to the north-west    
 and Sheffield about 10 miles to the   
 west.                                 
 The area consists mainly of farmland  
 used for either pasture or for growing
 cereals.As a contrast to this there is
 a colliery and quarry,as well as an   
 industrial estate.                    
 Within the block there is a section of
 the M18 motorway.There are also parts 
 of the link roads between the M18 and 
 the M1.                               
 There are 5 settlements or parts of   
 settlements.These vary between old,   
 stone-built villages and 20th Century 
 pit villages containing mainly Council
 and NCB housing.
