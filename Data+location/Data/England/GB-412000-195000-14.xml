		<title>14ROUNDHOUSE - MARSTON MEYSEY</title>
		<content>  A {Roundhouse,}built as one of five  
 watchman's round cottages in 1790     
 along the {Severn and Thames Canal,}  
 stands in isolation alongside a       
 humpbacked brick bridge in{Marston    
{Meysey.}This three storey building    
 like a tower is now derelict. The     
 ground floor was used as a stable     
 reached only from outside. The first  
 floor was a single living room and the
 top floor was a bedroom. The rooms    
 have an internal diameter of 16 feet  
 by 10 feet, slightly flattened to     
 accommodate the kitchen range and     
 fireplaces. It is constructed of stone
 covered with plaster and stucco. The  
 parapet at the top enclosed a rain    
 water cistern: where rafters sloped   
 down to the centre to a leaden bowl.  
  The{Roundhouse,}as with some toll    
 houses, gave excellent views up and   
 down the canal.                       </content>
