		<title>14EARDISLEY VILLAGE CHILDREN</title>
		<content> I live in the centre of Eardisley.When
 I have had my breakfast I feed my     
 budgie,it is green and yellow.        
 Sometimes I go round the corner to the
  shops,my Mum has a hairdressers      
 shop.Sometimes I help her in the shop.
 I like to play with my friends in the 
 Avenue.I play on my roller boots or on
 my bike.Then I go home to watch T.V.  
 or go to bed.                         
 My Mum and Dad keep a General Store in
 Eardisley.I have to stock up the dog  
 food.I also have to make a list for my
 Dad to go to the warehouse.I let out  
 the poultry from the tin shed into the
 run.I have to feed my rabbits twice a 
 day.By the time I have done that and  
 had my breakfast it is time for school
 .After school I take  my dog for a    
 walk.On Sundays I go for a bike ride  
 with my Dad.I go train spotting when I
 go to my Aunties but not very often.  </content>
