		<content>     There are very few facilities in  
our area. Two swimming pools are a bus 
ride away but there is no sports centre
near our area.  The local open spaces  
(Wandle Park and Canterbury Park) prov-
ide football and cricket pitches, but  
no organised teams.  A few boys' foot- 
ball teams are  attached to schools.   
There are Brownie, Guide and Scout     
troops, and a Nautical Training Centre 
at Kingsley School. There are two      
Discos, and two Cinemas in the London  
Road. From research we found that older
people liked to spend their leisure    
with other elderly friends at the Bingo
Hall or at "Tea Afternoons". The area  
has plenty of Public Houses and many   
of them have Dart Teams. The main      
centre for teenagers is the Youth Wing 
of Lanfranc School. There is a coffee  
bar, video games and various activities
such as drama, music and art.          </content>
