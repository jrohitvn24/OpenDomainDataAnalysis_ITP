		<title>18St.Andrew's Church Kingswood</title>
		<content>     Despite its{gothic}appearance St. 
 Andrews Church was only built in 1852.
 The reason for the false impression:  
 it was modelled on a genuine medieval 
 church in Shottesbrooke, Berkshire. It
 was built under the direction of one  
 Thomas Alcock who so much loved the   
 church that he had it it copied in    
 his own village of Kingswood. The     
 building is dominated by a very large 
 tower, traditionally placed at the    
 crossing. On top of this stands an    
 octagonal spire which stands out      
 against the{Kingswood sky-line.}The   
 tower houses a peal six C.and G.Mears 
 bells, generally acknowledged as one  
 of the best in Surrey.                
     Three{services}are held each      
 Sunday which are quite well attended. 
 The parish and church is looked after 
 by a{vicar}who lives in the Kingswood 
 estate.                               </content>
