 Th museum is a major source of        
 employment in the area.It employs two 
 hundred staff.This number is made up  
 of 42 permanent staff,57 temporary    
 workers and 101 people employed in    
 'job creation' positions.             
 In the 1984 season  250,000 visitors  
 came to Beamish.Of these 66,000 were  
 from organised school parties from    
 areas as far north as Glasgow and as  
 far south as the Midlands.            
 The museum relies heavily on          
 advertising to attract visitors.It is 
 also featured quite regularly on t.v. 
 programmes.Following a recent 'Blue   
 Peter' programme over 7,500 people    
 attended the Whit Monday opening.     
 Visitors always find the newest ehibit
 the most popular.We found that most   
 letters are about the drift mine.     </content>
