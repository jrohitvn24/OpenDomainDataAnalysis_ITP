		<title>07FULFORD PARISH CHURCH</title>
		<content>The parish church is the only one in   
the Archdeaconry of Stoke-on Trent to  
be dedicated to St.Nicholas.It is of   
ancient foundation and from the        
presence of age old yews in the church 
yard ,it is believed to occupy the site
of a very early Christian place of     
worship.No date can be given for the   
first church building but it was well  
established in the 14th Century as a   
Chapelry.                              
As a Chapelry it was listed among the  
churches of Pirehill Hundred and was   
visited by the commissioners of Edward 
VI.                                    
Soon after the introduction of church  
ornaments and after the inventory of   
the second prayer book,the church      
acquired one silver chalice,one bell   
and one surplice for the curate.The    
church stands on elevated ground and   
has an embattled tower .               </content>
