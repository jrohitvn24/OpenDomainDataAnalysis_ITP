		<title>06Counting Out Rhymes, Knowle</title>
		<content>      A survey was made of counting out
 ryhmes (dips) at Bentley Heath School 
 near Knowle in May 1985 to see which  
 age groups used them to decide a child
 to be "on" or "it" in a game. The     
 youngest class (4-5 years) were too   
 young to use them. About half of Class
 2 (5-6) years) used them whereas in   
 Class 3 (6-7 years) nearly all of the 
 cildren used them. The situation was  
 the same in the 1st and 2nd Year      
 Junior classes (8 and 9 years). About 
 half of the 3rd Year Junior           
 classes (10 years) used them and      
 hardly any of the 4th Year children   
 (11 years) did. In the top 2 years the
 children arranged who was "on" by     
 negotiation.                          
      One example of a dip is as       
 follows: "Eeny, Meeny, Mackeracka,    
 Ominacka, Ominacka, Om, pom, push!".
