		<title>17LIFE STYLES</title>
		<content>{Fashion}has already changed alot in   
 the 1980's.In our school we don't     
 have a school uniform.Everyone wears  
 what they like.Some children wear jump
 suits.Others wear just plain          
 skirts.People are saying that the 60's
 look is coming back into fashion      
 because of the{tight skirts           
 and v backs.People think more about   
  fashion than they did 900years ago!  
 Some young people have their          
 ears pierced about 10 times in each   
 ear.This summer 1985,the shoe craze is
 plastic sandles.Hair styles are       
 different they are'nt what they were. 
 Not straight and boring.They have     
 pink,green,and bleached.Bikes are now 
 a craze.BMX's are the thing.A{BMX}has 
 got very big wheels they some times   
 have stunt nuts on, the seats are very
 hard to sit on.The pop groups I like  
 are{Wham,Frankie.}                    </content>
