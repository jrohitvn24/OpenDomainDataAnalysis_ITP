		<title>12FENWICK ARMS:Country Pub</title>
		<content>Originally a farmhouse,then a transport
cafe it then became a pub.The original 
building was stone.As well as being ex-
tended in recent years it has been re- 
furbished inside and out to give it an 
old world pseudo-Tudor charm from the  
outside.It is a tied pub and restaurant
owned by TetleyÂ£s Brewery and Cavalier 
restaurants who take all profits.Tetley
set targets and pay the landlord bonus 
for increased trade.Tetleys pay bills  
thereby monitoring running costs.The   
pub comprises a bar,lounge,restaurant  
(split into 3 rooms)and private accomm-
odation upstairs for the landlord.The  
clientele are mainly over 25yrs.It is  
difficult to cater for functions since 
the split rooms are too small.Allied   
Leisure pay rent to Tetley to have a   
fruit machine and a video installed.   
Dominoes is also played.In winter 6-   
weekly pub promoting fun nights occur  </content>
