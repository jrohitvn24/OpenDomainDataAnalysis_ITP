		<content> Pupils at Maghull C of E Primary      
 School did the following survey.      
{Lydiate Hall}was built in the 15th    
 century and was open to the public for
 the first time this century.The hall  
 is just off Liverpool Road and has    
 lain in ruins for years.In 1984 the   
 Merseyside Archaeological Society     
 started to excavate in an attempt to  
 clear and date the building.Guided    
 tours were available and finds were on
 display.                              
{The Unsworth Chapel}opened its doors  
 to the public in July 1985.The        
 building dates back to the 13th       
 century,it is named after the Unsworth
 family and is for the use of any      
 Christian.                            
{Maghull Judo Club}was burnt to ruins  
 this summer.Nobody knows the cause but
 the fire destroyed hundreds of pounds 
 worth of kits and equipment.          </content>
