		<content> The area is a positive haven for both 
 flora and fauna because of its        
 relatively unspoilt and undeveloped   
 landscape and also because of the wide
 variety of habitat from open fell to  
 heavy deciduous woodland.             
 Birds seen on one day include         
 Gooseander, Tree Creeper, Merlin,     
 Buzzard, Peregrine Falcon, Yellow     
 Hammer, Lesser Spotted Woodpecker,    
 Greater Spotted Woodpecker, Siskin,   
 heron and Tawny Owl as well as many   
 more common species.                  
 Animals seen in the area include      
 Daubentons Bat, Long-Eared Bat, Otter,
 Badger, Deer, Stoats, Weasel,         
 Pipistrelle Bat, Marten, Fox and Hare.
 There are many rare species of plant  
 in the area, some of which are highly 
 protected species.
