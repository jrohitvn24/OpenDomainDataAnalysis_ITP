		<content> Most villagers shop in Chelmsford     
 but this is a caror bus ride away. The
 Green has several amenities that      
 together provide most of the things   
 that people may need inbetween these  
 shopping trips. There are several     
 shops including a grocer's selling    
 things from bread to vegetables and   
 even take away soup and sandwiches.   
 There is a post office which is handy 
 for old people and mothers, a library,
 banks, building societies and a       
 hairdressers. Two garages sell petrol 
 and service and repair cars. The Green
 has a good Indian restaurant and      
 several public houses. The village    
 hall is an important building because 
 not only is a baby clinic and play    
 school held there but it is also used 
 for meetings, jumble sales and all the
 other things that help keep the       
 community spirit of our village alive.</content>
