		<content>      Ripponden Bank is part of        
 Ripponden Village. It is 3 miles west 
 of Stainland. The village is situated 
 in the bottom of a steep sided valley.
 There is a river running through the  
 middle of the village called the      
 Ryburn. There are two bridges crossing
 the river. One is old, cobbled, and   
 narrow, and was built for horse drawn 
 traffic. The other one is wider,      
 covered with tarmac, and is used for  
 motor vehicles.                       
      By the side of the river is St.  
 Bartholomew's Church. There have been 
 four churches on this site, the       
 present one was built in 1867. Near   
 the church is a community centre which
 is used for Cubs, Scouts, Brownies,   
 Baby Clinic, Toddlers' Club, Play     
 School, Jumble Sales and Sunday       
 School.
