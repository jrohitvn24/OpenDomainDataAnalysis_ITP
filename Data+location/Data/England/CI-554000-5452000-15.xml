		<title>15OUR DAY AT ST OUEN'S BAY</title>
		<content> We are Emma (8 years) and Simon (6    
 years) and we live in St Helier.      
                                       
 Our Mummy and Daddy drove us to a     
 Barbeque at the Barge Aground in St   
 Ouen's Bay.                           
                                       
 First we played with Tammy and our    
 other friends from the Jersey Spina   
 Bifida Association and then Simon and 
 Tammy had sausages and beefburgers and
 Emma had chicken. We had Coke and     
 Fanta to drink and after, Auntie Jo   
 came around with some delicious ice   
 cream.                                
                                       
 When we had finished our food we all  
 had a ride on Thimble who had come    
 from the Riding for the Disabled      
 Association.                          
                                       
 We played in the sand until the end.  </content>
