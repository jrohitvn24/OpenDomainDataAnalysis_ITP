		<title>09Cross Keys Area</title>
		<content>   On the road down to Delph, which is 
 the{old main road from Manchester to  
{Leeds,}there is a factory owned by    
 Cunnington and Cooper who make metal  
 components for the nuclear fuel       
 industry. There are also a public     
 house called the{'Cross Keys'}which   
 also serves food in its restaurant.   
   Most of the buildings in the area   
 date from the{late 18th Century and   
{Victorian}times built mainly of the   
 local{Millstone Grit.}The increasing  
 popularity of the area as a{dormitory 
 for Oldham has resulted in many more  
 modern houses being built in recent   
 years.                                
   In the bottom of the valley is the  
 River Tame and the disused track of   
 the old{'Delph Donkey'}railway line   
 which connected Delph to Oldham.
