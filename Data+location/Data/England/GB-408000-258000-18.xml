		<title>18Going to School, N. Alcester</title>
		<content>      Families living in any of the 3  
 villages in the area have to make a   
 variety of arrangements for children  
 attending state schools.              
      Great Alne and Coughton each have
 their own primary school, whilst young
 children in King's Coughton have to   
 attend school in Coughton or Alcester.
 The 3 villages are in the catchment   
 area of Alcester Grammar School, so   
 the children have to sit an "11 plus" 
 exam. Some children are selected for  
 the grammar school, whereas the       
 parents of the rest have to choose a  
 high school, the nearest being        
 situated in Alcester and Studley.     
      Some village children have to    
 travel to school much further than    
 others. When distance is too great for
 walking or cycling, most children are 
 "ferried" by parents with cars.
