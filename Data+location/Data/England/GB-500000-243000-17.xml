		<title>17Wootton village fair</title>
		<content> The village fair is where everyone in 
 the village gets together and has a   
 nice time. It happens every summer.   
 It starts with a parade through the   
 village. Children dress up to go on   
 the floats. There is a competition for
 the best decorated float and the one  
 that wins leads the parade. This year 
 the Memorial Hall Playgoup came first 
 and our school came second. St. Mary's
 Playgoup came third and the cubs came 
 fourth. Amanda Bird came first in the 
 drawing competiton with a nice picture
 of a hegehog. My sister won a toy dog 
 for guessing its age correctly.There  
 was an inflatable fun castle for the  
 children,and two horses to ride.There 
 were many other things too -          
 rides,competiton,games,stalls and     
 refreshments.
