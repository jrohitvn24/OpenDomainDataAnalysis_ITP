		<title>16A LOCAL RIDING SCHOOL</title>
		<content>There is a riding school along the     
Weedon Rd. in Nether Heyford; it is    
licensed for lessons &amp; hacks. The      
house was built in 1979 by a builder   
from Crick; it was built after the     
stables . The first horse they bought  
in 1979 is now 26 years old. The       
owners like their surroundings and     
would not like to live anywhere else.  
They have other animals - rabbits,     
ducks, a pig and some cattle. In their 
spare time they show-jump; occasionally
they do their own shows. If you go for 
riding lesson it costs 3.50 for        
children and 3.75 for adults. For a    
week's course it is 45 pounds; for a   
day it is 5 pounds. Their customers    
come from Daventry, Towcester, Weedon  
and Flore, as well as from Heyford.    
N.B. There is another Riding School in 
Upper Heyford, but it has not been     
going quite so long.                   </content>
