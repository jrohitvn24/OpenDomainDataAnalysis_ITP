		<title>16CHANGING TIMES IN FARLEY</title>
		<content> We chose the year 1953 and interviewed
 three people to find out the changes  
 between now, 1985, and then. The      
 people were Mrs. G.Williams (aged 80),
 Mr. F.C.Bray (76) and Mr. Francis Bray
 (38), father and son.                 
 They say the population has not       
 changed in size but the people have   
 changed. There are more newcomers and 
 the village is less working class.    
 They all feel that there is less of a 
 village atmosphere now.               
 The land is still used for farming,   
 now more technical. Less people work  
 on the farms now. Mrs. Williams said  
 there were more sheep years ago.      
 Transport has changed drastically. Mr.
 Francis Bray said there were only two 
 cars in the village, although his     
 father Mr. Bray had a lorry as he was 
 the local "carrier". They all remember
                                       </content>
