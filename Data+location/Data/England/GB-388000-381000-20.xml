		<content> They are an enthusiastic team.   The  
 station has won First Prize in        
 British Rail (Manchester Division) for
 cleanliness and tidiness each year    
 from 1979 until 1983 when this award  
 was no longer presented.              
 The station has displays of railway   
 memorabilia which include metal       
 advertising signs typical of the      
 1930's.   It has hand-trucks, milk    
 churns, old-fashioned wicker hampers  
 and trunks displayed on the platforms.
 Leading Railwayman Glyn Derbyshire has
 played a key role in collecting these 
 items.   He has three large albums of 
 black and white photos showing Poynton
 Station in the days of steam trains.  
 His enthusiasm has aroused a great    
 deal of local support from the public.
 There has been T.V. and newspaper     
 coverage of his efforts to make       
 Poynton Station a living museum.      </content>
