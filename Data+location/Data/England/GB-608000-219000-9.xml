		<content>  FARMING IS BY FAR THE GREATEST       
 PROVIDER OF EMPLOYMENT WITHIN THE     
 AREA. THERE ARE A LARGE NUMBER OF     
 PERMANENT JOBS WHICH INCREASES        
 DRASTICALLY DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS  
 WHEN EXTRA WORKERS ARE NEEDED IN THE  
 FIELDS.  THE SMALL INDUSTRIAL SETATE  
 PROVIDES A LARGE NUMBER OF JOBS IN THE
 LIGHT ENGINEERING TRADE AS WELL       
 AS THE OFFICE BACKUP STAFF. ALMOST ALL
 OF THE EMPLOYMENT WITHIN THE AREA GOES
 TO LOCAL PEOPLE,WITH MANY OTHERS      
 HAVING TO TRAVEL OUT OF THE AREA TO   
 FIND EMPLOYMENT.  SOME TRAVEL TO      
 LONDON, OTHERS NEARER TO COLCHESTER   
 AND CLACTON. THERE ARE A CONSIDERABLE 
 NUMBER OF SELF-EMPLOYED PEOPLE IN     
 TRADES SUCH AS ELECTRICIAN, CARPENTER,
 PLUMMER AND BUILDER.  AS WITH MANY    
 OTHER PLACES THERE IS A DEGREE OF     
 UNEMPLOYMENT WITHIN THE AREA, SOME    
 QUITE LONG TERM.                      </content>
