		<title>14WALPOLE NEWS</title>
		<content> Each month a small group of volunteers
 organise the making of the WALPOLE    
 NEWS. This local newsheet, of three   
 or four pages of duplicated foolscap  
 news, is distributed to every home in 
 the parish. It is free but its revenue
 comes from the sale of advertising    
 space.  The advertisers are mostly    
 local.  The news is sent in to the    
 organisers MRS. IRENE HUNTER and MRS  
 AUDREY CLARK. There is, in addition, a
 small competition.  These             
 contributions are normally typed and  
 duplicated at home before being sent  
 out in the village.  For many people  
 they are the only way of keeping in   
 close contact with the organisations  
 in the village and of the events held 
 locally.
