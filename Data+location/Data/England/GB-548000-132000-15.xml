		<title>15A NURSERY IN WITHYHAM/ST.JN.</title>
		<content> My mother and father own and run a    
 small{nursery}for growing{plants.}They
 grow alpine plants for putting in     
 rockeries and small flower beds and   
 they also grow dwarf conifers. They   
 started the nursery in 1973 before I  
 was born, in Mayfield, but it grew so 
 much that they had to move some of the
 plnts to our home in Crowborough. The 
 plants are propagated during the      
 spring and summer from{cuttings}and   
 seed. They start growing in seed trays
 on a warm bed and when the baby plants
 are large enough to handle they are   
 poted intp small pots and sold.
