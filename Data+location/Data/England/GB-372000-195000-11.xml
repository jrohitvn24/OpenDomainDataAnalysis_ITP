		<title>11Recreation-N.Nibley.</title>
		<content> For recreation many people spend their
 time on Stinchcombe Hill playing golf,
 walking along the Cotswold Way or     
 visiting the Tyndale Monument.North   
 Nibley has its own football club with 
 4 teams,the age groups ranging from   
 under 12s to the seniors.A new field  
 is needed as they use a farmer's      
 field.The cricket team use a hay field
 which is a disadvantage as they have  
 to delay play until the hay is        
 harvested.A swimming pool is also     
 needed as the nearest are in Stroud,  
 Thornbury or Gloucester.Most of the   
 sports are played at the Dursley      
 sports centre.Some people attend the  
 Dursley and District Athletics club   
 which coaches track,field and cross   
 country events.Another popular pastime
 is horse riding although there are no 
 riding schools in the area.
