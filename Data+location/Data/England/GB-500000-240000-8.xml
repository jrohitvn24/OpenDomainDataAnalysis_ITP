		<title>08STEWARTBY: CHILDRENS VIEWS</title>
		<content> Written by Jackie Daniels age 14.     
 I asked a number of people what they  
 thought of living in Stewartby.  Their
 answers were very much the same.      
 "It's boring" "Can't wait to get out  
 of this dump" were some typical       
 replies.  I was inclined to agree with
 them.  Stewartby is boring, and a     
 dump.  After I had asked the key      
 question, I asked them why they found 
 it boring? Their answers came back:   
 "There's nothing to do" "The smoke is 
 bad, you can hardly breathe".         
 Again, I agreed with them. The only   
 thing to do was wander the streets or 
 go to the parks. As for the smoke,    
 sometimes it smells so terrible and is
 so thick that you feel better inside  
 the house.                            
 I went on to ask what they would like 
 to be done to Stewartby. They         
 answered:                             </content>
