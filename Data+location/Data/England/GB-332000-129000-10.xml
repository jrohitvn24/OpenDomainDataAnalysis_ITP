		<content> On Burrow Mump there used to be a     
 fort.The fort was there to defend     
 Athelney Abbey. It was a good place to
 build a fort as you can see for miles 
 around when you stand on top of the   
 Mump. People think that the Romans may
 have been there because Roman coins   
 have been found in the churchyard. The
 fortress was pulled down in the 15th  
 century and a chapel was built. In the
 Civil War some of the King's men      
 sheltered there and the chapel was    
 damaged when they were driven out.    
 In 1750 they decided to rebuild the   
 chapel but it was never quite         
 finished.                             
 The Mump now belongs to the National  
 Trust. There is a small car park at   
 the side and a stile to climb.        
 Although it is a small hill it is     
 quite steep to climb.
