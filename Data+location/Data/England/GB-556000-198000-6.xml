		<title>06THE DODDINGHURST FESTIVAL</title>
		<content> Most local groups hold regular fund-  
 raising events. The Olympic Football  
 Club runs an annual{Donkey Derby}and  
 the school P.A. has a barn dance and  
 Disco. The school provides two musical
 entertainments a year. There are two  
 drama groups "Minstrels" and "D.A.D.S"
 which perform regularly.              
 15 years ago the various groups       
 rationalised their fund raising       
 activities and started the biannual   
{Doddinghurst Festival}which lasts for 
 nine days and includes displays,      
 (this year with work done by          
 children as part of the Domesday      
 Project), social events, several      
 concerts and which culminates in a    
 Family Fun Day, with decorated floats 
 and a fair on the Parish Field.       
 Afterwards the proceeds are           
 distributed between the contributing  
 organisations.                        </content>
