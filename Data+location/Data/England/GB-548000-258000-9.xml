		<content> A typical family.                     
 My name is Alan Hudson and I am eleven
 years old. I have a brother, Mark,    
 aged nine years. We live with my Mum  
 and Dad in our own house.             
 My house has eight rooms, kitchen,    
 front room, living room downstairs and
 three bedrooms, toilet and bathroom   
 upstairs.  We have three television   
 sets, one in the living room, one in  
 the front room and I have one in my   
 bedroom.  There is suitable furniture 
 in each room.                         
 We have a nice garden with a pond in  
 it (with frogs), a greenhouse with    
 lots of plants. We have a lawn with   
 flower beds round it, and at the      
 bottom of the garden we have a shed in
 which we keep tools and odd things.
