  THURSDAY- The Farewell Evening began 
at 8.00pm and about 70 staff(present   
and past),parents,governors,trustees,  
County staff and friends of Goring     
Heath School gathered in the school for
an excellent buffet and punch cup.     
  The headmaster and his wife were     
presented with a slide projector and   
screen,a crystal decanter,bouquet of   
flowers,card and a framed picture of   
the school and chapel from the parents 
and friends. The last item came from   
ex-pupils in the Photographic Club of  
the Secondary School(Langtree). The    
evening was a very happy occasion      
tinged with sadness about the school   
closing.                               
  The Henley Standard reporter(local   
newspaper) was present to photograph   
and record the event. He also inter-   
viewed a former pupil of 1919(page 7). </content>
