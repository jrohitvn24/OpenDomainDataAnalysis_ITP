		<title>15A DAY IN A FARMER'S LIFE.</title>
		<content>   I am a dairy farmer.My day begins at
 about 5.00 a.m. each morning.I get up,
 have a drink of coffee,then I go to   
 milk the cows.In the winter the cows  
 are kept inside,but in the summertime 
 they are in the fields so they have to
 be brought in.Milking takes about two 
 hours.After milking I go to have my   
 breakfast,between 8.30 and 9.00 a.m.  
   In winter, the rest of the morning  
 is spent feeding the cows and young   
 stock,as well as cleaning out.In the  
 summer the morning will be spent doing
 general farm work or harvesting.      
   Afternoon milking begins at around  
 3.00 p.m.                             
   During the winter my day finishes at
 about 6.30 p.m.- but there is some    
 office work to do.In the summer, work 
 often goes on until dusk.Then I try to
 keep one afternoon per week free for  
 office work.                          </content>
