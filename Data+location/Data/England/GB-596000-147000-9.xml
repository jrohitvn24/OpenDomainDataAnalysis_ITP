		<content> Housing is varied, with the oldest    
 house dating from the sixteenth       
 century to small developments of new  
 private housing.Many council houses   
 are being bought by tenants;there are 
 on average twice as many home owners  
 as tenants.Houses are kept in good    
 order with many people 'do-it-yourself
 enthusiasts,often building extensions 
 rather than moving.Loft and wall      
 insulation &amp; double glazing are       
 common.Village centres only tend to be
 on main drainage.                     
{Energy.}Most houses are centrally     
 heated using oil,wood,coal,bottled gas
 &amp; electricity.A few have solar        
 heating.The gas mains to Ashford pass 
 on the west side of the A20.but to    
 which neither village has been        
 connected.
