		<title>08Interview with a Paratrooper</title>
		<content>  On May 16th 1985 we went to Picton   
 Barracks to interview a paratrooper   
 named Private Jones.He has been in the
 1st Battalion Parachute Regiment for  
 three and a half years. He expects his
 posting at Bulford to last four years,
 but he spends four to five months away
 on exercise every year.               
  When the Regiment is in camp the     
 working day is from 8am until 5pm,but 
 on exercise the men are on permanent  
 alert. Time in camp is spent          
 repainting and refurbishing equipment 
 and doing drill.                      
  Private Jones joined the Army because
 he found civilian life boring. His    
 original training was very hard and   
 lasted for six months.He now makes    
 four or five  drops a year from       
 balloons,helicopters and aeroplanes.  
 He must be very fit, so he runs for an
 hour a day to maintain fitness.       </content>
