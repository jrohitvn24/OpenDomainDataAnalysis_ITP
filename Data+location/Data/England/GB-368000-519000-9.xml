 big and if you are at High Cross you  
 can't miss them.Just through the gates
 on your left hand side there is a     
 carpark ,picnic area and a Tarzan     
 Trail.A bit further up there is a path
 that you can walk down and look at the
 different kinds of animals,like foxes,
 sheep,bulls,chipmunks and owls.The    
 Castle specialises in keeping rare    
 breeds of poultry.Under the keep there
 is a souvenir shop which used to be a 
 dungeon.          Lee Gasgarth        </content>
