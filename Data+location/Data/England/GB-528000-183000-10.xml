		<title>10Religion In A Camden School1</title>
		<content> In our school there are children of   
many different nationalities and       
religions. The majority of children in 
our school are Muslims, then Cristions 
with a few Jews and Hindus. A large    
number of children say they have no    
religion. Every day we have an         
assembly, with stories from various    
religions or stories with a moral. Some
times a class talkes about the work    
they have been doing. We did an        
assembly on the Domesday Project. We   
made a song to go with it.             
 Three of our class write about their  
religion. Gayatri is a hindu. "My name 
means G-D. We go to temple every week  
and give our G-D's food. We have many  
G-D's. This time we gave food to Ram.  
We pray at home too. Our special       
festival is Divali which celebrates the
home coming of the Ram. We give        
presents and have parties."            </content>
