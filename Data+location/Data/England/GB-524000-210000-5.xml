		<content>  Our favourite thing at school is the 
 games lesson.Jamie,Stuart,James,Ingrid
 Colette,Tina,Marie and Elaine.        
  Tina enjoys English best of          
 all,although she is good at Maths.    
  Most of the children enjoy writing   
 stories,some like adventures,some love
 stories and some enjoy poems.         
  Ingrid,Elaine,Jamie and Peter are    
 very good at Maths.Marie,Jane,Colette 
 and Elaine are excellent at creative  
 writing.                              
  About fifty percent of the children  
 enjoy drawing and colouring,although  
 some think that they are rather bad at
 it.                                   
  The music that we do includes playing
 the recorder and we all enjoy         
 singing.We sing together in an        
 operetta once a year.This year it was 
 about the {Domesday Survey 1086.
