		<title>01Horton in Ribblesdale</title>
		<content> The village of Horton in Ribblesdale  
 is dominated on the East by the hill  
 of Penyghent, rising above the        
 limestone outcrops and moorland dotted
 with sheep.  Beef cattle and sheep    
 graze in the small fields surrounded  
 by dry-stone walls in the valley      
 bottom.  To the West, the hillside has
 been blasted away by the quarry       
 presenting a huge limestone cliff     
 face.  The Norman church, the inn and 
 the station are the focal points of   
 this scattered community, with        
 outlying hamlets and farms.  Alongside
 the River Ribble runs the             
 Settle-Carlisle railway line, now     
 under threat of closure.  Many        
 visitors come to this village walking 
 the 'Three Peaks' and the Pennine Way.
  They will appreciate the rugged      
 scenery but not understand the        
 problems of life in this remote area. </content>
