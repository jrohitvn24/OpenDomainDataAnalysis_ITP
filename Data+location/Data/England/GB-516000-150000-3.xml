 visited 2 of them.The first 'Chapel   
 Farm'was of 200 acres-all grassland   
 for feeding cows and a few sheep.They 
 also have{educational farm visits}from
 schools and clubs.{Milk production}has
 had to be cut this year because the   
 Common Market does not want as much.  
     The second farm'Boxhill Farm'is   
 about the same size and all{grassland.
