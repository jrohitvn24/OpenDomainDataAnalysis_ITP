		<title>16SCHOOL IN SHEFFIELD</title>
		<content>   I go to{Westways Middle School}which
 is in an area of{Sheffield}called     
{Crookes.}In our school there are 8    
 classes and the children are 8-12     
 years old. There is also a lower      
 school{(Westways First School)}where  
 the children start at 4 years old.    
   I like school and I like doing the  
 work that the teachers set out for us.
 There are 25 children in my class and 
 we sit at desks made to hold 2        
 children. The desks have inkwells     
 which we don't use because we write   
 with pencils. Our teacher sets the    
 desks out in tables of about 8        
 children. I don't like the way that   
 the desks are set out, I'd like them  
 to be in twos. The chairs are hard    
 plastic and they hurt your bottom. The
 old chairs were wooden - they were    
 even worse!
