		<title>10BONE FARM ,PENZANCE .</title>
		<content>  In July we went on a school trip in  
 six cars to Bone Farm.We went into a  
 big field of barley.It was golden     
 brown and waving in the wind.It was up
 to our waists and was going to be cut 
 in two weeks time.We went into a      
 cool,damp wood,with lots of Foxgloves 
 and Deadly Nightshade.There were young
 Willows growing.The twigs could bend  
 without breaking.Some people use them 
 for making crab-pots.We enjoyed going 
 through the potato fields.            
  The potatoes were soon to be         
 harvested and made into crisps.The 150
 sheep were Mules and Devon Longwool.  
  The farmhouse had a huge,old,granite 
 log fireplace.From under the big oak  
 tree we could see St.Michael's Mount  
 and Mount's Bay.                Les.
