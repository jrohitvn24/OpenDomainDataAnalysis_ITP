		<title>02MOUNT CABURN</title>
		<content>{Mount Caburn}is a huge hill about 500 
 feet high. From the top you can look  
 out over the {Sussex Weald,} along    
 the South Downs and the Ouse valley to
 Newhaven and the sea. There is a seat 
 at the top to rest and enjoy the      
 view. Mount Caburn has two ditches    
 right the way round which used  to    
 help protect the{Iron-age }people from
 the{Romans}and other enemies. Mount   
 Caburn has holes where people  were   
 buried. The holes are called {barrows.
  People have dug up these barrows to  
 find signs of{Iron-age} skeletons and 
 urns or pots. Caburn is an ancient    
 hill and has legends about the devil  
 and giants being imprisoned there.    
 There are small craters made by bombs 
 from the second world war. Now it is  
 covered in grass and nettles and wild 
 flowers.
