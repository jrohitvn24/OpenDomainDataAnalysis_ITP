		<title>12Commuting</title>
		<content>Commuting to London is very convenient 
to the population of Sevenoaks because 
it is only 21 miles away and on the    
fast train it is only {32 minutes to   
Charing Cross station.}  The first     
train to London departs Sevenoaks at   
5.11am.  The reason Sevenoaks is so    
popular for commuting is because it is 
fairly rural but near the capital. The 
tickets cost 5.40 return for an adult. 
We found 33% of children in our school 
had parents who worked in London.      
The national average price of houses   
is 36,000pounds and the average price  
of a house in Sevenoaks is about 70,000
pounds.  Houses in Sevenoaks are dearer
because it is one of the best places   
for commuting to London.               
House prices in Sevenoaks have gone up 
10% in the last year, 100% in five     
years and 300% in eight years.
