		<title>01SETTLE AND GIGGLESWICK</title>
		<content> The town of {Settle}and the village of
{Giggleswick}are in the middle of the  
 12 kilometre block. Both places       
 appeared in the original Domesday     
 Book. Most of the buildings date from 
 the 17th.C. although much{new housing 
 has been put up in the last 30 years. 
 This is traditionally a{farming}area  
 now wholly concerned with growing     
 grass for sheep,dairy and beef cattle.
   Settle has become an important      
 centre for the area providing for the 
 needs of local people, and for those  
 of the{visitors}who come into the area
 to enjoy the scenery.The{market}in    
 Settle provides a local focus and an  
 income for the town.                  
   The present threat to close the     
{Settle and Carlisle railway}has       
 brought about much interest both      
 nationally and internationally.
