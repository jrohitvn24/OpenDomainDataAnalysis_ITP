		<title>16A DAY IN THE LIFE OF ANNA</title>
		<content> I get up about quarter to seven get   
 dressed and have my breakfast of rice 
 crispies or coco pops and toast. After
 I watch television or play the piano. 
 Then I start walking to school with my
 Mom. When I get to school I usually   
 put the computer on with Jane. Then we
 do maths, then we have play. After we 
 go on with maths or do copy writing.  
 At 12 o'clock we have our sandwiches  
 and we play until 1 o'clock, then we  
 go swimming. After we do drawing in   
 our book or poetry. Then we have a    
 story and then go home.               
 When I get home I get changed and then
 play on roller boots with Jill and    
 Jane until 5 o'clock when I have tea. 
 After I get ready for Brownies. I am  
 in the Elves Six and at Brownies we do
 lots of things. We play games and make
 things. Then at a quarter past seven  
 we go home.                           </content>
