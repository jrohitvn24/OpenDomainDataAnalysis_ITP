		<title>01Newcomers to Lower Beeding</title>
		<content> Mrs Conley moved to Lower Beeding in  
 March  1985 from Crawley.She wanted   
 to move here because she wanted a     
 bigger garden and because she liked   
 the country side.The people she has   
 met so far are very nice. Mrs Conley  
 has three children,Deborah aged       
 11,Claire aged 8 and Neil aged 5.Her  
 husband owns a travel business but    
 does not work locally.Mrs Conley      
 does not work.Mrs Conley only does    
 some shopping in Lower Beeding.For    
 her there are enough shops and they   
 do sell enough.Mrs Conley only goes   
 to the shops if she forgets           
 something.The two older children go   
 to school in Crawley.Mrs Conley       
 found it difficult to get to know     
 people in the village.She thought an  
 imformation leaflet about             
 organisations in Lower Beeding would  
 have been useful.h                    </content>
