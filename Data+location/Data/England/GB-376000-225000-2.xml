		<content>   Of the latter slightly over half are
 not country bred.                     
   There is an almost even division    
 between those working locally and     
 those who travel to work for distances
 varying from between 5 and 12 miles.  
 Local occupations listed in addition  
 to farming,shop_keeping &amp; garage work 
 included teaching,nursing,vetinary    
 work,ownership of a public/guest house
 ,engineering,social work physiotherapy
 ,insurance and parcel delivery.       
   29 out of the 33 own the properties 
 in which they live. 13 have lived in  
 their present home for 20 years or    
 more (one family for 300 years), while
 16 have moved in within the last 10   
 years. According to a County          
 Councillor there is a considerable    
 turnover of households as folk 'try'  
 country life,find difficulties like   
 the cost of travel and move away.     </content>
