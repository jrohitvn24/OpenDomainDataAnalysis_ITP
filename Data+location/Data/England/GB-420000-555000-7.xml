		<title>07THE TANFIELD RAILWAY</title>
		<content>  All that is left of the{TANFIELD     
{RAILWAY }is the line between Marley   
 Hill Engine Shed and Sunniside.A few  
 local amateurs began the enormous task
 of preserving the railway in 1971.    
  Originally built in 1725,this railway
 superceded the shorter Ravensworth    
 waggonway which was built in the early
 seventeenth century.                  
  The Railway was used for moving coal 
 to the River Tyne.The track was eight 
 miles long between Dunston on Tyne and
 South Moor.At first the waggons were  
 pulled by horses.Some horses were     
 replaced in 1839 by stationary steam  
 engines.By 1881 all horses were       
 replaced and locomotives introduced.  
        The Tanfield Railway ceased to 
 operate between Tanfield and Sunniside
 in 1962 and between Watergate and     
 Whickham in 1964.The last section     
 closed in 1980.                       </content>
