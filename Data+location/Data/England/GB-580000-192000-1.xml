		<content>        Our area has a lot of uneven   
 land the highest point is at the      
 bottom edge which is 68 metres        
 high.There is a lot more farmland than
 built up areas.There are a lot of     
 nurserys doted around,its probably    
 beacause of the amount of grass and   
 farm land. There is a railway track   
 running through the middle of Hockley.
 There is a station just outside of our
 area. There are a lot of wooded       
 areas, the largest wood is the Great  
 Bull Wood. Hockley is very high       
 compared with Hullbridge. We have a   
 rifle range and a country club called 
 the Dome and one police station.      
 There is one primary school and one   
 secondary school in our area. Hockley 
 and Hullbridge both have alot of      
 houses and their own shopping areas   
 although these are quite small.
