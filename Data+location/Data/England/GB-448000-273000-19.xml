		<title>19RUGBY CATTLE MARKET.</title>
		<content> By a charter of 1255 a market for the 
 sale of general commodities and cattle
 was established in certain streets in 
 the town,the market rights being held 
 by the Lord of the Manor.             
 The centre of the town was closed and 
 the accumulated filth in the streets  
 took a week to remove.                
 In 1878 on a site near the Midland    
 Station,a new market opened covering  
 approximately 8 acres of land.In 1880 
 the Railway Company extended their    
 cattle sidings and sold social cheap  
 tickets for the Rugby markets.        
 The market has continued to grow and  
 has become one of the largest in the  
 midlands.Improvements have been       
 made.Held on Mondays,although it's one
 of the largest markets,stock is       
 brought in and sent away quickly.All  
 animals and other goods have been     
 transported by road for some time now.</content>
