		<title>01DESCRIPTION OF THE AREA</title>
		<content>   Bishops Waltham owes its existence  
 to its ideal situation sited as it is 
 in an area abounding in fresh water   
 streams and ponds. Evidence of human  
 occupation as early as 1200 BC has    
 been found and its proximity to{Roman 
 settlements both at Winchester and    
 Portchester made it a natural site for
 the 'Manor of Waltham' and its nearby 
 town which was destroyed in 1001 by   
 the{Danes.                            
   By the time of the first{Domesday   
{Survey in 1086}the Palace was occupied
 by the Bishops of Winchester.         
   The remains of the Palace, built by 
 Benry de Blois at about the same time 
 as his{Hospital of St Cross}south of  
 Winchester, are still outstanding and 
 attractive features seen by all who   
 pass through on the A333, a trunkroad 
 which is now much quieter since the   
 building of the{M27.                  </content>
