		<content> When you live in the country you have 
 to travel quite a long way to get to a
 superstore or supermarket. Our nearest
 small supermarkets are at             
 Winchombe,Bourton on the Water or Stow
 on the Wold all of which are about    
 seven miles away. Most people prefer  
 to travel to these shops for most of  
 their shopping and only occasionally  
 use the local shop (which isn't in our
 block) for things which they have run 
 out of.                               
 We do have daily newspapers,3 times   
 weekly deliveries of milk and vans    
 delivering coal,bread, meat and fish. 
 We have to travel 15 miles to         
 Cheltenham to buy clothes and         
 furniture and so a car is an essential
 living in the country.
