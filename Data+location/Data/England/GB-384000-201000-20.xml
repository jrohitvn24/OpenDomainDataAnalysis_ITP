		<content> Brimscombe Church was completed in    
 1839.It was paid for by the RICARDO   
 FAMILY of Gatcombe Park               
 Minchinhampton,now the home of HRH    
 Princess Anne.It is unusual because   
 the chancel and altar are at the west 
 end.The design is a copy of Norman    
 architecture.                         
 The clock first struck midnight on 1st
 January 1900.The church roof was      
 struck by lightning in 1952 and caught
 fire causing much damage.The church   
 needs to be able to serve people today
 and to be attractive so younger people
 will feel welcome.A kitchen has been  
 built so that people can stay after   
 services for coffee and a chat.       
 The vicar is REV.DAVID GREEN.M.A.     
 There is a METHODIST CHAPEL in        
 Brimscombe which is much older.At one 
 time services were held in a woollen  
 mill.                                 </content>
