		<title>02COASTAL PATH - BIOLOGY</title>
		<content> A survey of the biology of the coastal
 path between the Southern edge of the 
 block and Polurrian Cove was          
 undertaken in July.It was obvious that
 seeds of cultivated plants had escaped
 from gardens and plants became        
 established along the coastal path.   
 North of Polurrian Cove and South of  
 the next cove to the North,Poldhu, the
 path is bounded on the landward side  
 by a stone wall and this offers       
 another niche for coastal plants to   
 colonise besides the cliff tops.      
{A list of plants and animals          
{identified along the path is shown on 
{the next page. }
