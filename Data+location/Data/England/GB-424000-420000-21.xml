<title>21Shopping in Dewsbury 2011</title>
<content>Sadly, the statement about Dewsbury in 1986 could be about 2011. Parking in Dewsbury remains a problem, in the sense that you either have to pay or sneak into a carpark of a shop, e.g. matalan or Sainsbury's. Many shops remain empty and businesses have to close, most notably, the old Pioneer building has been bought by a developer a few years ago and then been left empty and undeveloped! This is one of the beautiful Victorian buildings in the town which have been left abandoned. The market, however, continues to be really popular and people come from far and wide to shop at it.&lt;br />
