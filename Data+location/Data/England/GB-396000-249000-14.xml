		<title>14FOOD AND EATING HABITS.</title>
		<content>   A random survey of eating habits    
 revealed the following information.   
   For the vast majority of people     
 breakfast consists of a bowl of cereal
 or toast and a drink of tea, coffee or
 fruit juice. Very few people also have
 some form of cooked protein (sausage, 
 bacon, egg). Most people have a       
 mid-morning drink of tea or coffee.   
   At lunch time everyone has a        
 sandwich or snack, with few exceptions
 who had nothing .(NB. these were not  
 those who had had a cooked breakfast) 
   Everyone had a cooked evening meal  
 comprising of some protein usually    
 meat, potatoes and vegetables often   
 followed by a sweet or pudding. Some  
 people had tea, coffee, a soft or     
 alcoholic drink later in the evening. 
 Everyone seemed to eat the day's main 
 meal at the table although other meals
 were often eaten in the kitchen.      </content>
