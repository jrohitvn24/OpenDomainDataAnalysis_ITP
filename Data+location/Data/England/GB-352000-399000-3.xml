		<title>03GARSWOOD RAILWAY STATION</title>
		<content>  Garswood Station was built in the    
 1840's. In those days the trains used 
 to carry coal but nowadays they carry 
 people.The station hasn't changed a   
 lot over the years. It is very quiet  
 and old fashioned. There are four     
 people who work at the station,two    
 relief workers and two station        
 masters. They collect or sell tickets,
 clean the station and help people on  
 and off the trains.The trains run to  
 Liverpool or Wigan.The relief workers 
 think it the nicest station in the    
 area.There is a little vandalism in   
 the station and someone commited      
 suicide near the station.Forty four   
 trains come in one day and three      
 hundredand eight in a week,which makes
 about 16060 a year.All the workers    
 wear a special uniform,which has just 
 been issued. There are two waiting    
 rooms.                                </content>
