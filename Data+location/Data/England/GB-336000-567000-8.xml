		<title>08CONSERVATION OF FISH.</title>
		<content> The priority task of a Water Bailiff  
 managing the stretch of the Border Esk
 which flows through Longtown is the   
 conservation and protection of fish as
 defined in the Fisheries Protection   
 Act 1975.With the Esk flowing into the
 Solway Estuary the jurisdiction of the
 river is under the control of the     
 North West Water Authority.Other      
 duties involve the restocking of the  
 river with brown trout and salmon     
 fry,and also constantly monitoring the
 discharge of effluent into drainage   
 systems which eventually flow into the
 Esk.Combatting poaching is becoming an
 increasingly important task,as with   
 the escalating cost of salmon and sea 
 trout,illegal netting and poisoning   
 of fish is on the increase.A bailiff  
 is also required to assist chemists   
 and biologists in the regular         
 collection of water-samples and fish. </content>
