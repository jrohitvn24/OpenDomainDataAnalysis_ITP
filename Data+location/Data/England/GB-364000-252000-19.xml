		<title>19TRANSPORT AROUND BROMYARD</title>
		<content>    Before 1964, Bromyard had a{railway
 which provided a useful service for   
 the public and helped to distribute   
 industrial products, such as flooring 
 tiles from the Stream Hall{Brick and  
{Tile Works.}Now, only a few remaining 
 tracks can be seen near{Holden        
{Hydroman's factory}on the{new         
{industrial estate.                    
    In 1985 the{main public transport  
 is by bus. In a rural community, bus  
 services are necessary. The main bus  
 services are{Midland Red, Jones and   
{Morris.}In June 1967, the{by-pass}was 
 built to help relieve the congestion  
 of traffic in the{narrow streets.     
    Children who live outside Bromyard 
 are taken to school by coach although 
 most families own cars. During severe 
 weather pupils from outlying farms are
 unable to attend school. Broad Bridge 
 is the site of the local coach depot. </content>
