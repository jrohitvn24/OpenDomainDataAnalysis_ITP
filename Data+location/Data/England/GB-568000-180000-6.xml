		<title>06FARMING AROUND STANFORD</title>
		<content>   The belt of land between Stanford   
 and the refineries is occupied by 2   
 farms, Old Hall Farm and Oak Farm.    
 Their activities are strongly         
 influenced by the nature of the land. 
   Close to the river is marshland,    
 waterlogged during winter. At a       
 slightly higher elevation is the      
 'topland', Grade 2 Agricultural land, 
 overlying gravel and clay.            
   Old Hall Farm uses its large area of
 marshland as summer pasture for Beef  
 cattle, growing crops such as wheat   
 and barley on the more easily         
 cultivated 'topland'.The cattle are   
 stall-fed in winter.                  
   Oak Farm, with no marshland is      
 totally arable.Out of an area of 250  
 acres, the farmer grows about 160     
 acres of wheat and barley, 70 acres of
 assorted vegetables and 20 acres of   
 potatoes.                             </content>
