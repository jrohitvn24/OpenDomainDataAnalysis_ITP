		<title>13Peculiarities of the River</title>
		<content> We believe it is one of only two      
 rivers in the world which has a       
 "bore":an advancing wall of water     
 which heads the up-tide,upstream of   
 which the level of the river is       
 significantly lower than that of the  
 tidal flow.Depending on the wind      
 direction and strength and the        
 equinoctial state of the tides,the    
 bore travels at 10mph and as it       
 passes it instantly converts the river
 from half-empty to brim-full.As the   
 leading edge of the bore approaches,  
 its edges slapping the banks,it sounds
 like an express train rushing round   
 the corners into the watcher's reach. 
 As it goes by,whirlpools and eddies   
 form and reform and the continuing    
 tidal flow quickly but almost         
 imperceptibly raises the level even   
 more so that within an hour or so the 
 full depth for that tide is reached.  </content>
