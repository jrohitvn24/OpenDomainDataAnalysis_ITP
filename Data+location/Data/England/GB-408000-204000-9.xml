		<title>09ARLINGTON ROW, BIBURY</title>
		<content> Arlington Row was built as a wool barn
 but converted into weavers cottages in
 the 17th century. They are now owned  
 by the National Trust and were        
 restored in 1929. There were          
 originally ten houses but now there   
 are only eight.                       
 About half the residents were born    
 locally, two of them in  Arlington    
 Row. They enjoy living in the Row but 
 suffer a lack of privacy due to many  
 visitors to a famous row of houses.   
 One resident's family has lived in    
 Arlington Row since 1890. She left    
 after getting married but returned    
 later. She does not like it as much   
 now as in the old days. There are more
 holiday, weekend and retired people   
 and not so many workers. She misses   
 the community life and the closeness  
 of the village people.
