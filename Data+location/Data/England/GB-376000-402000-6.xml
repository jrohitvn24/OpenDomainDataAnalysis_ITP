		<title>06Shopping in Pendlebury</title>
		<content>     In{Pendlebury}we have lots of     
{shops}and a{market.}The market is open
 three times a week and my mum goes    
 there to buy lots of food. I go with  
 her on Saturdays to carry the         
 shopping. When you go in it smells of 
{fish and cabbage.}I don't like that so
 I hurry past those stalls. Where the  
{barbecued chickens}are cooking it     
 smells lovely and makes my mouth      
 water. Most people shop in the market 
 because it is very cheap. You can buy 
 any type of{food, clothes, sports     
{clothes, toys and material.}I asked   
 people if they did all their shopping 
 in the market. Most people said that  
 they went to the{supermarket}to buy   
{bread, frozen food}and special food   
 like{pizzas}and{herbs.                
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
