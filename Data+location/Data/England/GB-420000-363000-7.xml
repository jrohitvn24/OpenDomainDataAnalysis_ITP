		<content> A quarter of the working population of
 Youlgrave work in the village.        
 Employment is available in the shops, 
 pubs, school, at the sock factory and 
 on the farms. Just outside the village
 is the refractory at Friden and the   
 limestone quarry at Hawley's Bridge.  
 Of those people who work outside the  
 village 40% work within 5 miles of    
 Youlgrave whilst 20% work over 20     
 miles away.                           
 Most people in full-time employment do
 "skilled" work (58%) with a smaller   
 number being "unskilled" (16%),       
 "managerial" (14%) or "professional"  
 (12%).                                
 A large number of people, mainly      
 women, have part-time employment. Many
 of these do "unskilled" work, often   
 involving cleaning or domestic help.
