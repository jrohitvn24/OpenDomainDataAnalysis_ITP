 During the past 50 years the number of
 working farms of about l5 in l926 has 
 fallen to 6 in l985.  Much original   
 farm land has been taken over for use 
 as caravan and camping parks.  These  
 farms mix cultivation of barley and   
 wheat and root vegetables with sheep  
 and cattle grazing.Until recently one 
 farm grew wheat especially for thatch 
 for some of the listed buildings in   
 the area.                             
                                       
 A recent innovation on one farm has   
 been the cultivation of strawberries.
