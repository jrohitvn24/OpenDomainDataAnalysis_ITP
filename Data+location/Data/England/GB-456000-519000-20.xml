		<title>20TOURISM</title>
		<content> Although the area is largely rural    
 the presence of the I.C.I. complex and
 the resultant pollution means that    
 tourism is on a small scale and       
 limited to the village of Kirkleatham.
 In Kirkleatham tourism is in its      
 infancy although there are plans just 
 begun for major development.They plan 
 to build a park,an aviary and a large 
 greenhouse.The people have different  
 opinions to the local council.The     
 council wish to develop Kirkleatham   
 into a tourist attraction but the     
 people who live nearby think its too  
 much of an industrial area and the    
 moors and sea-side aren't very far    
 away.{LOCAL HISTORY:}Kirkleatham      
 museum concentrates on the rural and  
 social developments of the past 400   
 years.The Almshouses opened in 1676   
 bear the name of Sir William Turner   
 the Benefactor.                       </content>
