		<title>01South west Longmynd, Shrops</title>
		<content> The bracken and heather covered top of
 the Longmynd is a wild desolate area. 
 The Portway, an ancient pack horse    
 route follows the ridge. Streams      
 emerge from the peaty springs and flow
 away down the steep sided valleys,    
 called hollowsand batches, like Ashes 
 Hollow. The area, popular in summer   
 with walkers and picnickers, provides 
 interest for ornithologists and stream
 dipping students. Near the southern   
 end of the Longmynd is one of the     
 first gliding airfields, established  
 in 1934 by the Midland Gliding Club   
 which today is among the country's    
 largest clubs. Facilities include     
 residential clubhouse, workshops and  
 hangar for its glider fleet. The club 
 operates some 300 days a year provi-  
 ding glider launching by aeroplane,   
 winch or traditional catapult &amp; flying
 training for its 250 members.         </content>
