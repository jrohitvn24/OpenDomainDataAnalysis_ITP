		<title>14Houses in Haltwhistle</title>
		<content>   The oldest houses in Haltwhistle are
 around the Market Square and Castle   
 Hill.  They are built of local stone  
 and most are privately owned.  At the 
 west end of town there are a lot of   
 terraced houses, both stone and brick 
 built.  Bricks used to be made locally
 at Bardon Mill until the supply of    
 local clay was used up.               
   The Council have  just completed a  
 new estate which is surrounded by     
 shrubs and trees.  Older council      
 houses nearer the centre of town are  
 being renovated.  There are some two  
 and three storey blocks of flats.     
   Old people throughout the district  
 retire to sheltered accommodation in  
 the town.  There are two homes for    
 elderly people but many choose to live
 in one of the flats or bungalows which
 have resident wardens to help them.   
   There are about 2000 houses in all. </content>
