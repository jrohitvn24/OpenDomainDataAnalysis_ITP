		<content> The rooms sometimes have a ceiling    
 rose which is a circle of patterned   
 plaster going around the light.  They 
 also have a cornice which goes around 
 the top of the ceiling and has the    
 same pattern as the ceiling rose.  In 
 every room the houses have fireplaces 
 even in the bedrooms.  Above the      
 fireplaces there is usually a         
 mantlepiece made of marble and it can 
 hold quite a lot.  Sometimes the      
 fireplaces are tiled.  The bathroom is
 usually not that big.  The houses have
 quite big kitchens and the kitchen    
 range would now have been replaced by 
 a gas or electric cooker.  The houses 
 have cellars for the coal.  They are  
 usually 2 or 3 storeys high and have  
 lots of chimneys.
