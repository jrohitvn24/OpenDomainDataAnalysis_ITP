		<title>10THE WAY OF LIFE  NASH AREA</title>
		<content> Although major items must be bought   
 outside, services to the villages are 
 necessary to the communities. Nash    
 Village Shop and Post Office stocks   
 most essentials. This store has been  
 run, since the 1890's until recently  
 by the Harris family.                 
 Mobile services include the library   
 van, fishmonger, greengrocer, butcher 
 and baker. Milk is delivered daily.   
 The local public houses are meeting   
 places for some, The Bell in          
 Beachampton and the Old English       
 Gentleman in Nash offer meals and     
 outdoor facilities where children can 
 play. Darts matches are also arranged.
 Young people show an interest in pop  
 music, fashion and hair and beauty    
 products, but must travel to find     
 organised events. A weekly bus service
 to Milton Keynes illustrates the need 
 for independent transport.            </content>
