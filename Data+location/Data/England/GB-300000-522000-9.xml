		<title>09DAIRY FARMING</title>
		<content> Hayecasle Farm has 250 cattle         
 altogether,80 milking cows and 170    
 beef cattle.The milkers are Friesians,
 the rest are Charolais and Limousin.  
 The 30 calves are a mixture.The farmer
 gets 320 gallons of milk a day;his    
 best cow yields 7 gallons a day.After 
 about 8 years the cows are sold or    
 sooner if their milk dries up.        
  The cows are milked twice a day,once 
 at 6am and again at 4pm.They are given
 cow cake while they are milked.The    
 milk is sent to the Milk Marketing    
 Board to be bottled.                  
  22 acres of barley is grown,mostly to
 feed to the animals.There are two     
 working sheep dogs and a puppy on the 
 farm,4 ponies and a Clydesdale Shire  
 horse.Mr Christopherson made us very  
 welcome at his farm and we learnt     
 alot.
