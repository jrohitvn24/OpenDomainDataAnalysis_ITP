		<content> They said that drug addiction was     
 never heard of fifty years ago and    
 violence was very rare, mugging of old
 people was unheard of.The older people
 blamed television, lack of jobs and   
 modern pressures of life for these    
 types of anti-social activities.Lack  
 of jobs can be partly blamed on pit   
 closures and increased mechanisation  
 on the local farms.A large number of  
 the young unemployed said that they   
 had never had a job and were          
 absolutely bored.Many people were     
 moving away in search of employment   
 sometimes as far as London.Some local 
 people blamed the Government for the  
 unemployment whilst others thought    
 that many would not have work, even   
 if offered.
