		<content>Conflicting views:                     
"An old stately home near Fazeley, now 
given over to amusement arcades, a fun 
fair and a very smelly zoo. It costs   
one pound for adults, 60p for children,
and 30p for cars. None of which is at  
all worth it!"                         
"However, another view is that for     
relatively little expense a family can 
spend a most enjoyable day. Recently a 
6th form pupil from our school         
accompanied her aunt and small cousin  
for a day's outing. Each paid a nominal
fee and were then allowed on most rides
free for the day. The owners of the    
park have been most careful to retain  
the atmosphere."                       
Several sixth formers who work at the  
park estimate "On an average Sunday    
approx 16 000 pounds is taken for rides
alone." (wages,17yr old:95p/hr)
