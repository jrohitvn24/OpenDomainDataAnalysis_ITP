		<title>16Public Houses.</title>
		<content> There are three public houses in      
 Blackmore.At the head of Church Street
 lies the picturesque{Bull Inn}.This   
{inn}dates from 1500 and has ancient   
 beams on display.Local history says   
 that it might have been the brewing   
 house for he Priory.Besides the{trade 
{in}alcoholic and soft drinks,snacks   
 and meals are served inside and in the
 back garden.At certain times the inn  
 has a folk club upstairs{.The Leather 
{Bottle}is situated on Horsefair Green.
 The present premises only date back to
 1954 when the original Inn was        
 destroyed by fire. Like the other pubs
 it serves snacks and meals.{The Prince
{Albert},opposite the post office,was  
 named after Queen Victoria's husband. 
 It has a lot of beams and brasswork   
 and a large collection of key rings   
 pinned to overhead beams.
