		<content>A POSTMAN is the person who delivers   
letters to our house and posts them    
through our letterbox. The process     
begins when we post a letter into a    
post box. A postman comes and collects 
the letters from the box and takes them
to be sorted. Then the postman brings  
the letters to our door.               
A DUSTBINMAN is a person who collects  
the rubbish from our homes, puts it in 
his cart and takes it to a special     
dump with all the other rubbish.       
A POLICEMAN OR WOMAN is someone who    
tries to defend the law by arresting   
people who commit crimes, such as      
theft, violence or murder. Some people 
go to court and then prison; others    
just pay a fine. Police also help the  
community in various ways, such as by  
retrieving lost property.
