  To raise money to build the club     
 house,they organised car boot sales   
 and other similar events,but the

 supplied a bike and they rode in relay
 to Exeter city football club where the
 manager of Exeter city came out to    
 sign their sponser forms.             
  There are nine members of the        
 commitee and approximately two hundred
