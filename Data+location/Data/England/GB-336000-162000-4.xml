		<title>04THE CIDER FARM</title>
		<content> The Langdons cider farm gets its      
 apples from Hereford.  They come in 20
 ton loads and are dumped in the yard. 
 A tractor with a bucket picks up the  
 apples which are put on an elevator.  
 At the same time they are washed, then
 they fall into a mincer where every   
 thing is minced.  Then you take a slat
 with a nylon cloth over it and take   
 off a measured amount.  We do the same
 until we have 15 slats on top of each 
 other.  Then a ram comes up and pushes
 it to the top and all the juice runs  
 into a tank below the floor.  Next it 
 is put into a tank outside and left   
 for three months.  Finally it is sold 
 to the customers who come to the cider
 farm.  We tasted it and it was lovely.
