		<content> For 34 years Hestover Farm has been a 
 dairy and battery unit run by one of  
 the farming families in Baltonsborough
 Altogether they have 4000 hens which  
 are all called Lucy. All of the hens  
 are brown except for one white one.   
 About 1860 eggs are produced each     
 day and they are sold both locally and
 nationally through supermarkets.      
 The eggs are graded according to      
 weight by a mechanical grader.        
 The hens are kept in 2 barns holding  
 2000 poulets or hens in each.         
 Because of the importance of keeping a
 constant temperature in the battery,  
 there is a stand-by generator.
