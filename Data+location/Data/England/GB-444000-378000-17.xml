		<title>17A Local Priest (R.C.)</title>
		<content> A catholic priest came to school today
 and we discovered the following things
 about him.His full name is Father     
 Peter Maguire.He has two churches, the
 Church of the Annunciation in         
 Eckington and the Church of the       
 Imaculate Conception in Spinkhill.He  
 told us that being apriest is a full  
 time job but he does have some hobbies
 mainly reading and sport.In his spare 
 time he does a lot of voluntary work  
 with mothers and young babies.He was  
 24 when he became apriest and he is   
 now 37.He told us that catholic       
 priests don't get married so that they
 can give all of their time to the     
 church.He wears special long clothes  
 when he is taking a service to remind 
 everyone that he is representing      
 Jesus.He was born in Pontefract,went  
 to school in Leeds and trained to be a
 priest in Durham.He was very helpful. </content>
