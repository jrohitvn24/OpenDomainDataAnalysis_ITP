 The existing hedges round the fields  
 are ancient and mixed, most of        
 hawthorn with other species such as   
{sycamore,dogwood}and{holly}which have 
 grown from seedlings over the years.  
 Such hedges are vital habitats for    
 many types of animals and birds, and  
 afford a rich food supply for such    
 fauna in the way of young shoots,nuts 
 and berries.Black berries are gavered 
 regularly by both animals and the     
 people of the village to flavour their
 apples and to make bramble jelly and  
 wines. Many wild flowers grow along   
 the road sides and under the hedges,  
 many of which are listed below.There  
 is a great fear by environmentalists  
 that the countinued use of            
 insecticides and weed killer sprays   
 will cause the loss of much such      
 animals and plants.                   </content>
