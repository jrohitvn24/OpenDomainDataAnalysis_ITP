		<title>12RESIDENTIAL USE OF FARMHOUSE</title>
		<content> Dunton Lodge is in Bedfordshire. The  
 owner farms four hundred acres in     
 Bedfordshire and about a thousand in  
 Standon, Hertfordshire, about 20 miles
 away. The owner is growing oilseed    
 rape which is a new crop to him and a 
 comparatively new one in this country.
 After harvesting the seeds are crushed
 and the oils are extracted and used   
 for making low cholesterol margerine  
 and cooking oil Most farms had        
 paddocks for horses when they were    
 used on the farm. This farmer enjoys  
 riding and keeps two horses in a      
 paddock. They are sometimes joined by 
 two heiffers.The owner of Bluegates   
 keeps horses as well. The             
 Cambridgeshire Hunt can be seen in    
 the area in the late Autumn and Winter
 The Lodge is rented to a plumber.     
  Many farm buildings are useful to    
 both craftsmen and tradesmen.         </content>
