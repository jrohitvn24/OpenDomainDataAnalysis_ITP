		<title>05Brookmans Park Housing</title>
		<content>    All the houses in Brookmans Park   
 are privatly owned.Most of the houses 
 are detached and have their own large 
 gardens.Four or five of the roads are 
 private and most people use them for  
 short cuts to the A1000.The gardens   
 in Brookmans Park are well looked     
 after with many expensive features.   
 Most of the houses were built after   
 the opening of the local railway      
 station.                              
    Most of the houses have been       
 designed differently.Many of them have
 had extensions added but unfortunately
 some of them do not fit in with the   
 original design.
