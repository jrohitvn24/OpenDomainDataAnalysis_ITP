		<title>03LOUGHWOOD BAPTIST CHAPEL</title>
		<content> Loughwood Chapel was built in 1653. It
 is built of stone. The roof is made of
 reed thatch.The pews in the chapel are
 like cubicles with locks on the doors 
 so that the people in them could only 
 see the preacher. There is a pit where
 people were baptised in spring        
 water.There is said to be a secret    
 door behind the pulpit so that the    
 preacher could escape if soldiers     
 came. People in the seventeenth       
 century were persecuted for their     
 beliefs.The chapel was originally     
 surrounded by woodland and people came
 to worship on horse back. There are   
 rings on the stable wall where horses 
 were tethered. A man named Isaac Hann,
 who died on 17th March 1778, is buried
 in the churchyard.                    
   The chapel now belongs to the       
 National Trust and services are still 
 held there.                           </content>
