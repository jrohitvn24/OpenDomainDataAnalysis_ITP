		<title>12The Village,Ayot St.Lawrence</title>
		<content> Ayot St.Lawrence village is surrounded
 by peaceful countryside.It can only be
 be reached by narrow country lanes. In
 Winter the roads easily get blocked by
 snow so the village is secluded. It   
 has a population of about 100         
 people.The majority of houses were    
 built in the 15th-18th centuries.     
 Originally many ofthe older houses    
 were farm-workers' cottages which have
 been extended and modernised. In some 
 cases several adjoining cottages have 
 been converted into one dwelling. Only
 one new house has been built since    
 1950.Most of the gardens cover 1-3    
 acres. Most people choose to live in  
 the area because it is peaceful with  
 beautiful countryside and is near     
 London. The villagers' main dislikes  
 are:no public transport,and the narrow
 winding lanes,which are dangerous when
 visitors flock there.                 </content>
