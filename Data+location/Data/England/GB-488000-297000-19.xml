		<content>    In this pub, which also has a warm,
 appealing atmosphere,there are three  
 rooms for accommodation. Customers    
 come for 'Bed and Breakfast' as well  
 as longer stays. Hot and cold food is 
 served, and the local Ruddles beers   
 plus Marstons ales are served.        
                                       
    The building itself is of          
 historical interest, being built in   
 Tudor times, and still sporting two   
 priest's holes. Walter de la Mare, the
 poet, has apparently carved his name  
 on the stone fireplace, and many other
 names and dates can be seen carved on 
 the walls.
