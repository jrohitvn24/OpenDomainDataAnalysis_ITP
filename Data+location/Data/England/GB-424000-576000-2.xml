		<title>02Cramlington:Introduction</title>
		<content> Cramlington is an area which is       
 changing all the time. There used to  
 be coal mines in many of the places   
 where now there are houses, factories 
 or open spaces. The old spoil heaps   
 have been smoothed out and grassed    
 over.                                 
   Cramlington is popular because of   
 the facilities available. There is a  
 variety of housing, good transport    
 links, open parkland and shopping and 
 recreation centres. The town has cycle
 tracks on which people can travel from
 one estate to another in safety.      
   The town is surrounded by some      
 beautiful countryside including       
 Plessey Woods, which is a Country     
 Park.
