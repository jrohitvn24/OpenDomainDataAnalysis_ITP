		<content> There's lots of noise, the playing of 
 games and some children shouting      
 across to each other. Infants and     
 Juniors run around screaming and      
 shouting. The older boys want to play 
 cricket. They tell Scott to go away   
 and play in the other playground. The 
 Junior girls are playing Dub-Dub-In.  
 Rachael runs from behind the terrapin,
 but Helen whirls round and dubs her   
 out. Some girls play horses, some pick
 daisies and make daisy chains. Other  
 children put the mats out and go on   
 the climbing frame. They all do little
 wheels together. Samantha and Alice   
 walk around looking very bored. In the
 middle of the playground the Infants  
 decide to play Line Tag. They run all 
 over the playground. Alex gets annoyed
 and chases them.Somebody usually falls
 over and it's Stella today. Mr.Sanders
 calls,"In time!" and they all go in.  </content>
