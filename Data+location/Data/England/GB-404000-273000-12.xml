		<title>12FUN AT HORSE SHOWS AND FETES</title>
		<content> On Sun. April 28th I was really       
 excited about the Wythall Horse Show.I
 went up to the stable yard in         
 Houndsfield Lane and groomed my horse 
 "Lady Gem".Then I went to the show    
 and won{3}clear rounds!I won the      
 Chase-Me-Charlie but lost two         
 races.Dad took some photos and I      
 went home happy.We{really}enjoyed the 
 Vicarage Garden Party. We raised Â£500 
 for St. Mary's organ and there were   
 lots of sideshows. I won a teddy      
 bear.Mum bought a lot of cakes and    
 plants.{But}the best fete was the big 
 one on Becketts field for the Maypole 
 Church.We had thirty side shows with  
 Aunt Sallies and Break The Crocks. I  
 won a big coconut and broke lots of   
 cups. Then I went on the huge bouncing
 castle that you could see for miles.  
 We raised over Â£1000 .{Meadow Green
