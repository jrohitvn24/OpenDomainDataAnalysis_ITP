		<content>  We sent out a questionnaire to 500   
 houses in our area.From our           
 questionnaire we found that two-thirds
 of the people who replied had not     
 lived in Pelsall all their lives.One  
 of the reasons for this is that the   
 village of Pelsall has expanded over  
 the last thiry years.                 
    We found that people had moved to  
 the area gradually over this period.  
    We also found that the people who  
 had moved to the area came from very  
 local places such as                  
 Bloxwich,Aldridge,Willenhall,Brownhill
 s and Walsall.Two people had come from
 Australia and one from Scotland but   
 the vast majority came from the local 
 places written above.All the people   
 questioned except one said they liked 
 living in Pelsall.So,we can conclude  
 that Pelsall 1985 is a nice place to  
 live.  {                              </content>
