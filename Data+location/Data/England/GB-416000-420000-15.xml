		<title>15THE EURO M.P.(CONT)</title>
		<content> at the{Liverpool-Juventus match in    
{Brussels in May 1985.}He thinks that  
 the good points of being a Euro M.P   
 are that you can meet different people
 visit other countries .The bad points 
 of being a Euro M.P are being away    
 from home,travelling in winter with   
 fog and snow.Sometimes Mr.Megahy books
 meetings a year in advance.Mr.Megahy  
 hopes politics will be here in the    
 future  and that people will not spend
 alot of money on weapons and try to   
 agree with others.Mr.Megahy hopes that
 they can conquer unemployment and its 
 associated problems.The important     
 thing Mr.Megahy would change about his
 job is that the meeting should be in  
 one place like Brussels.{Mr.Megahy is 
{deputy-leader of the British Labour   
{group in the E.E.C.}He is also seeking
 the nomination from the local Labour  
 party for the next{General Election.  </content>
