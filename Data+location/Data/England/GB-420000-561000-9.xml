		<title>09SLUM CLEARANCE IN ELSWICK</title>
		<content> Most of the area consists of 19th.    
 century terraced houses and post war  
 semi-detached council houses which    
 have fallen into decay and are now    
 being modernised by the council or are
 being bought by{private builders}who  
 are almost rebuilding them and selling
 them to the general public.           
   Large areas were cleared in the     
 1950's{slum clearance}programme and   
 replaced with{multi-storey flats.     
 Within about twenty years the area    
 was in such a bad condition due to    
 poor quality design and construction  
 that the flats were vacated and       
 eventually demolished. A more         
 traditional type of housing           
 development was planned for the area  
 with terraced houses built around     
 green open spaces.This new housing is 
 improving the overall environment of  
 an inner city area.                   </content>
