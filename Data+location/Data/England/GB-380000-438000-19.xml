		<content> The village was quieter in days gone  
 by with less traffic. A Fun Fair came 
 on Good Friday till 1930's with attra-
 ctions big and small. From 1920-40's  
 1000's of hens were kept locally. Many
 owners were ex-mill workers. Chicks   
 bred here were sent all over the world
 ( now few hens are kept). There was a 
 toll on the Barley Road at Whitehough 
 and one into Barley Village itself.   
 This road along with others has since 
 been widened. Many trees were removed 
 as a result. A chapel at Crowtrees was
 taken down 10yrs ago and put into the 
 foundations of the Bullion at Barley. 
 The first bus in the area was an old  
 wagon used in the week to carry coal &amp;
 cleaned up at weekends for passengers.
 Another was known as the Covered Wagon
 There were more buses then. They would
 stop anywhere on route and carried any
 thing-even animals to auction!        </content>
