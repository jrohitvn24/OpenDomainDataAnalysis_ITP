		<content> The area is classified as mainly{Rough
{Grazing}but this would annoy the local
 farmers as it is really carefully     
 managed{Permanent Pasture.            
 On this grassland{sheep and cattle}   
 (mainly Fresian dairy cows and        
 crossbred sheep for breeding or meat) 
 graze in hedged fields.               
{Crops}are mainly turnips,barley and   
 grass to feed stock but potatoes are  
 grown for human consumption.          
 Increasingly, oilseed rape is grown.  
{Market Gardening}used to be important,
 started by the Land Settlement        
 Association but is now virtually      
 ceased. The smallholdings with their  
 characteristic Dutch style houses are 
 now almost all owned by families not  
 engaged in horticulture.              
 Small-scale{Forestry}(mainly hardwood)
 takes advantage of earlier estate     
 plantings.                            </content>
