		<content> The electricity supply from the West  
 Midlands Electricity Board meets most 
 energy needs.  Most lines are overhead
 but there are some underground cables.
  Cooking and heating are either by    
 solid fuel or electricity and         
 occasionally by calor gas.  There is  
 no mains gas supply.  Open fires are  
 still found in many dwellings as the  
 area is not a smokeless zone.  Many   
 farms use irrigation, pumping water   
 from the River Roden up to an amount  
 specified by the Severn Trent Water   
 Board.  Other services available in   
 this area are mains water supply,     
 mains drainage, telephone and post.   
 One smallholding has its own borehole 
 supply of water.  Roads are maintained
 by the Local Authority.
