		<title>02THE M6 AND THELWALL VIADUCT</title>
		<content> The viaduct was built in 1963 and is  
 over 1 mile long. It carries the M6   
 over{The Manchester Ship Canal}and{The
{River Mersey.}At the moment (summer   
 1985) there are traffic problems      
 because of repair work. Long delays   
 occurr at busy times of the day.      
   The viaduct is very tall and can be 
 seen all over the area.               
   The Grandfather of one of our group 
 helped to build the viaduct and his   
 wife was one of the first people to   
 walk across the finished bridge.      
   Underneath the viaduct you can      
 see concrete pillars and many sets of 
 steps going up. It is very noisy.     
   In the future there may be work to  
 make the road wider or even a second  
 bridge to carry the ever increasing   
 traffic using the M6 motorway.
