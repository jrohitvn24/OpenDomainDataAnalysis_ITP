		<title>08Rubery in the early 1900's</title>
		<content> The motor era was just beginning.White
 and Pikes printing works at Longbridge
 closed down and the derelict site was 
 bought by Herbert Austin. The first   
 car took a year to produce and was    
 tested by Austin himself on the Lickey
 Hills in 1906.                        
 Rubery had grown from a few cottages  
 to 146 houses, for apart from the     
 Motor Works there were Quarries,the   
 Asylum, and now two brickworks.       
 There was a mineral water factory     
 owned by Sidney Lander,later taken    
 over by Saxons on the site of the now 
 "Hawthorns Social Club"               
 During the war the Austin Motor Co.   
 made munitions:8 million sheets, 650  
 guns, 2000 aeroplanes, 2,500 aero     
 engines and 2,000 trucks.             
 Rubery Hill Hospital became a military
 hospital ,and most homes took in      
 relatives of the wounded soldiers.    </content>
