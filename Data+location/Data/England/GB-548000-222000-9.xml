		<content> I get up at 7.30am and have a cup of  
 tea.After getting dressed I leave for 
 school with my mum and brother.I start
 school at 8.55. After assembly we     
 work until 10.30am.For 15 minutes we  
 usually play games.After playtime we  
 work until 11.55 when we have lunch.  
 During the afternoon I continue my    
 lessons.If it's sunny we work outside 
 or play games.At 3.15 pm I walk home. 
 When I get home I change into my      
 playing clothes, call for my friends  
 and go to the recreation playground.  
 At about 5pm I go home for something  
 to eat.Usually I watch television.My  
 favourite kind of programmes are      
 cartoons,films and serials.           
 At about 8 pm I get ready for bed and 
 go to my room to read .               
 At weekends I lay in bed until 9 pm.  
 Usually I help my parents with the    
 shopping in the afternoon.            </content>
