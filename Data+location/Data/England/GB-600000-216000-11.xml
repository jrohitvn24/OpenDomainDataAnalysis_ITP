 Someone is chosen to be 'IT'. Then we 
 decide which places are safe. Safe    
 places might include a wall, steps, a 
 fence or a bench. If you are in one of
 these places you cannot be caught. The
 person who is 'IT' has to try and     
 catch another person. If someone is   
 caught, he becomes 'IT'.              
                                       
{ORANGE BALLS                          
 We make a circle. Then we skip round, 
 singing the song Orange balls. At the 
 end of it we sit down and the last    
 person to sit down goes out of the    
 circle. We choose a person that we    
 think they love, and sing a song while
 the first person goes back in the     
 middle. If he or she does love the    
 person we chose, he has to clap and if
 he does not love the person he has to 
 stamp his feet.                       </content>
