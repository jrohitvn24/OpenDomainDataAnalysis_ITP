		<content> The area included in our square is    
 part of the Green Belt around London. 
 This is an area of woodland, farmland 
 and parkland forming a green ring     
 around London where building is       
 restricted.  Epsom and Ashtead Commons
 form the largest part of this block   
 and consist of wooded and open        
 grassland open to the public to enjoy 
 and also an area where animals and    
 birds can live and breed.             
                                       
 Nature trails are organised during the
 Summer months and horses are often    
 seen being riden along the many       
 signposted rides.                     
                                       
 Walkers too have many paths to follow 
 over the commons and locals living    
 around the common can be seen taking  
 their dogs for walks.
