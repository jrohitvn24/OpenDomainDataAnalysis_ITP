		<title>16Mill Farm</title>
		<content> A hundred years ago near the place    
 where Mill Farm is today there was a  
 mill that ground corn.There are still 
 remains of the site of the old mill   
 that was in use over a hundred years  
 ago. A hundred years ago the mill was 
 owned by a family called the Marshalls
 who farmed 60 acres.                  
 The Howitts live on the farm today the
 land has increased to 400 acres. The  
 land is used for cattle, there are    
 about 200. After two years of         
 fattening up they are sold on         
 Doncaster market. Half of the land is 
 for grazing and the other half is for 
 wheat and barley to feed the cattle.  
 They own Parson's Carr, no one lives  
 there now although it has been        
 inhabited by farm labourers. The only 
 things staying there now are the      
 cattle. They fertilize the grass with 
 shell and drain the land with ditches.</content>
