		<title>04Living in Frogmore in 1985.</title>
		<content> I like Frogmore because you can go for
 walks along the fields and estuary.   
 Frogmore has got a village shop which 
 has got things for your house and     
 sweets for the children. There is also
 a post office in the shop. The shop   
 sells crisps and it has bread and     
 cakes which are baked in the shop's   
 back room. I like the shop because it 
 has nice smells and there are all     
 sorts of things which are interesting.
 Outside there is a bus stop and people
 who cannot drive take the buses. These
 are some of the places the buses go   
 to, Chillington, Dartmouth, Slapton   
 and Kingsbridge. Buses come in        
 different kinds, some are double      
 deckers and some are like coaches. All
 the buses are nice to sit in. They all
 have side seats and I like them best  
 because I can see all around.
