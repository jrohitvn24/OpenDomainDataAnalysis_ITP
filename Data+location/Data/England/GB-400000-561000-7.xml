		<content>     A Typical School Day.             
                                       
 I get up at 7 o'clock and watch       
 television for fifteen minutes. While 
 my dad is getting ready for work my   
 mum is making the breakfast. My dad   
 sets off for the Co-op where he works 
 and I have my Weetabix. Then I get    
 dressed and pack my school bag. I go  
 to my neighbours as they give me a    
 lift to school.                       
 I play tig until the bell is rung and 
 then we have Assembly. Then we measure
 our sunflowers because we are trying  
 to help children in need by asking    
 friends to sponsor our sunflowers.    
 On Tuesdays we go swimming, we are    
 practising for the Gala. After        
 swimming we finish work and do        
 corrections.                          
 After lunch we may have art and then  
 rounders which I like very much.      </content>
