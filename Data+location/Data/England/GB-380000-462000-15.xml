		<title>15GAMES WE PLAY IN SETTLE (1)</title>
		<content>{SLAM:}To play slam you need a football
 and you choose a wall.You kick the    
 ball against the wall and when it     
 comes back to you,you kick it to the  
 next person.If you want you can throw 
 the ball instead and the other person 
 catches it and throws it.When the ball
 stays near the wall, you have to kick 
 it.{MONKEY:}To play Monkey you get a  
 ball and throw it to the next person. 
 If they catch it,they say a letter.The
 first one to say all the letters in   
 the word "MONKEY" can choose the next 
 game to play.{SCARECROW TIG:}You need 
 quite a few people for scarecrow tig. 
 We use a plank as 'den'.If you are    
 tug,you have to stand like a scarecrow
 until someone else tigs you,then you  
 are free and you can stand on the     
 plank so the person who's on can't tig
 you again.
