		<content> St.Andrew's Church in the centre of   
 Woodhall Spa was demolished in 1957   
 after being substantially damaged in  
 German air raids during World War Two.
 In the graveyard of the old church    
 there remains a sundial and a stone   
 monument which marks the position of  
 the old church altar.The local primary
 school is still named after this      
 church.                               
 The village now has a new church,St.  
 Peter's,a brick building constructed  
 at the end of the nineteenth century. 
 Other denominations are catered for   
 within the village which boasts a     
 Methodist and Roman Catholic church.
