		<title>17Local History of Beeley Moor</title>
		<content> The houses in the Hipper valley are   
 old, Harewood Grange being noted in   
 1486 and was formerly owned by        
 Beauchief Abbey, when it was used by  
 the monks as a penitentiary. A        
 similarly old house: Peasunhurst is   
 thought to have existed about 1645 and
 to have Quaker associations. A fairly 
 prominant feature of the area is the  
 old road which ran from Hardwick Hall 
 to Chatsworth House and reputed to be 
 one along which Bess of Hardwick      
 travelled. This is marked by circles  
 of stone, now containing deciduous    
 trees but originally built as shelters
 and markers for travellers during     
 inclement weather.                    
 The most recent disturbance of the    
 moor was in 1964 when the North Sea   
 Gas pipeline cut across the land and  
 is marked at intervals with posts     
 topped by luminous red triangles.     </content>
