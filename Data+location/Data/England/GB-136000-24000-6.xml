		<title>06Ghosts at Penrose</title>
		<content> Penrose is one of the most magnificent
 old farmhouses in West Cornwall.It was
 once a great manor,the greatest in    
 Penwith,which,even today although     
 robbed by time of much of its former  
 grandeur,retains the grace of old age.
 Penrose was a house of piracy and     
 smuggling which founded the fortunes  
 of many of our great houses.          
 Mrs Hoskins the wife of the present   
 owner of Penrose talked about the     
 trouble they were having with ghosts. 
 "I felt a presence in the room,of a   
 tall man,bending over the cot.I called
 out 'What do you want?'.There was no  
 reply,but then I sensed he was        
 standing over my bed.Although I could 
 not lift my hand to put on the light,I
 did not feel afraid.But what was odd  
 was that although the presence was    
 that of a man,I seem to remember the  
 rustling of robes."                   </content>
