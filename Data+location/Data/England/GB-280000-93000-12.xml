		<title>12MINUTES OF TEDBURN P.C. 1/2</title>
		<content> Held on 13 May 1985 at the Primary    
 School.                               
                                       
 The acoustics of the school hall were 
 so bad that it was difficult to follow
 the discussions that took place. It   
 was proposed that a letter be sent to 
 the LEA.                              
{Matters arising from the Minutes:     
 The Post Office road has been         
 resurfaced but no work done on the    
 drain. A councillor reported that it  
 would be dealt with very soon.        
{Education:}It was suggested that pay  
 negotiations should include a         
 'no-strike' clause. A councillor      
 pointed out that this was a County    
 Council matter - it was proposed that 
 no action should be taken.            
{Post Box - Woodlands:}Attempts to     
 provide a box were welcomed - support 
 to be given by letter and petition.   </content>
