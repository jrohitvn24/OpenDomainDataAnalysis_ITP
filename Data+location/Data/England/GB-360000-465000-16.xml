		<content> Bellhurst, Allcock's and Above Beck   
 are farmed as one farm by the related 
 families living in them. Between the  
 three farms there are 300 acres of    
 land, used for grazing for sheep and  
 cows, and grass for silage and hay.   
 At Allcock's Farm there was a barn    
 full of calves including some         
 Charolais. We saw the dairy and       
 milking unit. We looked at round bales
 made from the silage. In winter the   
 bales are spread out for the animals  
 to eat.                               
 At Bellhurst Farm, built in 1588,     
 water is still pumped from the well by
 hand. It takes 23 pumps to flush the  
 toilet and 4300 to fill the water     
 tank! Rushes are still collected from 
 the wetland and used for animal       
 bedding.
