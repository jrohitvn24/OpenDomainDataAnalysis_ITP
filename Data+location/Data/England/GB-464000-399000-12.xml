		<content> The {Village Hall:                    
                                       
 The building which is now the {village
{hall}was previously used as the       
 village school.In 1855 John Harvey    
 Esq. donated Â£20 annually to establish
 a church school.This remained in use  
 until 1966 when a new school was      
 built.The village hall is now used for
 youth club and playschool.            
                                       
 The {Village Green:}                  
                                       
 The village green had a huge oak tree 
 in its centre.In 1981 this became     
 diseased and had to be felled.The pond
 was once bigger than it is today,and  
 contained a 'piggy pole'to which wrong
 doers were tied as a punishment.The   
 village has two inns, 'The Harvey     
 Arms',and the 'Horse and Stag'.
