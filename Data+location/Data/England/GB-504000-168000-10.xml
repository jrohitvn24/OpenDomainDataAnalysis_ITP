		<title>10THE RIVER THAMES AT LALEHAM</title>
		<content>  The{River Thames at Laleham}meanders 
 across a wide flood plain.Upstream it 
 is flanked by private moorings and    
 adjoining riverside houses.Downstream 
 is more rural with park and farmland  
 and a campsite.Since the Laleham      
 ferry no longer functions the{Thames  
 can only be crossed at Staines or     
 Chertsey bridges.Houseboat owners on  
 the south bank row themselves across. 
  There are a small boat builders and 2
 yacht clubs.In summer the river is    
 busy with hired cruisers,sailing      
 boats,canoes and racing skiffs.       
  It is a popular area for fishermen   
 and these sadly have caused a rapid   
 decline in the swan population,due to 
 lead poisoning.96 lead shot were      
 picked up in 30 minutes on part of    
 Laleham Reach in May.Fortunately the  
 Save Our Swans society has been able  
 to aid some swans.                    </content>
