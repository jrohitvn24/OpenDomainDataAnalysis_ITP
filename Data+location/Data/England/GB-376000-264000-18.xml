		<title>18GLASSHAMPTON MONASTERY</title>
		<content> The monastery used to be the stables  
 of Glasshampton Manor which was burned
 down.In{1919 William Sirr,}a member of
 the{Society of the Divine Compassion  
 founded a house of prayer there, but  
 his stern self-discipline was not easy
 to follow and none of those who came  
 stayed. It is now used by the{Society 
{of Saint Francis}as a house of prayer.
 There are seven brothers living there 
 some of whom are elderly. The friary  
 takes in novices who stay for six     
 months.The brothers tend the garden   
 and grow some of their own food but   
 are not self-sufficient.They keep     
 bees. The friary does not have a      
 television but some of the brothers   
 have radios. The chapel is a simple   
 room with white walls and red         
 sandstone altar.Bells are rung at     
 7.00am.,12.40pm.,6.00pm. and 9.00pm.  
 before worship together in chapel.    </content>
