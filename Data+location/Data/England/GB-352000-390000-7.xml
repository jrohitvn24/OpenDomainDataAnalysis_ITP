		<title>07SUTTON MILL DAM TODAY</title>
		<content>   The water in the dam is not used for
 industry any more.  The whole area has
 been turned into a Nature Reserve. The
 Sutton Mill Dam has been bought by St.
 Helens Borough Council who have       
 recognised its value for wildlife and 
 as a place for everyone to enjoy.     
 Through Operation Groundwork new      
 footpaths are being made and many     
 other improvements made to the area.  
    A group called Sutton Mill Dam     
 Action Group are helping the          
 Groundwork Trust to introduce the     
 improved area to children in the      
 area. They and the rangers hope to    
 tell everyone of the dangers of the   
 dam but also of the many animals,     
 birds and plants they can now see in  
 the area.  Swans and ducks  can be    
 seen on each visit. The dam is also   
 now popular with fishermen.
