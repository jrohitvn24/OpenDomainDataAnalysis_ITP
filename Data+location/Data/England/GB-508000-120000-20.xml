		<content> Most of the local history material was
 taken from booklets "West Chiltington 
 in the County of Sussex", and  "West  
 Chiltington in West Sussex" (reprinted
 1984), by Sylvia Saunders-Jacobs; and 
 "The History of Shipley", by M.M.     
 Hickman (1947).                       
   We thank the farmers and nurserymen,
 home-owners, their wives and families,
 who patiently answered many questions 
 and provided information; also staff  
 at the Weald School, Billingshurst,   
 and West Chiltington and Coolham      
 Primary Schools, who were so helpful. 
   Special thanks are due to Mr Breach,
 Headmaster of the C. of E. Primary    
 School, Ashington, and to Mr and Mrs  
 Daniels, teachers of Henfield, who    
 allowed us to use their computers and 
 gave us much encouragement. Also to   
 those members of West Chiltington W.I.
 who helped and walked local footpaths.</content>
