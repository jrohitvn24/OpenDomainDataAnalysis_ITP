  In northern Hoddesdon P.C.White is   
 the{community policeman.}His role     
 reflects a change in policy by the    
 Chief Constable of Hertfordshire to   
 one where the police get out into the 
 community.                            
  P.C. White tries to involve himself  
 with young people by visiting discos  
 and youth groups. He also runs county 
 designed courses aimed at primary     
 school pupils which try to introduce  
 children to the work of the police    
 through first hand involvement.       
  The course includes talks, videos and
 role playing by the children on such  
 topics as the history of the police,  
 communications, dog handling and water
 safety. The course concludes with a   
 full scale tour of Hertford Police    
 Station, during which the children see
 the police cells and vehicles.        </content>
