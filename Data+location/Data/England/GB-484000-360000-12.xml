		<content>    Land in  this area  has always been
 used  for {farming.} There  were  many
 small  farms but  it is  now in larger
 units.                                
    In 1985{Potter Hill Farm}on the A46
 is a pig farm owned by Mr.Laird.He has
 130 sows that are kept inside  all the
 time and are fed on meal  and  cereal.
 The  sows usually  have 2.2 litters  a
 year  with  10 - 12  piglets  in  each
 litter. The  piglets  are  sold  at 20
 weeks for pork and the sows  are  kept
 until they have had 7 litters. If pigs
 are  put  with  strange pigs they will
 fight  each  other.  Mrs. Laird  keeps
 chickens and sells the eggs.          
   Farmers in this area grow root crops
 of  carrots,  parsnips,  potatoes  and
 sugar beet and some  also grow  wheat,
 barley, peas, beans and oilseed rape. 
  {High Park Farm}on Collingham Road is
 now used as Boarding Kennels.         </content>
