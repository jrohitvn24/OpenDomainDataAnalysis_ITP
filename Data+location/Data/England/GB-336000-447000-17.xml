		<content> We estimate the population of the     
 block to be 1200.Of these 900 live in 
 Preesall,and the majority of these    
 live in 3 areas,(i)on or between Sandy
 Lane and Park Lane,(ii)on the         
 Rosemount estate, or (iii) on or near 
 Pilling Lane. Those living in Pilling 
 live on Smallwood Hey,Wheel Lane,Duck 
 Street or in isolated farms or        
 cottages. The movement of population  
 tends to be into the area with a      
 tendency for some people retiring and 
 settling down in Preesall near to the 
 sea and in a place where house prices 
 are reasonable and where they enjoyed 
 days out from the inland Lancashire   
 towns.In our survey a quarter of those
 interviewed had come on those terms.In
 summer the population is increased by 
 the influx of holiday "caravanners" to
 the 4 sites (possibly as many as 200  
 people).                              </content>
