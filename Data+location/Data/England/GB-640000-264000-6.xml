		<content> Although there is as much             
 entertainment of friends in each      
 others homes as elsewhere, perhaps it 
 it is the bitter winter winds from the
 North Sea that are partly responsible 
 for much activity in knitting,        
 crocheting and in some cases spinning;
 but a country area is not only often  
 concerned with animals for livelihood,
 but the majority of dwellings have    
 dogs and cats and often other pets,   
 amongst them a few horses for riding. 
 East Green has more cats than         
 children. Certainly a greater         
 proportion of people in this area, as 
 opposed to town dwellers keep more    
 pets and practice more crafts. A      
 telephone is more a necessity than a  
 luxury. When the weather is suitable  
 time is spent out of doors, kitchen   
 gardens kept and homes well           
 maintained.                           </content>
