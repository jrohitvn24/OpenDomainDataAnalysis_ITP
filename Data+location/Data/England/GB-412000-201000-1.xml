		<content>   The local landscape is an attractive
 blend of park land and farm land.     
 There are a number of areas of        
 woodland, Lea Wood being the largest, 
 with a smaller stretch on the Ernest  
 Cook Trust property in Fairford Park. 
 The area is blessed by the beautiful  
 Coln Valley.  The water of the River  
 Coln is clear and in places fast      
 flowing.  It is famous for the quality
 of its trout, so fishing is expensive.
 The farm land is mainly used for      
 arable crops but there is some grazing
 of beef cattle, dairy cows and sheep. 
 Few people live outside the built-up  
 area of Fairford and the only roads   
 are minor ones, connecting the north  
 of Fairford to the surrounding        
 villages.  A land mark of interest is 
 Fairford Park and there are enjoyable 
 walks on the well marked footpaths.
