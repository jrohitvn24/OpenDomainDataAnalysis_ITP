		<content> Jersey has developed into a major     
 international financial centre since  
 the 1960's thanks to its low          
 taxes, political stability, good      
 worldwide communications and high     
 standard of services. 52 banks and 11 
 firms of stockbrokers have offices in 
 St.Helier.  In 1983 finance centre    
 activities produced 29% of Jersey's   
 income, being the major generator of  
 economic growth. Over 70% of the      
 deposits held by banks in the island  
 are in foreign currencies. Low taxes  
 are the result of careful budgeting to
 meet local expenditure. Income tax is 
 applied to all incomes at a rate of   
 20%; there are a limited number of    
 indirect taxes, but no V.A.T., death  
 duties or other taxes on capital.     
 Corporation tax is charged at a flat  
 rate of Â£300 on non-resident          
 incorporated companies only.          </content>
