		<title>16  A DAY IN SUMMER</title>
		<content> At 7.30am I got up, prepared breakfast
 for Helen,Richard and myself_ John had
 been up since 6am cutting a field of  
 grass.After breakfast I got Helen and 
 Richard dressed,washed up and then    
 went to feed the hens and let them    
 out.I then went to Masham to collect  
 some cattle feed.After coffee with    
 John I prepared lunch.Lunch over we   
 all went to the field to help bag the 
 bales of silage.At 5pm I came home to 
 pack us a picnic tea up.I took it back
 to the field, then we carried on with 
 the silage until 6.45pm.By then       
 Richard was getting tired so we came  
 home. I bathed Helen and Richard, got 
 them their supper and put them to bed 
 about 8.00pm.After washing up I       
 decided to do some baking and I       
 finished that at 9.30pm.By 10.30 I had
 had a bath, we'd eaten supper and were
 ready for bed. {Kathleen Stockil }    </content>
