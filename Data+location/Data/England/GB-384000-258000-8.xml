		<content> This site was mentioned in the        
 Domesday Book as 'Hisndeted with eight
 inhabitants'. Since then there have   
 been several different buildings on   
 the site with the present main hall   
 dating from 1820. It has been used as 
 a private house, boarding school and a
 military hospital (1939-1945). Since  
 1946 it has been a police             
 Headquarters, originally for          
 Worcestershire and in more recent     
 years for the West Mercia Constabulary
 - covering Shropshire, Herefordshire  
 and Worcestershire. We saw the main   
 operations room where there are many  
 computers and tv cameras monitoring   
 the M5 motorway. We saw the police    
 dogs in training and examined the     
 motorway patrol vehicles. We also     
 visted the small 16th C church        
 adjacent to the Hall.
