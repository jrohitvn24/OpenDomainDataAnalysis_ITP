		<content>  Our community has many hopes and     
 aspirations for the future.           
                                       
  Full employment is obviously a top   
 priority.                             
                                       
  A local survey showed that these were
 some of the desires of the people:    
                                       
  "A sports complex to include a track.
 Many promising athletes and sportsmen 
 are lost because there are no         
 facilities for them after they reach  
 school leaving age."                  
                                       
  "A park to include a collection of   
 zoological specimens would bring      
 visitors and trade."                  
                                       
   "More adequate parking facilities   
 are needed with the increasing        
 congestion of vehicles."              </content>
