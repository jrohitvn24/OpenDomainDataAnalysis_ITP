 clean the prison.                     
  In the evenings there are educational
 classes for the prisoners to attend if
 they wish or they can take up hobbies 
 such as soft toy making, painting or  
 making models with matchsticks.       
  Every year there is an exhibition and
 sale of the prisoners' paintings and  
 crafts in the village and money from  
 the sale goes to charity.             
  Each wing has its own T.V. and videos
 are shown at the week-ends. There is a
 gymnasium in the prison where the     
 prisoners can play table tennis, five-
 a-side football, badminton or do      
 gymnastics or weight training. They   
 also exercise for one hour every day. 
  The prison also has a chapel and on  
 Sundays about 60 prisoners attend the 
 morning service and 90 attend in the  
 evening when they can play guitars.   </content>
