		<content>                                       
 The{Henderson Theatre}has become a    
 centre for amateur and professional   
 activities.                           
 It is small and the atmosphere is     
 intimate.                             
 It is visited from time to time by    
 organisations as august as the        
 Scottish National Opera.              
 Film shows are held there on occasion,
  as it possesses a projection room.   
 The drawback is that for some events  
 it is too small-its capacity being    
 around 100 seats.                     
 Larger shows,such as the opera are    
 held in Calderhead School Hall.       
  The{Calderhead Community Centre      
 in which the theatre is situated,is   
 available also for sporting,social and
 educational activities.{The Old School
{Community Centre}is also active.
