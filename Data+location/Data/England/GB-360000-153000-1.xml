		<title>01RURAL AREA ON MENDIP HILLS</title>
		<content> This block lies on the northern side  
 of the Mendip hills, the land rising  
 steeply from 350 feet to 525 feet. The
 whole area is rural in appearance, no 
 industry whatsoever: the land being   
 mainly rough grazing enclosed by      
 limestone walls on the flat plain on  
 the height but generally bounded by   
 hedges on the lowerland. Two ancient  
 woods clothe the northern slopes,     
 mainly coniferous and used for timber.
 Land is used mainly for dairy farming.
 A few of the  fields are intensively  
 managed grassland and occasional crops
 of maize for animal feed. Potatoes are
 grown as a cash crop by several       
 farmers. The two small villages of    
 Farrington Gurney (population 587) and
 Ston Easton (pop 501) are bisected by 
 main roads linking Bristol, Bath,     
 Wells and Shepton Mallett and are     
 mainly occupied by commuters          </content>
