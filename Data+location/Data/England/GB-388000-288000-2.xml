		<content> The landscape around Kingswinford is  
 fairly uneven due to mining in the    
 past. The{soil}is very mixed ranging  
 from sand to clay.                    
 There is quite a lot of{open ground}  
 and{pools}around the Dawley Brook and 
 Wallows Industrial Estate. The Fens   
 Pools are surrounded by coarse grass  
 and wasteland, unlike the Dawley Brook
 area which is mainly flat.            
 The{factories}are mainly made of steel
 and corrugated iron although some are 
 brick and plastic.                    
 Most of the area is now covered by    
{houses}made of brick with roofs of    
 tiles or slates.                      
 The{roadsides}are mainly lined with   
 trees which include cherry blossom,   
 sycamore and horse chestnut.
