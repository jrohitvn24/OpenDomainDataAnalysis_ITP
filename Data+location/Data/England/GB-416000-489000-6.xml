		<title>06THE SCHOOL</title>
		<content>{ }The only primary{school}within the  
 designated area is at Constable       
 Burton.Older children travel to       
 Leyburn to the secondary school.The   
 school at Constable Burton is built of
 stone.It has a bell tower but the bell
 is no longer used.                    
                                       
   There are 2 classrooms.One is bigger
 than the other,and they are joined by 
 an archway.The juniors use the larger 
 room.The school is now heated by      
 electricity,although there used to be 
 a coal stove.                         
                                       
   At the side there is a playground   
 which is covered in tarmac and marked 
 out for hockey.At the top of the      
 playground is a small lawn where the  
 children play in summer.
