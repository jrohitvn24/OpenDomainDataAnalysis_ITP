		<title>16The Motorway.</title>
		<content> The stetch of the M1 dominates the    
 area. It is situated less than 60     
 metres from Blackburn School,making it
 possibly the closest to a motorway in 
 England.A survey was taken in June    
 1985 by a group of children.They      
 studied traffic on both North and     
 South bound lanes from a footbridge   
 close to the school.In a five minute  
 period from 11.35a.m. to 11.40a.m.,122
 vehicles were heading North,129 were  
 heading South.Almost 2 out of 5       
 vehicles were lorries or vans.One     
 vehicle passed the onlooker almost    
 every second.This was also not one of 
 the busiest times. When the motorway  
 was built in our area in 1968,one     
 local road had to be demolished to    
 make way for it. A huge embankment    
 several metres high has been built to 
 take the motorway above the Blackburn 
 Valley.                               </content>
