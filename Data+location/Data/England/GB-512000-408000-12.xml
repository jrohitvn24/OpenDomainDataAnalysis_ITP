		<title>12LIFE IN OUR VILLAGE</title>
		<content> Strangely the children in the         
 community play very few traditional   
 games. Unlike children in town and    
 city schools who have quite a number  
 of skipping rhymes,children in this   
 area have none. This may well be due  
 to the fact that we have so very few  
 people move into the area. Most of the
 children have parents who have lived  
 in this locality for a considerable   
 time. Those who have moved into the   
 area have come from places not too far
 afield and tend to have come from     
 places similiar  to this environment. 
 A Maypole Dance was held annually some
 years ago but is now no longer held   
 possibly due to the influence of T.V. 
 or peoples reluctance to become       
 involved in carrying on traditions.   
 The school forms a very important part
 of the holding the community together.
 Without it,the village would die.     </content>
