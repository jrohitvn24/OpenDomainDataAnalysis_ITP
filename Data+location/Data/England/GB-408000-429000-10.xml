		<content> A Rhodesway school        
 teacher.                              
 Most people would have there famly    
 living in Queensbury. I was brought up
 in Queensbury and friends from about  
 2 years old still live in Queensbury. 
 When I want to entertain my/self I    
 take the dog for a walk or do abit of 
 gardening like I say Queensbury is    
 almost Isloted. There are a few nice  
 pubs in Queensbury. There is almost   
 no  polution in Queensbury because    
 its all farming land and grass land.  
 As in Bradford there's all the        
 factories and mills working all day.  
 There's some factories in Queensbury  
 but only a few.                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
