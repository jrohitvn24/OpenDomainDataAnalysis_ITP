		<title>19The Buildings of Nantwich.</title>
		<content>    Nantwich is a town which contains  
 many interesting properties, the      
 majority of which are rooted in the   
 town's historic past.{Churche's       
{Mansion}is a restaurant today but is  
 also open as a museum.The tilted black
 and white walls and low ceilings of   
 the{Crown  Hotel}attract many locals  
 and visitors for food,drink or a bed. 
  There are excellent examples of      
 many different periods and styles of  
 architecture including Tudor,Georgian,
 and Edwardian.The names of the streets
 such as{Oat Market,Swine Market and   
{Castle St,}and public houses including
 the Boot and Shoe,the Wilbraham Arms, 
 the Cheshire Cheese to name but a few 
 reflect the community, past and       
 present.In recent years the town has  
 become well-known in Cheshire for its 
 nightclubs,{the Cheshire Cat}in Welsh 
 Row being the most famous.            </content>
