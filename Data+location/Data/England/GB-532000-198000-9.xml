 In the Bulls Cross area many factories
 and industries are closing down or    
 working short time.                   
 One incident occured recently atthe   
 Thorn EMI factory. 500 people were    
 made redundant including three of my  
 Nan's friends. This was a particularly
 serious matter as there is limited    
 employment in the area which is mostly
 Green Belt land, which means land that
 cannot be developed. In Britain, over 
 3.8 million people queue up to sign on
 at a job centre every week to collect 
 their dole or Social Security money.
