		<title>09INTERVIEW WITH A VILLAGER</title>
		<content> Mr. Stickland was born at Reperry in  
 the parish of Lanivet in{1900.}He went
 to school at Lanivet and had a rough  
 time.There were about 115 children    
 then. As there were no school dinners 
 he had to go home.The Green was wet,  
 boggy land with rushes. He said that  
 when girls were naughty they had a    
 slap across the legs, boys were given 
 the cane.He had to ride a bike to     
 school and had to go to church and    
 Sunday School.                        
 Mr. Stickland's first car was a       
 'bull-nosed'Morris. He can remember   
 the first aeroplane landing at St.    
 Mawgan near Newquay and a lady        
 fainted! He worked horses on his      
 farm (his father was a tenant farmer) 
 and rode to Liskeard Market every time
 it was on.
