		<title>06BMX Track in Stoke</title>
		<content> In Stoke on Sunday we went down to the
 BMX (Bicycle motor-cross) track and   
 had lots of fun. First of all we went 
 on the Berm. A{Berm}is a half spoon   
 shape made from dirt. You have the    
 Berm for racing and freestyle. The    
{Tabletop}is a  square with kerbs on   
 front and back. A{Speed Jump}is a hump
 which you can wheelie over. A{wheelie 
 is lifting the front wheel off the    
 ground and pedalling fast. A{Bomb Hole
 is a hole which you jump across. The  
 second{Berm}is for freestyle. Moves we
 can do on the Berm are drop in ,      
 ariels, roll back, spin back and      
 kickturn.{Whoops}are two humps        
 together which you can jump or wheelie
 over. A{BMX Bicycle}is different from 
 an ordinary bicycle. It is stronger.  
 It has a gusset on the handle bars and
 another on the frame to strengthen it.
 A{gusset}is a trianguler shape.       </content>
