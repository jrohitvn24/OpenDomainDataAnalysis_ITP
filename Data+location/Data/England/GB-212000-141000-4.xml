		<title>04Archaeologists at the Castle</title>
		<content> On Tuesday we went to Marisco Castle. 
 David Thackery,Archaeologist to the   
 National Trust,showed us round.       
 Although known as Marisco Castle the  
 pirate Marisco's have nothing to do   
 with it.It was built after them- and  
 rebuilt in 1643 by mintmaster and     
 Royalist Thomas Bushell.It is this    
 occupation that they plan to reveal   
 and preserve.                         
 Digging started in August 1984 when   
 only the tops of the walls could be   
 seen.While we were there members of a 
 N.T.Acorn workcamp were helping with  
 the dig.So far they have found a big  
 room with a fireplace,a clay bread    
 oven,a furnace, a brick building with 
 a cobbled floor and the drilling      
 yard.They have also found pottery,    
 pocket knives, buttons, thimbles,     
 cannonballs and coins-one showing King
 Luke of Ireland.    {David Hinchliffe.</content>
