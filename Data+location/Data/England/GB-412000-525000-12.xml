		<title>12Randolph Coke Works</title>
		<content> Until May 1984 the largest local      
 industrial employer in the area was   
 the Randolph Coke &amp; Chemical Works.It 
 was also one of the largest rate      
 payers in the whole of Teesdale       
 District.The coal mine &amp; buildings    
 were originaly built in the early     
 1900's.In 1948 the large battery of   
 coke ovens was built.It had 15 ovens  
 and cost approximately Â£150,000.The   
 second battery which had 11 ovens was 
 built in 1958.Up until this time they 
 were owned by Sodlers.In September    
 1968 the ovens were bought by Hope,   
 Evens &amp; Tremewam who in turn sold them
 in 1970 to Bank Bridge.Bank Bridge    
 sold to British Benyal in 1978 and    
 they sold to Coalite in March 1981.By 
 May 1984 Coalite found that they could
 no longer keep the works going and    
 they were closed down.The Chimney &amp;   
 Bunker were blown up in December 1984.</content>
