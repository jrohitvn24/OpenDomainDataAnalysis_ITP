		<title>03Ecology-Urban &amp; Moss Valley</title>
		<content> The Moss Valley management project,set
 up by local authorities and           
 the countryside commission,has a      
 variety of habitats.These include     
 rivers which support trout,crayfish   
 and voles.Kingfishers and woodpeckers 
 are quite common.Foxes,badgers,grey   
 squirrels and rabbits are also        
 to be found.The land to the north of  
 White Lane is principally housing but 
 foxes have been seen in the area.     
 The pollution in the urban environment
 is high due to litter.A local survey  
 showed that most people said they     
 never dumped rubbish.Nobody knows if  
 dangerous chemicals have been         
 dumped.The local stream is polluted by
 mattresses,carpets,tyres,paper,bike   
 frames and oil.The public Dumpit tip  
 on Blackstock Rd. was opened in 1968, 
 but this has not completely solved the
 rubbish problem!                      </content>
