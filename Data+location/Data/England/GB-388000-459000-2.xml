		<content>{Airton}is the largest village in the  
 block,and was originally built around 
 the village green.The name "Airton"   
 means "Town on the River Aire".       
 Although it did have its own          
 school,this was closed in 1974 and the
 children came to Kirkby Malham School.
 It has its own Post Office and village
 shop(this seels mainly sweets),and a  
 garage which sells petrol as well as  
 repairs cars.                         
 Between Airton and Kirkby Malham there
 are several farms,including Manor     
 House Farm,Dykelands,Skellands and    
 Stoneybers.At Skellands,part of the   
 buildings have been given over to car 
 repairs.
