		<title>09The White Cross Estate   (C)</title>
		<content>The White Cross Estate was formerly    
owned by Storeys, who made rubber and  
plastic products.In 1981 Storeys       
closed the factory which employed 2000 
people. In August 1983 the site was    
bought by Lancashire Enterprises Ltd,  
a company set up by Lancashire County  
Council to try and provide more job    
opportunities in the county at a time  
of high unemployment.At present this is
14.6% locally.Some of the buildings are
being demolished but it is planned to  
keep and restore the stone buildings   
There are 46 activities catered for so 
far,including some rubber production,  
candle making and fibre-glass products.
The site will also include social and  
residential zones.Some houses are to   
be built on that part of the site near 
to Springfield Steet.There is an       
office zone near the main entrance.
