		<content>   Wicket Football _ we have two posts 
 for wickets and another about 10      
 metres away to run round. One team    
 fields and the other team takes turns 
 at kicking the ball,bowled at the     
 wickets. We run for every bowl. You   
 can be out if a wicket falls or if you
 are caught.                           
   Off Ground Touch _ one person is "on
 it", the rest are off ground. As you  
 run from one safe place to another you
 may be caught,then you are "on it" and
 you have to catch anyone running on   
 the ground.                           
   Stuck in the Mud _ this game is     
 played after it has been raining. One 
 person is "on it",they have to push   
 the others into the mud i.e.the parts 
 of the playground which have not dried
 up. When you have been stuck in the   
 mud you are "on it".
