		<content> In this urban area we found that most 
 of the shops are food shops. Three    
 shops, at Dodford, Fairfield and      
 Catshill, have a corner of the shop as
 the local Post Office. Two of the     
 shops are farm shops selling local    
 produce; vegetables, fruit, plants.   
 Bourneheath did have a shop until 1983
 but then it closed as it was          
 uneconomic. Locla residents have to   
 walk to Fairfield or go to Bromsgrove 
 to do their shopping.
