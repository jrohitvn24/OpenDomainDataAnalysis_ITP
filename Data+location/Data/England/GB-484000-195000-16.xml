classes are enjoyed here.Football and  
Cricket Clubs are supported in Downley 
and Naphill.The sport enjoyed most by  
boys is football while girls favour    
dancing and gymnastics.                
    A very high proportion of children 
are members of the Scouting &amp; Guiding  
Association and some parents give up   
much time to organise their meetings   
and camps,training to do so.           
    Horticultural Societies flourish in
all the villages with shows and visits 
in the summer and meetings in the      
winter.Women's Institutes are well     
attended.                              
    Each village holds a fete day in   
the summer.Local Commons,Hughenden Park
and public footpaths for walking are   
all used by the local population at    
times.
