 It was 10.30am. I went and looked for 
 Dad. I found him mending the mower so 
 that he could go and mow Chapel       
 Meadow. I saw Nan who was doing some  
 gardening. Then I went and helped Mum 
 who was cooking dinner. It was a fry  
 up of bacon, eggs, tomatoes and       
 mushrooms with bread and butter, and  
 for pudding, jelly and ice-cream.     
  After dinner it was so hot that I    
 paddled in our pool, then sun bathed  
 and read a book called Tilly Trotter  
 by Catherine Cookson. Joanne and      
 Andrew played cowboys and Indians.    
  At 4pm Mum and I fetched the cows for
 milking. After tea I fed my calves    
 then watched television until bedtime 
 at 10.30pm.                           
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
