		<content>  The main annual festival is the      
 Headon Well Dressing. It is held on   
 St.Peters' Day and the following week 
 (the end of June). Pictures are made  
 on the well by pressing flower petals 
 into clay. The main petals used are   
 ones that will last, such as Hydrangea
 and Sweet William. Moss is also used  
 as are evergreens.                    
  The well dressing was started in 1981
 to raise money for the church. It was 
 also hoped that the festival would    
 stop the well being filled in and     
 wrecked. It succeeded.                
  Another main festival is the flower  
 festival that is held in Headon       
 Church.                               
  Christmas Carols are sung every year 
 and the local school choir (Bramcote) 
 occasionally sing in the church.Other 
 local customs include Bonfire Night,  
 Halloween, Harvest and First Footing. </content>
