		<title>18A WALK ON THE MOORS</title>
		<content> Today Fisons have the right to dig    
 peat which they sell for fertilizer   
 and commercial plant-raising.         
                                       
         {ON THE MOORS 1985}           
   When we went on the moors with Mr.  
 Eversham, he took us down the council 
 strip and onto the moors. To get onto 
 the moors we had to cross a ditch. We 
 went down a path at the side of a     
 barley field, we crossed a small      
 bridge and went through some trees. We
 walked through some bracken, which was
 about 5ft 6inches tall. A little      
 farther on we came to some peat       
 cuttings. We had walked quite a long  
 way when we saw the holes in the      
 ground. Where we were walking was     
 about 4ft higher than the bottom of   
 the holes. The holes were long        
 trenches, like the ones in the war    
 that soldiers used to shelter in.     </content>
