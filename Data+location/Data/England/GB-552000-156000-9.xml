		<title>09Kemsing - a Downland Village</title>
		<content> Despite an explosion of building and  
population since the war, this village 
nestling at the foot of the North Downs
still displays great natural beauty    
with farming and arable land a         
predominant feature.                   
As in other Kentish villages, thanks to
conservation, the {St.Edith's Well}    
area of Kemsing is protected, therefore
retaining some of its history and old  
world charm.                           
Typical of similar communities, the    
need to work on the land has diminished
and people mainly commute to           
surrounding towns and London for work. 
Leisure time is spent tending gardens, 
enjoying the surrounding countryside or
attending one or more of the varied    
clubs/societies which have proved so   
beneficial in bringing the people      
together to form a good community      
spirit.                                </content>
