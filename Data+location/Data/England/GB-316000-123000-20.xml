		<title>20The Hamlet of Barr. Credits</title>
		<content>   Barr House is owned by Lord and Lady
 Skelmersdale and it lies in the tiny  
 hamlet called Barr just below Bishops 
 Hull.  Lord Skelmersdale was at a     
 party political conference at         
 Blackpool but we spoke to his wife.   
  He is a Government Whip (which is a  
 Minister of the Government in the     
 House of Lords).  He has also been a  
 Lord-in-Waiting to the Queen since    
 1981, and is President of the Somerset
 Trust for Nature Conservation.  He    
 owns a large house and runs Broadleigh
 Gardens, where there is a bulb nursery
 occasionally open to the public.      
                                       
{The research in this block was done by
{some boys from Taunton Junior School  
{as a voluntary hobby, and then was    
{finished by Form 5M in October 1985 as
{a class project with help from Miss C.
{Spearey, Mr.B.Brown, &amp; Mr.R.Craddock. </content>
