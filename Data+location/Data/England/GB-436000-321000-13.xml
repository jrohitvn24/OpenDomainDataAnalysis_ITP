		<content> More than half the area was formerly  
 taken up by Calke &amp; Staunton Harold   
 private estates. This has meant almost
 no building other than farmhouses,    
 lodges to estates, gamekeepers'       
 cottages &amp; cottages for other estate  
 workers has taken place over the past 
 200 years. Most of these, now         
 renovated, have passed into private   
 hands.                                
 In style the cottages follow a        
 similar architectural pattern using   
 timber, stone &amp; narrow brick - all    
 three in some cases, with slate       
 roofs,except for three which are      
 attractively thatched. Being within or
 on the perimeter of parkland,they     
 stand in ideal rural settings, &amp; all  
 the occupants state that they would   
 not live anywhere else.
