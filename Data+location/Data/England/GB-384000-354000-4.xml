Our twelve squares cover an area of    
Kidsgrove that have been used for coal 
mining iron ore exploitation and other 
minor mineral workings such as sand    
and rock quarrying.                    
 As a result of this mining the area   
is absolutely covered with derelict    
land,old mine shafts and ancillary     
buildings.                             
 Large areas of land in kidsgrove have 
not been deliberately reclaimed but    
have acquired a natural appearance.    
In Kidsgrove the largest reclamation   
scheme is at Birchenwood where open    
cast mining took place.    The Loop    
line that fed B'wood is to be made     
into a walkway.  Other derelict land   
in Kidsgrove has been reclaimed as     
sports fields and an adult training    
centre eg.Gloucester Rd.
