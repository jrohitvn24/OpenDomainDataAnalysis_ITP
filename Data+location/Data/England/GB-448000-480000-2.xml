		<title>02THE NATIONAL PARK</title>
		<content> Half the area falls within the North  
 Yorkshire National Park which was set 
 up in 1952.  The Boundaries follow the
 old Parish Borders or roads.          
 The Park Officers mark footpaths, set 
 out Nature Trails and institute some  
 tree planting,mainly coniferous.  The 
 Park Land is privately owned and is   
 leased by the Forestry Commission.    
 At the top of Sutton Bank there is an 
 Information Centre  and two large car 
 parks.  This centre is situated on the
 Cleveland Way, a Long_Distance        
 Footpath.                             
 The whole Park is divided into        
 sections each controlled by a Ranger. 
 The Central Office for the Park is at 
 Helmsley.
