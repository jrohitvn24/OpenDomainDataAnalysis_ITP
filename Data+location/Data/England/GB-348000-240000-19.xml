		<title>19VISIT OF MAYOR OF HEREFORD</title>
		<content> In law you have to be 21 years old to 
 be Mayor though usually mayors are a  
 lot older . You have to be elected    
 councillor first.Councilor Strouckan  
 is responsible for everyone in the    
 city and for seeing that the city is  
 kept clean and things work properly   
 .He is so often asked to open new buil
 dings  or name things like the railway
 engine Evening Star.Sometimes he is   
 given presents to remind him of his   
 year as mayor, for example he was     
 given a painting of the 'Evening      
 Star'.The chain the Mayor wears is    
 gold and weighs 2lbs.It is quite      
 historic and some of the medallions   
 have been presented by different      
 groups.One was presented by the S.A.S.
 The mayoress wears a much lighter     
 chain.
