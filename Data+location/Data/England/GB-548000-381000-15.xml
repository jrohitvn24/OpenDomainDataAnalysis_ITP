		<title>15Our View of Sutton on Sea.</title>
		<content> I think Sutton is a quaint and        
 bustling village attracting many      
 holiday makers.Before I came to Sutton
 I lived in Long Eaton.It was a busy   
 market town.I didn't like it there    
 because of all the petrol fumes.I     
 prefer Sutton _{Matthew Lockley       
                                       
 I like most things in Sutton- all the 
 shops, the paddling pool and the      
 donkeys on the beach in the summer.It 
 is nice to live in Sutton because all 
 your friends are near.I think there   
 should be more attractions.I wouldn't 
 always like to live here as I would   
 like a change _{Samantha Shave        
                                       
 I like Sutton because it is a quiet   
 place.When I'm older I would rather   
 see the rest of the world because     
 Sutton is a nice place and there may  
 be somewhere like it _{Rebecca French </content>
