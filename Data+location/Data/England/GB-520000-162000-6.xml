		<title>06PERSONAL TRANSPORT</title>
		<content> Almost every family in our survey has 
 a car of its own;one or two hve a     
 truck or a van.All the children are   
 wellaccustomed to car transport,though
 very few come to school reguarly by   
 car.They mostly walk,using a car only 
 if the weather is wet.Most family     
 outings,some of which involve long    
 journeys,are by car. Shopping         
 expeditions are also made by          
 car.Several families have two         
 qualified drivers,and several have two
 cars.                                 
 Many children own a biycle,which is   
 principally used as a toy rather than 
 a form of transport.All the           
 children ride their bicycles in their 
 own garden,the local park or on the   
 pavement in the vicinity of their own 
 home.
