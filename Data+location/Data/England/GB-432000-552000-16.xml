		<content>   There are lots of{Pubs}in Shiney Row
 and Penshaw and they both have a{Club 
 and a community centre. The YMCA is in
 Herrington Burn which is quite popular
 with the young people.                
   The pubs include The Shoulder of    
 Mutton, The Odd Fellows Arms, The Grey
 Horse, The Prospect, The Travellers   
 Rest, The Monument and The Lambton    
 Arms.At The Prospect they have a Quiz 
 Night which is very popular.          
   The{YMCA}holds quite a number of    
 events ranging from Karate, Judo,     
 Junior Night and the YMCA Gala. This  
 is held at the beginning of June.It is
 always opened by a famous person and  
 this year and last it was Ken Dodd.   
   In our survey we found that only a  
 small number of people in Shiney Row  
 went outside of the community for     
 their leisure pursuits and these were 
 for sporting hobbies eg. squash.      </content>
