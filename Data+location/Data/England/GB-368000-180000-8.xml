		<title>08ST MARY'S CHURCH</title>
		<content> The oldest parts of the church date   
 back to the 12th century.The font     
 is 15th century and is in the west    
 side of the church.You can still see  
 the remains of an old staircase which 
 used to lead up to a tower, which fell
 down into the church.In 1859 new pews 
 were put in,but now these too have    
 been taken away.As well as church     
 services there is a pre_school play   
 group for small children.For the Yate 
 festival(which is held in July) they  
 hold an art exhibition and a musical  
 concert.Later on in September there is
 a flower festival in the church.
