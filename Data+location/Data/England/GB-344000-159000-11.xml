  We were doing a survey of where      
 parents work and what they do.We      
 surveyed all of the eleven year old   
 children attending County Primary     
 Schools in our area.Many fathers      
 travel to work in Bristol, 14         
 fathers worked there.5 fathers work   
 in Weston.One father works in Bath.   
 Another 14 fathers work locally in    
 Churchill,Langford,Wrington and       
 Shipham.All fathers are employed.Some 
 fathers work in other districts;      
 Leicester,Portishead and Oxford.Eight 
 children's fathers had to travel 50   
 miles per day at least 3 days a       
 week.We found out that 9 people work  
 at home.24 people work in an office, 7
 fathers didn't work in either. Then we
 asked people what their dad's job was.
 Only 5 had the same job.13 fathers had
 company cars.                         </content>
