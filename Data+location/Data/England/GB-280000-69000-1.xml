		<content> The main village in our area is       
 Ogwell and is close to a market town  
 called{Newton Abbot,}which is about 3 
 miles away. We are still in the       
 country and you wouldn't believe that 
 we live so close to a town.We live in 
 a rural area with isolated farms      
 scattered over the countryside.       
 We are close to the motorway and      
 we have railway links nearby.There is 
 a pub in the village called{The Jolly 
{Sailor}and also a church, a Post      
 Office and a Memorial Hall.There are  
 lots of walks and we are close to the 
 sea which is about 6 miles away.Our   
 part of the country is a lovely place,
 and well worth a visit.There is       
 another village nearby called{Denbury 
 which has the same conveniences.
