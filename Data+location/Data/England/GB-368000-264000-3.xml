		<content> Farming is a financial business today 
 and governed by  EEC regulations.     
 There are more farm buildings for     
 rearing and wintering sheep, cattle   
 and pigs.  The land is intensively    
 farmed, scrubland being reclaimed and 
 used for production of cash crops.    
 Headage of dairy cows will now stay   
 constant since the introduction of the
 milk quotas. Sheep numbers are going  
 up as there is an annual ewe headage  
 premium paid and a Government subsidy 
 on the sale price. Beef cattle are    
 reared intensively, feeding on silage,
 hay and concentrates. Farm machinery  
 is more efficient and larger to work  
 the fields, where many hedges have    
 been removed.Orchards have almost     
 disappeared from here,grants were paid
 for grubbing and clearing them. More  
 productive crops,eg. cereal or potato,
 are grown.                            </content>
