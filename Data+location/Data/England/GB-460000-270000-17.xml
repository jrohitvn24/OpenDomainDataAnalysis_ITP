		<title>17Village housing-concerns</title>
		<content>Lack of new housing in the village is  
of great local concern. Present Local  
Authority plans only allow for         
infilling within the existing          
boundaries of the village. This type   
of housing is generally of the more    
expensive type and is therefore        
commonly sold to people in their       
midlife with existing, frequently      
teenage, children. The effect is that  
the number on roll at the local school 
has steadily declined. Young adults    
leaving home have to move out of the   
village to buy their first house. The  
trend towards an older and more        
affluent population puts stress upon   
local amenities. The local Parish      
Council would like a new development   
of twenty to thirty houses suitable    
for first time buyers, to revitalise   
the village without changing  ng its   
character.                             </content>
