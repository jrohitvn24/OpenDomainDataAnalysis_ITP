		<title>14MITCHELDEAN PUBLIC LIBRARY</title>
		<content>   Before 1983, the nearest public     
 library was in Cinderford, but in the 
 spring of that year a new library was 
 opened in the centre of Mitcheldean.  
 It was built on a piece of waste      
 ground which had resulted from earlier
 widening of the High Street. It is    
 built of reconstructed stone which is 
 an excellent match with the Old Red   
 Sandstone of some of the older town   
 centre buildings.                     
   There is plenty of space inside, and
 a good selection of books. There is an
 attractive childrens section with     
 facilities for games such as chess,   
 and the entrance lobby has a display  
 area for local history, forthcoming   
 events, and jobs available in the     
 area. Cassettes and tapes can also be 
 borrowed, and there is a picture      
 lending service.
