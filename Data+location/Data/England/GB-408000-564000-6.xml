		<content>   'The Wylam Globe' is a quarterly    
 newsletter produced by the Wylam      
 Parish Council giving residents       
 information about what the council is 
 doing and other issues of general     
 interest relating to the village.     
   The first issue of the Globe was in 
 July 1973.'The Globe' was chosen as   
 the newsletters name due to links with
 two famous Wylam families.One of the  
 early locomotives built by Timothy    
 Hackworth was called the 'The Globe'.

 newspaper in the nineteenth century

 member of the family who were the     
 'squires of Wylam' for nearly 300

 and distinguished contributor.
