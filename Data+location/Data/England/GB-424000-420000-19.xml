		<title>19MY HOUSE IN CHICKENLEY</title>
		<content> Our house is semi-detached and it is  
 on a council estate.It is made of     
 brick with a tile roof. In my house   
 there are 6 rooms,the kitchen, living 
 room, 3 bedrooms, the bathroom and the
 toilet is in a separate room. At the  
 front and back of my house are gardens
 with green grass and lovely flowers.  
 Sometimes I play in the garden with a 
 ball.                                 
 In my house we have a television which
 I sometimes  watch . When it is cold  
 I turn on the gas fire.We also have a 
 gas cooker but we have electric       
 lighting.                             
 I have 2 brothers and 4 sisters and my
 mother does all the preparing for our 
 meals.For breakfast I normally have   
 toast with lots of butter. For        
 Sunday dinner we have chicken, peas,  
 carrots and stuffing. Ater dinner we  
 wash the plates with a scrubber.      </content>
