		<content> Wednesday.                            
 On Wednesday it's P.E.                
 The lesson I like the best.           
 We use the big apparatus.             
 After which we all need a rest.       
 For breakfast it's bacon.             
 For dinner I eat beans on toast.      
 At tea we eat corned beef sandwiches. 
 My brother Alistair takes the most.   
 Thursday.                             
 It's swimming today,I'm happy to say. 
 At 10.00 we go to the baths.          
 In the space of 1 hour,we are back on 
 the bus,                              
 Which is full of crisp packets and    
 laughs.                               
 At the Ramblers club to-night,        
 I have 20p to pay.                    
 We do a lot of interesting things,but 
 We don't go on rambles until Sunday.
