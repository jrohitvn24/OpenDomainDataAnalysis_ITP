		<title>06ST.JOHNS CHAPEL MART (3)</title>
		<content>    When the farmers made their bids   
 they did it in different ways. Some   
 put their hands up , some touched     
 their noses and some raised their     
 sticks. We saw some cows sold for     
 Â£300.                                 
   St Johns Chapel Mart was established
 in 1896. There are 11 marts in a year.
 The stock sold at the mart are cattle 
 and sheep. The two biggest sales are  
 the Pedigree and Swaledale Ram sale   
 and the Store Cattle and Suckler Calf 
 sale.                                 
   The biggest sales start at about    
 10am and finish at about 7pm. The     
 smaller sales last approximately 4    
 hours. There are about 5 part time    
 workers at the mart. Mr. Peart has    
 been auctioneer for nearly 20 years.  
   From time to time there are also    
 sales of household goods.
