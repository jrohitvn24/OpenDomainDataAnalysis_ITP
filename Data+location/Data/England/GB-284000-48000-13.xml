		<content> Our school goes on a lot of day and   
 residential visits,as part of our     
 projects.We are able to talk while we 
 work,we have team-meetings in our     
 practical area to discuss our area's  
 activities.The top juniors have a     
 team-teaching system,a different      
 teacher takes us for language,art     
 environmental studies and maths.      
 On Wednesday afternoons we choose     
 different clubs, small group may go on
 an outing or we do arts and crafts. We
 have a hall where we are able to do   
 gym,P.E. dance and drama in the       
 winter. Every child has their own     
 tray in which they keep their own     
 property.The younger children do      
 painting and drawing.They also have   
 an extra playtime in the afternoon.   
 I wish that we could do more work in  
 the afternoon and less games outside.
