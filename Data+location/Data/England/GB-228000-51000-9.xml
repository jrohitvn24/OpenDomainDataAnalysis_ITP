		<content> MOST LOCAL CRAFT HAVE BEEN CLINKER    
 BUILT WOODEN BOATS.NOW MANY OF THE    
 CRAFT ARE FORMED OF GLASS FIBRE,A MUCH
 LIGHTER CONSTRUCTION.SOME OF THESE    
 BOATS ARE USED FOR PART TIME AND HOBBY
 FISHING,OR FAMILY VISITS TO SECLUDED  
 COVES.ABOUT SIX  SMALL CATAMARANS AND 
 MONOHULLS WITH CENTRE BOARD KEELS ARE 
 USED AS FAST SAILBOATS TO PROVIDE AN  
 EXCITING HOBBY FOR LOCAL MEN.         
  YOUNGER PEOPLE ARE BEGINNING TO      
 INTRODUCE SAILBOARDS. AS THESE ARE    
 READILY TRANSPORTABLE DAY VISITORS    
 OFTEN BRING THEIR BOARDS ON THEIR CARS
  USUALLY THESE ARE NOT GOOD SURFING   
 BEACHES BUT WITH THE ADVENT OF WET    
 SUITS WHICH PROTECT THE WEARER FROM   
 EXPOSURE,IT IS NOW POSSIBLE TO UTILISE
 THE WAVES PRODUCED IN THE AUTUMN AND  
 WINTER STORMS.THUS ON SUITABLE DAYS A 
 COLLECTION OF MALIBU BOARDS AND THEIR 
 JOCKEYS APPEAR TO RIDE THE SURF.      </content>
