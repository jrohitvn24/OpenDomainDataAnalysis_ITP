 farming in Hullavington are the herds 
 of cows that walk through The Street  
 twice a day.They come from Gardener's 
 and Lawn Farms &amp; are owned by Mr      
 Greenman and Mr Hawker.Mr Greenman has
 100 cows including young cattle.He    
 does not milk his cows anymore.Mr     
 Hawker has 450 cows altogether and    
 milks his cows twice a day at 4.15am  
 and again at 3.00pm.Mr Greenman has 5 
 different breeds of cows. These are   
 Simmental,Fresians,Herefords,Limousins
 and Charollais.Mr Hawker only has     
 Dutch Fresians.Mr Hawker's cows give  
 3000 litres of milk per day, which is 
 6.666 litres each.Mr Hawker has cows  
 for beef,dairy replacement &amp;          
 milking.One of the photographs shows
