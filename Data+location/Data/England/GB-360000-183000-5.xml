		<title>05COURT AND PARK FARMS</title>
		<content>  At the first farm the owners grow    
{barley}and keep{dairy cattle}with a   
 few beef cattle (kept for their       
 daughter).The{milk}is sold to the Milk
 Marketing Board, and they are not     
 allowed to produce as much as they    
 want to.                              
  The farm is 80 acres,and they rent   
 another farm at Itchington, which is  
 120 acres.They own tractors,fertiliser
 spreaders and combined harvesters, but
 they handle all bales by hand.        
  The owners feel that there is a      
 future in farming,and they will       
 continue to make a living from it.They
 do not have much help;it is more of a 
{family farm.                          
  At the second farm they have recently
 changed over to{crop farming}in the   
 main,rather than beef farming.        
  They have lived at the farm for 32   
 years,and the farm is 70 years old.   </content>
