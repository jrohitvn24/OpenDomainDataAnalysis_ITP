		<content>   The glass doors are jammed again, so
 I heave and pull, scraping them on the
 floor. The entrance is strewn with    
 rubbish, and has an unidentifiable    
 smell. At the lift I press the        
 button-clanking and buzzing, but no   
 sign of movement, so I head for the   
 stairs.                               
   On the third flight of urine-       
 stinking steps I have to wedge myself 
 against the wall as two sweating,     
 swearing men manhandle an un-         
 cooperative matress over the rail. The
 next floor up the lift door is jammed 
 open with a bag of golf clubs so that 
 the people next door can fill it with 
 furniture. They're moving today-lucky 
 beggars!                              
   Behind my own front door it's       
 comfortable, and quiet.
