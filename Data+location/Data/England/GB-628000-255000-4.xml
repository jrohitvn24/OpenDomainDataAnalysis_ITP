		<content>As part of our project we asked all the
Junior children in our school if they  
could tell us what their parents did   
for a living. We received l1l replies  
about Mothers and l09 about Fathers (  
2 children did not know what their     
Fathers did). We found that most       
mothers worked locally and were        
housewives, cleaners or health workers 
in homes for the elderley or mentally  
infirm. A few mums worked in the fields
for Mr. Holland the farmer or Notcutts 
Nursery.Most mums did jobs did jobs    
that fitted in with school hours. The  
jobs for fathers were more varied and  
they had to travel further away to get 
to work. The most common jobs were in  
the construction industry. Then came   
driving, agriculture/horticulture,     
and the electronic and computing       
industry i.e. high technology staff    
at British Telecom at Martlesham.      </content>
