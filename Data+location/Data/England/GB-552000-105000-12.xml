		<title>12Arlington Reservoir: ecology</title>
		<content>   The Reservoir is stocked annually   
 with Rainbow Trout.                   
   Anglers buy season tickets to fish  
 from April to October, catching a     
 maximum of 2 brace a day.             
   Other fish spawn has entered the    
 reservoir and now breeds naturally.   
   Coarse fish - roach, bream and perch
 - are not wanted in the reservoir and 
 are fished out regularly and put back 
 in the Cuckmere River.                
   During 1985 the fish have been      
 severely affected by the Ergasilus    
 parasite.                             
   Slow-growing trees have been        
 planted on parts of the bank. These   
 are not yet well established and look 
 like rough scrubland.                 
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
