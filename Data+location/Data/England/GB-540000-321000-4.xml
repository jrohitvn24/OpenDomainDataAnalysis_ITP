    "Churches generally do not only    
 support themselves but they also do   
 good work in the community, for       
 example the Baptist Church is         
 providing tea for all the old folks,  
 the people of the Silver Link Club.We 
 give money to other charities like    
 other churches do:to Christian Aid;   
 the missionary societies; Save the    
 Children Fund; Famine in Ethiopia:    
 this sort of thing. Last year our     
 church gave away over,Â£1,100 to other 
 charities, to other people and we have
 people from the church go round       
 sick-visiting and the carol singers   
 that go from the churches,they collect
 money and then use it to visit people 
 who are sick or living on their       
 own.Once a fortnight they give Â£1 each
 for the service."
