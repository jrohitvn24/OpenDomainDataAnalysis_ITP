		<title>16Bonfire Night at Smarden</title>
		<content> Each year Bonfire Night is celebrated 
 by a torchlight procession of floats  
 followed by a firework display. The   
 event is organised by the youth club  
 and teenagers carrying flaming torches
 lead the procession. Each float,      
 decorated by a village group or club, 
 is mounted on a lorry or trailer.     
 Prizes are awarded to the best floats.
 They are led by a band along the route
 from the Old Rectory to Doctor's      
 Corner and back to the Minnis. Crowds 
 line The Street and afterwards gather 
 round the bonfire, topped by a Guy, on
 Cornes Meadow. A firework display     
 follows, paid for by local donations, 
 and the money collected (Â£500 last    
 year) goes to youth club funds. Drinks
 and hot dogs are sold as children     
 dance round the bonfire, probably     
 unaware that they are celebrating the 
 death, long ago, of poor Guy Fawkes.  </content>
