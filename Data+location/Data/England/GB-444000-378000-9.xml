		<content> We went Eckington School in our       
 teacher's car because it is three and 
 half miles away from our village. All 
 the children in our village go here   
 when they leave the Junior School. We 
 talked to one boy and two girls. The  
 boy's favourite subject was Philosophy
 and when he left school he wanted to  
 be a teacher. His favourite sport was 
 football. The two girls both wanted to
 be engineers when they left school.   
 None of the three thought they stood  
 much chance of getting a job because  
 of the high unemployment. They didn't 
 like their School because they thought
 it didn't prepare them for life after 
 school. They also thought that there  
 were too many silly rules and that the
 teachers treated the children badly   
 and never listened to their points of 
 view. The biggest difficulty at school
 was catching the right bus.           </content>
