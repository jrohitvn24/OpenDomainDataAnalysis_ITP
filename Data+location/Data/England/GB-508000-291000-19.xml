		<title>19Religion in Elton</title>
		<content> Elton has an ancient parish church and
 a Methodist chapel.                   
 The church was founded in Saxon times,
 and small carvings from this period   
 remain in the north aisle and in      
 grave-yard crosses.The present church 
 dates mainly from the 14th century    
 with restoration in the late 19th and 
 early 20th centuries.                 
 The Rector who lives in the village   
 is also responsible for the parishes  
 of Stibbington and Water Newton.      
 The children of this school meet in   
 church on most Friday mornings for a  
 short service,and also attend two     
 School Eucharists each term,plus other
 special services.                     
 The Methodist chapel dates from 1864. 
 It has a handsome stone north front.  
 Some villagers travel to churches of  
 various denominations in nearby towns.
