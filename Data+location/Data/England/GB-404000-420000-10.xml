		<content> Another important recreational        
 facility is provided by the landscape 
 itself.{Hill walking}is an activity   
 which is enjoyed by young and old     
 alike.                                
                                       
 The{Calderdale Way}is a circular route
 of some fifty miles which was         
 established by local enthusiasts some 
 years ago. It travels around the whole
 of Calderdale, passing through many   
 places of beauty and interest. It     
 passes through this area, the path    
 rising uphill through Greetland,      
 across Norland Moor to Barkisland,    
 before descending again to Ripponden. 
                                       
 The area is criss-crossed with many   
 footpaths and bridleways, some of     
 which are of very ancient origin.     
                                       
                                       </content>
