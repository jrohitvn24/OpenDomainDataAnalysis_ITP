		<content>{THE SPORTSMAN }Public House is        
 situated on the main Ramsgate Sandwich
 Road. Most types of BITTER from  72p _
 96p a pint. Patrons can obtain fast   
 food meals and most of the custom     
 comes from passing traffic with a few 
 from the nearby village.              
 An interesting feature of the cellar  
 is the boarded up Victorian bread     
 oven. There are at least 17 tubs in   
 the cellar at any one time and about  
 300 barrels (9,000 gallons) are       
 consumed per year.                    
{MENU: }Ploughmans lunch Â£1.50p        
        Scampi and Chips Â£2.30p        
        Coffee              30p

 offered and there is a small          
 restaurant area and a few seats       
 outside which overlook Pegwell Bay.   
 There is a large carpark and a small
