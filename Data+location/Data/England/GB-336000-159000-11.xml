		<title>11Geoffrey Lives in Banwell</title>
		<content>    Around my house is a farm and my   
 garden is so big it looks like it is  
 my garden and someone else's. I       
 usually play by myself because no one 
 lives near me. I play tennis against  
 the wall and cricket with my dad. I   
 like to play tennis and cricket       
 because I want to do them when I grow 
 up.                                   
    I usually have cornflakes for      
 breakfast. I leave for school at      
 8.45am, I go by car. My favourite     
 school dinner is chips, fish and      
 tomatoes. I leave school at 3.30pm.   
 I watch the video, television or play 
 the piano before I go to bed.         
    I belong to cubs and the Tuesday   
 Club. I like going to them because we 
 play good games, and have quizzes and 
 prizes. I also like to see the cars   
 flashing past, most of the time the   
 cars sound like a tune from my piano. </content>
