		<title>17AN OLD LADY FROM TONBRIDGE:3</title>
		<content>  Grace Blaire was born in 1908,the    
 youngest of 4 brothers and a sister.As
 a girl she wore a frilled voile dress 
 or checked gingham in the summer and  
 kilts and jerseys in the winter.      
  Her mother made most of her clothes, 
 but some new clothes were bought for  
 birthdays and at Christmas.For special
 occasions she had a navy blue velvet  
 dress with a crotcheted collar and she
 had a coat with a fur collar and muff.
  Once a week a wash woman came,so     
 Grace's mother got up early and filled
 the copper with water.The woman would 
 stay all morning,washing,rinsing and  
 boiling,and would hang it out in the  
 garden to dry.At noon she would demand
 a cheese sandwich and a glass of beer.
  Grace is now Mrs Davison and she     
 lives in a very nice house in Speyside
 with her husband.They have 3 children 
 but do not see them very often.       </content>
