		<title>03Changes in Kirkby</title>
		<content>    Our class interviewed 100 people   
 about the changes there have been in  
 our town.   A lot of people said the  
{shopping precinct}had been built but  
 all the{railways}but one had been     
 closed down.                          
   {The Festival Hall}has been         
 repaired.   Three people mentioned    
 that Bentinck House had been knocked  
 down and in place houses had been     
 built by Rippon Homes.                
    Things have got busier in Kirkby,  
 with{traffic}getting heavier.   One   
 lady said "There only used to be a    
 pony and trap!"  There are more       
 factories and industrial{estates. }   
{Two schools}have been built recently; 
 one of them is Ashfield Comprehensive.
    {Leisure facilities}aren't so      
 common in Kirkby but new equipment was
 recently put up on Titchfield Park.
