		<content>  Our group did a survey of food. The  
 top 3 foods were chips with 54, curry 
 with 8 and sausages with 7. If you    
 would like to know how to make chips  
 you get a few potatoes and peel them. 
 When you have peeled them you have to 
 cut them into straight lines and then 
 you put them into the fat which should
 be hot because you have already put   
 the fat on to the oven.               
  I think that we are very lucky in    
 this country because we have a lot of 
 choice. In our survey (of 152         
 children) there were 62 different     
 favourite foods.                      
  Curry was brought over to us by      
 Indian immigrants in the last 30      
 years. Our grandparents would not have
 tried it but people in this country   
 have gradually got used to it and now 
 it is quite popular as shown by our   
 survey.                               </content>
