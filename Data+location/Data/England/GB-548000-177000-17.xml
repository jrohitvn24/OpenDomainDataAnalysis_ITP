		<title>17ERITH MARKET</title>
		<content>  I go to Erith Market nearly every    
 Saturday. The market sells a lot. It  
 sells fresh fruit, clothes, underwear 
 and bags and jewels mostly. I buy some
 of my clothes from the market. I      
 bought a flower power suit. Flower    
 power suits are like big pyjamas with 
 flowers on. This is the fashion. Also 
 shoes made out of plastic are in      
 fashion. Something which is in fashion
 for you hair is lace. It is like      
 netting with patterns on. The market  
 is a bit smelly. The ground always has
 rubbish on it. The market is held on  
 Wednesdays and Saturdays. You can get 
 chips from the market. These are very 
 hot.                                  
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
