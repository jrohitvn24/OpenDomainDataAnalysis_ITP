		<content>{ CHURCH OF ENGLAND:}For many centuries
 the entire area lay within the large  
 ecclesiastic parish of Great Budworth.
       The church at Lower Peover,     
 which also serves Plumley, was a      
 chapel of ease of Great Budworth from 
 the 13th century.  Some Pickmere      
 residents still travel to worship at  
 St.Mary's, Great Budworth. There is a 
 parish church (date 1845) at Lostock  
 Gralam, and services administered by  
 this parish are held at Wincham, in   
 the former primary school.            
{ ROMAN CATHOLIC:}The nearest Roman    
 Catholic churches are situated at     
 Knutsford and Northwich.              
{ METHODIST:}Pickmere (date 1826),     
 Lostock Green(1835) and Plumley(1887) 
 each have neat brick built Methodist  
 churches, all within the Northwich    
 Circuit, and Stoke on Trent District.
