		<title>16WEST MONKTON POST OFFICE.</title>
		<content>  The post office and general stores is
 a 300 year old house.A number of rooms
 are as they were when it was built.The
 original house is now 3 or 4 separate 
 houses.Inside,the doors can still be  
 traced.It was changed into a shop in  
 1948.The owners live above their shop.
 It is very cramped.One of the bedrooms
 is above next door's bathroom. Their  
 bathroom is built onto 1 of their bed-
 rooms. The corridors are crooked and  
 rather low.                           
  The old post office sorting room now 
 acts as a food store room.The post is 
 taken by van to Taunton to be sorted  
 by computer.                          
  Most of their customers are old.They 
 have 120 pensioners who are kind.They 
 sell mainly stationery and food. Most 
 of the villagers shop in supermarkets 
 in Taunton, so the village store acts 
 as an emergency supplier. _           </content>
