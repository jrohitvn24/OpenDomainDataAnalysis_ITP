		<title>19Road Safety in Thurlow</title>
		<content> The Borough Council is frequently     
 approached by the Parish Council about
 the upkeep of roadside footpaths,     
 safety rails on bridges and the repair
 of potholes in the road after the     
 winter. Reduction in council spending 
 would explain these problems and also 
 their reluctance to grit the roads in 
 winter and to provide a much needed   
 layby near the school to ease parents'
 parking problems ad the resulting     
 congestion and safety hazard. Many    
 drivers speed through the village     
 despite the 40mph signs at both ends  
 of the village and along the main     
 street, obtained after a dialogue with
 the Borough lasting several years.    
 Faulty and unreliable street lighting 
 causes continual concern.             
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
