		<title>05SOME OLD HOUSES IN THE AREA</title>
		<content> Natalie's house on Middle Hill, was   
 built in 1930 by Walter Wolsey. It is 
 semi detached of soft Norfolk brick,  
 made locally. It was used by the groom
 at the White House.                   
 Alexander says his house at Doctor's  
 Corner is the oldest in the village.It
 has seventeen rooms, a stable block   
 and one acre of land. The oldest part 
 is built of flint and altered in      
 Victorian times. It was a doctor's    
 House for 120 years. White's          
 'Norfolk'lists the owner in 1865 as   
 Thomas Prangley,surgeon. Then came    
 Dr. Spurrell, Dr. Barton and finally  
 Dr. Eddy. The house is now lived in by
 3 generations of Alexander's family.  
 His parents design and hand print     
 cards.                                
 James tells us in Wickmere the school 
 is now a private house owned by 2     
 musical ladies who give concerts.     </content>
