		<title>11Chew Valley Lake - Birds</title>
		<content>   Ever since the dam was completed in 
 1953 the 1200 acres of water have     
 proved a magnet for birds moving      
 through the area. This attraction is  
 sustained by the great length of      
 shallow, natural banks fringed by a   
 wealth of emergent plants, (including 
 the Country's largest reed-bed at the 
 Herriott's Bridge end). It has gained 
 "Site of Special Scientific Interest" 
 status largely due to the number of   
 ducks and grebes using the lake as a  
 feeding area. Surface feeders are     
 dominant although diving ducks are    
 also frequent. The water levels are   
 regulated so that in autumn a large   
 expanse of mud with shallow pools is  
 exposed. This encourages many passing 
 migrants to land and feed before going
 on. This is primarily when the        
 rarities occur and many birds usually 
 resident in America has been seen.    </content>
