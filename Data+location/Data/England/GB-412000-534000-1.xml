		<title>01Helme Park Nursery.</title>
		<content> We went to Helme Park which is a      
 nursery for young trees and shrubs.The
 man who showed us around was called   
 Mr. Jones. He told us the names of all
 the trees and made special notice of  
 some rarer trees.These included a red 
 leaf oak,Japanese poplar and Canadian 
 maple tree.Of the more common types   
 there were oak, sycamore, beech and   
 most other common trees.              
 Helme Park is run by the Northern     
 Forestry Products but the three men   
 who work there at present are going to
 be made redundant.The company are     
 going to sell the magnificent house   
 and out-buildings as well as the      
 grounds.                              
 It means that the trees and shrubs    
 will have to be sold and the men will 
 have to find new jobs which is very   
 difficult these days.
