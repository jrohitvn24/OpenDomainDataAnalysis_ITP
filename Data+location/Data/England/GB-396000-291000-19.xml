		<content> The pub that I live in is called "The 
 Tipton Arms". It is a very big pub, in
 fact it is the biggest in Tipton. The 
 pub has a lounge, function room,games 
 room and a bar.The bar is the busiest 
 room; it has the cheapest prices. The 
 games room is the busiest at the week 
 end.You can play pool, cards, dominoes
 and darts in the games room. In summer
 we have discos in the games room. We  
 have wedding and engagement parties   
 in the function room. Behind the pub  
 there is a garden. Normally in the    
 garden people sit around and have a   
 drink, but this summer (1985) we are  
 having an August Festival with a      
 football tournament, a barbeque, the  
 Highgate Brewery Band and a disco.
