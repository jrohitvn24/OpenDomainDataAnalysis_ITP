		<title>16CHILDREN'S LEISURE</title>
		<content>  In early spring, watching{television 
 (weekend average - 4 hours per day)   
 was the commonest leisure-time filler.
 On fine weekends this dropped         
 considerably as they played outdoors  
 with friends (most popular), went     
 family shopping or visited relatives  
 (although there was much breakfast    
 time viewing). Hobbies include        
{cricket, tennis and cycling. Brownie  
{meetings}and{camp}are popular.        
 Although one nine year old goes to bed
 soon after 19.30, the average bed time
 for nine to eleven year olds at       
 weekends is 22.00 with much late T.V. 
 viewing. For family{holidays,}3 out of
 26 go abroad to Europe, 1 to relatives
 in Ireland, 12 to resorts in this     
 country (popularly Devon and          
 Cornwall), 8 remain at home taking    
 day-trips, while two are undecided.
