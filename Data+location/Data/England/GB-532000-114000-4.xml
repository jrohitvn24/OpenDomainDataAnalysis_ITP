		<content> Questioning the children of           
 St.Margaret's C.E.Primary School      
 revealed interesting facts.The        
 majority of children were not born in 
 the village and few of their parents  
 work there,most commute to Brighton (5
 miles) or London (55 miles).Local     
 shops are not used for major purchases
 but most shopping was done in nearby  
 towns.Most families had annual        
 holidays often to exotic places       
 including West Africa, Tenerife and   
 Australia.Every family owned at least 
 one car and the majority had central  
 heating;only one house had solar      
 heating.The children do not regard the
 village as the centre for their       
 recreation.This emphasises the        
 considerable divide that exists in the
 population;The many well_to_do and    
 retired folk have little to do with   
 the school and enjoy the village life.</content>
