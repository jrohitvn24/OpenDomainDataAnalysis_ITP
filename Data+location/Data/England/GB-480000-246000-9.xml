Stocking Green Farm has 510 acres of   
mainly arable land,with 60 acres of    
grass land, dressed with nitrogen and  
farmyard manure from the cowsheds.     
Grass is cut for hay.wheat,oats and    
barley are grown,with 30 acres of high 
protein Tic beans. 50% of these are    
expoted to Egypt and Israel and the    
rest are fed into pigeon trays.No      
horticultural crops are grown as the   
soil is too heavy.Hares partridge ducks
and peewits can be seen. There is a    
large pond and a brook.The cattle are  
Herefords and Charolais,with 14 suckler
cows,and calves which are bought in and
reared until two years old.They run    
about 40 sheep. Pastureland is enclosed
by hedges,mainly hawthorn,and there are
a few ash trees. Several horses are    
kept. The motorway goes through the    
corner of one field.                   </content>
