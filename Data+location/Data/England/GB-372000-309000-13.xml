 Sheriffhales school has 3 classes. The
 desks are not in rows they are in     
 blocks. The teachers are not as strict
 they do not give you the cane anymore.
 It is banned. We have outside toilets 
 and a cloakroom for each class. The   
 Infant class is quite new it was built
 in 1968 and the Junior's class was    
 built in 1848. We have display boards 
 in the class and we display all our   
 work. We also do art. In our school we
 have a computer which you can learn on
 and do Maths.It is a BBC model 'B'.
