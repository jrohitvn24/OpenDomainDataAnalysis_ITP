 went to Newton Toney Post Office and  
 interviewed {Miss S.M.Albury.}The Post
 Office gets about 2 sacks of letters a
 day. She works from 9.00am to 12.00   
 noon then from 2.00pm to 5.30pm.  I   
 liked her very much.{Newton Toney     
{School}We went to Newton Toney School 
 to ask them some questions and we     
 interviewed a boy called{Sean}and he  
 lives in Cholderton.Their letters are 
 delivered at 9.00am but he does not   
 know who delivers their letters.{     
{Boscombe Post Office }We went to      
 Boscombe Post Office and interviewed {
{Mrs E.M.Wagg.}Each day they get about 
 4 sacks of letters. They have been    
 robbed once but did not catch him or  
 her. I thought she was very pleasant  
 and it was nice of her to give up her 
 time.
