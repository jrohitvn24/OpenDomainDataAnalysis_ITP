 At Berwick St.James School, in the    
 older class of twelve children, it    
 was found that between them their     
 families owned:                       
       19 cars                         
       6 motorbikes                    
       42 bicycles                     
                                       
                                       
 This need for an independent means of 
 transport is understandable when the  
 return bus fare to Salisbury (9 miles 
 away) is now Â£1.60 and there are only 
 five buses a day into the town with   
 nothing after 6 p.m. It is almost     
 impossible for teenagers to attend any
 evening event outside the village     
 without the help of their parents'    
 transport.
