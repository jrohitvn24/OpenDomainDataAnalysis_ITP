		<content> Public transport in this area is      
 very sparce and so residents have to  
 depend, in the main, on their own     
 cars, bicycles or legs.               
                                       
 There are a few public buses each day 
 that pass through the area on route   
 between Hereford and Kington and one  
 bus on Fridays that goes to           
 Leominster.                           
                                       
 If there are primary or secondary     
 school children living in the area    
 wishing to travel to Weobley or       
 Leominster, then a school bus will run
 round to collect and return them to a 
 point close to their homes.           
                                       
 Two private factory buses carry out   
 the same function for members for     
 staff.                                
                                       </content>
