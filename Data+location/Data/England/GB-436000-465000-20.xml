		<title>20The Recreation Ground</title>
		<content> The "Wreck" is the local recreation   
 ground in Boroughbridge.It is very    
 near to the High School,and the       
 Leisure Centre.It has a roundabout,   
 2 sets of wooden swings,a see-saw,    
 baby swings and a baby slide.At one   
 end there is a climbing frame.There   
 used to be a larger slide but it was  
 taken away.The Wreck is situated      
 between New Row and the old A.1.At the
 top of the Wreck there is lots of     
 space in which you can exercise your  
 dog.A fair comes to Boroughbridge     
 often,it is held at the Wreck.It is   
 the only park,but as Boroughbridge is 
 in the middle of the countryside other
 parks are not really necessary.The    
 children are also allowed to play on  
 the school playing field.Boroughbridge
 also has a cricket field,a tennis     
 club and a football club.
