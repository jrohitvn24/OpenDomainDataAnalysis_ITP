		<title>04Bredwardine; Population.</title>
		<content> Bredwardine and Brobury is an area of 
 scattered farms and cottages and very 
 small population. In 1985 there are   
 138 people on the Electoral Roll for  
 Bredwardine (of which about 20 live   
 outside  our area) and only 16 for    
 Brobury. There are about 25 children  
 under 16 in Bredwardine and only 6 in 
 Brobury. Bredwardine village has a    
 pub, a shop, a Post Office, a Guest   
 House, a farm, a Village Hall, a      
 terrace of 16 houses originally built 
 by South Herefordshire D.C. and now   
 mostly owner-occupied, and 5 Council  
 bungalows. These are all near the     
 cross-roads, and the rest of the      
 population lives in houses in farms   
 scattered along the lanes. Brobury has
 no shop or Post Office; the former    
 church is now a private house. Two of 
 the one-kilometre squares in our area 
 is not inhabited at all.              </content>
