		<title>07ST.HELIER HARBOUR</title>
		<content>   The harbour is vitally important    
 to the people of Jersey because most  
 of our needs: food, clothing, building
 materials, etc.  have to be imported. 
   The old harbour was probably for    
 fishing boats. The two main piers were
 named after Queen Victoria and Prince 
 Albert. Recent changes apart all piers
 including the New North Quay are 19thC
   The harbour is built of granite and 
 the entrance is only 160 feet wide.The
 tide rises from a minimum of 9 feet to
 a maximum of 50 feet, so ships cannot 
 always enter when they wish. At       
 present 35 acres of sea are being     
 reclaimed which will bring the total  
 harbour area to 145 acres.            
    There are over twenty arrivals     
 daily, including 5 mailboats carrying 
 as many as 6,000 people and roll      
 on-roll off freight. 350,000 tonnes of
 freight arrives every year.           </content>
