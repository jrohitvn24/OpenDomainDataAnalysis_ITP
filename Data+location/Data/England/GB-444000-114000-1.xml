 This area can be divided into two     
 distinct sections. The northern part, 
 above the motorway is mostly given    
 over to arable{farming}whilst the area
 to the south is mainly given over to  
{industry}and residential{housing.     
 The{population}density is far greater 
 in the southerly part of the area, and
 there is intense housing development  
 of both traditional and timber-framed 
 types eating into the remaining       
 agricultural land that is left.       
 To the west of the area is a large car
 factory and an international airport  
 serving the Southampton area.
