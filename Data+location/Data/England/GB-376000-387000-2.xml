		<content> THE CANAL THAT RUNS NEAR OUR SCHOOLIS 
 THE{BRIDGEWATER CANAL}MADE BY {JAMES  
{BRINDLEY.}THE CANAL IS NO LONGER USED 
 FOR CARRYING GOODS BECAUSE OF TRAINS  
 AND ROADS. THE CANAL IS ONLY USED BY  
 FISHERMEN AND PLEASURE BOATS. DOWN THE
 CANAL A BIT, THERE IS A BOATYARD BUT  
 NOW IT IS ONLY USED AS A MOORING      
 PLACE. FURTHER UP THE CANAL, THERE IS 
 AN AQUEDUCT OVER THE CANAL. IT HAS GOT
 TWO ARCHES AND IT IS THE ORIGINAL     
 BECAUDE IT HAS GOT A PLAQUE ON THE    
 SIDE, BUT IT IS SO RUSTY THAT YOU     
 CAN'T READ IT. THERE ARE A LOT OF     
 BOATS MOORED UP AND QUITE A FEW ARE   
 NARROW BOATS. UNDER THE BRIDGE THERE  
 ARE A LOT OF PLANTS IN THE CANAL AND  
 ON THE TOW PATH.NO-ONE GOES SWIMMING  
 IN THE CANAL.THERE ARE SOME FISH IN   
 THE CANAL,BUT NOT MANY.               
                        BEN WAITE
