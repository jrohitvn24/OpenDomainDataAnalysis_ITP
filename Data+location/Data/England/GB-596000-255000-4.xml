		<content>{Cereals}are the predominant crop.{Oil 
{seed rape, sugarbeet, dried peas}or   
{field beans}are fairly widely grown as
 break crops on most farms to avoid    
 continuous cereal production.         
 Livestock is generally unimportant in 
 this area. A{dairy herd}of 75 Jersey  
 cows produces milk which is collected 
 by tanker from a dairy at Sible       
 Hedingham. Milk and cream are also    
 sold at the door.There is a herd of 70
{beef cattle}bought as stores locally  
 or from S.Wales, fattened over winter,
 and sold at Bury St Edmunds auction   
 market.                               
 Whilst{pigs}are important in Suffolk  
 this area has only 2 fattening units  
 run to supplement income on small     
 farms. These are both under contract  
 to an animal feed company.            
 A single{apple orchard}of 10ha. is the
 only horticultural enterprise.        </content>
