		<content>   Most of the houses in and aroud{    
{Kemble}are made of{Cotswold}stone and 
 tiles. There are lots of farm cottages
 that were built for the workers who   
 used to work on the farms. Now the    
 cottages are being sold because there 
 are not as many farm workers as there 
 used to be. In{Poole Keynes}and{Kemble
 there are quite a few council houses  
 which were built between the wars.    
  The new houses have been built of {  
{Cotswold}stone or reconstituted stone 
 so that they fit in with the old      
 buildings. Most of the gardens are    
 surrounded by dry-stone walls which   
 are built and repaired by local       
 craftsmen.
