 barley, potatoes, oil-seed rape and a 
 few winter oats. Most farms make      
{silage}and although fields are        
 relatively small and do not require   
 large{machines,}most farmers have     
 their own combine harvester. There are
 4 dairy farms,{cattle}being chiefly   
 Friesian and Friesian-X. Milk is      
 collected by tanker.{Sheep}for
