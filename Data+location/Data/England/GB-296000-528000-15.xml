		<content> DEC is the{iron and steel}contracting 
 arm for the British Steel Corporation.
 Locally, it is known as 'Chapel Bank' 
 because of its close proximity to     
 Chapel Hill on which was built the    
 first church in Workington. DEC was   
 once a major{foundry}and{engineering  
 complex serving many parts of the     
 world. In the last decade the foundry 
 has been remodelled and the           
 engineering section scaled down,      
 resulting in a significant loss of    
 jobs.                                 
 Today, the works using Concast        
 Technology supplies castings for water
 treatment plants, slab cooling, roller
 tables and inspection equipment.      
 The engineering section construct     
{nuclear transportation flasks}for     
 carrying nuclear waste to and from    
 British Nuclear Fuels at Windscales in
 Cumbria.                              </content>
