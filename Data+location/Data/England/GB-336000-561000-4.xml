		<title>04Gala Day</title>
		<content>At Blackford Gala we have races like   
Egg and Spoon and Flat Race and the    
Sack Race . We have the Gala in the    
field beside the school. The Gala Day  
is organised by the Social Committee   
which was formed at the time of the    
Queen's Silver Jubilee and has         
continued to promote events in the     
community ever since. The day includes 
team games like 5-a-side football and  
Rounders. The teams include both       
children and adults both male and      
female. After the sports a Dance is    
held in the Marquee.
