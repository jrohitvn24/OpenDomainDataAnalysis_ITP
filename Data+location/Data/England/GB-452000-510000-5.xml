		<title>05S.Tanton Farm near Gt.Ayton</title>
		<content>  South Tanton Farm is on the banks of 
 the stream called the River Tame. It  
 belongs to the Fletcher family, though
 three other people help Mr. Fletcher  
 run the farm, which is 250 acres.They 
 have 207 Freisian cows and two horses 
 as well as seven tractors,three       
 ploughs, three power harrows, three   
 sub-soilers and one combine harvester.
 There is also a boiler, corn dryer,   
 barley mill, roller, and  a sprayer   
 and fertiliser. They have one dog and 
 four cats. The cattle are fed on grass
 potatoes and barley.                  
  Most of the cultivated area is under 
 barley, where small fields have been  
 combined to make large ones.The       
 presently fashionable crop of oilseed 
 rape is in one field. The farm house  
 is an 18th century listed building,   
 but most of the barns are much newer.
