		<title>08Wormleighton Passing of Time</title>
		<content> One tenant in the cottages in         
 Wormleighton was born and brought up  
 in the village. He is now retired and 
 gave us a picture of changes in       
 farming. Horses were used to draw     
 ploughs and the usual hours of        
 work per week were fifty in winter and
 fiftytwo in summer. Payment was ten   
 shillings per week plus threepence per
 hour overtime. Transport was limited  
 to cycling or walking in the village  
 but there was more public transport   
 than today. Buses went to Leamington  
 Spa and Banbury two days per week. Now
 the farmer can cope with one or two   
 workers and whereas a typical good    
 harvest was one ton now it is three or
 four tons for the same area. On many  
 farms corn is grown continuously with 
 weeds and disease controlled by       
 spraying often repeatedly.
