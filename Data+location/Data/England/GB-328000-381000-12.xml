		<title>12BARNSTON VILLAGE AND CHURCH</title>
		<content> Barnston Village has hardly changed in
 the last hundred years.               
   There a few large houses,some       
 picturesque cottages,a public house,  
 several farms along the A551 and of   
 course the village church             
 Christchurch.                         
   The church,which was a hundred years
 old in 1971,was built from the silvery
 red sandstone of nearby Storeton      
 Quarry in a "Gothic Revival"style.    
   The Day School,on the same site and 
 erected in 1870,was the village school
 for 80 years and is now the church    
 hall.                                 
   Our new Vicar lives in the vicarage 
 behind the Church.He came to Barnston 
 in 1984.He keeps his car in the       
 coachouse which used to hold horses   
 and carts.                            
   The Church,vicarage,old school and  
 coachouse were all built around 1871. </content>
