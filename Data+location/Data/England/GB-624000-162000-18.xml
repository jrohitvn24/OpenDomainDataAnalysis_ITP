 the end. Bad winters are followed by  
 good summers, droughts by wet autumns.

 towns folk think that we are monsters 
 destroying nature and ripping up the  
 landscape, but we live in it and love 
 it'.{Attitudes of Outsiders:'}They    
 think we lead an idyllic existance, a 
 slow quiet life. If they realised what
 effort we have to put into such things
 as taking the children to school, or  
 Granny to the docters'.               </content>
