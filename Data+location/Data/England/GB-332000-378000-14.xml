		<title>14THE DIBBINSDALE WOODS</title>
		<content>  In our block we have a varity of     
 wildlife-woodlands,the{Dibbin}        
 stream,farmland and a golf course.    
  The{Dibbin}is a stream which runs    
 through{Dibbinsdale Woods}.There is a 
 varity of wildlife in the woods       
 including plants,toadstools,animals   
 and birds.                            
  The{Dibbin}area is looked after by   
 wardens.They make sure that no-one    
 harms the wildlife.They are helped by 
 people on a{Youth Opportunities}      
{Scheme.}These people have made a      
 nature trail so that others can enjoy 
 the countryside without spoiling it.  
  The elm tree in our area is          
 endangered because of a beetle called 
 the{Dutch Elm Beetle.}The beetle lays 
 its eggs inside tunnels. It also      
 carries a fungus which clogs up the   
 sap and the tree dies.
