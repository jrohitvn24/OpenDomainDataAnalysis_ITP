		<title>11Lilley, Luton</title>
		<content> Lilley is a small rural village on the
 outskirts of Luton. On the A505 road  
 to Hitchin.  It is a linear form on   
 the dip slope of the Chiltern Hills   
 with a southerly aspect. The village  
 is a 'commuter suburb' providing a    
 rural environment for people working  
 in Luton, London and Hitchin. There is
 one shop, a barn of a local farm and  
 two public houses and a pond. The     
 church is the largest building in the 
 village. Rebuilt in the 1870's it     
 stands on the site of a twelfth       
 century building. The village is      
 surrounded on all sides by arable     
 land. It retains a strong farming     
 character despite the closeness of    
 Luton because of the three farms that 
 front the main street that is         
 effectively the only street of the    
 village.
