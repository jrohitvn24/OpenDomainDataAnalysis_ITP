		<title>01GENERAL INTRODUCTION: ERITH</title>
		<content> The area around Erith falls into four 
 main categories. The first,           
 residential occupies almost two-thirds
 of the area and reflects a wide       
 variety of housing; the second,       
 industrial, is mainly to the north,   
 along the river and giving work; the  
 third, the River Thames to the north  
 east, provides further jobs and       
 leisure opportunities; and finally,   
 the open ground of the Erith Marshes  
 to the north and Lesnes Park to the   
 west. These combine to give the area  
 its own particular character, which is
 enhanced by the multi-cultural nature 
 of its population. Within it are      
 people from all parts of Europe and   
 Asia, whose cultural heritage flavours
 this east of London region.           
 And so the following pages contain    
 many of our impressions of life in    
 Erith in 1985. Dip in and taste them. </content>
