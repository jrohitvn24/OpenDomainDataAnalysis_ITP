		<content> The area surrounding{Ewyas Harold}is  
{rural}and most of the land is{farmland
 but farming is certainly not the main 
 type of employment. Many people living
 in the area work in Hereford or other 
 places 10 miles or more away, using   
 the{A465,}Hereford to Abergavenny road
 link. About half of the working people
 in the area work locally but are not  
 involved in farming. Some of these    
 work on the small{industrial estate}at
{Pontrilas}or at Pontrilas Sawmills or 
 at Herbert Collins and Sons who make  
 farm buildings, trailers and          
 equipment, as well as selling cars and
 preparing rally and racing cars. A    
 number of people also work at the{SAS 
{camp}which is on the eastern edge of  
 the area.
