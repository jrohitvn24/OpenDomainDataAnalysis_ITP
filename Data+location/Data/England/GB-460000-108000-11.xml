		<title>11Survey of Southwick</title>
		<content> The survey showed that there is an    
 average of{2.8}people per house. The  
 male/female ratio is{lOO:lO9.}The     
 population is mostly elderly, but     
 shows evidence of a growing young     
 population. The oldest person has     
 lived in Southwick for 47 years and   
 the majority of people questioned have
 lived in Southwick for over l5 years. 
 The previous residence of the people  
 interviewed was mainly in the south of
 the county with many of these coming  
 from Naval ports. Nearly all of the   
 new houses are rented from the Council
 or from Mrs. Borthwick_Norton, many of
 these dwellings are between{2OO and   
{3OO years old.}The majority of the    
 inhabitants surveyed worked within the
 Southwick area and are able to walk to
 work.
