		<content> The Victorian railway station has been
 pulled down and very few trains now   
 arrive or depart. Fewer still are the 
 buses, making it difficult for        
 villagers with no other form of       
 transport to travel to other areas.   
   The village will be quieter when the
 new by-pass is completed. It will take
 many years to heal the scars to the   
 landscape and farm acres of 100 years 
 ago have vanished for the needs of    
 modern transport. But with the        
 re-opening of Buxworth Canal Basin it 
 is hoped to encourage more holiday    
 makers to the area.                   
   The village is still growing, with  
 new houses being built within the     
 village and on the outskirts between  
 Chinley and Chapel-en-le-Frith. The   
 new people in these houses will       
 hopefully merge with the rest.
