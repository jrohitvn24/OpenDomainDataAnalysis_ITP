		<content>   In{1977,Shell}took over the station 
 from City Petroleum. Since then, the  
 arrangement of its buildings has      
 changed 4 times. All of the electrical
 and computing systems now in use were 
 first installed 8 years ago. In the   
 near future, a diesel pump and more   
 petrol pumps are to be installed.     
   Each{tanker delivery}is worth       
 between Â£3500 and Â£4500, their fill-up
 point is at the rear of the station to
 avoid inconvenience for motorists.    
 Here, there are 5{underground tanks.  
 No.1 - 22,000l., No.2 - 11,500l.,     
 No.3 - 11,630l., No.4 - 22,000l.,  and
 No.5 - 14,000l.                       
   The site of the Cross Keys is a     
{prime site}for trade and attracts many
 regular customers. The Forge Garage in
 Upper Hagley is under the same        
 management, and provides service      
 facilities.                           </content>
