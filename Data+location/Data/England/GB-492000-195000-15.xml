		<title>15PENN WOODS</title>
		<content> Mr Tithecott came to talk to us about 
 Penn woods.He is Lord Howe's forester 
 and the father of Sam, who  is in our 
 class.You have to have 3 years        
 practical forestry and then take an   
 exam which includes biology and       
 entomology to be a forester.          
 Most of the trees in Penn Woods are   
 beech trees for the furniture trade.If
 beech is growing on chalky soil the   
 wood inside will be white,if it is    
 grown on clay it will be yellow. Beech
 trees take about 120 years to mature, 
 but conifers mature in 40-60 years so 
 quite a few are now being planted(the 
 ratio is 1/3 hardwood, 2/3 softwood). 
 The softwoods planted here are western
 hemlock,sica spruce,contorta pine,    
 Douglas fir and western red cedar.    
 The muntjac deer in these woods aren't
 a problem to saplings but grey        
 squirrels are.                        </content>
