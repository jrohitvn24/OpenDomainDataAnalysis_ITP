		<title>10Old Houses</title>
		<content>Several old houses remain as evidence  
of the local history. The Plough Inn   
has a piece of wattle and daub wall    
thought to be the oldest piece of      
domestic architecture in the parish.   
Near Trysull church a Tudor style      
house bears an insurance  company      
firemark. Above the Manor House door is
an inscription  dated 1633 saying:     
"Stranger should this catch your eye,  
do a favour passing by, bless this     
house ere you be gone, and it shall    
bless your passing on."  Other dated   
houses are Ketley House,1707, Mill     
House,Seisdon,1749.The old Stone House 
may have been the Hundred House where  
justice was handed out before the      
Manorial Court took over. Monkspath    
House is built on the path monks       
walked between White Ladies Priory,    
Brewood and Dudley Priory. In Ladywell 
Wood are ruins of the monks resthouse. </content>
