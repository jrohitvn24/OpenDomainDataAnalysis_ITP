		<title>17WHAT HAPPENS TO WASTE WATER</title>
		<content>    The processes used at Spalding     
 Treatment Works:                      
{Screening _}This removes large sticks 
 and rags etc.                         
{Grit Removal _}Removes sand and grit. 
 This is taken away and buried.        
{Settlement Tanks _}Large settleable   
 solids settle out to form a sludge    
 which is removed. The sludge is used  
 as a fertilizer on the land.          
{Biological Filtration Bed _}Bacteria  
 and microrganisims in the filter feed 
 on organic materials in the sewage and
 purify it.                            
{Humus Settlement Tanks _}Solids       
 settle out to form a sludge which is  
 removed. The water from the top of    
 these tanks is pumped into the        
 River.                                
    The buildings at Spalding have only
 a life of 30 years so they will not be
 there in thir present form in 50 years</content>
