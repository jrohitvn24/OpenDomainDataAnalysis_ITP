		<title>01DEVORAN AREA - GAZETTEER</title>
		<content> Our area is one of outstanding natural
 beauty.       It is rural and composed
 largely of agricultural land,pleasant-
 ly wooded. It includes three villages,
 Devoran, Perranwell Station and Carnon
 Downs.                                
  The  villages  contain  a  mixture of
 picturesque  cottages,  neat terraces,
 detached  houses  in  spacious grounds
 and new estates.                      
  There are  several  disused  quarries
 from which  the  local  building stone
 was once obtained.                    
  Part of the area, including the river
 was tin and copper mining country,  of
 which substantial traces remain.      
  A  British Rail  branch line  bisects
 the area,   as does the A39 from Truro
 to Falmouth.                          
  Cornwall  Bus &amp; Coachways  serve  the
 area,   as do a Travelling Library and
 mobile Fish &amp; Chip shop.  {           </content>
