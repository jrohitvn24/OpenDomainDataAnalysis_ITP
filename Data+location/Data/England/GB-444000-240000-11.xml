		<title>11A Day at School in Banbury</title>
		<content>  I get up in the morning. I have my   
breakfast. Then I leave for school at  
8.30a.m. and get to school at about    
8.35a.m.                               
  The bell goes at 9a.m. We go to our  
classroom and start to work. Sometimes 
we have an assembly.                   
  We work until 10.30a.m. and have a   
break. At 10.45a.m. we go in and work  
till 12 noon.                          
  We have an hour's dinner break. At   
12.30 school dinner children come out  
and "sandwiches" go in.                
  We start work again at 1p.m. and     
carry on working until 3p.m. Then we go
home.                                  
  Sometimes we have out-of-school      
activities.                            
  We play games like football or       
cricket at break.                      
                                       
                                       </content>
