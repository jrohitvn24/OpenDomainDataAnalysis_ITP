		<title>02Day in the life of a farmer.</title>
		<content>We talked to a farmer in the area. The 
farm is 198 acres mainly pasture. The  
farmer has got 170 cows. He gets up at 
6.00am.First thing in the morning he   
milks the cows,then he washes down the 
milking parlour &amp; machines. He turns   
the cows out of the field.             
  He has his breakfast at 9.30am and   
continues his work until lunchtime. He 
has lunch &amp; spends  the afternoon      
mowing and collecting the grass. At    
4.00pm he gets ready to milk the cows  
again, and  feeds the calves. He comes 
in at 7.00pm                           
  Other days he might spend his time   
repairing fencing or seeding.He enjoys 
his job and says nobody would farm who 
didn't enjoy it because it is a way of 
life. His wife helps him. His son works
with him &amp; he has one employee.
