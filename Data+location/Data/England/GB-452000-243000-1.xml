		<title>01The area around Sulgrave</title>
		<content>This area contains the villages of     
Thorpe Mandeville and Sulgrave with    
populations of 179 and 321             
respectively.                          
The land stands on a limestone belt    
stretching from Dorset to Whitby in    
Yorkshire.The ground undulates gently  
and the fields are large,surrounded by 
hedges.The source of the river Tow or  
Tove is to be found in the fields north
of Sulgrave.The only major road is the 
Banbury Lane running between Banbury   
and Northampton.                       
The majority of houses in both villages
are built of stone,the oldest ones with
undressed stone quarried in nearby     
Helmdon.Today the only building taking 
place is infilling on small plots of   
land or the conversion of old farm     
buildings into residential             
accommodation.Employment,in general,   
has to be found outside the area.      </content>
