		<content>Mr.and Mrs.Massey have lived at        
Strongford House for about 12 to 15    
years.The house was built in 1819.The  
land owned by Mr.and Mrs.Massey is 1   
acre and 1 tenth in size. In the       
olden days they brought flint on barges
up the River Trent.They weighed them in
the corner of the garden and took them 
on a horse and cart up the road to the 
pottery industries.Mr.Massey said      
that if you dug there you would find a 
lot of flint balls.There is a well in  
one of the outbuildings.There used to  
be a pump and the water was pumped     
onto the garden. The house was built   
by the Duke of Sutherland as part of   
his Trentham estate. It was then lived 
in by the manager of Strongford Sewage 
Works until it was bought by Mr.and    
Mrs.Massey. It is very modern inside.  
The house has three bedrooms.
