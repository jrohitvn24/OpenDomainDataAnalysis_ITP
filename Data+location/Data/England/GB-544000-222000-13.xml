		<title>13LOCAL FARMS</title>
		<content>     The local farms are highly        
 mechanised with a large capital       
 investment in machinery and buildings 
 most of which is very specialised. As 
 a result the workforce has steadily   
 declined and today it is normal for a 
 180 heactare farm to have around 3 - 4
 farmworkers in addition to the owner  
 or manager. A number of farms are     
 owned by firms and land use may be    
 co-ordinated across the group.        
    Today there are very few animals   
 kept outside in the fields; on        
 Churchend Farm cattle are kept in     
 stalls and fed on special feedstuffs. 
 After fattening they are sold at the  
 market for beef. Other farms such as  
 Wickham Hall keep cattle outside and  
 sometimes some sheep. The latter are  
 also kept on the School estate by the 
 boarding department.
