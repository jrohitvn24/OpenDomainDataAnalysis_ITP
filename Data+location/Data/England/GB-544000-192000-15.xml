		<title>15MANOR HALL</title>
		<content>   Manor Hall is a banqueting hall,    
 where people can book a table for     
 lunch or supper. This information goes
 into a diary.You have to fill in a    
 form which asks what your name and    
 address is.                           
                                       
   They ask what kind of luncheon and  
 also which hall you want. There are   
 two halls, one big  and one small.    
 They also ask what date you want it on
 and your phone number.  Our group ate 
 a 3 course meal.  A complete luncheon 
 which is a 4 course meal would cost   
 Â£8.60 per person.                     
                                       
   For a lunch of 30 they have to have 
 1 chef,2 waitresses,and one washing up
 man or woman.                         
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
