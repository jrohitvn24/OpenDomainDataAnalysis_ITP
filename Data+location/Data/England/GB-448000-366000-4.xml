		<content> In Scarcliffe Village there is a      
 church .It is called St. Leonards     
 Church.Outside in the graveyard the   
 paths were made of gravestones.The    
 church was built in 1150.Inside the   
 church it smelled damp and fusty.It   
 had central heating but of the        
 old_fashioned type.It had four arches 
 and three pillars.The font was about a
 metre long.Then we went up to the     
 altar .On one side there were twelve  
 pews and on the other side thirteen   
 pews.There was a tomb of Lady         
 Constantia who has been buried there  
 for seven hundred years.The bells are 
 rung in her memory every year for     
 three weeks on each side of Christmas.
