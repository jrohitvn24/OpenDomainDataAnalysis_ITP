		<content>  The area is predominantly flat and   
 open arable land. Most of the land    
 lies a few metres above the 61 meter  
 countour line. Soil heavy, fertile and
 is drained through clay and plastic   
 pipe into the ditches.  A lot of      
 hedges and trees have been grubbed out
 tomake larger fields. These often come
 to the edge of the roads. Many ditches
 still have hedges and trees along     
 them. There ae also spinneys and small
 woods. New trees and hedges are being 
 planted.                              
 The area is totally agricultural and  
 many residents are engaged in farming 
 and its service industries. People    
 however with  no connection with      
 agriculture now live in the area and  
 many of them work in Bury St Edmunds. 
                                       
 The hamlets have few amenities, though
 they have had new houses added to them</content>
