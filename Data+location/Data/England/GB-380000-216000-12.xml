		<title>12THE CATHEDRAL CLOSE</title>
		<content> THE CATHEDRAL CLOSE GREW UP ROUND THE 
 CATHEDRAL. THE OLDEST BUILDINGS DATE  
 FROM TUDOR TIMES BUT MOST BUILDINGS   
 WERE RESTORED DURING VICTORIA'S REIGN 
 ALTHOUGH THERE IS A FINE EXAMPLE OF   
 GEORGIAN ARCHITECTURE AT NUMBER 9 THE 
 CLOSE.                                
 ALMONERS HOUSE AND THE "POOR WINDOW"  
 WHERE ALMS WERE DISTRIBUTED IS STILL  
 VISIBLE.                              
 A WALL DIVIDED THE UPPER 1-4 AND      
 LOWER 6-14 POINTS OF THE CLOSE UNTIL  
 THE 18TH CENTURY.                     
 THE UPPER PART WAS A CEMETERY FOR     
 LAY-PEOPLE UNTIL THE 18TH CENTURY, IT 
 IS NOW USED AS A CAR PARK.            
 NUMBER 8 WAS ORIGINALLY THE MONASTIC  
 GUEST HOUSE, THE 15TH CENTURY HALL    
 REMAINS BEHIND THE GEORGIAN FRONTAGE.
