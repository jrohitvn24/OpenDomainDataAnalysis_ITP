		<content>   The income for the farm comes from  
 livestock.                            
                                       
   PIGS  There are 47 pedigree pigs    
                                       
   CATTLE The farmer used to keep 45 to
 50 cows but now keeps only 3. They    
 were Fresians and Herefords.          
                                       
   SHEEP The farmer keeps 47 sheep     
 which graze on the rough pasture.     
                                       
   The farmer sells his animals to be  
 slaughtered. He uses the markets at   
 Wetherby and Haslingden for selling   
 and he buys stock at Wetherby.        
                                       
  He also keeps a sheepdog which he    
 trained himself.
