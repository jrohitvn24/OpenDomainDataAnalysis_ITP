		<title>15TRANSPORT IN FRILSHAM</title>
		<content> If you live in Frilsham it is         
 essential to have a{bicycle or a car} 
 or to know a friendly car owner. There
 is{one bus}which runs on Thursday from
 the telephone box at Frilsham to      
 Newbury staying in town for 2 hours.  
 On this bus there is a voluntary      
 "welcome aboard" scheme to help the   
 elderly.{No trains.}The{M4 motorway } 
 forms the northern boundary of the    
 area and there is no access from      
 Frilsham. The two{main roads}run N-S  
 and E-W. They cross at the village of 
 Frilsham. These are unclassified      
 roads. Other{minor roads}run between  
 the large houses and the farms which  
 were once estate roads and now        
 maintained by Newbury District        
 Council. They are narrow but cars can 
 pass. Severe winter conditions in 1985
 made these roads impassable and       
 villages were cut off for a few days. </content>
