		<content> Our area is very rural.It contains the
 parish churches of St.Michael'at      
 Cheriton,All Saint's at Hinton Ampner 
 and St.Andrew's at Kilmeston.         
        It is high down country,chalk  
 and clay,sloping towards the village  
 of Cheriton which lies in the river   
 valley of the River Itchen, the source
 of which is just south of the village.
        Cheriton is a well kept village
 that has won the Best Kept Village in 
 Hampshire award on several occasions. 
        There are many thatched and    
 half timbered cottages in the area and
 much flint work can be seen.          
        Farming is mixed,wheat and     
 barley being the main crops, with     
 dairy herds,beef cattle and sheep.
