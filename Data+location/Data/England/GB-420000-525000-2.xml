		<content> The {Coach}House was built in 1825.   
 Recently it has been restored with    
 the aid of grants from{Sedgefield     
{District Council}, and is now used    
 as                                    
 a{Community}Centre.Although all of the
 rooms are small, many activities take 
 place throughout the day and during   
 the evening. These activities include 
 soft toy making, 'proddy mat' making  
 (which is a old art of rug making     
 common in the North East in days gone 
 by when floor coverings were made by  
 'prodding' short pieces of material   
 through a hesian backing),sketching,  
 art, wine making as well as activities
 for the young. The Centre has a leader
 who is assisted by 3 part time        
 teachers.Environmental trails of      
 Shildon have been devised by the staff
 of the centre,and are used by all of  
 the Primary schools in the town.      </content>
