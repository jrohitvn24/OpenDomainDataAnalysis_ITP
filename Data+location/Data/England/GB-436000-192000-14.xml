		<title>14Proposed sale of old school</title>
		<content>The local school was originally endowed
and presented to the village in 1871,  
but was closed in 1981. Children now   
attend either Junior School in West    
Hanney or secondary school in Wantage. 
The sale of the school building is now 
causing some controversy. The Church &amp; 
the village both feel that they have a 
legitimate claim to the proceeds. The  
Diocesan Council of Education &amp;        
Training plan to sell the school. The  
Parish has applied for a 3/14ths share 
to be divided with Lyford. It is       
uncertain whether the Church is        
entitled in law to this share, but the 
proceeds will have to be used for      
educational purposes in the Parish. It 
could not be used towards church       
repairs or to boost the Restoration    
Fund. There is much interest in        
purchasing the building for use as a   
Community Centre.                      </content>
