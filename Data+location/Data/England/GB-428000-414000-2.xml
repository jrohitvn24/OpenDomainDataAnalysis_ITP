		<title>02Typical Day Of A Teenager</title>
		<content> My name's Trudi Ward, I'm thirteen and
 I live in Hall Green, near Wakefield. 
 I'm woken by music blasting every     
 morning. I get washed, teeth brushed  
 and dressed. Then I have breakfast,   
 gather the days kit and put it in my  
 bag before setting out in coat and    
 shoes. After calling at my friend's   
 house Cath and I go to the            
 newsagent's. When the whistle's blown 
 the school playground is cleared of   
 children. We have four lessons a day  
 with breaks after each lesson. We     
 leave school at 3:40p.m. and go home. 
 At home I get changed into jodhpurs   
 and set of to see Polo,my pony.       
 I catch her and give her an apple as a
 titbit. Then I give her a good brush  
 and tack her up. Polo and I go out for
 a good ride and I bring her back.     
 After that I have some tea,do my      
 homework,have a bath and go to bed.   </content>
