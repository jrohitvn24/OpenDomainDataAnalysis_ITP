		<title>12CUBS OF LONG ASHTON</title>
		<content> The Long Ashton 'Lion' Cub pack meets 
 every Thursday in the Scout Hut in    
 Providence Lane. The leader is Mr D.  
 Tuckfield, and his son, Steve, helps. 
 The other leaders are Andy, Linda and 
 Richard. There used to be two Cub     
 packs in Long Ashton, but now they    
 have merged. The Cubs go on a day trip
 every year and also on Camp for a     
 week. In the summer they go to the    
 nearby Canyon, where they play        
 adventure games over a wide area.     
 Usually there are war games or hunting
 for sweets. They also cook over fires.
 The pack's day trips are usually quite
 a distance from Long Ashton, like to  
 Wembley or Yeovil. The leaders try to 
 make things fun. For example, soon    
 there will be a Dads versus Cubs      
 soccer match, and also Family         
 Rounders. The leaders' hard work is   
 appreciated by most parents           </content>
