		<title>16    Attitudes Con't</title>
		<content> The choice of schools is an obvious   
 reflection of the parents view of the 
 educational system.                   
 When asked about attitudes concerning 
 cigarettes, drink and drug abuse, we  
 found them to be very varied          
 indeed.Cigarettes proved to be very   
 anti-social with only two people      
 actually admitting they smoke         
 themselves. We found it quite amusing 
 when we asked one person about her    
 views on cigarettes, her answer was   
 they were disgusting, yet she stood at
 the door busily smoking a cigarette   
 herself ! Drink was quite acceptable  
 within moderation. Drugs, however,    
 proved to be viewed rather            
 differently. We had all sorts of weird
 and wonderful answers but on the      
 whole, they all said no.
