		<content>     {Skreens Park Farm}is a little way
 up from Cooley Spring. It is an arable
 and an animal farm. The Farmer has    
 five friesians and one aquitaine. He  
 usually has about 50 cows per year    
 , fattens them up and sends them to a 
 slaughter house to be killed and used 
 for beef. Inside a small room there   
 were 206{turkey chicks}being fattened}
 for Christmas Dinners. There was      
 a wooden surround with sawdust on the 
 floor and containers of pellets and   
 water. There were electric bulbs above
 a dome shape for heat and light.      
      Outside we saw a sort of cage    
 known as a cattle crush, used for     
 restraining the cows whilst giving    
 them injections and ear tags.         
      Crops grown : 92 acres wheat,    
 23 acres rape, 15 acres potatoes,     
 10 acres Spring Beans.                
                                       </content>
