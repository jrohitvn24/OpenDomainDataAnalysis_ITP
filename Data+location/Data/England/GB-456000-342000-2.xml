		<title>02BRICKYARD AT THORNEYWOOD</title>
		<content> Thorneywood is the area around my     
 school.In 1068 it was just a thorny   
 wood-part of Sherwood Forest.Later the
 king's red and fallow deer were kept  
 there.Fire and the enclosures act of  
 1797 reduced the woods and destroyed  
 the deer.For a long time the area was 
 open cultivated fields.Later still a  
 brickworks was established and existed
 until the mid-1960's.By 1919 many     
 houses were being built and people had
 more facilities.1967 brought the last 
 major change.A bungalow estate brought
 back memories for those who had played
 on the football pitch that was the    
 site.A friendly community came and    
 stayed in 1973,and the area is now    
 completely residential.Life centres on
 the homes,shops and pub.Everyone      
 receives a cheery welcome in the      
 shops,even if they are strangers.
