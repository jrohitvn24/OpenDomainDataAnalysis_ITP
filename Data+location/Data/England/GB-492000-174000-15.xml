		<content>{   What is the best age to change     
{schools?}Nobody around this area seems
 to know.                              
    In Windsor we change at 9 and 13,  
 but 3 miles away in Slough, it happens
 at 8 and 12. In Maidenhead, pupils    
 change schools at 11. This all happens
 in the same county.                   
    More confusing still, we had a     
 boys' and a girls' grammar school in  
 Windsor until 10 years ago. Now all   
 schools are comprehensive. In Slough, 
 there are still grammar schools and   
 secondary modern schools. Some parents
 who live in Slough want their child to
 come to Windsor whilst some Windsor   
 parents prefer  Slough.               
    Some schools are closing due to the
 fall in the birthrate. In 1981 there  
 were 5509 pupils in Windsor schools   
 and by 1991 there will be only 4512.
