		<title>18LEOMINSTER BY-PASS</title>
		<content>{Leominster}lies on the busy A49 trunk 
 road which takes heavy traffic between
 the Manchester area and South         
 Wales. The proposed by-pass is planned
 to pass to the east of{Leominster,    
 starting near the level crossing to   
 the north-east of the town.           
 For most of its length it runs        
 parallel with the railway and so      
 avoids cutting farmers off from their 
 fields. The road will be 7 metres wide
 and will be 7 kilometres long. It     
 joins the A49 again at Cadbury's      
 factory to the South of{Leominster. } 
 It is estimated that the road will    
 cost between 5 and 6 million pounds   
 and will take about two years to      
 build. Unfortunately{Leominster       
 football team will lose their ground  
 if it is built.
