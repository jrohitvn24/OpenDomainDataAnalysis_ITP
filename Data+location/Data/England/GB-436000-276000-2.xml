		<content> Binley is an old mining area. Many of 
 the houses on the new estate of       
 Ernesford Grange are built on the old 
 mine site. Binley is still often      
 referred to as Binley Village and     
 Abbey Cottages on the main road are   
 well known as mining cottages. Even   
 new enterprises still retain old      
 links. When a new post-office opened  
 recently along Quorn Way it was named 
 Binley Colliery Village Post Office   
 even though the mine had long been    
 closed. When a new pub opened about   
 six years ago it looked to local      
 history not only for its name but for 
 its decor and was called "The Iron    
 Man" and features along its walls     
 photographs of miners digging for     
 coal.  Roads on the new council estate
 are named after miners and many of    
 these names are to be found on the    
 gravestones in St. Bartholomews Church</content>
