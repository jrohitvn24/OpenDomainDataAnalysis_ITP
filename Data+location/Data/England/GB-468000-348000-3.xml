		<title>03SITE OF THURGARTON, NOTTS.</title>
		<content>   {Thurgarton}is a compact village of 
 400 people sited on the N.W. edge of  
 the{Trent Valley}where a small stream 
 has cut a subsequent valley through   
 the steepish hillside from the lightly
 rolling land above. Although there has
 been some ribbon development on the   
 road to{Bleasby}the up-market private 
 estate consolidates the aforementioned
 compactness.                          
   The site of the village, in a small 
 curve in the hillside ,and with its   
 Beck tumbling through ,is very        
 pleasing. No wonder the monks chose   
 this spot to build their{Priory}which 
 rivalled in size that of Southwell    
 four miles away to the north. There   
 is a beautiful view of the Dumble     
 and Priory from the hillside to the   
 south.On the main road in the village 
 centre are two pubs,one a well known  
 restaurant,and the little shop/P.O.   </content>
