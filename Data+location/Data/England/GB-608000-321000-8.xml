		<content> Whitwell Hall was built in 1750 but   
 in 1840 it was enlarged.The Hall has a
 flat inside.It is also used as a      
 conference centre.There are camps for 
 children in the summer.During term    
 time schools go for a week.They do    
 canoeing and other exciting things.   
 In the winter they have pottery       
 classes.                              
 Going through the grounds is a river. 
 On the river there was a tannary.When 
 the leather was ready it was sent from
 Whitwell station into Norwich to be   
 made into shoes.There are a lot of    
 lime and gravel pits which are now    
 used as farm dumps.Grazing land has   
 been converted into a tree plantation.
 They have an old ice house in the     
 grounds which was used for keeping    
 food fresh.There have been excavations
 of the old Whitwell village in the    
 grounds.                              </content>
