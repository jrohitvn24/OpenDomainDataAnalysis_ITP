		<content> We have been allocated three villages,
{(Stoke Poges,Farnham Common and       
{Fulmer)}and their surrounding areas to
 survey. These villages lie only twenty
 miles from London.                    
   Our impression of the area as a     
 whole is that is quite flat with some 
 wooded parts. Is is very{built up}    
 though it does not have a lot of      
 shops.                                
   Pockets within the area still retain
 the{natural landscape}which have not  
 been interfered with by housing       
 planners. There is still some woodland
 and open spaces which have not changed
 for hundreds of years.                
   The combination of open spaces,easy 
 access to Heathrow Airport and nearby 
 Motorways make the area attractive to{
{Commuters}.
