{flat,undulating and hilly.}The highest
 view point is 183m at co_ordinates    
 10,28. The highest farmed point is at 
 150m.The soil is crumbly and{chalky.} 
 Most of the land is owned by the      
 Hexton Manor Estate which belongs to  
 the Ashley_Cooper family who farm most
 of it. Some land is worked by tenant  
 farmers at Mortgrove and Barton Hill  
 Farms. A small area is owned by the   
 Crown and worked by Pond Farm.{Barley 
 and{wheat}are the main crops.{Rape,   
{peas}and{beans}are also grown. Barley 
 is grown for malting and animal feed; 
 wheat is grown for flour which is     
 particularly made into biscuits, and  
 for animal feed. Beans feed pigeons   
 and animals. Peas are tinned for      
 people to eat and are also used for   
 animal feed. Rape produces food oil.
