		<title>20Seghill</title>
		<content> The{population}of Seghill is now 1 760
 adults and 450 children. The old      
 village, linear in shape, is now      
 expanding to include private          
 developments. However many residents, 
 particularly the young,feel that there
 are few{facilities}for recreation. A  
 group of unemployed youngsters have   
 set up their own youth club in a      
 hut.It is open to anyone aged between 
 4 and 19 years, and although it may   
 not look much, it is seen as a way of 
 keeping off the streets and out of    
 trouble. The Institute, which is a    
 social centre, caters mainly for      
 adults, old people in particular,     
 providing Bingo, Whist drives etc.
