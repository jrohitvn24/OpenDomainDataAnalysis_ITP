		<content>   There are usually two or three      
 generations on one farm.The old       
 farmhouses are large enough to be     
 converted into what is locally known  
 as "parted houses",or the old         
 outbuildings may be transformed into  
 modern homes,or a new bungalow may be 
 built alongside the main farm;so that 
 the growing family group remains      
 intact,with the grandparents handy to 
 assist with the farm or domestic      
 crises.                               
   The newcomers have been generally   
 received in tolerant and kindly       
 fashion,provided they are prepared to 
 contribute to the life of the         
 community.There is,however,occasional 
 resentment if any attempt at "taking  
 over"is suspected!
