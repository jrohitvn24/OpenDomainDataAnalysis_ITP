		<content>{A Visit to the Local Library          
                                       
 We went to Cleckheaton Library and    
 interviewed a librarian called Miss   
 Roberts.She works about 37 hours a    
 week,from 9 o clock in a morning      
 sometimes till 7 o clock at night,    
 Monday to Friday,and looks after the  
 reference library and local           
 history.While we were there we saw a  
 map about 270 years old.We also found 
 out that the Cleckheaton Advertiser   
 was last printed about 50 years       
 ago.We looked at original papers as   
 well as microfilm records.We saw a    
 Spenborough Guardian from the year    
 1967 and a newspaper about 100 years  
 old in which the writing was sqashed  
 up.The Spenborough Guardian started in
 1867 and cost 1d.We also found out    
 that there used to be a station where 
 Hillards supermarket is now.          </content>
