		<content> The information contained within these
 pages was compiled by the pupils &amp;    
 staff of Hullavington Primary School  
 during the Summer of 1985.            
  To decide the catagories of Land     
 Cover most of the ground within the   
 the area was walked over or examined  
 from the roadside.                    
  Visits were made to the local R.A.F. 
 Station, farms and other interesting  
 places. Surveys were made, either by  
 questionnaires within the school, or  
 by counting items outside. The        
 telephone was used to ask questions of
 more distant people.                  
  This survey marked the first attempt 
 at the school to use a micro-computer 
 for information storage.              
  The staff involved were Graham Priest
 (Headmaster), Judith Sexton (Deputy   
 Head), Ann Sneyd, John Lewis, Susan   
 Fenner &amp; Janice Courts (Secretary).   </content>
