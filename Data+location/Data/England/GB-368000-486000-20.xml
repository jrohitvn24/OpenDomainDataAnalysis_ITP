		<title>20Needs For The Future Of Dent</title>
		<content>  Interviewing local inhabitants, and  
 discussing the future of life in this 
 dale proved to be most interesting.   
  Adults and children see the need for 
 some local Leisure Centre with a      
 swimming pool,badminton and squash    
 courts,B.M.X.track,and general safe   
 play area.The building design should  
 blend in with the dale,so as not to   
 spoil the scenery,even underground.   
   A few more shops would be welcome   
 like a clothing shop and bakers,and   
 more homes at a reasonable price for  
 local young couples.                  
    People would also like to have a   
 policeman in the village again.       
    On the whole most inhabitants are  
 satisfied with life as it is in Dent, 
 although the elderly find the journey 
 to hospital a worry as it can take the
 best part of a day.Fortunately people 
 in the area are reasonably healthy.   </content>
