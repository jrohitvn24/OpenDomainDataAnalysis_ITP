		<title>04Local customs</title>
		<content> Many old customs have died out, but   
 some remain and are as popular and    
 well supported as they used to be. The
 harvest festival is well attended and 
 this is usually followed, a day or so 
 later, by the harvest supper. These   
 are attended by many people who are   
 not normally church goers, and the    
 auction of harvest produce at the end 
 of the evening is a very happy time.  
 This auction helps to raise much      
 needed funds for the upkeep of the    
 church.  When there is a death most   
 people attend the funeral as a sign of
 respect for the deceased and sympathy 
 for the bereaved family.  Most        
 funerals are reported in the local    
 press, with a full list of names of   
 those who attended.
