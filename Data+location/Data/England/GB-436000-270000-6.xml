		<content> Shrubs Lodge is south east of         
 BUBBENHALL.The farmer is Mr.Smith.He  
 has been there for thirty years.Before
 they lived there the land was used for
 a Rough Shoot.He is an arable farmer  
 with a few chickens.He owns 5 fields  
 and 2 woods.Shrubs wood is a Site of  
 Scientific Interest,and with          
 Burnthurst Wood covers some 45 acres. 
 He rents 12 acres and grows potatoes  
 for the market.His 2 most expensive   
 pieces of machinery are his potato and
 combine harvester.Mr.Smith gets his   
 water from a well,but he is having to 
 monitor it everyday,because the Land  
 fill site next door is altering the   
 level of the Watertable of the        
 surrounding land.The Ecology of this  
 area is rich in Flora and Fauna and   
 Mr.Smith has many restrictions on the 
 use of his woods.
