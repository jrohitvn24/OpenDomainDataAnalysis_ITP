		<title>04A TYPICAL SCHOOL DAY</title>
		<content>   School starts at 8:50. We then have 
 registration for half an hour in our  
 form rooms. The register is taken and 
 two times a week we have assembly in  
 the hall. If we don't have assembly,  
 we just sit talking quietly or some of
 us do our homework. At 9:20 the first 
 lesson begins.                        
   After the first two lessons we have 
 a break that starts at 10:40 and      
 finishes at 11:00. We then have two   
 more lessons and they bring us up to  
 12:20. Then we can either eat         
 sandwiches that we have brought or    
 queue up and buy chips (25p or 45p)   
 from the fish and chip van. We then   
 have three more lessons until 3:25    
 which is end of school.
