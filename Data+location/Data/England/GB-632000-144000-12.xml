		<title>12ST MARGARETS HIGH STREET</title>
		<content> The village High Street is the major  
 shopping centre between Dover and     
 Deal. There are 13 shops lining both  
 sides of the road comprising; 1 bank,1
 post office,1 estate agent,2 news     
 agents,2 gift shops,1 florist,3 food  
 stores,1 greengrocers and 1 butcher.  
 These shops are good enough to provide
 1 in 7 families with most of their    
 weekly needs. Of the rest 60% shop in 
 Dover,and 30% in Deal. There are also 
 2 petrol stations and 5 pubs. Most    
 villagers are happy with their shops  
 but some would like a supermarket and 
 a small number want a chip shop. The  
 appeal of such development is not     
 universal. Many people drive to the   
 village shops and this with the       
 passage of Bay traffic has led to a   
 problem. A Saturday morning survey    
 counted 450 per hour passing the Post 
 Office.                               </content>
