		<title>05A day in the life of my Dad</title>
		<content> My dad is a lorry driver and          
 mechanic.He has to get up at 6 o'clock
 in the morning when he is working.He  
 goes down to the yard to see his boss 
 who will then tell him whether he     
 wants him driving or mending one of   
 the lorries.He goes to one of the     
 trucks(Daf 3800)and checks over the   
 engine,water oil and diesel.He then   
 gets out his maps and plans his       
 route.By 7.30 he is on the road and   
 will have a rest break after about 4  
 hours.After delivering his load the   
 lorry is loaded up again.Dad tries to 
  get a delivery near to the yard so   
 that he can come home.When he does get
 home he is very tired.                
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
