		<title>01"Metheringham Village Lincs"</title>
		<content> Metheringham is a large rural village 
 9 miles South-East of Lincoln and 9   
 miles North of Sleaford. The village  
 had a large area of cultivated land   
 supporting several hundred people in  
 1086. The present population is 2950. 
 Only a small percentage of the people 
 now work on the land though the       
 shops, businesses, the surgery, a     
 small industrial estate and the school
 provides employment.However, a large  
 mumber of people commute to Lincoln   
 travelling by car, bus or train.There 
 are many clubs and organisations in   
 the village catering for the          
 recreational and social needs of the  
 people.Most of the older houses are   
 limestone. Dwellings built in the last
 twenty years are mostly bungalows. The
 village has a church, two chapels and 
 four pubs.
