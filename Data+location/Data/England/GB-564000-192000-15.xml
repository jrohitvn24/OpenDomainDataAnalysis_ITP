		<title>15A Country Walk</title>
		<content>      We went for a walk to{Laindon    
{Common}, some mums drove us in their  
 cars to get to the start. It was the  
 wettest June for fourteen years so we 
 had to wear wellington boots and      
 waterproof anoraks, but some of us    
 forgot. The lane was very wet and     
 slippery, with huge puddles because   
 the surface is still only hard earth. 
 There are still ledges alongside the  
 lane the plants we saw were various   
 grasses, buttercups, stinging nettles,
 dog roses, burnet roses, goosegrass,  
 greater willow herb, bracken, hogweed,
 elderberry, blackberry bushes, small  
 field maples, hawthorn and quite large
 oak trees.                            
      One field was growing wheat which
 had a few wild poppies in, and another
 barley.                               
      Rape is also grown in this area, 
 and these three are the main crops.   </content>
