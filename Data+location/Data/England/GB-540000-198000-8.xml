 Small mixed farms in area.Mainly      
permanent pasture with some wheat and  
oilseed.Crown Hill fattened cattle.    
Woodredon Farm is now a riding school. 
                                       
RAVENERS FARM.                         
 MR &amp; MRS WARD who live at Raveners    
farm are now retired.They've lived at  
the farm 22 years.It has over 15 rooms.
400 years ago servants worked there,a  
box which called them remains.The farm 
closed down when the owners retired,   
though the large barns are rented out. 
Poultry and cattle were kept there,but 
DUSTY the dog is the only remaining    
animal there now.She was found in a    
dustcart.Mrs Ward exercises Dusty every
day in the forest.Although the noisy   
motorway is nearby,Mr &amp; Mrs Ward say   
they wouldn't wish to live anywhere    
else because they love it there.       </content>
