		<title>03BERWICK LIFEBOAT RESCUES</title>
		<content> This year 1985,they were called out to
 rescue a man in a van on the causeway 
 to Holy Island.The van had been       
 trapped by the tide coming in and had 
 been surrounded by water.When the     
 lifeboat reached the stranded van they
 found that the driver was fast        
 asleep inside and wasn't aware that he
 needed rescuing.They banged on the    
 side to wake him up and he was        
 surprised to find himself surrounded  
 by sea and lifeboatmen.They also      
 rescue holiday makers blowing out to  
 sea on airbeds and falling down       
 cliffs.They rescue surfboarders and   
 fishermen or sailors who need         
 hospital treatment.They once rescued  
 the lifeboat's own doctor whose engine
 failed when he was out fishing.They   
 enjoyed that.Sometimes they need the  
 coastguard or helicopter to help them.
