		<content>      Fairey Engineering is a factory  
 in Heaton Chapel not far from our     
 school.Fairey's used to make          
 aeroplanes and parts for nuclear power
 stations.Now they specialize in       
 portable metal bridges that are very  
 light.                                
      Fairey's now use computer        
 assisted design.They have a computer  
 centre with a mainframe computer where
 draughtsmen design machinery and plans
 on computer screens.Another computer  
 was plotting the shapes of components.
 The instructions were punched onto    
 black tape.                           
      In the factory they have computer
 controlled machines which cut the     
 components out of metal according to  
 the instructions on the punched tape.
