		<title>07GREENHALGH WITH ESPRICK</title>
		<content> These are two villages intermingled   
 with houses on each side of Fleetwood 
 Road.  There are many types of houses,
 from the old traditional handmade     
 brick and slate roof style, to chalet 
 types with high pitched tile roofs.   
 In Esprick quite a few bungalows have 
 been built in recent years of which   
 most are detached.  The farmhouses    
 here are much smaller than most Fylde 
 farmhouses implying that previously   
 there were more smallholdings in this 
 area.  The old village school and     
 school house here have found a new use
 since closure about ten years ago.    
 The house has been very tastefully    
 restored retaining a lot of its       
 traditional external architecture.    
 The school now has a commercial use as
 offices but the exterior is maintained
 in its original style.
