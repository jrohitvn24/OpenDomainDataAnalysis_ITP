		<content> A parish boundary hedge               
 (Ayston/Uppingham) crosses the path   
 between Uppingham and the bypass.The  
 western part of the hedge is          
 discontinuous and is formed of        
 hawthorn and elder.The hawthorn is    
 especially interesting as some bushes 
 share characteristics of both Midland 
 Hawthorn and Common Hawthorn. Their   
 flowers contained two styles and the  
 leaves were small and deep cut.The    
 eastern part of the hedge is dominated
 by elder.                             
    A small patch of ground between the
 footpath and the allotments contains  
 vetches,stinging nettles,white dead   
 nettle,bindweed and white campion.
