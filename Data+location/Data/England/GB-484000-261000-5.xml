The Corner Shop.                       
                                       
On the corner of the square is a small 
shop.For many years, local people have 
called it "The Corner Shop".Now,many   
years after it was first built from    
locally quarried stone,we rely on it   
for groceries,sweets, tobacco,hot and  
cold drinks,pies and sandwiches.       
   Recently it has taken up a new shape
for it has been completely refurbished 
and a meat counter and "Slush-puppy"   
machine have been installed.
