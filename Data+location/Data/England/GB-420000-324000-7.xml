		<title>07HILLTOP RIDING SCHOOL</title>
		<content>I go riding on Thursdays from 7.30 till
8.30pm and it costs 1 pound 50 which I 
think is quite cheap for a riding      
lesson.We don't have to muck out our   
horses but we saddle them up and in    
autumn and winter lead then into the   
riding shed which is a large warehouse 
with a mud floor.In the spring and     
summer we ride in the fields. The      
stables are always clean and have fresh
hay and the horses and ponies are clean
and well cared for.Some of the horses  
are called Ben,Flake,Jade and Sunny. I 
like going riding there because all the
teachers are very kind and if any pupil
is frightened they help a lot.It is a  
really nice place with a happy         
atmosphere and so you have to book well
in advance because it is very busy.I   
love animals and when I sit on a horse 
I feel that I'm on top of the world!
