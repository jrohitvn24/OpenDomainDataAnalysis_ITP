		<content>{Leominster's}Corn Square begins to    
 buzz with sound early on Friday       
 morning. Caravans and canvas are used 
 to protect the goods on sale which    
 range from fresh items like fish,     
 cheese, meats, vegetables and eggs to 
 sweets,clothing, material, bedding,   
 sheepskin rugs, plants, sunglasses,   
 belts and sandals. The traders come   
 from Gloucester, Wolverhampton,       
 Cheltenham, Ross, Tewkesbury and      
 Stourport.                            
 The first customers arrive with empty 
 baskets, and the murmur of business   
 rises to a babble as the Corn Square  
 becomes a teeming queuing mass of     
 people. For some customers this       
 shopping trip is a weekly one made by 
 bus from outlying villages - an       
 opportunity to meet friends and       
 relations. Is this scene much changed 
 since the Domesday Book of 1086?      </content>
