		<title>10THE BEEFEATER, HOCKLIFFE</title>
		<content> The{Beefeater}still has its former    
 sign the{'White Hart'.}It has been a  
{steak house}for 12 months. The        
 customers are mainly locals from      
{Hockliffe}or people using the{A5.}The 
 average bill is about Â£25 for a family
 of 4. Food is mostly frozen, but meat 
 is fresh.                             
  Of 26 employees most are local. About
 1000 meals a week are served.         
 Employees work about{16-17 hours}a    
 day. More adults come in than         
 children. The change from pub to{steak
{house}has been important in providing 
 local work especially for women in an 
 area where the population has remained
 relatively stable.                    
  Special treats include{free          
 strawberries in the summer,{free      
 badges and{free}trips to{Whipsnade    
{Zoo.}There are about{170 Beefeaters}in
{Britain}and{1}in{Belgium.             </content>
