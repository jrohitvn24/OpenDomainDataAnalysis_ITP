   In our area are two{"A" roads,}the A
 4017 and A 4715. Both run north-south 
 taking traffic from the{motorways     
 north of{Bristol}to{Bath}and          
{Southampton.}Both are narrow and      
 twisting. There is a very sharp corner
 at the bottom of Teewell Hill where it
 crosses the line of the closed        
{railway.}Lorries en route to the      
 motorway have great difficulty        
 negotiating the bend and long{traffic 
 queues occur.                         
   A{ring-road}has been promised for   
 more than fifteen years. Serving as   
 a major{route}round{Bristol East}it   
 will go through fields in our area    
 destroying the natural habitat of     
 local wildlife.  It is certainly      
 needed and will bring relief to the   
 residents of Kingswood.
