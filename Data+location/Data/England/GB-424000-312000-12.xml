		<title>12The population of Lullington</title>
		<content>   Lullington has an ageing population.
 Most inhabitants are aged over 35     
 years and there is a very high        
 proportion of pensioners. This absence
 of the younger generation is largely  
 due to the lack of employment         
 opportunites in the area. Infact 53%  
 of the working population was found to
 be directly related to agriculture in 
 the 1981 census. Those that do not    
 work on local farms commute to        
 Burton-on-Trent, Swadlincote of       
 Tamworth (in each case distances of   
 approximately 10km). Another factor   
 encouraging more mature villagers may 
 be the absence of social facilities   
 desired by younger age groups.
