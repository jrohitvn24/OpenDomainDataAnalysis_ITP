 because information we might forget is
 kept in the computer memory. A popular
 use for computers is playing{games.}A 
 good game is Chuckie Egg. You are     
 Chuckie going along different levels  
 collecting a dozen eggs. You score    
 100 points for each egg. If you       
 collect purple seeds you gain more    
 time and an extra 50 points. Another  
 good game is Space Invaders where you 
 have to shoot down five rows of       
 spaceships and a mother ship. The     
 mother ship is worth 200, 400, 800, or
 1600 points, depending on how many    
 ships are guarding it. The red, blue  
 and brown spaceships are worth 20, 30 
 and 50 points respectively. You can

 including work and business. Big
