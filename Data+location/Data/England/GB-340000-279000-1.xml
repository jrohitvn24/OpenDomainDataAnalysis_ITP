		<title>01Quiet South Shropshire Hills</title>
		<content> Typical backwater of south Shropshire 
 with beautiful scenery and quiet      
 single track lanes.   Many more people
 lived here in 1086 than today-total   
 population today only about two       
 hundred.   Major land use now is      
 farming, especially sheep, but land is
 50% + marginal and soon much of it may
 be derelict or afforested if or when  
 the E.E.C withdraws its subsidies.    
 Few farms and fewer people working on 
 the land.   Most people working well  
 outside the area.   A huge council tip
 catering for much of south Shropshire 
 is perhaps a foretaste of things to   
 come.   A largely forgotten area-but  
 beautiful especially on the 'top'     
 where we and a few others live.
