 decided to interview Miss Barbara     
 Bateson.She told me that she likes    
 living in the country and near the    
 town.And her house is quite new.She   
 was born in her grandmothers house.Her
 hobby is gardening and she has two    
 people in her family her mother and   
 herself.She has lived in the village  
 for 62 years.Her milk was collected   
  jug from Trevispian Vean farm.She    
 likes the main road but said the      
 estate was an eyesore and was not well
 planned.She is now retired from a job
