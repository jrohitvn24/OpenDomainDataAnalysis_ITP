		<content> All the occupants of the cottages are 
 garden lovers &amp; with the exception of 
 one, where the owner is too old, take 
 a delight in beautifying their patch. 
 Most have dogs, often two to a house, 
 &amp; many cats sit around on gateposts.  
 There is a car or van available at    
 each house except two.                
 Some, as owners or tenants, have lived
 in the same house for as long as 40   
 years. The only couples who have any  
 doubts about staying for the rest of  
 their lives, were those with young    
 children, having no easy access to    
 schools or the company of other       
 children.                             
 Neither the hamlet of Heath End nor   
 Calke has any facility at all other   
 than the Saracen's Head public house, 
 &amp; a roadside pillar box. There is no  
 public telephone in reach of either   
 place.                                </content>
