		<content>    This 12sq.km.block has approx. 9   
 sq.km.(2224 acres) of{ARABLE FARMLAND.
 Holdings vary from several hundred    
 acres to smallish fields. Some smaller
 farms have been combined into massive 
 single acreages by hedge removal which
 with spraying has almost eradicated   
 local flora and fauna.                
  { BEET}is a major crop in this area  
 and is grown according to quotas set  
 by the Sugar Corporation and paid for 
 on a sliding scale set by the quality 
 and quantity produced. In late autumn 
 the roads are busy with beet lorries  
 en route to the "Bury" process plant. 
 Crops are rotated on a three year     
 basis (sugar, corn, corn). Although   
 the main crops are{BEET, WHEAT}and    
{BARLEY}there is some rape grown and   
 some peas for seed. Small scale       
 production of{SOFT FRUIT}etc is often 
 sold on a "pick it yourself" basis.   </content>
