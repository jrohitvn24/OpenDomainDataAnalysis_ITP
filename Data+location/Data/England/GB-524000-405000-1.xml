		<title>01An introduction to our area.</title>
		<content> The{12 square kilometre}area which    
 we have surveyed, is an area of the   
 town of{Grimsby.}The area is mostly   
 residential, and agricultural. There  
 is one large council estate, called   
{Nunsthorpe}included in this area, and 
 several different types of private    
 housing areas. Parts of the land which
 is now used for{agriculture,}is       
 shortly to be developed into new      
{housing estates.                      
     {Grimsby}is a port at the mouth of
 the{River Humber.}It was once one of  
 the largest fishing ports in the      
 World. However in recent years the    
{fishing industry}has declined rapidly.
 Other industries have taken over as   
 the major employers of the local      
 population.
