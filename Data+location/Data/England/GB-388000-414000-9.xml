		<title>09WARDLE VILLAGE</title>
		<content> I liked Wardle Village because it was 
 quiet and you could go on walks       
 wherever you wanted to go.            
  There is a reservoir that is called  
 Watergrove to the north of the        
 village.It is still nice but not      
 lovely and quiet as it used to be.The 
 sides of the cobbled Ramsden Rd.going 
 up to the reservoir are now very mucky
 because the road is now used by many  
 windsurfers and sailors in their      
 cars.They have recently been given    
 permission to use the reservoir for   
 recreation.Fences have been put up    
 recently to stop the sheep eating the 
 newly planted trees.Before this people
 and sheep wandered freely on the      
 moors.I hope the sailors and wind     
 surfers won't stay.We don't want them 
 to pollute the water.Despite all this 
 we still like living in Wardle        
 Village.                              </content>
