		<title>08A DAY IN THE LIFE OF- 1</title>
		<content> A long established resident{Mrs.      
{Wheildon,living in Butlers Marston    
 writes about her typical day.         
 "My husband rises early at 6 a.m. and 
 milks our house-cow,feeds the         
 calves,sheep and a few "bottled lambs"
 and proceeds to his part-time postmans
 job at the "Pillertons",returning at  
 lunch time for further work on the    
 small farm or doing gardening or      
 shepherding for neighbours.I get up at
 7 a.m.and exercise our five small     
 terriers,then go by bicycle to Kineton
 High School,where I am part-time      
 assistant librarian,and work three    
 hours daily there.I return home in the
 afternoon and cook our main meal for 6
 p.m.,exercise the terriers again,do   
 gardening or knitting and read a      
 lot.My son and his family live in     
 Butlers Marston and they visit us at  
 weekends when they help on the farm." </content>
