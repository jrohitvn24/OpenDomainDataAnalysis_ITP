		<title>12BONFIRE NIGHT IN LEWES</title>
		<content> The{Borough}Bonfire Society consists  
 of 150 to 200 people and 1 to 2 bands.
 It has been going since 1853 .The most
 exciting {Bonfire Night}for the{      
{Borough}was probably the Queens Silver
 Jubilee when the{Borough}lit the first
{Bonfire}.In the 1960s{Bonfire Night}  
 was cancelled because of floods.The   
 costumes were not chosen because      
 everyone wanted the same one but one  
 person chose a costume and others     
 copied.In 1947 the{Borough}said the{  
{Bonfire Night}prayers under the Houses
 of Parliament. The societies are the  
 Borough ,{Commercial Square , Waterloo
{, South Street ,Cliffe}and{Nevill.}In 
 the "Grand United" there are between  
 1000 and 1200 people and about eight  
 bands,{Cliffe and Nevill}are not      
 included in the "Grand United."
