		<content> Our Domesday area includes the        
 villages of Brighstone and Mottistone 
 and the countryside around them.They  
 are on the southwest coast of the Isle
 of Wight. Our block contains          
 coastline, farmland and a little      
 downland. The village of Brighstone is
 in a valley between the hills and the 
 coast. The area is a popular place for
 tourists and a pleasant one for       
 locals,although perhaps a little      
 isolated from large shopping centres. 
 The tourists are attracted by         
 picturesque scenery, the old          
 buildings, the sea, Brighstone        
 tea_gardens and the campsite on the   
 coast. The countryside is a mixture of
 grazing,arable and woodland. The whole
 patchwork landscape can be seen from  
 Brighstone downs from a viewpoint out 
 of our area.
