		<content>My name is Shona Cox and I am 8.5 years
old.I live in St.Pauls Cray Village.I  
get up at half past seven and I get    
dressed.I go down stairs and have      
breakfast and then I do my lunch box.At
half past eight I go to school.The bell
goes at five to nine and we go into our
classroom.We read a book while our     
teacher calls the register.At quarter  
past nine we go to assembley.Assembly  
is when we meet together and sing songs
like Â£Praise the Lord in the rhythm of 
your music' and Â£Whatever you do'.Then 
we go back to the classroom and do some
work such as maths or our project about
the Normans.At half past ten we go out 
play.I play with my best friends,Jenny,
Zoe,Lisa and Reyna.We come in at       
quarter to eleven and we may write a   
story or have a test.(Cont. on p.6)
