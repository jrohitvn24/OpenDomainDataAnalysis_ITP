		<title>20Conclusion- rural Sowerby</title>
		<content>    About a dozen members of Sowerby   
 Women's Institute have taken part in  
 this survey, and have thoroughly      
 enjoyed the experience. We have       
 learned a lot about our local area,   
 and now appreciate more fully the     
 isolated existence of the people.     
    On the whole, the population of the
 block is contented with its way of    
 life, and visitors receive an extra   
 warm welcome.                         
    The experience has also given our  
 members an opportunity to use a       
 computer for the first time, an       
 experience not without its problems!  
 These have, however, been largely     
 overcome, with the net result of our  
 contribution to the 1985 Domesday     
 Project.
