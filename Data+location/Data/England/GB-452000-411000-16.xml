		<content>   People who are lucky enough to own a
 computer may play on it.But we still  
 play a few old games like Tin Can     
 Tommy,hide-and-seek and Tig.we play   
 these games for something to do or to 
 work up an appetite before a meal.    
  {Whipit Stop}is similar to           
 hide-and-seekbut when you are caught  
 you wait.You are able to move         
 around.If another person,not caught,  
 comes and tigs you,you can run and    
 hide again.                           
  {Dungeons and Dragons}is like tig    
 but when you are caught you must stand
 in a marked area unable to move and   
 with people guarding you called       
 Dragons.The place you are in is called
 a Dungeon.You can also escape if      
 someone,not caught,touches you though 
 such a person runs the risk of being  
 trapped by Dragons.
