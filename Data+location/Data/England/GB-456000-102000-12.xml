		<content> 80% OF THE PEOPLE INTERVIEWED LIKED   
 THIS AREA OF COUNCIL ESTATE           
 SEMI-DETACHED HOUSES.  60% COMPLAINED 
 OF THE AIR POLLUTION , FROM CHEMICAL  
 WORKS FROM THE NORTH AND SEWAGE FROM  
 THE WEST.  THIS TOTALLY URBAN AREA    
 CONTAINS MANY CHESTNUT AND ORNAMENTAL 
 TREES, AND SUPPORTS FOXES, TOADS AND  
 SQUIRRELS.  PEOPLE THAT THE HOUSES ARE
 TOO SMALL, LACK GARAGES AND ARE TOO   
 CLOSE FOR FAMILIES, YET MANY KEEP     
 PETS.  THERE IS SOME VANDALISM,       
 BURGLARY AND DRUNKENESS. 50% OF MEN   
 AND 80% OF WOMEN INTERVIEWED ARE      
 UNEMPLOYED BUT MOST HAVE HOBBIES,     
 ESPECIALLY GARDENING.  MOST WATCH     
 SPORT BUT FEW PARTICIPATE.  CLUBS ARE 
 WELL ATTENDED AND SOME PEOPLE GO TO   
 ONE OF THE FOUR CHRISTIAN CHURCHES.   
 MOST RESIDENTS BELIEVE IN A "GOD" BUT 
 NOT IN CHRIST OF IN AFTER-LIFE.
