		<title>08OLD BUILDINGS IN BENTHAM</title>
		<content> Saint John the Baptist, Low Bentham,  
 is very old being mentioned in the    
 Domesday Book. Part of a Saxon        
 crucifix can be seen. The Rectors go  
 back to 1300. The oldest part of the  
 tower was once used as a lookout post 
 in the 15th Century. The church was   
 rebuilt in 1340 after being destroyed 
 by Scots and rebuilt again in the 19th
 Century. Several Plague Stones are in 
 local walls indicating that Bentham   
 had the Plague.  There is an example  
 shaped like a well in the right hand  
 side of Burton Rd, Low Bentham. There 
 are many 17th Century farms, cottages 
 and houses. Stonegate House dates back
 to 1600. The farm at Kirkbeck has the 
 inscription "16XA76" over the door.   
 Bentham Old Hall, recently restored,  
 was a large farmhouse. The old beams, 
 thick walls and stone flags can still 
 be seen.                              </content>
