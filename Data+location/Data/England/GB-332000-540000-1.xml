		<content>    This upland area with sparse pop-  
 ulation, rising to 303 metres, lies 10
 miles SSW of Carlisle and is a mainly 
 grass farming area.  Cultivation is   
 restricted to fodder for stock.       
    The economy is tied to fluctuations
 in milk production, suckler herds and 
 lamb production, all of which are     
 influenced by government policy as    
 much as by the weather.               
    Many of the houses, which were     
 either farms themselves or farm       
 workers cottages, are now occupied by 
 families who work in the local towns  
 of Carlisle, Penrith and Wigton.      
    Growing numbers of tourists both   
 pass through or stay in the area, some
 of the houses being let for summer    
 holidays and creating a useful add-   
 ition to farm incomes, where the farm 
 no longer has its own hired labour.
