		<content>{St Marys Street}retains many          
 characheristics of Victorian times.   
 The street is{cobbled}and many of the 
 buildings are{restored.               
 Royce is one of them . It was built   
 in 1580 , when it was a college for   
 priests and was called College house  
 Later on it was called The parsage.   
 At one time it was sold to a          
 fishmonger called John Thomson for    
 400 pounds. Another place in the      
 street is now a hair dressers shop.   
 It is said that a ghost called Mabel  
 haunts it. The 17th century stairs    
 seemed cold ,and the ceiling is 6     
 feet high. The building itself is     
 16th century and used to be linked    
 to the Bulls Head across the road.    
 In modern times the street has an     
 annual event called The Old Tyme      
 Market. Which is very popular with the
 local people.                         </content>
