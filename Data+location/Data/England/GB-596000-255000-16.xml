		<content> The Second World War Rattlesden       
 airfield occupies aproximately 15% of 
 the area. The majority has been       
{reclaimed for farming}but some hard-  
 standing remains as does the main run-
 way. Some of the buildings are used   
 for storage.                          
 The runway is used by a local{gliding 
{club.}This has 6o members and owns 4  
 gliders.Other gliders are privately   
 owned.The club meets weekends and Bank
 Holidays and has permission to use the
 airfield for 2 full weeks per year,   
 one at Easter and one in August /Sept.
 Gliders are launched using a mobile   
 winch, which is situated at one end of
 the concrete runway,and enables the   
 gliders to climb to 1200ft in good    
 conditions.An old bus provides an     
 operations base,a communications link 
 between pilot and winch operator and  
 basic catering facilities.            </content>
