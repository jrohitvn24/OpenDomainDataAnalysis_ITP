		<title>08Heapham Windmill.</title>
		<content>  One morning we went to visit Heapham 
 Windmill and talk to its owner Mr.    
 Hewitt. His family has been connected 
 with milling for a long time. The     
 first mill on the site was blown down 
 in a gale. In 1873 they built a new   
 windmill. In 1956 this was struck by  
 lightning and all four sails came of  
 at once. The mill is built from       
 bricks and covered in tar to stop the 
 rain getting in. We saw some old      
 millstones. They were made from flint 
 and millstone grit. They are round and
 flat and they have lines carved into  
 them. There are different patterns for
 different types of milling. One of    
 them had a big line that goes to the  
 middle and two smaller ones.          
  Then we went into a big shed where   
 there was a diesel engine. It was made
 in 1933 in Lincoln by  Rustons. It was
 used to drive a mill for rolling oats.</content>
