		<title>04A Garage in Haltwhistle.</title>
		<content>     My  grandad's garage is on the    
 A69.                                  
    He sells  diesel.and petrol.  It   
 costs Â£2.03 a gallon.  He has a waggon
 park beside the garage.               
    He has a{haulage business}at       
 Plenmeller.  His garage used to be the
 old pit yard of the Plenmeller        
 colliery, which closed in 1930. His   
 office was the joiner's shop, and the 
 engine shed is used as a repair depot.
    He has 19 blue waggons and 54      
 different trailers.  His wagons carry 
 chipboard from the{Weyroc}factory at  
 Hexham to all over England.           
    He brings back Coca-Cola from      
 Milton Keynes, potatoes from          
 Southampton, and woodchips from Wales.
  He uses Volvo and Foden waggons, and 
 his drivers travel about 1700 miles a 
 week.                                 
                                       </content>
