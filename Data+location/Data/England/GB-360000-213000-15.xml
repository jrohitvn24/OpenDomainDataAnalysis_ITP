		<title>15HOUSING IN LYDBROOK</title>
		<content> Types of housing-Lydbrook area.       
 The spread of housing in Lydbrook is  
 restricted by its geographical        
 position in the steep sided narrow    
 valley of the Lyd Brook.The B4234 runs
 along the valley floor.Most of the    
 houses are found on the side of the   
 valley which is intersected by two B  
 roads forming two areas Hangerberry   
 and Worrall Hill.Houses are found by  
 these roadsides and adjoining         
 lanes.There are also unfenced         
 footpaths leading from the valley     
 bottom.The houses are predominantly   
 older cottage style buildings probably
 dating from the latter part of the    
 last century. They are built from the 
 local grey stone and roofed with      
 slate.
