		<content> We picked two girls from another class
 and asked them questions about hand   
 clapping games. One of them knew five 
 and the other knew four. They learnt  
 them in their previous class. The     
 favourite of them all is "see-see".   
 The second favourite is "A Sailor".   
 The words to "See-See" are 'See see my
 Granny come out and play with me, my  
 sister's got the 'flu, chickenpox and 
 measles too. Slide down the drainpipe,
 crawl the kitchen door, I'll be your  
 best of friends for evermore, more,   
 shut that door, number sixty-four,    
 oy!'                                  
 The hand actions are cupping hands,   
 clap your partner's hands, clap twice,
 clap back of hands together and       
 repeat.                               
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
