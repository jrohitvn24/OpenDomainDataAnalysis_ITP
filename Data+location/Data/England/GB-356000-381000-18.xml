		<title>18Changing times in Daresbury</title>
		<content> Life in Daresbury has changed little  
 over the years. It is a quiet place   
 with many of the people elderly. It   
 has the atmosphere of a small country 
 village. The houses are mostly around 
 a hundred years old with council      
 grants being used to install modern   
 facilities such as inside toilets.    
 A lot have had extensions built.      
 Property in the area is quite         
 expensive. The Vicar's wife runs the  
 'Over 60's' Club which has trips to   
 the theatre and the seaside. They play
 bingo at there meetings and tea and   
 biscuits is always included. The Vicar
 also runs a 'Meals-on-wheels' service.
 With the recent celebration of Charles
  Dodgson's birth the village has seen 
 a lot of visitors to the church to see
 the memorial stained glass window.
