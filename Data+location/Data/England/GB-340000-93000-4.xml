 eight semi_detached council owned     
 houses with large well tended gardens 
 on the steep sloping Southern side of 
 the A.35 road These houses surely must
 have one of the most attractive views 
 in the area with an uninterrupted     
 vista of the coastal hills with the   
 sea beyond.

 Morcombelake is to be found on the    
 South Western slopes of Hardown Hill  
 just off the narrow winding road to

 homes with many still showing evidence
 of their cottage beginings can be seen</content>
