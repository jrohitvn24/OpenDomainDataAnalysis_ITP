		<content> In this rural block{public transport} 
 is virtually non-existent, with no    
 railway, limited bus service and no   
 local taxi. The National Bus Company's
 Service 289 from Northallerton to     
 Stokesley makes a detour through      
 Faceby and Carlton; there are 4 buses 
 daily each way, but the latest leaves 
 Faceby at 4.17 pm. Senior school-     
 children travel to the Comprehensive  
 School at Stokesley by{private bus}   
 provided by the N.Yorks Education     
 Committee. Elderly people are taken to
 Stokesley Day Centre by private car.  
 The Whorlton area has no public       
 transport; a{family car}is essential  
 and more than half the families own   
 more than one. Children have to be    
 taken to school, doctor, dentist and  
 riding lessons. Livestock needs       
 transport and there are at least 12   
{Range-Rover/Land Rover}type vehicles. </content>
