		<content> POACHING at sea uses drift netting    
 from small boats.Poaching from the    
 beach happens mainly at Spittal.Nets, 
 with floats at the top and weights at 
 the bottom,are thrown in by hand.A    
 brick or a bottle is on the end of the
 net.                                  
 PROTECTION: water bailiffs have       
 patrolled the Tweed since 1857.They   
 use a boat and four-wheel-drive       
 vehicles.There is also a navy         
 protection vessel which patrols from  
 Dunbar to Holy Island.A light aircraft
 is also used to patrol the area.      
 POLLUTION on the Tweed is kept low by 
 the Tweed Purification Board and the  
 Northumbrian Water Authority.The main 
 sources of pollution are leaks from   
 defective silage clamps.A problem     
 through the summer is the rapid growth
 of water crowfoot,encouraged by the   
 nitrogen in run-off from fertilisers. </content>
