		<title>04HOUSING IN BUCKHURST HILL</title>
		<content> Our block is very much a suburb of    
 London.There is no break between      
 Buckhurst Hill and Woodford ,they     
 just merge together.This is typical of
 London suburbs .There is a break      
 between Buckurst &amp; Chigwell caused by 
 the valley of the  R. Roding &amp; the    
 M11. Here there is little housing as  
 it is mostly wasteland.The block is   
 not a cheap place to live.The average 
 cost of a house is Â£100,000. Council  
 housing is limited and in short supply
 . Most of the houses are detached with
 big gardens . The area is still       
 developing. One of the things locals  
 have noticed is the amount of new     
 housing. The area has a number of old 
 houses with large grounds. These are  
 redeveloped with builders sqeezing on 
 smaller houses. This is the only way  
 there can be any new building as we   
 are in the Green Belt.                </content>
