		<content>{ Hartford and Barnton}have many       
 interesting historical sites. Among   
 them are:                             
{ Hartford Hall}was built in the 16th  
 century as a nunnery. Among the       
 legends about it is one that a nun was
 murdered and now haunts the reception 
 area. Another says there was a passage
 from the Hall to Vale Royal Abbey     
 where some monks lived. Hartford Hall 
 is now a three star hotel.            
{ Anderton Lift}was designed by Edwin  
 Clark. It connects the River Weaver   
 and the Trent and Mersey Canal and is 
 now the only barge lift in the world. 
 It opened in July 1875. It used to be 
 operated by water but in 1907 it      
 became electrically operated. In 1975 
 extensive renovations were undertaken 
 but it now needs restoring if it is   
 ever to work again.
