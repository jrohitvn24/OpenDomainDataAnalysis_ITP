		<title>06WELBECK ABBEY</title>
		<content> The Welbeck Estates Company owns most 
 of the land in this area. Welbeck     
 Abbey is the seat of the Portland     
 family and although the family no     
 longer live in the Abbey they still   
 occupy Welbeck Woodhouse, a large     
 house in the park. The park is private
 property and the public are not       
 allowed to wander at will. As a       
 result, little has changed since the  
 nineteenth century and the narrow     
 estate roads wind for miles among     
 planted woodland and open countryside.
 There are numerous old buildings which
 have been converted to other uses. The
 huge Riding School built by the 5th   
 Duke of Portland is now used as a     
 warehouse by a publishing company. The
 old school is now the hospital for    
 Welbeck College and other buildings   
 are used as accommodation for the     
 staff.                                </content>
