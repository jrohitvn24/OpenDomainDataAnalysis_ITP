		<title>18FARMING IN CRANHAM</title>
		<content> Upminster has open countryside to the 
 north,east and west and much is{good  
{agricultural land.}London clay soils  
 dominate and with gentle relief       
 provide good land for{cereals}on the  
 better drained sites and for{potatoes 
{and pasture}on heavier soils.The      
 presence of chalk increases woodland  
 cover to the north and the sand and   
 gravel deposits to the south provide  
 home for both{vegetables}(mainly      
 brassics) and for commercial quarring.
 Although climate and soils influence  
 the land use pattern economic         
 considerations are also very          
 important,not least the closeness of  
 the London market,and values are high 
 and{farming is extensive.}Vegetables  
 and soft fruit are grown for the very 
 large local market and there are      
 several'self pick'farms close by.Dairy
 farming has been replaced by cereals. </content>
