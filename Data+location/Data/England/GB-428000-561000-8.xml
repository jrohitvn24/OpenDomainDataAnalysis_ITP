		<content> The Hebburn Hospital is situated near 
 East View and was built in 1899. We   
 were met by Sister Powell who has been
 working at the hospital for 12 years. 
 There are 24 patients in the hospital,
 the eldest being 104 and she has been 
 there 6 years. The youngest patient is
 75 and has been there 1 year. There   
 are 5 full time nurses, 10 part time, 
 and their duties are to feed the      
 patients, bath them and generally look
 after them. The doctor visits them    
 three or four times a week to check on
 their health.                         
 The ladies fill in their spare time by
 throwing bean bags for exercise,      
 playing Bingo, watching T.V.,         
 listening to the radio, knitting and  
 sewing.                               
 The Hospital used to be a fever       
 hospital for scarlet fever etc.
