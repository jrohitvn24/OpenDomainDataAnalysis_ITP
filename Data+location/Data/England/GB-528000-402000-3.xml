		<content> A young man in our village tries to   
{conserve birds and hedgerows.}He has  
 been conserving nature for five years 
 and keeps an eye on the countryside   
 surrounding the village. He likes what
 he is doing but it gets depressing    
 when he sees the countryside starting 
 to disappear. He keeps records of his 
 work. He has seen a{redwing,}a{sparrow
{hawk, barn owls, foxes, newts, frogs, 
{rabbits}and{weasels.}He has been in   
 dispute with the council about not    
 being told about building plans. As a 
 result they have now postponed the    
 removal of the hedgerows until        
 August.He has seen{cowslips, cuckoo   
{flowers}and{giant hogweed}on the      
 building site. He thinks it is a      
 worthwhile thing to do because if     
 nobody watches nature our birds,      
 animals and flowers could disappear.
