		<title>02The Reservoir,Ravensthorpe.</title>
		<content>Ravensthorpe Reservoir covers l83 acres
and is situated N.E. of the village    
with a causeway crossing over it.It    
was the first to be built in Northamp- 
tonshire and was completed in l896.Up  
to this date all water was supplied by 
wells.It is fed by the Stowe Brook and 
has a capacity of 4l4 million gallons  
of water which supplies Ravensthorpe,  
Spratton,Long Buckby,Barby,Creaton and 
Crick.At the eastern end is a dam and a
filtration and chlorination plant which
at present is being modernised.There is
a tunnel running underneath it from    
Hollowell to Ravensthorpe.The area is  
made attractive by the trees which were
planted at the time of its construction
A car park has been built to improve   
public access but there is local dis-  
content with the annual charge.There is
no access to the small western area as 
this is a wild life sanctuary.         </content>
