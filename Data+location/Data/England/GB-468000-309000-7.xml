		<title>07THE GOLDEN FLEECE PUB (2)</title>
		<content>  Each week Bill and is wife clean the 
 pumps from the cellar to the bar. He  
 thinks that it is very important to   
 look after the beer cellar well       
 because it keeps the beer better. In  
 winter there is always an open fire   
 which he believes that the customers  
 like.                                 
  During the week the main customers   
 are from the village, partiicularly in
 winter. but at the weekends and in the
 summer Bill has lots of customers from
 all over the county. Bill and his wife
 also serve meals which are becoming   
 increasingly popular in public houses.
 Also the Golden  Fleece has a lonely  
 beer garden which on a warm day is    
 full with families.                   
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
