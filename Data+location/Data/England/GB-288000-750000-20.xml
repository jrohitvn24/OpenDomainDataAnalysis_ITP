		<title>20A Traffic Survey Report</title>
		<content> We carried out our{Survey}on the main 
 road outside our school,the{A827.     
 We first of all drew our chart to take
 down our results.We then went out in  
 groups of two to count the vehicles   
 which passed from Aberfeldy to        
 Pitlochry and also the opposite way.  
 We found there were more cars than    
 anything else.There were 84 cars going
 to{Aberfeldy}and 103 vehicles         
 altogether in 1 hour and 10 minutes.  
 Going to{Pitlochry}in the same time   
 were 95 cars and 124 vehicles in all. 
 Our survey was carried out between    
 11.10 hours and 12.20 hours on a      
 Friday.                               
 We found out that there were more     
 vehicles going towards Pitlochry than 
 Aberfeldy.There were no buses although
 we are on a main tourist route and    
 there were not so many farm vehicles  
 as we had expected.                   </content>
