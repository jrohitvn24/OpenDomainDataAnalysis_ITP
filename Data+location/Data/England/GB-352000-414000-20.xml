		<title>20"Donkey"</title>
		<content>To play Donkey you need two or more    
players.You have a ball and throw it at
a wall - let it bounce and jump - the  
person behind is supposed to catch     
it.If they don't,they get a "D".If the 
next one fails they get a "D" also.This
goes on to the end of the line.The next
time round they get an"O".The game goes
on like this until one person has      
"DONKEY", then they are out.           
"SEVENTIES"                            
This game needs a ball and a wall.We   
start with SEVEN throw, catch;then SIX 
throw,bounce,catch.FIVE bounce, catch. 
FOUR-slamsy... ,THREE- under leg...TWO 
-clapsy....ONE -turn around...Then we  
do all that in --one                   
hand,baby,winsy,hopsy and last of all  
one eye.One person carries on until    
they drop the ball.Then another person 
tries until the end of the catches.
