 pitch,some baby swings,adult swings,a 
 banana slide,climbing frame and a     
 small sand pit.Another place to play  
 is the woods where you can play hounds
 and hares and hide and seek.We have a 
 playing field which has a rugby club  
 and a full size rugby pitch and it has
 a BMX track.We have another playing   
 area on the club green we play        
 football,tennis,cricket,tigy,rounders 
 and sometimes we play on the co op    
 wall to play squash and tennis and    
 sometimes we play walley.This is      
 played with a few people and a        
 football and the one who misses the   
 wall is out and the one left in is the
