		<content> There are two Primary schools, one in 
 Dringhouses and one in Woodthorpe.    
 They provide education for children of
 four plus to eleven years of age. They
 also provide an outlet for parental   
 talents.There is a {Parents           
{Association} at each school. The      
 parents organize Summer fairs, discos 
 for children and jumble sales as well 
 as many other events.                 
 They raise money for much needed extra
 equipment in the schools.             
 Parents also assist in the schools as 
 classroom helpers where invaluable    
 work is done.                         
 Due to the reorganization of the      
 secondary school system in York this  
 year (1985) there is only one         
 secondary school in our area but three
 others are very close making a group  
 of four from which parents can choose 
 to send their children.               </content>
