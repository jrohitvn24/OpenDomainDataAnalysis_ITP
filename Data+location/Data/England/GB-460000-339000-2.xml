		<content> We arrived at Colwick woods at about  
 11 a.m. on the 5th May 1985. We stayed
 there for about 2 1/4 hours.The ground
 was hard. We did not see any mammals  
 but we saw rabbit droppings by the    
 golf course and mole hills on banks.We
 also saw a trail of hoove prints.     
 Below a hazel tree there were some nut
 husks which suggest that squirrels had
 been around.                          
 I also counted the insects including  
 slugs spiders and worms.I saw two     
 ladybirds _ a two spot and a seven    
 spot _ both of them on fern leaves.We 
 also spotted two bees which flew past 
 us, probably searching for nectar. We 
 saw several gnats flying past us.     
 Staying with flying insects, we saw a 
 solitary wasp fly into the canopy. We 
 also saw a cabbage white butterfly,   
 flying from plant to plant also       
 looking for food.                     </content>
