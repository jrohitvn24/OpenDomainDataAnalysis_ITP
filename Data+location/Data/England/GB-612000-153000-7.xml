		<title>07LOWER HARDRES SCHOOL</title>
		<content> The red brick one-storey school was   
 built in 1846. Today Lower Hardres    
 Primary School has 19 pupils aged from
 5 to 11 years. The Headmistress is    
 assisted by one full time teacher. Two
 pre-fabricated classrooms have been   
 added. There is a netball pitch, grass
 playing field with adventure play     
 ground and sandpit. For nature study a
 small pond with plant life has been   
 created. Some extra activities have   
 been a study of pigs with a visit to a
 local farm.Also visits to Canterbury  
 Cathedral and the London zoo. A BBC   
 computer, monitor and disc drive were 
 borrowed for two weeks and it is hoped
 to purchase this equipment so that    
 pupils may consolidate basic work. At 
 the age of 11 pupils go on to Grammar 
 or Secondary Schools in Canterbury. A 
 few attend Chartham Secondary School.
