		<content> A large part of the community of      
 Cropwell Butler works in Nottingham   
 and commutes by car. Access to the    
 City has been improved by the         
 construction of the Clifton Bridge &amp;  
 the conversion of an old rail-line    
 into a vehicular bridge. With the     
 existing Trent Bridge, these three    
 river crossings have attracted        
 commuters to villages south of the    
 river because of the greater ease of  
 access to the City. There is no train 
 service from the villages but there is
 a regular bus service to Nottingham   
 (about 1 per hour) and a bus to       
 Bingham on Market day. The bus from   
 Bingham to Melton Mowbray (4 times    
 daily on week days) passes Wiverton   
 Hall.                                 
 There are special buses to the schools
 at Bingham and Cropwell Bishop in term
 time.                                 </content>
