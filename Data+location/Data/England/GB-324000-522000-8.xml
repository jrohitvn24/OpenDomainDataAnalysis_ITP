		<title>08Keswick's market</title>
		<content> In 1300 Thomas De Derwentwater proved 
 his right to have a market at his     
 Manor of Keswick and was given        
 permission by King Edward I.The trade 
 the market first attracted was corn   
 and provisions.There was a cattle     
 market on Oct II and a Rams and cheese
 on the Saturday after the 29th Oct.We 
 intervied a talkative fishman.He said 
 they don't make as much money now.The 
 rents have gone up from Â£20 to Â£75.The
 price of petrol has gone up which     
 affects the stall holders, so does    
 inflation.The market is now closed to 
 cars so other people have tried to put
 up more cheap stalls but the          
 shopkeepers objected.The stallholders 
 also said Bank holidays and Whit      
 holidays are no good for business     
 because people dont come to buy food. 
 They are staying in hotels or guest   
 houses.                               </content>
