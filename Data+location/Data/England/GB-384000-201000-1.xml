 Our area is situated in two valleys   
 diverging from Stroud and on the      
 plateau between the two valleys where 
 Rodborough and Minchinhampton Commons 
 are situated.In one valley,the A419 to
 Cirencester,we have the villages of   
 Brimscombe and Thrupp and in the other
 valley, the A46 to Bath, we have the  
 villages of Woodchester and Kingscourt
 with the fringes of Rodborough village
 to the North.The excellent vantage    
 point of Rodborough Fort (rebuilt     
 1861) affords a panoramic view of the 
 Severn Vale with a huge meander of the
 River Severn which has as a backcloth 
 the beginnings of the  Forest of Dean 
 and beyond that the Black Mountains of
 Wales.The five Stroud valleys were    
 full of cloth mills in the 17th       
 century and many of the original      
 buildings are used as factories today.</content>
