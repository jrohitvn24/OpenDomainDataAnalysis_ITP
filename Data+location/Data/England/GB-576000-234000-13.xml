		<title>13ENTERTAINMENT - HEDINGHAM</title>
		<content>   Most of our entertainments are of   
 the amateur variety including         
 pantomime and a play produced annually
 by Hedingham Amateur Theatre Society  
 in Sible Hedingham. Many concerts and 
 other performances are given in both  
 Parish Churches and Village Halls.    
 Whist Drives, Bingo and Discos are run
 usually in aid of various clubs and   
 organisations quite frequently.       
   We have very few commercial         
 entertainments. The Bell Inn in Castle
 Hedingham houses a Folk Club which    
 often has visiting professional       
 musicians, and the 'Memories' Public  
 House runs discos weekly and has      
 occasional 'live' performances.
