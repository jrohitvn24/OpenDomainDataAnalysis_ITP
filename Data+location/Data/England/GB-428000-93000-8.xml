		<content> Most of the land is farmland with some
 woodland.Most of the woodland belong  
 to private estates and is             
 protected.The texture of the soil is  
 predominantly gravel and clay.        
 There are several small nurseries     
 selling flowers,plants and shrubs.The 
 largest being Efford Experimental     
 Station.                              
 Recent years have seen the building of
 a number of large housing developments
 after nine years at least of building 
 restriction.The restriction was       
 imposed because of inadequate sewage  
 disposal.The industry in the area is  
 mostly light and pollution as a result
 is minimal.                           
 The area is covered by the Wiltshire  
 and Dorest Bus Service.There is an    
 hourly bus service to the neighbouring
 towns.The majority of the public are  
 car owners.                           </content>
