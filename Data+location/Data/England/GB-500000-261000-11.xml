      About thirty adults and ten      
 children live in Knotting.  We        
 discovered that only two adults and no
 children at all go to any clubs.  In  
 fact there are no village clubs in    
 Knotting so the two adults go to a    
 different village for entertainment.  
 Most people stay at home or go to     
 Luton for entertainment.  Because no  
 children go to clubs they either go   
 out to play or watch television.  Most
 children watch television for l-2     
 hours per night.  Three adults watch  
 television 5-l0 hours per week.  Ten  
 adults go to church and two children  
 go to Sunday school.  Ten adults      
 watch television for 3-4 hours and six
 for 8 hours.
