		<content>{Ring Road and Development}            
There is a new ring road due for       
completion soon which will link the Lea
Park estate with Towersey Road. Many   
residents fear that the town will lose 
its identity if the growth is not      
carefully controlled. However, others  
feel that Thame needs to attract new   
industry. Planning permission has been 
sought for DAF Trucks and United       
Biscuits to set up their UK            
headquarters in Thame using the ring   
road development.                      
{One school site}                      
There has been a proposal to reorganise
Lord Williams Secondary School to one  
site on the Oxford Road. Some people   
feel that this will enable a better use
of manpower ond resources. Opponents   
feel that this might create a large im-
personal environment for learning. The 
East site would have to be sold.       </content>
