		<title>02Keadby Bridge Area.</title>
		<content> The River Trent enters our rectangle  
 on the western edge of the top left   
 hand corner of our block.             
 There's a lot of mud in the River     
 Trent. It's a chocolate brown colour  
 and there are little whirl pools in   
 it.                                   
 It's a tidal river.                   
 Keadby Bridge stands out as a feature 
 of this area. It carries road and rail
 traffic across the River Trent from   
 the eastern part of the county (South 
 Humberside).                          
 Years ago (about 30) it used to lift  
 to allow river traffic to reach       
 Gainsborough.                         
 It was always a severe bottle neck to 
 road transport, especially as lorries 
 grew larger and rail transport became 
 less important.                       
 This problem was eased when the M180  
 was completed in 1982.                </content>
