		<title>17Transport in Northill</title>
		<content>{Cars}are used by many residents as the
{bus service}run by United Counties is 
 limited.  Pensioners hold subsidised  
 bus passes. Some firms pick up workers
 from the village by coach, and{school 
{buses}run daily.  Voluntary transport 
 is organised for hospital visiting.   
 As Northill village is between the A 1
 and Bedford,{commercial vehicles}form 
 much of the daytime traffic.  Most    
 evenings, vegetables for sale at      
 market are collected by lorry.        
 Speeds through the village tend to be 
 excessive despite the 30 m.p.h. limit.
{Horse riding}and{cycling}are popular, 
 and ponies in traps are often driven. 
{Airliners}&amp;{helicopters}pass overhead 
 daily, also{micro-lights}and other    
 small planes from nearby Shuttleworth 
 Aerodrome. {Airships}from Cardington, 
 and{hot-air balloons}in brilliant     
 colours are frequently seen.          </content>
