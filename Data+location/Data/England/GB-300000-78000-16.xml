		<title>16SATURDAYS IN EXMOUTH</title>
		<content> On Saturdays I wake up at about       
 10 o'clock, get dressed and have my   
 breakfast, usually toast but no drink.
 There are four of us in our family and
 we own a Guest House called Devonia in
 St. Andrews Road.                     
 We have four residents who stay with  
 us all the year round and a visitor   
 who is staying with us for two weeks, 
 so we are full.                       
 Sometimes Mum and I walk into town.   
 She might buy me a 'teebag' teeshirt  
 (with mesh at the top) and a pencil   
 skirt (straight with two pleats at the
 sides). All together they cost about  
 twenty pounds. I go to my friends     
 house for tea. We have mince, cabbage 
 and roast potatoes. We play Jet Set   
 Willy on the computer until 8 p.m.    
 We argue and giggle until midnight.
