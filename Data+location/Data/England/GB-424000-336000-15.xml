		<content> RECREATION _  THE THREE HORSE SHOES,  
 the public house on Long Lane, is a   
 hundred years old.  The kitchen used  
 to be a cowshed and during World War  
 II local school children used the     
 cellar during air-raids.  Most of the 
 customers are townspeople, mainly from
 Derby.  Once a month during the summer
 people pay to come from Brailsford    
 Stables in a horse-drawn cart.  Morris
 Dancers perform on May Day and at     
 other times.  The pub is owned by Ind.
 Coope and the Licensee is Mr. David   
 Salt. Draught Burton beer and Skol    
 larger are very popular and sell at   
 79p a pint. Double Diamond is 77p a   
 pint. They also sell Kit-Kat, Mars,   
 crisps, nuts and sandwiches. 96       
 gleaming horse brasses and 3 miner's  
 lamps make it look welcoming. The dog,
 Shandy, who is 18 years old, is a firm
 favourite.                            </content>
