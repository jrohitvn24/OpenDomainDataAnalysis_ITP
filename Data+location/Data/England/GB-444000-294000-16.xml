		<content> We asked our sample whether or not    
 they believed in God; 6 declined to   
 answer, 22 replied yes and 8 replied  
 no.                                   
 When asked what their religion was,   
 56% said that they were {Church of    
{England,}6% were{Methodist,}8% were{  
{Catholic} and 5% followed other       
 religions. 25% had no religion.       
 When questioned about how often they  
 attended church the results were:-    
     {Once a week    6                 
    { Once a month   2                 
     {Once a year    2                 
   {  Rarely         14                
     {Never          12}               
 This lack of attendance clearly shows 
 evidence of the declining importance  
 of religion in modern society.
