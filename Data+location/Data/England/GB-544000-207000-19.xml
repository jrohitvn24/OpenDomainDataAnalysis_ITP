		<content> The biggest area of crime in Harlow is
 theft,mostly of electrical goods      
 including videos,computers e.t.c.Last 
 year there was more motor vehicle     
 theft so the chief constable of Essex 
 told the chief superintendent of      
 Harlow to get a group of police       
 officers to concentrate on car theft. 
 Then the numbers of car thefts went   
 down.Shoplifting is also big in       
 Harlow.                               
     Harlow has a policy of            
 neighbourhood policing.The reason for 
 this is so that a police constable can
 get to know people.They tell them if  
 they are committing a minor offence   
 like parking their car on the         
 pavement,or warn people if they are   
 about to commit an offence.           
    Harlow has its own Magistrates     
 Court.
