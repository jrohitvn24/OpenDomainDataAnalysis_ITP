My house is detached and square.   It  
has eight windows and two doors.   The 
porch is a little roof which keeps the 
rain from falling round the door.   At 
the side of the house there is a drain-
pipe which lets the rain run off the   
black-tiled roof.   The house is made  
of bricks, cement, wood for the window 
frame and glass for the actual window. 
My house has eight rooms.   They are   
the kitchen, dining room, living room, 
three bedrooms and two bathrooms.   The
kitchen has a washer to wash clothes   
and a cooker to cook food.   There is  
also a sink where dishes are washed.   
There is a fridge to keep things cool. 
In the dining room is a table and four 
chairs and a television.   The living  
room has a settee, a television, a fire
to keep us warm and a wall cabinet.
