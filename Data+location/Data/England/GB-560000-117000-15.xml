		<content> The club was probably founded about   
 lOO years ago. Originally play took   
 place on the village green. In l947 Mr
 Peter Dunn made available a field in  
 Rookery Lane on which a permanent     
 pitch was created and is now          
 maintained in excellent condition. No 
 rent is asked for this facility. A    
 small pavilion is on the site         
 comprising two changing rooms and a   
 kitchen. The club has about 2O members
 of whom 4 are village residents. Other
 players come from Horam &amp; Heathfield. 
 Matches are usually played on Sundays.
 There are about 25 fixtures each      
 season. In l985 just over half        
 resulted in victory. At present       
 subscriptions are Â£2.OO a year and a  
 match fee of Â£l.OO is payable at each 
 game played. An annual dinner &amp; dance 
 is held in the village hall at which  
 the refreshment ladies are recognised.</content>
