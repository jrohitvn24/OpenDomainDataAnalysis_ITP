		<title>15LOCAL BIRD POPULATION</title>
		<content>  We tried to find out the most common 
 and the least common type of birds in 
 the grid area. In{Longwood}at the time
 of the survey (midsummer 1985),the    
 most common bird was the{House Martin.
 House Martins spend the summer in the 
 area then migrate to warmer climates  
 during our winter. We found that the  
 least common birds were: robins,      
 starlings, carrion crows, black-headed
 gulls and black birds. Altogether,we  
 found 9 species of birds common to    
 this area. We also found a reason for 
 birds in our area being so few: the   
 food available to them is sufficient  
 but not abundant and is sparse        
 compared to the average bird habitat. 
 Also the ground is high and dry and   
 water is scarce. The shelter available
 was limited to rocks, shrubs and      
 crannies as there are few trees in the
 area.                                 </content>
