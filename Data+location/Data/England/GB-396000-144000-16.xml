		<title>16EDUCATION IN CHITTERNE</title>
		<content> People in Chitterne were sorry to see 
 the village school close in 1969 but  
 there were insufficient children to   
 keep it open.  Primary school children
 now go to school in Codford or        
 Tilshead, whilst those of secondary   
 age go to Warminster or Market        
 Lavington.   Colleges of Further      
 Education are situated in Salisbury   
 and Trowbridge.  The Education        
 Authority provides transport to       
 Codford and Warminster.  Tilshead     
 school has its own mini-bus which     
 collects children from Chitterne, and 
 parents take to Lavington by private  
 car.  Travel grants are provided for  
 those attending the Colleges. The     
 school bus leaves for Warminster at   
 7.50 a.m. whilst those going to       
 Colleges have to be in Codford by 7.30
 a.m. to catch the service buses.
