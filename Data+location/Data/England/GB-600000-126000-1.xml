		<title>01IVYCHURCH AND BRENZETT</title>
		<content> This area, in common with Rommney     
 Marsh. is flat and crossed by drainage
 dykes although it is not quite as well
 drained as most of the marsh. Lane use
 is intensive farming and managed      
 grassland. In the south west the A259 
 partly follows the Rhee Wall, the old 
 coastal defence wall. With low density
 population the area contains two      
 towns; Brenzett, on the busy junction 
 of the A259, A2070 and B2080 sees much
 through traffic and has a mixture of  
 cottages and poor housing. Th general 
 feeling is of decline but curiously   
 neat to the old school house is a     
 Rolls Royce showroom. Ivychurch, a    
 small but pretty ribbon development   
 boasts a fine church and village inn. 
 It has a mixture of older, poorer     
 housing and new large detached houses 
 with evidence of development of the   
 latter.                               </content>
