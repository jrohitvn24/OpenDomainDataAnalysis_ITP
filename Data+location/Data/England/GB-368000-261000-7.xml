		<title>07ST.KENELM'S CHURCH.</title>
		<content> The Church of{St.Kenelm}is built of   
 freestone rubble and is roofed with   
 modern tiles. Much of the building    
 dates from{1200,}although the present 
 spire replaces the one blown down in  
 the{17th Century.}The Church occupies 
 a prominent position adjacent to the  
 main road through the village and     
 provides an interesting subject for   
 the artist or photographer. The       
{Rector,}who is also responsible for   
 the churches at{Harpley}and the       
{Shelsleys,}lives in the new{Rectory   
 adjacent to the church. A{survey}of   
 nearly ninety per cent of households  
 in the village showed that 18%        
 attended the Parish Church weekly,14% 
 monthly, 42% rarely, and 26% never.   
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
