		<title>14CONSERVATION IN SADDLEWORTH</title>
		<content> There is an ongoing project at Rye Top
 Farm, Knowl Top, &amp; a completed one at 
 adjacent Knowl Farm, run by the local 
 Groundwork Trust in conjunction with  
 the British Trust for Conservation    
 Volunteers. The Groundwork Trust can  
 arrange with landowners to utilise    
 grants from the Countryside Commission
 (50% for tree-planting &amp; some for the 
 restoration of stone walls) in such   
 areas as this, which was at one time  
 covered with trees. Also at Knowl Farm
 there has been hedge-planting, &amp; the  
 erection of protective fencing against
 sheep, to aid this conservation work. 
 There is also ongoing work on our     
 section of the Huddersfield Narrow    
 Canal, with five local locks being    
 restored, to revitalise the whole     
 stretch to Uppermill &amp; beyond. Greater
 Manchester Council is helping to fund 
 this canal conservation work.         </content>
