		<title>12YVONNE'S DAY IN AMBERLEY</title>
		<content> A typical day would be to get up at   
 7.30, wash, dress and have breakfast -
 Weetabix and milk. At 8.25 I go to    
 school by car with my friend Claire   
 and my sister Christine. When we      
 arrive I play skipping with my        
 friends. When the bell goes, we go    
 inside and Mrs Mann takes the         
 register. We go into the hall for     
 assembly. After Assembly we do Maths  
 and English. At playtime we have milk 
 and go outside. Before lunch we have a
 story. Before we eat we go out to     
 play. In the afternoon we do swimming 
 and craft. At hometime, we put our    
 chairs on the tables and say a prayer.
 My Dad collects me. At home I watch   
 televeision until tea. After my bath I
 watch television again until 9.00 when
 I go to bed.                          
                                       
                                       </content>
