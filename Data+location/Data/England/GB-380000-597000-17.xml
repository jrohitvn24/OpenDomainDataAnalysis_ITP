		<content> The area covered has{a population of }
{96.}Contrary to local belief it was   
 found that Rochester and its immediate
 surroundings are not dominated by the 
 over 60 age group.{25% of the    }    
{population are under l8.}The{19_25 age
 group is fairly small, 10%. 55% are   
 aged between 25 and 60. 20% are over  
 60.{There are 3 octogenarians and 1  }
{nonagenarian.     }                   
  The majority of the population has   
 lived in the area all their life,     
 worked in the area too and intend to  
 remain there. The most{transient}group
 is composed of those aged between 16  
 and 21 who are in full_time education.
 When they have completed their courses
 they expect to{move out of the area to
{find suitable employment.     }
