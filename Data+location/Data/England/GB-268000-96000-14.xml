		<title>14THE SHOP CONTINUED.</title>
		<content>   The shopkeeper gets most of the food
 from the Cash and Carry warehouse.A   
 baker delivers bread once a week,the  
 butcher calls twice a week and        
 greengrocery is delivered during the  
 night so that it is fresh to sell in  
 the morning.The milkman delivers milk 
 and a local farm provides cream.      
   The shop is open before 09.00hrs.so 
 that the children can call before     
 school and closes at 17.30hrs.or when 
 the last customer leaves.It is closed 
 for one hour at dinner time,on        
 Saturday afternoon and all day Sunday.
   The Post Office is also open at     
 these times and does all the things   
 that an ordinary Post Office does.
