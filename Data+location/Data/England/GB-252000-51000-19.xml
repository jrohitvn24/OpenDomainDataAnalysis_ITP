		<title>19The E.C.C. Quarries</title>
		<content> The E.C.C Quarries at Plymstock are   
 situated on a private road off        
 Billacombe roundabout. The present    
 quarry is a combination of the two    
 largest quarries in the Plymouth area,
 Moorcroft and Haye. The stone mined   
 there is 350 million years old and is 
 called Middle Devonian Limestone.     
 Every week at the quarry 20-25        
 thousand tonnes of limestone is       
 mined. The broken rock is taken to the
 crusher through which it passes twice 
 before being screened twice. Screening
 is a method of grading the stone in   
 accordance to its size. Only 10% of   
 the finished rock is sent to other    
 countries. The most important piece of
 machinery in the quarry  is the       
 conveyor belt.
