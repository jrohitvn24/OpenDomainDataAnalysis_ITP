		<title>17THE VILLAGE HALL PRIVETT</title>
		<content> At the Bailey Green cross-roads stands
 the Village Hall, a simple single     
 storey building, the centre for social
 events.  There is a strong community  
 spirit among the young people, who    
 organise the Summer fete, the Harvest 
 supper, the Christmas party, barbecues
 and dancing to a discotheque.         
 Since the closure of the Church a     
 service of Holy Communion is held     
 monthly in the Village Hall, followed 
 by Family Service which the children  
 attend. These are conducted by the    
 Vicar from Hawkley.                   
 There is at present no W.I. in the    
 village, but several young women      
 attend meetings of the Housewives'    
 Register, held usually in members'    
 homes.                                
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
