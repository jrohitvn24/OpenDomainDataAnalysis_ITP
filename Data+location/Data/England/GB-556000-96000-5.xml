		<content>    Many feel that the precious chalk  
 downland - a National Heritage Area - 
 on which many rare flowers such as    
 cowslips, kidney vetch, fragrant and  
 bee orchids, viper's bugloss and field
 fleawort grow, should be conserved by 
 reclaiming the land from farmers and  
 their crops. However, this would      
 entail great expenditure as the land  
 would have to be kept free from scrub 
 by tractors rather than by sheep      
 grazing as it is now.                 
    Never the less, the farmers in the 
 area, unlike most others, are         
 prohibited by law to use pesticides as
 the downland is a water-catchment     
 area. Perhaps it is the great public  
 dislike of barbed-wire fences and     
 corrugated-iron sheds that disfigure  
 the landscape that strengthens the    
 case of those opposed to farming on   
 the Downs.                            </content>
