		<title>05THE PARKYNS ALMSHOUSES BUNNY</title>
		<content> Miss Honor Duncton who was once our   
 school caretaker lives in one of the  
 flats in the Armshouses. The outside  
 door is very low and the walls are    
 thick. There are three unusual oval   
 windows. At the far end is the old    
 Parkyns school which is now the Men's 
 Institute snooker room and upstairs is
 another flat. There are old beams in  
 the attic and the slate roof has been 
 recently restored.                    
         {THE RANCLIFFE ARMS           
 Mr. Alan Hill, an ex-Forest goalkeeper
 has owned the Rancliffe Arms for seven
 years. Sir Thomas Parkyns rebuilt the 
 inn and held wrestling matches in the 
 grounds, now the car park. It is said 
 that Dick Turpin stopped there, but   
 most of the activities today are      
 organised by the Sports and Social    
 Committee. There are darts teams and  
 each year a village quiz is held.     </content>
