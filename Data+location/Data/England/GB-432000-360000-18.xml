		<content>    In this farming area,the fields    
 are much the same as they have been   
 for years. Dividing the fields, and   
 lining the lanes are drystone         
 Derbyshire walls. They have no cement 
 or mortar to hold them together, but  
 have stood for hundreds of years. Not 
 many people can build them now.       
 Although they have the appearance of  
 being thrown together, they are       
 carefully laid. Most farming land is  
 grazing,meadow and arable. It is sad  
 to see the stubble being burnt        
 polluting the air. Over a hundred     
 years ago nothing was wasted. The     
 farmer had the corn, the gleaners came
 and gathered in their aprons loose    
 ears from the stubble,then the geese  
 were turned into the field to fatten  
 up for Michaelmas.Now the combine     
 harvester reaps the grain and little  
 tongues of fire take the rest.        </content>
