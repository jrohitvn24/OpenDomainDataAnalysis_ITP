		<title>12HORTICULTURE IN WITTERINGS</title>
		<content>    The area of land next to the       
 farmland on the coast is used for     
 horticulture.                         
   To help ease the depression and to  
 help to feed the Nation during and    
 after the 1939-45 war the Government  
 set up"The Land Settlement            
 Association".                         
   In West Sussex the Estate was known 
 as The Batchmere Estate,some 139      
 holdings of an average 4 acres per    
 holding.In 1984 the Government sold   
 the holdings,mostly to their sitting  
 tenants.Almost all of the growers got 
 together and formed their own co-oper-
 ative but a few operate individually. 
   Initially,the                       
 crops,tomatoes,celery,lettuce,        
 cucumbers and peppers were grown in   
 Dutch Light Structures but these are  
 gradually being replaced by aluminium 
 "Venlo" type glasshouses.             </content>
