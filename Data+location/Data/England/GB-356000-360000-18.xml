		<title>18TILSTONE PADDOCKS.</title>
		<content>  {Tilstone Paddocks}were originally   
 the stables and cottages belonging to 
{Tilstone House. Mr.R.E.Peacock}bought 
 these and 7 acres of land in 1969 to  
 train his race-horses. He trains for  
 both flat and steeple-chase courses   
 and has met with considerable success.
 To date he has had l75 winners.       
   At the present moment he has twenty 
 two horses in training and is helped  
 by five full-time staff and two part- 
 time workers.                         
   The horses are fed on crushed oats  
 and race-horse nuts, with vitamins E  
 and C added for strengthening muscle  
 and heart.They eat about 15 lbs. of   
 food per day and drink about 9 gallons
 of water.                             
   Mr. Peacock's horses race at most of
 the Courses around the country- Ascot,
 Edinburgh, Chester, etc.
