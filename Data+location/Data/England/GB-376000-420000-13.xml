		<title>13SEWAGE WORKS, HELMSHORE.</title>
		<content>  The sewage works might not sound     
 interesting to you, but it is to other
 people. To get to it you can go       
 through a park called Snig Hole. It is
 a beautiful walk,without much         
 disturbance. After a while you come   
 out into a field.You walk across it   
 and you come to a stile.You cross over
 it and just ahead of you is the sewage
 works. But before you get to it you   
 will smell the soap factory. By now   
 you should have got your handkerchief 
 out. When you get to it the water     
 around it will be black. Then you can 
 go in and pick up some leaflets even  
 if you don't like it, it is a nice    
 walk there and back. And if you like  
 you can have a go on the swings and   
 other things at the park.
