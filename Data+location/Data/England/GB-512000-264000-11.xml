		<content>    The existence of Gt.Staughton is   
 recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086.
 The reference is to the Manor and     
 "...land for sixteen ploughs".        
    The origin of the name{Gt.Staughton
 (Gt.Storton) is probably 'Stockton'- a
 stockaded township- which was the part
 of the Village we now call the 'Town'.
    Gt.Staughton has several fine      
 examples of 16th. &amp; 17th. Century     
 architecture....as in 'Little Thatch' 
 and 'The Chestnuts' (houses on The    
 Highway); the Barn at 'Place House';  
 'Taggart Gallery' and 'White Hart'    
 Public House (old Staging Inns).It is,
 perhaps, symbolic of our fascination  
 for the past that a new development - 
 Lion Court - is based on the design of
 the 'White Hart'.                     
    Along The Highway is a brick-based 
 Sundial dating from 1637 which was    
 possibly once the old Village Cross.  </content>
