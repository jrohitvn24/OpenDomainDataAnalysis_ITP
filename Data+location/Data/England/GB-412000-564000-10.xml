		<title>10THE WILLOWS,RYTON,GATESHEAD.</title>
		<content> Towards{Wylam}we pass the boat club   
 and further along we pass the golf    
 course. There is a cinder track       
 running along the side of the river.  
   People use the Willows for walking, 
 playing, camping, fishing, picnicking,
 boating and water skiing.             
   There are plans being made now for  
 the local government to purchase all  
 land not already owned by them leading
 down to the Willows and towards       
{Newburn Bridge.}The idea is that the  
 Willows will be opened up as a        
 recreation centre with nature trails  
 and fishing and boating facilities.   
 Access will be available from Newburn 
 Bridge where there will be a car park 
 area.                                 
   There is talk of allowing sheep to  
 graze on the land but there have been 
 many objections by dog owners who use 
 the Willows to exercise their dogs.   </content>
