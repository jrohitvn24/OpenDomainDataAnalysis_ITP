		<title>15INTERVIEW WITH SCHOOL COOK</title>
		<content>  Mrs. Delves is our school cook. She  
 has been at our school for 43         
 years.She was here during the Second  
 World War. As there was a shortage    
 the headteacher used to weigh out the 
 ingredients every day so that she     
 didn't waste anything!She has seen    
 lots of headteachers at our school -  
 Mrs. Springham is the first lady      
 head.The first canteen to be opened   
 was in the old Wesleyan Sunday School 
 building.The children were marched    
 over there at dinner times.Mrs. Delves
 had to light coal stoves and collect  
 water in buckets.She had to feed 150  
 evacuees who had been brought from the
 big cities to Lanivet.                
 Today the school kitchen is in the    
 main building.Last week a new potato  
 peeler was fitted.School dinners cost 
 65p each and Mrs. Delves cooks about  
 30 a day.                             </content>
