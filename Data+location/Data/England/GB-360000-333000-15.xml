		<title>15Moreton Wood Farm</title>
		<content>   Moreton Wood Farm is built of bricks
 with a tiled roof,like most of the    
 other farmhouses in the area.The      
 farmer is a tenant farmer who employs 
 1 cowman,1 tractor driver and 1       
 student on a Y.T.S scheme. There are  
 14 fields which grow barley,wheat and 
 grass.The fields have changed through 
 the years because some hedges have    
 been removed.                         
   The 150 Friesian cows are milked    
 twice a day in a herring_bone milking 
 parlour. They are fed on silage during
 the winter. There are also 30 heifers,
 60 calves and 1 bull.                 
   Farm buildings include a grain      
 silo,and two large sheds,in one of    
 which are kept 3 tractors.            
 A family of 6 people live in the      
 farmhouse which has thirteen rooms and
 a large garden.
