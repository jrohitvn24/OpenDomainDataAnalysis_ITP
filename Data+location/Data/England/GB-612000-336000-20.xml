		<title>20HOW WE DID THE SURVEY</title>
		<content>   WE SPENT SEVERAL LESSONS BEFORE WE  
 WENT OUT TO COLLECT THE INFORMATION,  
 ORGANIZING WHO WAS GOING TO DO WHICH  
 SQUARE, THEN WE WERE TOLD WHAT SORT OF
 INFORMATION WE WERE EXPECTED TO       
 COLLECT. WE WERE EACH GIVEN A MAP OF  
 THE AREA, WE HAD DECIDED TO COLLECT   
 ALL THE INFORMATION IN ONE DAY (IN    
 ORDER TO EASE ORGANISATION). SO WE ALL
 SET OFF FOR OUR SQUARES IN GROUPS OF  
 TWO OR THREE. WE SPENT THE WHOLE DAY  
 NOTING THE LAND COVER AND CONDUCTING  
 INTERVIEWS. THAT AFTERNOON WE GOT BACK
 TO SCHOOL. THE LAND COVER AND         
 AMENITIES WERE ENTERED INTO THE       
 COMPUTER. THEN OVER THE NEXT FEW WEEKS
 THE PAGES OF TEXT WERE ENTERED BY THE 
 INDIVIDUAL CONTRIBUTORS.
