		<content> The higher parts of our area are      
 moorland. Underneath them the stone is
 mainly millstone grit. Peat is very   
 common. Some predatory animals live   
 there like stoats, foxes and weasels. 
 Moors are usually situated above the  
 400m counter. Rough pasture is found  
 on the edge of the moors. It is land  
 which the early eighteenth century    
 farmers "brought in"from the moors    
 by draining ploughing and seeding.    
 Most of the rough pasture             
 land is between 300m and 400m above   
 sea level. Farmland is land which is  
 used as silage, hayfields and         
 pastureland. It is usually level.Most 
 of our wildlife is found in the       
 woodland zone the dominant trees of   
 the district are silver birch oak     
 hawthorn beech and sycamore. The      
 towns stretch along the Calder Valley.
