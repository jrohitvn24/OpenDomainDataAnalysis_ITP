		<title>18FELBRIGG CHURCH</title>
		<content>  The church is situated 500 metres    
 from the Hall, and almost 1 kilometre 
 from the village.  It stands on its   
 own, surrounded by fields and pasture.
 War-time ploughing revealed evidence  
 of a settlement around the church.  It
 seems that the village was re-sited so
 as not to spoil the view from the Hall
 when it was built.                    
  The church was largely re-built in   
 the 15th century, and is noted for    
 some very fine{brasses. }The earliest 
 brass is dated 1351 A.D., and depicts 
{Simon de Felbrigg,}his wife Alice and 
 Roger de Felbrigg and his wife.  The  
 best brass is that of{Sir Simon       
{Felbrigg}in full armour, and Lady     
 Felbrigg, dated 1416 A.D.  There are  
 also memorials to other members of the
{Felbrigg}and{Windham}families.        
  The brasses are an added attraction  
 for visitors to Felbrigg Hall.        </content>
