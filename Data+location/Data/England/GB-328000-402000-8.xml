 and a few have hot dinners. Only one  
 or two go home for lunch. We say      
{'Grace'}and go out to play. Mrs.      
 Draper, the{Welfare Assistant,}takes  
 care of us.                           
   At 1.15p.m. we all go for afternoon 
 school. On a Thursday we play netball 
 with{Ince Blundell Village School.

 3.00p.m. when we come in again for our
