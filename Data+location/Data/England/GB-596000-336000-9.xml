		<content>  Children from the village have       
 achieved much, although opportunities 
 are limited. There is a voluntary     
 pre-school playgroup which is held    
 weekly in the village hall.           
  The village primary school housed in 
 a new building is a church foundation.
 It has a high standard and is very    
 popular. Its register consists of     
 thirty village children with a futher 
 thirty from surrounding villages. From
 the age of eleven, children travel to 
 the Alderman Peel High School at Wells
 which is a comprehensive school.      
  To take advantage of further         
 education teenagers and young adults  
 have to travel to Norwich or King's   
 Lynn.                                 
  Library facilities are provided in   
 the form of a mobile library van run  
 by the education authority.
