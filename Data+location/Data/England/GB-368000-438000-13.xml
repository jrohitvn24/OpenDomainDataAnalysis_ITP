		<content>   The major religion in this area is  
 Catholicism.This was strengthened in  
 1792 when Thomas Weld (a former pupil)
 invited the Jesuits to move their     
 College from Liege,in Belgium,to his  
 large house at Stonyhurst.            
   In 1832 the building of St.Peter's  
 began.When it was consecrated in 1835 
 it was among the first                
 post-reformation Catholic churches.It 
 now has two satellite churches, St.   
 Joseph's in Hurst Green and another at
 Dutton Lee.                           
   The Church of England has two       
 churches nearby.St.John's in Hurst    
 Green is just outside our block.All   
 Hallows' church in Mitton is very old.
