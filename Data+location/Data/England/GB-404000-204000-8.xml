		<content>   Living in a small village like      
 Barnsley has its advantages and       
 disadvantages. Being a teenager, I    
 like to go out with my friends. This  
 is sometimes difficult as I have to   
 rely on my parents for a lift. My     
 brother, however, enjoys living here  
 because he can make ' dens' and ride  
 his bicycle safely.                   
   I go to school in Cirencester. I    
 catch a school bus to and from the    
 school which I don't have to pay for  
 because Barnsley is over five miles   
 from the school.I am in the fifth year
 and the subjects I chose to take are: 
 Biology, Chemistry, Physics, German,  
 French and Latin. We all have to do   
 English, Maths and P.E. I do roughly  
 one and a half hours' homework a night
 as well as the five hours' lessons at 
 school.I would like to go to          
 University to study Law.              </content>
