		<content> Since opening in 1971 at Sibson aero- 
 drome over 17,000 people have made be-
 tween them 170,000 descents.  The     
 centre has about 100 members who use  
 two Britten-Norman Islander aircraft  
 with a capacity for 17 jumpers.       
 Two-day courses are run costing about 
 Â£77 depending on time of year.        
 Accommodation and facilities for camp-
 ing and caravans are available.       
 Course consists of 10 hours intensive 
 ground training including five periods
 of landing practice using swing and   
 fan trainers.  The club is the only   
 civilian one to use fan trainers, both
 vertical and horizontal, the latter   
 proving to give most realistic        
 landing. Course includes one jump from
 an aircraft.  Most of the parachute   
 jumps are made for charity.
