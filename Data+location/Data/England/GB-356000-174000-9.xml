{SS PETER AND PAUL SUMMER FAYRE}       
 At the fayre we did a gymnastic       
 display we did  some forward rolls    
 through hoops and neckspring off the  
 box and a few other things.We did it  
 outside in the playground on the      
 mats There was another game where the 
 Headmaster put his head through a hole
 and you could throw wet sponges at him
 which was good.Another game was the   
 slippery pole.Two people sat on the   
 pole an had to try hit each other off 
 with a cushion if you fell off you    
 fell onto some mats.
