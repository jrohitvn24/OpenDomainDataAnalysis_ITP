 The church is situated in the centre  
 of the village. It was built in 1851. 
{Hillesley Baptist Church.}Usually     
 called the chapel it was founded in   
 1730 and comprises the main chapel    
 with a classroom attatched for Sunday 
 school use.                           
{St. Kenelm Church, Alderley, C of E.} 
 The church is beside the former manor 
 house (now Rose Hill School). The     
 tower of the church is thought to be  
 much older than the main body of the  
 church. It is likely the church was   
 founded in the mid 13th. century.     
{Tresham Church, C of E.}This is a     
 small church on a hill, it was not    
 dedicated to any saint. The church was
 built in Victorian times on the site  
 of an earlier church. It was          
 rennovated in 1908.
