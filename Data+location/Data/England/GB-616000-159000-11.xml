		<content>  Here first impressions are clinical: 
the corridors and initial smell give   
the impression of a hospital. Overalls 
and head  cover are compulsary for all 
workers and visiters. A total of 270   
people work here, mainly women, of whom
9 are managerial staff. The 24 hour    
shifts are operated from 4am Sunday to 
4pm Friday, each shift lasting 8 hours.
  In 1985 by far the most popular types
of bread are the high-fibre loaves. The
area covered by delivery of foods      
produced by this depot covers all Kent 
and parts of Sussex as far East as     
Eastbourne.                            
  Rate of pay is low, 2 pounds per hour
for shop floor personnel but there is  
ample opportunity for overtime.        
Managerial pay ranges from 8-16,000    
pounds per annum. Normal holiday is 3  
weeks plus Bank holidays               
                                       </content>
