      On the other site there is a     
 playing field and the remainder of the
 school housed in temporary buildings. 
  These are made up of a hall, two     
 classrooms and a kitchen.   There is  
 also a third classroom housed in a    
 'mobile'.   In addition there is an   
 outdoor swimming pool with changing   
 rooms built using money raised by     
 parents of children at the school.    
      In July 1985 there were 149      
 children attending the school         
 organised into five classes.   The    
 children enter the school at the      
 beginning of the term in which they   
 become five years old and stay until  
 they are eleven when they transfer to 
 The Stonehenge School in Amesbury.
