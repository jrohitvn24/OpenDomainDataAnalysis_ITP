		<title>10The Sewage Works</title>
		<content> We decided that it was important  to  
 discover just how the houses in our   
 area were supported,by the use of{    
{Science and Technology}in providing   
 services for us.                      
 We were able to find out about the    
 sub-stations for electricity etc,but  
 the thing which we were fascinated    
 by,was the sewage works.              
 At first it was difficult to arraonge 
 a visit,but{Mr.Lees}said that we could
 make a trip there.It is situated in   
 Little Oakley,and is surrounded by    
 fields,many of which grew{experimental
{plants,}to find new types of cereals. 
 We saw where the sewage came in,how it
 was sifted,and then how it was sprayed
 onto the clinker where it degrades.The
 slurry is separated,the treated water 
 runs into the{river,}while the waste  
 solid settles.When it is full the     
 lagoon is emptied onto the land.      </content>
