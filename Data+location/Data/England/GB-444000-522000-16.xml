		<title>16Billingham Ice Skating Rink</title>
		<content> Every Saturday I go ice skating to the
 Forum Ice Rink at 10.00. My mam or dad
 takes me. I have my own boots and i   
 wear a tracksuit. I have 9 NSA        
 (National Skating Association) badges.
 I have one jump to learn before I     
 start double and triple loots. I have 
 a private lesson of 15 minutes. I am  
 learning the sit-spin, where you go   
 down on one leg into a little ball,   
 and the parallel spin, where you go   
 round with one leg out and one leg on 
 the ground. I practise and then go    
 home at 11.30. It is nice to jump in  
 the air and land without falling over.
 Ice shows are staged at Christmas and 
 there are seats for over 1000 people. 
 The ice rink has a successful ice     
 hockey team which travels around the  
 country playing matches.
