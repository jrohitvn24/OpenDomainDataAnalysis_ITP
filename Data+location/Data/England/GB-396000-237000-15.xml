		<title>15HOME LIFE</title>
		<content>   There are many different styles of  
 home life in the villages of the South
 Eastern area of{Bredon Hill.}The      
 villages are knitted together by      
 outside activities, which are very    
 well supported, such as the W.I.,     
 Mothers Union, Wives Group, Over 60's 
 Club, The Tuesday Club and the very   
 talented Drama Group.                 
   Most people take pride in their     
 gardens and some have them open to the
 public several times a year, to raise 
 money for various charities.          
   Most housewives take a pride in good
 cooking, some make bread, others ice  
 and decorate cakes to a very high     
 standard.                             
   Children mostly attend local schools
 but a few attend private schools in   
 the nearby towns. Boarding at school  
 is however very rare in these days.
