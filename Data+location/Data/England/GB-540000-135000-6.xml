		<title>06THE POLICE AND THE PUBLIC</title>
		<content>                                       
 The Police are satisfied with their   
 relationship with the public.Public   
 support is good and there is little   
 serious crime.It is believed that a   
 lot of police work is too impersonal  
 and that the "bobby on the beat"      
 system has much going for it.However, 
 car patrols are quicker.The Police are
 concerned with the behaviour of       
 youngsters. 80% of all crime in our   
 area is committed by youths under     
 18.Shop-lifting and assault are linked
 with this age group.Under-age         
 drinking is also a cause for          
 concern.The Police recently launched a
 Good Neighbour Crime Watch scheme in  
 the area.The idea is to prevent crime 
 rather than have to solve it.
