		<title>02New Forest Ponies.</title>
		<content>   Visitors to the{New Forest}will soon
 discover one of the attractions of the
 area.Throughout the forest you will   
 observe ponies roaming around.These   
 ponies belong to people called "{New  
{Forest Commoners}".These are people   
 with the right to graze their animals 
 on the open forest.                   
   The{New Forest Ponies}are a hardy   
 breed, who are used to staying out in 
 the open in all weathers and          
 throughout the year . Between March   
 and July the foals are born,with most 
 of them arriving in May.During the    
 summer months visitors to the area can
 be found taking many pictures of the  
 foals and their mothers,but it is     
 dangerous to approach the rear of a   
 pony as they have a very powerful     
 kick.Unfortunately each year many     
 pones also become victims of road     
 accidents.                            </content>
