		<title>13Abbots Down and Jews Wood</title>
		<content> Abbots Down and Jews Wood are mostly  
 deciduous trees.  The trees are       
 largely{sweet chestnut and beech      
 trees. In the distance the trees were 
 conifers.  The conifers were young    
 fir trees.  The fir trees were fenced 
 off from the rest of the wood.  The   
{tracks}were wide because tractors     
 used them to clear the wood out.      
 However there seemed to be far more   
 tracks in the wood than were needed.  
 From hoof marks we could tell that    
 the wood is also used for{riding.} The
 wood had been looked after when the   
 chestnut wood was taken out to use for
 fencing:  we could tell because of    
 the coppicing which had taken place.  
 There are fallen trees and plenty of  
 undergrowth, and some muddy and       
 treacherous tracks, so in 1985 it     
 seems that the wood needs looking     
 after a bit better.                   </content>
