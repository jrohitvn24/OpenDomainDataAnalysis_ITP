		<content> I like my school because we go        
 swimming and have Sports days. I liked
 Sports Day. In 1984 the yellows won.  
 On June 9th 1985 for our outing we are
 going to{Beamish,}the year before     
 that we went to{Warkworth Castle} and 
 we went to the beach. I like going on 
 school trips. On Thursday we play     
 Netball. We have matches against other
 schools. Sometimes we go to the       
 theatre. When we are doing plays we go
 to the Drama Centre to practice. Mr   
 Wilson is our teacher; my favourite   
 lesson is Maths. I like Maths; we do  
 it nearly every day.{Seaton Burn First
{School}is older than 100 years. We    
 have eight teachers in this school    
 Mrs. Ferguson, Mrs. Greenwood,        
 Mrs. Hester, Mr. Byrne, Mrs. Rees,    
 Mr. Wilson, Mrs Archibald and         
 Mrs. Stobbs. I am not looking forward 
 to going to the Middle School.        </content>
