		<title>08Sports Day</title>
		<content> Every year Chandag Junior School has a
{sports}day.It is usually held at the  
 end of June.This year we were very    
 lucky with the weather but it was very
 hot so that made it quite hard to race
 .All the events were open to all years
 except the{chariot}race and the mum's{
{skipping}race and the dad's{sack.}Each
 child races for their team_Willow,    
 Hawthorn,Rowan or Sycamore.If you do  
 come first,second,third or fourth,you 
 get some team points which they write 
 on a board and keep track of until the
 end of Sports Day.Then the winning    
 team is presented with a shield which 
 this year Willow won.We race on a     
 field,the mums and dads come to watch.
 The first years have an{egg and spoon}
 race,the second years have a{three- } 
{legged}race,while the third and fourth
 years have{sack}races and{skipping.
