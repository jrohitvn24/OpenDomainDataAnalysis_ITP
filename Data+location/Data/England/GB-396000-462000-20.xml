		<title>20ART IN UPPER WHARFEDALE</title>
		<content>{Upper Wharfedale,}because it is an    
 area of outstanding natural beauty,   
 situated in limestone countryside and 
 bisected by the{River Wharfe}attracts 
 many artists, both local and from much
 further afield.                       
 Tiny hamlets and villages dot the area
 and most of the buildings are old and 
 so they offer great potential for the 
 professional and the amateur artist   
 who is seeking either financial reward
 or simply personal satisfaction.      
 There are many outlets for artistic   
 works,especially during the summer    
 when tourists arrive and so there are 
 a number of{Art Festivals}over these  
 months.Here work is displayed from    
 both the professional and the amateur.
