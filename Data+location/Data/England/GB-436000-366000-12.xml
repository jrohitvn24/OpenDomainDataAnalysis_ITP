		<title>12'GREEN BELT'LAND,WINGERWORTH</title>
		<content>  The main topic of conversation in    
 Wingerworth is{the controversial plan 
{to build on the North-East Derbyshire 
{Green Belt land. }This is an area of  
 agricultural land, which in 1984, was 
 established as an area for            
 preservation.  Not only is it a home  
 for wildlife, but it also separates   
 Wingerworth from the rest of          
 Chesterfield.                         
  The field in question is owned by the
{Coop.,}they rent it out to a local    
 farmer for grazing land.  But they now
 want to  sell it to{Adlingtons,}the   
 builders.                             
  The feeling against the proposed     
 development is so strong that a       
 petition signed by the majority of    
 residents was presented to{Coop.}and  
{Adlingtons}at a{public meeting}held to
 discuss the matter.  No decision has  
 yet been made.                        </content>
