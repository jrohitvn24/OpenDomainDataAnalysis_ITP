		<title>05RURAL TRANSPORT</title>
		<content> The area surveyed has virtually no    
{public transport.                     
                                       
 Long distance{buses}and{coaches}use   
 the nearby A5 road but there are no   
 services to the villages.             
                                       
 Most people have a{car.} Those that do
 not have to rely on{taxis}or{walking. 
                                       
 Where there are bus services, the     
 elderly, those over 60, can often     
 travel for only 10 pence.  Local      
 Authorities pay an annual subsidy to  
 bus companies to cover the            
 consessionary fares.                  
                                       
 People are very concerned about plans 
 to split up the{National Bus Company. 
 Privatisation in this way will,it is  
 feared, reduce rural services even    
 more.                                 </content>
