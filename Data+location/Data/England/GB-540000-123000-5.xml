		<title>05A FLETCHING OCTAGENARIAN(2)</title>
		<content> He has been a voluntary worker at the 
 Bluebell Line since 1959 and loves    
 steam trains.                         
  In the Second World War he belonged  
 to the Civil Defence and was awarded a
 medal for sighting a V1 Rocket that   
 came  over Fletching.                 
 At 83 he still plays the organ        
 regularly and every morning sets off  
 on his bike to deliver the Royal Mail 
 as he is the local postman.           
 He remembers the first car in the     
 village, owned by the doctor and      
 himself owned one of the first        
 wirelesses (cat's whiskers)           
 He remembers the bus fare to Uckfield 
 being 8d but now it is Â£1.10.         
 Even so he prefers life today_likes   
 T.V. (makes life much more interesting
 ) and all the new_fangled gadgets but 
 not computers.
