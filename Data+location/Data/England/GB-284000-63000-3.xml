		<content> Marldon has many organisations.       
 The{sporting}ones are cricket         
 club, football and tennis clubs.      
 The{football}club is called Marldon   
 Spurs and plays on a field above Hills
 Quarry. The field is used as pasture  
 land during the rest of the week. The 
 team plays in local leagues.          
 The{cricket}club has been going for   
 two years. Matches are held in the    
 Meadow,by the Church House Inn.       
 Mr.Parry is the captain. The club     
 has made a cricket square and put up a
 fence to protect the Council Houses.  
 The{tennis}club has started in the    
 hope that tennis courts will be built 
 in Marldon. At present members play on
 courts in holiday camps out of our map
 area. Most sports people go out of the
 area to Paignton or Torquay to play.
