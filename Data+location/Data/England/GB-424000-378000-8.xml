		<content> There are refreshments, Red Cross and 
 St. Johns Ambulance Brigade, a        
 playground and various stalls to      
 refresh ones concentration on the main
 event. On the Sunday before the       
 trials, a special prayer is said in   
 the hope that sunshine will prevail   
 throughout the trials. The Longshaw   
 Sheepdog Trials Association also      
 serves to support local charities, and
 Trials nationally are increasing in   
 popularity due to recent television   
 coverage. This summer's weather has   
 been very poor, and although the sky  
 remained fairly clear this year, many 
 competitors were forced to retire due 
 to persistent winds, which obliterated
 the commands of the shepherds, but    
 could not deter that special          
 atmosphere created by watching man and
 his dog at work.
