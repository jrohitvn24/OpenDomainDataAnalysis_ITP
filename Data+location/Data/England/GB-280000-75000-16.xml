 has its own{Pottery}to make{dishes}and
{pommanders.}They use a plastic clay.

 is the clay mixed with water and added
 chemicals. Then they pour the clay    
 into plaster moulds and it is left    
 there to dry. It is then{fettled}which
 means the seams are removed using a   
 knife. It is then sponged off. The    
 pottery is then{bisque fired}which is 
 the first firing done to the shaped   
 clay. Then it is{glazed}which involves
 dipping the bisqueware in finely      
 ground glass mixed with water and     
 stains. Then they overspray which is  
 generally a contrasting colour. The   
 pottery is then{glost fired}to produce
 the finished items. The pottery is    
 then checked for flaws and graded     
 firsts seconds and rejects.
