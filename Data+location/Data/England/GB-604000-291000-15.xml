		<title>15ALL SAINTS CHURCH</title>
		<content> All Saints Old Buckenham is an unusual
 church because it has a thatched roof 
 and an octagonal tower from the       
 foundations upwards.  There are some  
 pieces of Norman architecture still   
 standing in this church, which is     
 probably built on the site of a       
 previous one. In the moulding of the  
 chancel arch are four carved stone    
 faces, two of which are thought to be 
 Queen Adelicia, widow of Henry I, and 
 William d'Albini, the Norman baron who
 built the castle near New Buckenham   
 and the Priory.  The portraits were   
 probably carved in the late 14th      
 century.                              
 There is a memorial to Major William  
 Keppel and his wife in the choir      
 stalls, which forms a link with their 
 relatives, the Earls of Albemarle, in 
 one of Old Buckenham's sister         
 parishes, Quidenham.                  </content>
