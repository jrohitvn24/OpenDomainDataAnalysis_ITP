		<title>06Guides in Wrecclesham</title>
		<content> Every Tuesday the{Wrecclesham Guides  
 meet at Leverton Hall between 6.45pm  
 and 8.15pm.Each week every guide pays 
 30p for the use of 1 kitchen,toilets, 
 and hall.On  average 17 guides attend.
 There are 4 patrols.Each year the     
 guides go to{summer camp.}It costs    
 between Â£19.30 and Â£30.00.This pays   
 for the hire of the tents and the     
 price of the food and sometimes the   
 hire of canoes.This year there are    
 a lot more events because it is the   
{75th anniversary of Guiding.}We have  
 had two celebration parties.At Guides 
 they do a different selection of      
 things.Sometimes they do games or     
 crafts.On other weeks they have       
 disscusions and they plan for the next
 term.
