		<title>12 Canada,West Wellow.</title>
		<content>Canada is part of Wellow.The majority  
of residents do not think that the A36 
splits the community from the rest of  
Wellow.                                
  Building must have started in the    
early C.19th.The earliest building we  
recorded was the"Rockingham Arms"      
public house,built in 1840.The houses  
are mainly Victorian with eight rooms  
and two acres gardens.                 
  The modern buildings,mostly          
bungalows,were built between 1950 and  
1970.They have aprox.one third of an   
acre of garden.Canada is so called     
because the workers on Embley Estate   
decided to move,the more adventurous   
people emigrated to Canada(N.America). 
The poorer people bought plots of land 
(plantations)from the Duchess of       
Chandra and built on them.This was     
their "Canada" and the name stuck.
