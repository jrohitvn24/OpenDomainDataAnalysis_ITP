		<content>It is estimated that half the popul-   
ation (around 200) of this valley      
commute to neighbouring towns such as  
Dartford for employment. The remainder 
are mainly exployed in agriculture,    
horticulture,Kennels(greyhound racing  
&amp; boarding)horse-riding establishments,
mushroom farming and a packaging firm. 
These employ less than ten people each.
The larger establishments such as the  
Country Club(up to 50),clinic, light   
engineering firms and Brands Hatch     
circuit employ more. Private housing   
dominates the area but close to the    
centre a crescent of old peoples bung- 
alows and ten council houses are       
situated. The old age pensioners bung- 
alows were recently filled by people   
from Croydon &amp; Dagenham after being    
refused by people from the area.60     
Council houses have been built adjacent
to the Saxon burial ground.            </content>
