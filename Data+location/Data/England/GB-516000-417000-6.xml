		<title>06A Smallholding</title>
		<content> George Tuplin farms a small strip of  
 land along Station Road. This         
 smallholding is a  strange sight in an
 area which is mainly indndustry. The  
 smallholding of{9 acres}is a mixture  
 of things. Near the house George keeps
 his{livestock.}He has 3 cows which he 
 buys young at local markets,fattens   
 them up before slaughtering them for  
 sale or his families use. His 100+ {  
{chickens}roam freely about the        
 farmyard and provide {eggs for sale to
{local people.}In early summer George  
 buys{turkey chicks}to fatten for Xmas 
 sale. His other animals include{geese 
{and pigs.}In the fields he produces { 
{hay for winter feed }and grows a few {
{vegetables.}In the future George hopes
 to increase the number of animals and 
 become more self_sufficient in food.  
 He would like to rebuild the barns.
