		<title>10A Day at Newton Toney</title>
		<content> While we walked down the road we saw  
 an old cottage that looked as though  
 nobody lived in it . Then we passed   
 the local which is called the {Mallet 
{Arms.}It is named after some rich     
 people in Newton Toney. When we got to
{Newton Toney school}we met the        
 headmaster and churchwarden. We       
 interviewed the children at the       
 school,then we looked around the      
 village. It has one {Post Office }and 
 Stores which is just opposite the     
 bridge over the {River Bourne.}There  
 is a church in Newton Toney dedicated 
 to {St.Andrew.}In Newton Toney most of
 the houses are cottages in the main   
 part of Newton Toney.The railway runs 
 to the north east of Newton           
 Toney.There are about 30 people in    
 Newton Toney School.
