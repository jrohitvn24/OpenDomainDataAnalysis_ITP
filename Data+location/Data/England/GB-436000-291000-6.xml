 other useful things. We have two      
 patrols, Kingfisher and Robin. We also
 go on camp where we live in tents and 
 do our own cooking.                   
                                       
{Passport to Leisure                   
 In Nuneaton, we have a scheme called  
 Passports to leisure. Children pay    
 Â£1.50 and are given a plastic card    
 with their photograph and number on.  
 We can use this to get into places    
 like the swimming baths,tennis courts 
 and sports centres free of charge.    
    Adults can also have a Passport.   
 They cannot get into places free but  
 can book courts an advance free of    
 charge and sometimes they get into    
 things cheaper.                       
    We have 3 Leisure Centres in       
 Nuneaton - The Pingles,Etone and the  
 Jubilee Centre.                       </content>
