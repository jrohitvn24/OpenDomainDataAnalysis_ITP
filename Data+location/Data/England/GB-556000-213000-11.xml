		<title>11Leaden Roding Fire Station 2</title>
		<content> The fire engine currently being used  
 at Leaden Roding is a 1972 Dennis     
 Water Tender powered by a Jaguar 4.2  
 litre six cylinder petrol engine.     
 Leaden Roding Fire Station is         
 currently manned by 10 Retained       
 Firemen,each having regular jobs and  
 only attending the fire station for   
 training,esential maintenance work and
 in response to fire calls. They are   
 called out to fire calls by the       
 Brigade Fire Control at Hutton,using a
 radio transmitter to set off pocket   
 alerters carried by the firemen. The  
 location of the fire is recorded on a 
 tape machine at the station and is    
 played back when the firemen arrive.  
 The station at Leaden Roding attends  
 approximately 50 calls a year,the     
 majority of these calls being to give 
 assistance to neighbouring stations.
