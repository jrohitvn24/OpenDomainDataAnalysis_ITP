		<title>15ROADS, HAMPTON WICK</title>
		<content> Many of the roads in{Hampton Wick}    
 area are mainly residential and fairly
 quiet, apart from the busy Kingston   
 Road.  The houses are mainly detached 
 or semi-deatched and have small       
 gardens.  Some houses have the River  
 Thames at the end of the garden and   
 some even have a boat moored on the   
 river.  Some of the roads are tree    
 lined.  All of them have street lights
 and cars are often parked along the   
 sides of the road.  Close by in most  
 of the roads there is usually a pillar
 box and a telephone box.
