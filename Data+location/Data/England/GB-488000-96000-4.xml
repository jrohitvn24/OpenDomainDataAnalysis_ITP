		<title>04PAGHAM HARBOUR</title>
		<content> At Pagham Harbour we saw a small      
 island 100 metres off the shore.  It  
 was about 150 metres long and at one  
 end there was a little hill built up  
 of silted sand.  At first the entrance
 to the harbour was not visible, but   
 nearer the sea we saw the entrance    
 with water gushing out very fast.     
                                       
 Pagham Harbour has changed over the   
 years.  Because the beach is mostly   
 made of sand, the sea has changed the 
 shape of the shoreline and harbour.   
 The harbour has silted up, forming    
 large banks of sand which make it     
 almost impossible for a boat to enter 
 the harbour.  The entrance was        
 deliberately blocked in 1875, but this
 was washed away in a storm in 1910. At
 one time Pagham Harbour was the 9th   
 busiest port in the country.  Now only
 a small boat can get in.              </content>
