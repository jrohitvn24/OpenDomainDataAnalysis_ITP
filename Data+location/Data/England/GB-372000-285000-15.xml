		<title>15SEVERN VALLEY RAILWAY</title>
		<content> The Severn Valley Railway is a        
 full-size standard-gauge line running 
 regular steam-hauled passenger trains 
 for the use of tourists.It runs from  
 Bridgnorth to Kidderminster and stops 
 at 6 stations including Hampton Loade.
     The line closely follows the River
 Severn and makes the journey a very   
 picturesque one indeed.               
     Services run at weekends from the 
 beginning of March until the end of   
 October,at Bank Holidays,during the   
 whole of Spring Bank Holiday week,and 
 every day during peak holiday weeks.  
     There are some full time workers  
 employed but much of the work is      
 undertaken by volunteers giving up    
 their spare time to help preserve the 
 line.
