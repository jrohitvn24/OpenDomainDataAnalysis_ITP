		<title>08The Explosion!</title>
		<content> One Friday night in February 1977, a  
 strong smell of gas was noticed in{   
{Astley Road}and the Gas Board were    
 called out but could find nothing. At 
 2 am on Saturday there was a terrific 
 explosion. A house across the road was
 burning furiously. The{emergency      
{services}arrived and worked all       
 through the night clearing up. The    
 street was evacuated and the families 
 were cared for in{the Salvation Army} 
 premises where they were given hot    
 drinks. One old lady who lived nearby 
 stayed all the time making tea for the
 policemen and firemen.The family whose
 house had exploded stayed with        
 relatives for some time afterwards.   
 Every gas pipe in Astley Road had to  
 be renewed which took months to       
 complete. No-one will forget that     
 night in a hurry! This information    
 came from Clare's Mum.                </content>
