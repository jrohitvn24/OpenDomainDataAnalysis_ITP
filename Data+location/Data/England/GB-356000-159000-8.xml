		<title>08BISHOP SUTTON PARISH CHURCH</title>
		<content> Due to the need to raise Â£30,000 for  
 essential repairs to Holy Trinity     
 Church, an appeal was conducted and a 
 village meeting held in church on 9th 
 July. The Archdeacon presided,and the 
 Rural Dean, the Vicar the Rev. John   
 Higgins, and 38 parishioners attended.
 Of 370 letters sent,149 positive and  
 42 negative replies were returned. To 
 date, gifts received and donations    
 promised for the first year, amount to
 Â£2,235 with a further Â£887 due from   
 covenants. Altogether 40% of the      
 village have pledged their support for
 the Parish Church. At a further       
 meeting on 15th July 1985 the P.C.C.  
 although concerned that funds         
 availablle were only 10% of the total 
 needed, decided to go ahead with      
 essential work to gutters,downpipes &amp; 
 soakaways, provided reasonable        
 estimates could be obtained.          </content>
