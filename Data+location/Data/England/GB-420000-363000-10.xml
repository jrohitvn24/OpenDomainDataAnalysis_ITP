		<title>10SHOPS AND SHOPPING</title>
		<content> In our village there are six food     
 shops, a post office, a newsagent and 
 a hardwareshop. A quarter of the      
 people in Youlgrave go to Bakewell    
 market weekly, a tenth go fortnightly,
 a few go monthly and half go very     
 occasionally. Approximately a third of
 the familes shop for food in the      
 village, half the familes go to a     
 supermarket and other shops elsewhere.
 Bakewell is the most popular place for
 shopping with Matlock in second place 
 and about a tenth go to Chesterfield  
 and a tenth go to Buxton. Three       
 quarters of the familes shop weekly   
 for food. Nearly every family in the  
 village has a fridge and 66% use a    
 deep freeze. Outside delivery food    
 services to houses include fishmonger,
 greengrocer, pork butcher, flour      
 merchant, soft drinks and ice cream.
