		<title>10Mrs.Roberts-Bookbinder.</title>
		<content> There is one old craft still being    
 carried on in Cheriton.Five of us     
 from Cheriton School visited          
 Mrs.Roberts,who is a bookbinder.      
 Mrs.Roberts did four years            
 training at Southampton University    
 before she got her bookbinders        
 certificate.We saw many beautiful     
 books she had made.We saw that each   
 book is made up of lots of sections   
 each section being of three or four   
 pages.A special sewing frame is used  
 to sew lots of sections together at   
 the spine of the book.                
           We all made bookmarks with  
 our name on in gold.We had to put each
 letter on individually,using real gold
 foil.The bookmakers tool has to be    
 heated first and pushed down very hard
 on the foil to leave a gold letter    
 behind.                               
                                       </content>
