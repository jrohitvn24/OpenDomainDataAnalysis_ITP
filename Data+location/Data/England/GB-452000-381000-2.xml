		<title>02The Chesterfield Canal</title>
		<content> The{Chesterfield Canal,}which crosses 
 our block from east to west,was built 
 in{1777}by{James Brindley.}It was     
 closed in{1908}because the{Norwood    
{tunnel}fell in and stopped boats from 
 going through our block.The canal runs
 along side the railway.The canal      
 ran from{Chesterfield}to the{River    
{Trent.}It runs through the hamlet of  
{Turnerwood}which was built at the same
 time as the canal.The canal was built 
 to get brick,stone and coal from      
{Chesterfield}to the{River Trent.}The  
 canal towpath is used for nice long   
 walks.The canal is full of reeds and  
 some people are trying to re-open it  
 to let boats through our block.The    
 main problem of re-opening the canal  
 is that they would have to put gates  
 on all the locks.The canal is 7 feet  
 wide at the locks.The locks are in    
 ruins.                                </content>
