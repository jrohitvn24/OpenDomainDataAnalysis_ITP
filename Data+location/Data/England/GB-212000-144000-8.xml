		<title>08Farming on Lundy.</title>
		<content> Lundy is like one big farm-with the   
 best of the grazing land in the south.
 The livestock are: 350-400 ewes,20-30 
 rams and 400-500 lambs;38 beef cattle 
 and one dairy cow;6 ponies,5 foals and
 a stallion(recenly brought from the   
 mainland).Some of the people that live
 on the island have their own goats and
 chickens.There are also deer and Soay 
 sheep which roam wild and are culled  
 occasionally to keep numbers down.    
 Last year they started to put up      
 electric fences to protect the stone  
 walls -eventually they will have 20   
 miles of electric fencing.            
 There are 4 tractors,a Land Rover and 
 a bulldozer,but these are not only    
 used for farming.There is also a horse
 drawn cart. Recently the farm         
 buildings and facilities have been    
 much improved but the farm only aims  
 to break even.    {Matthew Jones.     </content>
