		<title>09DARRINGTON FEAST AND FAYRE</title>
		<content> Our band was the only jazz band at the
{Darrington Feast and Fayre on Saturday
{13th.July 1985.}We marched from the   
 Darrington Hotel to the field opposite
 Darrington Church where we did a      
 display for visitors to the Fayre.    
 When we weren't performing we went    
 round the stalls and some of us took  
 part in the races.{Once the Fayre was 
{for villagers only but nowadays there 
{are many visitors and many more       
{attractions}including old-fashioned   
 cars,photography,model horse-drawn    
 carriages,a B.M.X. display and a      
 fairground organ.Round the edge of the
 field were stalls with jumble sales,  
 games and items such as teddy-bears   
 and pottery for sale.It is a          
 tradition for the villagers to dress  
 in old fashioned clothes.While we were
 there we visited the church and sang  
 songs with the vicar.                 </content>
