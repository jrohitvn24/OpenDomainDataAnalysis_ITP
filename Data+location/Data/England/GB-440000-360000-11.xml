		<title>11TIBSHELF CARNIVAL</title>
		<content> Every year in July we have a carnival 
 in Tibshelf. This year it is going to 
 be on the Cricket Field. Sometimes it 
 is held on Brown's Field.             
 The carnival procession starts at     
 Hawthorne Avenue and goes along       
 Chesterfield Road and down High Street
 to the Cricket Field.                 
 My nephew Craig is entering the fancy 
 dress competition. He is going as an  
 Indian. My sister is entering her dog 
 Prince in the pet show. She said she  
 is entering him in the obedience test.
 I am entering Prince in the looks     
 competition.                          
 A fair comes to the village a few days
 before Carnival Day to get people in  
 the mood for the big day. On the first
 day they open all the rides are free. 
 Last year I won a goldfish at the     
 fair.
