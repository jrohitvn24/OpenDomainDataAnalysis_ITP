		<title>04Mistley Church, Manningtree</title>
		<content> There were three churches dedicated to
 St.Mary. Mistley Towers was the second
 one (only the medieval porch remains  
 of the first). It was built in 1735.  
  The nave built between the two towers
 has been destroyed and the surviving  
 towers are now used as a navagation   
 aid.                                  
  Because this was pulled down another 
 church was built (1870-71),which has a
 spire of 140 feet.This is a joint     
 parish church and re-named St.Marys   
 with St.Michaels.                     
  The rector, Mr.C.Noyce lives on the  
 Barrat Estate.The church supports many
 things including a Thursday Club and  
 Youth Club.
