		<content>Our church is a Church of England      
church.It is called Christ Church      
Glasson Dock. The vicar is called Mr.A.
Rimmer. The church has a big organ.It  
has one bell in the tower.It has just  
one tower with about ten windows in it.
Mr.Rimmer is not a full-time clergyman.
Part of his work is acting chaplain at 
the Royal Lancaster Infirmary.         
Surrounding the church is the          
graveyard. The grave-digger is called  
Mr.Wood. Some of the gravestones are   
over 130 years old.                    
The church is only tiny but people who 
visit Glasson Dock say it is very      
pretty.
