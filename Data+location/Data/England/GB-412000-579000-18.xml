		<title>18FIELD SPORTS AROUND WHALTON</title>
		<content> Being essentially a farming community,
 field sports flourish. The local fox_ 
 hounds,{The Morpeth Hunt,}are very    
 well supported and currently have, at 
 least, 200 members actively involved  
 and a flourishing Supporter's Club.   
 Many of the men enjoy shooting and    
 this is largly{game shooting,}not     
 clay. Pheasant,partridge,duck,hares   
 and rabbits are the quarry. There are 
 three good shoot syndicates and a game
 farm in this area and several small   
 rough shoots.{Fishing}is confined to  
 trout only and is not of much         
 consequence here even in the Wansbeck 
 river. However, the source of the     
 Wansbeck at Sweethope lough is now a  
 prolific trout lake, well stocked and 
 well patronised.
