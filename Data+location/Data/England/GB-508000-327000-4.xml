		<content> This is the edge of{fenland}through   
 which small watercourses flow and are 
 pumped to sea.Land is mainly arable,  
 growing corn,sugarbeet,oilseed rape,  
 potatoes and onions.There are few     
 footpaths,some hedges of oak,ash and  
 willow and small copses providing an  
 abundance of fungi.The roadside edges 
 have various grasses and common wild  
 flowers.Birdlife consists of common   
 species including barn owl,pheasant,  
 partridge and winter migrants with    
 occasional sparrowhawks and magpies.  
 Animal life includes rats,fieldmice,  
 shrews,stoats,foxes,rabbits,hares and,
 occasionally,grey squirrels and       
 weasels.Common butterflies,bees,wasps 
 and ladybirds are also present.A few  
 plastic sacks litter fields and       
 verges.Due to public opinion,stubble  
 burning has been limited but chemical 
 crop spraying still causes concern.   </content>
