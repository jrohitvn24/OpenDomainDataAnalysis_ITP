		<title>05EMPLOYMENT - NEWTOWN</title>
		<content>   Employment in this area is not that 
 good.  Most of the people work in     
 shops or do cleaning jobs.  Some of   
 the people work in factories because  
 there are a few factories in this     
 area.  Young students who have been   
 kicked out of college or university   
 and do not get proper jobs work in    
 shops in the town centre or in the    
 little shops at the end of the roads. 
 They are desparate for money and will 
 take any job they are offered.        
   Most people in this area are lucky  
 and get jobs in the offices and then  
 become very important while others    
 struggle for jobs and meanwhile live  
 on 'junk' food.  Most things have     
 become very expensive now and some    
 people cannot afford them when others 
 can. In our area most have poor jobs  
 and do not have enough money to pay   
 their expenses. by Sarbjit Kaur.      </content>
