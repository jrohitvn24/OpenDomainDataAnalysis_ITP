		<content> We did a survey which shows that less 
 than 3% of the population of          
 Dinnington and its immediate area took
 part in any form of worship. Of these 
 there was a slight majority who       
 attended the{Church of England.}We    
 also found that there was a place     
 where{Pentecostalists}met to pray.    
 There were also individual{Jehovah's  
{Witnesses}but this did not alter our  
 finding that Dinnington  is not really
 a religious place.                    
 A lot of{weddings}take place (about   
 150 a year) and a high number of      
{funerals}(about 300 a year in a       
 population of under 8000) which shows 
 that Dinnington has a high percentage 
 of old people. There is a strong youth
 club in the{Methodist Church}as well  
 as a Tuesday Bible group. There is    
 also a strong{Salvation Army}group but
 no Citadel.                           </content>
