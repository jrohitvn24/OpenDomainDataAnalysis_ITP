		<title>16SHOPPING IN BAPCHILD</title>
		<content>   Bapchild is a small village located 
 on the A2 one mile east of Sitting-   
 bourne. Shopping facilities are       
 limited but two stores deserve        
 mention.                              
   Bapchild Farm Stall is a small shop 
 on a prime site by the A2. It offers  
 parking space to drivers wishing to   
 purchase goods. The shop sells fruit  
 and vegetables, much of which is      
 produced by the local farms owned by  
 Mr Gascoyne. Open daily, the shop is  
 very busy most of the time, especially
 in June when it is selling            
 strawberries.                         
   Bapchild Stores is also situated on 
 the A2 but on the opposite side of the
 road. The shop contains the sub-post  
 office for the area. At the moment the
 shop is owned by Mr Townsend whose    
 son attends the school.
