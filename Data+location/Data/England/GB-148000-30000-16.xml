		<title>16HOUSING IN THE GULVAL AREA</title>
		<content> There is a variety of housing and     
 living accommodation in the area. The 
 caravan site has some{residential}    
{caravans.}These are ingeniously       
 designed to give maximum facilities   
 and space, but lack of insulation is a
 drawback in hot or cold weather. There
 are{residential chalets}and{flats}at  
 Eastern Green. Though reasonable to   
 rent they are small for families.     
 Traditional granite{cottages}with     
 slate roofs are attractive and have   
 been modernised to include bathrooms. 
 Few have space for a garage, which can
 cause problems with car parking on    
 narrow village roads. Newer houses    
 tend to be{bungalows}or{detached}     
{houses}and usually have a garage and  
 garden. They are built of rendered    
 concrete blocks with tile or          
 artifical slate roofs. Many houses    
 have some kind of central heating.    </content>
