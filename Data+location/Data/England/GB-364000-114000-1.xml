		<content> Beautiful old residential Sherborne   
 nestles in the valley below the woods 
 and farmland to the south and east.   
 Its station is on the main Exeter to  
 London railway line which runs to the 
 west of the ruins of old Sherborne    
 Castle and of the "new" one built by  
 Sir Walter Raleigh. The busy road to  
 Dorchester forks one mile out of      
 Sherborne and this branch (A3030) goes
 through the small villages of North   
 Wootton and Alweston in which there is
 a small Post Office-cum-General Store.
 The road opposite this shop is narrow 
 and goes through the rest of Alweston 
 and then on to the small village of   
 Haydon where there is a rear entrance 
 to the private grounds of Sherborne   
 Castle and to Sherborne Lake below.   
 The overall picture is one of fields, 
 trees, small villages and a lovely old
 Abbey town.                           </content>
