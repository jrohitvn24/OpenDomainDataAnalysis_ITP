		<title>11FISHERMAN INTERVIEW(contd.)</title>
		<content> We fish up to forty miles             
 out,that is wreck fishing, it is a    
 natural habitat for fish like conger, 
 pollock,bream,ling,they all feed on   
 each other.We often fish on the       
 Skerries bank,which may only be 30 ft 
 in depth,but the average depth is     
 50-60 ft..Once we caught an 86lb      
 conger,but the biggest fish was I     
 suppose a cod of about 30lbs.I've     
 caught ling also,nothing exceptional  
 at 30lb.. Pollock,well I had the world
 record on pollock at one time on light
 line. I believe in educating the      
 anglers to fish as light as possible  
 and they're gradually coming over to  
 this way of fishing.I had a very good 
 pollock on record for two weeks.The   
 chap that knocked me off was a chap I 
 took on my boat. But I dont mind,it   
 was caught on my boat."
