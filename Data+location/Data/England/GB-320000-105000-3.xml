		<title>03Upottery's Farming Methods</title>
		<content> In the olden days farmers used Shire  
 horses and scythes.They had steam     
 tractors and they had knives          
 to cut the crops. They had carts too. 
 And it was a long day for them.       
 In the olden days they used horses    
 to plough the fields and they had     
 carts instead of the trailers and     
 tractors of today.                    
 They used knives to cut the corn      
 and it took them about one whole day  
 to cut it.                            
  Today the farmer uses many different 
 machines to help him in his work.The  
 tractor has replaced the horse and    
 pulls the agricultural machinery for  
 preparing land ,sowing crops,tending  
 them and harvesting . One farmer still
 sows a small section by hand as it is 
 too steep for machinery.              
  Machines also help in other work too 
 like milking a dairy herd.            </content>
