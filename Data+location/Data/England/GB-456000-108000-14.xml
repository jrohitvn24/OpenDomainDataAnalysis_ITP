  There is a large population of       
 all the common British birds;sparrows,
 starlings, blackbirds,thrushes and    
 tits.The quiet rural nature of the    
 area ensures a large number of less   
 common birds. Magpies are frequently  
 seen in pairs in the hedgerows;       
 yellowhammers and wrens nest among the
 hawthorns and swallows and swifts feed
 along the rivers.The grassland and    
 cereals provide a hiding place for the
 nests of skylarks,as well as a ready  
 larder of fieldmice for the hunting   
 kestrels.                             
 A heron was observed fishing along the
 river Wallington but it's nest was not
 discovered.There is a large colony of 
 both rooks and crows in the copse.
