		<title>07St.Leonards Church.</title>
		<content> The present church is almost 900 years
 old and was built on the site of a    
 Saxon church. On the south wall is a  
 scratch dial. When you put your finger
 on the centre of the dial the shadow  
 points to what time it is. In the     
 church are some very rare hand painted
 organ pipes. Roman bricks are inlaid  
 in the unique stone altar screen.     
 The font is cracked. This damage was  
 done by Oliver Cromwell's soldiers. In
 the early 19 hundreds the roof        
 collapsed during a service. There is  
 now a new roof. The church is named   
 after St. Leonard who is the patron   
 saint of prisoners. Nowadays 50-60    
 people attend Sunday morning service. 
 At the side of the church there is a  
 children's altar and every Sunday     
 about 20 children attend Sunday       
 school. The church is now locked      
 because of vandalism and pilfering.   </content>
