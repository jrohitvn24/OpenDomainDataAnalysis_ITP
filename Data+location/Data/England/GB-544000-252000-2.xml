		<content>{   Trumpington}is mainly residential, 
 and consists mostly of a housing      
 estate which looks fairly badly built.
 There are a lot of{teenagers}hanging  
 around doing nothing, giving the      
 impression of a run down area.        
                                       
    In mid-afternoon we counted the    
 traffic on the A1310. In one          
 minute 17 cars pass through on the way
 to Cambridge and 9 cars going         
 South from Cambridge. On average one  
 lorry comes or goes every minute.     
                                       
   {Buses}stop at Trumpington fifteen  
 times a day (to and from Cambridge),  
 from Monday to Saturday. On Sunday    
 buses stop only 7 times. The bus stop 
 is used by 'CAMBUS' and 'NATIONAL     
 EXPRESS'.
