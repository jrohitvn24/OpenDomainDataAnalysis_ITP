		<title>03LIFE IN FREELAND</title>
		<content>                                       
Rachel has one brother and one sister  
who are younger than her. We asked her 
what she did in the evenings, she      
replied "I watch the television". She  
has one cat as her pet. At the weekends
Rachel goes out with her friends to    
play. She entertains herself by going  
to Guides, tennis, modern dancing and  
things like that. She thinks life in   
Freeland is good and really enjoys it. 
                                       
Rachel told us that she walks to school
or comes in the car. She never has     
school dinners so she doesn't know what
they are like. There are 33 children in
her class and more than 100 in the     
school. Her favourite subjects are     
maths and handwriting, and other       
favourite subjects are art, painting   
and study.
