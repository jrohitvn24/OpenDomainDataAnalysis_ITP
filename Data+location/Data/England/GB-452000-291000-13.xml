		<title>13MIXED FARMING</title>
		<content> In the farmer's barn were two piles of
{ wheat}and{barley}.We went to see his 
{ machines}.We saw a combine harvester,
 wind tunnel,an egg grader,spraying    
 machinery,grain auger,plough,tractor  
 and fertiliser spreader.              
  The farmer had 4,000{battery hens}   
 caged in five rows and four layers.   
 The hens made lots of noise and       
 flapped about.When the lights were    
 turned off they settled again.        
  We saw some{piglets}.The farmer      
 picked them up by the back legs.We    
 held one and its skin felt rough.The  
 piggery smelled when we first went in 
 but we soon got used to it.We thanked 
 the farmer for allowing us to visit   
 his farm.
