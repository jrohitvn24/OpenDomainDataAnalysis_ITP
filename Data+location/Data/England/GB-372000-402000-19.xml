		<content> THOUGHTS ON WORSLEY                   
{THE GOOD}_ The linear parkway is      
 pleasant for people to walk their dogs
 on, or if you just want a quiet stroll
 the linear parkway is just the place  
 for you because it's {very quiet}.We  
 are lucky to have the park with swings
 and roundabouts and tennis courts. I  
 like to go swimming in my spare time  
 at the swimming baths.                
{THE BAD}_ The litter in Worsley is all
 over the place. People just throw     
 crisp packets and toffee papers all   
 over the place.                       
{THE UGLY}_ Graffiti spoils the look of
 garages, walls and the bandstand.     
 People break windows and railings and 
 leave broken glass where children and 
 dogs may cut themselves.
