		<content> The owners of{FURLONGS FARM}own       
 160 acres of land and  grow           
 potatoes,barley and wheat.They have   
 worked on the farm for four years.The 
 animals that are kept on the farm     
 are chickens,geese,cows and hens.The  
 people on the farm have to get up at  
 six o_clock and they have to feed all 
 the animals before starting their own 
 eggs.For the hens was a big pen and   
 when they are old enough to lay eggs  
 they go into a special place .        
 For the cows there is a very big      
 sheltered hut.It is very muddy and it 
 has to be cleaned out twice a week.The
 geese also have a little hut.It is    
 covered in straw and in the middle is 
 a big nest.It takes about one month   
 for the baby geese to hatch out.
