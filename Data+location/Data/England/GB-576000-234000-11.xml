		<content>   There is a doctor's surgery in St.  
 James Street run by two doctors in    
 partnership. Approx. 30 people visit  
 the surgery each day , and 15         
 prescriptions are dispensed. The      
 doctors make house calls each day and 
 about Â£10,000 worth of drugs is kept  
 at the surgery.                       
   A baby and infant clinic is held    
 twice monthly in Sible Hedingham      
 Village Hall which is well attended.  
   Aids for disabled people and for    
 home nursing are available in the     
 village.                              
   A chiropodist occasionally visits   
 the pensioner's club which is held on 
 Friday afternoons.                    
   Hospital visits present some        
 difficulties because of the distances 
 involved (at least 5 miles to Halstead
 or 20 miles to Colchester), especially
 in emergencies or accidents.          </content>
