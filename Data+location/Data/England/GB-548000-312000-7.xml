 protect them from aphids and greenfly.
 The weather also, particularly too    
 much rain and wind and severe frost,  
 can damage the roses. Mr. Sutton      
 sells roses all over England and      
 Scotland. He uses lorries to transport
 them. He does not use rail transport  
 because it is too slow. He owns two of
 his own lorries and  uses local       
 transport companies as well.          
     The soil gets fed up of growing   
 roses all the time and the plants are 
 more prone to disease if they are     
 grown in the same soil. Therefore he  
 grows conifer trees in particular     
 Golden Leylandi. This rests the soil  
 from the rose plants.                 
      The best time of year for        
 business is in September.
