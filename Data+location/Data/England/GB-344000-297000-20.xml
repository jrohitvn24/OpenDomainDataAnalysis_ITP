		<content>  People who live here follow the      
 traditional pattern of life associated
 with the English countryside.         
  The population is predominantly      
 middle-aged to elderly,including many 
 who are widowed.As in many areas,young
 people of all abilities find          
 difficulty in obtaining employment.   
  A number of newcomers have been      
 attracted to the area and have been   
 made welcome,although for some people 
 the transition from town to country   
 life can be a lengthy process.        
  Both socially and practically,local  
 people co-operate to produce a happy  
 community atmosphere,and both         
 residents and visitors alike are fully
 appreciative of the natural beauty of 
 the area.
