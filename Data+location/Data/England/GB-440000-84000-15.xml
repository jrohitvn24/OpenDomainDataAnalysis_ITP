		<content> I am a{twelve year old girl.}I get up 
 at 7.30 and have cereal and milk for  
 my breakfast.                         
   The school bus collects me          
 from the cross roads at 8am.  I go to 
 school in Freshwater eight miles away.
 I have a cooked lunch at Noon. We have
 four lessons in the morning and three 
 in the afternoon.  The school bus     
 drops me home at 4.15pm. My Mother    
 only works part time so she is able to
 give me Beans and egg between 5 and   
 6pm. Sometimes I ride my bicycle in   
 the evening otherwise I watch         
 television until bedtime between      
 9 and 10pm.                           
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
