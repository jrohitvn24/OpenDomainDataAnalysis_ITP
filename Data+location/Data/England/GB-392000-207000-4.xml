		<title>04Miserden Estate Farming 2</title>
		<content>   Since there is no way of expanding  
 the Estate the Farming must become    
 increasingly intensive;to put more    
 cattle on to less grazing land and    
 grow more crops on free land that has 
 been released from livestock.         
   There is a broad rotation scheme,   
 three years of cereal,two of oil seed 
 rape and then back to cereal again.   
   The Estate has{three large          
{tractors,two combine harvesters and a 
{round baler.50 acres can be ploughed  
{in a day and 140 acres can be drilled 
{in a day.}This kind of equipment has  
 reduced the labour force quite        
 dramatically.                         
   A wide variety of{chemical sprays   
 are used for weed control,fungi and   
 various cereal diseases. Sophisticated
 sprays are vital for modern farming.
