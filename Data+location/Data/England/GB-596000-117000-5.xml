		<content> With a long coastline, few trees or   
 hedges, and dyke-edged sheep pasture  
 and arable, Camber's  breeding birds  
 are somewhat restricted, ranging from 
 redshank, ringed plover and           
 oystercatcher to wheatear, yellow     
 wagtail and corn bunting.  The once   
 famous Midrips has now only one       
 stretch of water but still mamanges to
 attract a few scarce waders on        
 migration, while other migrants       
 passing through the area include      
 firecrest, black redstart and the     
 occasional hoopoe or golden oriole.   
 In winter hen harriers and short-eared
 owls range over the fields. Camber is 
 a happy hunting ground for            
 lepidopterists, with sand dart, nutmeg
 and lyme grass among the rarities.    
 For botanists the littoral has a good 
 range of coastal plants, such as      
 seakale, sea holly and sea pea.       </content>
