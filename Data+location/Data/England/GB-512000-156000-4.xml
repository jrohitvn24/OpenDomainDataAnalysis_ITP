		<title>04M25 Wisley To Leatherhead</title>
		<content>    The idea of building the motorway  
 was really first{thought of by the    
{government in 1930,}but construction  
 did  not start until November 1982 on 
 this particular section.{The M25 is   
{being built as a detour for people    
{travelling across London because      
{London is so busy.                    
    The M25 is made of two different   
 materials. First hard gravel is put   
 down. This is covered by layers of    
 thin and thick concrete. Some parts   
 are then covered with tarmac. 140,000 
 tons of concrete was used to build    
 this section. The workmen saved a lot 
 of money by digging gravel from a wood
 nearby and replacing it with hardcore.
 The Leatherhead interchange opened 10 
 months early, in August 1984.{This    
{section will be open by September     
{1985.
