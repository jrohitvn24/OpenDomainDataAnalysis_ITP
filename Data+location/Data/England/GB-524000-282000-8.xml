		<title>08UPWOOD CHURCH (PART 2)</title>
		<content> Parts of the church have been there   
 since eleven hundred.The church wasn't
 there till after the Domesday book was
 made but there was one where the new  
 one is.Nearly all the people who died 
 in Upwood House have stones marking   
 their names near the Altar.There is   
 supposed to be a passage from Upwood  
 House to the Church or to a possible  
 monastery.The last person to be buried
 was in 1981 but no_one is allowed to  
 be buried there now.There is a place  
 where people who got the plague were  
 buried.The money from services goes   
 towards repairing the Church.The vicar
 is called Mr.Schofield.One day one of 
 the services was interrupted by a bat 
 in distress.
