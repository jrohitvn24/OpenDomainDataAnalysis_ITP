     Our grid measuring 4x3 km. lies on
 the eastern boundary of the city of   
 Leicester and stretches from the      
 villages of Scraptoft and Thurnby in  
 the west to Houghton on the Hill in   
 the east.                             
     The area to be surveyed is the    
 valley of the Thurnby brook which lies
 between two ridges to the north and   
 south of the stream. The brook rises  
 near New Ingarsby and flows to the    
 city centre where it joins the River  
 Soar.                                 
      The villages Scraptoft, Thurnby  
 and Houghton on the Hill lie in the   
 NW,SW, and SE corners of the grid and 
 the abandoned  village of Ingarsby    
 lies just outside NE corner. Scraptoft
 and Ingarsby villages are mentioned   
 in the original Domesday Book, a copy 
 of which can be found in the church.  </content>
