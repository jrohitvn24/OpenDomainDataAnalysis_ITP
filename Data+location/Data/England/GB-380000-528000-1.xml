		<content> Widdy Bank Fell is part of the        
 northern Pennines rising to 1716ft    
 (532m).  Its surface is rounded by    
 vblanket peat and includes grass areas
 on the outcrops of Sugar Limestone.   
 The western flank - the former Wheal -
 is inundated by Cow Green Reservoir. a
 retention dam blocking the flow of the
 river Tees on the Whinsill outcrop at 
 the head of Cauldron Snout.  At the   
 footof this cascade the main stream is
 joined by Maize Beck, and then flows  
 eastwards, then northwards throygh a  
 deep glaciated trench passed Falcon   
 Clints and then Crankley Scar-natural 
 cliffs on the Whinsill - to Widdy Bank
 farm which controls the sheep grazing 
 on the fell. Visitors are catered for 
 by a Car Park, Toilets and fishing    
 lodge at Cow Green.
