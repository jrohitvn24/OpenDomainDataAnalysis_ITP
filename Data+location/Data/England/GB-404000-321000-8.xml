		<content> The area is mostly intensively managed
 grassland with some rough grazing.    
 Cereal crops are grown mostly on the  
 east side of the Admaston-Rugeley     
 road.  the area supports beef and     
 dairy herds of cows mainly of the     
 Fresian breed.  Sheep gaze the verges 
 of the reservoir.  The hedges to th   
 fields are well maintained and are    
 mainly of hawthorn, field maple and   
 elm with a small amount of lackthorn, 
 damson, elder and a few crab apples.  
 Trees grown in the hedes are mostly   
 oak, this being the dominant tree, ash
 and a few willow and sycamore.  In the
 rough razing dandelions, buttercups,  
 clover, dock and thistles appear in   
 their due season.  The river Blythe   
 flows out of the reservoir and along  
 this valley alders and willows grow.
