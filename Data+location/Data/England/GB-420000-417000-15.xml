		<title>15INDUSTRY IN THE AREA (part1)</title>
		<content> The original industry in the area was 
 farming.With the Industrial Revolution
 cottage industries such as spinning   
 and weaving were developing into the  
 main industry of the area.Weaving and 
 spinning mills were built close to the
 R.Calder.Local drift and deep mines   
 were developed and supplied the fuel. 
 The transport system in the valley was
 improved by the construction of road, 
 rail and canal links to nearby towns. 
 This transport network was used to    
 bring in the raw materials and to take
 out the finished products.An allied   
 engineering industry also developed   
 making and repairing textile machines.
 Half a dozen mills were built in our  
 block of land and employed many people
 in spinning and weaving wool.One      
 spinning mill produced cotton thread. 
 Only three mills are still engaged in 
 textile production                    </content>
