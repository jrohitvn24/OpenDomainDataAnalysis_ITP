		<title>10RELIGION IN N.TONBRIDGE</title>
		<content>  We interviewed 100 people,in various 
 residential areas,on their religious  
 beliefs.25 refused to answer,of whom  
 21 looked over 40;53 of those who ag- 
 reed believed in God.11 did not bel-  
 ieve,and another 11 couldn't decide.8 
 of the undecided looked over 20 and   
 under 40.10 of the non-believers      
 looked under 40.Most believers were   
 Church of England,with 4 Catholics,4  
 with no preference,3 Baptists,2 Meth- 
 odists and 1 Congregational.Many go to
 St. John's Hildenborough for Sunday   
 church,but more go to a parish church 
 outside the area.3 elderly people go  
 to Cage Green church,3 to a Baptist   
 church,and 2 to St.Saviour's Ton-     
 bridge.Of the 38 people who go to     
 church,12 go every week,and 21 only go
 about 3 times a year.5 people go      
 between 1 and 3 times a month.
