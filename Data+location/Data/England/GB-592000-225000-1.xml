		<title>01LOCAL HISTORY,WEST BERGHOLT</title>
		<content>  WEST BERGHOLT LITERALLY MEANS 'WOOD  
 ON A HILL.'THE WEST IS THERE BECAUSE  
 OF EAST BERGHOLT IN SUFFOLK.THE PARISH
 BOUNDARY IS APPROX.11 MILES IN        
 CIRCUMFERENCE,WITH A TOTAL ACREAGE OF 
 2000 ACRES.IT IS MAINLY AN            
 AGRICULTURAL VILLAGE,WITH QUITE A FEW 
 FARMS.THE ESTATES HAVE CHANGED HANDS  
 MANY TIMES,BELONGING TO AT LEAST ONE  
 NOBLE FAMILY,THE SACKVILLES(THE       
 VILLAGE HAS BEEN CALLED BARKHOLT-     
 SACKVILLE AFTER THEM),THE DISTERS,THE 
 GRIMSTONS,THE DENHAMS etc.COOK'S HALL 
 WAS ONCE CALLED NETHER HALL,BECAUSE IT
 WAS ON LOWER GROUNDS THAN BERGHOLT    
 HALL.IT IS NOW CALLED COOK'S HALL     
 BECAUSE IT FELL INTO THE POSSESSION OF
 AN ADAM COOK.IN THE VILLAGE THERE USED
 TO BE A LOT OF HEATHLAND BUT IT HAS   
 RAPIDLY DIMINISHED DURING THE LAST    
 CENTURY OR SO,MOST BEING TAKEN FOR    
 HOUSING.                              </content>
