		<title>07Life in a sub post-office.</title>
		<content>My name is Claire Hewitt and my parents
own a local sub post-office.Certain    
days are particularly busy.Thursday is 
one of those days.Thursday is pension  
day.Many people come to the post-office
early so that they avoid queuing.As    
well as coming to collect their        
pensions and buy stamps and postal     
orders, people buy things from the     
hardware section.                      
Friday is another busy day,because it  
is accounts day.We have to add up all  
the money,check the stamps and make    
sure that everything is all right.     
Saturday is not so busy.Most people    
come into the shop to buy something    
from the hardware section.             
On Sunday the shop is closed.          
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
