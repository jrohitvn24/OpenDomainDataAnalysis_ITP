		<title>12Memories of Gotherington</title>
		<content> The Evergreens are a group of O.A.P's.
 who get together in Gotherington      
 Village Hall once a fortnight.This is 
 what one of them recalls about the    
 village in recent times.              
 'Gotherington in the early 20th       
 century had a population of 350.It was
 a poor straggly village but had a good
 name for paying its way.All adults    
 took out insurance policies to pay for
 funeral expenses.The railway which ran
 through the village wasn't used by the
 villagers because the station was too 
 far away. There was a Carrier who came
 by cart from Gretton Fields who would 
 deliver things to Cheltenham.A bus    
 service started at the end of the 2nd 
 World War.At the time of the          
 Coronation of the present Queen there 
 was a grand Fete.There was lots to eat
 which was a treat as we were still    
 getting over rationing.'              </content>
