		<title>10GARFORTH LIBRARY</title>
		<content>{Garforth Library}has{26,OOO books.}It 
 is on the corner of{MAIN STREET}and{  
{CHURCH LANE.}There are 5 full time and
 l half time staff. Garforth Library   
 was opened on the l9th February l969  
 by LADY CLEGG J.P. Chairman of the    
 County Liberal Committee because      
 previously there was no library in    
 Garforth. Each member has two tickets 
 but you can request more. For each    
 ticket you can have one book. When you
 have chosen your books the attendant  
 stamps a small piece of paper in each 
 cover. The date stamped is the date   
 you must bring your book back by. If  
 you do not return your book by this   
 date you get a fine. After the        
 attendant has stamped your book she   
 takes an indexing card containing the 
 book's name and slots it in your      
 ticket. The library is divided into   
 adults and childrens sections.        </content>
