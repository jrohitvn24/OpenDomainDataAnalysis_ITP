		<content>During the month of June 1985 there    
were the usual monthly meetings of the 
Lavenham Parish Council and the Women's
Institute.The local Salvation Army held
their Annual Summer Fete in the garden 
of the Manor House.June 14th-18th saw  
the visit of the descendants of the    
SPRYNG family.They came from all parts 
of the world,but chiefly from          
Australia.The famous SPRYNG family     
were wealthy weavers and clothiers in  
Lavenham in the 15th century and were  
very much involved with the building of
Lavenham Church. Work on the present   
building started in 1485.Local Church  
members took the visitors round the    
village and provided lunches and       
teas.At the close of the visit there   
was an Eucharist of Thanksgiving in the
Parish Church with an attendance of    
approximately 250.
