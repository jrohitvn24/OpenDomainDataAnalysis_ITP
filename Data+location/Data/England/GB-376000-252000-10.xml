      The school began in 1861 as Leigh
 Hurst (meaning 'a wooded hillock') and
 it continued under that name when the 
 National school gave way to a Board   
 school in 1932, housed in its new     
 'temporary' wooden building.  At this 
 time the secondary age children began 
 to go to schools in Malvern - first   
 Senior, then 'Modern' and now High    
 schools.                              
                                       
      There have been additions to the 
 original wooden schoolroom in the     
 shape of a double 'demountable' unit, 
 'Portaloos' for sanitary purposes,    
 plus sheds to house various kinds of  
 equipment.  Its finest features are   
 its site and its playing field.  It   
 became Bransford Primary School in the
 1970's and now has some 50 children.  </content>
