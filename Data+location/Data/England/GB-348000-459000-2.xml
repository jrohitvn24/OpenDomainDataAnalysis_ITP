		<title>02The Ashton Memorial      (C)</title>
		<content> The limestone memorial with a copper  
 dome was built in 1908 by Lord Ashton 
formerly James Williamson,owner of a   
factory which made linoleum that was   
invented by his father.He was for a    
time MP for Lancaster.It was built in  
memory of his wife at a cost of 87000  
pounds.It is situated in Williamson    
Park so it dominates the sky-line of   
Lancaster.Over the years it fell into  
disrepair and in 1984 the City Council 
voted to put 100000 pounds towards the 
fund for restoring the memorial.  In   
October 1981 it was estimated it would 
cost 368742 pounds to turn the ground  
floor into a craft centre and the first
floor into an exhibition centre.The    
present plan is to use the building as 
the focal point of a Theme Park.From   
special platforms people will be able  
to look out on the town and park.
