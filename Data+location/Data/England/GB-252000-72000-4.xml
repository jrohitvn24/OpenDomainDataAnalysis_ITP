		<content> Whilst there are a few fields used for
 grazing a large proportion is rough   
 moorland used by "Commoners' Rights"  
 mainly for sheep but with a few cattle
 and ponies. Many of the dry stone     
 walls have been allowed to fall into  
 disrepair and grazing land has        
 reverted to rough land encroached by  
 bracken. Most former farmsteads have  
 become small-holdings, the majority of
 the associated land sold to farmers   
 whose farms are up to 10 miles        
 distant. Sheep grazing has an adverse 
 effect on the natural moorland due to 
 the close cropping of grasses. The    
 black-faced and Cheviot are hardy     
 breeds, as are the Galloway black     
 cattle, being able to surive severe   
 weather except for very deep snow.
