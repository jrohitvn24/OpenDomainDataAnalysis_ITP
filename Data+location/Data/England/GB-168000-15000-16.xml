		<title>16Girls in the football team</title>
		<content> This year Grade Ruan primary school   
 was in the newspapers and on          
 television in the programme "That's   
 Life". It all started with a football 
 match.We played football against      
 another team and won 3-2. But after   
 the game we were told we would have to
 play it again because we had a girl   
 playing and it was against the rules. 
 So, as we only have ten boys we had to
 play ten against eleven. We still beat
 them and got into the final. We still 
 had to play ten against eleven and    
 lost 3-2. So the BBC invited us to the
 television studios in London.At the   
 "That's Life" studio we had to change 
 into our football strip.We had to sing
 a song about twenty times.Eventually  
 we got it right.Then we went to a     
 hotel.It was good fun but we still    
 cannot have a girl in our football    
 team.                                 </content>
