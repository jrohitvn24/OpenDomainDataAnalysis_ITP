		<content> St. Mary Magdalen Church is a Grade 1 
 Listed Building. The original         
 structure dates from 13th Century and 
 the foundations and the tower remain  
 Medieaval. The north porch is early   
 17th Century and is said to have come 
 from Woodford House, Northamptonshire.
 The church was substantially          
 remodelled in 18th Century, being     
 commissioned by Samuel Whitbread,     
 father in law to 12th Lord St. John of
 Bletsoe. It is now one of the largest 
 churches in North Bedfordshire.       
 The pews are all box pews dating from 
 1779. The St. John family pew in the  
 chancel contains a fireplace, which   
 was still in use in 1960's.           
 Sadly, the church is great need of    
 repair, suffering from dry rot, wet   
 rot and death watch beetle. This work 
 is now being undertaken.
