		<title>01The Area of our study.</title>
		<content>Today it was bright and sunny we walked
to the top of the hill behind St.Mary's
Church ,Ashbury to see the view of the 
study area.We found two fossils in a   
corn field in the chalk rock.When we   
looked across at the slopes of the     
coombs,they looked rough and bumpy but 
when you look down the hill all the    
fields of the vale are flat and then it
goes up hill again. The farmers donot  
grow crops on the steep combs slopes   
because a tractor would roll over.     
The coombs are made of chalk they are  
valleys formed by water a long         
time ago, there is no water there      
now.If left for sheep to feed off it   
can grow many kinds of wild flowers    
and butterflies such as the common     
blue,and chalk hill blue,and brown     
argus.Some grasses are called up right 
broome,blue moor grass.
