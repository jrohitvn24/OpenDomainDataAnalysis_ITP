   My name is Zabina Khan. I am 10     
 years old. I am going to tell you the 
 history of my family.                 
   It all started when my father came  
 to England from Pakistan on 22nd      
 April 1962. My father thought he would
 stay in Worcester with his cousins and
 friends.He worked in Metal Casting and
 Metal Box. Then in 1967 my father     
 returned to Pakistan then in 1974 he  
 came back to England with my mother   
 and my elder brother.We bought a house
 of our own.My father then got  his old
 job back.I was born in 1974.          
   A man who worked with my father     
 taught him English. When we had enough
 money we bought a small grocery shop. 
   Now I have two brothers and one     
 sister. My family is happy in England 
 but we shall be going to Pakistan from
 time to time to see our relations.    </content>
