		<content> The{deputy speaker}is{elected}by the  
{Members of Parliament.}Mr.Walker was  
 asked by the{leader of the House}and  
 the{chief whip}if he would take on the
 job.He accepted and the House voted to
 appoint him. Since his election in    
{June 1983}Mr.Walker has been present  
 every working day in the House.He has 
 a{daily conference}with{the speaker.} 
 Many years ago  when there was only   
 one speaker he was not allowed to     
 leave the chair so if he needed the   
 toilet they drew a canopy round the   
 chair and gave him a chamber pot!If   
 the Members of Parliament get{rowdy}it
 is the speakers job to keep them in   
 order.He shouts{order,order,}speaks   
 personally to the Members of          
 Parliament and if all else fails he   
 suspends the House till tempers cool.
