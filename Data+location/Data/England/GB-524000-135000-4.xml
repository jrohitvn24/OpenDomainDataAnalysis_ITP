		<title>04PUBLIC OPEN SPACE IN CRAWLEY</title>
		<content> Ours is above all a green town with   
 open space in reach of everyone. Close
 by are Tilgate and Buchan Parks set in
 high ground, lakes and forest. Town   
 centre{Memorial Gardens}are a formal  
 oasis: a good place to rest in summer 
 lunchtimes.{The Hawth}joins{Southgate 
{Park}and is a wild woodland habitat in
 the town. Next to it are acres of     
 playing fields.{Broadfield Playing    
{Field}is part of a linear open space  
 along the A23. It is well landscaped  
 and planted around pitches, and       
 divided by a path.{West Green Playing 
{Field}is home to the Rugby and        
 Association football clubs. There are 
 more playing fields at{Ifield,}where  
 there is a "village" cricket club on  
 the{Green,}and an 18-hole golf course.
 Goff's Park and the Leisure Centres   
 are written of elsewhere. Crawley is  
 second to none in sport for its size. </content>
