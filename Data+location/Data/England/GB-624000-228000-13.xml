		<content>  There are plenty of clubs and        
 societies in Dovercourt for children  
 to join.                              
 For the girls (and a few boys) there  
 are dancing classes. These include    
 classes in ballet,tap,ballroom and    
 modern dancing. Children can take     
 examinations and also take part in an 
 annual show where certificates and    
 prizes are presented.                 
 Many boys enjoy martial arts courses  
 and eagerly participate in judo and   
 karate classes.                       
 There is a good athletics club which  
 encourages children's skill and       
 interest in sport. Since the opening  
 of the new indoor swimming pool many  
 children have joined the swimming club
 to improve their swimming skills and  
 take part in swimming galas.There are 
 also Brownie Packs and Cub Scout packs
