		<title>02REDWAY CYCLE SYSTEM</title>
		<content> Milton Keynes is almost unique with   
 the Redways,the Redways are Milton    
 Keynes cycle system. You can get all  
 most any where you want using the     
 redways. Before you start going places
 on the redways you need a map. There  
 are a lot of sport fields and most of 
 them have redways running through     
 them. Most schools have a redway by   
 them so you can cycle to school. One  
 of the best things about redways is   
 they have bridges or an underpass     
 across the main roads. One of the     
 worse things is there are a lot of    
 hills to climb,some of the steeper    
 hills you have to walk your bike up.  
 I like the redways because where I    
 use to live i had to cycle on the     
 roads,which was not very nice because 
 of the danger of an accident which    
 made it difficult to go on a relaxing 
 ride.                                 </content>
