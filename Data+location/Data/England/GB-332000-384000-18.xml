 Rock Ferry By-pass.  These parallel   
 routes have each in their turn come   
 closer to the River Mersey.  The      
 Chester to Birkenhead Woodside        
 railway line passed through Rock Ferry
 before its closure .  The line        
 terminates at Rock Ferry where        
 passengers alight and board the       
{underground  trains}for Liverpool.

 buses are green and cream in colour   
 and have replaced the blue Birkenhead
