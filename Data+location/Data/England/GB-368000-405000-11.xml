		<content>{St.Vincent's R.C.Church}on New Brook  
 Rd. was opened in l969 in a dual      
 purpose building which is used as     
 church and parish hall. This is now   
 too small to serve the 700 catholics  
 of this parish so a new church is     
 being built at a cost of Â£200,000. It 
 will open for worship in December 1985
 Approx. 400 people representing every 
 age group attend 10a.m.mass on Sundays
                                       
{St.Andrew's Church}was opened in l977 
 replacing the earlier building of 1887
 Family Service at 10a.m. every Sunday 
 is the most popular service. It is a  
 thriving church and has its own       
 primary school, many of the pupils    
 attending the church and Sunday School
 as well as Brownies, Guides, Cubs and 
 Scouts. The school is a one-form entry
 but falling rolls have reduced numbers
 to almost half its capacity.          </content>
