		<content> The area of survey lies in the central
 part of southern Wirral,a peninsula   
 sandwiched between the River Dee and  
 the River Mersey.It is currently part 
 of the county of Merseyside.          
    The 12 sq.Km.block for the most    
 part covers agricultural land,although
 there is a strip of residential       
 property along the western edge.Much  
 of the land is taken up by            
 Clatterbridge Hospital and by the     
 private residence of Lord Leverhulme. 
    Barnston Primary School is situated
 in the S.W.corner of the Block in an  
 area known as Heswall Hills,and it was
 from this school that the survey was  
 conducted.                            
    The survey concerns itself mainly  
 with the children in the Junior       
 Department of the school and as such  
 reflects their activities and the     
 activities of their families.         </content>
