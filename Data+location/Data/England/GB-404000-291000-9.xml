		<title>09MY CHURCH-Joanne and David</title>
		<content>At St.Matthew's church there is a      
choir. The priest stands at the front  
with the vicar and the other           
priest.Usually I go to church with the 
Brownies and we stand at the back and  
when church starts there's one that    
carries the flag and one Brownie       
on each side.While the choir is        
singing the songs we walk down the     
centre.                Joanne Larvin

My church is very  big. At the         
beginning of every month we have a     
communion service.And every August     
31st we have baptism. I am 10 years old
and I do think there is such thing as  
Christ. The congregation is very big   
and I do think everyone should go      
there.I have got lots of friends and   
one of them got baptised. His name was 
Alan. I will get baptised next year.   </content>
