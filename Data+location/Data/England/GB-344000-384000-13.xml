		<title>13Halewood - a typical Sunday.</title>
		<content>   A class of 35 eight year olds       
 carried out a survey and wrote about  
 "A Typical Sunday" in their lives to  
 see how children in Halewood use their
 spare time at the weekend.            
   Most time is spent playing outdoors 
 or watching television. Family        
 activities on Sunday included visits  
 to the swimming baths at Bridgefield  
 Forum (quite a few children), trips   
 out in the car to the seaside or the  
 countryside (a very few children).    
   Although this survey was carried out
 by the Church of England School only a
 tiny minority of the class attend     
 church regularly. "Parade Sunday"     
 attracts more church attendance but   
 very few attend on a regular basis.   
   The majority leisure activities seem
 to be watching T.V. and playing out.  
 There are few recreational facilities 
 for children in the local area.       </content>
