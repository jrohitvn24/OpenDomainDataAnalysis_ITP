		<title>17LIFE FOR A CHILD IN SHAW 1</title>
		<content> My name is Carol Potts.I am 9 years   
 old and I live in a house with my     
 brother,mum,dad and pet snake.This is 
 what happens on a typical weekday.    
                                       
 At 7.00am I wake up and my mum comes  
 in.She says good morning and asks me  
 what I want for breakfast.I usually   
 say buttered toast.Then I go into the 
 bathroom and have a wash.When I come  
 out I get dressed and go downstairs.  
 After breakfast I pack my schoolbag,  
 clean my teeth and brush my hair.Then 
 I watch television for 10 minutes.As  
 soon as I have seen my mum,brother and
 dad off to work or school,I go up the 
 road to my friend Kay's house and walk
 to school with her.                   
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
