		<title>14 THE BRANSHOLME MAISONETTES</title>
		<content>      The maisonettes are situated in  
 the centre of the Bransholme estate in
 Hull. They are grouped in eighteen    
 blocks which are built from pre-cast  
 pebble-dashed concrete slabs.         
    The blocks are six stories high and
 are connected by walkaways above      
 ground level. Each maisonette has a   
 balcony which residents use for       
 hanging out their washing, sunbathing,
 and keeping plants on. There are lifts
 and stairs for people to reach their  
 homes, and rows of garages for each   
 block. There are areas of grass and   
 bushes, and some play areas.          
    The maisonettes were built in the  
 early 1970's but they have become very
 unpopular because they let water in   
 and the design is poor. One block has 
 been dismantled for research into the 
 reasons for the dampness.
