		<content> Carlton Curlieu Hall also known as the
 Manor House is one of the finest      
 examples of 17th century architecture 
 of its kind in the county.  The house 
 was originally built by the Bale      
 family but has been owned by the      
 Palmer family since 1661.  The New    
 Hall was built in the mid 60's by Sir 
 Geoffrey Palmer.                      
 Manor Farm is a large 19th century    
 farm house of red brick with          
 extensive farm buildings.  There are  
 two cottages for farm workers.        
 Hall Cottages are two 19th century    
 farm cottages now made into one house 
 and occupied by the Hall gardener.    
 Home Farm is a large red brick        
 Victorian house, no longer a farm     
 house but privately owned by commuters
 to Leicester. Church Cottage is the   
 oldest cottage in the village with    
 stone foundations.                    </content>
