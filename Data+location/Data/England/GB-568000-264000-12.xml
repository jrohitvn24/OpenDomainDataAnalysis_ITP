		<content>Spillers Pet and Nutrition Unit started
in 1968 in Kentford but recently was   
taken over by Dalgety P.L.C.. They have
about 250 cats,125 dogs and 100 caged  
birds to test pet foods and            
accessories. There is an animal clinic 
and each animal has it's own medical   
file. To record the test results they  
use computers and videos. They have 20 
employees. The animals in there are    
better kept than most pets in the home.
Each dog has it's own kennel with a    
run. They also have possibly the best  
cattery in Europe. In the cat's room   
the air is kept at the same temperature
and every 10 minutes it is changed.    
The cat's room has a place where they  
can go outside. They give the animals 2
portions of different pet food and see 
which food it prefers.
