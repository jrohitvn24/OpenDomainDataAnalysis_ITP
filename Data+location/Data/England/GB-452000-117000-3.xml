		<content>            St.Peters Church           
                                       
 The original church was burnt down in 
 the year 1001 and soon another was    
 built in its place.                   
   The first rector was in the year    
 1086,the year of the{Domesday Survey  
 by William the Conqueror.             
   The massive oak door at the         
 entrance to the church has the date   
 1613 carved on it.                    
   The bell tower was built during the 
 reign of{Queen Elizabeth I}but it     
 collapsed on 31st of December 1582. It
 was rebuilt in 1584 and it was        
 finished in 1589.                     
   The church provides about Â£100 for  
 the{Sick &amp; Needy.}The weekly donations
 to the church by the congregation will
 be used for this or for other people  
 in need (e.g. Christian Aid).
