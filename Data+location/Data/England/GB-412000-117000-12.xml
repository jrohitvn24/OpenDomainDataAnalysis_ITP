		<title>12A Saxon church in Breamore 1</title>
		<content> Breamore church, now dedicated to St. 
 Mary, is an unusually complete example
 of late{Saxon architecture}of the 10th
 ,possibly 11th, century.The church is 
 a large building(39.7m long) without  
 aisles and of an embryonically        
 cruciform structure,the tower         
 occupying the centre of the cross,    
 the chancel and nave the central beam,
 and two lateral chapels the arms. The 
 North transept has vanished. The arch 
 to the South transept bears in Anglo  
 Saxon "But God hath in due time       
 manifested to us the word".The three  
 original corresponding arches probably
 completed the quotation but today only
 the letters DES survive.              
 A Saxon rood over the entrance to the 
 church within the North porch has been
 hideously mutilated.The figure of the 
 Lord on the Cross and the hanging     
 corpse of Judas can still be seen     </content>
