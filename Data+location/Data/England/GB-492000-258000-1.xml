		<content> Staploe parish in North Eastern       
 Bedfordshire is bounded North and East
 by Cambridgeshire. This gently        
 undulating area, just west of the main
 Ouse Valley, is drained by two small  
 tributary streams, Honeydon and Duloe 
 Brooks. The largest body of           
 surface water is the farm resevoir at 
 Lower Honeydon. Duloe Brook has a     
 series of small lakes, retained by    
 sluice and a scattering of farm ponds 
 remain unfilled, a notably large one  
 at Goodwick.                          
 Oxford clay rocks, here are thickly   
 covered by chalky boulder clay,       
 Glacial sands are exposed beside Duloe
 Brook at Bushmead and alluvium lines  
 the stream valley. Visually the       
 North-West and South-East of the      
 Parish are sharply contrasted. Around 
 Bushmead the "ancient" landscape and  
 Eastwards the large open fields.      </content>
