 Also in the Hall was a finger         
 stock. It was the property of Judge   
 Popham. There were holes in a  piece  
 of wood and a sort of top which came  
 over trapping your fingers. The only  
 way to get free was to break your     
 fingers. We all had a go in the       
 stocks, but I could get my finger out 
 easily because my hands were only     
 little, Some of the boys could not get
 their fingers out.                    
       The next room we went into was  
 the{Chinese}Room.We looked at the     
 walls and we noticed that on each side
 of the walls was a piece of Chinese   
 wall-paper.Each piece represented a   
 season Spring,Summer,Autumn,Winter.   
 There were also lots of Chinese       
 ornaments some were made of           
 Rubys.Every thing in the Chinese room </content>
