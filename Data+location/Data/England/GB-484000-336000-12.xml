		<content> Mrs Brooks is a Health Visitor living 
 in Barrowby. She works for a group of 
 doctors in Grantham. In her job she   
 visits all the children after they    
 are born until they are 4\ years old  
 to see that they are growing and      
 developing as they should. In her     
 spare time she plays badminton, golf  
 and swims and she has swum a mile to  
 raise money for Barrowby Church. In   
 the winter she sings in the Grantham  
 Choral Society. As she used to be a   
 nurse, she takes the Cubs for their   
 First Aid badge.
