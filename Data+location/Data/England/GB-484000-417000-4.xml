		<title>04Summer Weekends</title>
		<content> My favourite season of the year is    
 summer.Each week I look forward to the
 weekend because usually I go sailing  
 with my family.Sailing is our         
 favourite form of recreation.We have a
 seven metre sailing boat but in case  
 there isn't any wind we have an       
 engine. Our boat has four berths but  
 my dad made me a berth because we are 
 a family of five. We sail down the    
 River Trent to where the rivers Trent 
 and Ouse join to become the Humber and
 then on to Hull or Grimsby after      
 sailing under the Humber Bridge. I    
 help my dad to sail the boat. Even    
 when the water is rough I don't feel  
 frightened. I like sailing and our    
 boat. Even if we are not going sailing
 I go down to our boat with my fishing 
 rod.
