		<content> William Penn lived at Warminghurst, to
 the southeast, and regularly walked   
 across these fields to speak at Quaker
 meetings in the Friends Meeting House,
 the Blue Idol (1691), just north of   
 Old House Farm. It had two tiny burial
 grounds, which were unlawful.  Penn's 
 daughter is buried there.  Meetings   
 were also held at Saucelands, a stone 
 and mellow brick house near Coolham,  
 probably 15th C. Before Coolham school
 was built, the farmer who lived at    
 Saucelands let the Quakers teach local
 children in one room of the house.    
  Horelands at Broadford Bridge was the
 house of Isaac Bongard, who worked for
 glassmakers Carre of Wisborough Green 
 before glassmaking ended in 1618.     
   Smuggling was rife in the 18th C.  A
 smuggler's track ran from Gay Street  
 to Coneyhurst, and Old House Lane is  
 also known as Smuggler's Lane.        </content>
