		<title>08A Beef Farm near Combwich</title>
		<content>     Just off the road from Cannington 
 to Combwich,{Mr. Baker }has a farm.   
  He raises beef cattle.There are 3    
 types Red Devons,Herefords and        
 Simmentel.                            
 The farm is 133 acres in size and at  
 the moment there are 70 cattle.       
  There are no other animals on the    
 farm and no other farm workers.       
 The cattle are bought as young        
 bullocks,grazed and fed until         
 maturity and then sold at market      
 to be slaughtered for meat.Most of the
 land is used for grazing,but some     
 hay is made. Mr Baker has 3 tractors, 
 a bailer,a ditch digger and a building
 to house the cattle in winter. Mr.    
 Baker lives in a modern bungalow      
 but there is a very old farm house in 
 which machinery like a corn crusher   
 is kept.                              
                                       </content>
