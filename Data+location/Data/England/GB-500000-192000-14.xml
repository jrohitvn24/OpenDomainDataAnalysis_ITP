		<title>14The wildlife of our 'D'block</title>
		<content>  The wildlife in our area is mainly   
 birds{e.g.sparrows,thrushes,starlings 
{,blackbirds,crows,blue and great tits 
{,rooks,magpies,sea gulls,green,gold,  
{bull and chaffinches                  
  We do have some{rabbits,squirrels,   
{hedgehogs}and the occassional{fox.}   
  We also have a local{kestrel,}which  
 has its nest just outside our school. 
 The kestrel would hover way up in the 
 sky and suddenly dive down to the     
 ground,it might have spotted a small  
{rodent.}If the kestrel flys back up   
 into the air and starts hovering again
 ,it means it has missed its prey,but  
 if it stays down on the ground for a  
 few seconds and then flys off,it means
 it has caught its prey and eaten it or
 taken it back to feed its{chicks.     
  You would think that the M25 would   
 scare off all wildlife,but infact the 
 enbankments are filled with mice.     </content>
