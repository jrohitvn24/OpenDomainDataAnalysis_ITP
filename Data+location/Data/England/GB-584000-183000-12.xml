 Rod fishing can be difficult if the   
 tide is out, so you may have to hire a
 boat to go out into the estuary. The  
 fish you will catch are garfish,      
 mackerel, eels and mullet. You need to
 go out in the middle of the estuary to
 do net fishing.The bait used by rod   
 fishers is ragworm or lugworm. These  
 can be bought at one of the three     
 shops selling bait in this area.

 old and has been in Leigh for 10      
 years. It has 500 members.
