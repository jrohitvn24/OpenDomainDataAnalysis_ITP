		<title>15Wytham's Village Shop</title>
		<content> The Post-master and his wife, in the  
 village stores, meet all the people in
 Wytham. His sister-in-law keeps a     
 scrap book of local events. They gave 
 a first-hand picture of everyday life.
 No great changes have taken place in  
 the last four years. The bus comes    
 once a week; the post is delivered and
 collected once a day; newspapers are  
 brought from Wolvercote; the village  
 shop provides local needs; most people
 have cars and the local children      
 travel to Botley to school. The flats 
 in Wytham Abbey have fewer residents  
 now, but visitors to the village have 
 increased. Woodland animals forage in 
 the gardens, and the river floods the 
 fields in winter. The children love   
 the summer fete and the Christmas     
 carol-singing. The oldest inhabitant, 
 we were told, is aged 90, and the     
 youngest is aged 6 months.            </content>
