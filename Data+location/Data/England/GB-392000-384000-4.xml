		<content>    One of the oldest schools in this  
 area is{Norbury C.of E(Aided)Primary. 
  It was first built in 1835 and the   
 original building is still standing   
 and used each day.  The school        
 celebrated its 150th anniversary on   
 the 10th July,1985.  All the children 
 and staff dressed in period costume   
 for the day.  In the afternoon the    
 children were presented with          
 commemorative books and glasses.  A   
 special service was held to celebrate 
 the involvement of the Church in the  
 education system.   This was also a   
 sad time because the school will      
 shortly be moving to a new building on
 a new site.                           
   Most of the schools in the area are 
 now in new buildings in pleasant      
 surroundings with good playing fields 
 at each school.
