     Mrs Linda Amer has lived in       
Chinnor for 10 years. She was born in  
Sydenham a nearby village. She likes   
living in Chinnor because of the       
surrounding countryside and because    
there are plenty shops and             
restaurants. It is also near the M40   
so it is easy to go almost anywhere.   
She shops for food in Thame at Tesco   
and in High Wycombe for clothes,       
especially at Richards. In her spare   
time she enjoys gardening, keep fit    
and jazz dance. She also goes to an    
evening class for German conversation. 
She feels that Chinnor would be        
improved by having a swimming pool and 
sports complex. It also needs a shoe   
shop. Chinnor also needs a by-pass     
because a lot of heavy traffic passes  
through the village on the way to  the 
M40.The lorries make the windows rattle</content>
