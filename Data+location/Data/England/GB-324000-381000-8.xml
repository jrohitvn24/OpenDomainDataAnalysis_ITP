      Heswall, that used to be a hamlet
 with only a few shops, has grown      
 considerably and now in 1985 there are
 about 140 shops. In our survey we     
 found that the type of shops ranged   
 from off-licences to opticians,       
 florists to fancy goods and car       
 show-rooms to funeral-services, but by
 far the greatest number of shops were 
 those selling clothes and food because
 they are more essential. These amount 
 to 30% of the total number.           
     Some types of shop however        
 were not very common. For example     
 furniture shops and decorating        
 suppliers. These shops are usually    
 specialist in what they sell. There   
 were however five estate agents and   
 twelve building societies. This seems 
 to show that there is a good house    
 market in the area.                   </content>
