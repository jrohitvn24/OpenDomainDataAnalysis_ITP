		<title>01Exmouth: Our Town.</title>
		<content>   {Exmouth}is a town in{East Devon.}It
 has a population of about{33,000.}    
 There are 8 primary schools here.     
 There are 100 children from two       
 schools, Marpool Primary and          
 Brixington Junior, involved in the    
 Domesday Project. We are sharing a    
 4X3sq.km block.                       
    We think that life in Exmouth is a 
 lot of fun. In the summer when it is  
 hot we can go to the beach to         
 sun-bathe or swim in the pool. In the 
 evenings there are several clubs which
 we can go to, four of which are       
{Brownies, Cubs, Boys Brigade}and      
{Y.M.C.A.}                             
    During the summer Exmouth is a busy
 holiday resort. Although there are not
 many places to pitch a tent, there are
 quite a few hotels and a large caravan
 site called{Sandy Bay}4 km from our   
 schools.                              </content>
