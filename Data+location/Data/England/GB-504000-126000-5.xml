		<title>05WIS. GREEN CUB SCOUTS</title>
		<content> The cubs' and scouts' hutis situated  
 in Harsfold Lane off the A272 going   
 out of Wisborough Green towards       
 Billingshurst.The Akela runs the cubs 
 which starts at six o'clock and       
 finishes at seven-thirty.There are    
 about twenty cubs in the pack.        
     A favourite game is "Port and     
 Starboard" which is where all the cubs
 line up and Akela shouts some commands
 like "Port", "Starboard" or           
 "Lifeboats" and the cubs run to the   
 appropriate side of the room.         
     Their uniform is a green jumper, a
 green and white scarf and a green     
 peaked cap.                           
     The cubs have two camps like the  
 scouts.They are the Petworth Park camp
 and summer camp.
