		<title>01Kegworth, Sutton Bonington.</title>
		<content> The{River Soar,}a tributary of the    
 much larger{Trent}divides the area    
 roughly into two halves. The eastern  
 half centres on the village of{Sutton 
{Bonington}and the western half        
 includes the much larger village of   
{Kegworth. Sutton Bonington}is a very  
 long, thin village while{Kegworth     
 though larger is more compact. Between
 the villages lies the{School of       
{Agriculture}with some 300 students.   
{Kegworth}centres on its large 15th.   
 century church whilst{Sutton}contains 
 two smaller churches as it was        
 originally two villages. In the winter
 the{River Soar}floods the road between
 the two villages consequently flood   
 walks have been erected. In recent    
 years the development of the nearby   
{East Midlands Airport}has become a    
 local issue for the residents of both 
 villages.                             </content>
