		<content> We have a swimming pool 13 x 5 metres.
 Each class has a go in turn to go in  
 the pool in the warmer weather. Only  
 20 children are allowed in the pool at
 once so some have to sit out.         
 Up on the school field  we have two   
 pieces of playing apparatus -  a slide
 and a climbing frame, both made out of
 wood. The money for them came from    
 money we raised through holding a 70  
 mile walk, and a Sponsored Tables     
 Test. Every year we hold a School     
 Sports, A May Day Celebration, Carol  
 Service, Christmas Concert, Harvest   
 Festival, Open Evenings and an End of 
 Term Ceremony. After school activities
 include - netball, recorders, gymn    
 club, football, cycling proficiency,  
 computer club, softball, swimming and 
 cricket.                              
 We raise money for Action Aid and the 
 school helps a boy in India.          </content>
