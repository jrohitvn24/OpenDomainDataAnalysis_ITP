		<content>    Although the church is not in any  
 village it is quite well attended,    
 possibly because of a succession of   
 vicars who cared. The present vicar,  
 the Rev.Titterington was licensed in  
 July, 1985 for a period of two years. 
 The parishioners have chosen to       
 subsidize his stipend.It is the wish  
 of the Parish Church Council that     
 burial plots should be free to all    
 members of the parish. One service is 
 held each Sunday - at 10.30 a.m. The  
 organist, aged 86, has played for the 
 church for the past 40 years. Recently
 a non-denominational Women's Guild was
 formed and the Sunday School is to be 
 restarted. The monthly Parish Magazine
 is a valuable source of information   
 for the community, announcing births, 
 marriages and deaths, and bulletins of
 the sick, as well as ecclesiastical   
 news and forthcoming events.          </content>
