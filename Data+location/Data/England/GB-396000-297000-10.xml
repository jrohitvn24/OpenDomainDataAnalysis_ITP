		<content>  The Market Place, Stafford St. and   
 Cross Streer make up the main shopping
 area of Willenhall. The area has      
 recently bee pedestrianised with      
 exclusion of all traffic from these   
 streets except for access, designed to
 improve safety for Willenhall         
 shoppers. There are  about 120 retail 
 outlets most of which serve the       
 everyday needs of the local community,
 illustrated by the number of food     
 shops.                                
  A tradional market is held on        
 Wednesday, Friday and Saturday each   
 week. Surveys showed that people using
 the shops either lived or worked in   
 the imediate area, found the amenities
 adequate. A one way traffic system    
 operates in the streets immediatly    
 adjacent to the central shopping area 
 designed to ease the traffic flow,    
 since many of the streets are narrow. </content>
