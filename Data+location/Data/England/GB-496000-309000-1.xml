		<title>01Tickencote Village.</title>
		<content>    Tickencote village lies north of   
 Stamford and east of the A1. It is a  
 very attractive residential site,     
 whose claim to fame is the unique     
 Norman Chancel Arch.                  
     Originally the inhabitants were   
 estate workers. The Lords of te Manor 
 were the{Wingfields}- whoe were       
 distantly related to the{Cromwells.}  
 During the 1938-45 war the Hall was   
 used by H.M. Forces, and was pulled   
 down later. The present Hall was made 
 from outbuildings, etc.. Even the mill
 - by the{River Gwash}- has been made  
 into a private residence: likewise the
 school. The original inn - The Flower 
 Pot - is also a private dwelling.     
     There are{no}shops. The whole area
 is devoted to agriculture - mainly    
 mixed farming.
