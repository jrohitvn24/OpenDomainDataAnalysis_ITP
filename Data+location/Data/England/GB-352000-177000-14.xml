		<title>14LAWRENCE WESTON SCHOOL</title>
		<content> This is a{comprehensive school}for    
 boys and girls aged between{11 and 18 
{years.}Our Head Teacher is called Mrs.
 Whittington and there are three Deputy
 Heads. There are about{500 children}in
 the school. It is divided into seven  
 years. Most of our pupils come from   
 the immediate areas of Lawrence Weston
 and Sea Mills and either walk to      
 school or come by public bus services.
 Pupils take{examinations}such         
 as C.S.E. and G.C.E. "O" levels in the
 Fifth Year and G.C.E. "A" levels in   
 the Sixth Form. There is also a       
 special class for children who need   
 help with reading and writing. There  
 is a Library in the school. It is a   
{Public Library}as well as for the use 
 of the school. We have to get a note  
 to go to the Library at lunch times. I
 don't agree with this because after   
 all it is a Public Library. L.W.School</content>
