		<content>   There are two farms in this         
 area,Clifton Hall and Manor Farm,both 
 small farms.Clifton Hall Farm         
 concentrates on producing food for    
 cattle.                               
   Account by Jenny Townsend.          
   "We were taken round the farm.We    
 were told about the crops that were   
 growing.In Park Field we saw winter   
 barley;in Court Field we saw          
 grass.This was to be cut down for hay 
 but wet weather was making this       
 difficult.There was oil seed rape in  
 the lower meadow.When we walked round 
 the farm,we had a picnic in the empty 
 hay barn."                            
   Manor Farm uses its land for sheep  
 and cows.Poultry is also kept on this 
 farm.                                 
   The summer months of 1985 have been 
 very wet in Warwickshire,putting most 
 of the crops back by at least 3 weeks.</content>
