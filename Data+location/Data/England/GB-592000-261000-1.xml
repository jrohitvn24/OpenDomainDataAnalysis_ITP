		<title>01Four Mid-Suffolk Parishes</title>
		<content>  Most of the land in the parishes of  
 Beyton, Drink Stone, Hesset and       
 Tostock is given over to agriculture  
 (no longer a labour intensive         
 industry) - primarily cereals (wheat, 
 barley) and other crops (sugar beet,  
 field beans, oil-seed rape and        
 potatoes) but therre is also present a
 large herd of Charollais (Meade Farm, 
 Drink Stone) that claimed many firsts 
 at the 1985 Suffolk Agricultural Show.
 The parish churches are impressive,   
 attractive, always well and lovingly  
 tended both inside and out and        
 sometimes (infrequently) even well    
 attended.   Apart from the churches,  
 this area is dotted with large and    
 imposing (often beautiful) rectories, 
 manors, moated granges/farm housees   
 and halls.
