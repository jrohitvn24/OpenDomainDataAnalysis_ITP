		<title>07BUCKNALL SCHOOL - GENERAL</title>
		<content>{Bucknall County Primary School}was    
 built in 1854.  (It is now 131 years  
 old).  It has two classrooms, two sets
 of toilets, an office, and a kitchen  
 which was closed about 4 years ago,   
 and which we expect to be converted   
 into an art &amp; craft room this summer. 
 The staff is: Mr Kirk, Headteacher,   
 Mrs Bown, Infant Teacher, Mrs         
 Goulsbra, secretary, and Mrs Blakey,  
 dinner-time supervisor and caretaker. 
 There are 44 children.  19 of these   
 are Infants (4-7), and 25 are juniors 
 (7-11).  This is the largest roll for 
 at least 25 years.  Children from     
{Bucknall, Stixwould}and{Horsington    
 come to this school.  There is a large
 playground, but no field.  The school 
 sometimes uses the one year old       
 village hall for drama etc.  The      
 school building has been altered      
 greatly in the last seven years.      </content>
