		<title>16L'ton Harbour Today</title>
		<content> The Littlehampton Harbour today is an 
 area of increased development with a  
 large new industrial estate being     
 built on its banks.The traditional    
 industries of boat-building are still 
 present although these are now        
 confined to modern yachts made of     
 fibre glass.                          
 The harbour is visited by many large  
 vessels such as the Chichester City   
 and Star that bring in vast quantities
 of ballast used in the constuction of 
 roads etc.It is a thriving            
 industrial area employing many local  
 people.                               
 The new industries include Lifeboat   
 building,timber merchants,electronics 
 and small engineering industries.     
 There is an important tourist industry
 centered in and around the harbour    
 which includes a modern Marina and    
 large floating restaurant.            </content>
