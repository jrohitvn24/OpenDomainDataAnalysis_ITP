		<content>{  Housing}on the eastern outskirts of 
 Hull is both private and council.     
  { Ganstead Lane}has privately-owned  
{houses}and{bungalows}which vary in    
 price from Â£30,000 to Â£50,000. Few of 
 the{houses}are built in similar styles
 and fewer built at similar times      
 (some as early as the 1930's). Often  
 the homes are in groups(eg. 3 detached
 houses). Most have garages and large  
 gardens.                              
                                       
{ Longhill}and{Bilton Grange}are both  
{council estates}which are 25 years old
 and were designed around a main road  
 and a shopping area. The{houses}are   
 terraced, arranged with about 40 to a 
 street. There are gardens at both the 
 front and back. All the{houses}are in 
 the same design, but the inhabitants  
 have had the chance to buy their homes
 resulting in changes to the exterior. </content>
