		<title>15MOTORWAYS</title>
		<content> A Motorway is where vehicles go and   
 the motorway has got six separate     
 lanes, 3 one way and three go the     
 other way. Motorways are built because
 it's a quicker way of going to work or
 making deliveries. There aren't any   
 bends to slow you down,and there are  
 no traffic lights or zebra crossings  
 to cause stoppages.  Cars, vans and   
 trucks travel on the motorway, but    
 more cars are on the motorway than    
 other vehicles because there are more 
 people with cars than other vehicles. 
   Motorways must not be used by       
 pedestrians, people learning to drive,
 cyclists or drivers of mopeds.  You   
 are not allowed to reverse, turn round
 or stop except in an emergency.       
 Neither must you go over the speed    
 limit of seventy miles per hour. When 
 it is wet or foggy, your speed must be
 kept down to a safe level.            </content>
