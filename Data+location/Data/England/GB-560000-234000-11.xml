		<title>11BIRDS IN THE SAMPFORDS</title>
		<content> The most common birds in The Sampfords
 are Sparrows and Wood Pigeons.  A     
 Kingfisher has been every year near   
 the River Pant but it has not been    
 seen this year as yet.  The most      
 beautiful birds in The Sampfords are  
 the Kingfisher, the Mallard Drake and 
 the Cock Pheasant.  The biggest bird  
 is the Grey Heron.  In the woods are  
 Tawny Owls.  Barn Owls are quite rare 
 but there are some around.  Also in   
 the woods there is a Nightingale.     
 This has been heard by the village    
 people.  There have been two rare     
 visitors.  These are the Reed Bunting 
 and the Coal Tit.  They came for the  
 food we put out daily.
