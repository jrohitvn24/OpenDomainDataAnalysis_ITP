 1. How old were you when your first   
 job was at Stewartby?{                
{About 30 years old. I started about   
{1930, and carried on until 1965.      
 2. Did World War Two (1939-45)        
 interrupt your job?                   
{No, I was too old for active service, 
{but I did have to serve in the Home   
{Guard (volunteer territorials).}      
 3. Why did you go to Stewartby?       
{The brickyard was the only place to   
{get a good job, with fair money in the
{1930's, especially when I had four    
{children to look after.}              
 4. Do any of them work there?{        
{No, there are too many other jobs     
{today which were not around then. Two 
{of them live in Australia, anyhow. }
