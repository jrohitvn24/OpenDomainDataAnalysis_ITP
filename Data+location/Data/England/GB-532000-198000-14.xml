		<title>14LOCAL HISTORY, ENFIELD</title>
		<content> Enfield is a northern suburb of       
 London. It was once part of the county
 of Middlesex, which exists now only as
 a postal district.                    
 The area around Brigadier Hill has a  
 recent housing development in the form
 of flats. The rest of the housing     
 tends to be the traditional three     
 bedroomed semi-detached or terraced   
 house.                                
 The area to the north of St. Lukes    
 parish church is less residential and 
 given over in the main to public parks
 and private farmland. There are horse 
 riding schools in this farmland area. 
 Further to the north is the M25, the  
 motorway route that will eventually   
 completely encircle London.           
 Most families have the usual          
 electrical consumer goods, go away on 
 holiday at least once a year and have 
 access to a car.                      </content>
