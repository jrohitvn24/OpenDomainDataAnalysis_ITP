		<title>18VILLAGE SCHOOL CLOSES</title>
		<content> Set back from the old A604(now        
 bypassed) stands a lovely old redbrick
 building.Its arched doorways,and high 
 gables are typical of the Board       
 Schools built in the area around a    
 hundred years ago.At one time the     
 infants had one small room, and the   
 junior boys and girls were srictly    
 segregated.Next to it stands the      
 "schoolmasters house"in a similar     
 style. For over a century children    
 from the village and outlying farms   
 had gathered here to begin and often  
 end their education.By 1980 the       
 numbers were sadly diminishing, and it
 was decided that the school must      
 close. There were just 17 children on 
 roll, this was a sad blow for the     
 village,1985, the end of an era. The  
 last few children were transferred to 
 Camps, or Linton. The local council   
 bought the school for a village hall. </content>
