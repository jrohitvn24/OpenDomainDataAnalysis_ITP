		<title>09WESTMILL FARM, WARE</title>
		<content>   Mr.Vigus has farmed here for over 43
 years. In the past he kept cows and at
 one time had 1000 pigs but now it is a
{sheep farm.}His 350 ewes averaged 1.8 
 lambs this year. At 12 weeks old each 
 lamb fetches Â£45 when sold for meat.  
   One shepherd is employed and extra  
 hands are hired for harvesting and for
 shearing in June.{Shearing}takes three
 minutes per sheep.Each fleece is worth
 Â£4. The sheep are{dipped}in July and  
 September to rid them of sheep scab.  
   The shepherd trains{15 dogs}and has 
 won sheepdog trials.He grazes sheep on
 60 acres, moving them around every ten
 days. Although there are over 80 acres
 of grassland,not all of it is healthy.
 (See page 8). One field grazes horses.
   The farmer also has 50 acres of land
 growing{rape,wheat and barley}which he
 rotates each year. He first grew rape 
 four years ago.                       </content>
