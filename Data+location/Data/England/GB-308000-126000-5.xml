		<content> Wiveliscombe is looking forward to its
 new health centre.It is hoped that it 
 will be opened early in 1986,with     
 three consulting rooms,a treatment    
 room,a nurses room and dispensary. The
 most common illness in local children 
 are coughs,measles and chicken pox.In 
 adults high blood pressure and flu.The
 number of patients per doctor is 1600.
 They cover an area going as far as    
 Upton,Ashbrittle&lt;Stawley and Bradford 
 on Tone. Dr.Watson retired in 1984 and
 he misses his work,mostly meeting     
 people and being able to help them.He 
 didn't like problems he couldnt solve.
 His replacement,Dr.Rostrum,was born in
 Cornwall and used to work in          
 Wiltshire.Dr.Hoe and Dr.Rees find it  
 very sad that Dr.Watson is no longer  
 with them although they get on well   
 with Dr.Rostrum.The average age at    
 death of people in Wiveliscombe is 70.</content>
