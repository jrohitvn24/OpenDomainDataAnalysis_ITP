		<content> Clyst St Lawerence is a small village 
 on the outskirts of Clyst Hydon.It has
 a church which is probably Norman.The 
 coat of arms is Charles the second.   
 There is a painting opposite the coat 
 of arms is interesting and maybe the  
 only one in Devon.Walkey's cottage is 
 next to the church.This cottage was   
 bought for Charles Edward Walkey who  
 was the coachman for the Reverent at  
 the time.In the church there are the  
 graves of the family of the coachman. 
 The Old Rectory which is opposite the 
 church and is about eight hundred     
 years old and used to be owned by the 
 Reverent.There is a legend to be a    
 secret passage leading from the church
 to Upton farm.For Upton farm used to  
 be owned by a group of monks who when 
 they went to church they did not like 
 to be seen so they dug a tunnel as the
 legend says.                          </content>
