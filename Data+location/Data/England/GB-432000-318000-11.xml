		<title>11Two Small Schools</title>
		<content> In our area there are only 2 small    
 schools.There used to be 3 but the    
 Primary school in Smisby had to close 
 down because there weren't enough     
 children between 5 and 11 to keep it  
 open.                                 
                                       
 In Hartshorne there is a small Primary
 school.The children are aged 5-11 some
 of them have to go a long way to      
 school especially the children who    
 live in the farms.When the children   
 are 11 they have to go to Granville   
 school in Woodville which is 3 miles  
 away.In Blackfordby school the        
 children are aged 5-8.When they are 8 
 they move to Woodville Junior school, 
 3 miles away.The children have to go  
 by bus.                               
 There are no secondary schools in our 
 area.There is a play group at Blackfo-
 rdby for children under 5.            </content>
