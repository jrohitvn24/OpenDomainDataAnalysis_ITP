		<title>01A PATCH OF RURAL NORTH WILTS</title>
		<content> This is a quiet peaceful patch of     
 north Wiltshire lying just south of   
 the water-filled gravel pits of the   
 Cotswold Water Park, and the infant   
 Thames. To the north are the villages 
 of Ashton Keynes and the Leigh        
 (pronounced Lie), part of which       
 extends into the block. To the west is
 the village of Minety, to the south-  
 west the town of Purton and to the    
 north-east the town of Cricklade.     
 The land is fairly flat and almost    
 entirely used to rear dairy and beef  
 cattle. It is crossed by two minor    
 roads and the railway line from       
 Swindon to Gloucester which has no    
 nearby halt. The block contains an old
 people's home, one shop incorporating 
 a sub-post office, one public house   
 and a Methodist Chapel which is served
 by visiting clergy.
