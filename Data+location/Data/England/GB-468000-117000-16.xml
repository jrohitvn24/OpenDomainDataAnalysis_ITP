		<title>16ARTS AND CRAFTS IN CLANFIELD</title>
		<content> The Country Park Centre is used as a  
 venue for visiting craftsmen to       
 demonstrate their particular skills.A 
 keen public interest is taken in the  
 display of traditional crafts.Spinning
 and weaving on a hand loom is shown   
 through all the stages from the       
 preparation of the raw fleece to the  
 wool ready for use.Hand tooled        
 decorative leatherwork especially     
 belts are in great demand as are the  
 original designs of sterling silver   
 ware.Life_like,accurately coloured    
 carvings of the birds common to the   
 park make attractive gifts for        
 sale together with the hand painted   
 pottery ware.The ancient craft of the 
 wattle hurdle maker is demonstrated in
 the forestry display area.Future plans
 include open air theatre productions  
 staged in natural settings in the     
 park  and outdoor art classes.        </content>
