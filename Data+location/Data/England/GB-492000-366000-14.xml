		<content>  Marconi Electronic Devices moved to  
 Doddington Road in 1981 and currently 
 employs 794 people,but is still       
 expanding and hopes to take on more.  
  The factory at Doddington Road has 2 
 divisions,Microwave(including Hybrid) 
 and Integrated circuits with a Lincoln
 design centre capable of semi-custom  
 design for Very Large Scale           
 Integration.                          
  The microwave division makes radio   
 frequency amplifiers and switches     
 which are used as part of airfield    
 surveillance and missile defence radar
 systems.                              
  The integrated circuit division      
 deals with silicon chips which are    
 used in telecommunications,T.V.sets   
 and more recently touch screen        
 systems.
