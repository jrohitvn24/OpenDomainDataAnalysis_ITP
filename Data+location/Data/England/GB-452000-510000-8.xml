		<title>08Quarry Hill Farm, Gt.Ayton</title>
		<content>  This farm is Known as Quarry  Hill   
 Farm.Its 125 acres are owned by       
 Mr.&amp; Mrs. Whitwell, but farmed in     
 conjunction with the 80 acres of      
 Tree Bridge Farm across the main  A172
 road to the west.                     
  There are 200 ewes on the farm  which
 have had 350 lambs: about average for 
 the area. Mr. Whitwell also fattens   
 calves on cultivated grassland,       
 although he doesn't own them. His     
 Collie  dog is only a guard dog  and  
 his black Labrador his gun-dog. He has
 a lot of trouble with vandals from    
 nearby Middlesbrough damaging his     
 fences.He works full-time in the city 
 leaving the farm organisation to his  
 wife.                                 
  There is a line of old basalt        
 quarries through the farm, now being  
 filled and reclaimed for trees. A     
 water-filled hole is fished by locals.</content>
