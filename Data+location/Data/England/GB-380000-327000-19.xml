		<title>19The History of Eccleshall</title>
		<content> Following the{Norman Conquest,}Eccle- 
 shall Manor was held by the Bishop of 
 Lichfield and Chester, with other     
 lands held by Robert of Stafford, from
 whom they again became subdivided     
 among the Normans. A church is believ-
 ed to have stood here 300 years prior 
 to this, and probably accounts for the
 name derivation ("meadowland next to a
 church"). Lying midway between Lich-  
 field and Chester, Eccleshall was     
 ideally suited for the building of a  
 bishop's castle; most of the town's   
 subsequent history revolves round     
 these ecclesiastical connexions. A    
 number of bishops are buried here.    
 During the{civil wars}the castle was  
 held in siege by the Parliamentary    
 force garrisoning it, and they later  
 partly demolished it. After the rest- 
 oration the stones were used to build 
 the present house, privately owned.   </content>
