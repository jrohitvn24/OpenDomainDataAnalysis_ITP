		<title>03LOCAL HISTORY: Walshaw Hall</title>
		<content>   There has been a house on the site  
 since early 18th Century, but the     
 present hall was built in 1853.It was 
 a family home until 1946 when it was  
 taken over by the Freemasons and made 
 it into an old peoples' home.In 1978  
 the MacPherson group took over for    
 conferences and functions.They had to 
 repair the roof, walls and floor.     
   The Finnish government have taken   
 over MacPhersons but the hall will    
 still be used for conferences.Each    
 room for hire has a different price   
 depending on size and time of year.   
   There are some foreign plants which 
 arrived when seeds got stuck to cotton
 used in local mills.Some are so rare  
 they are not allowed to be            
 shown.Other plants include bamboo,    
 chinese witch hazel and a monkey      
 puzzle tree.The wildlife includes     
 badgers, rabbits owls and woodpeckers.</content>
