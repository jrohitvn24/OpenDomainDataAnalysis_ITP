		<content>  This block accurately reflects the   
 principal features of Wiltshire.There 
 is a high preponderance of prosperous 
 agricultural land _ this is           
 successfully used for both arable and 
 dairy farming.                        
  Chippenham was originally a market   
 town.Today it is a major shopping     
 centre and is the base for the        
 District Council.The population has   
 grown from about 4000 in 1939 to over 
 20000.New housing and industry        
 continues to boost the size and wealth
 of Chippenham and it was recently     
 nominated on a Channel 4 TV programme 
 for the ten towns most likely to be   
 successful for the rest of this       
 century.                              
  The latest recreational facilities   
 are Chippenham Harriers and           
 Bodybuilder's Gymnasium.
