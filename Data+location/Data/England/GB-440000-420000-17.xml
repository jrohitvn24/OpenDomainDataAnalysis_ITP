		<content> The beginning of the Centenary Year   
 brought a succession of visitors who  
 recalled and shared with the          
 children their personal memories of   
 the school.These guests were able to  
 span over eighty years in the life of 
 Regent Street School.The children were
 inspired by the various speakers and  
 began various studies about how we    
 used to live.The Centenary Day        
 celebration held on Monday April 20th 
 1985 was the highlight of the year    
 when over 500 people visited the      
 school .This was recorded by Yorkshire
 Television Company for Calender       
 Tuesday.Two concerts were held on that
 day for parents,governors,ex-pupils,  
 ex-staff and officials of the         
 authority where the children's concert
 included readings and songs after     
 which refeshments,Victorian style,    
 were served by the children.          </content>
