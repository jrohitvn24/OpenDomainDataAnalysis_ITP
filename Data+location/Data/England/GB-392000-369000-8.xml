		<content> My name is Nicola Cundiff.I live in   
 Sutton and go to Hollinhey.The school 
 is in Rural surroundings with         
 trees,flowers and shrubs around it.  I
 am in the recorder group and the      
 choir.There is also an small orchestra
 called the Sinfonia.There is an       
 environmental studies area on an      
 inside court which has  flowering     
 shrubs and two fish pools.We also have
 a nature trail within the school      
 grounds which we use for many         
 subjects.We have won the second       
 division at football,are cross country
 champions in boys events last year and
 have a good netball team.I carried out
 a survey in May 1985 and found that14 
 children came to this school from     
 Macclesfield,95 from Sutton,39 from   
 Lyme Green and 33 from Langley.We have
 four teams named Brindley, Hollinshed,
 Tunnicliffe, and Whiston.             </content>
