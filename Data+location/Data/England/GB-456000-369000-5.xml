		<title>05The Welbeck Estate Company</title>
		<content> Welbeck Estate Co.is a private company
 developed from the estate of the Dukes
 of Portland whose present head is Lady
 Anne Bentinck,the daughter of the last
 duke.It invests in stocks and shares ,
 shops and mines etc.and is also the   
 major land owner in the Cuckney area. 
 Since much of the Estate's local land 
 comprises of forest plantations and   
 farmland ,limestone lodges  were built
 to house gamekeepers and other estate 
 workers.                              
 The Estate now employs about 120      
 people and because of this and its    
 role of landlord to a large number of 
 people in the area ,it is held in     
 great respect in the Norton/Cuckney   
 vicinity.                             
 Lady Anne ,like her ancestors,takes an
 active interest in the community ,and 
 the benevolent if rather eccentric    
 ways of the last Duke are well known. </content>
