		<title>19Holbeach Bank Village Fete</title>
		<content> The playing field fete is held once _ 
 every year. It is one of the biggest  
 attractions around here. It has       
 stalls, games and displays. The money 
 raised goes into the  maintenance of  
 the village hall and playing field.   
 Our school's gymnasts normally do a   
 display. The gym display included     
 vaulting and separate routines. There 
 was a band called the Spalding        
 Boys'and Girls' Brigade Band. This    
 year the fete raised nearly Â£ 300.    
 There were races and a fancy dress    
 competition with money prizes. It     
 attracts a lot of people and they     
 nearly all take part in the           
 activites.The fete starts at 2.30 pm  
 and ends at 6.00 pm. There were plenty
 of refreshments of various kinds.     
 There was a coconut shy and a bowling 
 game and a throw the rolling pin      
 competition.                          </content>
