		<title>12PLAYTIME AT KNEESALL SCHOOL</title>
		<content> There are three classes in the school 
 and the children play in mixed groups 
 in the playground and on the field    
 when the weather is fine. In wet      
 weather it is too muddy to play on the
 field.If we stay indoors, we talk to  
 our friends or draw.                  
  Outside we play lots of different    
 games. In cold weather the boys       
 usually play a game of football or a  
 chasing game that keeps them warm.The 
 girls like to run about and play Tiggy
 round the buildings.When summer comes 
 we play cricket or practise sports.   
 Then the girls can play pretend games 
 with their dolls and make houses and  
 dens out of the grass cuttings.       
  Sometimes we just sit and talk to our
 friends or watch the people going by  
 or the animals in the fields near to  
 the playground.
