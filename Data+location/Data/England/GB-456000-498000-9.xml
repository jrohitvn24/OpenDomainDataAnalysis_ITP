		<title>09HOMELIFE.A DAY IN MY LIFE.</title>
		<content> Friday 31st May I had shreddies and a 
 slice of toast for breakfast.After    
 breakfast I looked out of the window  
 it was sunny with a little breeze. My 
 family and I went to Middlesbrough, we
 arrived at 10-45am, our parking ticket
 said we had to return in 2 hours.We   
 looked at different shops,for an      
 outfit for a wedding.I also wanted to 
 spend my pocket money.I bought a new  
 watch strap, a rope and wood to make a
 rope ladder.It was my Grandad's       
 birthday so we bought presents for    
 him.When we arrived home there were 2 
 firemen called Jeff and George, they  
 had been doing the White Rose Wallk   
 and were staying the night.           
 For tea we had chicken, flan, potatoes
 salad and Chocolate Roulade.After tea 
 Daddy put the rope ladder up the tree.
 We fed the lambs, then I went to bed.
