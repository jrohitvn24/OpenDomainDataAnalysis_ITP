		<title>05Hatfield School.</title>
		<content>{Hatfield School}was opened in 1953 in 
 College Lane, in buildings which are  
 now part of the{Hatfield Polytechnic.}
 It started as a Grammar school with   
 120 boys and girls (entrance was via  
 exam),although it soon grew to about  
 900.The school was unusual as it      
 offered German instead of Latin.      
    Girls did needlework and cooking;  
 boys did woodwork and metalwork.First 
 year boys wore caps and shorts.The    
 1956 School  Magazine reports         
 enthusiastically of the third year    
 ballroom dancing club!                
    In 1971 the school moved to new    
 premises in{Travellers Lane,}and at   
 this time it became an all ability    
 school.The{Hatfield Squash Club}is in 
 the school grounds.Pupils make full   
 use of it and squash is extremely     
 popular.Many play successfully in the 
 schools' league and at a higher level </content>
