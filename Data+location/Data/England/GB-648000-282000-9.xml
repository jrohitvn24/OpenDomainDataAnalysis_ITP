		<title>09The painter and Decorator</title>
		<content>   Painting and decorating are skillful
 jobs. You have to have the right      
 measurements and the right colours    
 that people want. In painting you     
 sometimes have to paint windows but   
 before you do it you sometimes have to
 make them smooth with sandpaper and   
 you sometimes have to put putty in the
 cracks on the windows. In painting and
 decorating youdon't choose the        
 wallpaper. The people tell you what   
 they want and you have to be very     
 accurate when you put the wallpaper   
 up. Before you start the job you have 
 to work out how much it will be.
