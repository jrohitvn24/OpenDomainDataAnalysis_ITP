		<content> Barrowby Church was built in about    
 1220 but there's evidence of a        
 previous Saxon Church on the same     
 site.In the tower there are six bells 
 and the oldest dates from 1600 and    
 was made in Nottingham. There are     
 three services on Sunday and about a  
 hundred people go to them.The Rector  
 has been a rector since 1954 but not  
 always at Barrowby Church.He has been 
 at Barrowby since 1957.He wears       
 different coloured clothes for the    
 different seasons and for ordinary    
 Sundays he wears green. Barrowby      
 parish is much bigger than Barrowby.It
 covers the whole of Barrowby and some 
 small farms and villages around.
