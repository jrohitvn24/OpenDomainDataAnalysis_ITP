		<title>05The River Avon Stratford</title>
		<content> The River Avon meanders from east to  
 west.It is a centre for Recreation and
 leisure activities.Coarse fishing is  
 very popular and many anglers line the
 banks.Barges,motor boats,launches,as  
 well as canoes,punts,and rowing boats 
 pass back and forth full of tourists  
 and holidaymakers.There is an annual  
 Raft Race.In 1985 the race was from   
 Wasperton to Stratford.There were over
 40 rafts with most of the competitors 
 entering for fun with the aim of just 
 finishing the course.Many fell off    
 when they went over the weir!There is 
 also an annual Regatta over a 750m    
 course between Stratford Mill and the 
 Boat Club.In 1985 Stratford were one  
 of the 45 clubs taking part.Altogether
 159 crews entered and the Stratford   
 crew won the final by a length.There  
 are very few swans left on the river  
 and much debate as to why this is so. </content>
