		<content> Along the hedgerows &amp; fields there is 
 much wild life to be observed.        
 Rabbits, Hare &amp; Fox lie side by side  
 &amp; survive the farmers activities very 
 well.  Plenty of common birds such as 
 Sparrow, Thrush, Blackbird, Yellow    
 Hammers, Wagtails &amp; Wren are all      
 prevelent in this part of the country.
 Noticeable are an abundance of Gulls  
 which live inland all the year round &amp;
 speckle the fields with white patches 
 on newly ploughed ground.  Pheasant,  
 Partridge, Pigeon &amp; Magpies seem more 
 apparent each year in the trees.      
 Due to Dutch Elm disease, trees are   
 disapearing quite frequently, &amp; it is 
 hoped many more will be planted in the
 future to house the wild life.  In    
 woodland there are many interesting   
 features not commonly observed during 
 daylight hours.  There are badgers    
 present, with sets clearly visible.   </content>
