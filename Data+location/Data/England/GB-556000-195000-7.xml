		<content> Navestockside is a village west of the
 Ongar Road.The houses to the east of  
 the village green which is laid out as
 a cricket ground with a pavilion were 
 built mostly in brick and pebbledash  
 and plaster in the l8th and l9th      
 centuries but have since been         
 modernized.Traditionally in the summer
 there are garden shows and fetes      
 centred on the village hall built in  
 l920.Everyone interviewed in the      
 village was in possession of a t.v.   
 set a car, more than one stereo and a 
 fridge.Each of the houses were mostly 
 detached and semi detached, had more  
 than seven rooms including toilet and 
 bathroom, and a front and back        
 garden.People worked locally and      
 shopped in Brentwood.Half the people  
 interviewed went abroad for their     
 holidays, mainly to Europe.Many       
 families owned pets, especially dogs. </content>
