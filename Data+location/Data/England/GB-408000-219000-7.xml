		<content> In this rural part of the Cotswolds   
 there is a rich tapestry of wild      
 flowers and birds. The limestone      
 favours lime loving plants and in some
 years, Bee Orchids and Twayblades are 
 to be found in certain areas. Along   
 the track of the dismantled railway   
 and in the several coppices in the    
 area, Hawthorn, Sycamore, Ash, Elder, 
 Beech and Hazel trees abound, creating
 their own mini environment of wild    
 life. By early September the Squirrels
 are already raiding the Hazel nuts. An
 occasional Buzzard is seen overhead.  
 Several footpaths criss cross the area
 mainly following the edges of the     
 fields and giving lovely views as far 
 as the eye can see. Being 200 to 250  
 metres above sea level, the climate is
 bracing with a gentle breeze blowing  
 on most summer days, turning to a     
 chill wind in winter.                 </content>
