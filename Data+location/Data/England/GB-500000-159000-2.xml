		<content>  The housing in this block is very    
 varied. In{the south-west kilometre-  
{square}alone there are four distinct  
 types. To the north: Large detached   
 houses, mainly 1960s; many unmade     
 roads; a few large Victorian houses,  
 two of which are now schools and one  
 an adult education centre.            
        In the centre:Slightly smaller 
 detached houses dating from the 1940s 
 to the 1950s.                         
        In the south-west:Quite large  
 terraced Victorian/Edwardian houses; a
 large modern pub, The Wheatsheaf; a   
 thin sprinkling of light industry; an 
 oak wood, Horsell Moor.               
        In the south-east: A completely
 different area _ large modern office  
 blocks; a hospital; small terraced    
 Victorian houses with modern infill   
 interspersed with light industry; the 
 McLaren racing car workshop.          </content>
