		<title>01ABBERLEY VILLAGE 1985.</title>
		<content>{  Abberley}is in the county of        
 Hereford{and Worcester,}situated six  
 miles S.W.of Stourport on Severn and  
 west of the River Severn.It is a small
 spread village nestling around the    
 west side of{Abberley Hills,which rise
{between 900 and 1000 feet above sea   
{level.}                               
 From the village you have a marvellous
 panoramic view of rolling hills.This  
 open Country_side spreads from west to
 east,through north.                   
 The village is really split into two  
 parts with the village school at the  
 centre.{The Common}is the newer built 
 up area. Many of the houses are       
 between 15 and 20 years old.The older 
 houses are in the area around the{old 
{church}(St. Michael's) and the{village
{square.}The Council estate built in   
 the 1940's is near St.MAry's Church.
