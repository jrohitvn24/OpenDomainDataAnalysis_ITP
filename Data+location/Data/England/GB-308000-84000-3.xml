		<content>{Otterton Primary School}which is      
 situated by the church, is small      
 with 3 classes and a small            
 playground. This is 70 paces long and 
 is thin at one end and  wide at the   
 other. We have about 60 pupils,       
 and lots of people help to run our    
 school like teachers, dinner          
 ladies,dinnertime supervisor, our     
 secretary and caretaker.              
 We haven't any{school uniform}at the  
 moment,but we will have in September  
 '85. It will be grey skirts for       
 girls,grey trousers for boys  with    
 blue or grey socks and royal blue     
 jumper.                               
    At dinner you can go home or bring 
 a packed lunch, we have school dinners
 but not many people eat them in our   
 school,about 10 out of 60. The meals  
 are brought in from Newton Poppleford 
 Primary School.                       </content>
