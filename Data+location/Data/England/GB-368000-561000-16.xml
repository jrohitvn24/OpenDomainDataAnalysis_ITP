		<title>16Wydon Farm at Haltwhistle.</title>
		<content>    My family have lived at Wydon Farm 
 for over 200 years.  We keep cattle   
 and Swaledale sheep, because the soil 
 is not good enough to grow corn.  My  
 grandad used to grow barley, but my   
 dad grows grass for hay and silage to 
 keep the stock alive in winter.  He   
 has a{Limousin bull}and{Angus cows}to 
 sell beef cattle at Hexham and        
 Carlisle marts.                       
    Two years ago he built a sheep     
 house.  He uses it to keep the mules  
 in for the first half of the winter,  
 then he puts the{Swaledale ewes}in at 
 lambing time because it is easier to  
 keep an eye on them than if they were 
 up on the fell.                       
    This year my dad has 700 lambs.  He
 will keep 35 and sell 665 at the marts
 in the autumn.                        
                                       
                                       </content>
