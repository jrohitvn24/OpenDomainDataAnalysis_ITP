		<title>18The Harbour</title>
		<content> The harbour in Torquay is a very busy 
 place. There are lots of boats, large 
 and small. Around the harbour there   
 are benches so people can sit in the  
 sun and lots of amusement arcades     
 where you can waste your money. There 
 are lots of gift and ice cream shops  
 all over the place which only come to 
 life in the summer. Now a fantastic   
 new marina has been built which brings
 in a large amount of money as most of 
 the boats are worth over Â£25000 and   
 the cars in the car park aren't any   
 old junk (a Bentley, a Porsche etc...)
 Unfortunately the old harbour has a   
 terrible litter problem as all sorts  
 of rubbish from the take-aways and the
 beach collects in there. The stink    
 really is atrocious sometimes. If     
 something isn't done about it Torquay 
 could get a bad name.
