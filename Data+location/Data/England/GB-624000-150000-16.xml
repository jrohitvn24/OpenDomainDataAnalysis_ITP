		<title>16NONINGTON VILLAGE FETE 1985.</title>
		<content>                                       
  On Saturday 22nd. June we had a      
 brilliant fete at the cricket ground. 
 There were these sort of swing boats  
 with ropes that you could pull to go  
 faster and faster. My friend ,Neil    
 Blackford, came on the swingboats with
 me.                                   
  Later on the Canterbury Eagles very  
 kindly put on some music. There was a 
 marquee at the top of the field and it
 had displays of work from our school, 
 the playgroup and local craftspeople. 
  There were tractor rides right up    
 through Fredville Park and the cows   
 thought it was feeding time because we
 were sitting on bales of straw.       
  All around there were different      
 stalls:cakes, plants, hot dogs, ice   
 cream and all sorts of side shows.    
  At the end of the fete there was a   
 Tug-of-War which was won by the girls.</content>
