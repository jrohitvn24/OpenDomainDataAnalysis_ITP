		<title>15Religion in E.Hagbourne</title>
		<content>The church still plays an important    
role in these communities.             
In East Hagbourne there are 2 churches,
St Andrews(Anglican) and the Methodist 
Chapel which was built in 1884. St     
Andrews is an active parish and        
produces a magazine every month with   
general information on events, letters,
meetings etc. Within the church itself 
there are many architectural features  
dating from the 15th century, one of   
the most important is the coat of arms 
of Charles I discovered beneath a      
painting which was being cleaned. This 
probably has a link with the period    
when Charles I took refuge in East     
Hagbourne from the Roundheads.         
Recently there has been much fund      
raising to restore the bellcote of     
which there are only a few left in     
the country. It houses the ancient     
Sanctus bell.                          </content>
