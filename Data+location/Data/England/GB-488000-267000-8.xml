		<content> THE RAILWAY STATION:Five people were  
 interviewed at the railway station and
 the most common opinion was that      
 people liked the station and thought  
 that it was good enough although some 
 thought that too much money had been  
 spent on recent improvements.Most were
 satisfied with the efficiency of the  
 service although one man felt that    
 too much modernisation would spoil the
 character of the station.             
 THE BUS STATION:There is not a proper 
 bus station in the town and most      
 people queueing up made complaints    
 about                                 
 the state of the shelters."Even inside
 the shelters you get wet",said an old 
 man.Another man commented that he     
 thought the shelters and a proper bus 
 station should have been built where  
 the WELLINGBOROUGH COLLEGE is erected.
