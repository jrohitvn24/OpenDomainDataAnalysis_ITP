		<title>13GOOSTREY ROSE DAY</title>
		<content> Every year at the end of June Goostrey
 has a Rose day. For the past 79 years 
 people have put on their costumes and 
 joined the colourful parade to Mill   
 Lane field. The jingle of the Morris  
 dancers is followed by the rousing    
 sound of the brass band. Some of the  
 local children have been practising   
 their dancing since April and now have
 their chance to perform.              
   The retiring Rose Queen crowns her  
 successor and then the maypole dancers
 begin. They are reputed never to have 
 tangled the ribbons. There are side   
 stalls,a raffle,a tombola,refreshments
 and all the fun of the fair.          
  When the fun is over the local Scout 
 Troop settle down to camp for their   
 second night. Their task is to ward   
 off over enthusiastic revellers who   
 may return to the site.
