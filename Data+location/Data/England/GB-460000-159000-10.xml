		<title>10HOUSING  BEDROOMS</title>
		<content> My bedroom is painted the colour of   
 creamy peach.I like to be different so
 I move my bed from place to place.I   
 don't like my bedroom to be in a mess 
 but very often it is.My bedroom is    
 upstairs and my curtains are flowery. 
 On one side of the bedroom is a desk. 
 Next to the desk there is a wardrobe. 
 On top of the desk there are two      
 shelves. On one of the shelves I keep 
 books and talc. On the higher shelf I 
 keep little ornaments like dolls from 
 different countries.On my desk I have 
 things like school books and a folder 
 with gym certificates and medals.Most 
 of the time I do my homework on my    
 desk but sometimes I do it on my bed. 
 When I am really tired I do my        
 homework actually in bed.I have a     
 funny habit because when ever my      
 friend is around I always start tidyin
 up.I also keep things under my desk.  </content>
