		<title>01The Village of Collingham</title>
		<content> Collingham is a large village with a  
 population of over 2500.There are more
 than 1000 houses,many of them built   
 during the last 15 years.The village  
 was once distinctly{North Collingham} 
 and{South Collingham}but over the     
 years a gradual merging has taken     
 place.Large estates,both council and  
 private have been built on the eastern
 side with development now reaching    
 saturation point.Because of           
 this,Collingham now boasts a{modern   
{health centre and library}            
 .Conversely,there are very few shops  
 as the majority of people now do their
 shopping in the supermarkets of Newark
 and nearby Lincoln.                   
 Situated a kilometre or more east of  
 the River Trent,often there is        
 flooding,usually in the older part of 
 the village.Much of the old village is
 now a{conservation area.}             </content>
