		<content> At the end of Pytches Road are the    
 council offices. My dad goes there    
 occasionally,to meetings with council 
 officials.My dad is a council worker  
 and is employed by Suffolk Coastal    
 District Council.He works at the      
 Woodbrige depot with many other people
 who also work for the council.His work
 involves digging, hoeing, planting    
 seeds, cutting the grass and pricking 
 out seedlings for the parks around    
 Woodbridge.I think the borders that   
 they dig and hoe look very attractive 
 when they have finished working       
 there.My dad and the other men with   
 him don't just work in Woodbridge,    
 they work at other places as well -   
 Leiston, Ufford, and even as far as   
 Felixstowe. In the summer the public  
 borders look beautiful and many       
 visitors admire them.
