		<content>   St. Oswald's Old Church, according  
 to available records, was first       
 dedicated in 1349, though a survey    
 made by Dr. Eric Gee some years ago   
 revealed that it was built in about   
 1150, the first Norman church in this 
 area.                                 
   It continued to serve its           
 parishioners until the present parish 
 church was built in 1866 and it was   
 finally declared redundant in         
 1973, when the costs of maintaining it
 became too great.                     
   At that time, however, an           
 application was made to convert the   
 church into a private home. Work began
 almost immediately, with care being   
 taken to preserve the atmosphere of   
 the original church. The graveyard was
 cleared and the tombstones were       
 erected around the perimeter wall.
