		<content> We  sent out questionnaires to houses 
 on our map area.Most of the people who
 had the leaflets replied,but a few    
 did not.A lot did not have any        
 occupation at all, and some were      
 retired.Out of the replies,four       
 people,worked in{Ashbourne}.One person
 in{Parwich},two were farmers,another  
 two did not state their whereabouts   
 of work,and seven people did not work.
 The jobs that people had were market  
 traders,physiotherapists,a plastering 
 contractor,a production sales manager,
 a construction supervisor,lorry       
 driver,computer programmer,a          
 mechanical engineer and a motor       
 mechanic.
