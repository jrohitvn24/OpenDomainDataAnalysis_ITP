		<content>     Mrs.Vera Rigby lives in Croftlands
 and is a store detective.             
     She works for Group 4 Total       
 Security. The stores she works for are
 B&amp;Q, Woolworths and the Co-op, but she
 can also work in other shops when off 
 duty by using a thing called citizen's
 arrest.                               
     She checks the orders, fire safety
 and sometimes even the cashiers. She  
 goes round shops looking for people   
 picking things up and putting them in 
 their pockets or even up their        
 jumpers! She then follows them round  
 till they go out of the door without  
 paying.Then she stops them,tells them 
 who she is,and asks the manager of the
 shop if he wants to call the police.  
 If the police come the thief goes to  
 court and the stolen object acts as   
 evidence.                             
            Andrew aged 9.             </content>
