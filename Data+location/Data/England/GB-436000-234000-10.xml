		<content>  LODGE FARM IS A HOUSE &amp; FARM BUILT IN
 THE VICTORIAN/RED BRICK ERA.{COLONEL &amp;
 MRS.JACKSON (AND HER MOTHER) HAVE     
 LIVED THERE FOR 6 YEARS SINCE HIS     
 RETIREMENT FROM THE ARMY.THE FARM HAS 
 LARGE GROUNDS OF 36-40 ACRES AND THEY 
 BREED CATTLE. IN THE GROUNDS IS A     
 THATCHER'S WORKSHOP AND A HELICOPTER  
 HANGAR FOR MR JACKSON'S OWN           
 HELICOPTER WHICH HE USES TO SPRAY     
 THE FIELDS.THEY SEEM LIKE A VERY      
 TRADITIONAL FAMILY (EVEN THOUGH THE   
 OLD LADY LIKES DURAN DURAN) AS THEIR  
 INTERESTS INCLUDE ANTIQUES AND        
 CLASSICAL MUSIC.                      
 THERE IS AN OLD TALE ABOUT A SECRET   
 TUNNEL WHICH WAS SUPPOSED TO RUN FROM 
 THE FARM TO SWALCLIFFE BUT IT CANNOT  
 BE PROVED AS THE CELLAR ROOF COLLAPSED
 A FEW YEARS AGO.THE ORIGINAL NAME OF  
 THE FARM WAS TURPIN FARM AS DICK      
 TURPIN IS SAID TO HAVE STAYED THERE.  </content>
