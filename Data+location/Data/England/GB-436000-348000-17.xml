 COMMUTING INTO HEAGE.                 
 Many people commute into Heage to work
 at the industry  site,Church Street.It
 has grown from a small family joinery 
 works to a large group of companies   
 which includes civil engineering,plant
 hire and joinery.                     
 COMMUTING AT SCHOOL.                  
 199 pupils.Many children travel by bus
 or car.On Mondays top juniors travel  
 to Ripley pool for swimming lessons.In
 September the fourth year juniors go  
 to Comprehensive schools.I'm sad about
