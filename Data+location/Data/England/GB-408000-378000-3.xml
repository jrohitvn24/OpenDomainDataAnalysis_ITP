		<content> Farming is the main activity in the   
 area with a majority of{mixed dairy   
{and sheep farms.                      
 Most farms are owned and run by a     
 family and  are small to medium       
 sized.They may employ one or perhaps  
 two farmhands who often live  on the  
 farm in a cottage or caravan. Contract
 labour and machinery may be used for  
 collection of silage or hay or at     
 shearing time.Family and friends      
 often help at busy times and farmers  
 often help their neighbours.          
 Markets at Bakewell and Chelford are  
 important meeting places for social as
 well as business reasons.             
 In Winter heavy snows can make life   
 very demanding as fodder has to be    
 taken out to the animals or the       
 animals have to be brought in to      
 shelter.                              
                                       </content>
