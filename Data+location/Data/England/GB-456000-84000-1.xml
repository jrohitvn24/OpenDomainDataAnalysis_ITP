		<content> Mrs Slough came to talk to us about   
 Sandown Youth Centre.  She works as a 
 Youth Leader.                         
 At first they let us have two grotty  
 classrooms in the High{SCHOOL}for the 
{YOUTH CLUB}with no toilets.  Now we   
 use the Town Hall.  The town hall     
 disco room used to be a{MORGUE}where  
 they used to put the dead bodies.     
 They put a nice shiny floor for the   
 disco.  Martin Rousse is the boss and 
 there are a lot more helpers. In the  
 games room  they've got a big floor   
 for rough games and there is a stage  
 when you take the boards out.         
 In the changing room for the girls    
 there's a door.  That door is a fire  
 exit door but people say there's a    
{GHOST}down there, but there isn't     
 really.  We have two snooker tables,  
 one for snooker and one for pool.
