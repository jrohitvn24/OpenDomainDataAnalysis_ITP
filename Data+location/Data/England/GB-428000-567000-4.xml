		<content>Parkside Special School caters for 63  
pupils between the ages of 2 and 19yrs,
all with severe learning difficulties. 
The school (built in 1978)is situated  
in Mullen Road,a residential area of   
Wallsend,but the intake is not limited 
only to Wallsend.Although there are 24 
children in our class,in a Special     
School like Parkside a teacher might   
have the care of as few as 4 children  
because of their individual needs for  
much special attention.                
As a result of their difficulties these
children will not receive the sort of  
education that we take for granted,but 
they do have extra facilities there t  
we do not enjoy,including an on site   
swimming pool.However ,our class all   
agree that they must have everything   
which might help to improve their      
quality of life.
