		<content>   Magog farm surrounds Wandlebury     
 Nature Reserve. The farmer has 412    
 acres including 5 acres of woodland.  
 He has worked it for 40 years, enjoys 
 farming. Membership of COMMON MARKET{ 
 has meant higher prices, increased    
 mechanization and fewer workers. 2 men
 and 1 part-time worker are employed.  
 Mainly arable, half the crops are sold
 by a co-operative, half through       
 merchants. Crossbred heifers          
 (continental mothers and English      
 bulls) are fattened for sale to       
 local Shelford butcher.               
   The farm house was built about 1830.
 The site was used for RACING STABLES  
 until sold as a 'model farm' in 1896. 
   Some 100 yr old hedges surround the 
 farms and divide the fields. Deciduous
 trees are to be seen and a few        
 conifers.
