		<content> Maltby Sports Centre was built in     
 1972.It was the last major project of 
 the West Riding County Council before 
 local government reorganisation.Since 
 1974 it has been run by Rotherham     
 Metropolitan Borough Council.It was   
 originally designed to accommodate    
 swimming,squash,sports hall and       
 gymnasium.However lack of finance has 
 prevented completion of all           
 facilities.The main swimming pool is  
 25m long and 12.5m wide and ranges in 
 depth from 0.9m to 2m. Adjacent is a  
 diving pool 3.8m deep,with spring and 
 high diving boards.There is also a    
 shallow pool for beginners to be      
 taught how to swim.                   
 Other activities at the centre are    
 Karate,Keep fit classes and table     
 tennis.Sunday is the most popular day,
 with about 1000 people swimming and   
 joining in activities.                </content>
