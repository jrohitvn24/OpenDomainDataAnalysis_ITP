		<title>19Crowthorne Carnival</title>
		<content>     {Crowthorne Carnival}has become a 
 bi-annual event. Local traders, clubs,
 schools and individuals take part in  
 the week long festivities. The theme  
 for 1985 was{'Headlines from History'.
      Broadmoor School won the youth   
 section with 'St.George and the       
 Dragon'.The dragon was scaly and green
 with red and yellow spots. Inside were
 lots of children holding up hoops.    
 They said it was hot and stuffy but a 
 lot of fun. The dragon's tail was     
 wriggling about because it was fixed  
 to a skate-board.                     
     After the procession there was a  
{fete}with plenty to watch, buy and    
 do.There was a B.M.X.cycle display, a 
 Wild West Show, Break dancers, the    
 Firemen's display and a bouncy castle.
   During the week there were various  
 sports competitions, a pram race,     
 Flower Festival and Music Festival.   </content>
