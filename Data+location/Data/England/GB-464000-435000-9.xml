		<title>09 Whitemoor Coalmine</title>
		<content>Building began in January 1980 and the 
mine is still under construction. The  
first coalface will be working in 1986.
Coal output is low at the development  
stage, although coal is being produced 
on a pro-rata of 50% coal to 50% rock. 
A rough estimate would be 150-200 tons 
per shift. The National Coal Board     
being such a large customer, there are 
many firms involved with the mine. For 
example, Thysson (GB) are dealing with 
the shafts and tunnels whilst          
Fairclough Construction LTD deal with  
surface buildings. Several firms       
provide the wide variety of machinery. 
This machinery includes a huge grab to 
lift the broken rock into large buckets
to send out of the shaft and drilling  
rigs to probe down to 100 metres for   
water.
