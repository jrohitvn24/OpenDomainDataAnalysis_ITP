		<content> THE GEOLOGY OF THIS AREA IS SIMPLE.A  
 LANDWARD PLATEAU 50 FEET ABOVE SEA    
 LEVEL COMPOSED OF GLACIAL HEAD,       
 OVERLYING THE BEDROCK OF DARTMOUTH    
 SHALES LOCALLY KNOWN AS SHILLET.BOTH  
 THE HEAD AND THE BEDROCK ARE SUBJECT  
 TO EXTENSIVE EROSION,PRIMARILY AS     
 CONTINUAL ACTION BY THE SEA AT THE    
 CLIFF BASE PREVENTS THE DEVELOPMENT OF
 A NATURAL ANGLE OF REPOSE FOR THE SOIL
  MANY SIMPLE BUT EFFECTIVE LOW WALLS  
 HAVE BEEN CONSTRUCTED BY LANDOWNERS.  
 THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES FAVOUR MAJOR    
 CONCRETE SEA WALLS OR LARGE GABION    
 WALLS SUCH AS PRESENTLY BUILT BEHIND  
 THE MAIN BEACH.PLANS ARE IN HAND TO   
 PRODUCE A WALL (IN 5 PHASES) FROM     
 SEATON TO DOWNDERRY BUT THE COST IS   
 CAUSING A DELAY WHICH COULD MEAN THAT 
 THIS D BLOCK WILL HAVE DISAPPEARED    
 BEFORE THE WALL IS IN PLACE.PHASE 1 IS
 BUILT,PHASE 2 IS AT PLAN STAGE !      </content>
