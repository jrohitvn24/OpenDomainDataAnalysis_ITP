		<content>{ }In addition to the various clubs    
 already listed an important role in   
 local life and leisure is played by   
 the school, both by virtue of various 
 after-school activities run by staff  
 and parents and by its flourishing    
 Parent Teacher Association.           
   The out-of-school activities        
 currently include netball or rounders 
 (depending on the season), needlework,
 gardening, computer club and Saturday 
 morning swimming.                     
   The PTA organises educational       
 meetings, social functions and fund-  
 raising events. As well as paying the 
 running costs of the swimming pool,   
 the financial support of the PTA makes
 possible regular educational visits   
 for the children, provides books and  
 equipment and meets numerous minor    
 school expenses throughout the year.
