		<title>12CHANGING TIMES IN DEWSBURY</title>
		<content> 20 years ago the major industry was   
 textile manufacturing of woollen yarns
 rags and industrial wipers.Some mills 
 employed as many as 500 workers.Over  
 the years the textile industry has    
 been declining, due to reduced demand,
 foreign competition and adverse       
 currency exchange rates.So the last 10
 years has seen the industry modernise 
 and streamline its operations using   
 more efficient machinery and less     
 labour. Textiles still remain the     
 dominant industry-30% of Eastborough  
 children's fathers find employment    
 here-but there has been a greater     
 diversification of industry into      
 engineering,printing and garage       
 services.Whilst Dewsbury's population 
 has remained static,there has been a  
 move away from inner-town housing,and 
 workers are more ready to travel to   
 nearby cities to find employment.     </content>
