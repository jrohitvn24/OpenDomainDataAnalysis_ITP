 for repairing and modernising council 
 houses in the city of Sheffield.      
                                       
    The Eastern Area depot serves      
 the Woodthorpe and Manor areas.The    
 office had recently installed a       
 computer connected to the Town Hall   
 to receive details of repairs.There   
 was a large store of things like roof 
 tiles,bricks, baths, pipes and snow   
 clearing vehicles.                    
                                       
    The houses in the area around      
 Woodthorpe and Manor are all being    
 modernised at present. They are       
 putting in new windows and doors ,new 
 gas and electric metels ,new roofs,   
 new inside walls. Some of the houses  
 are too unsafe to repair because of   
 the kind of mortar they used in houses
 just after the second world war.      </content>
