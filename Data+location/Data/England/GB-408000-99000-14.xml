		<title>14HOME LIFE TYPICAL SATURDAY</title>
		<content> On Saturday I get up very early to go 
 to the garage with my Dad.  It takes  
 about 15 minutes to get there because 
 we stop at the newsagent for a paper. 
 Dad opens the door and the alarm goes 
 off. He turns it off. I open the      
 petrol pumps and pull the OPEN sign   
 over to the pavement. I rush back in  
 and open the workshop to get out the  
 barbecues, patio sets and the oil     
 rack.  Dad always gets the gardening  
 rack out because it is too heavy for  
 me. Next I read the newspaper for half
 an hour. When customers come, Dad lets
 me serve them. They give the money to 
 me and I put it in the till. Sometimes
 "Mike the Trike" comes in. He has the 
 oldest trike in Britain and is very   
 funny. He sometimes gives me a ride on
 his trike. At one o'clock we lock     
 everything up and go home to have our 
 lunch.                                </content>
