		<title>15  In the news (Aldridge)</title>
		<content> Articles in the local press in the    
 week ending Friday, June 28, 1985 were
 very varied. One issue hitting the    
 headlines continually is that of a    
 proposed motorway near to the Copy    
 Hall estate. Local residents have     
 formed an action commitee to fight the
 proposals and are displaying many     
 anti-motorway posters in their        
 windows.                              
 Local residents were warned this week 
 by Aldridge Police to be on their     
 guard, following a series of cash and 
 jewellery thefts from homes, one in   
 Little Aston Road.                    
 Less seriously a local hairdresser cut
 a ladies hair up in a hot air balloon 
 to raise money for charity. The Elms  
 Pub held a Rod Stewart lookalike      
 contest.                              
 In sport Aldridge cricket club        
 continued it's run of success.        </content>
