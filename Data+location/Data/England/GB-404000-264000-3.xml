		<content> the radio.At first people did not     
 believe it would happen but then      
 surveyors started tramping across     
 their land without the farmers        
 permission and this caused bad        
 feelings.The people of the area {     
{protested}that in making Redditch a   
 New Town they were being turned out of
 their homes but they were told that   
 other people needed homes too so in   
 1968 they had to move.They were given 
{Â£32,000,the market value of the land  
{but no disturbance money was paid.For 
{Â£32,000 today you could buy one       
{detached house.}                      
  Mr Burrows bought another farm in    
 Cookhill and later, when she had left 
 college, his elder daughter came to   
 teach at{Moatfield Middle School}where
 she taught the children of New Town   
 Redditch.
