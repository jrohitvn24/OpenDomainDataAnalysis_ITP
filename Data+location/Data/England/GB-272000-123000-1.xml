		<content>{Domesday Project.By Alison and Katy.  
   In our Domesday Project we have done
 all sorts of projects like housing,   
 farming,local news,churches and Post  
 Offices.Some children have been out   
 interviewing some of the people in our
 village.We have been on walks along   
 the lanes and taking photos of the    
 country side. There are many farms and
 woods in our area. There are not very 
 many roads,but the roads that are here
 can be busy with tractors and cars.   
   There are many cottages and old     
 houses in the village. There are about
 half a dozen thatched houses in the   
 village so most of them have tiles or 
 slate.                                
   There are two small rivers in our   
 area called{the River Yeo and River   
{Mole.}Most of the land is steep and   
 hilly.There is one school in our area 
 which is our school.                  </content>
