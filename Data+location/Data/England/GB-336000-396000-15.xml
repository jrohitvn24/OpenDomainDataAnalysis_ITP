		<title>15AINTREE RACECOURSE HISTORY</title>
		<content> The originator of the{Grand National  
 was William Lynn, an innkeeper and    
 owner of the Waterloo Hotel Liverpool.
 He advertised for a race to be run on 
 February 29th 1836 "A sweepstake of 10
 sovereigns each, with 80 sovereigns   
 added for horses. Winner to be sold   
 for 200 sovereigns if demanded". In   
 1857, Lynn secured the support of     
 Liverpool Corporation who contributed 
 100 sovereigns towards the stake      
 money.                                
   From only 4 starters in 1837        
 (just 2 completed the course), the    
 number of starters steadily increased 
 and in 1971 the number of starters was
 38. Only 13 finished showing what a   
 challenge the{Grand National}is.      
 The race was nationalised in 1945 and 
 five years later "wizard" Topham      
 leased the course from Lord Sefton.
