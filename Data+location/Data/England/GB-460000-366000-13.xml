		<title>13THE LIBRARY</title>
		<content>     {Edwinstowe Public Library}is in  
 the High Street and was built in 1971.
 The library assistant told us she had 
 been working in libraries for sixteen 
 years.{60%}of the clients are{old age 
{pensioners}and like light fiction.    
      Three other people work with her 
 and they are all used to dealing with{
{tourists}asking where {Robin Hood     
 lives.{Rufford}pupils who live in     
 Edwinstowe go for Homework books and  
 many five and six year olds go to     
 borrow six books at a time.           
     On a normal day seventy clients   
 visit the library to borrow,return or 
 research information. As well as books
 they have a{microfiche reader}to do   
 bibliographic research.{Old parish    
{records}can be read on the reader if  
 arrangements are made to borrow them  
 from Ollerton.                        
                                       </content>
