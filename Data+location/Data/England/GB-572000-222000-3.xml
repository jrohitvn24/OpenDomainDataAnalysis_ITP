		<content>    With the long awaited decision on  
 London's third airport to be made,    
 every week saw a new report in the    
 local paper either proclaiming the    
 idea or stating how bad it would be   
 for the towns. Now the choice has been
 made to expand this aerodrome from a  
 half to eight million passengers per  
 year both camps are assessing the     
 situation.                            
    On the disadvantage side are the   
 increase in noise levels, which are   
 feared, and the steady build up of    
 traffic on the already overcrowded    
 roads. The plus side balances these   
 two problems with the new bypass due  
 to be constructed in the next four    
 years and the increase in trade or    
 house prices.                         
    Asking the inhabitants of the town 
 brought a mixed response but the      
 general attitude was to wait and see. </content>
