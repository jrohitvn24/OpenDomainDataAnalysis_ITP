		<content> The first railway station was situated
 off railway street in 1848 and was    
 part of the Maldon,Witham and         
 Braintree railway in 1869 there opened
 the Bishops Stortford and Dunmow part 
 of the line.A new and existing railway
 station was built south of the old    
 one.Fortunes and use of the railway   
 have varied over the years.Now the    
 line runs from Braintree to Witham    
 with some through trains to Liverpool 
 Street.                               
 The station buildings have remained   
 largely unchanged but only one        
 platform is in use.The old track bed  
 towards Rayne prouides an attractive  
 walk and haven for wild life.
