		<title>17A Local Worry</title>
		<content>The Motorway,M 25 ,which is the most   
recent motorway to be built, and which 
'rings' London, is now complete except 
for the stretch from Hunton Bridge to  
South Mimms,which runs right through   
our area.                              
Near Bricket Wood,there is to be a huge
intersection;the Government bought too 
much land,and there are various        
proposals for its use.One was as a     
hotel and shopping complex,another was 
as warehouses. If it is developed,it   
will be the most valuable piece of land
in Europe --so it is nick-named        
"The Golden Triangle".                 
Local people in Bricket Wood, think it 
should go back to being farmed and are 
worried by the  thought of even more   
traffic comming into the area.
