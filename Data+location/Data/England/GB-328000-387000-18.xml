		<title>18Parents Against Drug Abuse</title>
		<content>   We taped an interview with a mother 
 who  had  become  active  in {Parents 
{Against Drug Abuse }because there had 
 been a problem  within her own family 
 and  she  felt  there  was  no  help  
 available.These are her thoughts.     
                                       
  {The cause of this problem is mainly 
{due to unemployment and boredom."Some 
{children  at  school  are even taking 
{drugs."It can  take  six to  eighteen 
{months to get off drugs.              
   The  age  most affected by drugs is 
 16-25 years.The most affected area is 
 the North End of Birkenhead.          
   If people wanted drugs but couldn't 
 afford them they would steal the money
 even sometimes from their own family; 
 this is leading to split families. So 
 the taking of drugs affects the whole 
 of the family.
