		<content> There are three main areas comprising 
 the landscape.  The USAF Woodbridge   
 Air Base surrounded by wire fences and
 much barbed wire contains defence     
 buildings, a water tower, church and  
 schools; this area is flat. There is  
 some farmland with mixed copses and   
 shelter belts, and a 1939/45 wartime  
 hut. The largest area undulates and is
 covered by heathland merging into     
 coniferous forest. There are broad    
 tracks and footpaths and the forest   
 itself has one metalled road.  The    
 forestry plantations are numbered and 
 a small stream and a valley feeds two 
 reservoirs.  There is the occasional  
 metal hut and water container. A large
 area has been clear-felled and such   
 land is replanted with trees as soon  
 as possible after clearing.
