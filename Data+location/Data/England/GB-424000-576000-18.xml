		<content>   Most people like living in          
 Cramlington. They like having modern  
 housing and new schools for their     
 children but they are sometimes       
 unhappy when they are not ready on    
 time. Everyone likes the big shopping 
 centre near Concordia but some mothers
 wish that there were more shops on the
 estates.                              
                                       
   There are footpaths and cycle tracks
 away from the main roads so it is very
 safe, but some people don't like the  
 underpasses because they often have   
 graffiti on the walls and can be      
 frightening after dark.               
                                       
   Everyone likes using the sports     
 facilities and leisure pool at        
 Concordia.
