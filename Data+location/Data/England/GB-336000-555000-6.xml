		<content>  Etterby has very few houses and a lot
 of fields.The railway&lt;now disused>    
 passes through it and was one reason  
 why houses were built.The Caledonian  
 Buildings were built for the railway  
 workers.There is now a council estate,
 consisting of terraced houses and semi
 detached.The shops are a sweetshop,the
 Co-op ,a newsagent,a Post Office and a
 fish and chip shop.                   
  Three roads lead into the country.   
 Etterby Road has mainly terraced      
 houses,including Caledonian Buildings.
 Stainton Road has semis,old and new,  
 and a plant nursery.It leads to en-   
 closed rough grazing land and a big   
 dairy farm.On the left of Kingmoor    
 Road is Kingmoor Nature Trail.On the  
 right is an old factory and a garage.
