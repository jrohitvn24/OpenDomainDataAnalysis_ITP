		<title>14Trade, Rehabilitation.</title>
		<content> Near Bordon, Firhill Plant Hire, hire 
 out heavy diggers, and a design       
 developement company deals with       
 buildings and developments. The Post  
 Office Stores at Passfield is the only
 shop in the area. It is quite small.  
  The Grange,Standford,a large country 
 house is in use as a rehabilitation   
 centre for recidivists, people on     
 probation or exprisoners. They are    
 taught self sufficiency, by helping in
 the kitchen, in the garden, and with  
 animals. The large grounds provide    
 space and opportunity to rear animals 
 and poultry. Eggs,vegetables and goats
 milk are advertised. It is hoped that 
 some will be able to take jobs where  
 accomodation is also provided.        
 Currently there are 12 men and 2      
 women. The local community makes      
 contact, and a craft centre at the    
 Grange is proposed.                   </content>
