		<title>20ANDREW'S DAY</title>
		<content> I am up before 7.For{breakfast}I only 
 want cereal.We have to go for the bus 
 at 7.45.The bus goes all around the   
 villages before it gets to Cardinham  
 School at 8:30.In the playground we   
 play "chaintig" you have to catch     
 someone then you have to hold hands   
 and catch someone else.School starts  
 at 9.Most people stay to school lunch 
 because they live too far away to walk
 home.School ends at 3:30.We wait until
 the bus comes then we go home.At home 
 there are calves to feed and other    
{jobs}to do.Then{we play until it is   
{dinner time.}We often play in the     
 fields or building dams in the        
 stream.We can also use{the computer.}I
 go to bed at about 8:30.              
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
