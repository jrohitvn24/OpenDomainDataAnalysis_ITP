{Yaxley}is reputed to be the largest   
 village in the country.In recent years
 there has been extensive development  
 but despite its size,{Yaxley}has      
 retained its village atmosphere.      
  Then name {Yaxley}is purely          
 Anglo-saxon.When {Yaxley}first came   
 into existence it overlooked a vast   
 expanse of water known as meres.This  
 has all now been drained and has      
 proved to be the basis of a large     
 farming community.                    
  The {Yaxley}coat of arms consists of:
 Two stags,a cuckoo-{Yaxley }means     
 "Clearing where cuckoos congregate"   
 A shield consiting of a "Y",wheat     
 sheaves and chimneys.                 
 There are also two hatchets dating    
 back to Roman times.                  
 The Motto-"Unity,Work,Progress".
