		<title>14   An arable Farmer</title>
		<content> Mr.Search chose to be an arable farmer
 because of the dry climate and heavy  
 moist soils,these are suitable for    
 arable farming.However he used to keep
 livestock.He owned 350 pigs but the   
 profit was not suitable to keep the   
 farm going.The raw materials were     
 expensive and labour was essential.He 
 owns a small farm or 103 acres off    
 Borwick Lane,Wickford.Three types of  
 crops are grown:rape,wheat and beans. 
 At the moment oil seed rape is grown  
 because it is profitable and in great 
 demand.Wheat is grown because it is a 
 high yeilding and marketable crop.    
 Beans,as like rape are well supported.
 He does not grow barley as it is not  
 profitable.Rotation is practised on   
 this farm to maintain the condition of
 the soil.Mr.Search finds that his     
 biggest outlays are machinery,the cost
 of seed and sprays.                   </content>
