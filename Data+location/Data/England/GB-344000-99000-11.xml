		<content> Spinning:  Ladies meet occasionally   
 for spinning afternoons and practise  
 at home, although only one lives      
 inside the Domesday block.  Yarn is   
 then knitted and there are several    
 weavers in the surrounding area.      
 Pottery: Classes are held at          
 Beaminster School and small potteries 
 either sell the product on site or on 
 stalls in the nearby market town.     
 Painting: Classes are available and   
 various media is used at home.  2 or 3
 people are at the start of            
 professional careers as artists.      
 Ladies home crafts: Patchwork, needle 
 point, braiding, ragrugs, knitting,   
 smocking, crochet and dressmaking are 
 much in evidence and promoted by the  
 W.I. Woodworking: Practised at Parnham
 House with its famous workshop.
