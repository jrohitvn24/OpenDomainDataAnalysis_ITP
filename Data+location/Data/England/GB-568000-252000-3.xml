There is a wide variety of dwellings in
the village. Several farm-houses have  
moats and are believed to be 16th      
century. There are a lot of lath and   
plaster cottages with thatched roofs,  
flint cottages, red bricked houses,    
council houses and bungalows. Several  
buildings are listed grade 2 or 3 under
the Ancient Monuments Act. The primary 
school, Mill House, Bake House, several
public houses and achapel have all been
converted into private homes. Very     
little new building is allowed (and    
then only in the main street) and      
application to the County Council has  
to be made before any alterations or   
enlargements to existing buildings can 
be made.
