		<content> Looking after ones health can be      
 difficult in these rural areas. The   
 nearest group practice is in Saxilby  
 which has five doctors and its own    
 dispensary.There is also a Doctor who 
 has a surgery in Marton. The Doctors  
 will visit in urgent cases, but for   
 those people without transport,       
 getting to the surgery can be a       
 problem. There is a small hospital in 
 Gainsborough and the County hospital  
 is in Lincoln. The nearest dentist is 
 in Gainsborough but there is an       
 Optician in Saxilby. The majority of  
 families are very happy living in the 
 country, although a number of older   
 residents regret the high cost and    
 infrequency of public transport. Both 
 primary and secondary school age      
 children are taken to their schools on
 buses provided by Lincolnshire County 
 Council.                              </content>
