		<content> INDUSTRY- Although Worcester is the   
 County Town of a Shire county there is
 varied industry in this block much of 
 it known world-wide. LEA and PERRINS  
 founded in 1823 make the famous spicy 
 sauce,first sold in 1837 and has been 
 exported since 1840. METAL BOX makes  
 tin plate which is used to manufacture
 cans or tins in which many types of   
 food, meat, vegetables and fruit,and  
 drink, can be preserved. Most famous  
 of Worcester firms must be WORCESTER  
 PORCELAIN manufacturers of fine china 
 for over two centuries. The firm was  
 founded by Dr. John Wall in 1751 and  
 the exquisite pocelain figures are    
 collectors items throughout the world.
 Another industry equally as famous in 
 its day were the Worcester Gloves, but
 changes in fashions during the 1920s  
 when gloves were not worn put this    
 industry and its firms into decline.  </content>
