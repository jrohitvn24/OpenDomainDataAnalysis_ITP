		<title>03Royston Cave.</title>
		<content>   Royston cave was discovered by      
 accident in 1742 by workmen. After a  
 steep descent into the cave there is a
 bell-shaped room carved out of chalk. 
 Historians think that the cave is     
 man-made. The height is about 10      
 metres from the floor to the top.     
 There are carvings in the chalk sides 
 of saints, crucifixes and other       
 historical things. It is unique in    
 Europe, but experts tell us that      
 similar caves have been found in      
 Israel. The main theory is that the   
 cave was used by the Knights Templar. 
 These were a religious order of monks 
 who were crusaders. Our class thought 
 that perhaps cavemen built the cave   
 and did some carvings; or perhaps it  
 was used as a prison or by smugglers. 
 The cave is open for people to visit  
 on certain days and is very           
 interesting.                          </content>
