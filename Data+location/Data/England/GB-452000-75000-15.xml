		<content> The area in question can be broadly   
 sub divided into two. Firstly the area
 to the extreme north west corner known
 as Upper Ventnor and Lowtherville.    
 Here the preponderance is rented local
 authority provided house and flat type
 accomodation. The planners arranged   
 this along with adjacent schools and  
 light industrial units (neither of    
 which come within this area). The     
 majority of the remainder of housing  
 which is for the main piecemeal       
 speculative type development is       
 private and because of the local      
 beauty with repect to landscape and   
 ecology the developments have tended  
 to be of a better quality in a higher 
 than average price range. There is no 
 problem with slum clearance but only  
 with the perennial task of finding    
 suitable building land where          
 permission for housing is possible.   </content>
