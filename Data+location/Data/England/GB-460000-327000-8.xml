		<content> Social activities are often organised 
 by the church in both villages. They  
 recently included cheese and wine, a  
 barbecue and a beetle drive in Widmer-
 pool, which has to use Willoughby Vil-
 lage Hall or borrow the old cricket   
 pavilion, now used by Keyworth rugby  
 club. Wysall has a thriving           
 Conservative Association. The old     
 Wysall School is the Village Hall,    
 used for e.g. the children's Christmas
 party or WEA lectures (a course on    
 herbs and the herb garden starts this 
 winter). Annually a Strawberry Fair   
 with street stalls is held to raise   
 funds for Wysall church. To encourage 
 a community spirit, a fortnightly cof-
 fee morning is held when the mobile   
 library calls. Wysall was runner up in
 the best kept village competition in  
 1984. There is a Methodist youth club.
 The bowls club is in abeyance.        </content>
