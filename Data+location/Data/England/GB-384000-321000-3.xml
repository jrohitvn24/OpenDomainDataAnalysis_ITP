To  the north of the  block,  Seighford
Aerodrome was developed during the war.
The war had a dramatic effect on  local
life. The normally peaceful rural  area
was disrupted by noise from planes  and
the  occasional crash or other  mishap.
Seighford   Aerodrome  changed  from  a
training   ground  to  an   operational
airfield  with Halifax  and  Wellington
bombers   leaving  on   their   nightly
missions.                              
Italian  and  German Prisoners  of  War
worked  on local farms. A  number  were
billeted with local farmers and  became
trusted  and respected members  of  the
community. Many married local girls and
their  families still live in the area.
