		<title>13 STRATFORD MOP FAIR CONT'D</title>
		<content>RIDES COST FROM 50p UPWARDS AND FOOD-  
STALLS SELLING CANDY FLOSS,HOT DOGS ETC
ARE ALSO EXPENSIVE.THE MUSIC,LIGHTS AND
SCREAMING CONTRIBUTE TO THE EXCITEMENT 
WHICH ATTRACTS PEOPLE TO THE RIDES:    
THERE ARE SLOW RIDES FOR YOUNGSTERS EG.
ROUNDABOUTS AND FASTER,MORE DANGEROUS  
ONES FOR TEENAGERS EG."THE ZIPPER" AND 
THE "TIPTOP".                          
 IT COVERS THE WHOLE OF THE TOWN-CENTRE
WHICH LEADS TO VARIOUS PROBLEMS.TRAFFIC
CONGESTION ARISES BECAUSE ROADS ARE    
SHUT OFF SO DIVERSIONS ARE NEEDED.     
PUBLIC TRANSPORT IS ALSO DISRUPTED SO  
MOST LOCAL SCHOOLS ARE CLOSED FOR THE  
DAY.OTHER PROBLEMS SUCH AS LITTER AFTER
THE MOP HAS GONE CAUSE OFFENCE TO LOCAL
INHABITANTS.THE CRIME-RATE RISES WITH  
PETTY CRIMES EG.VANDALISM AND STEALING.
OBVIOUSLY THERE IS A RISK OF INJURY    
FROM THE RIDES BUT THIS DOES NOT REDUCE
THE GENERAL EXCITEMENT ON MOP DAY.     </content>
