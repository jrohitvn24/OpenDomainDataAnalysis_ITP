		<title>19THE POLICE FORCE.</title>
		<content> During the 1985 summer term we have   
 had the police in our school for a    
 fortnight telling us about their work.
 They began by telling us about the    
 ordinary constable what he wears and  
 what he does.They also told us about  
 police woman and one came into see us.
 We were told that to join the police  
 in our area.If you were a man you had 
 to be 5ft,8 inches tall, well built,  
 and not to have a criminal record.We  
 saw all different types of police work
 like,the drivers,the dog section and  
 their dogs,a police horse,a patrol car
 and a motor cycle from the traffic    
 division.On one afternoon they showed 
 us a film warning us never to go with 
 strangers.Another thing they did was  
 to bring in a Cleveland Transit bus   
 which our school adopted and it had   
 our name on it.
