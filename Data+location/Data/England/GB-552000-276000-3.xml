		<content> The low lying areas are the result of 
 an extensive drainage scheme that took
 place in the mid seventeenth century  
 under the guidance of a Dutchmen,     
 Cornelius Vermuyden. Much of the area 
 had been excavated during the last ice
 age and was below sea level, once the 
 ice age had finished the area flooded 
 and was known as the{Fens}.The main   
 aim of his scheme was to straighten   
 the river courses and take the water  
 off the land. Once this had been      
 achieved the peaty nature of the soils
 meant that they shrank and so the     
 general level of the land was lowered.
 Another problem resulting from this   
 drainage scheme was that the soils    
 were now more liable to soil erosion  
 from the wind. The area that used to  
 be flooded/marshy is now the very     
 level area found either side of the   
 River Ouse.                           </content>
