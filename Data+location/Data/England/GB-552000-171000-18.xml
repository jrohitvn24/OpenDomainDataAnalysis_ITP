		<content>  The Common, a triangle of land       
surrounded by trees, provides a setting
for many village functions including   
the Mayfair organised by a local school
The original aim of this being to      
bring the schools and the village      
together as a community.               
 Remarks from people interviewed:-     
A poor place to live, no changes,      
more shops, facilities and amenities   
needed, plenty of places easy to get to
  At the Post Office, Barn End Lane,   
people were interviewed regarding the  
traffic. Was it busy? Which day was    
busiest? How could pedestrians be      
helped in the area?  During one hour on
a weekday the following conclusions    
were made:- The traffic was moderate;  
Constant flow of cars,occasional vans  
and lorries, one bus. The one sensible 
sugestion made was for a pedestrian    
crossing at some point.                </content>
