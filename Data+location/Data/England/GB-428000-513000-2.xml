       Our school belongs to the parish
 of{St John and St Herbert, Darlington.
 The curate comes in to see us once a  
 week.  He has a weekly meeting with   
 the vicar to discuss the week ahead.  
 He takes services at 10 am on Sundays 
 and Wednesdays.  He says Sunday is a  
 good day because he knows what he is  
 doing.                                
       The curate takes 3 or 4 funerals
 a week.  He will visit a sick person  
 in hospital if he knows them but      
 sometimes he telephones the hospital  
 chaplain and asks him to make a visit.
       When a parishioner is very ill  
 the curate puts some communion bread  
 in a special box, takes it to the     
 house, and holds a little service.    
 The curates hobby is conjuring and he 
 is a member of the{Magic Circle.
