 High on a hill leading from the heart 
 of the village stands the church of   
 All Saints. The legend tells us that  
 in Edward the Confessor's time, they  
 began to build a church on a level    
 site to the south of the village, on  
 the water meadows of Sheepwash_ now   
 Sheepwash Lane. Each day the builders 
 worked;each night the stones were     
 removed to the top of the hill. Twice 
 the builders restarted the following  
 morning on the site they themselves   
 had chosen, but after the third time, 
 they recognised that the miraculous   
 removal of the stones was a clear     
 indication that God intended His      
 Church to be built on the hill_top.   
 Hence the name Godshill_ the hill God 
 chose for His Church.
