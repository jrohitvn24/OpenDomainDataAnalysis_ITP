		<content> On occasions tenants forget their     
 weekly payment but in general council 
 tenants do pay their rent when        
 due.Properties are vandalised but this
 varies from area to area.The waiting  
 list in Warmsworth for homes for      
 senior citizens is 6 yrs while        
 families would have to wait 2 yrs.The 
 hours of work vary to different       
 employees while some officers work a  
 few hours a week in their own         
 time.There has been no slum clearance 
 for several years and so not many     
 houses have been knocked down.        
   The council do not instal cavity    
 wall insulation and the majority of   
 tenants use solid fuel.Overall there  
 is a wide range of accommodation to   
 suit the variety of different         
 households in Warmsworth.
