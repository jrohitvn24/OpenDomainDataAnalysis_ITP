		<content>  Lower Langage Farm is well enclosed  
 and it is next door to Higher Langage 
 Farm.                                 
  Farming is a full time job, and the  
 farmer said he would never retire,and 
 he now works on his own.Unluckily the 
 family will not carry on the farm.    
  He was a{dairy farmer}but ten years  
 ago he changed to{beef.}This doesn't  
 give as much money but the hours are  
 easier! Last year due to the drought  
 his cattle didn't have enough feed.He 
 also lost seven cows due to           
{Salmonella.                           
  He uses British built machinery      
 mainly,but he finds no need for       
{computers.                            
  Although the{Industrial Estate}is    
 being built nearby,he will not lose   
 any land and he is not affected so    
 far.                                  
                                       </content>
