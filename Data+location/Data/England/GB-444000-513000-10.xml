		<content>{TRIMDON AVENUE}is the main road of a  
 large private estate.It is the only   
 road wide enough for local buses and  
 delivery lorries to the community     
 shops.The majority of residents use   
 cars for commuting to town (some 3    
 miles distant) whilst the health      
 conscious use pedal cycles.           
{POST HOUSE MOTEL}is situated on the   
 A1044 and serves travellers using the 
 main N/S A19 road.Traffic using this  
 road includes cars,lorries,commercial 
 vans and motorcycles.                 
{STAINTON/THORNTON}are two small       
 villages connected by a minor road.   
 This is a rural area,therefore traffic
 is normally light consisting of farm  
 tractors,livestock transporters,the   
 occasional car and a very infrequent  
 bus service.Village residents use     
 private cars as the main mode of      
 transport.                            </content>
