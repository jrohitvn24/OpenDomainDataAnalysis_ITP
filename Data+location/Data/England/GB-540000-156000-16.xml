Landscape in our area.                 
Biggin Hill is approximately 20 miles  
from London and one hour from the      
coast. The major shopping centres are  
Bromley and Croydon. Biggin Hill is    
situated by a valley with steep sides. 
Most of the residential part is built  
on the steep sides and the bottom of   
the valley. There are farms in the     
surrounding area, where it is easier to
farm the land. There are lots of farms 
in our neighbourhood. The farms don't  
grow many crops other than grass, there
are quite a lot of farm animals. Most  
people live within 5 minutes walk from 
farmland. A large number of houses have
a field at the end of their gardens.
