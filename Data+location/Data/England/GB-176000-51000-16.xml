		<content> Most sunny days I go swimming in our  
 pool.I enjoy swimming and diving and  
 using the water to cool off.Each week 
 we go out and hoover the pool to      
 ensure that it is clean.We also have  
 two caravans that we let in the summer
 so that the people can use the pool   
 aswell.                               
  On a Thursday night I go to Newquay  
 to the youth centre.People from       
 Goonhavern,Newquay and St Column Major
 go aswell.                            
  We do Flora Dances at school and have
 to wear red dresses if you are a girl 
 and white shorts and shirts if you are
 a boy.We also do Cornish and Folk     
 dancing.                              
  We also do athletics which includes  
 long jump,high jump,two hundred metres
 and other races.
