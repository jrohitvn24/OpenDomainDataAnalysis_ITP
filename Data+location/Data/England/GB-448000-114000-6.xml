		<title>06NATURE ALONG THE RAILWAY</title>
		<content> In 1839 the railway between Gosport   
 and Eastleigh was built.It opened in  
 1842 after a protest from villagers   
 about spoiling cultivated land.Fields 
 near the railway are cultivated so the
 cutting is one area where wild life   
 can flourish.At the beginning of the  
 footpath a stile had to be climbed.A  
 number of rotting branches cluttered  
 the pathway.The light was dim under   
 the shadows of the trees,ivy was      
 climbing the trunks of the trees.There
 were patches of red sweet grasses all 
 around.Mounds of earth arose either   
 side of the path,clumps of stinging   
 nettles added an extra wall to the    
 railway fence.Two trains thundered    
 along the track.We saw a badgers hole 
 in a steep slope.Toadstools were      
 growing in places.We spotted a        
 woodpecker in flight.We also saw a    
 Blue-tit and many acorns on the path. </content>
