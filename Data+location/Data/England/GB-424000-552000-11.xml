		<content>  A survey was carried out by the 4th  
 year children at{OUSTON JUNIOR SCHOOL}
 in the village of OUSTON in order to  
 discover what{JOBS PEOPLE LIVING IN   
{OUSTON}did and how in fact they{      
{TRAVELLED}to reach their place of     
 work.                                 
                                       
                                       
  The results that were obtained gave  
 rise to the view that people lived in 
 OUSTON not only because it is a       
 pleasant and modern area in which to  
 live but also because of its close    
 proximity to places of work.          
                                       
 It also gave some indication of the   
 higher social group generally living  
 in OUSTON.
