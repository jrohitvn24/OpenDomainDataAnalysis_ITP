		<content>   Quite a few of our mums and dads    
 work on a farm nearby. Some of them   
 work in and might own a shop or pub.  
 Some have their own businesses like   
 being a carpenter. Most mums do not   
 work because they have little children
 or there are no jobs they could do    
 close enough. Quite a lot of dads and 
 mums that can work have to go to      
 another place to work like Salisbury  
 or Shaftesbury or Mere. A few have    
 office jobs.                          
   Quite a few people have animals     
 which they raise to eat and the women 
 look after these and the men when they
 come home from work. Most mums and    
 dads who can work go to work.         
   Quite a few people do not work in   
 this area because they are too old and
 have retired.
