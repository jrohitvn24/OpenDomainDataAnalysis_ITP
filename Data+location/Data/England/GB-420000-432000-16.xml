		<title>16FULNECK MORAVIAN SETTLEMENT</title>
		<content>    On the southern outskirts of Pudsey
 on one of the most beautiful sites for
 many miles there is a little village  
 about half a mile long called         
 Fulneck.It was founded in the middle  
 of the 18th century by preachers from 
 Moravia (now part of Czechoslovakia). 
 The name of Fulneck is known          
 throughout the world because of the   
 Moravians' missionary work.In this    
 country it is well-known because of   
 the two private schools in the        
 village.Between them they have 800    
 pupils,some of whom are boarders.     
    Other places of interest in the    
 village are a museum,a pottery,a shop,
 a tea-room and,of course,the main     
 building is the church.Activities in  
 the village include a dramatic        
 society, Boys' Brigade,youth club and 
 Ladies' Circle.
