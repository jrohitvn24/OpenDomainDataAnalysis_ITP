		<title>10HISTORICAL BUILDINGS, ANLABY</title>
		<content> There are three buildings of          
 particular historical interest in     
 Anlaby. Each of the houses was        
 orginally a private residence but     
 today, only the {OLD HALL}remains so. 
 The Hall is set in a quarter-acre of  
 gardens and is valued at Â£100,000.    
 There are 8 upstairs rooms and 10     
 downstairs. The other two buildings of
 interest are {ANLABY HOUSE} and {     
{TRANBY CROFT.}Anlaby House is now the 
 home of Beverley Council's finance    
 department. From here the rates and   
 salaries are administered. In the     
 grounds, but not within the house     
 itself, are situated the offices of   
 the Water Authority and other         
 departments. Tranby Croft today is a  
 fee-paying school belonging to the    
 Church Schools Company Ltd. Known as  
 the Hull High School for Girls, it has
 500 pupils between 4 and 18 years old.</content>
