		<title>15THE POSTMISTRESS'S STORY</title>
		<content>   I get up between half past six and  
 seven. I sort out the daily newspapers
 for my son to deliver around the      
 village. Before the shop opens I go to
 Garforth and Castleford to buy the    
 bread and greens for sale in the shop.
   The shop opens at 9.00am. I keep the
 fridge clean. The shop is busy, so I  
 have a sandwich at 1.00pm when I close
 for a rest. I close the shop at 5.30pm
 when I clean it.                      
   I like most food, except fish       
 fingers. I prefer tea to coffee. I    
 enjoy a pint of lager at "The         
 Greyhound"! In my spare time I do a   
 lot in the village. I am a member of  
 the Parish Council, and a School      
 Govenor. I like reading in bed. I go  
 for walks with the dog. I like        
 driving.
