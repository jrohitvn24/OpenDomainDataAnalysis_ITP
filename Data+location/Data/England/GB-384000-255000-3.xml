		<title>03CARING FOR THE COMMUNITY.</title>
		<content>    Our area{Warndon }consists of large
 housing estates.The appearance of     
 parts of these{estates }is in places  
 quite disgusting.Some of the houses   
 are not kept in good shape,people do  
 not care.The lawns have{litter}on them
 and walls are covered with{graffiti.} 
 In our community we do not have much  
 noise except for a few streets near   
 the local youth centre.A lot of the   
{community respect}their streets and   
 try to keep them tidy.Some people dont
 care about our pavements.They let     
 their dogs go to toilet on pavements  
 instead of making them use the        
 gutter.Our{community}could change if  
 people tried to stop throwing down    
{litter}and  stopped writing{graffiti  
 over the public walls.If people did   
 take more care,Warndon and Worcester  
 would be a more attractive place to   
 live.                                 </content>
