 for my breakfast,I have Rice Crispies.

 we get to school Mr.Bishop does the   
 register.Then we go to assembly.After 
 assembly we do maths then its         
 playtime.After playtime we go to our  
 school library to choose new books    
 then its dinnertime.After dinner we   
 have a games lesson,we play netball in
 the winter and do athletics and play  
 rounders in the summer after games    
 we have playtime.Our last lesson of   
 the day is drama with Miss.Parr then  
 its time to go home.When I get home I 
 have a packet of crisps and then I go 
 and play with my friend Katie Deans. I
 usually watch television in the       
 evening and at half past nine I have a
 wash, brush my teeth and I go to bed.
