		<title>17THE WEY AND ARUN CANAL</title>
		<content> The River Arun was made navigable     
 between 1545 and 1575. This enabled   
 boats to reach Pallingham Quay which  
 is near Pulborough. The Wey Navigation
 was opened near Guildford in 1673 and 
 was extended to Godalming in 1763.    
 There were proposals to link the two  
 which dated back to 1641. They were   
 opened in 1816.                       
     The canal trust was formed in 1970
 to preserve and restore the canal.    
 Its objective is to restore the link  
 between the Wey and the Arun. When    
 this is done the water link between   
 the south of England and London will  
 be recreated.
