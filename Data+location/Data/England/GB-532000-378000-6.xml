		<content>      As there is only one sub-post    
 office which does not stock groceries 
 in the area, most of the local people 
 shop in Louth, the market town about 5
 miles away.  Most people go by car    
 although some rely on the bus service 
 on Wednesday and Saturday.  There is a
 very good variety of small shops and a
 market on several days of the week.   
 There are one or two of the national  
 chain stores but no supermarket of any
 size. A cattle market takes place     
 regularly.                            
      For major shopping expeditions or
 for bulk-buying by those involved in  
 trade, people travel to Grimsby,      
 Skegness or even as far as Hull,      
 Nottingham or Peterborough.
