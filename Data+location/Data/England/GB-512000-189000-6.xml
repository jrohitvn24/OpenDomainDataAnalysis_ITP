		<title>06A COUNCIL HOUSE, HARROW.</title>
		<content>    The average age of a council house 
 is about 35 years old.                
    The{entrance hall}usually gives    
 access to all ground floor rooms.     
    The main room is the{living room}  
 where you could relax, watch T.V. and 
 where you could also eat.             
    In the{kitchen,}we cook meals, wash
 clothes, plates cups, etc. If the     
 kitchen diner is big enough, you could
 eat there.                            
    Most council houses have three     
{bedrooms}where you sleep and rest and 
 also store clothes and toys.          
    In the{bathroom,}we wash ourselves 
 and take a bath.                      
    There is an{attic}which can be     
 called a loft. This is where you can  
 put things that are not in regular    
 use.                                  
    There might be a{cellar}where some 
 people put wine.                      </content>
