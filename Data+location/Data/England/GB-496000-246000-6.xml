		<content> Wheat is produced for animal feed and 
 human consumption.Barley is grown for 
 cattle and pig feed and used for low  
 grade malt.Both are sown in Autumn    
 using minimum cultivation methods-that
 is the land is 'scratched' at the     
 surface or scuffled and then sown     
 by conventional drills,with the       
 exception of the outgoing Rape crop   
 after which the land is ploughed.Hence
 each area is ploughed every 5         
 years.Wheat is drilled as long as     
 weather permits,then the remaining    
 land is given over to Spring          
 Barley.Three different varieties of   
 Wheat are used in consecutive years to
 avoid disease for which fungicide is  
 used.Some crops are aerial sprayed    
 when tractor spraying would damage the
 Wheat.Herbicides are used to control  
 wild oats and black grass.
