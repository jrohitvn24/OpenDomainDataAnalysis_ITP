		<title>08Changes at Holwell J.M.I.</title>
		<content> Mrs Worland has been a school cook at 
 our school for 26 years.She was able  
 to tell us about some of the changes  
 that have happened.We used to have an 
 old canteen which was on the other    
 side of the school field.The children 
 used to have to walk upto it in all   
 kinds of weather.It was a very big    
 building with lots of windows.Part of 
 it was unsafe and had to be knocked   
 down.Part of it was kept to be used as
 a garage for the school minibus.A new 
 canteen was built on to the school.   
 There used to be outside toilets which
 got frozen during winter.These were   
 knocked down and replaced with indoor 
 toilets.The infant classes were too   
 small,three of them were knocked into 
 two.Because of this we don't have     
 a class four.We think that the changes
 to our school have made it a much     
 better place.                         </content>
