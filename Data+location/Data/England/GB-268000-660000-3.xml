		<content>       In our area there are several   
things for children to join in.        
There are the Brownies and  Guides     
for girls, Scouts and Cubs for         
boys for example. In local school      
halls you can go to a disco on Fridays 
or a youth club on Mondays.            
       Viewpark's pubs and clubs are   
very popular with the adults and are   
all found along the main road. Some are
'The Stag','Royal Oak' and the         
'Ashley'. Although Uddingston is bigger
than Viewpark it has about the same    
number of pubs; some are the ''Anvil', 
'Angels' and the 'Bay Horse'.          
       Quite a lot of men keep racing  
pigeons  usually in a hut or 'loft'    
in the back garden. Greyhounds are also
popular and are used for racing too.   
You can often see men walking them     
for exercise along roads and parks.
