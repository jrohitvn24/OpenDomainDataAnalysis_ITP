		<content> On Wednesdays I go Brownies, run by   
 Brown Owl.  Our uniform is a brown    
 dress, belt and bobble hat and a      
 yellow tie on which we wear our       
 promise badge.  We earn interest      
 badges such as animal lover, hostess  
 and pony-rider. We play games.  Shadow
 is where everyone runs round and tries
 to keep on someone else's shadow.     
 When Brown Owl shouts stop, if you are
 standing on someone's shadow you get a
 spill - a small piece of coloured     
 wood.                                 
 Cub scouting is on a Monday night.  It
 is for boys aged 8 to ll years.  We do
 a lot of good things like playing     
 rounders.  We have to turn to the flag
 when the flag is being raised.  The   
 colour of the uniform is green.  We   
 have a cap, scarf, and proficiency    
 badges.                               
                                       </content>
