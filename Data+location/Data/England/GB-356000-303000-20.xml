		<title>20Current Concerns.</title>
		<content>    The main talking point in the      
 summer of 1985 was the appallingly{wet
{weather,}which had spoiled holidays   
 and many open-air events.  The        
 prospect, or reality of{unemployment  
 is a great cause of anxiety, and many 
 wonder whether the situation will ever
 improve. {Parents are very worried    
 that their children might finish full 
 time eduation and not find a job. Thus
 there is pressure on schools to       
 "deliver the goods" in terms of       
{academic results. }The threat of      
{nuclear war}is still a real cause of  
 alarm, felt most acutely by younger   
 folk.  Many people express concern    
 about the{falling moral standards}in  
 British society:  the increase in     
{violence,}the growth in the{divorce   
 rate, the{drug addiction}problem.     
 Very few have any answers.            
                                       </content>
