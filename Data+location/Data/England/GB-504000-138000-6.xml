		<title>06CRANLEIGH PARISH CHURCH</title>
		<content>  A church has been on this site since 
 late Norman times. The tower possibly 
 dates from about 1170, the nave is    
 Norman with many later additions. The 
 first known priest is Robert de Cumbe,
 1283. Since the destruction of most of
 the stained glass in 1944 by a bomb   
 the inside is full of light.          
  A 12th century carving is said to    
 have inspired the Cheshire cat in     
 'Alice in Wonderland'. A tomb in the  
 churchyard was reputedly used by      
 smugglers to hide brandy barrels.     
  Four or five services are held every 
 Sunday and the family can attend      
 clubs, Sunday School or Pram Service. 
   {Other places of worship}           
  Cranleigh also has Methodist, Baptist
 and Evangelical Free Chapels and a    
 branch of Christian Fellowship. There 
 is a large, modern Roman Catholic     
 church.                               </content>
