		<title>07POULTRY FARMING</title>
		<content>    Poultry farming is a very big and  
 important industry,because we eat a   
 lot of eggs and chicken.              
    There are several types of poultry 
 farming,for example:egg               
 production,chicken meat production,   
 turkey production,duck production,    
 quail production and other less common
 forms.                                
    Chickens lay eggs to be eaten or to
 be incubated in hatcheries.The chicks 
 from hatcheries are reared to produce 
 more eggs or chicken meat to be eaten.
    These baby chicks are taken to     
 farms in specially heated vans and    
 placed in clean,warm,dry and light    
 cabins with plenty of food and water. 
 Some are reared on the floor with     
 shavings for bedding,others are reared
 in cages for egg production.They stay 
 in the cabins for seven weeks then are
 taken by wagon to places to be killed.</content>
