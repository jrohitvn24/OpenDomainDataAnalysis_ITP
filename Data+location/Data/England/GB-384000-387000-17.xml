		<content>   IN OUR SURVEY OVER 60%BOUGHT BRITISH
 CARS AND ONLY 14% PURCHASED CARS MADE 
 OUTSIDE EUROPE-MAINLY JAPANESE.ONLY   
 THREE FAMILIES WERE WITHOUT A CAR     
 WHICH SUGGESTS THAT THE AREA IS A     
 FAIRLY PROSPEROUS ONE. THE FACT THAT  
 49% HAVE TWO OR MORE CARS WOULD SEEM  
 TO CONFIRM THIS.                      
   47%HAVE ONE VEHICLE ONLY YET ONE    
 FAMILY HAD FIVE CARS. WE THOUGHT THIS 
 COULD BE EXPLAINED BY THERE BEING     
 UNMARRIED CHILDREN OVER SEVENTEEN     
 LIVING AT HOME.
