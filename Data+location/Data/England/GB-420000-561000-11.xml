		<title>11DUNSTON-GOOD PLACE TO LIVE?</title>
		<content>  A lot of the people we interviewed   
 like living in Dunston because it is  
{friendly}and they have many friends.  
 they were born here and it has handy  
 amentiies. There are lots of shops and
 you don't have to travel,but if you   
 want to go to Newcastle it is not far 
 and there is good transport.The       
{railway line}has just reopened and you
 can now get a train to Newcastle.     
  Some of the older people were asked  
 "If they would like to move?",they    
 said "No,because it is harder to make 
 friends when you're older and it would
 be like a new world to them". Many    
 young people said "They would move    
 because there are{no jobs in Dunston."
  A lot of people don't like all of the
 graffiti. One person thought it wasn't
 safe for old people to go out at      
 night."Nobody was frightened in the   
 old days."                            </content>
