		<content> figure is a reduced output from the   
 3300 gallons they could produce before
 the E.E.C. rulings.  Much of the land 
 south of the main A12 is farmland too 
 and it is owned by farms such as      
 Mowden Hall Farm and Priory Farm.     
 These farms mainly grow cereal crops  
 like barley and wheat of which there  
 are many different types and also rape
 and others.  The area we live in is   
 very good for arable farming because  
 the land is flat and the earth is     
 quite heavy, beneath the top layers of
 soil there is clay and gravel.
