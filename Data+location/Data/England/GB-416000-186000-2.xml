		<content>{South Marston}lies near the A4311 road
 three miles from Swindon and the      
 Oxfordshire border. It is a small     
 village in open countryside which is  
 mainly pasture and arable land. The   
 land is mostly flat and the village   
 lies in a broad valley near the       
 Marlborough Downs. Livestock reared   
 are cattle, pigs and horses. There was
 a manor but it was demolished in 1984 
 for a new housing estate called The   
 Grove. There is a Norman church and a 
 Victorian chapel which is now         
 derelict. We have a Country Club and a
 Hotel with amenities. There is also a 
 playing field for children and a pub  
 called the Carriers Arms for adults.  
 There is a primary school for children
 aged 4 to 11 years and there are 52   
 children in the school and three      
 teachers now.
