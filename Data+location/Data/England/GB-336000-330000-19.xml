		<title>19Tourism and the canal</title>
		<content>  The Ellesmere  Canal  has  influenced
 the development of our landscape, but,
 surprisingly, it is still  influencing
 the area. The LMS closed all the local
 canals in 1944 although the Shrewsbury
 line had  been derelict for some time.
 The last operators, Peates of Maesbury
 Mill had changed to lorries and it was
 only in 1954 that the Llangollen Canal
 was  adopted  as a water feeder. Early
 cruising  enthusiasts such as Tom Rolt
 publicised  the canals and traffic has
 grown to  make  this  one  of the most
 popular canals  in  Britain. This  may
 have  led to  the  growth  of  holiday
 homes  and  to  an  influx of retiring
 couples. The effects  of  this  can be
 seen at Lower  Frankton  where  locals
 have found house  too pricey at recent
 auctions. People are  worried that, on
 retirement, they may have to leave the
 village they have always lived in.    </content>
