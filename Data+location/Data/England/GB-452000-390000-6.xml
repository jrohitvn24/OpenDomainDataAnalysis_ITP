		<title>06Maltby Colliery</title>
		<content> Maltby colliery is situated 3km east  
 of the town. It was sunk in 1908 to   
 mine the famous Barnsley seam. The pit
 has now been deepened to 900m to reach
 the Swallowood seam. Today 1600 miners
 produce 1 million tonnes p.a.,with    
 further expansion planned. A new shaft
 is being sunk to the deeper Haigh Moor
 and Lidgett seams, guaranteeing the   
 future of the colliery into the 21st  
 century. Outlets for coal include coke
 ovens,thermal power stations and      
 domestic use. Production was halted   
 during the miners' strike of 1984/5   
 but has now been resumed. The new     
 giant winding tower has joined the    
 spoil heap at the pit head,forming    
 twin land marks symbolising Maltby's  
 dependence on coal and the miners with
 their working mens clubs and galas    
 contribute a distinctive character to 
 the life of the neighbourhood.        </content>
