		<content> There are not any scheduled public    
 transport services for the area,      
 although buses connecting nearby towns
 pass through on the A46. The          
 population thus relies heavily on     
 cars, bicycles and taxis to get about.
 The children attending schools in     
 Market Rasen and Holton-le-Moor are   
 collected by a school bus each morning
 and brought home at night.            
 The nearest British Rail station is at
 Market Rasen and it is possible to    
 catch a direct train from here to and 
 from London once a day, also regular  
 services to other parts of the        
 country. Because of the transport     
 problems most people do try to help   
 neighbours, particularly during the   
 bad weather, and a good community     
 spirit prevails as a result.
