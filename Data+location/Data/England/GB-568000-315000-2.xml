		<content> East Winch is part of a combined pair 
 of parishes with Middleton, a few     
 miles to the west. Both parishes have 
 their own churches and services are   
 held regularly in both.               
 A new vicar has been appointed to the 
 two parishes recently after a period  
 of about nine months without a        
 minister. The previous minister left  
 the parishes to go to another part of 
 Norfolk in November 1984.             
 The church at East Winch stands on a  
 small mound just beside the main road 
 running through the village. A service
 is held there every Sunday            
 Behind the organ in the church there  
 are two tablets. Written on these is  
 the story of a man who was faithful to
 the king during the English   Civil   
 War.
