		<content> The natural beauty of the two lakes,  
 once gravel pits,now provide a haven  
 for plants,animals and birds.Reeds and
 rushes are good nesting sites,and the 
 fields have rabbits,insects and other 
 wildlife.Swifts fly round and we saw  
 a robin on a bush.We also saw pigeons,
 great tits,red admirals, small green  
 beetles and a thrush with a spotted,  
 bright white tummy.Through binoculars 
 we saw a swan with a dirty neck and   
 orange and black beak.We also saw a   
 Spotted Grebe.There is one pair of    
 breeding swans on each lake.Coots     
 breed on the lakes as well as ducks.  
 It is a beautiful,peaceful spot,which 
 the villagers cherish.Fishing rights  
 belong to the Kelvedon Club and the   
 lakes are well stocked with carp,     
 perch,tench,pike,roach,rudd and bream.
