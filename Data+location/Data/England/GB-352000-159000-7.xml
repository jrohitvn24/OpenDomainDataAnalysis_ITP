		<content> Chew Stoke School was founded in the  
 17th Century. The pupils have a summer
 festival every year. They have one    
 theme for this festival and each class
 do different scenes from it. The      
 school building itself is very old,   
 but newer bits have been added on. The
 head-mistress of this school is at the
 moment Mrs Z.E.Wilson. There are about
 one hundred and twenty pupils at this 
 school. The school has an old bell on 
 the top of it, it does not work any   
 more though. At this school they also 
 have a Christmas play but it is not   
 outside like the summer one but inside
 in the hall.
