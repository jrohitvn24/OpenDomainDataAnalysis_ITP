		<content>   There are also other interesting    
 historical remains in the area.       
   Eccleswall Court,now a farm,stands  
 on the site of Eccleswall Castle.This 
 site has not been excavated but there 
 is a tower which might have been part 
 of the castle.Relics supporting this  
 theory have been found but not        
 recently.On the same site at          
 Eccleswall there are the remains of a 
 chapel which is at least 500 years    
 old.Still in existence is the pond    
 which the monks built so they could   
 keep a supply of trout,their Friday   
 dinner.                               
   Not far away Bury Hill Chapel is    
 steeped in history.During the Roman   
 occupation the busy smelting station  
 of Ariconium occupied the area of the 
 chapel and here long before Ross began
 to take shape the arts of civilisation
 were practised.                       </content>
