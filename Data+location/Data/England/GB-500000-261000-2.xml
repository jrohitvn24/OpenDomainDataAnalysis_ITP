		<title>02BLEND OF OLD AND NEW RISELEY</title>
		<content>      The core of the old village is   
 still the High Street, running        
 parallel with the brook.  New owners  
 of the old timbered houses and        
 cottages have made additions and      
 alterations, usually sympathetic with 
 what was built 300 years ago. The     
 brook supports much wild life,        
 including many not so wild ducks, who 
 regularly hold up the traffic while   
 they take their time crossing from one
 favourite source of food to the next. 
 The Church, no longer in the centre of
 the Parish as it was before the       
 seventeenth century, stands high on   
 the edge of the fields, and is once   
 more attracting larger congregations. 
 The Methodist Church too, in its 20th 
 century building, has numerous        
 activities.  (to be continued)
