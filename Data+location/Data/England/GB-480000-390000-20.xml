		<title>20The Old Hall</title>
		<content>   The most interesting building in    
 Gainsborough is the Old Hall.It stands
 near the centre of the town,and was   
 built in the fifteenth and sixteenth  
 centuries by the Burgh family.It was  
 purchased by William Hickman in 1597  
 and was occupied by his descendants   
 until Thonock Hall (since demolished) 
 was built in the eighteenth century.  
   The Old Hall is built mainly of     
 brick,timber and plaster,there being  
 little available local stone.Inside   
 there is an impressive great hall     
 which is still used for local         
 functions,and a fine mediaeval        
 kitchen,with the original large       
 fireplaces and ovens.Also of interest 
 is the primitive toilet.Henry the     
 Eighth was supposed to have met his   
 last wife,Catherine Parr at the Hall. 
 It is reputedly haunted by the "Grey  
 Lady".                                </content>
