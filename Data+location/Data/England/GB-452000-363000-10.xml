		<title>10RECREATION GROUNDS.</title>
		<content>   A class of lower infants made visits
 to 3 local Recreation  Grounds.       
{Warsop Road Ground-}This has a        
 perimeter fence of 221 paces long or  
 128m,with only 2 gates.Inside is a    
 slide,a roundabout,6 swings.There used
 to be a play fort but this was        
 vandalised.In about 1 hour we saw 8   
 adults, (2 with dogs,a couple with a  
 child and a mum with a child.)We also 
 saw two boys on bikes." Should they   
 have been at school?"                 
{Vale Road Ground-}This is next to the 
 Community Centre.It has a large area  
 for ball games, 50 paces long and 35  
 wide.There is only 1 bench and flower 
 bed.Most of the area is for children. 
 With swings,a rocket,space shuttle,   
 climbing frame,slide and roundabout.  
 There is an old tennis court,and      
 toilets.{The Lord's Ground}is just a  
 field with nothing on it.{Class 2 S.E.</content>
