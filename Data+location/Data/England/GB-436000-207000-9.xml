		<content> There is a great deal of animal life  
dependent on the River Windrush. Birds 
such as Mallards, Moorhens, Coots and  
Little Grebes abound. A few families of
swans live in our area, one pair have  
produced 9 or 10 cygnets over the last 
few years in spite of the worry of lead
poisoning due to shot left by anglers. 
 There are a few mink along the river  
and they are now hunted. An occasional 
fox is seen and these are also hunted. 
 Hedgehogs are plentiful, judging by   
the numbers that we see squashed on the
roads. Water rats live on the river    
banks and brown rats are here too. They
are a problem around the Grain Stores. 
 There are wild cats and a few badgers 
in the woods, also grey squirrels.     
 Occasionally a heron or a kingfisher  
is seen catching fish.                 
 Mice and moles are small problems but 
myxomatosis is killing off the rabbits.</content>
