		<content> The village is made up of{long        
{established families}of 3 or 4        
 generations and{newcomers}of less than
 25years.Some of the established       
 families tend to live in older        
 terraced property originally rented,  
 although many of these houses have    
 been bought by newly married couples  
 as the older generation dies.Others   
 are{farmers}whose houses are over     
 four generations old.                 
 Between 15 and 20 years ago there was 
 a{rapid housing expansion}in the      
 village and many new houses were      
 built.This attracted people fron urban
 areas who{commute}to their work.      
{Young people}from established         
 families, not attending university,   
 tend to marry and settle in the       
 village or one of the neighbouring    
 villages.
