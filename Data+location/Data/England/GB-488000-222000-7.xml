		<content>    Inside the church the altar is     
 surrounded by stained glass windows.  
 In front of it are two tombs. One is  
 for Robert Dormer, who was the Lord of
 the Manor and who died in 1552. In the
 Lady Chapel there is a cross which is 
 dedicated to George Draper, who was   
 the churchwarden for 15 years and who 
 died in 1891.                         
    In the grounds of the church is a  
 wooden gateway dedicated to Francis   
 Henry Tatham, who was the priest in   
 1890. On the other side of the gateway
 is some Latin writing, which means    
 "For God so loved the world", from St.
 John.
