		<content>  Nearly everyone in our area has a    
telephone. As there are many isolated  
farms and houses this is an essential  
means of communication. All the        
telephone numbers in our village have 3
digits. The local area code is 84 and  
the national code is 0946.             
  The Postal Service is an important   
means of communication.Post arrives at 
the Post Office, from Whitehaven, at   
a.m. The post is delivered by the Post 
Lady who has 231 places she could      
visit. She enjoys her job and goes     
round the area on her bicycle          
accompanied by the Golden Labrador dog 
owned by the Sub Postmistress.         
  There is a local dialect which is    
sometimes used in verbal communications
with words such as beck - stream, yam -
home, scrunt -apple core, dyke -hedge. 
Numbers used by farmers are 1-yan,     
2-tan, 3-tethera, 4-nethera, 5-pip.    </content>
