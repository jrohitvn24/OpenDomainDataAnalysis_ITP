		<title>17A NORMAL SCHOOL DAY IN B.H.</title>
		<content> I wake up in the morning &amp; open the   
 curtains, &amp; get dressed. I go down    
 stairs &amp; have my breakfast, which     
 is usually Frosties. I have to make a 
 packed lunch for my brother . I then  
 go out &amp; feed my 36 fish ,kept in a   
 pond, &amp; my two rabbits. I brush my    
 hair &amp; then I wait for for my friend  
 to come and knock for me. We then go  
 to another friends house, she spends a
 long time getting ready. That is why  
 we are usually late for school. We    
 usually arrive at school at9-15 a.m.  
 &amp; go into registration this finishes  
 at 9-30. We have Technical Drawing in 
 the morning, then a break at 10.40. At
 11.00  we go back to T.D. till 12.10. 
 I usually walk home to lunch with a   
 friend &amp; we come back at 1.15. We have
 registration till 1.25 then Biology   
 till 2.35. Next we have Geography till
 we go home at 3.50. to do my homework.</content>
