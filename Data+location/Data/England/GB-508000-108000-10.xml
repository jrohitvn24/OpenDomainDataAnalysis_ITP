 Findon Cricket Club was founded in    
 l867 but cricket was played in and    
 around Findon for more than l00 years 
 before that.  The ground is named     
 Kennel Bottom, from the kennels where 
 the foxhounds were lodged at the      
 north-east corner.  There are about 60
 playing members and 200 social        
 members. Ages range from 9 to 76      
 years. There is a charity match every 
 other year for Lavinia, Duchess of    
 Norfolk's charity.  In l985 the All   
 England Women's team played Findon and
 the result was a draw.                
 A network of bridle and footpaths over
 the Downs is popular with residents   
 and visitors alike.                   
 On Blackpatch Hill radio-controlled   
 powered model aircraft are flown.
