		<content>    In terms of medical care, most     
 people go to the Kimbolton Doctors'   
 Surgery, and to Huntingdon and        
 St.Neots for dental treatment.        
    To help those without transport of 
 their own, a well-used mobile library 
 visits us fortnightly and one of our  
 Parish Councillors volunteers to      
 collect medicines, weekly, from       
 Kimbolton.                            
    Most of us have come to depend on  
 car transport for shopping. Infrequent
 bus services are available, though, to
 Bedford, St.Neots and Peterborough.   
 According to our survey 17% do bulk   
 shopping in Cambridge or Bedford; 30% 
 in Huntingdon, and 53% in St.Neots.   
    Although most people thought that  
 long distances and poor public        
 transport make life more difficult,   
 they agreed that ready access to the  
 A1 makes car transport easier.        </content>
