		<title>063rd Clapham Brownie Pack</title>
		<content> We have our Brownie Pack in the school
 hall.   Julia, Faye and lots more     
 people do it.   There are two adults. 
 We call them Brown Owl and Tawny.     
 When we get to Brownies we play games.
 We have to wear a uniform with a hat  
 and a badge which is made of silver   
 metal.   We play games like "We went  
 to the old Kentucky, the old Kentucky 
 Fair".  I have got a badge about First
 Aid.   We had to have a model and blow
 into it to sew if we could do it.     
 The model was called an artificial    
 rescussitation Anne.   We had a test  
 to see if we could make cups of tea.  
 And we all had to get enrolled before 
 we could be Brownies.   We were first 
 called Tweens before we were Brownies.
 There is a time when you get          
 enrolled and then you are a Brownie   
 like me.
