		<title>18Grange Estate, Kettering.</title>
		<content>  Grange Estate was built in the mid-  
50's to cater for the enlarging        
population at that time.  The estate is
wholly of council houses but recently  
some have been purchased and are now   
attractive private dwellings. One area 
has large 4/5 bedroomed houses. There  
are 3 Christian churches: R.C.,        
Anglican, Methodist. All roads have a  
lady's name (Jean Road, Ruth Gardens). 
  It is a fact that this is now one of 
the poorer areas of Kettering with much
unemployment, 1 parent families, split 
homes and children in care.  This has  
been recognised by the Borough Council 
who have just produced Â£Four Wards     
Study Kettering 1985.'  The various    
indices of deprivation are examined as 
they exist here and in Avondale, St.   
Mary's and St.Andrew's Wards.          
Recommendations are made for future    
action to improve the situation.       </content>
