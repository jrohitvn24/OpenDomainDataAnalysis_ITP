		<title>08INDUSTRY IN LITTLE BADDOW</title>
		<content>   Although Little Baddow is primarily 
 an agricultural area there are a few  
 pockets of industry to be found in the
 outlying areas of the village. The    
 geological survey of the area shows   
 that the village is built on deposits 
 of sand and gravel, and there is a    
 sand pit near the village which       
 quarries sand for use in the          
 construction industry. The sand pit is
 a further example of the way in which 
 the natural resources of the land are 
 used to provide Little Baddow with its
 livelihood.                           
   A further type of industry in Little
 Baddow has arisen from the            
 concentration of agriculture in the   
 area. For example a Mushroom farm and 
 a Chicken farm have been set up. This 
 is a modern form of intensive farming 
 designed specifically to achieve mass 
 production in the food industry.      </content>
