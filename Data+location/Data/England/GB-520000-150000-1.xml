		<title>01North Downs at Buckland</title>
		<content> The block is sharply bounded on the   
 north by the North Downs escarpment,  
 rising to 600ft, scarred on the south 
 face by worked out lime excavations.  
 To the south the area is bounded by   
 part of Betchworth village including  
 the school; to the west by            
 agricultural land, both arable &amp; rough
 grazing, and some nursery gardens; &amp;  
 to the east by mixed farm land &amp;      
 sandpits. The area is crossed by one  
 north-south road, Pebble Hill (B2032);
 &amp; from east to west by (i) the North  
 Downs Long Distance footpath; (ii) the
 Southern Railway Tonbridge to Reading 
 line (hourly trains from Betchworth   
 Station in both directions on         
 weekdays) and (iii) the A25 (Wrotham, 
 Kent, to Guildford) road. The new M25 
 briefly cuts the NE corner of the     
 block.
