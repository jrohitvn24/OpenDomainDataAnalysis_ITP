		<title>09Smarden W - Channel Tunnel</title>
		<content> Although the storm at present raging  
 over the channel tunnel is causing    
 only ripples in Smarden, it is likely 
 to have an impact on the area, with a 
 large increase in traffic on country  
 lanes already overburdened. If any of 
 the plans at present proposed go      
 through, a large area of lovely       
 Kentish countryside will become a vast
 railway marshalling yard. Villages    
 around Ashford will be swallowed up in
 approach roads and urban sprawl, and  
 the whole character of the Weald of   
 Kent will be drastically changed. Some
 are for the project, many against; we 
 wonder what those who follow after    
 will find if the scheme goes through. 
 Will Kent still be the 'Garden of     
 England' or merely a 'Corridor to     
 Europe'?
