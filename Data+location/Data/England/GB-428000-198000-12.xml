 The farmer, a keen conservationist,   
has set up a farm trail around the new 
woodland areas that he has created. He 
started this project in 1951 and was   
made especially aware of the           
disappearance of farm trees after Dutch
Elm Disease and storm damage had       
affected his woods.                    
 By planting broad shelter belts of    
trees and bushes alongside some of the 
hedges, he is hoping to create suitable
habitats to encourage the right birds  
and insects to help his efforts to     
control pests naturally. Experiments   
during this last year, have shown that 
corn treated with chemical sprays was  
no better than an untreated crop, grown
in a field from which slugs were eaten 
by birds and aphids were removed by    
ladybirds from the nearby willows.
