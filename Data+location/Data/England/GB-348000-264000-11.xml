		<title>11SCHOOLBOY'S STORY (CONT.)</title>
		<content> We come back into school at 10.45 and 
 do English work until lunchtime at    
 12.00. The people who have hot meals  
 go in first, so while they are eating,
 the children who eat sandwiches have  
 some playtime. By 12.25 the dinner    
 children have gone outside to have    
 their playtime until 1.05p.m. when we 
 all come in. Some of us get our       
 swimming kit and go swimming in       
 Leominster while the rest of us have  
 activities. When the swimming people  
 come back at 2.45 our class teacher   
 reads us a story for 15 minutes. At   
 3.00 we pack up and go home. Some     
 people walk, some go on the bus but   
 most go by car like me.When I get home
 I watch television while I eat supper 
 till 6.00 Then I get in the car and go
 to Cubs. After Cubs I go to bed, ready
 for the next day.
