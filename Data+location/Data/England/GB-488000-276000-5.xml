 People come from miles around to      
visit the park with its many rides and 
entertainments and open                
spaces.Although some of the rides are  
expensive its well worth it.The most   
recent ride is the Two Lane Water      
Slide where you can slip down and have 
a nice dip in the pool at the          
end.Another popular ride is the double 
Pirate Ship which is a large swinging  
boat.In our survey of visitors ,these  
two rides proved to be the most        
popular.                               
                                       
                                       
Rides are not payed for individually.  
Tickets are bought in advance.
