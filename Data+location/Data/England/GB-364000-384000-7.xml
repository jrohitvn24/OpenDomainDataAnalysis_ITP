		<title>07SATURDAY FAMILY LIFE IN LYMM</title>
		<content> On a Saturday, life is mixed.  I lie  
 in bed until 9.OO am reading and      
 feeling hungry.  Shouting penetrates  
 my mind as babies play in the next    
 room.  My mother enters with a pot of 
 tea at last.  Now I jump out of bed   
 and dress hurriedly.  Breakfast awaits
 my empty stomach.  Cereal and toast   
 make a good meal.  After breakfast I  
 help my mother feed the babies and    
 play with them.  At lOam I do my      
 homework and then I watch television. 
 Lunch consists of vegetable soup.  I  
 go out after lunch to play with my    
 friends.  Sometimes I go to the fish  
 and chip shop for dinner, but most    
 Saturdays I have pizza, salad and     
 chips.  After tea I use my computer,  
 and play with the children.  I watch  
 television for most of the evening and
 I read until at last I go to bed.
