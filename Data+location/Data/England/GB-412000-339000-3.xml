		<title>03The Village</title>
		<content> Roston is a small village, many of its
 inhabitants work locally, however some
 people work in the nearby market town 
 of Ashbourne or city of Derby. The    
 village is just farms and cottages,   
 very little modern housing. The two   
 local pubs are some distance from the 
 village in opposite directions. The   
 Roston Inn( known by the locals as The
 Shant) and the Queen Adelaide Arms are
 well worth a visit. The football pitch
 is also a mile outside the village    
 along a country lane. The village     
 shool and village hall are also some  
 distance from the main housing centre.
 Despite being so spead community      
 spirit among the inhabitants of       
 Norbury/ Roston is very high and well 
 developed. It is a joy to live and    
 work in this beautiful part of        
 England.
