		<title>10School meals.</title>
		<content>  In 1985 a high percentage of all     
 school children partake of 'school    
 dinners' which is a cooked, two course
 meal costing 67 pence. We decided to  
 carry out a survey to find out if they
 enjoyed these meals and what would    
 they select as their favourite school 
 lunch, and their least preferred meal,
 if given a choice of what was usually 
 on offer. This was their verdict:     
{FAVOURITE          }LEAST LIKED       
{_________          }___________       
{FISH FINGERS,      }LIVER AND ONIONS, 
{CHIPS,             }SWEDE,            
{PEAS,              }SWEET CORN,       
{SYRUP SPONGE WITH  }SEMOLINA WITH     
{CUSTARD.           }JAM.              
                                       
  These results were obtained from a   
 sample of  35 children, which is      
 55% of those having a school dinner.  
 The overall vedict was 'EXCELLENT'!   </content>
