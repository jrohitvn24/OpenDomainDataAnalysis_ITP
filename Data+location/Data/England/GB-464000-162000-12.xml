		<content>{Home Poles. }You have to run from pole
 to pole and someone tries to catch    
 you. When you have been caught,you're 
 it. {Hot Chocolate.}You need four boys
 or girls and one person to stand      
 facing the wall. Then the people in   
 the line try to touch the person      
 facing the wall without him knowing.  
 When they touch him they shout "Hot   
 Chocolate". {Kingdoms.}We say "By     
 field of land I tell you go over      
 there". Then you point to a place in  
 the playground. The other person has  
 to run over to it and run back.       
 The infant children learn and perform 
 maypole dances. Traditional children's
 singing games are still played.       
 Special favourites are:- Dusty        
 Bluebells, Bingo, Round and round the 
 Village, I sent a message to my love, 
 Sally go round the Moon.
