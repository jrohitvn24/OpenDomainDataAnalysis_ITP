		<content>   The  youngest children spend some   
 of the  afternoon in the wooden Wendy 
 House playing keeping house, with     
 various toys and games, and in sand   
 and water play. They have regular P.E.
 in the hall which is equipped with    
 large  climbing apparatus.Some mothers
 come into school to help in the       
 library, and help the infants with    
 their cooking of gingerbread men,     
 tarts and biscuits. Parents also hear 
 children read and help to make        
 costumes and props for the Christmas  
 concerts.                             
   There are three lower junior        
 teachers with three classes of about  
 25 children.There is a team leader and
 the day is operated along team lines.
