		<content>    There are about 60 people,over 60, 
 in the Cheery Club, as well as 14     
 helpers. The Club started in 1951.    
    It helps elderly people to get out 
 in the afternoon once a fortnight as  
 the helpers provide transport. At the 
 meetings they play cards,chat, have   
 tea, and then a raffle. Once a year,  
 they go on an outing. About 20 members
 attend the meetings, out of a total of
 60.                                   
    They raise money by having Sales   
 and Coffee Evenings.                  
    Every Christmas, the schoolchildren
 entertain the Cheery Club at their    
 Christmas party.
