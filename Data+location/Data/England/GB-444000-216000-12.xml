		<title>12SCHOOLS IN WOODSTOCK</title>
		<content>  There are two schools in Woodstock, a
primary and a secondary school. The    
Marlborough School is a mixed ability  
11-18 school. It was built in 1939.    
There are 45 teachers at the school and
about 800 pupils including some        
handicapped children. The school has   
pioneered many new ideas. In the       
afternoons pupils choose activities    
from a list including gardening,       
beekeeping and sailing. The History    
Club and Class 1S collected and wrote  
the material in this survey.           
  The Primary School was built in 1854 
and a new building was built a quarter 
of a mile away in 1967. They decided to
clse down the Old School recently      
because will be much easier with       
everybody together. The extension to   
the New School will be finished by     
Christmas. There are 250 children in   
the school where there were once 450.  </content>
