		<title>14Motorway Comes To Codsall</title>
		<content>They stood sentry-like and silent apart
from the echoes of the wind and the    
distant calls of birds. The plant life 
had been left virtually undisturbed for
centuries and southern Marsh Orchids in
particular proliferated.Badgers, foxes,
stoats, weasels and squirrels abounded.
Then came the Motorway. I stayed at the
Temple for six months and saw scenes to
break the heart of any country loving  
person. Strong,tall trees, over a      
hundred years old, nudged to the ground
in as many minutes. The new road cut a 
long,curved swathe through the woods,  
slicing through the approach track and 
missing the rear of Temple Cottage by  
40 yards. Gone were the trees and all  
the wild life of any description,and in
their place an unbearable construction 
noise. Now the woods echo to the drone 
of traffic, the Grecian Temple Cottage 
is deserted and men call it progress.  </content>
