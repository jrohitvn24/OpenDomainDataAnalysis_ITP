		<content>{Porthcurno is part of the history of  
{telecommunications.}This quiet little 
 cove provided an excellent landing and
 the shortest sea route for the{       
{submarine telegraph cables }laid to   
 Lisbon and Gibraltar in 1870, and     
 later all over the world. During{World
{War 2}the station was transferred to a
 tunnel dug into the side of the       
 valley. When the telegraph station    
 closed in 1970, the buildings and     
 tunnels became entirely a training    
 college.{This now offers some of the  
{finest facilites in international     
{telecommunications,}with more than 40 
 classrooms and labs which will cater  
 for 150 students. Each student has to 
 pay Â£500-00 a week to go to the       
 college. This includes food and       
 accomodation.
