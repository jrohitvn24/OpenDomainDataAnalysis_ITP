		<title>16  CAMMEL LAIRDS SHIPYARD</title>
		<content> In{1857 Cammel Lairds Shipyard}moved  
 to its present site, south of         
 Woodside Ferry.  The shipyard has     
 always been a man source of{employment
 in this area.  One reason for high    
{unemployment}here has been the decline
 of the yards. The new Cammel lairds   
 opened in 1978. The{covered yard}is   
 one of the{biggest buildings}of its   
 kind.  The hall is 145m long  by 107m 
 wide and 50m in height.  The overhead 
 cranes can lift 260 tonnes.  The{ship 
{hall}can take two ships at a time.    
 The hall is split into two bays.  At  
 the western end of the hall is the    
 final assembly area. When a section is
 completed it is lifted onto an        
 elevated slipway. Completed ships then
 pass through giant doors which slide  
 back.
