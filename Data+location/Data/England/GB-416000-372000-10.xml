		<title>10PEOPLE CRESSBROOK WARDLOW</title>
		<content>{Cressbrook}has 106 males and 109      
 females.{Wardlow}has 49 males and 46  
 females.All ages are fairly equally   
 represented.Most people in these      
 communities live to old age.          
 Inhabitants of the area are mainly    
 working class.                        
 As many of the old mill cottages ,    
 especially the Ravensdale Cottages,are
 now privately owned; by families who  
 live outside the area,and use them for
 second homes;the population is        
 periodically increased at week-ends   
 and holidays.                         
 These communities are very closely    
 knit. Most young people do not move   
 away from home to work, but find work 
 locally.                              
 The Tideswell doctor holds a surgery  
 once a week in a private house in the 
 village.                              
                                       </content>
