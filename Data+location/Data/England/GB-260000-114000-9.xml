		<content> The land was given in{1856}by the Earl
 of Portsmouth, who owned nearly all   
 the village.The cost of building was  
 met by public subscription, a grant   
 from the Church of England and by     
 farmers who hauled the materials free 
 of charge.Some of the stone came from 
 the old church house.It was an all-age
 school for 130 scholars.The main room 
 was divided in two by a screen,and the
 Infants room was the present office.  
 We still have the teacher's{Victorian}
{desk.In 1985 there are 33 children in 
 school.The Infants are in an outside  
 classroom.The main building has been  
 extended to include a kitchen, but we 
 have dinners brought from Chulmleigh  
 School by car.We have our own swimming
 pool, and a big playing field.We can  
 use the Parish Hall when we need extra
 space for country dancing or drama.
