		<title>10The landscape in this survey</title>
		<content> The general landscape in this area is 
 one of flatness,the only hill being at
 Flawborough where the whole village is
 situated at the top of the hill giving
 a good view of the rest of the area.  
 Flawborough also is more of a         
 'prairie' type of landscape due to    
 hedge removal to give large areas of  
 arable farmland.The area containing   
 the gypsum works create an untidy     
 landscape with its factory for        
 processing on the one hand,reclaimed  
 fields with newly planted trees on the
 other.Where the works which has       
 recently ceased to operate are        
 abandonned buildings and excavation   
 sites which are scarring the          
 countryside until reclamation and     
 screening are carried out and the land
 returned to farming use.Diseased trees
 are gradually being replaced by       
 replanting schemes.                   </content>
