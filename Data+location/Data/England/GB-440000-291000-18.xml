  On the 15th of June 1985 Hinckley    
 held its{Annual Carnival.}Forty       
 decorated trucks and bands paraded    
 through the streets of Hinckley. This 
 annual event raised a record Â£1420 for
 charity and was watched by thousands  
 of people.                            
  The theme of floats was to celebrate 
 the carnival's silver jubilee and many
 floats depicted how life had changed  
 in the last twenty-five  years. One   
 showed twenty-five years of space     
 travel while another showed the       
 children's T.V.programmes over the    
 last quarter of a centuary.           
  The procession ended at Claredon     
 Fields where there was many stalls    
 with games, competitions and things   
 to buy. There was a great atmosphere.
