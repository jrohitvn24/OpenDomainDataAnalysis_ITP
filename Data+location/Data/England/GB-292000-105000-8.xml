		<title>08BICKLEIGH CHURCH</title>
		<content> The parish church of St. Mary the     
 Virgin is in the quiet centre of the  
 village. Parish registers begin in the
 year 1573, earlier ones having been   
 lost. The present church dates from   
 1268, the main shell of tower, chancel
 and nave being enlarged by a south    
 aisle in C15th. A Norman tub font,    
 capitals to the C15th arches, carved  
 bench ends and tombs of the local     
 Carew family are the most attractive  
 details of the interior. The church   
 was completely restored in 1848, and  
 bells, added to over the years, were  
 completed by a sixth in 1908.         
 Bickleigh is one of the Exe Valley    
 Group of 14 parishes.                 
 Regular Sunday services are held, and 
 the main festivals of the Christian   
 year are well attended.
