		<title>11QUESTIONAIRE - Introduction</title>
		<content> As part of our survey,we decided to   
 study the changing lifestyles of the  
 people in our area.Our intention was  
 to show this to the children via      
 statistics obtained using a           
 questionaire.The area we are dealing  
 with has seen a great change in recent
 years.In the 1950's this area was     
 famous for its cotton mills and       
 slipper works.The majority of people  
 working within walking distance of    
 their homes.Since the decline in the  
 cotton and related industries some of 
 the large factories have been         
 demolished,but others have remained,  
 being split into smaller units,and    
 used for new enterprises.             
 As we have such excellent motorway    
 links i.e.via the M66, we now see a   
 new trend,that of people moving into  
 the area and commuting to their place 
 of work.                              </content>
