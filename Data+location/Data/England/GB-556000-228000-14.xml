		<content> For 25 years there has been concern   
 about the development of Stansted     
 Airport. Residents fear the plan to   
 increase from \ to 15 million         
 passengers pa, the escalation of noise
 &amp; huge housing projects will severely 
 damage the quality of life. Many      
 appreciate that the airport will      
 provide more jobs. Some regret seeing 
 ex-homes of local workers belatedly   
 improved by commuters.There is concern
 over stubble burning causing dangerous
 smoke &amp; fog, damaging trees, hedges &amp; 
 buildings. Many farmers now use other 
 methods. The destruction of hedges    
 causes concern for habitats of many   
 birds &amp; small mammals &amp; the resultant 
 large expanses of field are liable to 
 soil erosion. The marked reduction in 
 livestock, notable dairy herds, to    
 suit Common Market requirements is    
 deplored.                             </content>
