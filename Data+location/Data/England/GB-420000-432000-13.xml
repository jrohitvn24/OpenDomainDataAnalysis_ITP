		<title>13POST HILL (Roman Hill)</title>
		<content>   This area lies on the east of the   
 block in the{Cockersdale}countryside  
 park.The park warden hopes that sewage
 polluting the local beck will soon be 
 diverted and that trout will return,  
 encouraging more than the now rare    
 kingfisher to visit the water.        
   The{Roman}connection comes from a   
 number of coins found nearby in 1910, 
 but no settlement has ever been found.
   The steep hill is the site of many  
 pursuits.Both official and unofficial 
 motorcycle trials are often held here 
 and children ride their{BMX}bikes and 
 swing from the trees.                 
   The area is owned privately by a    
 local firm of building contractors and
 planning consent has been sought for a
 dry ski-run and golf driving-range.   
 Hopefully such a major development    
 will not change the character of this 
 very beautiful and quiet country spot.</content>
