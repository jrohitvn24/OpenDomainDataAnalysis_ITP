		<title>01Gazeteer of Brafferton area</title>
		<content>{  Brafferton}is a small village lying 
 6 kilometres  north of{Darlington.}The
 area around the village is extremely  
 rural away from the main road and many
 of the farms are surprisingly         
 isolated.                             
   Almost all the activity in the area 
 is{farming}although a section of the  
 residents commute to work to nearby   
{Newton Aycliffe}or to Darlington.     
   The area divides East-West neatly   
 into half with the East containing the
 residential areas of Brafferton,      
{Coatham Mundeville}and the ribbon     
 housing development around{High       
{Beaumont Hill.}It also includes the   
 main communications in the area       
 running North-South i.e. the motorway,
 the A167  and the main line railway.  
   The Western half is composed of     
 scattered farms,tracks and numerous   
 becks flowing into the river Skerne.  </content>
