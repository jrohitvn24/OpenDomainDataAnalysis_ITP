		<title>12SAXON STREET METHODIST CH.</title>
		<content> There is a {Methodist Chapel}in Saxon 
 Street, which is quite big in         
 comparison to the size of other       
 methodist chapels in our area. The    
 chapel has a high ceiling and low     
 lights hung on chains. You can hear   
 someone whispering from the back. To  
 build the chapel, local people had to 
 raise money to buy the materials.     
 Saxon Street Chapel is more plain than
 St Mary's CofE Church in Cheveley,    
 which is decorated with stained glass 
 windows and has a piped organ. The    
 chapel has plainer coloured windows   
 and an electronic organ.              
 We talked to Mrs Jaggard, one of the  
 local preachers at the church. She is 
 also the Captain of the Girls' Brigade
 there. At chapel she sometimes plays  
 the organ. She said that Methodists   
 don't have bishops, which the CofE    
 have.                                 </content>
