		<title>18An old-age pensioner</title>
		<content> This old gentleman is now 102 years   
 old and has had many occupations in   
 his life.At first he was a dyer,but   
 then the First World War broke out and
 he went into Civil Defence.Later in   
 his life he worked for the City       
 Transport, driving a bus.Now he has   
 retired and is an old age pensioner.  
 He was born in Bentham in Lancashire  
 and then moved to Windhill.When he    
 married he moved to live with his wife
 in Thackley.                          
 He has lived here with his wife in a  
 small cottage for 15 years. He likes  
 living in Thackley as the shops are   
 not too far away and they are easy to 
 get to.When he was told about this    
 information being written up on       
 computer discs he was very startled.  
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
