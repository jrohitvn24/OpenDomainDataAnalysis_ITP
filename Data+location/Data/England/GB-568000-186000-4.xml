		<content> The town of Bsildon is divided up into
 many Neighbourhood Areas. Each of the 
 se areas has a Secondary School, a    
 Junior School and an Infants School.  
                                       
 Most of the children stay within the  
 neighbourhood for all there schooling,
 but some choose to go elsewhere.      
                                       
 Basildon was full of children once,   
 but now most of them have left school 
 and are at work. This means that many 
 less children are at school in the    
 town, and most schools have only half 
 the number of children they had 10    
 years ago. Many schools are closing,  
 and the Infant and Junior schools are 
 combining into one school. The old    
 buildings are being used for other    
 purposes.
