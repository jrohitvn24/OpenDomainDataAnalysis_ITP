		<content> Next we went to the Special Care Baby 
 Unit where babies which are very small
 and usually very ill are treated. We  
 saw three very tiny babies. One had   
 just had an operation on its heart at 
 another hospital, St.Mary's. The three
 babies could not be fed by bottle and 
 could only take food through a special
 tube. They were kept in cots called   
 incubators and they had several plugs 
 on them attached to machines which    
 monitored their progress. The babies  
 were so small they wore nappies which 
 were much smaller than those that can 
 be bought in the shops. Doctors and   
 nurses working in these wards had to  
 wear green gowns to prevent the       
 spreading of germs.                   
 Then we went to the laundry, a huge   
 place employing 51 people. Over       
 100,000 pieces of linen are washed and
 ironed each week. It was much too hot.</content>
