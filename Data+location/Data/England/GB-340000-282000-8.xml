		<title>08Sallow Coppice and Wart Hill</title>
		<content> As we came out of the isolated wood,  
 We saw Stokesay Castle nestled down   
                     in the valley.    
 Suddenly, a jet breaks the silence,   
 Birds stop singing for a while,       
 But soon all returns to normal in     
                   Sallow Coppice.     
                                       
 WART HILL                             
    I went to Wart Hill to look at the 
 countryside. First we walked through a
 forest. It felt peaceful although the 
 birds were singing.The floor was soft 
 and springy.It was thick with pine    
 needles.there were lots of evergreens 
 and deciduous trees,my favourite is   
 the evergreen because of its fresh    
 smell.As we walked we collected cones 
 until we reached the top.I sat on the 
 checkpoint and drew a tree.From Wart  
 Hill you can see all our block and the
 view is lovely.                       </content>
