		<title>11LIVING ON A FARM TODAY</title>
		<content> I live at Murrells End Farm which has 
 430 acres. We grow 90 acres of barley,
 180 acres of wheat, 20 acres of       
 potatoes, 40 acres of oil seed rape.  
 We graze 100 beef cattle to the weight
 of 650 kgs. on 100 acres of grass . We
 have 1 Claas Combine Harvester, 3     
 Massey Ferguson tractors, and a 1000  
 tonne grain store. We breed horses to 
 be sold as National Hunt Race Horses. 
 I own 2 ponies which I enjoy riding.  
 During the winter months I help feed  
 the cattle as they are wintered in the
 barn and help fork out the silage. In 
 the summer I help harvest the fields  
 baling the straw, but I especially    
 like riding on the combine. In the    
 Autumn I ride on the potato harvester,
 helping to grade the potatoes which   
 are sold to shops in the              
 neighbourhood.
