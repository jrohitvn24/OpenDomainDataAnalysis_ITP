		<title>01A DAY IN THE LIFE OF KATHI</title>
		<content> {June 13th.1985.}  Morning.           
I got up at 7.00am and got dressed.    
Usually I would put on my school       
uniform but today we were going to Hill
End Camp,a nature reserve in Farmoor.I 
put on some jeans,a shirt and a jumper.
Then I went downstairs to have my      
breakfast of cereal and toast.I sat    
watching T.V while I ate and drank my  
tea.Then I fed the cat and did the     
washing-up.My 2 sisters were just going
to school when Julia(one of them)      
realised I had her jeans on.She made me
change.Then after taking the dog for a 
walk I locked-up and went down to      
Judie's getting my bike out on the way.
I go down to Judie's whenever the house
is empty.At about 8.35am I left to     
cycle to school.When I got there I had 
a quick game of tennis with Ellen.When 
we got to Hill End we went for a walk  
looking for plants/insects until lunch.</content>
