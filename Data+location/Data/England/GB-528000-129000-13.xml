             { (crops)                 
 There are ten farms around Balcombe:  
{Kemps,Bowders,Jarretts,Allens,Yew Tree
{,Northlands,Washland,Great Coopers    
{Corner,Brantridge,West Up.}Most of the
 land around here is owned by Balcombe 
 Estate (Mr. and Mrs. Greenwood).The   
 land around here is very good for     
 growing crops.The farmers grow all    
 kinds of things like:beetroot,sugar   
 beet,grass,corn and wheat.They grow   
 grass for the cows to eat.There are   
 plenty of cows around here.In winter  
 the cows are put into pens and fed    
 sileage.Sileage is the top layer of   
 grass that is taken from the fields in
 spring and left in a heap at the      
 farm.The sheep are put out in the     
 fields in winter and sheared in       
 summer.The fields are harvested in    
 summer also.                          </content>
