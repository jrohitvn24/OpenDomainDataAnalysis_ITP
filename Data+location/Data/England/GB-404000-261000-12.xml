		<title>12MAIN FEATURES OF SAMBOURNE</title>
		<content> One main feature of Sambourne is the  
 village green. In the centre of the   
 green a tree is placed which has seats
 around it. In summer it is a pleasant 
 place to sit.                         
                                       
 On the outskirts is a factory which   
 produces soft drinks. They are made in
 sachets which should be frozen before 
 consumption and sold in summer. In    
 winter they produce candy apples and  
 toffee apples. Many toffee apples are 
 sold for bonfire night. Approximately 
 30 people work here. The company,     
 which started in 1974, makes half a   
 million sachets a week.               
                                       
 The factory is located at Oak Farm,   
 Gill Lane, Sambourne.
