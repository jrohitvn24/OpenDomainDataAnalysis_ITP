		<content> Lymm Dam is a man made lake.  It was  
 formed when the Warrington to         
 Altrincham Road was built across      
 Bradley Brook.  A dam was constructed 
 with sluices allowing the water to    
 pass through.                         
 The land around was owned by Lord     
 Leverhuhue who planted woodland and   
 landscaped the area early in the      
 century.                              
 In recent years the pathways and steep
 slopes have been improved and there is
 now also a Park Ranger Service.  The  
 Rangers have a club for children.  On 
 Saturdays to go on nature walks around
 the Dam.  It takes about half an hour 
 to stroll through the pleasant woods  
 around the lake and it is a local     
 tourist attraction.  The main         
 recreational activity is fishing,     
 where Lymm Anglers compete.           
 Swimming is prohibited.               </content>
