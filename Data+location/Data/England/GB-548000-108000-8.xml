		<title>08Farming in Ripe</title>
		<content>      There are several sheep farmers  
 in the area. Pig farming is also      
 practiced but there are no chicken    
 farms since one closed down due to    
 economic reasons. The Sussex          
 countryside is popular with horse     
 breeders. Ripe has one stud and       
 another farmer specialises in training
 horses to ride and drive.             
      Arable farms are represented by  
 Church Farm, Chalvington which grows  
 vegetables and flowers. Most farmers  
 use a rotation of crops with grass to 
 improve the quality of the soil. This 
 year has been a bad year for many     
 farms as the Spring was wet and cold  
 and the Summer was the same while     
 Autumn, when seeds for Winter crops   
 should have germinated, was too dry.  
      Turfing is a good way of making a
 profit enabling the farmer to carry   
 out draining or other farm improvement</content>
