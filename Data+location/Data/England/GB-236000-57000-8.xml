		<content> The present owner and his wife have   
 two children, a boy of eight and a    
 girl of three. Because of the distance
 involved, the children are provided   
 with transport by the Education       
 Authority to go to school. This is a  
 lonley area with few children to play 
 with although there is plenty of open 
 ground on which to play. The nearest  
 shops are abut three miles away. Milk 
 is delivered to the farm about three  
 times a week. Despite being alone, the
 farmer has time for some hobbies,     
 particularly golf, bridge and         
 gardening.
