There is a United Reformed Church in   
the village.  Services are held at 6   
o'clock on Sunday evenings.  Reverend  
Bolton is the chief minister and he    
lives in Newport Pagnell.              
                                       
Peter Townsend is the Rector of Saint  
James' church.  He came to Paulerspury 
in 1974 and conducts four services     
each Sunday.  He has about eight       
weddings and six christenings a year.  
                                       
In Pury End there is a little          
Methodist church which is not used     
very much now. The minister is         
Reverend Collings who lives in         
Buckingham.
