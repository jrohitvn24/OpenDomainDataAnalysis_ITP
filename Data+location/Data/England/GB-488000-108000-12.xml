 Our breed of cow is a British Friesian
 and can be easily recognised by its   
 black and white markings.  We try to  
 ensure that each cow produces one calf
 every year in the November to         
 September period. Any female claves   
 (heifers) are reared and eventually   
 join the dairy herd at about 2.5 years
 old.These replace older cows which    
 have to be slaughtered because they   
 are no longer economic to keep through
 thier inability to produce a calf,    
 chronic lameness or any disease which 
 affects their milk output performance.
 All bull calves are kept for four     
 weeks, on a diet of milk powder. After
 four weeks they go to market where    
 they are purchased by other farmers to
 be fattened and slaughted as prime    
 beef.                  By Samantha D  </content>
