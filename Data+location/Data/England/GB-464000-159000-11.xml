		<title>11PARKS</title>
		<content> The park is a place where people play.
 But,somewhere in Bramley,there is a   
 park where some builders are going to 
 build some houses.We think it is      
 because Bramley has a lot of grassed  
 open spaces and not many houses.      
 Usually {PARKS}have got things like a 
 climbing frame,3 big swings and 3     
 little swings,a slide and some grass  
 to play on.In Bramley there is a      
 stream flowing through.There is a     
 trunk of a tree across the stream     
 ,which people use to cross over it.   
 At the side of our park are some      
 fields and up abit more on the other  
 side you can see the youth club.      
 On our survey we saw {4 PARKS}        
 ,which,if you think about it,is a lot 
 for one village.
