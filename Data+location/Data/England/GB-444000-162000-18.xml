		<content> We interviewed a Senior Ranger 1, who 
 has been with the Forestry Commission 
 since 1962 and a Senior Ranger 1 for  
 16 years. His job is wildlife         
 conservation, protection of forest    
 crops and protecting the land         
 adjoining his from damage from        
 rabbits,  squirrels and deer. This    
 Ranger is responsable for 7-8,000     
 acres over 33 woods including Penwood 
 in our block. These are mainly Pine   
 and Oak trees and the animals include,
 Fallow deer, Roe deer, foxes, rabbits 
 and muntjak. He has a Landrover with  
 fire fighting gear and 5 beaters. We  
 asked if he has trouble with people   
 disobeying bye laws and he said he    
 finds illegal horse riding, motor     
 cycling, camping and lighting fires.  
 At 11pm when we are all in bed he goes
 to check on the woods from special    
 platforms even if it is raining.      </content>
