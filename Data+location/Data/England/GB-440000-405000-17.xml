		<content> For breakfast I had Cocoa Pops with   
 milk, and a glass of milk. During the 
 morning at school I had a small bottle
 of milk. At dinnertime I went home and
 had spaghetti and mince, with water to
 drink. For tea in the evening I had   
 boiled potatoes, beef and peas, and   
 milk to drink. Sometimes I have bubble
 gum and a chocolate bar. For supper I 
 have crisps and a drink of milk.

 I got up at 8 o'clock and went        
 downstairs. I had a Weetabix with jam 
 and milk on it. Just before playtime  
 at school we had a bottle of milk. For
 school dinner we had creamed potatoes,
 sweet corn, boiled cabbage and roast  
 mutton. We all had a drink of water on
 the table. Then we had pineapple      
 shortcake. When I got home I had an   
 apple and a packet of crinkled crisps.
 Later on I had some salad.            </content>
