		<title>16Wormleighton the Manor House</title>
		<content> The Manor House was built at the      
 beginning of the sixteenth century by 
 the Spencer Family and the first Lord 
 Spencer added the gatehouse built with
 marlstone from the escarpment at      
 Stoneton. A large part of the house   
 was burnt down during the civil war   
 but one wing remains still inhabited. 
 This wing also contains a Star Chamber
 which was used as a magisterial court 
 until 1641 when Star Chamber Courts   
 were discontinued by James 1. The     
 Manor House is now used as a farmhouse
 and the gatehouse provides rented     
 accommodation for two families.
