		<content> Until 1983 the shopping facilities in 
 this block have been of the small     
 corner shop or small local arcade     
 variety.Recently a huge hypermarket   
 has been built on the site of the     
 Solent Motel.Many local traders are   
 complaning that they have lost trade  
 to Tesco store.Some shops have closed 
 and others taken over by the small    
 asian community as food stores or take
 away restaraunts.                     
 There is a{petrol station on the site 
 now so that the local garages are     
 losing business.The hypermarket sells 
 a great variety of things,groceries,  
 wines,d.i.y,clothes,shoes,car         
 servicing parts,vegetables,electrical,
 etc.The checkouts are very automated  
 the prices are scanned with a laser   
 beam and are shown on a screen and on 
 the bill for checking.
