		<title>05DEEPING ST.JAMES HEDGES</title>
		<content>     We went down Back Lane to see     
 how old the hedge was.We had a look to
 see how many main species of trees we 
 could find.We found two,hawthorn and  
 ash,so according to Hooper's Hedge    
 Hypothesis the hedge is roughly two   
 hundred years old.                    
     A long time ago there was a law   
 saying that each person would be given
 a field and they must put a boundary  
 round it. Most people in our area     
 decided to put a hedge around their   
 field.Some fields have got dykes round
 them.This is to help with drainage,as 
 the land is so low lying.             
     While we were there we saw some   
 willow warblers,sparrows,blackbirds   
 and a pied wagtail.                   
     We didn't collect any species of  
 mini beasts because the dyke was in   
 the way.
