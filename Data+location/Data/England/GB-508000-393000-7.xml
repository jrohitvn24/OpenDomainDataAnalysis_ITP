		<title>07ST.MARY'S CHURCH, CLAXBY</title>
		<content> St. Mary's Church site goes back to   
 before 1110's. It is in the diocese   
 of Lincoln and part of the Arch       
 Deaconary of Stow in the West Wold    
 Deanery. United approximately 20 years
 ago with the Walesby Group of Churches
 under the Rector of Walesby it        
 receives little pastoral care at      
 present, with only two services a     
 month. Average attendance of these    
 are: Holy Communion 20, Evensong 12.  
 There are two churchwardens who look  
 after general running of church. There
 are 12 members on the Parochial Church
 Council and 30 on the Church Electoral
 Roll. The church has five fine bells, 
 some with inscriptions on and a good  
 set of hand bells, but alas no one at 
 present to ring them. On the interior 
 wall there is a memorial to those lost
 in two world wars, also to those who  
 returned from war to Claxby.          </content>
