		<content>In June l984,Duke St.Junior School     
6-aside football team won through to   
the "Smith's Cup" national finals at   
Wembley. Two coaches of supporters     
travelled to the Stadium for this      
momentous occasion in front of 35,000  
people.Although we lost, the thrill of 
walking up the players' tunnel,playing 
on the famous turf and climbing the    
steps to the royal box, will remain in 
the boys' memories throughout their    
lives.                                 
The new housing development at Eaves   
Green is to be finished by l986.It     
forms the southern most development    
of Central Lancs New Town.All the      
housing is low-rise with a low density 
per acre.There are plans to divert     
traffic from the town centre of Chorley
along a by-pass following the line of  
Duke Street.
