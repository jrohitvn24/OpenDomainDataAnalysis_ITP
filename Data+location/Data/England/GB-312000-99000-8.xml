		<content> THE HAMLET OF WESTON LIES ASTRIDE THE 
 RIVER OTTER &amp; IS IN THREE PARISHES-   
 AWLISCOMBE, BUCKERELL &amp; GITTISHAM. THE
 CENTRE IS MOSTLY COTTAGES WHICH WERE  
 ORIGINALLY THATCHED BUT ARE NOW ROOFED
 WITH SLATE OR TILE. THE NAME IS       
 PROBABLY A CONTRACTION OF WESSINGTON. 
 THE RIVER WOLF JOINS THE OTTER AT     
 WESTON. REPORT HAS IT THAT IT IS SO   
 NAMED BECAUSE THE LAST WOLF IN ENGLAND
 WAS KILLED THERE. THERE IS A BRIDGE   
 (CHERRY BRIDGE) &amp; A FORD OVER THE WOLF
 &amp; TRAFALGAR BRIDGE CARRIES THE ROAD   
 OVER THE OTTER. PRESUMABLY THE LORD OF
 THE MANOR ONCE LIVED AT WESTON MANOR. 
 WESTON COURT, NEXT DOOR, WAS ONCE THE 
 BARN &amp; STABLES OF THE MANOR. IN THE   
 WALL OF WESTON COURT IS A VICTORIAN   
 LETTERBOX. THERE IS NO CHURCH BUT     
 THERE IS A CHAPEL. THE OTTER INN WITH 
 ITS GARDEN RUNNING DOWN TO THE RIVER  
 IS A FAVOURITE EATING &amp; DRINKING PLACE</content>
