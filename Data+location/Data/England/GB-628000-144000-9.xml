		<content>The A256 runs from Sandwich to the     
junction at Whitfield roundabout, (A2  
London), and is particularly important 
as it divides the village into 2       
halves.                                
As the road is a major route between   
the port of Dover and the Isle of      
Thanet, it is extremely busy carrying  
port workers and commercial heavy goods
vehicles, including car transporters,  
(one every 10 minutes), moving new cars
to depots at Sandwich, waste disposal  
lorries and bulk coal carriers from    
Tilmanstone.                           
Everyone living on the west side of the
village has to cross this road to get  
to the library, village hall, school   
and to visit 2 of the old people's     
homes. Those living on the east side   
have to cross to visit the doctors     
surgery, post office, grocery store and
the newsagents.                        </content>
