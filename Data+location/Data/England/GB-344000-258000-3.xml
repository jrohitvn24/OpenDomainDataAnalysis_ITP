		<title>03HOUSING IN WEST LEOMINSTER</title>
		<content>   There are two housing estates in the
 east of the area - one private and one
 mixed - both built in the last fifteen
 years.  Some of these houses are built
 on the site of a second world war U.S.
 Military Hospital.                    
   Apart from these estates the housing
 is isolated and scattered  consisting 
 mostly of old farmhouses and cottages,
 some of which are tied cottages.      
   Some are in the old traditional     
 black and white style, which is a     
 feature of the county in general.     
 Some building is still taking place,  
 but the estates are nearing           
 completion.
