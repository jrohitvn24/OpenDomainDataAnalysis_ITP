		<content> Fashion plays an important part in    
 our lives.Fashion manufacturers start 
 their clothes at size 8.There are     
 fashion ranges for all kinds of       
 people: for instance,{Punks,Mods}and  
 fashion conscious teenagers.Most      
 fashions are bought in High street    
 chain stores like{Top Shop,Dorothy    
{Perkins, Foster &amp;  Chelsea Girl}.Most 
 of these shops sell clothes for both  
 sexes and are usually very expensive  
 because of the designers              
 labels.Unfortunately fashion changes  
 constantly and it can be costly to    
 keep up with it.Jewellery is usually  
 worn to add a bit more life to the    
 latest fashions people have           
 bought.Junk jewellery is coloured     
 plastic cut into different shapes for 
 earings and big chunky beads.Men      
 sometimes wear chains and other       
 articles of expensive jewellery.      </content>
