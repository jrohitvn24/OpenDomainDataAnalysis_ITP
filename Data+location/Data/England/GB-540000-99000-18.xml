		<content> The gentle contours of the South Downs
 leading down to the English Channel   
 attracted businessman Charles Neville 
 to think of a garden city by the sea. 
  By 1921 the first house was ready for
 occupation.Many more were in the      
 course of erection and most of the    
 area near the clifftop had been divide
 into more plots for sale,each 25feet  
 wide and 100 feet deep.               
  By 1924 Neville's estate company had 
 helped three thousand people to       
 complete their homes in               
 Peacehaven,whose names had been chosen
 in a newspaper competition with       
 building plots as prizes.             
  Not all the winners had houses built 
 and plots where no building was done  
 still remain empty today.
