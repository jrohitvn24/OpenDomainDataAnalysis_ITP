		<content> Work undertaken by class J1/2H (7/8   
 yrs)at Blaby Stokes Primary School.{  
{ Results:}(424 people questioned)     
{ A-}72% had always lived within a 10  
 mile radius of Blaby.                 
{ B-}27% moved to Blaby from locations 
 throughout Great Britain(no particular
 pattern apparent).                    
{ C-}1% moved to Blaby from foreign    
 countries, (ie. people of African or  
 Indian origin).                       
 Marriage and work have proved to be   
 the two main causes of bringing       
 people into the area.Blaby has        
 developed greatly as a residential    
 and commercial centre since the Great 
 War.A large number of people are      
 still of local origin.As yet,there is 
 little impact from Commonwealth       
 Immigration and the area still        
 retains its mono-cultural character   
 with little multi-ethnic influence.   </content>
