{Scotland Lodge Farm}opened in its     
 present form as a racing stables in   
 1981, taking up to 34 horses at a     
 time. They are mostly owned privately 
 and placed here for training.         
                                       
 The horses are a familiar sight       
 locally when they are being exercised 
 on the roads.                         
                                       
 Training is for flat-racing, hurdling 
 and steeple-chasing and the horses are
 taken to race-meetings all over the   
 country, from Newton Abbot in the     
 south-west to Ayr in the north.
