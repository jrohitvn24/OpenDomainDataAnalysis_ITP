		<content> THE PLANTATION                        
 SOMETIMES IT IS CALLED THE WOODS.WE   
 WENT FOR A WALK THROUGH IT WITH OUR   
 TEACHER AND MR. CARRUTHERS.           
 LEAVING SCHOOL WE WALKED PAST THE     
 FORGE,ACROSS THE FIELD,AND WATCHED    
 SPARROW HAWKS DIVING FOR THEIR        
 PREY.LOTS OF RABBITS WERE NEAR THE    
 HEDGES.BY THE PATH ,WE SAW BUTTERCUPS 
 DAISIES, DANDELIONS AND SPEEDWELL.AS  
 WE WALKED ALONG THE OLD RAILWAY TRACK 
 WE SAW POPPIES,CLOVER AND WILD HOPS.  
  MR.CARRUTHERS SHOWED US HOW THE BIRDS
 HID THEIR NESTS IN THE HEDGES,AND     
 WHERE THE FALLOW DEER HAD EATEN THE   
 BARK OFF SOME YOUNG TREES.            
 NEAR THE LOCK THERE WERE COOTS,GREBE, 
 AND MOORHENS,BUT I DID NOT SEE A HERON
 THIS TIME.DOWN AT THE MILL POND WE SAW
 A SWAN'S NEST AND FIVE CYGNETS.       
                                       
                                       </content>
