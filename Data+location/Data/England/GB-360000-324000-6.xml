		<title>06ARABLE FARMING</title>
		<content>      All farmers in the area grow     
 cereals,  potatoes, sugar beet or a   
 combinations of these.  Wheat and     
 Barley are mostly grown under contract
 and sold back to the contractor for   
 animal feeds, seed, malting or        
 milling.  A combine harvester harvests
 the cereal crops: it cuts the corn,   
 threshes it &amp; stores it in a large bin
 for augering into trailers ready for  
 carting to the farm for storage.  The 
 straw is then baled and used for      
 bedding livestock.  The maize is grown
 for animal feed.  The sugar beet is   
 grown under contract to the British   
 Sugar Corporation, with the farmer    
 buying back the waste pulp for animal 
 feed.  The potatoes are sold by the   
 farmers privately at Â£1.75 per half   
 cwt or bought in bulk by contract.
