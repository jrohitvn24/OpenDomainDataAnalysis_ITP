		<title>16RECREATION IN TERLING</title>
		<content>   Many of the activities in the       
 village have been mentioned in our    
 pages on Clubs, but here are some more
 which are not really clubs.           
      The Playgroup is now well        
 attended and in term time is on every 
 Tuesday and Thursday from 9.30.am     
 until 12noon in the village hall. This
 is for children from two and a half up
 to school age at nearly five.         
     The Village Hall, which was built 
 by voluntary labour, is widely used   
 for a number of activities including  
 Dances, Discos, Concerts, Plays,      
 Badminton and Meetings.               
    The only spectator sports are      
 Football and Cricket, whilst the other
 sports are for people's private       
 recreation. Many people spend their   
 leisure time in the summer relaxing in
 the attractive setting of the swimming
 pool.                                 </content>
