 There is strong feeling over the state
 of the river, the majority being      
 unhappy with its present  upkeep.     
 Many people would be happy and willing
 to help with a voluntary effort to    
 clear the river.  People are generally
 satisfied with the state of the       
 footpaths.  Most people are in favour 
 of more tree planting  and favoured   
 indigenous varieties such as horse    
 chestnut, hornbeam, beech and lime.   
 Many people are dissatisfied with  the
 materials and design used in new and  
 restored buildings in the village.    
 Most people would like to see the     
 Tithe Barn restored, but this would be
 a very costly scheme.
