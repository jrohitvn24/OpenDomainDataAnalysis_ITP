		<title>11RELIGION HALWELL &amp; MORELEIGH</title>
		<content> The Churches of St. Leonard at Halwell
 and All Saints at Moreleigh play an   
 important and unifying part in the    
 life of the two villages.  The Church 
 festivals during the year give ample  
 scope for gatherings such as Harvest  
 Suppers, flower festivals, socials    
 and fund raising events.              
 In 1844 an independent Non-Conformist 
 Chapel was built but it is now unused 
 and derelict.                         
 St. Leonar's Church Halwell was built 
 in perpendicular style in the late    
 15th C. and substantially added to in 
 1897.Its six bells were recast in 1763
 from a previous peal of four.         
 All Saints' Church Moreleigh is       
 reputed to have been built as a       
 penance for the killing of the Rector 
 of Woodleigh in a quarrel.  It was    
 restored in the late 19thC and again  
 in 1934.                              </content>
