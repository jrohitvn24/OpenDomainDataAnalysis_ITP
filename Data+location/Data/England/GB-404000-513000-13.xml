 area is called the Tees.It is a fast  
 flowing river with pools and rapids.On
 its banks are boulders,shingle,       
 limestone,sandstone and whinstone     
 washed down from upstream.There is a  
 limestone gorge to the east of our    
 area near Abbey Bridge.There are five 
 disused{mills,} one is in ruins and   
 another is used temporarily as a book 
 shop.The others are homes.The trees   
 growing by the river include Ash,Alder
 ,Sycamore and Elm.Many of the Elms are
 suffering from{Dutch Elm Disease.}Lots
 of the fields are full of flowers such
 as buttercups,hedge parsley.Hawthorn  
 bushes and Blackthorn bushes are      
 common.
