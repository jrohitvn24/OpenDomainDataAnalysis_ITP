		<title>20Home Entertainment.</title>
		<content> The most common form of home          
 entertainment is watching television. 
 This has been slightly altered in the 
 last few years by two new ideas.      
 The first of these is the growth of   
 the home video market.Many people     
 prefer to watch these to the broadcast
 programmes.                           
 The second factor is the growth of the
 home computer market.Many people      
 (especially children)prefer to play   
 one of a wide variety of games        
 available.                            
 Of course there are still many        
 traditional games played as well.
