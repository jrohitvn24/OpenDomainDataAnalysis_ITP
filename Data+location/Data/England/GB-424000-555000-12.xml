 Brick Works is famous for its bricks. 
 The R.O.F. makes bullets, shells and  
 ammunition. The Marshalling Yard is   
 beside the railway lines and it is    
 used for changing carriages on trains.
 Birtley Manufacturing makes iron      
 lintels and garage doors.             
                                       
    The Caterpillar used to be one of  
 the biggest factories until it closed 
 down in 1984. It made tractors and    
 building equipment. there are two coal
 mines near Kibblesworth that are      
 closed down now.
