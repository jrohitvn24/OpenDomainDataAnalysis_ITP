<title>21St Paul's RC School</title>

<content>The school was, initially, run by the Sisters of Notre Dame and the headmistress was Sister Kevin assisted by Sister Anthony and some secular teachers. I and my sister and brother were all there at the same time leading up to the outbreak of war. A very large underground air raid shelter was built at the west end of the schoolclose to the senior class. At some stage it received a direct hit but I cannot remember whether there were fatalities.&lt;br />
