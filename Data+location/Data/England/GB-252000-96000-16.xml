		<title>16LIFE ON A DEVON FARM 2</title>
		<content> Life at Oak Gates Farm in 1985 is     
 sometimes very hectic especially in   
 the summer when the sun shines and    
 there are so many jobs to do on the   
 farm and young people need driving to 
 work and social occasions. There is   
 not a lot of social life in this area 
 especially for young people and       
 children unless you are prepared to   
 travel to nearby towns, which means   
 owning a car is almost a necessity.   
 The children have to travel to school 
 by coach, most of them being picked up
 at their homes, which in many cases   
 means that children from towns have   
 further to walk to school. The school 
 bus also acts as a service bus which  
 is new to this area. We also have a   
 bus to Okehampton twice a week and to 
 Exeter and Holsworthy once a month for
 shopping trips. It is interesting     
 meeting tourists in the summer.       </content>
