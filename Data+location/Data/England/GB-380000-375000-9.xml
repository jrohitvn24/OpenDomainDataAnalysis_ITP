		<title>09SEDDON ESTATE, CHELFORD cont</title>
		<content>    Noise is not a problem from either 
 the building of the estate or the     
 railway station but the estate has    
 some aircraft noise as it is under the
 flight path for Manchester airport.   
 Quite a few people would like to see  
 more shops and lesuire facilities     
 convenient.                           
    Most people found the travelling   
 convenient because they expect to use 
 their cars and are close to the       
 motorway. Suggestions for three       
 improvements brought many individual  
 ideas. The main ones were to move the 
 flight path of the aircraft, more     
 shops with perhaps a supermarket, a   
 nearby school and a post office on the
 estate. Most people said their were no
 disadvantages to living on the estate 
 although a few people mentioned you   
 did need to have a car. The response  
 to our survey was about 1 in 10.      </content>
