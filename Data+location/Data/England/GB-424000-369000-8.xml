		<content> Your tour of the gardens begins just  
 above the House, where outside the    
 Orangery are the herbaceous borders   
 ablaze with brilliant colours. Beyond 
 the South Front of the House is a lime
 hedge planted in 1952. Next is the    
 Canal, a long artificial lake with the
 famous Emperor Fountain, the highest  
 gravity-fed fountain in Europe. At the
 end of the Canal is the Azalea Dell   
 and then the Pinetum occupying seven  
 acres.                                
 The Yew Maze occupies the site of the 
 old Paxton Conservatory. At one end is
 a bed of 2000 lupins. Below this is   
 the double srepentine beech hedge.    
 Ahead on your right is the Cascade,   
 where water flows down a series of    
 stone steps. There are several        
 greenhouses growing many exotic plants
 and Paxton's Glass Wall housing mainly
 Camelias and Peaches.                 </content>
