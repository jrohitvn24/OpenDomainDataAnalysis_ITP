		<title>15CLOPTONS TRANSPORT</title>
		<content> There is one bus service through the  
 village of Clopton, running twice a   
 week. It runs from Woodbridge to      
 Ipswich and back. There are also 2    
 school buses run by the local County  
 Council to take the children to       
 Grundisburgh Primary School and       
 Farlingaye High School at Woodbridge. 
 There are no railway services, the    
 nearest being either Ipswich or       
 Woodbridge, and there are no airports 
 locally. The nearest ferry-port is at 
 Felixstowe.                           
 Most people have their own transport  
 in the form of cars or bicycles.
