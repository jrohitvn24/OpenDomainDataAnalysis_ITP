		<title>14MULTICULTURAL S.E.LUTON</title>
		<content> Many families who moved to England    
 from other countries eventually       
 settled in S.E. Luton. This century   
 the main immigrant groups have been   
 from Ireland, the Caribbean and Asia, 
 (especially Pakistan and Bangladesh). 
 This injection of different cultures, 
 religions, accents and languages has  
 changed the area into a multicultural 
 society. In Bury Park is located a    
 mosque,built by the Muslim community. 
 This area also contains a number of   
 shops and restaurants specialising in 
 Asian food. At Stockwood High School, 
 which serves most of the area, a      
 survey of languages spoken by pupils  
 in Years 1 to 3 revealed Arabic,      
 Bengali,Cantonese,Danish,English,     
 Gujerati,Italian,Punjabi,Swedish,     
 Turkish,and Urdu.
