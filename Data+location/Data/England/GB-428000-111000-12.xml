		<title>12Housing In The Area</title>
		<content> The houses tend to be detatched or    
 semi-detatched with a few terraces.   
 A large proportion are over 100 years 
 old with a small proportion of modern 
 houses which have been built since the
 second world war. The majority are    
 brick built, with a small percentage  
 of stone and wood. These tend to be   
 the older houses. The main roofing    
 material is tile, but there is still a
 considerable number with slate and a  
 smaller number of thatch remaining.   
 The houses tend to be larger than     
 average with 4 or more bedrooms, very 
 few of the 1/2 bedroom type.The       
 majority have 2 or more rooms         
 on the ground floor, many with the    
 addition of utility rooms and/or      
 cloakrooms.   Some families have lived
 in the area for centuries but there   
 has been a steady influx of new       
 families now owning cars.             </content>
