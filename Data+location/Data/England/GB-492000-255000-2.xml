 On The Green are three buildings, a   
 War Memorial, a l9th.century Lock-Up, 
 and an l8th. century Butter           
 Market.Surrounding the Green are many 
 old buildings.                        
 Other facilities include a Lower      
 School, Harrold Priory Middle School, 
 a Fire Station, and a Doctor's        
 Surgery.                              
 There are four churches; a Church of  
 England where I go, a Roman Catholic, 
 a United Reformed, and an Evangelical 
 Church.                               
 I think that Harrold could do with a  
 chemist, but I do not want to see any 
 more houses built here as I like it   
 this size. I like living in Harrold as
 there are always lots of things to do.
