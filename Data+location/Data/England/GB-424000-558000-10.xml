		<title>10A DAY IN MY LIFE  A.PHAROH</title>
		<content> My name is Andrea Pharoh. I am 12     
 years old, I live in Raby Street,     
 Gateshead and I attend Lyndhurst      
 School. On a school day I get up at   
 7.45am and have my breakfast, which is
 usually a bowl of Frosties. Then I get
 washed and put on my school uniform.  
 At 8.15am I leave the house and walk  
 to a friend's house, a few minutes    
 away. Then we go to catch a bus to    
 school. School starts at 9.00am when  
 we are registered. At 11.10 there is a
 break of 15 minutes when the tuck shop
 is open. Lunch is 12.20 to 1.25pm and 
 school ends at 3.30pm.                
 I usually have a big dinner at tea    
 time and then help my mam wash up. At 
 6.00pm I go out. On Monday's I go to  
 the Guides and on other nights I go   
 out with friends. At 9.30pm I often   
 have a bath and then watch television 
 until 10.30 when I go to bed.         </content>
