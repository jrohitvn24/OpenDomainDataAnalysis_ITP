		<content> Game {PLEASE MR CROCODILE}            
 Small children play this game in the  
 playground.One person is chosen to be 
 Mr Crocodile and the others stand in  
 front of him they ask the crocodile if
 they can cross his river this is what 
 they shout,please Mr Crocodile may we 
 cross the water to see the kings      
 daughter what's the colour next? Then 
 the crocodile names a colour and if   
 the children are wearing that colour  
 they have to run across past where the
 crocodile is standing and back without
 getting hit by the crocodile.The older
 children often play a game called     
{VICTORY.}In this game you have two    
 lines either side of the              
 playground.Behind these lines is safe 
 from the person who is hit.The others 
 run from line to line trying not to   
 get hit if they do get hit they are   
 hit with the other child who is hit.  </content>
