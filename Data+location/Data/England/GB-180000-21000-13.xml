 In Porthallow there are 15 fishing    
 boats, two of which take tourists on  
 fishing trips.  The best place to     
 catch fish is off the wreck of the    
 'Volany' which is one mile off shore. 
 Another good place is White Rocks     
 which is near Nare Point. Another     
 wreck for fishing is that of the      
 'Panama' which went down in the 'Great
 Blizzard' of 1891.  Mackerel and baby 
 Pollack are two of the chief catches. 
 Fishing off the rocks at Porthallow   
 you can catch quite big Wrasse and    
 sometimes little Dab.  You can often  
 find tackle on the beach.  Fishing    
 starts about May and carries on until 
 about the end of September depending  
 on the weather.  There is a winch on  
 the beach for pulling boats up; it is 
 not very strong but it can help.
