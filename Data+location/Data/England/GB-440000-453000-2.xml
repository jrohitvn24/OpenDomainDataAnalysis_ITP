		<title>02A CHILD'S DAY</title>
		<content>  The first thing I do is get up at 8  
 o'clock. I get washed and brush my    
 teeth.Then I go downstairs and into   
 the kitchen.I brush my hair and have  
 my breakfast.I have Weetabix for      
 breakfast.After that I make sure all  
 my school things are ready.I find my  
 flute and my flute music.I look at my 
 pet lambs,pick up my school bag and   
 say goodbye to my dog.I climb into my 
 dad's car and we go down to the white 
 gate (it is a mile down the lane)and  
 wait for Mr.Conning.He takes me to    
 school in a bus.Victoria is the next  
 person we pick up across the{A.1.}Next
 he picks up Gareth and Christine,     
 Matthew and Sarah at Cowthorpe.Then we
 go up to school.I get my maths out and
 do that.Then I do some English.We have
 dinner at 12 o'clock.We sometimes have
 salad for dinner(salad is all         
 vegetables grown in the ground).      </content>
