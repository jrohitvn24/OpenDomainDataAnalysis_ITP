		<content> Me and my grandad and Sam the dog go  
 up the Gorse at the back of Eskdale   
 Close .It is a massive place to       
 play.Dead Man's Valley is a really    
 deep pit at the top of the Gorse.It is
 about 60 feet deep.If you fall in you 
 can't get out again.People say there  
 are bones buried there from people who
 have fallen in!                       
   I have got a B.M.X.track in the back
 garden.We have a ramp and a water     
 pipe.We put a skid at the bottom,and a
 grass heap in the middle.There is a   
 proper B.M.X. track at Warndon made of
 clay and old tyres.                   
  We make a play house in the garden.  
 Tamsyn's play house is just like a    
 real house. It's in the back toilet.  
 Stevan has a base at Mayfield         
 carpark.It has windows and a          
 shelter.It's made of stone.Colin has a
 base on the Gorse.                    </content>
