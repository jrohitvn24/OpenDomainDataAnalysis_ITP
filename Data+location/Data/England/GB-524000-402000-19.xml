		<title>19A Waltham Child's Day.</title>
		<content>   Most mornings I get up at 7.45a.m.  
 but at weekends at about 8.15a.m.     
 After my favourite breakfast,bacon and
 egg, I have a wash and clean my teeth 
 in the bathroom.As I am usually late, 
 I rush upstairs and put on my blouse  
 and jodphurs.If necessary,I wash my   
 riding boots and collect my hat and   
 crop.Mum gives me my swimming kit and 
 says,"Have a nice time."              
   Dad drives me to a local village    
 riding school where I like to have my 
 lesson on Taffy because he is the     
 fastest.On the way back from riding I 
 change into my plimsolls.When we reach
 the School I hurry to the swimming    
 pool.After 30 minutes swimming I go   
 back home,dry my hair and eat lunch.  
   During the rest of the day I go     
 shopping in town with my parents or,  
 play with my friends,then watch       
 television before going to bed.       </content>
