		<title>02Places to visit,Stevington</title>
		<content> There are a number of places which    
 people visit.Below the wall on the    
 eastern boundary of the churchyard can
 be found the Holy Well where water    
 from a spring gushes forth.On the     
 outskirts of the village is the       
 Stevington Country Walk which has been
 developed by the County Council to    
 provide a pleasant two mile leisurely 
 walk.The track follows the route of a 
 former railway.The windmill stands on 
 the east side of the village.It is    
 owned by the County Council and is a  
 restored eighteenth century postmill. 
 Visitors may climb up the steps and   
 enter the mill to view the main       
 working parts.In the centre of the    
 village is a stone cross.It is often  
 used as the focal point and both young
 and old sit around it passing         
 the time of day.
