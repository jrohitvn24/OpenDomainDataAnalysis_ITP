		<title>11Cotswold Stone Quarrying (2)</title>
		<content> There is a layer of blue clay all over
 the Cotswolds. Between this and the   
 silica lies Pendle stone which is used
 for slates. The clay is water-tight   
 and a lake of one hectare is being    
 made at Huntsmans Quarry. Water from  
 this is pumped to the stone-washing   
 machinery. Dirty water is pumped away 
 to a slime pit. There is a borehole 90
 metres deep which provides domestic   
 water at the quarry for the adjacent  
 farm and the 20 employees during their
 8-hour working day.                   
 20 separate specifications of material
 can be produced e.g. granular sub-base
 materials for road construction,      
 various types of single-size stone    
 chippings. Distribution is generally  
 within a radius of 3 km. Exceptions   
 include fine dust to Bargoed, S.Wales 
 and walling stone to Manchester.
