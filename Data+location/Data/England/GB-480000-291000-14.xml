		<content> St. Mary's Church at Nevill Holt is no
 longer a Parish Church but owned by   
 the adjoining school. A senior master 
 conducts an informal service every    
 week day for pupils and staff and a   
 service is held every Sunday,         
 sometimes conducted by a lay preacher 
 or visiting Rector.  There are no     
 regular services during school        
 holidays.                             
 Drayton has the smallest church in    
 Leicestershire.  A Chapelry of        
 Bringhurst, services are held twice   
 monthly, alternating Communion and    
 Evensong.                             
 Besides St.Giles Church at Medbourne  
 there is a Congregational Chapel where
 afternoon services are held but are   
 sparsely attended.                    
 There is a small regular attendance at
 all these churches with a greater     
 number at Christmas,Easter and Harvest</content>
