		<content> Tynemouth has the ruins of a Castle   
 and a Priory both occupying the same  
 headland overloking the mouth of the  
{River Tyne }.                         
{Tynemouth Castle}                     
 The Castle began life in about the    
 year 650 as a wall and gate into the  
 Benedictine monastery, and steadily   
 grew in importance as a fortress      
 because of its position not too far   
 from the Scottish border and at the   
 mouth of the River Tyne. The site has 
 continued to be of great military     
 importance right up to modern times.  
 Gun positions used in World War II    
 (1939-1945) can still be seen. The    
 gatehouse was occupied by the armed   
 forces until 1936 when it was gutted  
 by fire. Since 1960 it has been a     
 major attraction for tourism.
