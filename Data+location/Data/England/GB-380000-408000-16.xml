		<title>16 THE ELDERLY - HOLLY COURT</title>
		<content> Holly Court is a private home for the 
 elderly built in 1972. It was financed
 by the Anchor Housing Association and 
 has a Warden and 38 tenants.          
 Each tenant has their own bedsit room 
 and there is a separate lounge with   
 cooking facilities. There is also a   
 guest room so that friends or family  
 can visit. There are social activities
 such as bingo, coffee mornings, and   
 sing-songs.                           
 A well equipped laundry room is       
 heavily used and constant hot water is
 supplied from the boiler room. Safety 
 is always a priority and Mrs. Platt,  
 the Warden contacts each tenant by    
 intercom between 9am. and 9.30am every
 day. The tenants suggested that the   
 children might want to put their names
 down because the waiting list was so  
 long !  {St. Thomas's C.E. Primary
