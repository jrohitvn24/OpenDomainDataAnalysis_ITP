		<content>SUBMARINE SYSTEMS. Special transistors 
and integrated circuits for submarine  
transmission have been developed.      
Telecom supply the ultra-high          
reliability transistors used by        
Standard Telephones and Cables for     
their systems.                         
SATELITES. British Telecom is in the   
forefront of small earth station       
technology. A 3m dish aerial was used  
at Martlesham for early European video 
conference trials.In April 1984 digital
models and video codes designed at     
Martlesham were used at a major        
international video conference held    
simultaneously in Tokyo, Sydney,       
Philadelphia, Toronto and London.      
INFORMATION NETWORK-There is a growing 
need for non-voice services. At        
Martlesham many new network            
capabilities and new forms of network  
have been produced.                    </content>
