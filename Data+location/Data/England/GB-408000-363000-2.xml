     I live near the area which we are 
studying - it is just up the road.  I  
am dealing with Longnor Wood and the   
area around it.                        
                                       
     I visited a house called Wood     
Cottage which is at the edge of the    
wood and was built in 1853. It used to 
be called Millmoorhead Cottage.        
                                       
     Longnor Wood is owned by the      
Harpur Crewe Estate and the trees are  
all conifers.                          
                                       
     The ground in my area is mostly   
pasture or wood.  There are only 3     
houses in this area.  It is not a flat 
area and is mostly hilly.  A road      
passes through the area which links    
Longnor and Leek.
