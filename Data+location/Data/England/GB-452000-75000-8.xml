		<content> Great changes were effected in the    
 area when Steephill Castle and the    
 Royal National Hospital for Diseases  
 of the Chest, were demolished and     
 St.Lawrence Hall the home of Earl     
 Jellicoe was destroyed by fire.       
 However, one building of outstanding  
 character still remains; the house at 
{Lislecombe} where{Alfred Noyes,}the   
 poet, lived. Today his son Hugh and   
 his family live here and  devote their
 time to running a dairy farm.         
 The farm has 160 acres of land on     
 which Mr.Noyes keeps 170 Friesian     
 cows. The beautiful garden overlooking
 Orchard Bay has many tall graceful    
 trees and unusual shrubs. The grounds 
 are used for the breeding of{rare     
{duck}and other birds. There are also  
 many different varieties of flowers   
 and 7 different kinds of fruit trees  
 in the garden.                        </content>
