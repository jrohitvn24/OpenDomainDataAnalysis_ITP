		<title>01HOW PENSBY HAS CHANGED</title>
		<content>     The population of Pensby has      
 changed a lot over the years.More     
 people have arrived so more houses    
 have been built.It has grown from a   
 few cottages and farms to a large     
 residential area.                     
     To help us to find out how Pensby 
 has changed over the past hundred     
 years we spoke to some of the old folk
 from Barnston "Over 60's Club."       
     In 1927 there were only fifty     
 houses and two shops in Pensby: The   
 8 o'clock shop was a small post office
 selling coal, and the chip shop on the
 corner of Gills Lane used to be a     
 general store, selling vegetables and 
 groceries. There were usually six     
 people living in a house with only    
 candles for light and no gas or       
 electricity.
