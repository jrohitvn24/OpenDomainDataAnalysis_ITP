		<content> The new Strawberry Hill houses have 4 
 bedrooms. The area they are building  
 on is very muddy and dusty. There are 
 4 bedroom houses, 3 bedroom houses and
 2 bedroom houses being built. We      
 have a lot of workmen coming in and   
 out of the house because our house is 
 not finshed completely.I liked living 
 in my old house more becouse it was   
 bigger.We moved to our new house      
 because it was smaller.  We have been 
 quite lucky with our house because    
 next door to us they have had water   
 coming out of the toilet and out of   
 the shower.

 On the South Coast Road there are some
 old nineteenth century coastguard     
 cottages built from flint, but the new
 houses are brick or board.
