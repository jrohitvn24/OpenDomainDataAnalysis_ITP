		<content> Bicycle Moto Cross racing started in  
 England 6 years ago. 2 years ago a    
 committee of 12 parents began to      
 prepare a track on Wasborough Fields  
 paid for by Grove and Wantage Councils
 and by grants from the local Sports   
 Council. Mr. Eddings is the overall   
 organiser.  On July 15th 1984, the    
 committee launched the first BMX race 
 meeting. The 180-190 local members    
 meet officially once a month. All     
 members are insured and ages range    
 from 5+ - 16+ and then a 25+.         
 Meetings are at 3 levels, Open        
 Meetings (local), Regional (S. Central
 England) and National. The biggest    
 Grove event so far, was on May 6th    
 (450) riders and this was a Regional  
 Meeting. Trophies given by sponsors   
 are presented to winners. BMX bikes   
 can cost from Â£80 -Â£400 and protective
 suits are Â£30 - Â£40.                  </content>
