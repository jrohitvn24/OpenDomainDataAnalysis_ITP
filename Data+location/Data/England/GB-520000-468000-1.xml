		<title>01INTRODUCTION TO FLAMBOROUGH</title>
		<content> The chalk cliffs which curve from     
 Sewerby to Flamborough Head are topped
 by a thin layer of boulder clay. They 
 are naturally breached at Danes Dyke  
 &amp; South Landing, both of which are now
 nature trails. Flamborough, a former  
 fishing village, is situated 2 miles  
 inland from the eastern tip of the    
 promontary. It now depends mainly on  
 tourism &amp; farming, nearby Bridlington 
 provides some employment. There are   
 small guest houses but most accommoda-
 tion is residential &amp; includes a      
 council estate. Much of the population
 is made up of retired people. The     
 village has a church, chapel, primary 
 school &amp; a few shops which cater for  
 the immediate needs of locals and     
 tourists. Sewerby has few residents,  
 most of the housing being holiday     
 accommodation. There are 2 churches, 2
 shops, a private school &amp; Sewerby Hall</content>
