 the summer every year. When Mrs.      
 Steward, used to live at Rookery Farm 
 she  let the organisers use her       
 meadows. A band could parade around   
 in them. Most people in Reepham attend
 the Spectacular.It is a family day    
 out.There are raffles,tractor displays
 ,roundabouts,and sometimes a traction 
 engine and a threshing machine.       
 Sometimes there is a bouncy castle.   
  Now it is held in Reepham Market     
 Place.Lot's of different stalls are   
 there, including stalls held by       
 different clubs and groups.The stalls 
 were made up of different things.This 
 year, there was a stall held by the   
 Reepham R.A.T.S. On it,they had things
 made of wool,and clothes.They also    
 had a 'kill the rat' competition.
