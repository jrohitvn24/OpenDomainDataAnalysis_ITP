		<content>{The Disused Railway Line              
                                       
   The railway  line was part of the   
 main Grimsby to London King's Cross   
 branch line which connected Spalding  
 to Boston.It was closed in 1970.It is 
 now overgrown with hawthorn bushes,   
 brambles,clover,chervil and other wild
 flowers. There is lots of wild life   
 such as small birds and animals       
 hedgehogs etc, and lots of insects.It 
 is good for nature walks, walking your
 dogs,a short cut on the way to school,
 motor bike scrambling and picking     
 brambles.The scouts use it for compass
 bearing and tracking.The school often 
 uses it for a short cut to the church 
 or for nature walks.The children often
 play there.
