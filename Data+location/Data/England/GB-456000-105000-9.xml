		<content> The town has grown so quickly that    
 open spaces are not as plentiful as   
 they might be.There are several       
 recreation grounds scattered about the
 town and these are used very fully    
 both for organised sport and childrens
 games.The town boasts its own cricket 
 and football teams and has a stadium  
 for sports and football.              
 A swimming pool has been built and    
 this year work has started on a large 
 leisure centre situated adjacent to   
 the pool.Many of the secondary schools
 have been designated community schools
 and one or two have large sports halls
 for public use.                       
 Yachting and sailing is a great local 
 sport as is wind surfing.One favourite
 leisure time activity is just simply  
 lazing on the shore watching the ships
 go by.
