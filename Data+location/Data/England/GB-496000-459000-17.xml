		<title>17Garton C.E. Church Part 2</title>
		<content> The Department of the Environment has 
 designated the building as 'A Church  
 of International Importance'.         
 Unfortunately the paintings now need  
 restoring and the cost has been       
 estimated at Â£250,000. Although the   
 roof is sound the external sandstone  
 is crumbling and repairs will incur a 
 further Â£135,000.                     
 The Vicar also looks after two other  
 churches.He holds one service in      
 Garton Church every Sunday, sometimes 
 two.The congregation,which has        
 increased slightly,is usually about   
 thirty.This is better than in many    
 nearby villages.The Vicar feels that  
 the role of the church is not as      
 important as it used to be because the
 majority of villagers do not attend   
 regularly.However most people still   
 like to feel that the church is there 
 for funerals,weddings and baptisms.   </content>
