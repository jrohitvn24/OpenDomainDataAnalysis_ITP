		<content>    This page is concerned, not with   
 the local school, but with the        
 education of the people who live in   
 the village, who, as we have seen,    
 come mainly from outside.             
    We asked at what age schooling had 
 been started and at what age finished.
 Most of the people started school at  
 the age of four or earlier but the    
 school leaving ages were much more    
 varied. The majority had left school  
 by sixteen but a significant number   
 (18 out of 46 ) had stayed to 'A'     
 level.                                
    Almost 50% had received no further 
 education but the rest had either been
 apprentices or students at university 
 or colleges of various kinds.
