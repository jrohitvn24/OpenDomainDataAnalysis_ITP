		<title>09A DAY IN BEN DALE'S LIFE</title>
		<content> A typical day for me would be to get  
 up at 7.00 and then at 7.30 have a    
 bowl of Frosties. I get ready for     
 school at 8.20 and go round for my    
 friend Peter. We get to school at     
 about 8.45,we play until 9.00.We      
 usually do maths in the morning. After
 dinner we usually do history or topic.
 At 2.15 we have a 20 minutes playtime.
 After playtime we have P.E.,reading or
 story. At 3.30 we leave school. When I
 get home I get changed and then I     
 usually play with Peter, We play games
 like hide and seek and man hunt.      
 I usually have my tea at about 5.15.  
 after tea I either go to cubs or play 
 out on my bike. I go in at 8.15 and   
 watch television or read books. I have
 cherry cheese cake and a cup of cocoa.
 I go to bed at about 9.30.
