		<title>01Dunford Moors</title>
		<content> This block is dominated by eroded,    
 boggy, cotton grass moorland, with    
 heather, bilberry, and mat grass on   
 the dryer slopes.  This presents very 
 poor grazing, but rights are held by  
 farms at Windleden (to the South) and 
 Hazelhead Hall ( to the East) of this 
 block.  Separate shooting rights (red 
 grouse) are held, and a gamekeeper    
 employed at Harden Lodge to protect   
 them.  Although three quarters of this
 block fall within the Peak National   
 Park, there is no public access, a    
 bone of contention between ramblers   
 and the land and lease holders, with  
 the gamekeeper caught in the middle.  
 Isolated dwellings exist at Harden,   
 Snittlegate, and Long Ing; and even   
 the main settlement at Dunford Bridge 
 has only a few houses. Pic-nic sites  
 have been created by the recently     
 constructed Winscar reservoir.        </content>
