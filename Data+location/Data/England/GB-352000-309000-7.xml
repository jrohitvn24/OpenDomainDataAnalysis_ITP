		<title>07LONGNOR HALL</title>
		<content> Longnor Hall-which featured in the    
 first{D.S.}has been in the possession 
 of the{Burton}family since l340.In    
 that time the Hall has been rebuilt   
 several times,the latest being an     
 example of{John Nash}work.The estate  
 has a tradition that it can only be   
 handed down intact to each eldest son.
 The estate runs to about 2000 acres,  
 half of which is farmed,the rest let  
 to tenants.The garden contains an     
 interesting tomb.The incumbent Burton 
 at the time of Henry VIII became a    
 Protestant with his king. Under Mary  
 Tudor he refused to become a Catholic 
 and was in danger of death. At the    
 time of her death his sons brought the
 news from S'bury,the shock killed     
 him.Refused an R.C. funeral he was    
 entombed on his own lawn with an      
 appropriate anti-papist slogan!
