    Surveys conducted within Eccleston 
County Primary School's 210 pupils give
some indication of the way-of-life of  
the families from which they come.     
    More than one third have a home    
micro-computer. About one third have a 
video recorder.                        
    Only two children have grandparents
living with them, as part of the       
family. About one quarter live near    
enough to grandparents to visit them   
without adult supervision.             
    About half have two parents at     
work.                                  
    About half have travelled outside  
the British Isles by aeroplane.        
    More than half come from 2-child   
families; only 5% are single children. 
The largest families have five         
children, and only two are represented 
in school.                             </content>
