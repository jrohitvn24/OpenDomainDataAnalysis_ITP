		<content> Newcomers are helping to change the   
 village but she has nothing against   
 them, because they haven't made the   
 village any noisier. She even thought 
 that an extra general store would help
 to provide a better variety of goods. 
 Entertainment is not good in the      
 village and this could be improved she
 thought. There are plenty of pubs     
 which she doesn't mind so long as     
 "people keep themselves to            
 themselves". Mrs. Hoggard also said   
 that she was worried if there was a   
 nuclear war. She was also in favour of
 computers even though some people     
 don't like them. We thought that her  
 greatest fear was that she would soon 
 have to retire from our school as a   
 cook. She said that she loves working 
 with children at the school where     
 she has been for 20 years.
