		<title>03PRE- READING SCHEME.</title>
		<content> Because of the{very isolated and }    
{lonely life}of many pre-school        
 children in this area the school has  
 established a scheme to bring these   
 youngsters together to provide them   
 with an introduction to books and the 
 pleasures of reading along with the   
 social activities of school life.     
   The weekly session begins with the  
{changing of library books}from a      
 selection specifically aimed at this  
 age group.A session of{perceptual}    
{games}follows which are ostensibly fun
 but are structured  to develop visual 
 and auditory powers of memory and     
 discrimination.The session concludes  
 with{action songs}chosen to allow the 
 children to be innovative in both     
 action and making up new verses.      
  {The County Psychological Service}see
 this sheme as being of a great benefit
 to those suffering from loneliness.   </content>
