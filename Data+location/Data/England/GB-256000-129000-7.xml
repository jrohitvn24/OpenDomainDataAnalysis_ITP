		<title>07A TRIP INTO BISHOP'S TAWTON</title>
		<content> On Tuesday my group and I went to     
 visit part of Bishop's Tawton area.   
 The first place we went to was Sentry 
 Lane where we started to fill in our  
 questionnaires. Then we went on to    
 Windy Ash from where we could see most
 of our area and most parts of         
 Barnstaple. On our way back to school 
 we finished eating our apples and     
 because it was a very hot day we had a
 swim in the school swimming pool.
