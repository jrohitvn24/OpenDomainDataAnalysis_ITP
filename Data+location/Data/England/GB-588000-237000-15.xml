   Causton's Hall Farm is owned by the 
Royal Agricultural Benevolent Trust. It
has been farmed by Mr P.Schwind for the
past 12 years. The farm covers 900     
acres of land. Crops such as wheat,    
barley , rape ,sugar beet, beans, and  
peas are grown. In the 1920s the farm  
employed 32 staff with extra during    
harvest time. However, only 5 staff are
employed today due to the increased use
of machinery. The estimated value of   
the farm is 1.8 million pounds, with   
the largest field being worth          
approximately 135,000 pounds. The farm 
has no livestock.                      
   One character who worked on the farm
for 58 years, since he was 14 years    
old, remembers earning 10 shillings a  
week when he began work and that the   
farm had a flock of sheep and several  
pigs.                                  </content>
