		<content>     I go to the Rubery Youth Club     
 which meets at a special building     
 attatched to Waseley Hills High       
 School. The Junior section ( 10 y.o.  
 to 14 y.o.) meet on a Wednesday       
 evening. It costs 75p. to become a    
 member and all members then get       
 membership cards. It will then cost   
 15p.per night to attend for members or
 30p. for non-members.                 
     Activities available include      
 snooker, table tennis and generally   
 having a chat to friends and listen to
 music or watch T.V. all in the Youth  
 Centre. There is also a bar which     
 serves soft drinks and swwets. It is a
 great place to meet people.           
     Also going on inside the Sports   
 Hall of Waseley Hills High School are 
 more energetic activities such as     
 indoor soccer and badminton.({M.
