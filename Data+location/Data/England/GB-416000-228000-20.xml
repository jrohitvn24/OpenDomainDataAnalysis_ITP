		<content> People were asked what they disliked  
 about living in the area &amp; replies    
 were as follows:                      
 Many said they could not fault life in
 the area. Too many rich people who    
 think they own the people as well as  
 the land.New buildings such as the Old
 Orchard development were thought not  
 to be in keeping with the traditional 
 atmosphere of the village.No          
 facilities for young children to play 
 after school.No homes at a price      
 affordable by young couples.Too much  
 gossipping.No gas in the              
 village.Isolation &amp; hazardous         
 pavements in the winter.Few buses &amp;   
 services.Untidy factory areas on the  
 outskirts of the village.Fruit pickers
 causing a nuisance in the summer      
 months.Noise from the music night at  
 the bottom pub.Fox hunting.
