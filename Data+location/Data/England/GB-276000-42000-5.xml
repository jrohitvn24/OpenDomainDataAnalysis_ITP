		<title>05My Home in Frogmore.</title>
		<content> My house has got six rooms. We have   
 got two bedrooms, one bathroom, one   
 kitchen and one lounge. We have got   
 two rooms upstairs and four rooms     
 downstairs. Mummy and daddy have one  
 bedroom and my sister and brother and 
 I share the other.  When I look out of
 the window I see lots of fields. My   
 garden has got apple trees, plum      
 trees and damson trees. We have also  
 got a blackberry bush. We grow lots of
 plants in our garden. We have five    
 sheds. One of our sheds we use for our
 bikes and another as a play shed -    
 once we kept two goats in it and they 
 ate the door off. My dad uses         
 a shed to put his van in, the other   
 two are used for wood for the fire.
