 Farmer Sears explained that the farm  
was over 300 years old and was part of 
Lord Chesham's estate.He farmed 20 beef
cattle(Aberdeen Angus) on 40 acres.He  
has 3 sons to help and had farmed since
1952.It was felt that farming was      
becoming less profitable as too much   
food was being produced.
