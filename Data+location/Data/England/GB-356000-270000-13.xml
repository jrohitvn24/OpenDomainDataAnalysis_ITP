		<content> There are several old farmhouses and  
 barns which also house their quota of 
 wildlife. Stonecrops grow on the      
 walls, lichens on the roofs, and      
 yellow necked mice find shelter in the
 winter. In summer, swallows nest under
 the eaves, long eared and pipistrelle 
 bats frequent old attics, and barn    
 owls build nests in the old           
 buildings.There are grass snakes in   
 the gardens, adders on the rough      
 ground, and nine varieties of         
 butterfly have been seen,including    
 holly blue, wall brown, orange tip,   
 painted lady, and green veined        
 white.It is to be hoped that this     
 wealth of fauna and flora will be     
 conserved for future generations to   
 enjoy. See page 3. ST. Mary's.
