		<content>  There is a membership of 40 adults   
 and 35 juniors.The later meet each    
 Friday evening and enjoy play reading,
 improvisation, breathing exercises    
 etc. They take part in productions and
 produce their own show for parents and
 members. Three major productions are  
 presented each year,each for seven    
 performances. Two are usually full    
 length plays and the third a play for 
 children.(Recent productions have been
 Blithe Spirit by Noel Coward, Table   
 Manners by Alan Ayckborne and         
 Pinocchio). In addition the Christmas 
 and Summer shows are performed for    
 just 2 nights and contain a miscellany
 of music and words. The Society also  
 has an ongoing fund raising campaign  
 and tries to use the theatre as much  
 as possible to enable it to be self   
 supporting and maintain the           
 fabric of the theatre.                </content>
