		<title>18A BANK MANAGER'S DAY AT WORK</title>
		<content> The manager arrives for work at 9 a.m.
 The staff have already arrived.His    
 first job is to look through the      
 morning post.   He will deal with any 
 problems until 9.15.   Next he will   
 look at his computer listings to see  
 which accounts are overdrawn.  Then he
 will see perhaps two customers.       
                                       
   He goes home for dinner at 1 p.m.   
 Only a few bank managers can go home  
 for dinner as most live too far away. 
 After dinner he might go to see one of
 his farmer customers and look around  
 his farm.                             
                                       
   He leaves the bank at about 5 p.m.  
 Most of his paper work is done at home
 instead of at the bank when the staff 
 have gone home.
