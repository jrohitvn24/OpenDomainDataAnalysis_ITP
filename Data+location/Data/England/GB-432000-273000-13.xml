		<content> Radical changes in pattern due to the 
 smaller farms disappearing and loss of
 farmland to housing estates.There are 
 eight farms on the map King's Hill,   
 Hill, Home,Oak, Rock,Stoneleigh Grange
 The Leasowes, and Manor Fields.The    
 first three are no longer farms and   
 are now private dwellings.Home farm is
 an exclusive Mews type group of houses
 The land belonging to the first two   
 farms both of which were worked as    
 tenancies are now farmed directly by  
 the landowners Gregory Hood of        
 Stratford. Home farm land was used in 
 the construction of Coventry          
 airport.Farming is mostly cereals,    
 sown grass, beef cattle and sheep.Rock
 farm is a dairy unit.Oak farm now     
 farms land which after World War 1 was
 set up as smallholdings for returning 
 servicemen.The scheme was not         
 successful.                           </content>
