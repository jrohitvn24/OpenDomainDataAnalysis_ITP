		<title>10HALMEREND YOUTH CLUB</title>
		<content>Halmerend Youth Club is situated in    
High Street,Halmerend about 100 yards  
from the school.                       
The Youth Club building itself is like 
a small house which has 2 large rooms  
and 1 small one with a counter in it.It
is run by Mrs.Hackwood voluntarily but 
there is also a youth club leader to   
help.                                  
The senior youth club is on Tuesday and
Friday night between 8.00 &amp; 10.00pm.   
The average age of the seniors is      
between 15-16.The juniors youth club is
on Thursday between 6.00 &amp; 8.00.The age
of the juniors is 14 and under.        
There are activities in the club such  
as pool and table tennis but many of us
use the club as a way of making new    
friends.We have to give a small amount 
each visit (20p) to go towards electric
used during youth club hours.
