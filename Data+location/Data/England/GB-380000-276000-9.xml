		<title>09K'minster Carpets - Today.</title>
		<content> Kiddermister has been able to retain  
 its prominent position in the textile 
 industry due to the continuing demand 
 for high-quality wool carpets.        
 Kidderminster carpets, mainly Wilton  
 and Axminster, are exported all over  
 the world; most of the larger orders  
 come from the USA and Saudi Arabia.   
 Carpets are often specially made for  
 palaces, large hotels, casinos and    
 airports. About 6250 people (20% of   
 the working population) are employed  
 in the carpet industry, dispersed     
 between the ten large factories and   
 numerous small ones. Between them,    
 every week, 40000 to 100000 sq. m. of 
 carpet is produced, 60-70% of all     
 British carpets. Today carpets are as 
 vital to the town as they have ever   
 been during the last 250 years.
