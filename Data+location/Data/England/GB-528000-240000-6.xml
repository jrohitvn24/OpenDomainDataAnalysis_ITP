		<content>  In Litlington people say if you run  
 around the church,near the bungalows, 
 after 12:00pm seven times,you wil see 
 the devil,but I don't know if it is   
 true.                                 
  Also in Litlington there is a story  
 about a knight on horseback.It began  
 when a window cleaner was cleaning the
 windows and he saw a shadow of a      
 knight and a horse,he told this to a  
 vicar and the vicar went outside and  
 saw nothing.The window cleaner was on 
 his last window and he saw the shadow 
 again.He went out of the church,      
 locking the door behind him and then  
 he saw the knight.The knight chased   
 him he found refuge in the vicar's    
 house because of the cross on the     
 wall.                                 
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
