		<content>  In Saxon times, even before William  
 the Conqueror came to Britain, Bywell 
 had two churches, St. Peters' and     
 St.Andrews'. St. Andrews' was the     
 mother church of this area.           
 On Sundays the people from The Riding 
 and Broomhaugh had to walk to Bywell  
 to the church.                        
 When the railway opened people from   
 Newcastle moved here and they decided 
 they deserved a church of their own.  
 So St. James' church was built in     
 1856. It was quite small at first but 
 then the people decided to enlarge    
 it, so they built two transcepts, one 
 big one for the congregation and a    
 smaller one for the organ.            
 There is also a Methodist Chapel in   
 the village. It was bought from the   
 Baptists in 1966 and was then 123     
 years old, although the graveyard was 
 first used in about 1700 A.D.         </content>
