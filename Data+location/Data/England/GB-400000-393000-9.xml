 gather information about how people   
 use their{freetime.}We arrived at{    
{11am.}and interviewed until{1pm.}     
 During this time people came out of   
 work and many of them came into the   
 square for their lunch. This gave us  
 the{variety}we wanted for our survey. 
 We{interviewed}people of different    
 ages and with different jobs, a{total}
 of 436 people-{142 females,294 males.}
 The most{popular pastime}was watching 
 Tv, but most people enjoyed some      
{active form of recreation.            
 We asked them if they did any of the  
 following: sport(eg. football,squash) 
 watching Tv: Bingo: Do-it-yourself:and
 gardening. We found a large percentage
 played some sport, often in the{
