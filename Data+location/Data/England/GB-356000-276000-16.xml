		<content> round and take your order and when the
 traveller went through the next       
 town he would give the order to the   
 shopkeeper.This would then be         
 delivered by the end of the week.If   
 there was  any meat in the order it   
 would have to be eaten the same day   
 as the shopkeeper delivered, or it    
 would go bad because they had no way  
 of keeping it cool.The second world   
 war changed Bitterley because evacuees
 came from the big cities.Styles of    
 clothes have changed,the boys were not
 allowed to wear short trousers untill 
 they were 13.Mr Baker is now 81 and he
 likes Bitterley a lot.
