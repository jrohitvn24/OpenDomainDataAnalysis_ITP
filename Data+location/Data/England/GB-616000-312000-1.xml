		<title>01DRAYTON AREA , INTRODUCTION</title>
		<content>      The village of{Drayton}lies      
 about 5 miles from the centre of      
 Norwich on  the Fakenham road.        
      A settlement has been on this    
 site for many years,there being       
 evidence of habitation from early     
{Saxon}times.                          
      Drayton was a popular            
 stopping-off point for{Pilgrims}on    
 their way to the shrine at{Walsingham,
{Henry VIII}being one of the many royal
 pilgrims to stay here.                
      The landscape varies from the    
 arable farmland to the North to the   
 Wensum valley in the South.Recently,  
 the area has seen a large{housing     
{expansion}from Norwich,joining the    
 villages of Drayton,Taverham and      
 Hellesdon into one ribbon development.
