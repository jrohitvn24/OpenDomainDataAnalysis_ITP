		<title>13ATTITUDES IN SHALBOURNE</title>
		<content> There is strong support for the local 
{school:}most children attend it or    
 would if appropriate; people are      
 content with the school, feeling it is
 very important to the village.  A very
 high percentage of those asked voted  
 at the last{Parish Council}Election   
 and all thought they would vote next  
 time; most could name nearly half the 
 present Council and had some idea of  
 the topics it deals with; about half  
 feel it does a good but limited job - 
 half are unsure.  Few of those asked  
 attend the local{church}other than on 
 special days, many preferring to spend
 Sundays elsewhere or on other pursuits
 however, all these infrequent worship-
 pers still consider a church + priest 
 vital to a village! All claimed to    
 support/enjoy local events; most liked
{village life}although less so if they 
 had no transport.                     </content>
