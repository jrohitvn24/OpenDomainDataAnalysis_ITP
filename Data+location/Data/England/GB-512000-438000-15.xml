		<content> There are a few old houses in         
 Skirlaugh, about 6% are over 100 years
 old, but most have been built in the  
 last twenty years.                    
 There is no local stone because the   
 whole area is made up of the muddy    
 bottom of an ancient lake, so nearly  
 all the houses are made of bricks.    
 Also there is no slate so the roofing 
 material is tile.                     
 The oldest houses are along the main  
 road and along one street on either   
 side of the cross roads. The new      
 houses are on an estate round the     
 school and further along the two side 
 roads.                                
 We found out the ages of houses in the
 village and worked out a percentage   
 for each age group.                   
 Over 100 yrs   6%    51 to 100    3%  
 21 to 50      26%    11 to  20   36%  
 Under 10 yrs  29%                     </content>
