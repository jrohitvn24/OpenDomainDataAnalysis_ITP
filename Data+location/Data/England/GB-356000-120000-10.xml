		<title>10THE LIFE OF A HOUESWIFE.</title>
		<content> Life in Marston Magna can be very     
 pleasant for a housewife. There are   
 some very attractive and quite new    
 houses with large gardens set back    
 from the main road, making for a      
 peaceful life.The only disturbance    
 being the aeroplanes flying overhead. 
 Although there are no shops in the    
 village this does not appear to cause 
 too many problems as most families own
 a car and travel to Yeovil for food,  
 clothing and any other requirements.  
 After the wives have completed their  
 houeswork there are many hobbies which
 they like to pursue such as gardening,
 sewing, patchwork or jam making.      
 The Woman's Institute is a favourite  
 with many of the ladies as here they  
 can meet their friends and catch up   
 with all the village news, listen to  
 speakers and take part in various     
 competitions.                         </content>
