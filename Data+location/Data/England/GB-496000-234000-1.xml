		<title>01Woburn Safari Park</title>
		<content> The safari park concept came to       
 Britain in the 1960's and one of the  
 first to open was at Woburn. In the   
 1960's, the thought of driving through
 enclosures where wild animals, in     
 particular lions, roamed free, was    
 very new and exciting, contrasting    
 markedly with zoos.                   
                                       
 In the 1970's, large numbers of parks 
 opened throughout the country and the 
 pioneers had to continually find new  
 attractions to attract visitors,      
 especially those who had made a       
 previous visit.                       
                                       
 The result was, in the case of Woburn,
 a funfair, performing seals, cable    
 cars, a miniature railway and a "space
 rider."
