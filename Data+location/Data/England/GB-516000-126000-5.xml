		<title>05The Building Fund</title>
		<content>   For our new part of the{school}we   
 need fifty thousand pounds.We already 
 have eighteen thousand pounds.There   
 already have been some fund raising   
 events.                               
 One of the ideas were{bricks}that we  
 could fill up with coppers and so when
 we fill up the bricks we are given the
 brick back but empty. We had{Americans
 over from Fort Worth,Texas.We had the 
 Sheepdog trial where we raised Â£1000. 
  In the{Horsham Arts Centre}there was 
 a concert and the proceeds went to the
 Building Fund.Meanwhile in Headcorn,  
 Kent two people volunteered to        
{parachute}from a plane to raise money 
 for the Building Fund.The reason why  
 Libby and Athen wanted to attempt this
 was not just because  they wanted to  
 jump it was so they could raise money 
 for the{School Building Fund.
