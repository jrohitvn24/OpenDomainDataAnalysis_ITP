		<content> We interviewed Mr.P.Lewis,at Tower    
 Farm, Lyneal,who runs a mixed farm.   
 That day Mr. Lewis got up at 7.30am.  
 The first thing he does is feed the   
 cattle.Mr. Lewis has to feed those in 
 the sheds every day.                  
 He sprayed the crops and drenched the 
 cattle in the morning. He has to spray
 the cattle for diseases and in the    
 summer has to drench the cattle       
 every 10 days.                        
 He looked at the cattle in the fields 
 then.                                 
 Also in the winter he has to bed the  
 cattle with straw.                    
 The Ministry of Agriculture comes out 
 once a year to check the cattle for   
 T.B.                                  
 Mr. Lewis has to spend alot of time on
 paper work.
