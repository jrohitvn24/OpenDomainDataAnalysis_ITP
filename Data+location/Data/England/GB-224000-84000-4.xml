		<content> The church takes its name from Eglos =
 church, and Keri.(St.Keri was one of  
 26 children of St. Brychan from       
 Wales.) St. Keri also established a   
 chapel between the River Ottery and   
 Kensey. St. Keri's missionary work    
 took place between 500-600 A.D.Until  
 1540 the parish was served by a priest
 from Launceston priory.The Register   
 only began in 1547.The Bishop of      
 Exeter is recorded as consecrating a  
 church at Egloskerry in 1222.Remains  
 of this building may be seen in the   
 blocked up north door,the carving over
 the inside of the south door and the  
 dragon snapping its tail over the     
 outside of the north door.Most of the 
 the church is 15th. century except for
 the north wall,transept,font and      
 piscina which are Norman.The south    
 aisle was added in 1622 by Sir John   
 Speccott of Penheale Manor.(Cont. p.5)</content>
