		<content> THE{COTSWOLD HILLS}FORM A BOUNDARY TO 
 THE EAST OF THE TOWN PROHIBITING      
 FURTHER RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT AND   
 PROVIDING AN AREA OF OPEN SPACE FOR   
 LEISURE. A FEATURE OF THE BLOCK IS THE
 TOWN{CEMETERY AND CREMATORIUM.}THIS   
 SERVES CHELTENHAM AND MUCH OF THE     
 SURROUNDING DISTRICT. MUCH OF THE 20TH
 CENTURY RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT IS    
 FUNCTIONAL AND RATHER PLAIN IN        
 COMPARISON TO THE FINE REGENCY        
 BUILDINGS FOUND IN THE CENTRE OF TOWN.
{SERVICES}IN THE URBAN AREA{ARE        
{DIMINISHING,}WITH FEWER BUSES, THE    
 RECENT CLOSURE AND DEMOLITION OF THE  
 LOCAL SECONDARY SCHOOL, AND THE       
 NEGLECTED AIR OF THE FEATURELESS      
 PLAYING FIELDS WHICH SUGGESTS THAT    
 THE AREA{FACES DECLINE.}YET IT IS     
{SURROUNDED BY}SOME OF ENGLAND'S{MOST  
{BEAUTIFUL AND FAVOURED COUNTRYSIDE.
