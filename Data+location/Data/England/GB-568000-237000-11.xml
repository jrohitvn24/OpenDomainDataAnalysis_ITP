		<title>11EDUCATION IN STAMBOURNE 1</title>
		<content>  There are no schools in Stambourne.  
 The village school closed in 1953.    
 There are about 35 children of        
 school age in the village. Those aged 
 5-11 attend St. Margaret's,           
 Toppesfield, 2-3 miles away. They     
 travel by contract bus; under- sevens 
 living more than 1.5 miles from the   
 school, and under-elevens more than 2 
 miles, can travel free. The school has
 about 60 pupils and 3 teachers.       
 Over-elevens attend Hedingham School, 
 a comprehensive with 1100 pupils and  
 63 teachers. The school is 6 miles    
 away, so all Stambourne's pupils      
 qualify for free transport. Children  
 either take a packed lunch or buy a   
 lunch provided by the school meals    
 service. Some children (eg.from       
 single-parent families) receive free  
 meals.
