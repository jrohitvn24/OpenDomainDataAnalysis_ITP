		<content>{ Haydock}grew because of the mining   
 industry. In 1801 the population was  
 only 734; by 1851 it had increased by 
 272% to 1994, due to the expansion of 
 its mining, under the control of the  
{Evans}family. By the early 1920's the 
 community size was 10333,a 518% growth
 that was to increase only slightly in 
 the next 40 years, with the closing   
 down of the mines.                    
   The{recent}growth in the area has   
 been due mainly to the completion of  
 the{East Lancs Road}and later the     
 advent of a series of major road      
 intersections, M62 and M6,and the     
 establishment of an{industrial estate}
 in the early 1950's bringing much     
 needed firms to the area. The movement
 into the area is reflected by the     
 dramatic growth of 2 new housing      
 estates at Chain Lane and Legh        
 Road since the late 1960's.           </content>
