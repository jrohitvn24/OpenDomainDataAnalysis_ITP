		<title>07Wormleighton - Stoneton</title>
		<content> Stoneton was originally in the parish 
 of Wormleighton, it then became a     
 separate parish but is now back in    
 Wormleighton. Stoneton Manor is next  
 to a field containing the site of an  
 old village but all that remains is   
 the outline in the field. The farmer  
 is not allowed to plough this area and
 uses it for grazing only. The Manor   
 House had a moat but when the present 
 tenants took it the moat was just a   
 marshy area. By permission of the     
 landlord the moat was restored and is 
 now filled with water. This farm is   
 not connected to either water or      
 sewage and obtains its drinking water 
 from the circular wells on land above 
 Wormleighton Manor.
