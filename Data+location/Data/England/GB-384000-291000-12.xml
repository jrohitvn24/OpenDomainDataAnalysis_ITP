 On July 13th 1985, the Ounsdale Garden
Party  (village  fete) was due  to take
place.  However  industrial action   by
teaching unions caused its cancellation
 Despite this  the  village  went ahead
with its own plans to hold a fete.There
would be stalls  run by local clubs and
organisations, behind the Civic Centre,
as well as gymnastic and dance displays
to entertain the public.               
 The highlight of the afternoon was the
procession of decorated floats  through
the village. Much work had been done to
disguise the lorries and vans and their
passengers. They portrayed the theme of
a "Holiday of a Lifetime". The pyramids
of Egypt, the fantasy of Disneyland and
the glamour of Hong  Kong were featured
on floats which were built by villagers
associated with  schools, a dance club,
pubs and certain streets.              </content>
