{Dringhouses is a residential area     
 where many of the houses are provided 
 by York City Council. A number of     
 residents have bought their houses and
 this part of York compares with       
 Woodthorpe in that the residents in   
 Dringhouses tend not to move as much  
 as those in Woodthorpe. There are many
 instances where three generations live
 in the area of Dringhouses.           
{Woodthorpe residents form a changing  
 population. They move from place to   
 place because of their employment with
 British Rail. Many young married      
 people with growing families tend to  
 buy larger houses in the area and so  
 leave room for newly married          
 couples.New houses are being built all
 the time and so more and more people  
 are coming into the Woodthorpe area.  </content>
