		<content>  {Crime}in the area is on the increase
 at the rate of 10 to 12% a year, the  
 main crimes being thefts and          
 burglaries of houses, shops and       
 warehouses. Serious crimes such as    
 murder happen only infrequently,      
 probably about once every two years.  
 The{police}in the area have duties    
 which include patroling the streets to
 help to prevent and detect crime,     
 traffic ofences, attending to domestic
 disputes and sexual assaults and      
 looking for missing persons.          
   Crime detection rate in 1984 was    
 approximately 40%, but was hindered by
 the fact that many police officers    
 were engaged in duties connected with 
 the miners strike.                    
   The neighbourhood policeman, or     
{community constable,}walks around the 
 area and talks to people to find out  
 problems and helps to sort them out.  </content>
