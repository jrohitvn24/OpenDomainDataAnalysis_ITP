		<title>18Policing W.Grove/Denchworth</title>
		<content> W.Grove and Denchworth people are,    
 generally, law abiding. About 20      
 people get taken to the Police Station
 per month, the Station being a small  
 one of 4 cells in Wantage. There is   
 little violence in the area, a small  
 amount of shoplifting, some drunkeness
 and drug taking. But the crime rate   
 reflects the expected behaviour of the
 type of resident found in the area and
 is not great. There are a few traffic 
 problems, driving crimes, teenage     
 problems and personal vendettas and   
 quarrels. Sometimes the police are    
 called to other areas, like Greenham  
 Common near Newbury, where help is    
 needed to control groups like the     
 Peace People whose aim is to persuade 
 the government to outlaw the American 
 atom bomb bases. In the country there 
 is the odd cattle rustling to deal    
 with.                                 </content>
