		<content>     Some widely known games which we  
play are football, rounders, slaps,    
conkers, hop-scotch, tig (off ground,  
40 40), bull-dog, skipping and cat &amp;   
mouse.   We also play the following    
games:                                 
Piranhas:  players jump from raised    
object to object.   If they touch the  
ground they are out.                   
Mother May I:  a kind of "Simon Says". 
Polo:  a category of things is given to
the players by one player who stands at
the other end of the "track" facing    
them.   The players give one example of
this category each.   The player who is
"it" and the person whose item has been
shouted race to opposite ends of the   
track and shout "Polo" when they       
finish.                                
     Other games we play are:
