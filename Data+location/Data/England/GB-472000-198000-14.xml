We went to Bakers' Piece House which   
are flats for elderly people. We met   
Mrs Davis who is eighty four years     
old. When she was a little girl she    
came to Aston Rowant School. Mrs Green 
was the head teacher. She used to      
smack the children. There was a room   
for big children and one for the small 
ones. They did a lot of sewing,        
particularly samplers. Mrs Davis still 
has some that she did in 1910 to 1913. 
They also did arithmetic and writing.  
They never did ay PE or games because  
there was not enough room. If the      
children wanted a drink of water they  
ha go to a house further down School   
Lane. Mrs Davis had to walk about three
miles to school every day. All the     
children in the school were aged from 7
to 13. The younger children went to the
Infant School which was in Kingston.   </content>
