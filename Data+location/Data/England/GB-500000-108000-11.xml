		<title>11SOUTH STOKE IN THE ARUN GAP</title>
		<content> South Stoke, a farming village        
 North-east of Arundel, is approached  
 along a two mile cul-de-sac road. It  
 is surrounded on three sides by the   
 Arun, where the wet-lands provide     
 grazing for cattle. South of the      
 village the higher ground provides for
 arable crops. This farm is one of a   
 four-some run by a tenant farmer. A   
 few cottages, the old rectory and the 
 candle-lit church form the community. 
 Deciduous trees line the lanes and    
 fields. The sheep summer in Wales,    
 transported by truck - 360 per truck. 
 They return in October to graze the   
 unburnt stubble and turnip strips.Sep-
 tic tanks provide sanitation, there is
 no gas. Wood and coal heat the homes. 
 Milk and papers are collected from two
 miles distance. The only child is     
 taxied to school. Only the dustcart   
 calls. It is beautiful and remote.    </content>
