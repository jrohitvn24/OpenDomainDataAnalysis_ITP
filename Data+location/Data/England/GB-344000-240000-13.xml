		<content> The soil is derived mainly from Old   
 Red Sandstone overlain by glacial     
 drift deposits.There is a ridge of    
 terminal moraine parallel to the River
 Wye and matched by a similar ridge on 
 the S bank. Most soils are deep       
 fertile red marls, with patches of    
 more gravelly strata and some gley    
 soils. The area is mainly             
 agricultural, the deep soils growing  
 heavy crops of corn and grass. Fields 
 are generally small and bounded by    
 hedges, but in recent years some      
 hedges have been grubbed out by       
 farmers for easier working by tractor.
 The climate is equable and mean annual
 rainfall is 28ins(5400mm). Winter     
 conditions are usually open but an    
 occasional severe season such as 1982 
 with deep snowfall and hard frost     
 causes damage to plant and animal     
 life. Pollution is not a problem here.</content>
