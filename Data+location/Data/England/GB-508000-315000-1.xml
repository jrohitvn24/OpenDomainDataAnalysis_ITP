		<title>01GENERAL DESCRIPTION</title>
		<content> The main industry is arable farming.  
 The A15 road runs through the area    
 from north to south.To the east of    
 the A15 is Fen  land.The land rises to
 the west, the highest point being     
 Swallow Hill.The centre of population 
 is in Thurlby and Northorpe,population
 1450,which to a visitor would appear  
 as one village.St Firmins Church      
 standing on the bank of Car Dyke is   
 the  oldest building in the area.This 
 is on the east of the A15.The main    
 housing development is on the west of 
 the A15.Very few people are employed  
 within the farming industry.Thurlby   
 and Northorpe since the 1960's have   
 developed as a residential area for   
 the surrounding district.Employment is
 found in Bourne,Stamford and Spalding,
 but the majority of people travel to  
 Peterborough,16miles to the south.Some
 even travel to London by train.       </content>
