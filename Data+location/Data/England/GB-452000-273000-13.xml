		<title>13The Clifton Brook</title>
		<content>    The Clifton Brook is a long, fairly
 wide stretch of water,sometimes deep  
 and at other points very shallow. It  
 runs mainly through wild,waste ground,
 and has for inhabitants numerous      
 specimens of water wildlife. Men have 
 considerably spoiled the stream, both 
 for the creatures and where general   
 appearance is concerned, by polluting 
 it with oil waste and dumping rubbish 
 (as people do with any such brook).   
 Now car tyres, metal scraps, bricks,  
 tins etc. abound in any part of the   
 stream.                               
    At one point in the stream we      
 observed the creation of rapids;a part
 of the brook which flows much faster  
 and is rougher than the water to its  
 immediate right or left.The deep water
 meets a shallow area and its own      
 pressure causes it to flow very       
 quickly over and around the stones.   </content>
