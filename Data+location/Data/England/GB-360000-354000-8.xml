 Canals provide boating facilities for 
 pleasure craft both private and for   
 hire.There are two canal-side Inns -  
 The Barbridge Inn and The Jolly Tar,  
 both having restaurant facilities.    
 There are children's play areas at    
 both these hostelries.The canal banks 
 are favourite haunts of coarse fisher-
 men, fishing matches are frequently   
 arranged by local angling clubs.      
 Gardening is a much enjoyed pastime,  
 most properties having attractive     
 flower gardens, many also growing     
 vegetables.The Cheshire Hounds hunt   
 here with many followers on horseback 
 and in cars.This is also the hunting  
 ground of the Cheshire Beagles whose  
 followers are on foot.Walkers use the 
 many footpaths which cross this       
 peaceful Cheshire countryside.
