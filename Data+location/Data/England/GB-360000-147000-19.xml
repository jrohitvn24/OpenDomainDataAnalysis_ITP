		<content> Large areas of our fields are left as 
 natural meadows with a few small areas
 of woodland. Trees around fields and  
 lanes are Ash and Sycamore with Oak   
 and other trees in plantations or old 
 woods. Hedges are of Hawthorn, Hazel  
 and Holly. Animals found in the area  
 are Roe deer, foxes, badgers, hares   
 and all the usual small mammals. There
 is a full range of wild birds from a  
 wren to a buzzard. Large areas of     
 derelict quarry allow many butterflies
 to breed like Marbled Whites and Small
 Blues. A wide variety of wild flowers 
 are to be found in the hedgerows,     
 fields and walls including Early      
 Purple Orchids, Ragged Robin,         
 Scabious, Violets, Oxlip, Primrose,   
 many wild herbs, Stitchwort, Shining  
 Cranesbill, Rough Hawksbeard, St.Johns
 Wort, beds of wild strawberries,      
 Speedwell and Herb Robert.            </content>
