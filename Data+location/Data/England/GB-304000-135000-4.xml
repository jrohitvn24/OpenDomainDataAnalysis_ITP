		<content>     The tower of this Church is       
 readily seen from the Village.   It is
 a very plain tower which suggests that
 it is of Norman origin.   The bells   
 are interesting.  The treble was given
 by George Notley and has an           
 inscription on it "My treble voice    
 makes hearts rejoice".   Another bell 
 was made about 1543.                  
     As you enter the Church via a fine
 large porch it can be seen  that the  
 Chancel arch is out of line.   Tkhere 
 are various theories to explain this..
     The 13th Century roof is one of   
 the best features of the Church.   It 
 is a waggon roof.   There are many    
 similar in West Somerset - but this is
 a particularly fine example.          
     There are some excellent examples 
 of woodcarving.   The Jacobean screen 
 and the bench  ends and 16th Century  
 being all very interesting.           </content>
