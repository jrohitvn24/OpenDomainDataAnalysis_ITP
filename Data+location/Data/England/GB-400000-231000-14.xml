		<content>     We asked people where they worked 
 and how far they had to travel to work
 if they were not employed locally.    
     The majority of people interviewed
 were retired. Of those of working age 
 thirteen worked outside the village - 
 eleven in Cheltenham and two in       
 Gloucester. The furthest distance     
 travelled to work was eighteen miles. 
 Only two people interviewed worked    
 locally and one of these was the      
 village sub-postmaster.               
     The other people interviewed who  
 were not working classed themselves as
 housewives and only one person stated 
 he was unemployed. This reflects the  
 relatively low level of unemployment  
 in the area.                          
     Our results also reflect that     
 there is little local employment - at 
 least of a status which enables people
 to afford houses in the village.      </content>
