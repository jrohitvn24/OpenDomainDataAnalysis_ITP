		<title>18ATTITUDES: SCHOOL DINNERS</title>
		<content> I like school dinners because they are
 good.  You can have puddings after    
 them.  I don't pay for school dinners 
 because my dad is out of a job.  Three
 quarters of the children do not pay.  
 Only twelve children out of a hundred 
 and twelve in the school go home for  
 dinner.  My favourite school dinner is
 fish and chips and my favourite       
 pudding is rice pudding and sultanas. 
 I have seconds of fish and chips.     
 Some people don't want their food so  
 they give it to the others who are on 
 our table.  I like meringues too.  I  
 like the cream inside the meringues.  
 I like soup.  It is good soup.  We    
 used to have bread rolls for our soup 
 but we don't now.  I don't like pack  
 lunch.  Mummy has not got a job       
 either so I don't pay.                
            (by a ten year old boy).
