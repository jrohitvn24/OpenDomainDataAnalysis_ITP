		<content> I rather like living in a guest house 
 because you get to know people and    
 make friends. It's rather sad when all
 of a sudden they've got to go.        
 Sometimes I get rather jealous; when I
 take in their breakfasts, I would     
 rather eat them all.                  
 In the summer we move into the back   
 next to the kitchen and my sister and 
 I sleep in bunk beds. Altogether we   
 can take 16 people as we've got 6     
 rooms. In the winter we close and have
 our own rooms back upstairs.          
 The only trouble with having a guest  
 house is that mum and dad don't have  
 much time for me, but they do make it 
 up to us in the winter.               
 Our guest house is called Treander and
 we don't do evening meals, just bed   
 and breakfast.
