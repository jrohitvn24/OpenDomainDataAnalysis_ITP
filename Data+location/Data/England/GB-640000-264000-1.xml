		<content> About three quarters of the area is   
 arable land and the rest equally      
 divided between grass for pasture and 
 woodland, largely deciduous. There are
 11 large farms and a few smaller ones,
 whilst some farmhouses are just used  
 as residences. Cottages are used by   
 farmworkers, or as holiday homes; some
 are let to Americans working at the   
 Bentwaters Airbase, or are homes of   
 retired persons. Two areas are more   
 populated: East Green, with 19        
 dwellings, 6 being small farms. Here  
 are 37 adults and 15 children. The    
 second such area is Theberton         
 village, with an electoral roll of    
 203, a thatched church, an inn, no    
 shop but post office facilities in a  
 private house, and most residents work
 in the small town of Leiston, about 3 
 miles away.
