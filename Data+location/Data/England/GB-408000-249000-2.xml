		<content> The population numbers approximately  
 six hundred people and is mainly      
 concentrated around North and Middle  
 Littleton. There is a mixture of old  
 and new housing, a wide variety       
 ranging from terraced cottages to     
 larger farm houses. Approximately     
 forty new houses have been built in   
 the last twenty years. Cottages which 
 were several hundred years old and    
 allowed to fall into disrepair have   
 been modernised and extended. In the  
 main these properties have been       
 purchased by people moving into the   
 area who work in the nearby towns.
