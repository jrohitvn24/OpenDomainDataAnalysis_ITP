		<title>04   A MAYORAL VIEW-MRS.RILEY.</title>
		<content>Mrs Riley moved to Shiremoor when she  
got married and at that time the house 
where she lives now was surrounded by  
fields and fields.Now her only relative
left in the area is a nephew but Mrs   
Riley would not like to leave the area 
she has served for many years.         
Mrs Riley likes Shiremoor and has been 
a governor of our middle school since  
1954.She likes the people and she would
not like to see the area changed too   
much but she would like to see better  
shopping facilities and especially a   
new sports complex for the young       
people  of the area.We now have three  
nurseries and one toddler group plus   
three areas of sheltered housing for   
the elderly.Mrs Riley was mayoress from
1977-79 and again in 1984-5,her year   
ended on 9th of May.
