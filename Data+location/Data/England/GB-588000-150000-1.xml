		<content>  The two top classes of Lenham County 
 Primary School have taken part in the 
 Domesday Project. There were 60       
 children involved so we divided into  
 12 groups, each of 5 children         
 accompained by a teacher or parent,&amp;  
 set out to survey our 12 square       
 kilometre blocks. We looked for       
 changes, we mapped out areas &amp; we took
 photographs. We made a second visit to
 places of particular interest; the    
 sewerage works, the Fire Station, the 
 Police Station, Lenham Storage etc.   
  We made up a questionnaire, which was
 filled out by 200 householders, &amp; we  
 talked to residents. Then we put      
 together all the information &amp; wrote  
 our sheets. We had to leave a lot out.
  We enjoyed the work &amp; we hope the    
 result will be useful.                
  We found everyone very helpful &amp;     
 kind. Lenham is a friendly place.     </content>
