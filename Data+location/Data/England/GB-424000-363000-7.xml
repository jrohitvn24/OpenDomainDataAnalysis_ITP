   Rowsley used to have a railway      
 station,situated to the east of       
 Rowsley Bridge. The station was       
 converted to Rowsley Garage (now      
 derelict) when the railway was        
 demolished in 1968.                   
   Next door to the old station there  
 used to be an Express Dairy Milk      
 terminal, now used by Bakewell        
 Potteries. The potteries sell all     
 their products in nearby shops.       
  The festival each June includes well 
 dressing. The now disused wells are   
 intricately decorated with flowers    
 petals and a memrial service held at  
 each.The festival also includes       
 considerable display of local crafts  
 and talents. The is a parade and      
 Morris dancing, and maypole dancing,  
 and exhibition of Childrens work.
