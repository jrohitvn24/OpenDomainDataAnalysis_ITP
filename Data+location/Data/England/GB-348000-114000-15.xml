		<content>{(cont. from p.13)}1 sledge to go      
 behind a bail maker,  tractor loader  
 which does allsorts of things,corn    
 drill, 1 plough, lots of harrows,a    
 fertiliser,and a dung spreader.One boy
 had an accident on a tractor ,where it
 rolled on him,and he died.Animals are 
 sold for about 3 or 400 pounds a      
 ton.Barley is a little less money that
 wheat.John Marsh owned Pye Corner Farm
 when it was an inn.The types of cows  
 are Hereford,Hereford cross Fresian,  
 Aberdeen Angus, Charolais cross       
 Fresian, Devon, Fresian and Chianina. 
 The soil around is very sandy and this
 means it is weedy.Last year was very  
 good for the farm because of the sun. 
 The grain was smaller but heavier.    
 Â£2000000 of grain went to Africa.Mrs  
 Hodder herself inspects the cattle and
 corn and looks for diseases.In her    
 spare time she makes corn dollys.     </content>
