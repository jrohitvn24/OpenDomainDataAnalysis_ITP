		<title>11Farming around Crowhurst.</title>
		<content> About{two thirds}of our area is rural 
 either{woodland or mixed farming}land.
 The woodland is nearly all{deciduous  
 and covers a lot of land, particularly
 in the N.E. at Beauport Wood.         
 It includes an area of Special        
 Scientific Interest (plants, bird and 
 insect life), which they are hoping to
 make bigger, at Marline Wood.         
 There are about 12 farms in our area, 
 with names like Park Farm, Stonebridge
 Farm and Breadsell Farm. Although it  
 is mixed farming most of the land is  
 used for{cattle grazing.}There are    
 some sheep too. Most of the cattle are
 Friesian. The farmers have quite large
 herds, giving plenty of milk.         
 Some crops are grown on this clay     
 soil.There is a Nursery at High Beech.
 Recently farmland has been lost as the
 land is used for housing, factories   
 and road development.                 </content>
