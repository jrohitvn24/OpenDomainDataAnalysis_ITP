		<title>06CALOW C.E.JUNIOR SCHOOL</title>
		<content> Calow Junior School is still a        
 Church of England Controlled School.  
 The church is St.Peters.The old school
 was built across the road from the    
 church because the Vicar was the Head.
 The Rector comes into school every    
 week and takes Assembly.He then spends
 about an hour talking to one class.We 
 visit the church on special occasions.
 We have our Carol Service there and   
 some of us go to the Christingle      
 Service,which is in aid of the Church 
 of England Childrens Society.         
 Just before Easter two ladies from the
 church come into school and we help to
 make the Palm Crosses for the Palm    
 Sunday Services.We have a special Palm
 Cross Service too                     
 The Rector visits school at other     
 times and we visit the church too.
