		<title>19ST.JOHN SOUTHWORTH 1592-1654</title>
		<content>John was ordained in France and then   
spent most of his working life amongst 
the poor families in plague-stricken   
London. He served several prison       
sentences because he was an R.C. priest
and was finally arrested in 1654.      
At his trial he pleaded not guilty to  
treason, but confessed priesthood.The  
judges found him guilty, but did their 
best to save his life, trying in vain  
for many hours to persuade him to      
change his plea. Reluctantly they were 
compelled to condemn him to death.John 
thanked the Court for their exceptional
and admirable kindness and the magi-   
trate was so upset that he had         
difficulty pronouncing the sentence    
His execution was dramatic, taking     
place in a violent thunderstorm.He was 
the last priest to be martyred in Eng- 
and and his body is now in Westminster 
Cathedral. He was canonized in 1970.   </content>
