		<title>11Youth Activities in Weston</title>
		<content> There are several clubs in Weston for 
 young people.  For the very young     
 there is the{Play Group}which meets   
 weekly and provides toys and craft    
 activities for some 20 children aged  
 from birth to 5 years.  For older     
 children the{Youth Club}has recently  
 been reformed and has 14 members aged 
 between 8 and 15 years who meet fort- 
 nightly for table tennis, quizzes etc.
                                       
 The Girl Guide Movement is well       
 supported in the Village.  Some 18    
{Brownies}and 30{Guides}meet weekly to 
 undertake outdoor and handicraft      
 activities.  The Guides also go       
 camping regularly.  The{Ranger Guide  
 unit meets fortnightly.  Most of its  
 12 members are Queen's Guides and all 
 are working on the Duke of Edinburgh's
 Award Scheme. The Rangers enjoy hiking
 camping and fundraising for charity.  </content>
