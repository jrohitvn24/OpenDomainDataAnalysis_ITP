		<content> The refuse vehicle collects the       
 household waste once a week on        
 Tuesday. It is taken to the dump at   
 Bunny Lane, Romsey, grid ref 358248.  
 Fewer farm vehicles pass along the    
 road to E.Dean because the farmer has 
 built his own road to connect his     
 farmland without the danger of the    
 level crossing at grid ref. 280267.   
 We have a bus service which passes    
 through the village regularly 3 or 4  
 times a day. Most people travel by car
 to Romsey or by bicycle around the    
 village. There are two garages where  
 you can have your car serviced and    
 repaired. They both sell petrol.      
 The railway line goes through the     
 village but the station is at         
 Dunbridge, grid ref. 318262.
