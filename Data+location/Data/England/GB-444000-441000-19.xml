		<title>19Market Days</title>
		<content> For some time now, Tadcaster has      
 supported two{markets,}one of which is
 held on a Tuesday. This one is called 
 the mini-market and it takes place in 
 the Riley-Smith Hall all day. The     
 things sold vary from clothes to      
 cakes. There are not many stalls but  
 they do make money. On Thursdays in   
 the main car park is another market.  
 This one has far more stalls, about 20
 to 25 in all and they sell clothes,   
 shoes, cakes and bread, and fruit and 
 vegetables.{Prices}are very reasonable
 causing much aggrevation to the local{
{shop}owners as they tend to lose{     
{trade.}The markets are ideal for old  
 age pensioners who  go down and get   
 their groceries when they are unable  
 to get into York or Leeds.            
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
