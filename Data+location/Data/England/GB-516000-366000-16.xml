		<content> Mrs Wilkinson closes the shop for half
 a day on Tuesday and Saturday and is  
 closed all day on Sunday because it is
 illegal to  open on that day. The     
 building is 85 years old because it   
 was built in 1900 along side Century  
 House which is how it gets its name.  
                                       
 Mrs Wilkinson has one delivery from   
 the wholesalers every week.           
                                       
 The Post Office part of the shop deals
 in stamps, postal orders, letters,    
 parcels, overseas letters, National   
 Insurance Stamps, National Savings    
 Bank, Gift vouchers, Government
