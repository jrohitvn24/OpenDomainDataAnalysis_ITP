		<title>18Employment in Much Marcle</title>
		<content>  I asked a lady who has lived in Much 
 Marcle for fifty years where the      
 villagers used to work.She said that  
 nearly everyone was employed in       
 agriculture or at westons cider       
 factory,and hardly anyone left the    
 village to work.Today some of our     
 parents still work at westons or in   
 farming.However many travel by car to 
 near by towns.One or two travelled    
 far away to work.Cathys father travels
 all the way to Aylesbury and she only 
 sees him at weekends.Soon Cathys      
 family will move away from the village
 to be close to her fathers work.Quite 
 a lot of parents are now starting     
 their own businesses at home and are  
 self employed. It is very difficult   
 for the young school leavers to find  
 any work in Much Marcle and they have 
 to leave the village.
