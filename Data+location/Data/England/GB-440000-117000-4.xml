		<title>04MOTORWAYS _ GENERAL</title>
		<content> MOTORWAYS ARE MAJOR ROUTEWAYS, USUALLY
 COMPRISING TWO OR THREE LANES WITH A  
 HARD SHOULDER. THE TIME/DISTANCE ALONG
 THESE ROADS IS MUCH LESS OWING TO THE 
 HIGHER SPEED LIMIT AND STRAIGHTER     
 ROADS. MOTORWAYS ARE ESSENTIAL TO THE 
 NECESSARY FAST COMMUNICATIONS OF TODAY
 BECAUSE OF INCREASING PRIVATE CAR     
 OWNERSHIP AND INCREASED TRANSPORTATION
 OF MANUFACTURED GOODS BY ROAD.        
 MOTORWAYS OCCUPY OFTEN VALUABLE FARM  
 LAND AND RESIDENTIAL AREAS AND HAVE   
 BEEN A MAJOR CAUSE FOR CONTROVERSY    
 THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY.               
 CONSERVATIONISTS ARE NEARLY ALWAYS    
 PRESENT WHEN SURVEYS ARE BEING CARRIED
 OUT. ADMITTEDLY,THESE LINKWAYS ARE NOT
 VERY ATTRACTIVE;THEIR HUGE CONCRETE   
 BRIDGES,FLY_OVERS,HIGH EMBANKMENTS AND
 POLLUTION OF THE SURROUNDING AREA ARE 
 ALL VERY TYPICAL.
