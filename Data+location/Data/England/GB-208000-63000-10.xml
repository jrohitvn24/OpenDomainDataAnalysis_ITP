		<title>10PENDEWY FARM - BODMIN</title>
		<content> The farm is Dad's farm and Dad,       
 Grandad, Ray Banks (a hired man who   
 does the milking) and Roger Sandoe    
 (another hired man who does general   
 farm work) are silage making at the{ }
 moment.{Silage }is grass that has     
 been left to grow until is a good     
 length.  Then it is cut and treated   
 with a chemical called{Silade.}It is  
 left under plastic sheets until it is 
 needed for winter feeding to the cows.
 We have about 200 cows.  We used to   
 milk them three times a day but our   
 milk   quota has been reduced so we   
 now milk twice  day.  We breed the    
 Pendewy herd of pure{Holstein}and     
{Friesan cows.}We keep the heifer      
 calves for replacement stock and sell 
 the bull calves at market.
