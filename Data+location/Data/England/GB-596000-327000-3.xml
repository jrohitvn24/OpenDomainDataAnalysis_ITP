 Some of the land at the eastern edge  
 of the survey area belongs to the     
{Sennowe Park Estate,}formerly owned by
 Sir Thomas Cook, and now farmed by his
 son - also Thomas. Crops grown are    
 similar to those at{Ashworth's farm   
 (See page 2), plus sugar beet.  Mr.   
 Cook has dairy cattle too (Friesians),
 and a small herd of beef cattle       
 (Hereford), and 300 to 400 sheep,     
 producing about 500 lambs a year.     
 The sheep are dipped to prevent sheep 
 scab each July and September, and     
 sheared in May or June.  The fleeces  
 are sold to the Wool Board.           
 The area has much woodland, made up of
 mixed species (deciduous and conifer) 
 at different ages, this form of       
 continuous rotation being most        
 productive.
