		<title>03CLAY EXTRACTION-WATER SUPPLY</title>
		<content> The company of English China Clays    
 Limited has three pits in the Lee Moor
 area.The china clay is obtained by    
 breaking up the surface with high     
 pressure water hoses,which force water
 out at over 250 p.s.i.About 1,800     
 gallons are used every minute.Part of 
 the water comes from the river Plym   
 and the rest is recycled from the     
 processing plant.As this goes on 24   
 hours a day,7 days a week it means    
 they use about eighteen million       
 gallons every week.The hoses are      
 remote-controlled and the force of    
 water is so strong it washes out the  
 sand and mica,as well as the china    
 clay.The water from the river Plym is 
 piped to the china clay pits but      
 fortunately it is gravity fed and does
 not need to be pumped.Water is vital  
 for the extraction of china clay at   
 Lee Moor.                             </content>
