		<title>12HANDICAPPED UNIT, THATCHAM.</title>
		<content> The handicapped unit at Kennet        
 Secondary school houses children from 
 12 to 18 years old. It was opened in  
 September 1985 for pupils who are     
 physically  handicapped and currently 
 houses fourteen pupils with a variety 
 of disabilities.                      
 The unit is like a home at playtimes  
 for the disabled pupils. Most do      
 normal lessons but not games.         
 The unit also has its own Headmaster  
 along with a welfare assistant and a  
 physiotherapist. She has her own room 
 away from the unit in the sports hall 
 complex. In the physiotherapy room the
 pupils spend up to 40 minutes having  
 treatment. In that time they may try  
 to balance on a ball, pedal an        
 exercise bicycle and many other things
 to keep them fit. Although these boys 
 and girls are disabled they are always
 happy and cheerful.                   </content>
