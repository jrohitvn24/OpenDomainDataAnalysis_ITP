		<title>04History of Filey Fishing.</title>
		<content> In 1897 400 men earned their living   
 from the sea and lots of families     
 helped.Wives and daughters gathered   
 bait on the beach towards Cayton Bay  
 for "flithers"(limpets)Inthe late     
 1930's the number of cobles had       
 dropped to below 40, and in 1953,there
 were only 10.There has been a revival 
 in recent years and youngsters have   
 come back to the boats.In 1977 there  
 were around 50 men employed in the    
 fishing industry.There were 14,3 man  
 cobles and 3,2 man boats.Launching    
 and landing a boat at Filey is        
 difficult because there is no         
 harbour,a tractor has to pull the     
 boats in and out of the sea.
