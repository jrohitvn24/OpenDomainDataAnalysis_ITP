 several garden centres and many plants
 are acpuired from this source.        
{GARDEN PLANTS:NORTH NORFOLK COAST     
 Considering the area is very exposed, 
 it is surprising the number of unusual
 and somewhat exotic plants cultivated.
 We saw many varieties of lily, shrubs 
 such as Ceanothus,Camellia,Pieris and 
 Fremontia as well as  many of the more
 ordinary garden flowers.We also saw   
 Crinum,Schitzostylis,and Nerine all   
 relatively tender,being grown in areas
 sheltered from the wind.No doubt if   
 the gardner can provide a suitable    
 windbreak he can take advantage of the
 comparative lack of frost.Many gardens
 make a valuable contribution to the   
 family budget,providing potatoes,peas,
 beans and cabbage and in some cases,  
 tomatoes, cucumbers and peppers from  
 the greenhouse.                       </content>
