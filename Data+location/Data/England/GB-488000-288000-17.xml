		<title>17Housing in Corby.</title>
		<content>There is a wide variety of housing     
available in Corby, most of which has  
been built since 1945. Many of the     
modern estates won housing awards      
during their construction although now 
some are in need of considerable       
renovation and a great deal of money is
having to be spent to bring them to a  
standard suitable for habitation.      
Prices in the area are considerably    
lower than the national average, even  
at the top end of the market and many  
surrounding villages have developed    
small private housing estates to cater 
for the executives moving to the town  
with new industries.                   
Corby District Council operates a key  
worker policy which allows companies to
nominate a number of workers for rented
housing. Many council houses have been 
purchased and are being refurbished so 
private houses are well distributed.   </content>
