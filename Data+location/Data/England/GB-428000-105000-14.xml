		<title>14The Use of The Forest</title>
		<content> The forest in our area is one of      
 outstanding natural beauty and there  
 are many demands made upon it by the  
 farmer and tourist.                   
 Part of the forest is used for grazing
 by New Forest ponies and the area     
 around Hursthill Inclosure is         
 designated a Nature Reserve.          
 There is public access to the forest  
 at Gritnam Wood, Clayhill Heath and   
 Whitley Wood off the Brockenhurst     
 Road.   At these sites there are car  
 parking facilities, picnic sites and  
 many miles of paths and trails for    
 people to enjoy the natural, peaceful 
 surroundings.   Dogs are forbidden at 
 most of these sites.   The public are 
 reminded to take their litter home.   
 Guided walks through the forest are   
 organized by The Forestry Commission  
 and leave Lyndhurst on selected dates 
 in summer months, price 25 pence.     </content>
