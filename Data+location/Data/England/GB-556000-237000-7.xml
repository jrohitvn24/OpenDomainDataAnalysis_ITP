		<title>07Fields of Barley and Wheat</title>
		<content> Our square is mainly fields.There is  
 barley,wheat and rape.When we visited 
 our square we saw a {red deer}in a    
 rape field.The majority of trees are  
 deciduous but we also saw a  lot of   
 conifers.Most of the deciduous trees  
 are oak and maple.There are two       
 thatched cottages that are over two   
 hundred years old.{Stocking Green     
{ Farm}was built in the 17th           
 Century.All the houses in this area   
 have fairly large gardens.Most gardens
 have a lot of trees.Nearly every house
 in this area has at least one dog.All 
 the people we met enjoy living there  
 except for a man who lives on Stocking
 Green Farm.He doesn't like it in the  
 winter because he is very confined.
