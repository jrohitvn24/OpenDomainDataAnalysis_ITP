		<content> Sark has many buildings,some of which 
 have been standing for years.Most of  
 the houses are built from stone,wood  
 or asbestos.                          
 To build a house on Sark you need     
 permission from the landowner,then the
 Amenities Committee decides whether or
 not you can build.One of the most     
 important things that you have to     
 prove is that you have lived on Sark  
 for fifteen years.Also your house must
 not be seen from the road or sea and  
 it must not be over 30ft high.        
 Some buildings are two storeys high   
 and are usually owned by retired      
 English people who enjoy the peace and
 quiet of the Island or by locals who  
 let out part as self-contained flats  
 to summer visitors.
