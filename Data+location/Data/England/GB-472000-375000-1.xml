		<content> The area surrounding Upton, Headon and
 Askham is predominantly used for      
 farming. Many farms punctuate the     
 landscape, all of them concentrating  
 on either cereal crops, root crops or 
 grass land and some dairy, sheep and  
 pig farming being practised. Hens are 
 also kept.                            
  The land lies between 30 and 40      
 metres above sea level. It originates 
 from old woodland and traces of these 
 can be seen spotted around. Recently  
 the two largest woods namely those of 
 Gamston and Eaton have been purchased 
 by the Nottinghamshire Trust for      
 Nature Conservation.                  
  Another recent development is the    
 preparation for electrification of the
 railway through the block.            
  Recently imposed quotas from central 
 government are the largest concern    
 for local farmers at this time.       </content>
