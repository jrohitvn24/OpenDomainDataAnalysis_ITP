		<title>09The Life Of A Busy Farmer</title>
		<content> Mr Clark inherited his farm from his  
 father in 1984.He doesn't own all the 
 hundred acres, some of it belongs to  
 his Mum, but he has been managing the 
 farm now for 15 years.                
    There are no arable fields,this is 
 a dairy farm with 50 cows and a few   
 beef cattle. Mr Clark milks his dairy 
 herd twice a day which takes up at    
 least eight hours.                    
    The rest of the day is spent in    
 tending or feeding the animals, and   
 seeing to the land and fencing. In    
 summer he must make hay and silage for
 winter feed.                          
    Mr Clark has no spare time in the  
 day usually for he runs the farm by   
 himself except for an odd casual      
 worker to help with the silaging.     
    Although he is always busy, Mr     
 Clark enjoys the life of a farmer.
