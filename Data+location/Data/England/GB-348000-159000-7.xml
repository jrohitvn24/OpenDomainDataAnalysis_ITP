		<content>    THE HOUSES NEAR THE MENDIP HILLS   
 ARE BUILT MOSTLY FROM{LIMESTONE.}THIS 
 HAS BEEN QUARRIED FROM THE HILLS FOR  
 MANY YEARS. LIMESTONE IS STILL        
 QUARRIED ALTHOUGH NOT AS MUCH AS IT   
 USED TO BE.THE HOUSES ARE MOSTLY      
 COVERED WITH RED TILES ALTHOUGH A FEW 
 ARE TILED WITH SLATE WHICH WAS MINED  
 IN{DORSET.                            
    THE MAJORITY OF THE HOUSES WERE    
 BUILT IN THE{VICTORIAN}ERA.IN THE     
 BIGGER VILLAGES SOME OF THE HOUSES ARE
 MADE FROM RED BRICKS AND THEN UPDATED 
 WITH RENDERING .ONE OR TWO HOUSES     
 SITUATED IN THE MENDIP WOODS ARE      
 CONSTRUCTED ALMOST ENTIRELY FROM WOOD.
    THE WALLS OF HOUSES IN THIS AREA   
 VARY IN THICKNESS FROM 0.15 METRES UP 
 TO 1 METRE. A FEW OF THE OLDER HOUSES 
 HAVE BLACK STAINED BEAMS USED IN THEIR
 CONSTRUCTION. AS WELL AS HOLDING THE  
 ROOF UP THEY ARE A STRIKING FEATURE.  </content>
