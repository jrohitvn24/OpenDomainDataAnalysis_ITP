		<title>17Farming in Low Lorton</title>
		<content> On the outskirts of the Lake DISTRICT 
 the farms have a mixture of level, low
 lying ground with a varying proportion
 of hill/fell land. The farms carry    
 mixed livestock dairy or beef cattle  
 with sheep. The land is used for      
 either grazing or the production of   
 sileage and hay for winter feed. 5 of 
 the farms have dairy herds, 2 with 20 
 cows, 3 with 70/80 cows. They all     
 carry a small flock of ewes up to 70. 
 7 farms concentrate on the production 
 of beef. The largest carries a suckler
 herd of 140 cows and calves, plus     
 about 1000 fell sheep. The final 2    
 farms rent out a sizeable proportion  
 of their land for summer grazing. The 
 average size of farm is about 200     
 acres, ranging from 54 acres at High  
 Stanger to 600 acres at Terrace Farm. 
 Average farm prices Â£1100 per acre.
