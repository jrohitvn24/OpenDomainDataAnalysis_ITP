		<content>Staining started with about 75 houses  
and had open views into Blackpool. The 
Plough Inn is well over 200 years old. 
Staining School used to be where the   
chip shop now stands. It had a         
headteacher and two assistants. The    
Schoolboard visited once a month to    
check on the work being done. All the  
children wore clogs, the boys breeches 
and the girls, pinafores. They had no  
homework but had to work very hard at  
home both before and after school.     
Games of marbles and collections of    
cigarette cards were very popular.     
There was one shop but it sold no      
sweets so the children made their own  
from a mixture of cocoa powder and     
sugar. Sugar butties were a favourite  
snack. Jelly and custard was a special 
treat on Sundays. The annual trip to   
Lytham was the highlight of the year   
when they wore their Sunday Best.      </content>
