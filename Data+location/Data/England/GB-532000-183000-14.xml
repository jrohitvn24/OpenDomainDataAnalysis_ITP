		<title>14ANNA SCHERE'S THEATRE</title>
		<content>                                       
  This drama theatre in Islington,is   
open for children and young adults     
from the ages of 6 to about 18 who     
get the chance to act,and learn about  
the theatre.  There used to be lessons 
twice a week but due to the enormous   
waiting list the management had to cut 
down to once a week.Although on Friday 
 here is a special 'Friday group' for  
 the proffesional actors/actresses, who
according to Anna have accomplished a  
lot in the time they have been there,  
they also have to be under contract.It 
costs 40p per week for junior/secondary
groups and 60p for the youth group.    
Every so often they put on shows open  
to the public.'The Festival Of Plays'  
derives from the best plays made up by 
the groups over a certain period of    
time.They also have open days which are
free and anyone can go and watch.      </content>
