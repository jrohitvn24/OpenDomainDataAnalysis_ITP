		<content> Shaw's Office Supplies is situated on 
 Sodylt Farm.  They sell desks, tables,
 filing cabinets and chairs as well as 
 steel cupboards, drawing boards and   
 safes.  They get all the wooden items 
 from Wrexham where they are made just 
 for Shaw's.  A coffee table, 24" by   
 18" costs Â£24 and a filing cabinet    
 with 4 drawers cost Â£67.  The wooden  
 desks are teak or sapele finish. The  
 person incharge of Shaw's has been    
 there for about 30 years.             
 Second hand goods which are in good   
 condition are bought and are sold at  
 almost the same price. This firm is   
 competitive and does a lot of business
 in the area.
