		<content> We sent questionnaires to 150 houses  
 and got 119 replies. There were 460   
 people altogether. We asked questions 
 about watching and playing sport. Only
 36 people go to watch it regularly but
 143 people watch it regularly on TV.  
 149 people never watch sport at all.  
 303 people take part in sporting      
 events once a week or more and 267    
 people do it sometimes. Only 41 people
 don't do any sport.                   
 Two of our questions were about       
 healthy eating and sponsored events.  
 128 people have tried to lose weight  
 during the year. 221 people have taken
 part in sponsored events.
