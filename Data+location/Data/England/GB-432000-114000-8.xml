		<title>08THE WATER BAILIFF</title>
		<content>{ Mr Mark Simmonds}looks after         
 Broadlands lake, keeping a watch on   
 the level of water, the health of its 
 inhabitants &amp; the tidiness of its     
 banks.To keep the number of fish at a 
 satisfactory level, he said that many 
 are now taken from the lake by using  
 nets,to sell for restocking other     
 lakes and to{' fish farmers'}who sell 
 them later for table use. Access to   
 the lake is controlled, resulting in a
{"nature reserve type"}area. Many water
 birds make use of the area for        
  breeding, amongst them,Coot,Moorhen, 
 Tufted Duck ,Little Grebe &amp; Great     
 Crested Grebe. A large flock of       
 Canada Geese,together with numerous   
 sheep, graze the surrounding areas    
 creating good conditions for many     
 species of wild flowers, which in turn
 attract a host of butterflies and     
 other insects.                        </content>
