    Owlsmoor was part of Crowthorne    
 parish. The few old houses date from  
 the early 1920's. In the late 1960's  
 some council flats and houses were    
 built. The greatest phase of building 
 has been in the late 1970's and is    
 still going on. Several hundred       
 private dwellings have been built.    
{CROWTHORNE                            
    An attractive mixture of semi-     
 detached and detached owner occupied  
 houses and bungalows are set in tree- 
 lined roads.The latest addition has   
 been the development of blocks of     
 sheltered flats for senior citizens.  
    Some 19th. century terraced        
 cottages have survived in the High    
 Street and on the Broadmoor Estate    
 where Broadmoor Hospital provides a   
 variety of rented accomodation for    
 its staff and their families.         </content>
