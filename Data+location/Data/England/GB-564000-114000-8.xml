		<content> A century ago you could have found a  
 harness maker,a blachsmith,and a clog 
 and patten maker in all our Wealden   
 villages. Today there is indeed a     
 blacksmith, though he intends to      
 retire at 30, so he hasn't got much   
 time left.He can do hot or cold       
 shoeing,brazing,welding and ornamental
 metalwork.A lady in Bodle Street makes
 soft toys and sells them from her     
 cottage.A man at the north end of the 
 village makes garden ornaments out of 
 broken tiles and cement - urns,plant  
 pots and sundials.There is also an    
 artist in Bodle Street who, on        
 occasions, exhibits and sells his     
 paintings. Most of our creativity as a
 village seems to go into our gardens, 
 and Back Lane in Bodle Street is as   
 pretty a street of cottage gardens as 
 you could find anywhere.
