		<content> Comfortable, well nourished, farming  
 life. Varied, well balanced home grown
 diet. Nearest shops five miles.       
 Domestic animals - dogs and cats. All 
 farms keep guard dogs and a small     
 percentage own fire extinguishers.    
 Most farms are owned by local land    
 owner Lord Lilford, whose present     
 policy is to sell houses, when        
 possible, and incorporate the land    
 into a vast open growing area. Green  
 Belt area, ie unable to be used for   
 house building. Whilst the majority of
 houses incorporate a bath and an      
 inside toilet, none are connected to  
 the main sewer. Mains water is        
 supplied to all houses, but in some   
 instances (ie dairy farms) these are  
 suoplemented by private artesian      
 wells, because of low pressure. The   
 only source of energy is electric.
