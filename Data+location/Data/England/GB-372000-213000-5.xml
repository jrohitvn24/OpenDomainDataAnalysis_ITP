		<content> Although the houses are spaced        
 out,people are well-known to each     
 other and are very aware of the lives 
 around them.Like it or not,others     
 often seem to know your business      
 before you yourself do:this leads to a
 wrap-around community feeling in which
 children grow up known to everyone and
 knowing everyone,a strong sense of    
 belonging and with a realisation of   
 their own identity within the scheme  
 of things.There is no hiding behind   
 anonymity round here:you live with    
 your successes and failures,your      
 moments of glory and your             
 follies;neither is there any fear of  
 being lost because someone somewhere  
 is sure to be on hand who knows       
 you,your family and all its           
 histories.This local knowledge seems  
 little changed by the increased       
 mobility of residents nowadays.       </content>
