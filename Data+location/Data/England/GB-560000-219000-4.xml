		<title>04Industry in Dunmow</title>
		<content>   There are two industrial estates in 
 Dunmow. The largest is off Chelmsford 
 Road, and the other is near Ongar     
 Road. Both are away from the main     
 shopping area and houses. Most of the 
 industrial units are small businesses.
 Some of them are like shops and sell  
 things such as car tyres, timber and  
 'do-it-yourself' goods. Other units   
 incude boat and car repairs,          
 engineering firms and tool makers.    
   The largest single employer is Carr,
 Day and Martin who deal with household
 cleaning equipment such as furniture  
 and shoe polish.                      
   Special mention must be made of the 
 Dunmow Flitch Bacon Factory which was 
 an important employer in the area.    
 Unforunately this factory closed last 
 year and resulted in a loss of many   
 jobs.
