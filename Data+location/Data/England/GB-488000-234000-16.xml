		<content> Many people have to travel to         
 Bletchley,Milton Keynes and other     
 surrounding districts for any         
 organised leisure activities.         
 but many villagers spend their spare  
 time at home either reading,watching  
 television or gardening and           
 maintaining their own homes. There    
 are several clubs held in the village 
 which are fairly well attended;       
 Football and Cricket Clubs,Model      
 Aeroplane Club, Darts and Dominoes,   
 Yoga. There is a Tuesday Club for the 
 local O.A.P. who recently went on a   
 day visit to the seaside. The village 
 band and choir practice reguarly. The 
 toddlers attend the village playgroup 
 and there is a Music Group for        
 slightly older children and a Youth   
 Club.A Pony Trekking Centre on the    
 farm was opened a short while ago.
