		<title>09       TREVOR  MACDONALD</title>
		<content>  Journalist, newscaster and author,   
 Trevor lives in Sheen because he finds
 it a pleasant, friendly place,        
 convenient for work.                  
  He is currently publicising his new  
 book about West Indies cricketer Clive
 Lloyd. Trevor Macdonald was born and  
 educated in Trinidad. He read Politics
 at university. He first got involved  
 in broadcasting while at school, where
 he ran a radio show on the intercom.  
  He is surprised that his becoming the
 first black newsreader in the UK      
 should have created so much interest. 
  He is ambivalent about his work. TV  
 newsreading is a team effort, offering
 little personal reward. It is         
 glamorous but lightweight, unlike     
 reporting on the international        
 political scene, which he views as a  
 way of bringing about greater         
 understanding between people.         </content>
