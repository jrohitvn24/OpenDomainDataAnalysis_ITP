		<content> Brighton is a large town requiring    
 lots of transport services. British   
 Rail provides a fast service to and   
 from London for holiday makers and    
 commuters alike. The railway also goes
 to hastings to the east and Portsmouth
 to the west.                          
 Southdown offers a comprehensive bus  
 service, and they guarantee that you  
 can get from any district in Brighton 
 without changing bus more than once.  
 There is also a shuttle service, where
 the buses are more frequent but they  
 only fery people to and from set      
 locations.                            
 you can telephone a taxi to take you  
 anywhere in Brighton, or catch one    
 from dedicated stations. They cost    
 more than buses, but are more         
 comfortable.
