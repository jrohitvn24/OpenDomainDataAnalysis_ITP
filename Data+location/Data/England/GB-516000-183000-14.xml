		<title>14Life Style: A Diwali Party</title>
		<content>  Before the holidays our teacher      
 said we were going to have a Diwali   
 party at school.The girls could bring 
 their saris. All the class brought    
 different kinds of food to school. I  
 brought pappadums.                    
  On the Friday after our music lesson 
 the girls went and changed into their 
 saris and then went to our classroom. 
  Our teacher had arranged the tables  
 and put the food out.She put on Indian
 music and we played musical bumps.    
  Then we ate the food,it was delicious
 and I ate my favourite food called    
 samosas.                              
  We lit a candle near the blackboard  
 because Diwali is a festival of light.
 Hindu's believe that Lakshami,the     
 goddess of wealth and fortune,will    
 bring good luck on this day.          
  I really enjoyed the Diwali party    
 very much.                            </content>
