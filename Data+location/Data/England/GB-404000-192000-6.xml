		<content>  To the east of The Church is one of  
 the {four crosses}which can be seen in
 the village.  The others are at the   
 end of Church Walk; by the White Hart 
 Inn and by one of the shops.  No-one  
 knows why the crosses were erected.   
 They may have been "preaching crosses"
 or some past indication of Ashton     
 Keynes' importance as a crossing point
 of the Thames on the Marlborough to   
 Cirencester road.                     
  Many of the names of houses in the   
 village tell of former uses.  You can 
 find 'forges' and 'mill', and two     
 former chapels which are now houses.  
  Another feature to look for is the   
 'tilestones' of limestone, marking    
 boundries of some of the gardens.     
 They stand about sixty centimetres    
 high.
