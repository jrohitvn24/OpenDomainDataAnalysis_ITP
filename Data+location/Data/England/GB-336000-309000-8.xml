		<title>08Clock and Watch-mending.</title>
		<content>  When he had to give up the building  
 trade after an illness in{1944,Mr.Ern-
{est Davies,Brook House,Stoney Stretton
 needed a job that he could do at home 
 so he taught himself to mend clocks   
 and watches.At first he worked for    
 jewellers in Shrewsbury,but he built  
 up a business at home and had         
 customers from as far as Wellington.  
  He has mended all kinds of clocks and
 watches,but since 1980 he has just    
 done it as a hobby because the parts  
 are so expensive and hard to get and  
 more people have battery clocks and   
 watches and ones made of plastic.     
  He has shelves full of pots and      
 watches so he's still busy all day.   
 It's a very fiddly hobby,but he likes 
 it better than television.
