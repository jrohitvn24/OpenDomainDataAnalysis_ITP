		<content>  Miss Bentall came to visit us. Her   
 family has lived in Barling for 94    
 years.Miss Bentall works in her       
 orchard she sells quite a lot of      
 plums, apples, raspberries,           
 gooseberries and blackcurrants a      
 year.Miss Bentall's house is 300 years
 old. It is called Bolts Farm and she  
 has lived there for all her life. Miss
 Bentall remembered that when she was a
 child the village was very pretty and 
 that the people went about on horses, 
 bikes and there were only a couple of 
 cars.Miss Bentall said Barling was    
 still very pretty. She said she does  
 not like the tip and everyone says the
 same. Behind Miss Bentall's house     
 there is the River Roach. Miss Bentall
 can remember when sailing barges      
 used to come to the old quay at       
 the end of her lane to load wheat for 
 the mill at Stambridge.               </content>
