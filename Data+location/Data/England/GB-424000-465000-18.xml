		<content> PARK HOUSE FARM                       
 There is an older part of the farm    
 house which was built in 1604.This    
 formed part of the dining hall and was
 used by the working monks.This room   
 contains the original lnglenook       
 fireplace which was part of the       
 kitchen.The newer part of the house   
 was built in 1810 on the foundations  
 of the dining hall.The farm has four  
 man_made fish ponds which were farmed 
 by the monks.These are now dry due to 
 the water deing dammed at Dean Lake.  
 The boundaries of the farm are        
 surrounded by the ruins of a wall     
 which was built by the monks and which
 is known as the Monks'Wall.It is now a
 dairy farm,but there are a few young  
 beef calves too.They use Leyburn      
 market for calves and Otley for well_ 
 bred dales cattle.
