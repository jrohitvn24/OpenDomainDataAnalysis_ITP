The building was built by Charles Cope 
Trubshaw in 1742 as a home which he    
called Mount Pleasant. It later became 
a hunting lodge for Lord Tamworth and  
was sold after his death to a group of 
Benedictine Nuns in 1833, who later    
incorporated it into St. Benedict's    
Priory.                                
There are some twenty nuns here now,   
under the Abbess, Dame Edith. They are 
an enclosed order. This particular     
Benedictine order was founded in Paris 
in 1661 and came to England some time  
after the French Revolution.           
Each of the nuns have their own room.  
They are self sufficient in vegetables 
and bake some bread. The nuns rise each
day at 5.30am and usually attend chapel
service seven times before lights out  
at 10.00pm.
