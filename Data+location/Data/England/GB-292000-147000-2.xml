		<title>02THE NORTH HILL TRAIL.</title>
		<content> THE UNFENCED AREAS OF NORTH HILL ARE  
 ACCESSIBLE TO THE PUBLIC BECAUSE THEY 
 ARE OWNED BY THREE PUBLIC BODIES:- THE
 NATIONAL TRUST, THE SOMERSET COUNTY   
 COUNCIL AND THE WEST SOMERSET DISTRICT
 COUNCIL.  RECENTLY THE NATIONAL PARK  
 HAS ACQUIRED A PART OF NORTH HILL.    
 NORTH HILL HAS A LONG MILITARY        
 HISTORY. AS LONG AGO AS THE IRON AGE, 
 DEFENCE POSTS WERE CONSTRUCTED THERE. 
 BURY CASTLE(ABOVE SELWORTHY) IS A GOOD
 EXAMPLE OF THE REMAINS OF A HILL FORT.
 THERE ARE ALSO SEVERAL EXCAVATED      
 BARROWS (BURIAL MOUNDS) DOTTED ABOUT  
 THE HILL. ABOVE THE  RUINS OF THE WEST
 MYNE FARM IS EVIDENCE OF ANOTHER      
 DEFENCE POST WHICH WAS PROBABLY USED  
 TO PROTECT IRON AGE MAN'S LIVESTOCK.  
 HORSES WERE BOUGHT FROM LOCAL FARMERS,
 GIVEN INITAL TRAINING AND THEN        
 MARSHELLED TO THE STATION YARD FOR    
 TRANSPORTAION TO THE FRONT.           </content>
