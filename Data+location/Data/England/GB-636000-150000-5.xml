		<content> The school opened in{1853.}The        
 buildings are old and need to be      
 decorated. There are six classrooms,  
 four for the Juniors and two for the  
 Infants. We have two halls, a swimming
 pool, a library, a playground and a   
 school field. There six teachers, a   
 headmaster, a secretary and caretaker.
 The school's{Parent Teacher           
{Association}(PTA) raises money and has
 bought a television, radios, a        
 computer and a video recorder.        
                                       
 Sometimes parents help with{sports}and
 outings. We do many sports at this    
 school including football, netball,   
 swimming and rounders. In the 1984-85 
 season the{football team}has been very
 successful winning a trophy in an 11  
 a-side competition and two in 6 a-side
 competitions.
