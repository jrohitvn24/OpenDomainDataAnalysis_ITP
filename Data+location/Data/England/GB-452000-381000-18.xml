		<content> Most mothers go out in their cars and 
 buy food from{Supermarkets}like Tesco 
 and Hillards at{Worksop.}They buy food
 to put in their freezers instead of   
 making it all themselves. The         
 favourite meal is fish and chips and  
 some people like foreign food as well 
 such as Indian curry and Chinese food 
 from Chinese Takeaways in{Dinnington  
 or Worksop.All our class watch TV     
 every night for at least one hour or  
 more.The favourite programme is Dallas
 Dallas is an American programme called
 a soap opera,about a wealthy oil      
 family.Almost every one has got a car.
 But there are still some families     
 without one.Nearly everyone has got a 
{telephone.}And most people have got a 
{computer.}Most people have {pets. }The
 most popular pet is a dog.You have to 
 have a licence to own a dog but not a 
 cat.                                  </content>
