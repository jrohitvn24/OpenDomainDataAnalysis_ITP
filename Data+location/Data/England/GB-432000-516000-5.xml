		<title>05SADBERGE VILLAGE HALL</title>
		<content> The village hall used to be the       
 village school.In{1964}when the new   
 school was built it was extended and  
 is now used as our meeting place.The  
{senior citizens}have a meeting there  
 on a Thursday.Doctor Andrews holds his
{surgery}there  on a Monday and Friday 
 afternoon because we have no doctors  
 surgery in the village.There is  also 
{sewing,bingo,badminton}and a{dancing  
{class.}The best thing held there is   
 the{Youth Club}to which I go. It is   
 held on a Friday night.From 6.30 to   
 8.30.Most of the children in the      
 village aged 5 to 15 go there.The boys
 can play football and the girls play  
 basket ball or rounders.There is also 
 snooker,table tennis and some of us   
 like to make things such as masks or  
 we draw pictures.There are drinks,    
 crisps and sweets for us to buy.We all
 have a great time By Clare Dickens(10)</content>
