		<title>19Cramlington:Attitudes</title>
		<content> The children of Crawhall First School 
 found out,by means of a questionnaire,
 what the people of Cramlington think  
 about their town. The questions were  
 compiled by the children, and they    
 tried to ask a good cross section of  
 the inhabitants of the town.          
    They found out that:               
 a) People think it is quite a pleasant
    place to live.                     
 b) People chose to live here because  
    it was convenient for their work or
    because they have roots here.      
 c) The changes they would like to see 
 are: 1 more employment                
      2 better policing                
      3 provision of a hospital        
      4 provision of a second High     
        School or College              
      5 greater tidiness
