		<content>On Tues.18thJune Mr Boughey from the   
TAMWORTH HERALD came to Atherstone     
North and showed us a film called      
THE TAMWORTH HERALD STORY and that     
showed us the stages of making a       
newspaper.    Afterwards we asked him  
questions like  "How many papers does  
he make?"or"Has he  ever been on       
holiday,seen something and brought it  
back as a story?"-"No" was the         
reply,but he's hoping to in future.    
Then he told everybody about the       
paper- club called SCOOPER(of which I  
am a member).He left us with SCOOPER   
stickers and paper hats ,whch said"I   
LOVE SCOOPER"The 4th years also        
watched the film ,because they were    
doing a project on SERVICES.When       
everyone had gone out of the hall my   
teacher called me over and introduced  
me to Mr Boughy , for I had            
arranged the visit. NICOLA WARD AGE10  </content>
