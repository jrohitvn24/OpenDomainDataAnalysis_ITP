		<title>09TRAFFIC IN GURNARD.</title>
		<content> The roads in Gurnard are not very     
 busy.Most traffic coming into Gurnard 
 comes up Tuttons Hill.It is mostly    
 private cars.There is plenty of room  
 for parking in Worsley Road because it
 is such a wide road.Church Road is    
 very narrow and people park cars in   
 the road because they don't have      
 garages. It is difficult to drive     
 along with all the parked cars.I      
 checked on the makes of cars parked in
 Gurnard.There were more foreign than  
 British cars(16 foreign,8 British).The
 most popular car was Ford.
