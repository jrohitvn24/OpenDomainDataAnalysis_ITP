 am eight years old. I have a sister   
 called Kate Elizabeth, and she is six.
 My Mum and Dad are both teachers and we  
 live in Leeds. My{hobbies}are going to     
 Brownies, playing the recorder and    
 piano, swimming and roller skating. I 
 enjoy reading mystery and adventure   
 stories such as Nancy Drew or Secret  
 Seven and Famous Five books. My       
{favourite subjects in school}are Art, 
 Geography and History.I like these    
 subjects as I find them fascinating. I
 enjoy travelling around the country   
 during the school holidays to         
 interesting places such as the Lake   
 District and London. My{ambitions}are 
 to be a musician or a clothes         
 designer. I would also like to travel 
 the world and be a happy person.
