		<title>08 THE MOORS MURDERS</title>
		<content>   The dark shadow that hovered over   
Hattersley for the last twenty years   
and still lingers is the Moors Murder  
case.                                  
   Ian Brady and Myra Hindley lived at 
16,Wardle Brook Avenue. In November    
1963 John Kilbride was missing,December
1964 Leslie Ann Downey was missing and 
in October 1965 Edward Evans was       
murdered. Ian Brady and Myra Hindley   
were caught with Edward Evans dead body
in the house.                          
   The trial began in April 1966. Both 
were found guilty and jailed for life. 
They are still serving sentence.       
   Local people are still very         
sensitive about the subject and the    
majority unforgiving.                  
   Manchester Corporation often have   
letters from people who want to live in
the Moors Murderers house. Others      
prefer any house but that one.         </content>
