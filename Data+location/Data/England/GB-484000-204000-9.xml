{Coombe Hill as a Centre of Recreation 
 Coombe Hill is a popular venue for    
 walkers and many footpaths criss_cross
 its summit. At holiday time and at    
 weekends many families use it as a    
 picnic area and is a favourite spot to
 exercise their dogs.As the highest    
 point in the Chilterns it is a        
 splendid spot for kite flying and is  
 the HQ. of a model Aeroplane club.    
 This is the Coombe Hill Soaring       
 Association. In winter snow, the hill 
 is alive with sledgers and skiers as  
 the steep slopes give exellent sport. 
 Below the summit in the hamlet of     
 Coombe, the former school buildings   
 are the property of the Girl Guide    
 Association.Guides and Brownie packs  
 of the district use it for camping and
 instuctional weekends. There is enough
 space for the traditional camp fire.  </content>
