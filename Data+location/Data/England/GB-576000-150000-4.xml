		<title>04BRISHING COURT FARM</title>
		<content> The land and farm of Brishing Court   
 have been in the possession of the    
 Skinner family for 150 or so years.   
 The person that was interviewed, who  
 is not a member of the family, has    
 been working there for the past 25    
 years. The house itself is over 500   
 years old; while the 17th century Lord
 Fairfax was living at nearby Leeds    
 Castle, his mother was living at      
 Brishing Court. Mr Billy Skinner now  
 lives here and works the farm.        
 Potatoes, hard fruit and corn are     
 grown on the 60 hectares (170 acres)  
 of land, and there is grazing for 550 
 sheep and lambs, some of which are    
 also sometimes grazed on the Loose    
 Swiss Scout land further down the     
 valley.
