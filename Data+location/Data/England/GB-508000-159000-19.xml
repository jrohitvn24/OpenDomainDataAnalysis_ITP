		<content> Dawn Slough, a reporter with the News 
 and Mail, was interviewed about       
 stories which were developing after   
 the week ending 10th July 1985.       
                                       
 She said that,with the closure of St. 
 Andrew's Secondary School, there was a
 row brewing about who should pay to   
 bus the  children from Cobham to      
 their new school, Trinity, in Esher.  
                                       
 The following week there was to be a  
 story about a missing person that the 
 police were after.                    
                                       
 The details of the proposed new routes
 for the Heathrow - Gatwick link       
 helicopter (which affects the Cobham  
 area) would be published.
