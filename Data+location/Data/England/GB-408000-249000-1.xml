		<content> Bickmarsh,Cleeve Prior, The           
 Littletons,and Ullington is a country 
 area comprised of farms and market    
 gardens.  The land is gently          
 undulating varying between thirty     
 eight and fifty three metres above sea
 level. There are eight farms growing a
 wide variety of crops from cereal to  
 hay for silage. Oil seed rape has     
 become popular  and has a government  
 subsidy. Many of the market gardens   
 are small family concerns, they are   
 kept very busy the whole year and grow
 cabbages, cauliflowers, beans,        
 tomatoes, carrots, leeks, spring      
 onions, sprouts and rhubarb. This area
 is nationally famous for market garden
 produce. A few orchards have been left
 in the area but many have been grubbed
 up in the last decade.
