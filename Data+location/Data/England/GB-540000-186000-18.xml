		<content> There is a tree in St.Mary's          
 Churchyard, said to be a thousand     
 years old. It has supplied bows and   
 arrows for English archers at the     
 Battle of Agincourt. This yew is said 
 to have been struck by lightning.     
 A feature of the churchyard which     
 usually arouses the curiosity of      
 newcomers is the tall, stone, hut     
 shaped edifice (standing to the east  
 of the yew tree).It was called the    
 'Watcher's Box'.Those who kept their  
 vigil there had been posted there to  
 prevent or frustrate the ghoulish     
 activities of the body-snatchers.     
 According to old newspaper reports    
 dated l824,gangs of body-snatchers    
 made persistent raids on the          
 churchyard in the middle of the night.
 It was said that they had a ready     
 market for their melancholy loot      
 amongst the young medical students.   </content>
