		<content>      In Gloucester there are many     
 kinds of houses.There are bungalows,  
 flats,cottages,farm-houses and        
 terraced,detached and semi-detached   
 houses.About 30 years ago there were  
 not many housing estates in           
 Gloucester.But as the price of land   
 went up people sold it off and big    
 estates were built.                   
      One of the housing estates is    
 called{Coppice}Corner.Between 49 and  
 70 AD Coppice Corner was a Roman      
 burial ground with 600 bodies buried  
 there.The archaeologists found many   
 skeletons when they excavated the     
 area.Bryants Homes bought it in 1983. 
  70 houses are built already and      
 altogether there will be 106 when it  
 is finished.I don't think it will     
 expand because it is surrounded by    
 roads,other houses,and Oxstalls       
 playing fields.                       </content>
