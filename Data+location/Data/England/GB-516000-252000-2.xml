		<content> The rise and fall of Tempsford has    
 been caused by one main               
 factor,transport.At one time the      
 village could boast all means of      
 transport.From bridges to barges roads
 and railways and an airfield.Today the
 A1 the main north to south artery     
 dissects the village clean in two just
 like the old Roman road ,The Great    
 North Road did  prior to the building 
 of the A1.                            
 There are two possible origins of the 
 place name. Firstly prior to a        
 sandstone bridge being built in 1736  
 there was a tempory ford in the       
 area.Secondly, when the Danes invaded 
 the area they took the river Ouse to  
 be a tributary of the river Thames    
 hence Thamesford which over the       
 centuries resulted in{Tempsford.
