		<title>11Recreation in Little Sodbury</title>
		<content>                                       
 There is not much entertainment in    
 Little Sodbury End and Horton.There   
 are no pubs and only two clubs - the  
 social club and and the village club, 
 the reason why there are not many     
 clubs is it is mainly old people who  
 live there.People stay at home,go on  
 long walks,farm,or do gardening.That  
 is why it looks very nice around these
 parts.Some people play golf for       
 recreation.The golf club is normally  
 very busy because people come from    
 Bristol to play golf.About one-third  
 of the population have moved here and 
 some are very rich.People entertain   
 their own family but sometimes in the 
 year Little Sodbury End and Horton    
 join up, and they have fetes and      
 dances and people enjoy these         
 activities.
