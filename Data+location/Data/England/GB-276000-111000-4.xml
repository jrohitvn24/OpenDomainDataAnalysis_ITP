 East Worlington Church is called St.  
 Marys and we think it dates back to   
 Norman times. There is still a Norman 
 arch and window.Just over a hundred   
 years ago it was rebuilt by Lord      
 Portsmouth.The school house was once a
 church house which also belonged to   
 Lord Portsmouth.The first rector was  
 Robert de Hendeville in 1261.There    
 have been 46 rectors since then.The   
 last rector to live in the rectory    
 left in 1958.The rector now is Mr     
 Hudson. He lives in Witheridge and we 
 share him with West Worlington,       
 Creacombe,Meshaw, Witheridge and      
 Thelbridge.We have Holy Communion in  
 the church once a month and Morning   
 Prayer every fifth Sunday in the      
 month.The church wardens are          
 Mr.R.Sowden and Mr.G.Boyles.
