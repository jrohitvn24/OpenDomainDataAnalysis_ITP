 near Hartlip. It is privately owned

 Nature Conservation. It is signposted 
 from Hartlip, Bredhurst, Stockbury and

 The Warren is in 3 sections;Main and  
 West Banks which are grassland and    
 Potters Wood.The main bank only is    
 open to the public,there are two foot-
 paths.The name 'Warren' comes from the
 rabbits that live on the banks.The    
 Saxons used them for meat and fur.The 
 rabbits and sheep gnaw the new trees. 
 This preserves the open grassland.    
 Badgers,foxes,voles,cuckoos,rare      
 flowers, woodpeckers and spectacular  
 trees are found;it is famous for many 
 kinds of orchid.

 tree climbing.When it snows it is     
 also popular for sledging.            </content>
