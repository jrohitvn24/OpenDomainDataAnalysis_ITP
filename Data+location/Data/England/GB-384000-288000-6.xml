Every year there is a fete on the      
cricket field.It is called Swimley     
Fete because it is for the parishes of 
Swindon and Himley.Mr.Payne is both    
Vicar of Swindon and Rector of Himley. 
It is always a very colourful          
occasion. There is a fancy dress       
contest.The first prize is a           
pound.There is a lucky dip and there   
are pony rides.They sell hot dogs and  
hamburgers.They also sell balloons.The 
St.John Ambulance played the drums and 
then they put some music  on.There is  
a book stall,a food stall and a        
pancake stall.They sell food and       
drinks and icecream in the pavillion.  
There is hoop-la and many other games. 
It is always very enjoyable.
