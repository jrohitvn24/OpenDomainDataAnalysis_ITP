		<title>15Housing 1: East Dean</title>
		<content>    There are two main areas of        
 residential housing, namely East Dean 
 and the west part of Meads.           
    The old part of East Dean dates    
 back to the Middle Ages and is        
 situated north of Birling Gap in, as  
 the name suggests, a gap in the Downs.
 However, the houses north of East Dean
 road were built in the 1930-50s as a  
 'dormitory' for people working in     
 Eastbourne and Brighton.              
    The design of these houses has     
 followed the character of the older   
 local buildings. The steeply sloping  
 roofs are covered with old, hand made 
 tiles. The inside walls are           
 constructed in ash framing with rough 
 plastered panels. Fireplaces are built
 of narrow, old bricks and hall floors 
 are laid with old flagstones.         
    They are family houses for middle  
 class people and so are expensive.    </content>
