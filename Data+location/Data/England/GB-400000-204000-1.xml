  Our block consists of 3 small        
 villages, several scattered farms and 
 some housing alongside the            
 roads. Otherwise the land is          
 mostly devoted to farming.            
   The 3 villages are called BAGENDON, 
 PERROTT'S BROOK and BAUNTON. Much of  
 the land is used for farming which is 
 either arable or dairy. Some sheep    
 graze on the higher ground. There are 
 a few areas of woodland. The block is 
 dominated by the River Churn which    
 flows North to South through the      
 area. The river flows in a steep      
 valley which is followed by the A435  
 otherwise the ground is fairly        
 hilly. There are 2 reservoirs which   
 supply Cirencester's water needs and a
 quarry which is used to produce stone 
 for house building.
