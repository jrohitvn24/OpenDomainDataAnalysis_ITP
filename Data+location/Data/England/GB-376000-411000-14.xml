		<title>14EVENTS: The Crows</title>
		<content>   Our school made local headlines in  
 Spring 1984 when we were attacked by  
 crows.There was even a small column   
 about it in one of the nationals.There
 were originally three birds but one   
 was captured and put in Greenmount    
 Bird Sanctuary.It all started when a  
 girl was attacked on her way home from
 school.The next day there was another 
 attack and to prevent them hurting    
 anyone nobody was allowed outside.    
   Since then periodic attacks have    
 been made on members of staff's cars, 
 e.g. scratching paintwork, removing   
 wiper arms, and the rubber on the     
 wipers pulled out.To prevent this     
 happening again some teachers have put
 plastic bags over their wipers.
