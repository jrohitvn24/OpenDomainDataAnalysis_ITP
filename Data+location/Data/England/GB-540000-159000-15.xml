		<content> SCRAP METAL YARD IN BIGGIN HILL       
                                       
       The scrap metal company is      
 nearly 30 years old.  This industry   
 was started by the present owner's    
 father.  His son has worked there for 
 nearly 25 years.  Now in the yard,    
 they have a 30 ton weigh bridge,      
 various lorries and forklift trucks.  
       There are lots of old items in  
 the yard but I think the most unusual 
 thing was a load of lead coffins.  The
 size of the yard is approximately 1.5 
 acres.  They have dealt with several  
 modern small planes which have        
 unfortunately crashed in the area.    
 Also quite a lot of parts of rusting  
 old Secon World War planes and machine
 gun cases.                            
       The yard is open from 8 a.m.    
 until 5 p.m. on Monday to Friday.
