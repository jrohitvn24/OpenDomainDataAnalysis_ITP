		<title>02The Church Kingsbury.</title>
		<content>  A church was built on the site of the
 present church by the Saxons in about 
 900. A stone one was first built in   
 1300AD.That is the nave of the church 
 now.The tower is particularly         
 interesting.It is called a Quantock   
 tower,as it has three sections        
 separated by horizontal lines of      
 quatrefoils.On the side of the tower  
 are several shields,one of which is   
 that of Catherine Lambroc,who provided
 the money for the building of the     
 tower about 1460.The name Lambrook    
 survives in the names of several      
 local villages.Episcopi in the name of
 the village shows that the land       
 locally was owned by the Bishop of    
 Bath and Wells.A group of us went to  
 the top of the tower one morning.To   
 the north we could see the flat fields
 of Westmoor,to the west,Burrow Hill,  
 and below the roofs of the village.   </content>
