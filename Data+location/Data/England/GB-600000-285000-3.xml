 This part of Norfolk is mainly        
{farmland,}growing cereals,sugar beet  
 and oil seed rape. In one part of the 
 block there are{pheasants}reared in   
 woodland.                             
 The{fields}are very large, many over  
 10 acres and the hedges around the    
 fields have been removed in many cases
 to enlarge the amount of productive   
 land,and to facilitate use of very    
 large{machinery.}This has caused soil 
 erosion by strong winds at certain    
 times of the year.This erosion would  
 be worse but for the few small patches
 of old woodland that remain.          
 Heavy use of herbicides and pesticides
 has reduced the natural flora and     
 fauna considerably for the last 20    
 years.
