		<content> First of all the historic house,known 
 as Whitehall,belonged to Henry Percy  
 Duke of Northumberland. Later it was  
 passed down to the Salkeld family.    
 Initals of the Salkeld's can be seen  
 above some of the doorways.Launcelot  
 Salkeld rebuilt the tower in 1589.All 
 the Salkelds were Roman Catholics.In  
 1745 Henry Salkeld was a follower of  
 Bonnie Prince Charlie,and after the   
 defeat,Henry was captured and         
 imprisoned at Carlisle.His land and   
 estate were taken into chancellory,and
 passed onto the Charltons at a later  
 date.They held them until 1858.Not    
 much later,George Moore bought        
 Whitehall,added a west wing,and built 
 the stables. These are other points of
 interest concerning Whitehall:because 
 of its long recorded history,Walter   
 Scott used Whitehall as a model for   
 'Fair Ladies' in Red Gauntlet.        </content>
