		<content>    There are six churches in our area.
 The main religion in this area is     
 Christianity, the predominant form    
 being Church of England although there
 are Methodist, Catholic, Baptist,     
 United Reform and Mormon groups.      
    Services include hymns, prayers and
 readings from the Bible.There is a    
 Sunday service every week.There are   
 sometimes special services for        
 festivals, like Easter and Christmas, 
 and also for occasions such as        
 weddings, funerals and baptisms.      
    Part of the minister's duty is to  
 visit the old and sick people and     
 young families in his parish.A        
 minister is usually responsible for   
 more than one church.                 
   A new church for the Mormon Faith   
 has been built at Wistaston this year 
 and opened in June (1985).
