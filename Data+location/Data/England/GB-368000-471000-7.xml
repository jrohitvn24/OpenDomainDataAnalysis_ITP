		<content> There are about seven or eight        
 weddings a year.Some of the land the  
 church is built on keeps moving away  
 and that's why the church has been    
 built so many times.The new room was  
 built because the old Parish Room     
 wasn't very satisfactory and they more
 or less wanted something on the same  
 premises.Steven Wright did the        
 building of the new room and Mr Howson
 did the electrics.Mr Lawson did the   
 plumbing work.The new room is used    
 for all sorts of things like Sunday   
 School parties, private events,       
 meetings and organisations.Reverend   
 Wray,the Vicar of Ingleton told us    
 that the present church will last for 
 about another twenty_five years       
 before it is in danger of beginning to
 collapse again.A lot of work to       
 strengthen the foundations will have  
 to be done.                           </content>
