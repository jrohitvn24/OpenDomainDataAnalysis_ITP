		<title>13MANDALAY CARAVAN SITE</title>
		<content> Mandalay Farm is a medium sized camp  
 site recognized by the Caravan and    
 Camping Clubs. This secluded site is  
 pleasantly situated in 12.5 acres of  
 open meadowland.There is an abundance 
 of wild flowers due to the lack of    
 sprays and pesticides.The only        
 amenities provided are one water tap, 
 cess pit and rubbish pit. There are   
 two horses which can be ridden by     
 visitors to the site. The camp site   
 was bought by the present owner in    
 1956 and has on average 2 or 3        
 caravans per week. Tents are also     
 welcome at this site. There are 4     
 rallies a year attended by an average 
 of 2O caravans. People from all over  
 Europe have visited the site and often
 return.
