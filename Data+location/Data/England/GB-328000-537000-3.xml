		<content> There are approximately 56 homes; the 
 majority are farmhouses. Some have    
 been converted from barns or derelict 
 buildings; two are modern farm        
 bungalows and one a mobile home. Few  
 houses are tenanted, most families    
 own their property; three are holiday 
 homes. All houses have mains          
 electricity. There is no piped gas.   
 Isolated houses use spring water;     
 Fellside, Greenrigg and Whelpo are on 
 mains water. Sewerage is to septic    
 tanks. The Lake District Special      
 Planning Board oversees building and  
 land use.                             
                                       
 Health: The health centre for the area
 is two miles to the east, with three  
 doctors and health visitors, working  
 from a modern surgery. A home visiting
 service is available. Prescriptions   
 are dispensed at the surgery.         </content>
