		<content> Glaxo is Britain's biggest pharmaceu- 
 -tical company.The Barnard Castle     
 factory opened in 1964 and is the     
 town's largest employer with a staff  
 of 4500,half women.It was built to    
 make penicillin and did this until    
 1976,when it changed to making tablets
 ,injectable products,creams, lotions  
 and packaging Glaxo's products .The   
 factory has been extended three times 
 since 1970.Now a new store is being   
 built and more staff employed.My      
 father works at Glaxo.He starts at    
 8am and finishes at 5pm.He works in   
 a department called Injections and    
 Tropicals.In this dept they make      
 sterile injections for use in         
 hospitals,cream for use in tropical   
 areas,and ointment.Glaxo also have a  
 very good Sports and Social club and
