		<title>02A POPULATION SURVEY</title>
		<content>   As the population has increased     
 greatly in the last 15 years we       
 decided to do a survey,using the 500  
 children and their parents in our     
 school,to see where they were born.We 
 found that 151 of the children were   
 born in Cranleigh or the villages     
 nearby.Very few of their parents were 
 born in Cranleigh though.187 were born
 in Surrey but 92 were born in Greater 
 London,49 in the Midlands 43 in North 
 West England.                         
   We wondered whether parents worked  
 in Cranleigh but after surveying we   
 found that most fathers worked in     
 London. Over 100 worked in other parts
 of Surrey. Only 44 worked in Cranleigh
 and 39 in Guildford.                  
   Most of the mothers worked locally. 
 We think this is because they often   
 work part-time and want to be near    
 when their children finish school.    </content>
