		<content>{   Bakewell Show}is held every August.
 It  used  to  be the  largest  one-day
 show in Britain,  and was known as the
{"Little Royal", }but  now it lasts two
 days.  Although mainly an{Agricultural
{Show,}it caters for all interests, and
 includes displays,  sideshows, stalls,
 competitions and a fair.              
    Recent  examples  of  displays have
 included police dogs, hot-air balloons
 and falconry.   Very often it seems to
 rain, but that doesn't stop as many as
 40000  tourists from pouring in to see
 Bakewell Show.  Competition  for  best
 livestock  prizes  is  very fierce and
 entries are  attracted  from  all over
 Britain.  The Bakewell Show  was first
 held  in  1843  and  was  organised by
 local farmers.
