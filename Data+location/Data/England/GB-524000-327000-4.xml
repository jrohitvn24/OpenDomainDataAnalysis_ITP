		<title>04Fenland Farm.</title>
		<content>      This is a medium-sized family-   
 owned fenland siltland farm of grade I
 agricultural land, producing potatoes,
 sugar beet, vining peas, onions, veg  
 (i.e.cauliflower, cabbage and savoy)  
 and wheat.                            
      We are a member of Lincolnshire  
 Marketing Organisation which is a     
 farmer owned Co-op for grading and    
 selling potatoes and onions.  We are  
 also a member of Portland Pea Growers 
 producing 450 acres of vining peas of 
 which we grow 35 acres.               
      Part of the vining acreage is    
 followed by Japenese onions, harvested
 in July and immediately followed by   
 savoys which are cut in February and  
 followed by potatoes - this gives     
 three crops in 2 years.               
      We have 3 workers (1 part-time), 
 six tractors, one fork-lift and a     
 combine harvester.        George Sly. </content>
