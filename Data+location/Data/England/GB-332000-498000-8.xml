		<content> Transport is entirely by road, all    
 heavy goods being moved by wagons     
 including timber and consumer goods.  
 Most travellers use private cars,     
 public transport being very limited.  
 The{Ribble Bus Company}runs a         
 scheduled service connecting          
 Hawkshead, Ambleside, Coniston and    
 Ulverston. There are buses four times 
 daily throughout the year and two     
 extra in the summer season. An extra  
 service is run on Wednesday to the    
 Windermere ferry and on Thursday to   
 Ulverson for market. The roads, being 
 narrow, become very congested during  
 the summer season and the large car   
 park is often full. The{Mountain Goat,
 a private company, provides daily     
 tours to Hawkshead and Tarn Hows from 
 Keswick and Windermere during the     
 summer season. School transport from  
 outlying districts is by minibus.     </content>
