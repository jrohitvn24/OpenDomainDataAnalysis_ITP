		<content> St Neot church windows.               
 The west window of the north aisle is 
 the St George window.Like the St Neot 
 window this presents life like scenes 
 from the legendary history of the     
 Saint.In the centre is seen the       
 madallion of the order of the red     
 cross knights,representing St George  
 slaying the dragon whilst on either   
 side is his shield with his           
 traditional red cross.The east window 
 at the high altar is the work of      
 Hedgeland as are the two windows in   
 the organ chamber.The Armorial window 
 was also designed by him.The window   
 was donated by another well known     
 family-the Grylls.This contains arms  
 of the Grylls family with dates       
 ranging from 1530 to that of the donor
 and his wife.This is in a scroll which
 says, "Grylls and Hill 1783".
