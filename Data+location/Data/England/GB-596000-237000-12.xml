  THE PLAYGROUP was started in 1980 for
children from two and a half years     
old.The meetings are on three mornings 
a week and the children join in social 
play,develop motor skills with art     
activities and constructional toys.The 
children also visit the village school.
  THE OVER-SIXTIES CLUB,formed over    
twenty years ago,also meets in the     
Village Hall.People from all over the  
village enjoy a not too serious game of
whist,have tea and biscuits,and a game 
of Bingo with a prize for everyone.    
There is a 20P subscription and Whist  
drives and a bazaar are held to raise  
further funds.An outing to the sea-side
is held in early September.The elderly 
rely upon willing volunteers to        
transport them to the Village Hall.
