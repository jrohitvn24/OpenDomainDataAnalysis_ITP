		<content> School Meals 20 years ago were very   
 filling but often not very good for   
 you. Our school chef tries to provide 
 a balanced meal. We have lots of      
{yogurt}and few sponges. People are    
 aware of being{overweight}to-day. Lots
 of people work in offices so don't    
 burn up calories. They shouldn't eat  
 large meals. We have lots of          
 preservatives and artificial          
 colourings in our food and eat refined
 flours.{Health food shops}sell food   
 free from artificial sweetener,       
 colouring and preservatives. Adverts  
 on television tell us to eat margarine
 which is lower in cholesterol than    
 butter.                               
  The{favourite foods}in our school    
 survey was roast meat and hamburgers  
 with chips. Others loved clams,cold   
 custard,spaghetti,chinese and indian  
 food.                                 </content>
