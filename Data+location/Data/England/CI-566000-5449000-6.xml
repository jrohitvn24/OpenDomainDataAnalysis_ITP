		<title>06TO FLOOD THE VALLEY OR NOT?</title>
		<content>   The decision in the mid 1970s by    
 the Waterworks Company to{flood }     
{Queen's Valley,}immediately raised a  
 major opposition.  This opposition    
 quickly organised itself and mounted a
 campaign of tremendous pressure       
 against the flooding.  The Waterorks's
 figures for{projected}water           
 consumption were questioned - even 10 
 years has shown the company to have   
 been{wrong-}and economies were        
 suggested.                            
                                       
   In spite of compelling the          
{resignation}of the responsible        
 committee in the States as the result 
 of a petition{unique in Jersey's }    
{history,}the States finally agreed to 
 flood by 1 vote. However, the campaign
 has continued and the anti-flooding   
 group have still not given up.
