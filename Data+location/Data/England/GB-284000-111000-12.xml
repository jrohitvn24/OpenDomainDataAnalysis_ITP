		<content> With the old school closed children   
 are bussed to either Tiverton area or 
 Chulmleigh. Most aged 5 to 9 go to    
 Bickleigh First School. They learn    
 reading, writing, maths and follow a  
 project approach to other subjects.   
 When 9 years old children go to       
 William Shapland Middle School in     
 Tiverton. Here they gradually move    
 from project work to learning in a    
 subject based curriculum.             
 At 13 they join all Tiverton area     
 children at the Tiverton Comprehensive
 School. Here most take O-level or CSE 
 exams at 16, the legal school-leaving 
 age.Some go straight out to work,     
 others sit further exams at the school
 or the College of Further Education   
 for academic or craft qualifications. 
 For tertiary education in colleges or 
 universities young people have to go  
 away from the area.                   </content>
