		<title>19LIFE AT SCHOOL NEAR WOODFORD</title>
		<content>   There are ten dormitories in our    
 school, they are named after birds or 
 wild flowers. We are woken up at 7.30 
 each morning by a matron,and we get   
 dressed and wash and strip back our   
 beds to air them. About ten minutes   
 later a bell rings and we go down to  
 the big form room and line up in our  
 clubs. When we are all quiet we go and
 fetch a bowl  and take some cereal.   
 Every one can choose what she likes.  
 After breakfast we go upstairs and    
 make our beds &amp; tidy our dorms, then  
 the bell goes for prayers. On Fridays 
 we have "clubs"; at the beginning of  
 term the headmistress chooses four    
 leaders and the rest are divided up   
 into 4 clubs, we all line up in our   
 clubs &amp; all the teachers sit on       
 chairs, the club leaders call out how 
 many stars we have and we see which   
 club has the most stars.              </content>
