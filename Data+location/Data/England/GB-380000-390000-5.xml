    There are 445 practising Catholic  
 families who live in the              
 parish, making the total number of    
 parishioners 1335.                    
    Although the  parish caters for the
 spiritual needs of the Catholic       
 families in the area, the adjoining   
 parish centre organizes social events 
 for, and is used by many societies to 
 which all members of the community    
 catholic and non-catholic belong. The 
 Brownies and Guides are well supported
 by present and ex-pupils of the Holy  
 Family School.                        
    The Senior Citizens club meet in   
 the centre each Thursday afternoon.   
 Its 160 members are local elderly     
 people from the area who meet together
 and arrange their own social events.
