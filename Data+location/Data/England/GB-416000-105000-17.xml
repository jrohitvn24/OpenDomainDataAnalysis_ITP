		<title>17Mr. Guy - Market Gardener</title>
		<content>   This nursery was Mr. Guy's grand-   
 father's plant nursery and he himself 
 started work here at thirteen years of
 age.                                  
   He was only eighteen when he        
 inherited the business and he has now 
 given it to his two daughters and     
 their husbands. But Mr. Guy loves the 
 place and still works all day and     
 every day.                            
   Mr. Guy's first job is to start     
 watering the plants at 7a.m. or       
 earlier. Opening hours are 8a.m. till 
 5p.m., seven days per week.           
   His favourite plants are Ericas and 
 "rhodos" but he really likes them all.
   We asked him if he had any plants   
 nicked (stolen). "Yes, people sneak   
 out with litle plants under their     
 coats. And, at night, rabbits and deer
 enter the nursery and damage plants.
