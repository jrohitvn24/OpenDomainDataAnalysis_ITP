		<content>    Newcomers feel isolated because it 
 is difficult for them to overcome the 
 established ties.                     
    A social centre, such as a shop or 
 hall, would help greatly in this      
 situation. It is evident that social  
 class restricts familiarity and       
 certainly friendship. Even at a time  
 of crisis some neighbours would be    
 unaware that help was needed.         
    One farm in Braydon is owned by a  
 landlord who makes only rare, brief   
 visits to the farm, leaving the       
 running to a Manager. As some of the  
 land is also let to tenants the local 
 residents feel the arrangements have  
 broken down the social structure.     
 Certainly absentee landlords are not  
 welcome here.
