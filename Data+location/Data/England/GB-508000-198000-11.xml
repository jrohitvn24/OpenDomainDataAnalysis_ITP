		<content>Walter de Merton JM School was opened  
in 1970 when there were too many       
children in Callowland Primary School. 
The infants stayed in the old building 
and the juniors moved to the new       
building which has a field, a woodland 
and a pond. Now there are fewer        
children coming to the 2 schools and   
they are being amalgamated to form     
Beechfield JMI and Nursery. The Nursery
is being built now and an extra        
classroom. Our school is a very strange
place at the moment. It is full of     
noise, workmen, bricks, cement and     
dust. The windows stay shut so that we 
can hear our teachers and each day our 
Assembly is interrupted by the builders
hammering and the music from their     
radio.                                 
{Parkgate Junior School}is also being  
rebuilt with all the same problems. The
Infants' new school was built in 1984. </content>
