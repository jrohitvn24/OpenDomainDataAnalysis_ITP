		<title>04The Copplestone Tree</title>
		<content> Just outside the gates of the         
 graveyard is a great oak called the   
 Copplestone tree.  It is about 200-300
 years old.  It is hollow and people   
 usually have their wedding photographs
 beside it.  There are a great many    
 rumours about it and the most truthful
 of all is how it got its name.  Here  
 is the story:one Sunday afternoon     
 Christopher Copplestone the Lord of   
 the Manor in the 16th century was very
 angry with his grandson.  In the end  
 he got so angry with him that he took 
 a knife and stabbed him a number of   
 times in the heart and killed him in  
 the exact spot where the tree stands. 
 Another rumour is that if you go there
 exactly at midnight and walk round the
 tree ten times then step inside it, it
 will close in on you and you will fall
 down below the church.
