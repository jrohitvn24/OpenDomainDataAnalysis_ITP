		<title>04Northorpe: Population</title>
		<content> A survey gives the population of      
 Northorpe in Summer 1985 as 135 (60   
 male, 75 female) made up of: Under 5s 
 7 (2 male, 5 female),5-16 years 26    
 (10m,16f) 16+to21 years 16 (6m,10f) 21
 to retirement (65 for men, 60 for     
 women), 74, (35m,39f), of retirement  
 age 12 (7m 5f). The population of     
 Northope is less than a third that of 
 Scotton's 469. It has a smaller       
 proportion of under 5s than Scotton   
 (roughly 1 in 20 compared with its    
 neighbour's 1 in 12) and also fewer   
 elderly people (Scotton figures here  
 being boosted by 34 residents of Glebe
 House Rest Home). In both villages    
 roughly half the people are between 21
 and retirement and there is a healthy 
 mix of age groups, though both could  
 do with more young children.  (See 2
