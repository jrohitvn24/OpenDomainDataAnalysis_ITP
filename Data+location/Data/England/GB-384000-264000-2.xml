		<title>02FARM LABOUR</title>
		<content> We have been looking at 2 farms in our
 area,and we have been comparing them  
{THE LABOUR FORCE.                     
  The Labour Force of the Dunhampton   
 farm has been cut from 40 to 15 over  
 15 years because of mechanization.    
 Their number of casual workers may    
 vary over the course of the year.     
  On the Great Horton Farm,the farm    
 labour force has been cut from 15 to 2
 because of mechanization.The workers  
 from the Dunhampton Farm live in      
 cottages owned by the company,they    
 start work at 7.30 am and finish at   
 5.00pm and stay behind if work is not 
 done.The 2 workers from the Great     
 Horton Farm live in their own houses, 
 they start work at 6.30 am to milk    
 cows and finish work at 5.00pm,but    
 somtimes they stay if the work is     
 incomplete.
