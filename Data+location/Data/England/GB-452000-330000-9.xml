     There are two main buildings to   
 our school.The older part was built   
 in 1879 and we celebrated the school's
 centenary in 1979.The newer building  
 is surrounded by a large playing field
 which overlooks the fields and woods  
 on the outskirts of the village.There 
 is a schoolhouse but it is no longer  
 lived in by the headteacher.          
     Most of the children who come to  
 our school live in Gotham,but a few   
 miles away there are the villages of  
 Kingston-on-Soar,Thrumpton and Barton 
 -in-Fabis.The children who live here  
 also come to our school.They have to  
 catch the school bus every morning and
 every afternoon.There are about 120   
 children in our school.
