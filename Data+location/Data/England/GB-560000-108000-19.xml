		<title>19Remarks about Horse-Eye</title>
		<content> An attitude that was stumbled across  
 by a 90 year old lady is rather       
 interesting. She said that she had    
 lived on Horse-Eye Level all her life 
 and had seen a lot of change.         
 Something that she did miss was the   
 wealthy landlords. They apparantly    
 used to feel a responsibility towards 
 their tenants and amongst other things
 provided entertainment in the form of 
 Harvest Suppers and Cnristmas Parties.
 However, She did say that she         
 appreciated our modern (1980s) health 
 services and certainly a clean, piped 
 water supply.                         
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
