		<title>17Clubs in Pembury</title>
		<content> The junior and senior sections of the 
{Youth Club}have been open nine months,
 the junior club being particularly    
 popular. The senior club is open on   
 Mondays and Wednesdays, it is attended
 by about 25 on each evening. On       
 Tuesdays and Thursdays there are      
 weight lifting classes. More help is  
 needed because those running the club 
 are so busy that they do not have time
 for fund raising activities.          
  The{Scout and Guide Associations}are 
 also very active in Pembury. There are
 2 Brownie Groups and 2 Guide Groups,  
 Cubs and Scouts. They are trying to   
 raise money to build a headquarters.  
 Draws, garage sales, sponsored events,
 have all helped to raise Â£13,300. The 
 Village Fete and Craft Exhibition will
 hopefully raise more. The proposed    
 site is near Woodhill Park.
