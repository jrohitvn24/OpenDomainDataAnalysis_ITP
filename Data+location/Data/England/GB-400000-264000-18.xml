		<title>18NEW HOUSING ESTATES REDDITCH</title>
		<content> In 6 square kilometres around our     
 school, there are 7 new major house   
 builders busy creating a completely   
 different landscape for{Headless Cross
 The New Town environment has attracted
 these builders to this area.          
 Each seem to form their own estate,and
 are competing with each other for     
 buyers.The end result of this is like 
 having a row of shops in the main     
 street all displaying their goods in  
 the windows.                          
 They produce varying styles of        
 buildings, in many different sizes.   
 Some are detached houses,while others 
 are just semi-detached,or even town   
 houses in rows.                       
 The population of the region has      
 soared as a result, and it will take  
 time for a community to grow up from  
 such a new start.
