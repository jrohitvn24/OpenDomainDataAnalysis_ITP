		<title>18History of Holbeach Hurn.</title>
		<content> It is thought that the village dates  
 from about 1195.There is much evidence
 of the existance of salterns in the   
 village, and probably they date from  
 before this.At this date Thorney Abbey
 was given 1\acres of land for a       
 saltern at Hirneflete by "Conan son of
 Ellis".It is thought that the present 
 Hurn Hall was the site of Conan's     
 house.By 1849 the village was a       
 thriving community with a butcher,2   
 shopkeepers,a baker and flour dealer,2
 blacksmiths,a beer retailer,and 2     
 publicans,3 farmers and a             
 horsebreaker.The big event of the     
 village used to be the annual         
 outing.One year 11 busloads of        
 children parents and friends went off 
 for the day leaving only one villager 
 to enjoy the peace.This has now ceased
 but the village hall committee runs a 
 Christmas party and trip for children.</content>
