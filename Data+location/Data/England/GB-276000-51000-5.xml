		<content> In the 18th Century a Barony, later an
 Earldom and Viscounty was granted to  
 the Parkers of Saltram by George 111rd
 - the head of the family took the     
 title of Lord Morley as they then     
 owned the village.  The present Lord  
 Morley is Lord Lieutenant of Devon.   
                                       
 The Totnes District Plan 1984 is of   
 the opinion that small scale          
 development in this area is desirable 
 and would be beneficial to the        
 community,which has decreased         
 significantly in the past 50 years.   
 There is 0.9 acres with potential for 
 conversions and infill development -  
 if all the allowance was taken up this
 could increase the population by      
 between thirty and forty, which would 
 be a significant growth compared to   
 the preceding decade.
