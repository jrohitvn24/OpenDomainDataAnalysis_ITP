		<content> The houses in Melling and Maghull vary
 between old and new, large and small. 
 We saw enormous mansions and tiny     
 cottages but most of the population   
 live on modern estates built in the   
 last 30 years.   The oldest home we   
 saw was Barnes Farm which was built in
 l654.  One of the most interesting    
 houses which we saw was The Old House 
 which once belonged to Hornby the     
 inventor of Meccano.  Hornby's house  
 was not the only famous person's house
 we saw.  We also saw Ian St.John's    
 andIan Callaghan's (famous            
 footballers).  There is also a very   
 pleasant home for the elderly, and    
 both private and council owned        
 sheltered housing.  The whole area is 
 pleasant to live in and most houses   
 have access to a garden.
