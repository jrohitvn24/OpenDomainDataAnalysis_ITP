		<content>     There are three bus services      
through Dallinghoo and Bredfield a     
week. One on Thursday morning to       
Woodbridge which is the nearest town,  
and one which comes back in the        
afternoon. On Saturday morning there is
a bus to Ipswich, the county town of   
Suffolk, and a return bus in the       
afternoon, and there is a bus to       
Woodbridge on Saturday afternoon with a
return bus later.                      
     The children from Dallinghoo,     
Debach and Boulge who go to Bredfield  
Primary School, and all the older      
children from the area who go to       
Kingston Middle School, or Farlingaye  
High School are taken by bus.          
     Otherwise people must have their  
own transport.
