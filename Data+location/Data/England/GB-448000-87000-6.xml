		<content> At the present time Newport Harbour is
 undergoing many changes with the view 
 to accommodating visiting yachting    
 families and leisure boating.         
 Pontoons are being laid in the harbour
 to facilitate landing and portacabins 
 are being provided for toilet and     
 washing facilities.                   
 During 1984 between March and November
 some 3000 yachts made overnight stays 
 in the harbour. The highest number    
 staying any one night being 34. The   
 cost per night averages Â£2.           
 Connections for mains electricity     
 supplies are now being made.          
 Six houseboats have permanent moorings
 in the harbour.                       
 During the summer months a small      
 pleasure boat provides trips up the   
 River Medina as far as Cowes.         
 Visiting pleasure boats can have a 6  
 hour stay returing on the same tide.. </content>
