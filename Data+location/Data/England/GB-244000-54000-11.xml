		<title>11DEVONPORT</title>
		<content> Fore street was the main street of    
 Devonport before the{war(1939-45).   }
 There were many public houses, three  
 cinemas and a{theatre}called the      
 'Alhambra'. The streets were often    
 filled with{sailors}off-duty. During  
 the war Devonport was heavily{bombed} 
 because the Germans wanted to destroy 
 the{Royal Naval Dockyard.}Many houses 
 were destroyed and after the war the  
 Ministry of Defence decided to enlarge
 the Dockyard, so many houses were     
 never rebuilt. Many old people        
 remember Devonport before the war when
 it was a busy, friendly town with lots
 going on. Since the war Plymouth has  
 been developed as the{shopping centre}
 for the whole area. Though they enjoy 
 modern comforts many{senior citizens} 
 miss the old days and feel that modern
 Devonport is a very different place to
 the town they once knew.              </content>
