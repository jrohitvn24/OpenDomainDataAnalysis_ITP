		<content> There has been a church in Hemsworth  
 since the 12th century. Most of the   
 present church dates back to 1828.    
 The bell tower is 27 metres tall and  
 it holds eight bells. All the bells   
 were rung for Queen Elizabeth's       
 coronation. Six of the bells were     
 replaced prior to this and they were  
 first rung on 2nd June l953.          
 From 1975 to 1985 there have been six 
 priests in the parish. Last           
 year, 1984, there were thirty-six     
 weddings and ninety-six funerals.     
 The yew tree in the churchyard was hit
 by lightning on  the  Eve of the      
 Conversion of St.Paul in 1884, so it  
 is well over one-hundred years old.
