		<title>13Miss Moulston (An Interview)</title>
		<content>      Miss Moulston was born locally   
 she went to school here, but she went 
 to the older school, now Patterson    
 Court. The school we go to now, used  
 to be a reacreation ground. The High  
 Street has changed a lot. There used  
 to be more green grocers but now      
 there are too many Fish &amp; Chip shops, 
 clothes shops, banks and estate       
 agents. There should be a bookshop and
 another grocer. Miss Moulston has only
 one relation in Knowle, a sister-in   
 law. Miss Moulston's brother used to  
 work at the Royal British Legion on   
 the Warwick Road.                     
      During the last twenty years     
 Knowle has been greatly enlarged. It  
 is now a thriving community of shops, 
 offices and halls.                    
      There are a few Old People's     
 homes in Knowle:Patterson Court, Job's
 Close and Bentley Heath Cottages.     </content>
