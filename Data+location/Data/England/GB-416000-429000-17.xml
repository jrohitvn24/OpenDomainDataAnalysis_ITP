		<content> Since Bradford began a system of{smoke
{less zoning}in the{1960's}the City has
 become a much better place to live    
 in.Before the clean up the area       
 suffered from terrible{'pea soup' fogs
 which hung about for days.This along  
 with rows of dirty,black,back to back 
 houses did not paint a pretty picture 
 and even on clear days the many mill  
 chimneys poured out{thick black smoke.
 Much of this has now disappeared.The  
 mills have closed down or changed the 
 fuel they used.Many of the terrace    
 houses have been demolished or the    
 back to back houses have been improved
 and made into through properties.Their
 walls have been sand blasted and these
 houses look like new.The local council
 has spent money on tree and shrub     
 planting on these streets to give the 
 final touch to the improvements.
