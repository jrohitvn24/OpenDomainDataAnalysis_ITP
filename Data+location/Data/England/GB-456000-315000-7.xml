		<title>07QUORN HALL AND GROUNDS</title>
		<content>{Quorn Hall}was built in 1430 for      
 Mr.Farnham. Later it was the home of  
 Mr. Hugo Meynell Master of{Quorn Hunt.
 Now it belongs to Leicester County    
 Council and is used as an             
{International Education Centre}which  
 opened in 1978 for children who come  
 from Italy, Germany, France and       
 England. They stay for about a week   
 and go to places of interest like     
 London, York, Coventry and Leicester. 
 Sometimes they go to more local places
 like Loughborough. In good weather the
 children go swimming or boating on the
 river which runs through the grounds  
 that cover 2-3 acres. Quorn Hall has  
 two dining rooms. One can hold sixty  
 people and the other, the Farnham     
 room, can hold forty-two people. There
 is supposed to be a ghost of a woman  
 murdered by her husband in Quorn Hall.
