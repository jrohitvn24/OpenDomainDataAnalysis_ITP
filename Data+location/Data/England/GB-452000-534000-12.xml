		<title>12A Dockland Visit (part 1)</title>
		<content>{The Headland-H/pool By Nicola Parvin  
             {and By Christopher Hill  
 To-day we went to the H/pool Docks for
 a look round.First we looked at the { 
{Warrior}which is being restored in the
 Coal Dock.The{Warrior}was an original 
{iron-clad battle-ship.}On the bow of  
 the{Warrior}was a Roman figure-head   
 and on the sides were some cannons and
 a big,heavy anchor.Then we went over a
 bridge that used to open up to let    
 boats go past.Beside the bridge there 
 were lots of sprats darting about in  
 the water.After that we crossed a     
 turning bridge to look at the big     
 cranes and the scrap metal.Then we    
 went to look at the Vauxhall{cars that
{were imported from Germany,}and we saw
 how the cars were washed.We then saw a
 big building called{T.S.Abdiel}that is
 used to train sea cadets to be        
 sailors.                              </content>
