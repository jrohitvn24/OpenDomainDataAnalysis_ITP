		<title>09Life Styles in Halland</title>
		<content> Halland is a small community. Many of 
 the inhabitants have lived there for  
 all of their long lives. There are    
 also younger couples who have moved in
 recently mainly from South London in  
 search of a quiet, picturesque        
 environment. The daily occupations of 
 residents falls broadly into two      
 categories. Several have small        
 holdings in the area on which they    
 produce fruit and vegetables for their
 own use. For additional income, they  
 supply the local nursery with their   
 excess crops. Employment for other    
 residents is found outside the area in
 larger towns such as Uckfield and     
 Lewes. People need to leave the area  
 to shop. The main form of transport is
 private vehicles although there is a  
 bus route that passes through the     
 village twices a day. A school bus    
 takes the children 2 miles to school. </content>
