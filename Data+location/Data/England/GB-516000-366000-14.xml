		<title>14HOUSES IN BUCKNALL</title>
		<content> Most of the houses are built in       
{brick}(59). Other materials used for  
 the walls are{breezeblock}(2) and     
{concrete}(2).  17 houses are          
{pebbledashed,}so we could not tell the
 exact construction of the walls.  One 
 house is built of{bricks, wood, and is
{pebbledashed}too.                     
                                       
 Most houses are{detached}(57). 27 are 
{semidetached,}and 4 are{mid-terrace   
 houses.  4 buildings - the village    
 hall, the school, the church, and the 
 garage are not counted in the above   
 numbers.                              
                                       
 The buildings are in three areas of   
 Bucknall, with at least one field     
 separating each area.  The areas are: 
 Platts Lane/Chestnut Avenue;  near the
 school;   Copper Street/Horncastle    
 Road.                                 </content>
