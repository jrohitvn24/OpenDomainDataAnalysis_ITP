		<title>01Introduction to Hornby.</title>
		<content>The village of Hornby is situated in   
the Lune Valley. The River Wenning     
flows through Hornby to join the Lune  
one km. West of the village. The A683  
Lancaster to Kirkby Lonsdale road      
follows the course of the Lune and     
passes through Hornby 15 km. NE of     
Lancaster.                             
The Hornby area is an agricultural one,
mainly given over to dairy farming     
though sheep are grazed on the higher  
slopes of the fairly steep, partially  
wooded valley sides.                   
The small village of Gressingham on the
opposite bank of the River Lune has    
stone built housing clustered around   
the village church. Farms are situated 
around the two settlements.Hornby has  
two churches, two hotels, a Primary and
Secondary School, four shops, a Village
Institute and a motor business. The    
village is dominated by Hornby Castle. </content>
