		<title>02LOCAL HISTORY IN EPSOM</title>
		<content>{The name Epsom or Ebbesham derives    
 from the Anglo-Saxon name "Ebbi" and  
 "Ham" meaning village: so Ebbi's      
 village became Ebbesham, Epsham,      
 Epsom.                                
{The borough's coat of arms}was        
 designed by Revd. E.E. Dorling and was
 accepted in 1937. The green and white 
 in the arms represents the verdure and
 the chalk of the Downs; the golden    
 horses Epsom's association with horse 
 racing; and the blue wavy lines       
 represent the springs in Ewell.       
{The Wells}were opened in 1618 and led 
 to Epsom's  fame as a spa town.       
 However in 1707 John Livingstone's    
 rival wells led to the decline of     
 Epsom as a spa.{Epsom developed as an 
{important residential area}and many   
 mansions were built, such as Waterloo,
 Ashley, and Richmond houses, as well  
 as the Durdans, Lord Rosebery's home. </content>
