		<title>20THE ENTERPRISE ZONE .</title>
		<content>  This is an area of land adjacent to  
 the River Tyne which has been set     
 aside for{industrial and commercial   
{development,}in the hope that the     
 rate-free location,government grants  
 and the provision of services will    
 encourage the establishment of light  
 industry and so ease the problem of   
 unemployment in the distric           
  Stretching east to west across the   
 area,the zone centres upon land once  
 used for the dumping of fly ash slurry
 from the {Dunston B Power Station}.   
  Work began on clearing the site in   
 1984 and it is expected that a large  
 shopping and recreational complex,    
 including a watersports area will be  
 completed by the end of the decade.   
 The development will be called the    
{MetroCentre.
