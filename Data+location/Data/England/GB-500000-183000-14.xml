 In the field we collected many flowers
 and weeds.We picked Barley and Wheat, 
 left from the last crop.Shepherds     
 Purse, Mayweed and Poppies were the   
 most common of the weeds but near the 
 end of the field were  a lot purple   
 bluebell type flowers called Vetch.   
 We also saw Cow Parsley, Brooklime and
 Plantain. Wood Groundsel and White    
 Mustard were two other types. On the  
 way home we looked at some            
 Elderberries and Wild Oats. We were   
 very tempted to pick some of the      
 beautiful flowers that we saw but have
 learnt that this is how many rare     
 species of flower disappear from our  
 countryside.
