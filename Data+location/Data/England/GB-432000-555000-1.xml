		<title>01GENERAL DESCRIPTION</title>
		<content> The area covers the western suburbs of
 Sunderland and extends to the eastern 
 edge of Washington New Town. The River
 Wear flows south west to north east   
 across the area towards the North Sea.
 The A19 trunk road links the area to  
 Teeside and Tyneside.                 
 Residental areas comprise post-war    
 council estates at Pennywell, Grindon,
 Castletown and South Hylton,          
 contrasting with Victorian terraced   
 cottages, private developments and the
 modern designs of Washington.         
 Agricultural land is mainly rough     
 grazing in conjunction with industrial
 crop cultivation of rape seed. The    
 heavy industrial origins of the area  
 have been superceded by purpose built 
 suburban light industrial estates.    
 Recreational facilities include golf, 
 parks and a water fowl refuge.
