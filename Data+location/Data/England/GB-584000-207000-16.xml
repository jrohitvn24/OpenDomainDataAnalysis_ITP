		<content> *Jail Break* Firstly you pick equal   
 sides of boys and girls. The boys have
 to chase the girls until they are all 
 caught. When one is caught she is put 
 into a pretend jail. The other girls  
 have to try to touch the "prisoner"   
 and release her. Once all the girls   
 have been captured the game is over.  
 *Chocolate Release* One person is     
 chosen to be "up" and has to turn away
 from the others. The others have to   
 move about. Suddenly the one who is   
 "up" has to turn quickly round and try
 to catch somebody moving. If he does  
 then the person who has been caught   
 has to stand near to the person who is
 "up" but with his arms out. The       
 "upper" then turns away again while   
 the others have to try to touch the   
 one who has been caught and shout     
 "Chocolate Release" to free him       
 without themselves being caught.      </content>
