		<title>03THE BATTLE OF MALDON</title>
		<content>   This took place in 991.The Danes    
 often sailed to England and stole val-
 uables and burned towns.Ethelred the  
 King made a deal with the Danes.If    
 they stopped,he would pay them a large
 sum of money.Ethelred had to ask peo- 
 ple to contribute money for their own 
 protection.The Earl of Essex,Brithnoth
 refused to let his people pay up.Soon 
 the Danes began the attacks again.They
 sailed up the River Blackwater to Nor-
 they Island while Brithnoth and his   
 army waited for them on the mainland. 
 The Danes began to cross the causeway 
 which was so narrow that they were    
 hacked to pieces as they came across  
 one by one.The Danes asked if they    
 could come ashore and fight fairly.   
 Foolishly Brithnoth agreed and the    
 battle began.Brithnoth and many men   
 were killed.The Danes marched in tri- 
 umph to Danbury Hill and made camp.   </content>
