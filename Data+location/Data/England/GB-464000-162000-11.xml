		<title>11Mortimer Railway Station</title>
		<content> The station was designed by Brunel,   
 who personally supervised the building
 of the broad-guage line. It served the
 Duke of Wellington's Estate; he was on
 the platform, and so was the          
 population of Mortimer, to wave when  
 Queen Victoria rode through in 1870.  
 Although the focus of the village is  
 now at the top of the hill, the rail- 
 way still plays a vital part in       
 Mortimer life. The Ticket Office is   
 manned part-time by a long serving    
 station-mistress! Passenger movements 
 have grown from 28,000 in 1980 to     
 43,000 in 1983. The car park has been 
 extended to accommodate commuters'    
 cars (70 cars were counted in 1984    
 compared to 15 in 1974).The station   
 has been renovated in this 150th      
 anniversary of the G.W.R. It has a new
 roof with tiles replacing the slates, 
 as in the original building.          </content>
