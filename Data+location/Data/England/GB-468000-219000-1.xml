The area is a rural one consisting of  
farm land,which is predominately       
grassland,and part of the village of   
Grendon Underwood.There are three small
areas of deciduous woodland and the    
River Ray runs through part of the     
farmland.                              
    The farms are of moderate size and 
although there are four lining the     
Village Street most are in the centre  
of the land they cultivate.            
    The Village consists of one main   
street and an estate of houses used by 
the Prison Officers who work at the two
prisons adjacent.                      
    Architectural styles range from    
Tudor cruck' houses to modern four    
bedroom detached.                      
    The A41,Akeman Street,crosses the  
S.W. part of the area where there is a 
hamlet known as Kingswood.             </content>
