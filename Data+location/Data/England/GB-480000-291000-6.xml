		<content> The primary school in Medbourne closed
 in 1980 due to falling numbers.       
 Children aged from five to eleven now 
 travel by bus to Bringhurst Primary   
 School - three miles away. The middle 
 school for the area is Kibworth High  
 School which caters for the eleven to 
 fourteen age group; from here they    
 transfer to the Robert Smyth School,  
 Market Harborough where there is also 
 a sixth form.  Transport to these     
 schools is provided free.  Alternative
 state education is in Uppingham but   
 transport is the responsibilty of the 
 parents.  A good percentage of        
 children in the area attend private   
 schools either as day pupils or as    
 boarders. The Nevill Holt Preparatory 
 School takes boys and girls from the  
 age of four to thirteen.  In Medbourne
 a playgroup, run by mothers and       
 helpers, meets three mornings a week. </content>
