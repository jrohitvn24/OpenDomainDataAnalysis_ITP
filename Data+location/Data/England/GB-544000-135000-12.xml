		<content>   In local times a British hill fort  
 was in the village.The Romans built a 
 road through our area from Lewes to   
 London in order to serve local iron   
 workings.Last year we looked at a     
 Roman pottery found in the village.   
 English kings used the forest to hunt 
 deer.John of Gaunt and Henry the      
 eighth hunted here.Iron workings were 
 resumed in Tudor times making         
 Hartfield important. In those days    
 there were 3 corn water mills,2       
 survive today.Bolebroke Castle is     
 reputed to be the oldest brick        
 building in Ssussex.                  
   In modern times A.A.Milne lived in  
 Cotchford Lane and the 500 acre wood  
 and Ashdown Forest are the setting for
 the 'Winnie the Pooh' stories, on of  
 the foot paths crosses Pooh Bridge.   
   There are many old buildings in the 
 centre of Hartfield, 300 yrs. old.    </content>
