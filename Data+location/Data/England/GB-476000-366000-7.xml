		<title>07Guinea fowl</title>
		<content>   A recent addition to the farmyard   
 animals in the area is the{Guinea     
{fowl.}They are bred for their{meat,   
 which has a darker appearance than the
 usual chicken, either fresh or        
 frozen,and a stronger flavour. Their  
{eggs,}though smaller than a chicken's,
 have a comparatively large yolk, so   
 make an attractive and economical buy 
 for the shopper.                      
   They are never reared in large      
 numbers because of their fairly wild  
 nature, and they roost in trees. If   
 they could be bred in intensive       
 conditions, there would probably be a 
 reasonable hotel trade for such birds.
   We found the Guinea fowl wandering  
 freely within the environment of the  
 farm which breeds them, and they      
 caused not a little inconvenience to  
 the motorist as they wandered along   
 the roads.                            </content>
