		<title>03Cattle Farming on Horse-Eye</title>
		<content> On Horse-Eye Level one of the 2 main  
 types of animal farming is the cattle.
 The cattle grazed on the marsh are the
 Belted Galloway, Charolais &amp;          
 Friesians. Friesians are milked both  
 in the morning and evening as well as 
 farmed for their beef. The Belted     
 Galloway &amp; the Charolais are not      
 milked &amp; only farmed for their beef.  
 The beef calves often run in the      
 fields with the cows. The fields      
 occupied by the cattle are sometimes  
 separated by dykes - water ditches -  
 instead of hedges or fences. In       
 exceptionally dry weather, the dykes  
 dry up allowing the cattle to escape. 
 The cattle are expected to remain on  
 the marsh in most weather conditions, 
 although if too cold or wet they would
 be taken in. There does not appear to 
 be any intensive feeding of the cattle
 in this area.                         </content>
