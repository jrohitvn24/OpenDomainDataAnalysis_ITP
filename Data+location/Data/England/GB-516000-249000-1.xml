		<title>01THE SANDY AREA</title>
		<content>   SANDY IS A PLEASANT BEDFORDSHIRE    
 TOWN WITH A POPULATION OF             
 APPROXIMATELY 8,000 AND IS SITUATED 48
 MILES NORTH OF LONDON, 9 MILES EAST OF
 BEDFORD AND 22 MILES WEST OF          
 CAMBRIDGE. ACCESS BY ROAD IS GOOD AS  
 JUST WEST OF THE TOWN RUNS THE A1.    
 RAIL COMMUNICATIONS ARE ALSO GOOD AND 
 THERE ARE SERVICES TO STEVENAGE,      
 LONDON AND PETERBOROUGH.              
   SANDY TOWN CENTRE OFFERS ALL        
 ESSENTIAL SHOPPING FACILITIES AND     
 THERE IS A WEEKLY MARKET.             
   THE SOIL AROUND SANDY IS VERY       
 FERTILE AND BECAUSE OF THIS MARKET    
 GARDENING IS AN IMPORTANT LOCAL       
 ACTIVITY. IN RECENT YEARS THE AREA HAS
 ATTRACTED A FAIR AMOUNT OF LIGHT      
 INDUSTRY ALTHOUGH SANDY STILL RETAINS 
 THE ATMOSPHERE OF A COUNTRY TOWN, THE 
 SURROUNDING AREA BEING ALMOST ENTIRELY
 AGRICULTURAL.                         </content>
