		<title>13DOG BREEDING</title>
		<content> We visited some kenels called{        
{Portmans Hay Rodley Kennels.}They have
 got 20 dogs at the moment.The dogs are
{Cairn Terriers} and sell for Â£120     
 each. They sell very quickly. The big 
 dogs are fed on 1 pound of meat and   
 biscuits and the small dogs on 6      
 ounces of meat and biscuits a day.    
 At{Cleeve Bungalow}they have got 30   
 dogs. They are all{Greyhounds}.The    
 kennel has been open for 16 years and 
 the lady in charge started by getting 
 dogs from Ireland.                    
 The dogs cost Â£7 a week to keep and   
 they are fed twice a day if they are {
{racing dogs} and four times a day if  
 they are puppies.                     
 The dogs are raced all over the       
 country and are not for sale although 
 they are bred at the kennels.
