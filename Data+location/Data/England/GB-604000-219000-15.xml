		<title>15Arts and Crafts in Alresford</title>
		<content> There are very few arts and crafts    
 facilities in Alresford, although many
 local residents are keen painters,    
 potters and sculptors. People from the
 village tend to travel in to Wivenhoe 
 or Colchester to attend art and       
 pottery classes.                      
  Wivenhoe, a village similar in site  
 to Alresford is about 1 mile          
 away.  Several artists live there and 
 there are day evening classes held    
 regulary throughout the year where    
 people may learn about many different 
 decorative arts and crafts.  Alresford
 residents attend either these, or     
 similar classes held in Colchester, at
 Adult Education Centres.              
  The only recreational building in    
 Alresford is the village hall and     
 there are no art or craft type classes
 held there, although there is a weekly
 keep fit class.                       </content>
