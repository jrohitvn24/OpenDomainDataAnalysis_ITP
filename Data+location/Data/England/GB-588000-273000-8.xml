		<title>08The River Black Bourn</title>
		<content>The River Black Bourn runs through the 
farmland to the East of the village.   
Near the old Watermill is a ford now   
accompanied by a nearby light bridge.  
There were a lot of reeds by the side  
and in the middle of the river. About a
foot away from the river's edge was a  
big patch of nettles which stretched as
far as I could see. A little way up    
the river were some water lilies in    
flower. On one of the sides of the     
river was a sort of dock-leaved plant. 
On the other side of the river was a   
mill pond. The mill pond had dried up  
into marsh land, and lots of weeds are 
growing there now. On our walk today   
on high ground North of Honington I    
did not find any proper rivers but I   
did find a concrete filled ditch, a    
polluted ditch, and a  big duck-pond.
