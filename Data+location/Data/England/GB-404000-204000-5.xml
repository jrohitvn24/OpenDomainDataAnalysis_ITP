		<content> Elizabeth,the older,died on Jan 18th  
 and her brother died on Jan 10th. Each
 one was buried the day after their    
 death. There is a memorial to their   
 mother, Elizabeth, who died the       
 following year aged 22. Her husband's 
 name is Brereton Bourchier Esquire and
 on his wife's Latin memorial he is    
 called an 'armiger'. The name is also 
 seen on a tablet to Sarah Bowchier,   
 daughter of Robert Brereton of        
 Cirencester, who died in 1762 aged 93.
                                       
    Another local family, which used to
 own Barnsley Park, is the             
 Wykeham-Musgraves. There is an        
 enclosure in the churchyard, which is 
 full of their graves, dating from 1770
 to 1980. They also owned Thame Park in
 Oxfordshire. Mr. Wykeham-Musgrave     
 still lives in the village.
