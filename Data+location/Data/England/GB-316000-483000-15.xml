		<title>15FARM SURVEY, THWAITES (1)</title>
		<content> We composed a farm questionnaire      
 and interviewed 10 farmers.           
 We found that 80% of the farmers own  
 their own farm. The largest farm is   
 272 acres and the smallest is 50      
 acres. The average size is 151 acres. 
 90% of the farms have some rough      
 pasture. The amount varies from 18% to
 100% of the total acreage with 60     
 acres being the average per farm. 80% 
 of the farms have no employed helpers.
 50% of the farms deal mostly in fat   
 stock (both sheep and cattle ),20% in 
 dairy cows and sheep, 20% deal almost 
 entirely in sheep and 10% are dairy   
 farms. All the farms keep at least    
 some sheep.                           
 None of the farms are arable. In fact 
 very few crops are grown and those    
 which are, are for the farmers own    
 use. (Continued on page 20.)
