		<title>01Marham - a Norfolk Village</title>
		<content> Marham, formerly Cherry Marham, lies  
 at the bottom of a chalk enscarpment  
 running into peat clay fenland to the 
 North-west, and sandy loam to the     
 south-east.  It gives rise to several 
 natural springs which are pumped by   
 the A.W.A. in a station at the centre 
 of the village.  The land is mainly   
 agricultural, engaged in mixed, cattle
 and dairy farming but with some small 
 woods, which are mainly deciduous.  A 
 few people work in agriculture, and   
 the balance commute to the R.A.F.     
 Station or the local towns.  There are
 two small factories, one electrical,  
 and the other a carrot processing     
 station.  The Norman Church is        
 dedicated to the Holy Trinity. The    
 present houses are built of brick and 
 they are mainly of modern construction
 there being 50% bungalows in the      
 village.                              </content>
