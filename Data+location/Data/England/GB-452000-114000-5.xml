		<content> Pasture management begins in March    
 after the early Spring weathering has 
 broken up the soil.Before sowing,     
 compound fertilisers are used at the  
 rate of 2.5 cwt per acre, and also 35%
 nitrogen at the rate of 2cwt per acre.
 Weeding continues until silage is cut 
 in May. During June, the hay is cut   
 and more fertiliser applied for       
 extended growth and Summer grazing.   
 Maize is sown in late March once the  
 soil has been prepared by ploughing,  
 and the application of fertiliser and 
 a pre-emergent weedkiller spray.      
 Usually 45,000 seeds germinate from   
 47,000 sown. Harvesting takes place in
 September and it is used for silage   
 and quick fattening before slaughter. 
 During October, hedge-cutting is      
 carried out along with any meadow     
 reseeding. Straw is brought in for    
 feed and bedding.                     </content>
