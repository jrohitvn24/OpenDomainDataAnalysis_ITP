		<content> going to visit a farm called          
 "Sunnyside". We were met by the       
 farmer, Mr Allen, who was kind enough 
 to answer all our questions. On the   
 farm we saw cows, chickens and pigs   
 who would not come out of their sty.  
 We were able to stroke the cows and   
 one of them licked my hand. It's      
 tongue was very rough! Back at school 
 it was time for dinner which was roast
 beef,roast potatoes, cabbage and      
 carrots. Back in class at 13.15 we did
 some reading and then we went to the  
 hall for Country Dancing followed by  
 BAGA practice for the May Fete. When  
 school ended I went home, got my bike 
 and rode to Mrs Diver's house were my 
 mother was. I played with my friend   
 Louise until it was tea time. Half-an-
 hour piano lesson followed and then I 
 watched TV until 20.00 when I washed  
 and went to bed.                      </content>
