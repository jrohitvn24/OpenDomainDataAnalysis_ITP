		<content>At Collier St. fete people who lived in
our area also told us the activities   
they enjoyed in other places: sailing  
on Bewl Bridge reservoir; golf at      
Cranbrook; motor racing at Brans Hatch 
and a craft centre for the disabled at 
Yalding.                               
 A gardening club has recently been    
started in our area. They hope to meet 
monthly. Most people in our area have a
freezer for local produce as well as   
the fruit &amp; vegetables they grow       
themselves. One lady told us what she  
grew in her garden."I grow raspberries,
potatoes, onions, carrots, parsley,    
parsnips, cabbages, cauliflowers,      
brussels sprouts and this year I am    
trying to grow garlic. As a result of  
the produce stall I had at the fete I  
now have a herb garden! People are     
really going in for old fashioned roses
and herbs again in the village."       </content>
