 Then we have tea.After tea I either

 As I live in another village I go to  
 school on a bus.The bus picks me up at
 08.10 each morning and if I am to     
 catch the bus I must be ready to leave
 home at 08.00.I get up at 07.00.My mum
 is up before this and she prepares my 
 breakfast and packs my school bag.I   
 arrive at school at 08.30 and spend   
 the time before school starts playing 
 and chatting with my friends.After    
 school I arrive home at about 16.30.  
 The T.V.usually goes straight on when 
 I have put away my bag and coat.      </content>
