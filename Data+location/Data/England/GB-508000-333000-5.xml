		<content> Until 1959 Billingborough had a       
 railway station. We now have 5 bus    
 services which go to our nearest towns
 -Bourne,Boston,Grantham,Sleaford and  
 Spalding.Most of these services run on
 the towns' market days and there are  
 no buses on Sundays. Residents of     
 outlying hamlets such as Stow and     
 Birthorpe have to come into           
 Billingborough to catch the buses.    
 Some of the bus routes go through     
 Horbling but the people have to walk  
 to Billingborough to catch those which
 do not.                               
  Most people find it more convenient  
 to have their own cars as the buses   
 are infrequent.
