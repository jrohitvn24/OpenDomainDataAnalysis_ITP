 early, but when we do get up we go    
 downstairs and help cook the          
 breakfast. After{breakfast}we have a  
 wash and then we get dressed. Then we 
 tidy up our rooms.                    
 At 11.30 we get into the car and drive
 to West Horsely where we pick up my

 upstairs and has a rest. While she is 
 resting we do the washing up and then
