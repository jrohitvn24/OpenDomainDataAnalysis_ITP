		<title>12OLDER CHILDREN'S HOBBIES</title>
		<content>    My hobby is keeping rats and I have
 4 of them. They are very clean and    
 intelligent animals. I call one of    
 them Budgie because when I feed her   
 she sits on my finger. The more you   
 handle them the tamer they become.    
 They never bite if they have been     
 hand-reared.                          
{   My hobby is collecting scented     
{rubbers. I have over 50 and nearly all
{of them have a fruity smell. My       
{favourite one is a yellow frog with   
{green feet. They cost between 10p and 
{60p from stationery shops. Most of my 
{rubbers are made in Taiwan and Japan. 
    I have been playing Subbuteo since 
 I was 7. I have 63 teams and a lot of 
 accessories which include terraces,   
 camera men and outside T.V. units,    
 extra goals, cups, to name but a few. 
 Subbuteo is a very interesting game   
 which has been going since 1947.      </content>
