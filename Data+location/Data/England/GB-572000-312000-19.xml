		<title>19TRANSPORT Pentney &amp; Narboro'</title>
		<content> Less public transport exists in the   
 area now than formerly, the railway   
 discontinued in 1968 and less buses   
 run. Thus all age groups rely more    
 upon cars, motorcycles and bicycles.  
 This poses a problem for two different
 age groups; the elderly who once owned
 a car but due to changed circumstances
 now find it necessary to rely on      
 public transport. The other group are 
 the young workers who are unable to   
 afford their own transport.           
 The A47, the main trunk road through  
 the area, is in reasonable condition  
 but the byroads leave much to be      
 desired. Sharp bends on the A47 at    
 Narborough and heavy traffic, often   
 moving too fast, have resulted in many
 accidents over the years. A By Pass   
 has long been talked about but despite
 an official inquiry, no definite route
 has yet been planned.                 </content>
