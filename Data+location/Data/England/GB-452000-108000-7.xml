		<content> Mr Houghton owns 4 farms, Webbs land, 
 Park Place, Cold Harbour and Wickham. 
 Cold Harbour Farm is the only one in  
 our grid square.  We interviewed Mr   
 Houghton about this farm.             
    This farm consists of beef cattle, 
 which are bought at eight months,     
 fattened up and slaughtered at        
 Wimborne.  Cattle have their morning  
 feed on a regular basis which is at   
 7.30 a.m. and another feed later in   
 the day.  They must also have dry     
 straw and plenty of water.            
    The crop rotation is a 4 year one, 
 a mixture of grass and arable.  Two   
 crops of wheat are grown, one of peas 
 and one of barley and then the field  
 is returned to pasture.  These crops  
 have to be fertilised with nitrogen,  
 potash and lime and sprayed with      
 pesticides, the turning of this is    
 governed by weather and season.       </content>
