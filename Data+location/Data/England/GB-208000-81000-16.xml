		<content>  Then a shocked Mr Perry found himself
 flying through the air as the bull    
 tossed him ten feet into the River    
 Camel.                                
  Mr. Perry aged 56 and last year's    
 Mayor of Camelford  said              
 afterwards,"It followed me into the   
 river,and there was a ten foot bank on
 the other side and as I climbed up the
 other side I had never moved faster in
 my life."                             
                                       
                                       
         House Prices                  
 Most houses are in the price range of 
 Â£15,000 for an old cottage to Â£40,000 
 for a new house.                      
 New houses are the more popular out of
 the two, because many of the old      
 cottages are being knocked down in    
 this area.
