		<content> The dominant feature of the area is   
 Sandown Bay which offers safe, sandy  
 beaches and a wide range of water     
 sport facilities. There are two piers,
 Sandown and Shanklin some two miles   
 apart. Sandown is council owned and   
 boasts a modern 900 seater theatre    
 which offers 'big name' variety shows.
 Shanklin is privately owned and offers
 discos,slot machines and deckchairs.  
 The two towns,which are major resorts 
 extend along the coastal strip and    
 meet at the village of Lake forming a 
 linear conurbation dividing sea from  
 farm land. Employment,other than      
 tourism,is provided by                
 shops,residential old peoples homes,a 
 very large air conditioning factory   
 and a few small electronic component  
 firms.
