		<title>02Coln St. Aldwyns</title>
		<content>  {Coln St.Aldwyns}is a picturesque    
 Cotswold village.In the village there 
 is a shop, a post office, a public    
 house and about forty houses.         
  The houses are traditional in design 
 made from stone and roofed with       
 stone.Some of them were built in the  
 16th century.                         
 Coln lies on Akeman Street, a Roman   
 road. There are indications that a    
 community flourished in Coln during   
 Roman times; Roman coins have been    
 found regularly and there are traces  
 of the foundations of a villa.        
   Sadly there are very few children in
 Coln for the houses here are very     
 expensive and cannot be afforded by   
 families with young children.Some of  
 the houses are only used at weekends.
