		<title>07The Bad Harvest</title>
		<content> The weather this summer has been so   
 wet that all the farmers in this area,
 including my grandad have had         
 difficulty getting their hay in.  My  
 grandad thinks that this summer has   
 been the worst he has ever had for    
 harvesting.  The hay was rotting on   
 the ground, and the grain was overipe 
 and not the best quality, even if it  
 could be gathered in, as  lot of it   
 was flat on the ground, due to heavy  
 rain and storng winds.  It will cost  
 my grandad more money this winter to  
 feed his stock, s he will have to buy 
 more hay, to feed them when they are  
 inside in the cold winter.            
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
