		<title>03Farming at Old Lodge</title>
		<content>   Mr.and Mrs.Hill live in a brick and 
 sandstone farmhouse built about 1600. 
 It has five bedrooms and used to be a 
 hunting lodge on the Craven estate.   
 A barn has roof timbers from an old   
 sailing ship and the bricks in the    
 house and barn were handmade.         
   Five people work on the farm which  
 has 384 acres in 17 fields. The fields
 have names like-Hogs Norton,Chestnuts,
 Rosey Butchers,Brook Meadow,Long      
 Meadow and Cherry Orchard.            
   The lansdcape is flat, growing      
 wheat,barley,oats,oilseed rape and    
 grass.Bees are kept to pollinate the  
 rape.There used to be some sheep but  
 the farm is too near houses where     
 people keep dogs.There are 4 grain    
 bins holding 90 tons each.There are   
 two dogs,a horse and a pony. There    
 will only be 16 fields when the       
 planned Eastern Bypass is built soon. </content>
