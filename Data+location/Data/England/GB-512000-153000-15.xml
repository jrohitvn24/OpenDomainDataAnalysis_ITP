		<title>15The Bookham Community Assoc.</title>
		<content> The{Bookham Community Association}was 
 formed in 1948 in response to the 1944
 Education Act which urged the forma_  
 tion of centres for adult education   
 and community groups.                 
                                       
 The prime movers in its formation were
 Mr&amp;Mrs Harrison &amp; Dr Waterfield was   
 its 1st President. The acquisition of 
 the Barn Hall enabled the BCA to      
 affiliate village clubs and groups and
 to form its own.                      
                                       
 Some early formations were: the Over  
 60's, Gramophone &amp; Bowling Clubs &amp; the
 Dramatic Society. In 1952, there were 
 20 clubs; in 1985 there are over 60.  
                                       
 The original aims were to allow groups
 and people to meet and to work for the
 improvement of relationships and the  
 general life of the village.          </content>
