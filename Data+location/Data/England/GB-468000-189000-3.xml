		<title>03St.Botolphs Church Swyncombe</title>
		<content>The church is a Norman Pilgrim Church  
dedicated to St. Botolph, the English  
Patron Saint of travellers. It was com-
pleted in 1020 and remains virtually   
unchanged today. It is built from flint
stone laid in a herringbone pattern. On
the South wall is the oldest double    
aumbry in England that is still in use.
The 14th. century bell is preserved in-
side the building. There is 17th. and  
18th. century stained glass with armor-
ial bearings remounted on modern glass.
Work in 1850 restored the original wall
paintings. The original solid stone    
arch with lefthand squint was replaced 
in 1910 by a pine screen. This was     
being changed in 1914 when the work had
to stop due to the internment of the   
donors. Consequently the necessary     
figures are missing. The original rel- 
iquary was uncovered in 1982.
