		<title>14 Whippinham Primary School</title>
		<content>    On Friday 5th of July we visited   
 Whippingham School to find out some   
 interesting facts about the school    
 today compared with what it was like  
 in Victorian times.  Here are our     
 findings.                             
                                       
    Whippingham School was built in    
 1853.  The school has the following   
 rooms: three classrooms, a large hall,
 video, Staff, activity, medical,      
 kitchen, office, book, toilets. The   
 number of children in the school then 
 would have been 50.  Today the school 
 has 46 children on roll. In 1853 you  
 had to pay to go to school.  A        
 committee bought the books and the    
 Head Teachers wife had to get the     
 older girls to clean the classrooms   
 and to make sure that the children    
 were clean and tidy.
