 The main farming activity is sheep    
 farming, the predominant breed being  
 Gritstone x Suffolk.  There is one    
 rare flock of Woodland Whiteface.     
 They graze on rough pasture enclosed  
 by dry stone walling.  The sheep are  
 dipped in the Summer and Autumn,      
 wormed several times in the Summer and
 injected against several major        
 disorders.  Shearing takes place in   
 the Summer and the wool is sold to the
 British Wool Board.                   
 There are also suckler cows and calves
 and a few Friesian dairy cattle.      
 Many farmers find it difficult to make
 a viable living from the farms and    
 have to find additional outside       
 occupations despite government        
 subsidies.
