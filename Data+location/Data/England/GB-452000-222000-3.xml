		<content>    The front of the house faces Home  
Wood,which was planted in the time of  
King John(1201)and recently repurchased
by the Estate.A deer herd roams here.A 
very impressive Cedar tree, purported  
to be the best in the country faces the
front door.The only remaining feature  
of the old house is the carved lion on 
the corner and the original astrolabe  
which was recovered from a garden.A    
copy of this can be seen in Clock      
Court.Today the house has been sublet  
into longterm leases and occupied      
mainly by retired residents.           
    The south facing lawn is occupied  
by a croquet lawn and gardens.         
    This view will be interupted by the
silos of the chicken factory if built.
