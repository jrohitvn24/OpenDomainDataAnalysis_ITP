		<title>10Buxhall - Local Employment</title>
		<content> Within Buxhall there are{3 non-farming
{employers}providing work for 22       
 persons: an{agricultural engineer,    
 boarding and breeding{kennels}and a   
{plastic extrusion}and fabrication     
 business. The latter was established  
 in 1979 on a site outside the village.
 The owners had run a pig unit on the  
 site and wished to diversify.         
 The business originally produced      
 flooring and accessories for animal   
 units but has expanded to include     
 components for the motor industry.    
 Initially the rural location was      
 convenient as much of the market was  
 with local farmers. Subsequently the  
 accessibility of the A45 has          
 facilitated the firms expansion into  
 national and international markets.   
 Works transport is provided to enable 
 employees to travel from Ipswich each 
 day.                                  </content>
