 type"windows add variety to the modern
 streets.This is so on Ploughman       
 Avenue-a cul de sac, next to this are 
 eight such cottages, and next to these
 is a house still under                
 construction!Near Doverbeck Drive is a
 Baptist Church dated 1835.It is small 
 and reminiscent of a cottage.On the   
 outskirts of Woodborough lie the      
 executive bungalows_these expensive   
 bungalows were, in 1986 valued at     
 Â£90,ooo. They are set away from the   
 road with extensive garden space      
{NEW DEVELOPMENTS                      
 Woodborough is expanding and there are
 many "new developments".Broad Close   
 has been constructed within the last  
 year;some houses are finished but some
 are still under construction.Also,on  
 the corner of foxwood lane an old     
 army camp is being made into flats.   </content>
