		<title>20HIGHBRIDGE TOWN</title>
		<content> Highbridge town is really a shadow of 
 its former self.Once it was a big     
 employer of the local men,but now lots
 of the local men are out of work.The  
 original industries of the docks &amp;    
 railways have gone,especially with the
 closing of the locomotive works of the
 S.&amp; D. railway in the 1950's.Most work
 now is in the newer industrial estates
 of Walrow.Many of the original        
 buildings are now abandoned,or used   
 for other purposes.Highbridge is      
 rather a scruffy town with a very busy
 main road,the A 38 running through    
 it.Many of the shops are unused or for
 sale.Very little new building has been
 done recently.There are two quite old 
 council estates in Highbridge.
