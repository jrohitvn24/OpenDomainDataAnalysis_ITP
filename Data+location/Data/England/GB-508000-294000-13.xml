		<title>13LIVING IN ELTON:NORTH/ELTON</title>
		<content> We asked what people saw as the       
 advantages and disadvantages of living
 where they did.                       
                                       
 The overwhelming opinion is that Elton
 is a quiet, beautiful village set in  
 attractive countryside with very      
 friendly inhabitants.   Some people   
 found the lack of shops in the village
 a disadvantage, but the ease of       
 travelling to the large shopping      
 centre in Peterborough was seen to    
 counteract this. Some people found the
 distances they had to travel to work a
 disadvantage, the bus service was seen
 as poor - and others were against any 
 further building expansion.           
                                       
 However, most people could find no    
 disadvantages with their situation.
