		<title>01The Village of Ash.</title>
		<content>   The parish of Ash is situated at the
 extreme west of the county of Surrey. 
 Together, Ash, Ash Vale and Ash Green 
 form the largest village in England.  
   The long ridge of chalk known as the
 Hog's Back lies southward and carries 
 the A.31 London to Winchester.        
   Ash is surrounded by sandy heathland
 and woods of silver birch and fir.    
 Much of this heathland is used by the 
 Army for its Firing Ranges.           
   Many of the Army personnel based at 
 Aldershot 2 miles away live in Ash.   
   The Basingstoke Canal runs through  
 the village and is being restored.    
   A Water Sports Centre has been      
 opened in the disused gravel pits and 
 now provides a large recreation area. 
   Ash has some fine old buildings     
 including two mentioned in the        
 Domesday book - Ash Manor and St      
 Peter's Church.                       </content>
