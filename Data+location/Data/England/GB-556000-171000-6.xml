		<title>06A Teacher's Day</title>
		<content>   I enter the school at five past     
 eight.  I unlock the classroom door   
 and prepare work for the coming day.  
 Preparation includes chalkboard,      
 overhead projector, video and         
 paperwork.  Some marking of books and 
 tidying takes place before school.    
 The duty teacher will blow a whistle  
 for start of school at five to nine.  
 The children walk into class and work 
 on set individual exercises until     
 Assembly.  Afterwards I will teach and
 assist with supervised set subjects   
 until break at half past ten. Break   
 lasts fifteen minutes and lessons     
 continue until 12.00 lunchtime.       
 Afternoon work continues from 1 p.m.  
 to 3.20 during which time practical   
 activities take place.  After school I
 might run a club or attend a staff    
 meeting.
