		<title>13Social Survey.</title>
		<content>  This area has an "easy going" rural  
atmosphere with no notable violence or 
trouble.A recent survey of local       
teenagers showed that most girls smoke 
under age and most boys drink under    
age.Both sexes believe in equal        
opportunities,and would prefer to go to
a comprehensive rather than a private  
school.In this area "classes" range    
from the working class miners to middle
class solicitors and teachers,though   
class friction is almost non-existent. 
  One of the most notable features of  
this area is the extremely low ethnic  
population.This results in a lack of   
racially based problems.               
  In general the  people of the area   
remain in close family units and have a
somewhat insular outlook on life.The   
older generation tend to be traditional
but mix well with the younger          
generation.                            </content>
