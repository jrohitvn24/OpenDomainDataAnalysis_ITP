 70m N.E. of castle are mounds 18m in  
 diameter plus a ridge - the outline of
 the former college buildings.         
                                       
 There is a sandstone monument on the  
 side of the Duke of Suffolk's Oak     
 blown down in 1891. This commemorates 
 the site of the oak where the Duke of 
 Suffolk (father of Lady Jane Grey) hid
 following his rebellion against Mary  
 Tudor and where he was captured.
