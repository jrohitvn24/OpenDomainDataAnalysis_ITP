 swimming pool, which is situated in   
 Filton, just off the A38-Gloucester

 schools using it during school time,  
 having 10 lessons each day.  The pool 
 is 25 metres long by 10 metres wide,  
 sloping from 3 feet at the shallow end
 to 6 feet at the deep end.  The water 
 is drained and filtered at a rate of  
 2,200 gallons per hour, and twice a   
 week 2,000 gallons are removed and    
 replaced.
