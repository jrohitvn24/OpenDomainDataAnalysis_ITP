		<content> The main A4129 crosses the area       
 diagonally from North West to South   
 East.  In the South East corner this  
 is joined by the B4009 which runs     
 along the route of the Lower Icknield 
 Way, a roman road, which was the      
 ancient track parallel to the Chiltern
 escarpment along the edge of the clay.
 The whole area is criss-crossed by    
 footpaths and bridle ways.            
                                       
 Transport.  Public transport is very  
 sparse in this area.  There is a bus  
 to Thame and back on Market days      
 (Tuesdays) and to Aylesbury and back  
 on Wednesdays Fridays when it is      
 market day there.  The nearest station
 is Princes Risborough.  The Paddington
 to Birmingham railway line cuts the   
 area diagonally.  The southern line   
 across the S.W. corner is now only    
 used to supply the Thame Petrol Depot.</content>
