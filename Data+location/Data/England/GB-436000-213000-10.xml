		<title>10A Station Sergeant's life</title>
		<content>A Sergeant begins work at 2.00 at the  
police station. He gets to work at 1.45
and takes over from the early turn     
sergeant,who tells him how many        
prisoners there are and have they been 
fed etc.A little old lady comes into   
the police station with a huge dog on a
lead saying she found it straying near 
her house. The Sergeant takes it from  
her and puts it in to the police       
station yard and aranges for a P.C. to 
take it to the dogs home.Lots of things
are reported lost and found,such as    
spectacles, watches, umbrellas, money  
etc.Other things a sergeant deals with 
are people being involved in traffic   
accidents, disturbances on the         
street,in restaurants and cafes,public 
houses and other public places.At 6.00 
he has his tea and at 10.00 he goes    
home.      by Nicola Vivienne Baker.
