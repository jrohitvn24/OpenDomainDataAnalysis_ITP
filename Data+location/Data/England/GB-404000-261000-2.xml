		<title>02A WALK NEAR ASTWOOD BANK-1</title>
		<content> The  walk starts at the Ridgeway      
 Middle School and goes down Edgioake  
 Lane.There is a fence on one side of  
 the road and a public footpath.It is  
 muddy and you come out into a fruit   
 field.This is quite a large field,but 
 you soon come to the next.This is a   
 grass field for grazing and so is the 
 next.In the next field there is a line
 of elm trees which run down to the    
 road.Looking westwards you can see for
 80 miles.                             
 The Ridgeway was a horse track and was
 very dangerous because robbers used to
 live in the forest and robbed the     
 people.                               
 The houses are in a ribbon development
 along the ridge.Many of the hedges in 
 this area are over 400 years old.
