		<content>The present home of Morecambe Golf Club
is situated between Happy Mount Park   
and Hest Bank along Coastal Road       
adjacent to Morecambe Bay and          
overlooked by the Lakeland Hills.The   
railway line from London to Glasgow    
runs behind the course.Although the    
present course has undergone all sorts 
of rearrangements in its 50 odd years  
of existance,it has never lost its     
reputation of being an interesting     
course with a sound test of            
play.Alterations to the club have      
produced a modern building.The men's   
captain is M.B.Price and the captain   
for the ladies is Mrs D. Hartly.It     
is an 18 hole course.The golf shop     
sells golf shoes,golf balls and        
other golf equipment.
