		<content>      Most of this block of land is    
 agricultural land, mainly arable with 
 some grassland and four areas of      
 woodland.  There is only one area of  
 population of any size and that is in 
 the village of Haselor.  Haselor is a 
 small village in Warwickshire situated
 about seven miles from Stratford-Upon 
 -Avon and about three from Alcester.  
      The private houses in Haselor are
 generally well sought after by middle 
 class people commuting mainly to      
 Birmingham, Redditch or Stratford for 
 their work.  There is a handful of    
 council houses and some tied cottages/
 houses.  There is a wide variety of   
 styles and ages among the houses.
