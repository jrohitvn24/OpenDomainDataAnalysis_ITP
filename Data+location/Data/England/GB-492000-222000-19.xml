		<title>19BILLINGTON TODDLER CLUB</title>
		<content>  The recently formed Mother and       
 Toddlers Group is held in the village 
 hall on Wednesday mornings from 10-12.
 The group was started because there   
 was not sufficient young children for 
 the playgroup to continue, but the    
 village people wanted to keep this    
 option open for the future.           
  The mothers are able to meet, have   
 coffee and chat in a relaxed          
 atmosphere while their children are   
 playing. This appears to be the only  
 place where the young mums are able to
 meet on a regular basis and they say  
 that it gets themselves and their     
 children out of the house.            
  The children seem to enjoy playing in
 the large hall where there is a Wendy 
 House, tricycles and many other toys. 
 They also have the security of        
 knowing that their mothers are there  
 if they need them.                    </content>
