inbetween C.S.P and Gerrards X.It was  
built in the 1930's.The owners of the  
house have lived there for 10 years.The
house and garden cover one third of an 
acre in size.The house is situated near
the M25,Denham Aerodrome,and the old   
main road.The owners and their family  
enjoy all the amenities of the area.   
                                       
   The road at the back of the garden  
does not bother them.The only thing    
that bothers them are the planes that  
fly overhead from the aerodrome.The    
house has always been called "The      
Dormers".They have planning permission 
to build a house at the bottom of the  
garden.The father of the family is a   
doctor in Uxbridge,whilst the mother is
a nightnurse.They have a comfortable   
lifestyle and enjoy living in Gerrards 
Cross.                                 </content>
