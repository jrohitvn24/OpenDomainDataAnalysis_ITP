 The manor is beautifully made. The    
 front is 13th century.It is made of   
 stone and has old wooden doors.Most of
 the windows are arched but at the     
 front wall there are large windows.The
 manor has some fancy stone work and on
 one of the walls there is a wooden    
 cross.The avenue where the manor      
 stands used to be an old dirt track   
 until 17 years ago now there are new  
 houses. There is a passage from the   
 manor to the church.{                 
{STANWICK CHURCH.                      
 The church is the only building in the
 village from the Middle Ages.The      
 church is Norman and it was dedicated 
 to St.Lawrence.The church has been    
 rebuilt once in the 13th century. The 
 tower is the best feature.
