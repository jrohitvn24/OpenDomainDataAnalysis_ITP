		<content> Footpaths and quiet lanes provide     
 opportunities for rambling. Bridle    
 paths and bye-ways allow people to    
 participate in horse riding. There are
 plenty of open spaces for flying      
 powered model aeroplanes and a few    
 people have been observed hang        
 gliding. It is a good area for        
 ornithologists and botanists. The     
 Derbyshire Naturalists' Trust have two
 reserves in the area, access to which 
 requires identity of membership or a  
 permit. Peace and beauty abound to be 
 enjoyed by all.                       
{LIFE STYLES:-}an aerial mast erected  
 in the vicinity of Peasunhurst is for 
 the benefit of lorrydrivers. Those    
 living in the area pursue such        
 activities as horse riding, gardening,
 bee keeping, embroidery, reading, and 
 television viewing.
