		<title>15HACKENSALL FARM</title>
		<content>   The Baines family first came to live
 in Knott End in 1925 when Mr Baines'  
 uncle found some Roman coins on the   
 golf links. Since then the family has 
 lived at Hackensall Farm and also owns
 New Heys Farm, S.E. of Knott End. The 
 farm consists of 200 acres, with 44%  
 acreage of corn. They grow barley and 
 grass and have 60 milk calves and 90  
 beef calves. The feed merchants buy   
 their crops but in the winter they    
 feed all their own animals. Machinery 
 consists of milking machine, ploughs, 
 2 tractors, harrows, seed drills, a   
 combine harvester and manure spreader.
 The trees round the farm used to have 
 lumps on the bark, but when the power 
 station was closed down the lumps     
 disappeared.The barn, once a chapel,  
 now has a barn owl! Michael, a friend,
 rings bluetits and chaffinches and    
 builds nesting-boxes in the woods.    </content>
