		<title>17WILLEN CHURCH MILTON KEYNES</title>
		<content> Willen Church was built in 1680 by    
 Robert Hooke. He named the church ST  
 Mary Magdalene. The church stands on  
 small mound opposite Willen           
 Priory.Inside the church is a marble  
 font with a hand carved oak cover into
 it. The outside of the church is black
 and red brick with limestone dressing.
 The church does have a belltower,with 
 three bells in it. The grounds of the 
 church are not very big, but they     
 contain quite a lot of graves, neatly 
 taken care of. The oldest gravestone  
 there is dated 1672. There is a long  
 gravel pathway leading up to the      
 church. On either side of the path are
 trees and bushes.
