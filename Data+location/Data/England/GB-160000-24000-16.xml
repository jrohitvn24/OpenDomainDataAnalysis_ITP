		<title>16THE PENROSE ESTATE</title>
		<content>    Penrose Estate is owned by the     
 National Trust, but Mr. and Mrs.      
 Rogers, who live in the very old      
 house, look after it. The house, and  
 the gardens in which there are exotic 
 plants and rhododendrons planted by   
 the original owners, are not open to  
 the public. There are many trees on   
 the estate such as horsechestnut and  
 sycamore. Work was carried out by the 
 Manpower Services who made new seats  
 and new walks through the woods.      
 Penrose walk starts at Helston and    
 finishes at Loe Pool two or three     
 miles away, which is part of the      
 estate.                               
    Many people enjoy the wild life and
 peacefulness of all seasons. Rare     
 birds are known to migrate to the     
 estate during winter. Sometimes horse 
 trials are held in the grounds. It is 
 a well known local attraction.        </content>
