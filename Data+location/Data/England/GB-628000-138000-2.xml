		<title>02THE CROSS CHANNEL TUNNEL</title>
		<content> One of the proposed ideas for the     
 Cross Channel Tunnel is two tunnels,  
 each seven metres in diameter.The     
 tunnels will have a cross pass every  
 five hundred metres.They will be built
 forty metres below sea level and      
 through the lower chalk which is      
 impervious to water.                  
                                       
 There will hopefully be two ways to   
 travel,one by a shuttle service of    
 'coaches' which would be able to carry
 cars,coaches and lorries.These would  
 be brightly lit and air conditioned.  
 You would be able to stay in your     
 vehicle or stand beside it.Another way
 would be by train.The shuttle would   
 take thirty minutes and would have a  
 five minute interval between each.
