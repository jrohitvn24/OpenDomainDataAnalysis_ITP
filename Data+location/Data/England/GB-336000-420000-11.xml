		<title>11WORK OF BANKS PARISH COUNCIL</title>
		<content>THE POPULATION OF BANKS IS ABOUT 3,000 
PEOPLE.THE CHAIRMAN OF THE PARISH      
COUNCIL WOULD LIKE TO SEE IT GROW MORE.
 NONE OF THE MEMBERS OF THE PARISH     
COUNCIL RECEIVE PAYMENT FOR THEIR WORK 
BECAUSE IT IS VOLUNTARY.               
 TWO MAJOR DEVELOPMENTS WHICH THE CHAIR
MAN WOULD LIKE TO SEE IN THE VILLAGE   
ARE A LIBRARY AND ANOTHER PLAYING FIELD
FOR RECREATION.AT PRESENT BANKS,LIKE   
THE NEARBY VILLAGES,HAS ONLY A MOBILE  
LIBRARY VAN WHICH COMES FORTNIGHTLY.   
 THERE IS NOW A HEALTH CENTRE IN BANKS 
WHICH IS VERY HELPFUL.THE COUNCIL HAS  
RESPONSIBILITY FOR HELPING PEOPLE AND  
CARING FOR THE COMMUNITY.IF REPAIRS    
NEED CARRYING OUT THEY NOTIFY THE      
DISTRICT COUNCIL. THEY ALSO TAKE PART  
IN DISCUSSIONS ABOUT BUILDING AND      
PLANNING IN BANKS.
