		<title>15ATTITUDES IN HINXWORTH</title>
		<content> A TEENAGER'S VIEW:These villages are  
 very picturesque but they offer       
 nothing for the teenage population -  
 all 6 of us! There are no discos or   
 evening classes and to have any       
 entertainment one has to go to the    
 nearest town 6 miles away usually     
 taken &amp; collected by parents. The     
 compensations are plenty of baby-     
 sitting for pocket money, knowing     
 everybody, no factories, no pollution 
 except the odd farm smell!            
 HOUSEWIFE:This is an ideal environment
 in which to bring up children; it is  
 peaceful and quiet and well away from 
 the temptations of the towns. The     
 major drawback is that transport is   
 absolutely essential, but that apart  
 it is a friendly and caring community.
 WORKING ADULT:The disadvantage is hav-
 ing to commute but the advantages of  
 living in the country outweigh this.  </content>
