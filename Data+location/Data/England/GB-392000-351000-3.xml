		<title>03Well Dressing Queen 1985.</title>
		<content>    My dress had four lace tiers and it
was made of cream satin.The boys in my 
retinue wore green velvet trousers,a   
frilly shirt and a green velvet        
waistcoat with gold painted buttons.   
    At the church service the Vicar    
gave me a lovely inscribed Bible to    
mark the occasion.At the Well I was    
given a drink of water from a goblet.A 
local newspaper photographer took some 
pictures of the events.On the field we 
had the crowning ceremony then we      
watched the Maypole dancing.At the fair
I went on the Scrambler and the Dodgem 
Cars.I also won a goldfish.            
    On the Sunday we were invited to   
the Methodist Church where I was       
presented with a prayer book and we    
sang hymns.I enjoyed being the Queen   
but I was disappointed when it rained  
heavily on the Monday and many of the  
planned events had to be cancelled.    </content>
