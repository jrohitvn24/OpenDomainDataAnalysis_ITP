		<title>10MEDIA. NORTH CREAKE</title>
		<content> Apart from the normal use of radio and
 television, the main sources of news  
 in N Creake, are the London and local 
 newspapers.                           
 These are collected from Kings Lynn,  
 and distributed each morning on       
 regular rounds.  No supply is         
 available for casual customers.       
 Two free advertising newspapers, from 
 Norwich and Peterborough are          
 distributed by school children.  A    
 free-lance journalist lives in the    
 village, and a news photographer from 
 Burnham Market, covers local events.  
 The Creake's News-sheet is distributed
 quarterly, free, in North and South   
 Creake; listing forthcoming events,   
 and regular fixtures.  It is financed 
 by income from the advertising of     
 local traders.
