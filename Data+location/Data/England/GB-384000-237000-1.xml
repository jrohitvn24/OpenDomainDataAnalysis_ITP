		<title>01SEVERN VALE EAST OF MALVERNS</title>
		<content> Part of a prosperous valley of the    
 River Severn lying south of the small 
 but ancient town of Upton-Upon-Severn.
 New building technicques have allowed 
 residential buildings on land         
 previously subjected to flooding.     
 Apart from the established farmers who
 mostly have milking herds, the varied 
 working population go to their places 
 of employment mainly by private car in
 various towns such as Worcester,      
 Pershore, Gloucester, Tewkesbury,     
 Cheltenham and Malvern, which radiate 
 like spokes in a wheel. The beauty    
 and tranquility of the area attracts  
 holidaymaking to the river and        
 countryside. The advantages of the    
 Malvern Hills lying some eight miles  
 away are fully appreciated. Many      
 professional people have contributed  
 to a recognition of its qualities by  
 retiring to the district.             </content>
