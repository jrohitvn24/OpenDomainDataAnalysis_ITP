		<title>16Wittersham Church &amp; School</title>
		<content>  {Wittersham Church}is dedicated to   
 St.John the Baptist and there was     
 probably an Anglo-Saxon wooden church 
 here.  The surviving base of the      
 church dates from around 1200 and the 
 South aisle was built in the early    
 14th century.  The bell tower was     
 added about a hundred years later and 
 houses a ring of bells. The newest    
 addition, the Tower Room, built for   
 small meetings, was dedicated in 1978.
  {The Primary School}was opened on    
 28th October 1874.  The Hall and      
 Television Room are the oldest parts  
 of the building but there are 3 modern
 classrooms built about 28 years ago   
 and a mobile classroom.  We think     
 we have the best Primary School       
 swimming pool in Kent built for us by 
 the P.T.A. There are 84 children in   
 the school aged between 5 and 11 and  
 there are 4 teachers.                 </content>
