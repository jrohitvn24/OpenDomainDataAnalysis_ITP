		<title>17PETERSFIELD MUSICAL FESTIVAL</title>
		<content> Petersfield Musical Festival started  
 in 1901. It was one of the first      
 choral festivals, and takes place each
 year in March in Petersfield Festival 
 Hall. There are concerts by adult and 
 school choirs and orchestras. Up to   
 200 singers may take part, coming from
 as far as Southampton, Hayling Island 
 and Whitchurch. The big choirs sing   
 works like Bach's Mass in B minor and 
 Tippet's "A Child of our Time".       
 Smaller choirs sing things like Bach's
 St.John Passion and the l2th Mass by  
 Mozart.  Ladies choirs have           
 competitions during the day and sing  
 together in a concert in the evening. 
 This year they sang "Sea-scapes" by   
 Judith Bailey, a local composer, and  
 recently sang "Mrs. Beeton's Book" by 
 Michael Hurd, who also lives locally.
