		<title>14FARMING IN HARNHILL (CONT)</title>
		<content> In addition to the organically grown  
 milling wheat, Mr Henly has also grown
 Lucerne for the last three years. In  
 the organic context, Lucerne, which is
 legume, is self-sufficient for        
 nitrogenous plant food supplies and   
 does not require applications of      
 chemical nitrogen.Provided            
 non-chemical supplies of abundant     
 quantities of both phosphate and      
 potassium can be applied to the       
 Lucerne crop it will act as a         
 precursor crop for organically grown  
 Winter Wheat. Additionally, the       
 Lucerne crop does well in dry summers 
 and on the alkaline brash soil at     
 Harnhill, when grass yields can       
 decline dramatically. This practice of
 using Lucerne as the main forage crop 
 to supply the sheep and pave the way  
 for organically grown wheat is still  
 under test at Harnhill.               </content>
