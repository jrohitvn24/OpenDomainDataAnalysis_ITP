		<title>09THE JAMEA MOSQUE, PRESTON</title>
		<content>    In 1967 the{Muslim}community in    
 Frenchwood bought an old vicarage in  
 Clarendon Street and converted it into
 a Mosque.The number of Muslims grew so
 two adjoining houses were purchased.  
 These buildings have a small prayer   
 hall and classrooms. Children go after
 school to study the Koran. About 500  
 people go to the{Mosque}every week.   
 Friday is the busiest day.            
    The Muslim community decided in the
 late 1970's that a{new"Masjid"}was    
 needed. Every Muslim family in French 
 -wood donated money and fund raisers  
 went to Canada,Saudi Arabia,Zambia and
 S.Africa.Â£183,000 was donated.The foun
 -dation stone was laid in July '83.The
 Mosque will be finished by late 1985. 
    The new Prayer Hall will hold 500  
 people.There will be rooms for women, 
 and also a Community Centre and Youth 
 Club.                                 </content>
