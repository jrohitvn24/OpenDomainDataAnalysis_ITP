 a play about St George. Sarah Jane

{morris dancers}outside The Crown.     
 Everyone danced round the{maypole.    
 Several times a year, there are{Jazz  
{Thrash}evenings behind The Red Lion   
 to raise funds for the church. One    
 Sunday each June Turners Hill is      
 invaded by bicyclists on the{London to
{Brighton Bike}ride. In 1985, about

 of them stopped for a rest. Bikes
