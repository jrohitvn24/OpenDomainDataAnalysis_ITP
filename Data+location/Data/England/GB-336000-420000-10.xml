		<content>WE INTERVIEWED THE CHAIRMAN OF BANKS   
PARISH COUNCIL.BANKS' ORIGINAL NAME WAS
THE PARISH OF NORTH MEOLS.             
 THE CHAIRMAN ENJOYS HER JOB VERY MUCH 
AND HAS BEEN CONTINUALLY ELECTED CHAIR 
MAN FOR THE LAST SIX TIMES.SHE CHOSE   
THIS JOB BECAUSE SHE IS INTERESTED IN  
THE BANKS COMMUNITY.                   
 THERE ARE NINE ELECTED MEMBERS ON THE 
COUNCIL,SEVEN ARE FROM BANKS AND TWO   
FROM CROSSENS.THE VICE CHAIRMAN TAKES  
THE MEETINGS IF THE CHAIRMAN IS ABSENT.
 THE JOB OF THE PARISH CLERK IS TO KEEP
THE PARISH LOG BOOK AND ACCOUNTS.SHE   
KEEPS "THE MINUTES" OF EVERY MEETING.  
IT IS AN IMPORTANT JOB BECAUSE IT IS   
THE RECORD OF EVERYTHING DONE BY THE   
PARISH COUNCIL.                        
 THE MEETINGS ARE HELD ON THE FIRST    
TUESDAY OF EVERY MONTH UNLESS ONE IS
