 work on the land.Some work in the     
 village,others travel to jobs in near-
 by towns or commute to{London}by rail.
 There are also a number of retired    
 people living here.Being a rural area,
 most families have some form of trans-
 port of their own,so the country roads
 are well used.Children go to school in
 other areas;some are collected by Mini
