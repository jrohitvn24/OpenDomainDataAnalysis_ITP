		<content> There is a concentration of medieval  
 moated sites in this area.They        
 possibly date from a period in the    
 12th and 13th centuries when farmers  
 were moving from the main villages and
 setting up new farmsteads.            
 There are over 13 such sites in this  
 area.Some are 2 sided moats, others   
 triangular and some completely enclose
 a central area.Many have lost their   
 original farmstead and others have    
 been destroyed and ploughed in.       
 Examples can be found at Eyreswood    
 Farm - the moat has now been filled in
 but did enclose a central area;Bourne 
 End Farm, Wootton - which has a deep  
 moat,is possibly 12th century and a   
 defensive site and Moat Farm,         
 Cranfield with its many old closes.
