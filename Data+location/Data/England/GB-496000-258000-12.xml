		<title>12Unilever In Sharnbrook</title>
		<content> Unilever came to Sharnbrook in 1947.  
{They wanted to start research into    
{farm crops and animals.}Lots of space 
 was needed where animals could graze  
 and crops could grow.  The Colworth   
 Estate was for sale - with easy access
 to London and the North. {Unilever has
{benifitted Sharnbrook in many ways.}  
 They have provided interesting work   
 for many people living in Sharnbrook. 
 Many young people from Sharnbrook have
 started with Unilever and benefitted  
 from the{day release scheme.} Unilever
 has attracted people who have helped  
 in a variety of ways.  Some people    
 that Unilever has brought into the    
 area are married to people who have   
 taken jobs locally. {Unilever employs 
{about 1200 people.} There are 27      
 sports and social clubs.  Unilever    
 provides a canteen and subsidises     
 transport.                            </content>
