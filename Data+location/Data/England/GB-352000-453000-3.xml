		<title>03NWWA: ABBEYSTEAD WATER PLANT</title>
		<content>   As part of a scheme completed in the
 1970s to increase the supply of water 
 to the Fylde, the North-West Water    
 Authority built a tunnel to divert    
 water from the Lune into the Wyre. The
 outflow chambers from the tunnel lie  
 just below Abbeystead Dam and here on 
 the north bank is an underground      
 pumping station or valvehouse. In May 
 1984 a group from St.Michaels-on-Wyre,
 worried about recent flooding on their
 stretch of the river, was being shown 
 round the plant by NWWA officials when
 a violent explosion took place,killing
 16 people and injuring 28. No-one     
 local was hurt but many were involved 
 in the rescue work. The explosion was 
 caused by the build-up of methane gas 
 in the unventilated tunnel.During late
 1985 an extensive seismic survey is   
 being carried out in order to examine 
 the extent of the methane deposits.   </content>
