		<title>06Housing Action Areas</title>
		<content> In earlier times most of this area's  
 population was employed in the cotton 
 mills. The mills were surrounded by   
 rows of terraced houses. The          
 housewives took pride in keeping their
 homes clean, often scrubbing the      
 pavements outside their front doors   
 and whitening the step with a 'donkey-
 stone'. Much of this property dates   
 from l885-l914 and so needs           
 modernising. Some of it falls into    
 Housing Action Areas, allowing older  
 property to qualify for 95% improve-  
 ment grants. Some of the streets near 
{Rishton Lane}and{Swan Lane}are now    
 permanently closed to traffic so that 
 children can play safely in the narrow
 streets. Most of the mills have been  
 demolished. Some, like{Swan Lane}and  
{Grecian Mills,}now house many small   
 firms who rent space in them.
