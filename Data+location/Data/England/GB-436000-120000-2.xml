		<content> news was forthcoming but the day      
 seemed brighter and far from boring.  
 1.00-4.00 Received various phone calls
 (PTA,my employer,friends,relatives).  
 Delt with matters arising from the    
 phone calls, interspersed by visitors,
 further phone calls and bulletins on  
 the still continuing local dispute.   
 Tracked down prescription lost in     
 earlier confusion. Comforted a friend 
 in need. 4.00 Abruptly interrupted by 
 my son, soaked and petrified by a     
 storm. 4.00- 8.00 Dried, comforted and
 fed my children. Refered their        
 disputes and solved their problems,   
 interrupted by phone calls and visits 
 prompted by a PTA meeting scheduled   
 for that evening. 8.00-10.00 Completed
 outstanding matters arrising from     
 calls earlier that day. 9.30 My       
 husband arrived home after late duty. 
 10.30 Sleep!                          </content>
