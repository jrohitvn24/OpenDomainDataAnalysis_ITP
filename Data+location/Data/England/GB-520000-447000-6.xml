		<content> On school days we got up at 7.00am but
 later on Sundays.We had jobs on       
 Saturday morning and Church services  
 on Sunday.Our parents woke us up and  
 we washed in the kitchen.My sister and
 I shared a double bed and we had home 
 made rugs each side of the bed.Our    
 clothes were hand made and in the     
 Summer gingham dresses.We ate a       
 breakfast of porridge,bacon and hot   
 bread cakes.We walked to school and   
 took sandwiches and ate them in the   
 classroom.The school was at the       
 Mereside and began with the ringing of
 the bell.Our lessons were Arithmetic, 
 Geography,Drawing,and Sport.We wrote  
 in books and used a wooden pen and    
 metal nib to dip in the inkwell.We    
 played cricket,racing,and football.We 
 went to bed on dark nights at 6.00pm.
