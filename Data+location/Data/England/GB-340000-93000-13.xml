		<content>    The Post Office Premises  abut onto
 the S. side of the A. 35 at           
 Morcombelake, offering all the usual  
 Post Office faclities, including a    
 post box and telephone kiosk. The shop
 has two sections, one for Post Office 
 buisness and another for display and  
 sale of groceries, confectionery and  
 useful  household goods.This is the   
 only shop serving Morcombelake and the
 farms lying N. and S. of the A. 35    
 road. There is also passing trade from
 the busy road. The shop is a focal    
 point in the district and appears to  
 serve as a meeting place for          
 neighbours to chat and exchange local 
 news.                                 
    The village is a scattered one with
 poor road communications to farms and 
 the shop serves an important social   
 need in addition to it's function of  
 retailing goods.                      </content>
