		<title>04THE RIVER EDEN</title>
		<content> The river is one of the very few{north
{flowing}rivers in England.It passes   
 through {Stenkrith }where there are   
 water-falls and interesting shapes in 
 the rock where the water has eaten    
 away at it.There are also places where
 people swim and the ruins of an old   
 mill.The water at {Stenkrith}was used 
 to make electricity for the station   
 but now the system and the station are
 closed.                               
 The river then flows through farmland 
 and under Franks Bridge which used to 
 be used for packhorses going to {     
{Nateby.}Round here can be seen {sand- 
{stone and Brockram.}Next it passes the
 cricket and  football pitches before  
 reaching Lowmill Bridge once the site 
 of two mills.After passing under the  
 New Bridge on the A685 the river      
 follows the old Appleby road.Lots of  
 people fish in the Eden for trout.    </content>
