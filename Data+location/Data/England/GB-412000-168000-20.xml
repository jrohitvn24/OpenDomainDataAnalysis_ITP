		<title>20Manton Racehorses</title>
		<content> Racehorses have been trained for many 
 years on Manton Downs. At Manton House
 they are fed on oats and hay at       
 7 a.m. every morning. Then they are   
 ridden for an hour or two, except on  
 Sundays, while the stables are        
 cleaned out. There are 6 gallops for  
 training on the 2000 acres_some flat, 
 some uphill.                          
 Between 30 and 40 people work there,  
 looking after the horses. About 80    
 racehorses are kept, half of them     
 American bred. The youngest are one   
 year old. Some stay until they are 6  
 years old. They are taken to races at 
 Ascot, Newbury, Salisbury, Bath and   
 Newmarket. One of the most famous     
 horses to be trained at Manton was    
 called Gainsborough.
