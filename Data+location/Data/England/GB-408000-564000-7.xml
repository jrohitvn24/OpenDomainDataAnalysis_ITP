		<content>   High Barns Farm,Ovingham,is typical 
 of the area.More unusual is the large 
 dairy farm at Wylam.                  
   Mr Bramwell lives at High Barns     
 Farm,which is one of two which he     
 farms,although it is actually owned by
 Lord Allendale.Men are employed on the
 two farms with their own jobs to      
 do.These include milking the          
 cows,mucking out and feeding the stock
 and managing the machines.The         
 livestock consists of Limousin and    
 Fresian which are usually kept for    
 four of five years and then sold.     
 The land is used for grazing and      
 crops.The main crop that is grown is  
 barley.On the farm there are four     
 tractors,a combine harvester and a    
 grain dryer.
