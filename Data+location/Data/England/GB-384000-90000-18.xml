		<content> Control Model Systems is a small      
 business manufacturing coin-operated  
 models of cars, boats and trucks. The 
 equipment is operated from a          
 micro-processor based comman centre   
 which can control up to 24 player     
 positions. The skill factor is        
 sufficient to encourage repeated      
 playing. The firm also offers advice  
 on layout, and designs construction   
 drawings. The models range in size    
 from 64 inches down to 21 inches and  
 are very versatile, some even climbing
 slopes, and have great play appeal.   
 Systems are installed widely overseas.
 The firm operates from a small        
 workshop and office.
