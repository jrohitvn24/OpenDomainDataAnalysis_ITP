		<title>01Farmland around Curry Mallet</title>
		<content> This area consists of farmland in     
 which there are the isolated villages 
 of Curry Mallet (population 280),     
 Beercrocombe (population 120), Isle   
 Abbots (population 160) and part of   
 fivehead(population 800). Much of the 
 land is owned by the Duchy of Cornwall
 and the Prince of Wales takes a keen  
 interest in the area, making frequent 
 visits. Farming is principally        
 dairying but sheep, poultry and pigs  
 are farmed. Crops are grown for hay   
 and silage. The whole area of gently  
 rolling countryside is interlaced with
 a seemingly enormous number of narrow 
 lanes. These are very prone to        
 flooding and are usually extremely    
 muddy during the winter months, as a  
 result of this and the farming        
 activity.
