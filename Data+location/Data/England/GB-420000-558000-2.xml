		<content> Until l972 lay on the old borough     
 boundary and marked the extent of the 
 town's western expansion.             
  From l936 new housing was created on 
 the hillside above the new Team Valley
 industrial estate. Council houses on  
 the lower slopes were followed by     
 private ones up the hill designed to  
 provide economical housing for those  
 attracted away from the town centre   
 terraces.                             
  Shops are to be found in two centres 
 either side of the A692 Lobley Hill   
 Road. A primary school was built in   
 l95O and two secondary schools in the 
 l96O's. A library, community and      
 health centre, a park and garden      
 centre are the main local amenities.  
  Recent years have seen a major growth
 in commuter traffic from the west.
