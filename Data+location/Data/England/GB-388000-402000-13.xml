		<content>   Lancaster Court is a home for       
 handicapped children. It was opened in
 l976. The Spastics Society and        
 Manchester Council built it jointly.  
 It is now one of three homes for      
 severely handicapped children run by  
 the Manchester Social Services        
 Department. Gary Jackson was the first
 officer-in-charge but he died in 1982 
 and they named the playroom after him.
 There were some severely handicapped  
 children who could not walk. There are
 five houseparents in each bungalow.   
 Pictures hang on the wall and there   
 was a television in every living-room 
 and a stereo with a radio.            
   Nick is ten years old. He is        
 improving. He can walk and speak! Ian 
 is twelve years old and snores. He    
 looks like a five year old. Soon they 
 are all going to Blackpool for a four 
 day holiday.                          </content>
