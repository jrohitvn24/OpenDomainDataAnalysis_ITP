		<content> SNODS EDGE ST.JOHNS CHURCH HALL.      
 The Hall was originally the parish    
 school,erected in 1877 by the trustees
 of Lord Crewe,who are supposed to     
 contribute Â£10p.a.towards its upkeep. 
 It ceased to be a school in 1960      
 because of a drop in population and it
 became a parish hall.A number of      
 extensions and improvements have been 
 made to the Hall,organised by the Hall
 Committee and financed by the support 
 of the parishioners.                  
       The Hall is used extensively by 
 the many clubs,societies and sporting 
 organisations in the parish.It has in 
 recent years won the award for "The   
 Best Kept Parish Hall"twice.This award
 takes into account the condition of   
 the Hall,and the amount of usage and  
 benefit it has to the community.Though
 it is a Parish Hall,it is in fact a   
 licensed premises.                    </content>
