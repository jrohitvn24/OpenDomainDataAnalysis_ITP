		<content> In the centre of Pevensey Bay is a    
 small postal{sorting office }that has 
 been in use for the last 5 years.There
 are 8{postmen and women}and supervisor
 working everyday except Sundays from  
 5am to 1pm.They deal with about 3000  
 letters and parcels a day.They sort   
 for their own roads when the bags     
 arrive from {Brighton,}and deliver    
 over an area from Eastbourne to       
 Norman's Bay and inland to Pevensey   
 and Hankham.If envelopes or wrappings 
 are torn and cannot be delivered they 
 are put in a special bag and returned 
 to the sender or "killed off".The     
 busiest times are Wednesdays and      
 Christmas. There are two deliveries,  
 morning and afternoon,the pillar boxes
 are emptied during their rounds. In   
 some areas birds' nests and litter    
 have been found in them. The postmen  
 walk or use bicycles.                 </content>
