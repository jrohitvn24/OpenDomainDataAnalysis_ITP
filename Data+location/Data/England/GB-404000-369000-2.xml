 The most obvious industrial activity  
 in the area is quarrying. The         
 limestone plateau begins near the     
 western edge of our area; only the    
 corner near the Stanley Moor          
 reservoir is Millstone Grit.          
 The limestone was formed about {280   
{million years ago} when the area was  
 covered by a shallow sea As it is very
 pure the limestone has been quarried  
 since the 16th century. On Grin Low th
 you can see mounds of ash left after  
 the lime had  been burnt in kilns.    
 There is a very large disused quarry  
 near Ladmanlow which is now a caravan 
 site. There is another old quarry near
 the site of the old Harpur Hill       
 Station. You can now walk along part  
 of the line of the Cromford &amp; High    
 Peak Railway which served the quarries
