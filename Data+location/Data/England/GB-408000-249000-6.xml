		<content> The Moyfield Riding School in South   
 Littleton has about fifty acres of    
 grazing and stabling for one hundred  
 horses. The school employes six people
 and approximately one hundred people  
 use the stables every week.           
                                       
 Children have to go to nearby villages
 for Cub Scouts, Scouts, Brownies,     
 Guides, Swimming, Judo and Youth      
 Clubs. However, television is a       
 popular pastime with all ages. Adults 
 persue a variety of hobbies, a popular
 one being gardening, but again many   
 have to go out of their village for   
 other activities. Nevertheless, there 
 is a strong community spirit within   
 the area. People are friendly and     
 helpful to each other and welcome new 
 comers.
