		<content> Nichola. (Holiday)                    
 On Saturday I got up at 8 AM and set  
 the shower in the bathroom.  After a  
 shower I got dressed and had toast for
 breakfast.  Then I went to the shop.  
 There was a sign on the door saying   
 that it was opening at 9 AM.  I went  
 back to the caravan to tell my dad I  
 was going for a walk along the beach. 
 After a long walk the shop had opened 
 so I told dad who gave me some money. 
 I bought a game then went to the      
 amusement arcade.  After dinner of    
 fish and chips I went on the beach and
 paddled and sunbathed.  In the        
 afternoon we went to Rhyl and got back
 at 5 PM for tea.  At 7.30 PM we went  
 to the club for a drink then we came  
 back at 10.30 PM.  Then we went to    
 bed.
