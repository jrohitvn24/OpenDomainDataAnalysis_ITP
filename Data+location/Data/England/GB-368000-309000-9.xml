		<content>  Half the children in our class of 10 
 and 11 year olds at St. Georges       
 Primary School own home computers.    
 Two thirds of them write simple       
 programs as well as playing games. On 
 average they play with their computers
 9 hours a week.                       
                                       
  The favourite computer game is about 
 football. You can play against the    
 computer or against another person. On
 the screen you see a football game.   
 You control one player at a time by   
 pressing different keys. The second   
 favourite game is an adventure game.  
 You type simple commands in words to  
 make a character go around collecting 
 things for killing green creatures    
 like Martians. You can get killed.    
 Finally you confront the leader and   
 kill him if you can.
