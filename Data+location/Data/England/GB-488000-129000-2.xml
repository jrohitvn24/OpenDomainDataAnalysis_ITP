		<content>     The three heathers, Ling, Bell    
 and, in marshy ground, Crossed-leaved 
 heather form with Bracken and Gorse   
 the ground cover of the open moorland.
 Holly and Honeysuckle are also useful 
 foodplants found in sheltered valleys.
     In the more sheltered lower ground
 and on the clay there is a greater    
 wealth of flowering plants and more   
 shelter for animals. In spring the    
 sunnier southern slopes have Cuckoo   
 flowers, Stitchwort, and King-cups.   
     The main tree now on Blackdown is 
 the Scots pine. When grazing ceased it
 was the first to grow along with the  
 Birch. There are also Oaks, Whitebeam,
 Rowan and Beeches. At Marley Common   
 are Beech, Wild Service Trees and     
 Sweet Chestnuts which are coppiced    
 for stakes and fencing.
