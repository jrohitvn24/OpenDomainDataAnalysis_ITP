		<content>  Electricity is the main source of    
 lighting and power. There is no North 
 Sea Gas available, although the       
 pipeline runs close by. Electricity,  
 Calor Gas, oil, solid fuel, wood and  
 straw are the fuels used for heating. 
 These are delivered by lorry, to the  
 house, but most farmers have their own
 supply of wood and straw.             
  Power cuts are quite common in the   
 winter months. Some farms and         
 businesses have generators in case of 
 power cuts, to keep machinery going.  
  A few homes have double glazing, and 
 most are insulated to save energy, as 
 householders are becoming very aware  
 of the increasing cost of fuel.
