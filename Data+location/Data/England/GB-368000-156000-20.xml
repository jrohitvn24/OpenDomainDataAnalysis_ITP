		<content> There are 8 places of worship within  
 our block. Of the 3 Anglican churches 
 one, at{Shoscombe}is used as a school 
 during weekdays with the chancel      
 unscreened during worship. Being deep 
 in the territory of{John Wesley}there 
 are 4 nonconformist chapels still in  
 use, many of the small village chapels
 are now disused. The chapel at        
{Camerton}is on the site of one of the 
 first Wesleyan chapels. There is a    
 Roman Catholic church and a           
 Christodelphian hall both situated at 
{Peasedown.}Generally weekly           
 congregation numbers have fallen      
 although churches are still full at   
 religious festivals and constantly    
 used for family occasions, being      
 considered an integral part of        
{community life}today.
