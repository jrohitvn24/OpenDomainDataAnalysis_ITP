		<title>15MARKETING FARM PRODUCE</title>
		<content>   Most of the crops grown on farms are
 sent away after they have been        
 harvested, though some are kept for   
 feeding the animals kept on the farm. 
   The sugar beet is sent to the  sugar
 beet factory at Cantley, though the   
 tops are kept for animal fodder.  The 
 wheat and barley is sent away to the  
 corn merchants at Norwich.  The farmer
 is guaranteed a good price for his    
 crops from the EEC.  Peas are also    
 grown on some farms and these are sent
 to Lowestoft and North Walsham for    
 freezing.                             
   The milk from the cattle is         
 collected by a lorry Belonging to the 
 Milk Marketing Board.  The pigs and   
 catlle are sent to the slaughter house
 in Norwich.
