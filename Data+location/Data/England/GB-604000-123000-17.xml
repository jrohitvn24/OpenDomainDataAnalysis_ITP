		<title>17NEW ROMNEY BIRDS</title>
		<content> HERONS ARE USUALLY FOUND IN DYKES,    
 MARSHES AND BOGGY AREAS,HUNTING FOR   
 PREY LIKE FISH OR FROGS.DOWN NEAR MY  
 HOUSE THERE IS A DITCH WHERE A PAIR OF
 HERONS ARE NESTING.AT REST THEY STAND 
 ON ONE LEG WITH THEIR EYES HALF       
 CLOSED.HERONS ARE GRADUALLY           
 DISAPPEARING FROM OUR MARSH BECAUSE OF
 CARELESS FISHERMEN AND CHEMICAL USERS.
 SOMETIMES I SEE A HERON ON OUR HOUSE  
 ROOF BUT THAT DOESN'T COME ANY MORE   
 PERHAPS IT HAS MOVED OR BEEN KILLED.  
 PEOPLE IN NEW ROMNEY HAVE TO COVER    
 THEIR PONDS WITH NETS TO PREVENT      
 HERONS FROM STEALING THEIR FISH.      
       AROUND OUR SCHOOL THERE USED TO 
 BE A PAIR OF KESTRELS WHO HUNTED ON   
 SOME ROUGH GROUND.NOW THEY HAVE GONE  
 BECAUSE THE GROUND HAS BEEN CLEARED   
 AND HOUSES BUILT THERE.
