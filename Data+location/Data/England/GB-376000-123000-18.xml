		<content> Thorngrove House and its 50 acres of  
 grounds were acquired in 1965 for the 
 Spastics Society.The oak staircase and
 hall have been carpeted as a safety   
 measure,doorways have been altered to 
 comply with fire precautions but the  
 House is a real home again.There are  
 28 residents and each does the job he 
 or she does best,either indoors or    
 out.Staff are in two groups,one for   
 caring,cleaning and generally looking 
 after everyone;the other concerned    
 with work outdoors in greenhouses and 
 potting sheds. The estate is run by   
 the Spastics Society as an            
 Agricultural and Garden centre,making 
 wooden garden furniture and producing 
 many thousands of plants for sale to  
 the public.They make a speciality of  
 filling hanging baskets.
