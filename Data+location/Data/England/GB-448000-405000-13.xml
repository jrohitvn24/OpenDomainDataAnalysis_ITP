		<title>13 The Supernatural Hickleton</title>
		<content>{Hickleton}is the only place with      
 ghostly associations.This is probably 
 because old Lord Halifax used to      
 collect and retell{ghost stories}to   
 his friends,family and the village    
 children.In school we have a{ghost    
 book with{stories}collected by Lord   
 Halifax from all sorts of people.There
 is supposed to be the{ghost}of a nun  
 in a brown habit who{haunts}Monk Hill.
 There is however a very old nun called
 Sister Cecilia who lives in the Sue   
 Ryder Home,she was the headteacher of 
 the village school and she diddn't go 
 back to the convent when she retired  
 in 1951.Her habit is also brown!The   
 ghost of the brown nun is the only    
 ghost who roams around in our area.We 
 think this is very suprising.Usually  
 there are many rumours in villages    
 like this.We have used page 13 because
 of its{supernatural}connections.      </content>
