		<title>17Grampound Village</title>
		<content>  The ancient township of Grampound is 
 situated on the A390 about 6 miles    
 from St. Austell and 7 miles from     
 Truro.It was mentioned in the         
 "Doomesday Book" and it was one of    
 those areas confiscated by William the
 Conqueror and given to his half       
 brother.                              
  Today it is a non growth village.    
 There has been little new development 
 here for many years apart from a small
 development known as Bonython Drive   
 built 9 years ago.                    
  Being a main road village there is   
 constant fear concerning safety.Many  
 radar traps are put in the village but
 this does not seem to deter the       
 speeding that goes on.                
  The school is one of the main reasons
 that the village continues to thrive- 
 few people choose to live in a village
 that does not have a school           </content>
