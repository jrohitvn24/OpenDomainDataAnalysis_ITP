		<title>10Abbotsley Church clock</title>
		<content> The church clock is about 285 years   
 old. Some of it has been modified in  
 the last century.The clock is wound   
 once a day in the evening.If you are  
 in the tower winding the clock at any 
 o'clock time you get deafened by the  
 noise.There are five bells but only   
 two of them work. One is used for     
 ringing when it is time for a church  
 service and the other strikes the     
 hour.The clock goes by a weight that  
 pulls on a drum that makes the hands  
 go round.The clock stopped at five    
 because two men were wiring the  hands
 up so they would not fall off and five
 o'clock was home time for them so they
 stopped it at five o'clock.The weights
 are about ten kg each.My father and I 
 started it going after it had stopped 
 for five or six years by taking it    
 apart and we cleaned it and repaired  
 it then put it back together.         </content>
