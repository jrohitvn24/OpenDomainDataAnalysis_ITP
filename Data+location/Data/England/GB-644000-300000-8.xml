		<title>08BELTON VILLAGE</title>
		<content> Belton was, until 1970 a tiny village 
 on the edge of the Waveney marshes.It 
 had no through route and lost its     
 railway station under the 'Beeching   
 Axe'.The Norfolk Structure Plan       
 concentrated East Norfolk development 
 South of Gt.Yarmouth and during the   
 1970's Belton grew rapidly.Today its  
 population is over four thousand,yet  
 it lacks nearly all the amenities     
 normally associated with a settlement 
 of this size.The village probably has 
 the lowest property values of the area
 and consequently has many young       
 families purchasing their first homes.
 Belton's two primary school are not   
 experiencing the falling roll numbers 
 general elsewhere in East Norfolk.    
 There are almost no full-time jobs    
 within the village and most people    
 commute by the almost essential       
 private car.                          </content>
