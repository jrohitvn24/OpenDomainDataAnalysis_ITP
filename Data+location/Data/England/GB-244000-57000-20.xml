		<title>20MEMORY/OPINION IN N.PROSPECT</title>
		<content>{We found that most Plymouth citizens  
 were very happy living where they were
 and did not want to live anywhere     
 else.The few people who had not lived 
{in Plymouth all their lives,moved here
 because of jobs (eg.In the Dockyard)  
 or family.The majority of these people
 said they would like to return to     
{their home town.A large number of     
 people remembered the Jubilee,Sir     
 Francis Chichester's return from      
 sailing around the World and the tall 
{ships race.The elderly people had     
 memories of Plymouth surrounded by    
 fields and forrests.The residents     
 thought that there was a lot to do in 
{Plymouth,and that the shops were      
 pleasant and convenient.The things    
 that they disliked were the problems  
 of vandalism and graffiti.In addition,
{the older people did not like the new 
 buildings,and the new estates.        </content>
