		<content>    The South Square complex was       
 officially opened by the Mayor of     
 Bradford on Saturday April 20th 1985. 
 As well as the activities already     
 there at South Square this date saw   
 the opening of a centre for tourism, a
 local museum and exhibition area,     
 craft shop and tea room. The centre   
 will be used for wool sales, Spring   
 Auctions, art and craft and           
 photography workshops and fund raising
 functions.                            
     There is a pottery called 'The    
 Pothole' run by a local artist who    
 will undertake private commisssions.  
 You are encouraged to watch the       
 pottery being made.                   
    The South Square project has been  
 organised completely by local people  
 for use by the community.
