		<content> The Cathedral Church of St. Mary the  
 Virgin,St.Peter and St.Cedd,is the    
{parish church of Chelmsford.}It is    
 situated at the head of the High St.on
 an{ancient raised site.}Although the  
 present building was erected around   
{1420,}there is evidence of a church on
 the site much earlier, possibly from  
 Saxon times.                          
 The Diocese of Chelmsford{is the 2nd. 
{largest in terms of population.       
 Much modified over the years,the last 
 reordering of the Cathedral interior  
 was in{1983.}This included the        
 installation of a new floor,altar,a   
 wall hanging by Beryl Dean and the    
{strikingly-designed ironwork of cross,
{ambos and chapel screens by Giuseppe  
{Lund.}The new interlocking chairs     
 replaced the Nave pews,allowing the   
 area to be cleared for use during     
 musical and dramatic events.          </content>
