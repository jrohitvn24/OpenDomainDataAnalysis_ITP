		<title>09The Life of an 'Army' Wife</title>
		<content>  We spoke to a very friendly group of 
 young wives from Bulford Camp.Most of 
 them enjoyed the frequent moves, every
 two or three years, but saw problems  
 ahead with their children's education.
 They said that despite the moves they 
 were able to maintain friendships as  
 most units moved together.            
  During their husband's many absences 
 on exercises the childless  wives     
 tended to go back to the family home, 
 whilst those with children stayed on  
 Camp.                                 
  Two complaints were predominant, the 
 smallness of married quarters and the 
 distance from the nearest big shopping
 town, Salisbury. There is a good      
 regular bus service, but as the cost  
 per adult is Â£2 return, most found it 
 too expensive to make frequent visits.
  The shopping facilities at Bulford   
 were thought to be adequate.          </content>
