		<content>{Other means of Transport.             
 The main methods of transport have    
 been mentioned,but one or two people  
 do cycle around the area,yet as it is 
 quite hilly it is not one of the more 
 popular forms.Many people who live in 
 the villages usually walk if they have
 not got very far to go,yet from       
 village to village is difficult not   
 only because of hills but also because
 of the hazards caused by narrow roads 
 with high Cornish walls.              
{Employment.                           
 As the area is at the end of the      
 Roseland Peninsula,this means that    
 there are difficulties of employment. 
 The area is some distance from the    
 main A road and the connecting roads  
 from this block are mainly winding and
 narrow,skirting farms and medows.They 
 are therefore unsuitable fof heavy    
 traffic.{PTO                          </content>
