		<content>   We interviewed people about the     
{changes}that have happened in Loughton
 and they thought that old Loughton was
 better because there was more choice  
 of shops and personal attention.      
 Groceries were cheaper and of better  
 quality. Many of the older{shops}which
 people prefered have gone and in their
 place is the modern supermarket. This 
 was one of the main reasons for the   
 formation of the{LRA}(Loughton        
 Residents Association), to protest    
 against this. The LRA is the non-     
 political branch of local government  
 with six representatives and also one 
 on the County Council.                
   Loughton was a small quiet village  
 with little{traffic}but now there is

 vehicles and this makes parking and   
 shopping difficult. Bus services are  
 not as frequent now as they used to   </content>
