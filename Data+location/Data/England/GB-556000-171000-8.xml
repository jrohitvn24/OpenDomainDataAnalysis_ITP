		<content>   Entering the sessile oak and birch  
 woodland lying on the lighter soils of
 the plateau gravel, we were greeted by
 the songs of the blackcap and willow  
 warbler.  Under the fairly open canopy
 the ground cover of bramble was quite 
 dense but we noticed an extensive     
 patch of large wood rush and the      
 leaves of numerous lily of the valley.
 Moving down the slope, the oak is     
 partially replaced by sweet chestnut. 
 This casts a denser shade and the     
 bramble had decreased.  Further down  
 in the transitional zone marked by    
 coppiced hornbeam, wood anemones were 
 abundant.  Large patches of dog's     
 mercury were common and among them    
 leaves of wood sorrel, not yet in     
 flower.  Birch polypore fungus had    
 killed several trees.  A pair of green
 woodpeckers could be heard drilling in
 the rotten wood to find insects.      </content>
