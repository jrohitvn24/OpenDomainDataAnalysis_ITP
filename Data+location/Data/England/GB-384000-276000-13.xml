		<title>13CHILDREN'S WEEKENDS - 2.</title>
		<content>{Saturday.}1. In the morning I go to   
 "Stage &amp; Tap" with my sister. In the  
 afternoon we go shopping. When we have
 been round all the shops, we go home  
 in the car.                           
    2. I get up about 8.00a.m., get    
 dressed, go downstairs and have       
 breakfast. At 10.00a.m. my Dad comes  
 home from work. At 11.20a.m. I go     
 horse-riding at Lea Castle Riding     
 School. Sometimes we go on a hack or  
 sometimes we just have lessons. I go  
 home, have my dinner and at 2.00p.m.  
 we usually go out somewhere. When we  
 come back, I sometimes go to Roller   
 Disco. After tea I help in the shop,  
 stocking up and doing the bottles.    
 About 9.00p.m. we have supper and then
 I go to bed.                          
    3. I watch TV, have my breakfast   
 and then play with my puppy. After    
 dinner I play table-tennis.           </content>
