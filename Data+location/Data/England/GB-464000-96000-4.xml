		<title>04KING'S THEATRE SOUTHSEA</title>
		<content> The {King's Theatre}was opened in     
 September 1907. The theatre is in     
 Albert Road Southsea. About 1650      
 people can be seated in the theatre.  
 There are four levels, they are the   
 stalls, dress-circle, upper-circle,and
 the gods.In early days,up in the gods 
 the poor people used to pay 1 whole   
 penny,so they could see the plays     
 without mixing with the rich          
 people.Also in the gods there is the  
 Limes,a room where the spotlights     
 shine onto the stars on the stage.The 
 sound and lighting are worked by      
 computer.The stage is sloped and was  
 built over a small stream.The {Kings} 
 is one of the premiere theatres in    
 England.Today they stage musicals     
 ,pantomimes,and plays.They do not     
 write the plays we see,they are       
 offered to them by touring companies.
