		<title>10Inhabitants Amberley</title>
		<content> This area is sparsely populated,      
 people living in small hamlets and    
 isolated dwellings.                   
 Several families have lived in the    
 area for generations in some cases    
 continuing to occupy the same house.  
 Families with a few exceptions have   
 two or three children. No ethnic      
 minorities are living locally.        
 Occupations include farming, landwork 
 and service industries. The latter    
 being maintenance, plumbing,          
 electrical, decorating and gardening. 
 Many professional people settle in    
 Amberley and the surrounding district 
 when they retire.
