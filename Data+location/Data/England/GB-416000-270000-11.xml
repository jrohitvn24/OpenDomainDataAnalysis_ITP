		<title>11PACKWOOD HOUSE</title>
		<content> This house was first owned by the     
 Fetherstone family and wasbought by   
 Graham Ash this century.He gave it to 
 the NATIONAL TRUST in 1941 as he had  
 no children.                          
                                       
 30 000 people come to see the house   
 each year.Visitors like the house     
 because it is not too big.They feel   
 they could live in it.                
                                       
 The most valuable item is probably    
 thelong oak table.It is huge.         
                                       
 Queen Mary came for tea in 1927.You   
 can see the chair she sat in.
