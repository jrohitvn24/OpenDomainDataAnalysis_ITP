need to go into Herne Bay , The nearest

have their own clubs selling drinks,   
and there is also a pub called The     
Ethelbert.Other facilities include an  
amusement arcade, a kiddies korner,    
bingo, a betting shop and other mobile 
shops such as fish and chips.Quite a   
number of people visit with children   
because the beach is quite safe when   
the tide is out and there is plenty of 
room to spread out.
