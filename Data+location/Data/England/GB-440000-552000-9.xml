		<title>09Life in Grangetown</title>
		<content>    This morning we went down to the   
 school library where we were talking  
 to Mr.Norman Tough about his life in  
{Grangetown.}Mr.Tough is 81 years old  
 and was born in{Grangetown}in 1904 and
 has lived there all his life. He told 
 us about Grangetown when he was a boy.
    He told us about the cost of the   
{trams.}It was only \d for children    
 and 1d for adults. When he was little 
 if he had no money to go on the{tram  
 he used to run along with it and then 
 he held on to the end of the tram and 
 he got a free ride to the town. He    
 said he had a delivery bike with solid
 rubber tyres and if the tyre got into 
 the{tram tracks}it got stuck and he   
 had to lift it out. Then he said when 
 he was playing outside he just left   
 the door open and nobody ever thought 
 of stealing anything or just walking  
 inside the house.                     </content>
