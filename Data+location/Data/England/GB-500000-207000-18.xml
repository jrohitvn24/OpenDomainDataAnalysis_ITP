		<content>{          BRITISH BULLDOG.            
                                       
 BULLDOG IS PLAYED WITH ONE PERSON WHO 
 IS KNOWN AS 'IT' CHASING THE REST. IF 
 ONE PERSON IS CAUGHT THEY ALSO BECOME 
 'IT'. TO CATCH A PERSON YOU HAVE TO   
 SAY 'BRITISH BULLDOG 1.2.3'. YOU NEED 
 5 OR MORE PEOPLE AND A CLEAR AREA TO  
 PLAY THIS GAME.                       
                                       
 AT THE END OF THE GAME, WHEN EVERYONE 
 IS 'IT', THE FIRST PERSON WHO WAS     
 CAUGHT STARTS THE NEXT GAME 'IT'.     
                                       
 THIS GAME IS SOMETIMES PLAYED IN      
 SCHOOL AT BREAK AND LUNCH TIMES.
