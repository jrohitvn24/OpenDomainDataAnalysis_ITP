		<title>16HUNTCLIFFE SCHOOL, SALTBURN</title>
		<content> Just 18 months after winning a battle 
 to keep it open, Huntcliff, Saltburn's
 only Comprehensive School is again    
 under threat of closure. This is one  
 of four options being considered by   
 Cleveland County Council which could  
 affect the future of the school. The  
 Authority is concerned about the fall 
 in roll which could damage the        
 curriculum and the money it could save
 by closing the school. The people of  
 Saltburn have formed an Action Group  
 to fight these proposals as they      
 firmly believe the community should   
 have its own school. The loss of      
 Huntcliff they believe would adversly 
 affect the future of the community.   
 They are also worried about how the   
 children would get to the school in   
 Marske and the dangers involved in    
 walking along the main road. A        
 decision will be made in July 1985.   </content>
