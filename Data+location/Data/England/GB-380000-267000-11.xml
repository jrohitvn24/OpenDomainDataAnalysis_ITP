		<title>11Bishops Wood Nature Trail.</title>
		<content> It was a lovely day as we walked      
 around the nature trail.We saw lots   
 of different trees,oak,birch,alder,   
 beech,ash,holly and aspen.There were  
 lots of examples of the different     
 layers of woodland and of plants that 
 liked different types of soil inc.    
 those that liked damp ground, this was
 in an area where the drainage was     
 poor.Bird nesting boxes had been put  
 lots of the trees to encourage        
 different birds,we heard more than we 
 saw.We were able to look at a profile 
 of soil and measure round the trunk of
 a huge tree.A man showed us a tool for
 taking a sample from a tree to tell   
 its age.In the classroom we saw lots  
 of interesting things, a stuffed      
 badger as well as other creatures.It  
 was all very interesting and not far  
 from our school.(M.Dickson)
