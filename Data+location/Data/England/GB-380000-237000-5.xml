		<content> The largest building in this area is  
 Eastington Hall, a private house of   
 timber-framed construction built about
 1500.  It is sometimes available for  
 Rugby Club, Rotary Club and similar   
 functions.  The owners are proud of   
 their property, and pleased to show it
 off to visitors.                      
                                       
 In common with many other rural areas,
 small properties are often purchased  
 for holiday and weekend use by people 
 who live in towns.  To the south of   
 Stanks Lane, in the corner of a field,
 is one such cottage, the garden of    
 which is well maintained.
