		<title>15Recording Studio, Knebworth.</title>
		<content> There is a recording studio behind the
 Doctors' Surgery in Knebworth.  In one
 of the rooms, behind a soundproof     
 door, there are three keyboards.  One 
 keyboard was plugged into a computer  
 with discdrive and each disc held     
 sounds relating to different subjects 
 ie animals, machines, or instruments. 
 There is also a 24 track recording    
 desk. They use a separate track to    
 record a different instrument or voice
 for each record but may not use them  
 all. The mixing studio has a ceiling  
 which slopes downwards and meets foam 
 on both sides. This is to prevent the 
 sound from bouncing off the walls and 
 being distorted. In the rest room next
 door we were told that a record costs 
 about Â£5,500 to make.  The sales      
 profit is divided between the         
 distributor, record shop, recording   
 company and artist.                   </content>
