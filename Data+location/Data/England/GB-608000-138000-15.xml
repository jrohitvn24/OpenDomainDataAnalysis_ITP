		<content> The village Constable for this area is
 P.C.Cyril Hemsley.He and his wife live
 in the police house,which is also the 
 village Police Station,some 30 yards  
 from the A20 on the left along Swan   
 Lane.He is responsible to Hythe and   
 Folkestone stations but may be sent   
 anywhere in Shepway Division.His main 
 patrol area is Sellindge,Stanford and 
 Monk's Horton,which he covers in a    
 Ford Escort Saloon patrol car.However,
 he also walks his beat within each    
 village.His job mainly entails        
 patrolling roads and lanes in and     
 around the villages and ensuring that 
 farmers obey laws regarding animals,  
 such as the burying of dead sheep.He  
 also calls at private houses if       
 necessary,but some of his duty time is
 spent completing paper work in his    
 office.He has few policing problems as
 he finds the area quiet and peaceful. </content>
