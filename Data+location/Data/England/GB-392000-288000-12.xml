		<content>      Dudley people are from a wide    
 range of backgrounds, and recent Asian
 immigrants have brought their own{    
{languages.}Punjabi is spoken by those 
 from the Punjab in Northern India,    
 Gujarati by those from the West coast 
 and Urdu by those from West Pakistan. 
 These languages are reflected in local
 newsagents and{libraries.}Most        
 families raise their children to be   
 bi-lingual.                           
      In addition to languages, the    
 Asians have brought their{religions,} 
 mainly Muslim, Sikh and Hindu. In all 
 three prayer is an important element. 
 The children also take part in school 
 assemblies. Because of their beliefs  
 the{life style}of these families is   
 sometimes different from their        
 neighbours. Some families are very    
 close and do not mix freely, others   
 try to integrate to different degrees.</content>
