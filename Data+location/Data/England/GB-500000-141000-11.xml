		<content>   Lacrosse is a girls' game and it is 
 played mainly in Surrey. It is played 
 by a team of 12. Each has a stick     
 which has a long wooden handle with a 
 net at one end. The net is used for   
 catching and throwing a hard rubber   
 ball. There is a goal at either end   
 like a small football goal. You can go
 anywhere within a certain limit. You  
 are allowed to run with the ball in   
 the net of your stick. You score a    
 goal by throwing the ball into your   
 team's goal using your lacrosse stick.
   Other games played are netball,     
 rounders and tennis. We also do gym   
 and athletics and we have our own     
 swimming pool.                        
   We have six Houses and there are    
 many inter-house competitions. We also
 have outings and entertain people and 
 make money for charities in our       
 houses.                               </content>
