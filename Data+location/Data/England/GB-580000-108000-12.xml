		<content>  Half the teenage male population of  
 Hastings receive their education in   
 this all boys school. There are 80    
 teachers and over 1,400 pupils. All   
 pupils wear a uniform, consisting of a
 blue blazer which has a school badge, 
 grey trousers, a school tie and dark  
 shoes. The curriculum incluses many   
 subjects including English,           
 Mathematics, Science and Technology,  
 French and the Humanities. At the end 
 of the 5th year they sit exams which  
 help them to get jobs. Many stay on at
 school to improve their               
 qualifications. The better pupils     
 specialise in 3 subjects which they   
 study till they are 18. The exam then 
 will give them qualifications for     
 higher education or employment in a   
 profession.
