		<content>    {Stodmarsh}is a small village about
 five miles away from{Canterbury.}     
    {Stodmarsh}got its name after the  
 monks of{Canterbury}had a stud farm   
 there, where they bred horses; the    
 marsh bit comes from the marsh around 
{Stodmarsh. Stodmarsh}has a very high  
 water table and now people cannot be  
 buried in the church yard because     
 their coffins would just float up     
 again.                                
     Over the years{Stodmarsh's        
 population has got smaller; in 1841   
 there was a population of 145 but     
 now there are only 76 people.         
    {Stodmarsh}is quiet with one post  
 office which sells most general things
 but there is only one snag and that is
 that it is only open on{Tuesday}and   
{Thursday}afternoons, for{eight hours a
{week.}Once there was a bakery which   
 was owned by{Samuel Baker.            </content>
