		<content>    In the civil parish of Morland     
 there are 120 households with 260     
 adults of which 64 were retired       
 leaving 198 under-sixties..           
    Of these 56 worked in the Penrith  
 area and travelled each day by car:12 
 worked in the Appleby/kirby Thore area
 and 7 worked in the Shap/Kendal area. 
 The remainder, 122, stayed in the     
 village and worked either in their    
 trades  ie. shopkeeper,joiner, farmer 
 etc. or worked from the village such  
 as lorry drivers or stayed at home as 
 housewives with perhaps a part time   
 job at Survival Aids.                 
    So most of the working people in   
 the parish work within it with a good 
 proportion working in the Penrith     
 area and commuting each day.
