		<content>      We have a very good security     
 system which is needed for all the    
 computers we have. There is also a    
 library attached to the information   
 centre. It has very advanced          
 peripherals for the main BBC computer 
 including teletext, a modem and a     
 printer. All of the computers have    
 disc drives. We also have a big       
 monitor joined to a computer and      
 people walking by can see easily      
 without interrupting the children     
 working. Because the information      
 centre does not have have any windows 
 we have skylights.                    
      The school is linked to other    
 schools by means of the Times Network 
 for schools. We were the first primary
 school to join this network, a        
 database and mailing system for       
 schools.
