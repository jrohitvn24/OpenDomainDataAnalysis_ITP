		<content>  There no major housing estates in    
 this area. It is mostly isolated small
 holdings. However there is some       
 evidence of council houses which are  
 quite old, and suggests a small       
 working class populace might have     
 originally been present. There are    
 also a number of large new houses,    
 which might suggest that this area is 
 now becoming quite prosperous.The farm
 houses are very old and mostly        
 Georgian. The council houses are      
 mainly red brick.
