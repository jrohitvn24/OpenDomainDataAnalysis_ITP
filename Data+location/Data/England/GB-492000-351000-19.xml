 A great deal of craft work is carried 
 on in the area.Most of this is done at
 hobby level but in many cases of a    
 very high standard.Beautiful examples 
 of needlecraft,knitting and crochet   
 are exhibited regularly.Cake artistry 
 is taught as well as done.Woodwork and
 metal work are also very fine.Classes 
 in arts &amp; crafts are held in the      
 Secondary School in Welbourn          
 CLUBS                                 
 The usual cry is that there is nothing
 to do in the village.This is not      
 strictly true.There is quite a wide   
 variety of clubs for most ages.These  
 include the weekly Youth Club,the     
 fortnightly Over 60's group and the   
 monthly Women's Institute.There is a  
 lively Aerobics Group meeting twice a 
 week and Bingo every Friday. All meet 
 in the Village Hall.                  </content>
