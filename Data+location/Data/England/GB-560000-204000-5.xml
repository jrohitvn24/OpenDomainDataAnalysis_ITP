		<title>05GROWING RAPE IN MID ESSEX</title>
		<content> This is a fairly new and successful   
 crop.It is sown in August by direct   
 drill.It flowers in Spring making the 
 fields bright yellow.It is cut just   
 before it is ripe,about 6 weeks after 
 blossoming and left to ripen on the   
 ground for 2 weeks.Then it is dried   
 and stored in silos.The crushers pay a
 better price if the farmers hang on to
 their crop because they cannot deal   
 with all the harvest at once.This far-
 mer sells his crop in January.        
{Good profits}are made from rape espec-
 ially if the weather is favourable.In 
 1984 it was ideal,a dry Autumn,a wet  
 Spring,and a dry Summer made a bumper 
 crop.To be profitable,it must give at 
 least 20cwt an acre.The 1983 crop gave
 23cwt,1984 30 cwt.In Jan'85 the price 
 was Â£285 a ton,in Jan'84 it was Â£325. 
 The lower price was balanced by a bet-
 ter crop.Rape is used as cooking oil. </content>
