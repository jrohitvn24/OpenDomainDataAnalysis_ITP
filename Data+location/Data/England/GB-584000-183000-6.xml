 In the Cliff Gardens, situated on     
 Clifftown Parade, is the Bandstage    
 where you can hear visiting bands. If 
 the weather is alright there are tea  
 dances held here too. In the morning  
 they hold fun and games for children  
 and it must not be missed on a        
 relaxing sunny afternoon when music is
 being played.                         
 There are a few discos - one of them  
 called Cinatras, on Hamlet Court Road,
 used to be the Queens Hotel. This     
 place used to be used for pop concerts
 and shows.                            
{The Cliffs}                           
 A walk through the Cliff gardens will 
 give you a lot of pleasure. You can   
 see the beautiful floral clock and the
 fountain and lovely flowers in        
 Prittlewell Square.
