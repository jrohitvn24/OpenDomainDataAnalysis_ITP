		<title>03Family Life at the Weekend</title>
		<content>   At the weekend there isn't any      
 school, but mum goes to work at about 
 12.00 as she makes meals at the White 
 Horse which is one of many pubs in    
 the village.                          
   My sister Claire and I have to take 
 it in turns to make the dinner and do 
 the washing up when mum is at work.   
   Robert, my brother, always moans    
 because he doesn't like the food we   
 make especially when his girlfriend,  
 Shirley, comes round.                 
   Dad spends a lot of time at the     
 weekend working on his computer in the
 study, but he also gives all the      
 family lessons in computing.          
   Martin, my older brother, spends    
 most of his time playing around with  
 his car.                              
   On Sundays we take the dog round the
 fields for a walk and afterwards I    
 have to clean the inside of the car.  </content>
