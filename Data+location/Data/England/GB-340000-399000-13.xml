		<title>13Where to go in Kirkby</title>
		<content> A tourist visiting Kirkby would stay  
 at the three star Golden Eagle Hotel. 
 Places to visit in the town are St    
 Chads Church, Sports Centre and the   
 swimming baths. Within easy reach of  
 Kirkby is the Knowsley Safari Park,   
 Croxteth Hall and many other historic 
 buildings. Kirkby is just seven miles 
 from Liverpool, and so it is very     
 convenient to visit Beatle city, the  
 Maritime Museum, Anfield, Goodison    
 Park and many other places of         
 interest.                             
 When tired of sight-seeing the visitor
 could walk in countryside and farmland
 which surround Kirkby and visit nearby
 villages such as Rainford or          
 Bickerstaffe, for a meal and a drink. 
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
