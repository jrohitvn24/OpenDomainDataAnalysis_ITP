		<title>20A SCHOOLCHILD'S DAY</title>
		<content>  Friday morning at 7.30 a.m.,I lazily 
get out of bed. My first stop is the   
bathroom, then back into my room to get
dressed. Then I have breakfast. After  
that, I pack my bag for school. Eight- 
forty comes quickly and Sarah is off to
the High School. I set off for school  
with Steven and arrive in time. Nine o'
clock comes, and I ring the bell.      
  After assembly there's Maths and spe-
lling tests! What will my score be?    
Lunch will come soon, and I will go    
home.                                  
  The afternoon comes and goes quickly,
after Mrs. Williams has shouted at two 
noisy boys.Then it's home again at     
3.30. On Fridays I don't play with my  
friends. Instead I play with my compu- 
ter. I have a drink and some crisps and
then I go to bed where I read for half 
an hour before going to sleep.
