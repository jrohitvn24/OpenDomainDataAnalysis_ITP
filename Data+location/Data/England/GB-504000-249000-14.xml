		<title>14YOUTH ACTIVITIES IN BEDFORD</title>
		<content>    My dad is the youth leader at{     
{Brickhill Baptist Church.}During the  
 year he organises and goes on trips   
 with the young people. As dad is the  
 leader, me and my sister can go on the
 trips as well.                        
  Last year we went to a place called  
 Letton Hall. It was great fun mucking 
 about with the older kids.            
  A while ago we went to Blackpool for 
 a weekend. That was fun too.          
  The young people don't just go on    
 trips, they play games in{Bedford     
{Park,}like rounders and American      
 football.                             
  The reason it is so much fun is      
 because the older kids treat me and my
 sister like kids of their own age and 
 not like little babies like some      
 teenagers do with kids a lot younger  
 than themselves.
