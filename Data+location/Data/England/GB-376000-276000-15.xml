		<title>15Severn Navigation Scheme</title>
		<content>    A current issue is whether the     
 Severn Navigation Restoration Trust   
 should be allowed to restore navigable
 depth to the Severn between Bewdley   
 and Bridgnorth. A weir and boom at    
 Dowles would form part of the scheme. 
 Anglers, conservationists and         
 residents oppose the idea. The ecology
 would be upset, ponding effects could 
 cause pollution and the canoeists     
 would lose the rapids at Trimpley.    
    On the other hand large visiting   
 boats moored in the proposed marinas  
 would bring prosperity to the area.   
 Councillors are awaiting a full report
 before deciding whether to help with  
 funds.Aesthetic and biological aspects
 have to be considered.                
    Deepening the river would mean a   
 total restructuring of a main water   
 course which, unlike a canal, provides
 drainage for the region.              </content>
