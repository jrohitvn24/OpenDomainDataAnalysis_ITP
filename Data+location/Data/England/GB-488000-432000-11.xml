		<title>11N.CAVE SCHOOL FAMILY EVENING</title>
		<content>    Every year at school we have a     
 family evening.  Usually our school   
 leavers compete against parents in    
 games of football, netball and a silly
 water race.   This year we are basing 
 it on the wild west.  The children in 
 the fourth year will be braves and    
 squaws and the adults will be cowboys.
 We're going to have a bonfire which my
 dad will be in charge of and we will  
 sing wild west songs.  Normally we    
 have a barbecue and roast ribs,       
 sausages and beefburgers.  There will 
 also be folk dancing and side shows.  
 The idea of the evening is for        
 families to enjoy themselves.         
 Although we sometimes have fund       
 raising events in school this isn't   
 meant to be one of them.. However     
 nearly Â£200 profit was made and       
 everyone had lots of fun.
