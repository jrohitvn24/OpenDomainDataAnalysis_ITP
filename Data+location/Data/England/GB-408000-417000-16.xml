		<title>16SEWAGE DUMP REFUSED</title>
		<content>  Calderdale Council proposed to build 
 an additional refuse and sewage dump  
 in {Outlane.} The local residents     
 decided to fight them. The proposed   
 dumping would mean 250 tonnes being   
 dumped each week, needing 10 wagons a 
 day to do this. The sludge would be   
 dumped over fields and crops. Although
 12% of lime would be added to combat  
 the smell it was not thought to be    
 completely effective.                 
  250 people attended an action meeting
 in{Sowood}to plan how to fight these  
 proposals, a further 2000 people      
 signed an objection petition. The     
 Halifax health inspector also spoke   
 against the council's proposal because
 of the flies and vermin it would      
 attract. Finally, on July 9th,        
 planning permission for the proposed  
 sewage scheme was unanimously refused.
 The residents had won!                </content>
