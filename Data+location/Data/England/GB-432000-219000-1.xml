		<title>01AN IMPRESSION OF CHARLBURY</title>
		<content>  Charlbury is an old market town in   
the Evenlode Valley. It is surrounded  
by small villages and hamlets,and is,  
itself,on the edge of Wychwood Forest. 
  The local stone is a rich honey      
colour and was used for building the   
Cotswold stone houses we can see today.
At nearby Stonesfield are quarries for 
Stonesfield slates which were used for 
roofing material from early times.     
  Through the centre of this area run  
the railway line from Worcester to     
Oxford -the Cotswold Line-, and the    
River Evenlode.                        
  The landscape is undulating with     
woods,hedges and drystone walls all    
around.The impression is that this area
is entirely rural.                     
The population of Charlbury has grown  
quickly to about 4000,and new houses   
are on the outskirts of the town       
leaving the centre as it always was.   </content>
