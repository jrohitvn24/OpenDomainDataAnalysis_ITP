		<content> In the north-west of the area is the  
 centre of Ilkeston, composed of mainly
 Victorian and early 20th century      
 housing.  Portions have been          
 demolished for re-development.  This  
 area is surrounded by an area of early
 20th century terraced and             
 semi-detached houses which merge into 
 Victorian mansions and large 1920 &amp;   
 30's housing, and up-to-date housing. 
 These areas separate Ilkeston from    
 Kirk Hallam and here is the oldest    
 house we found, Jacobean, Little      
 Hallam Hall.  Kirk Hallam is mainly   
 estate housing, private and council   
 built, a mixture of terraced, semi-   
 and detached buildings, including old 
 people's bungalows and 3 storey blocks
 of flats.  Many council houses are    
 passing into private ownership.       
 Through the estate is a ribbon of     
 older houses round the church.        </content>
