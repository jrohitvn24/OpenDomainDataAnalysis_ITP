		<title>15THE MOTORWAY</title>
		<content> THE M56 MOTORWAY RUNS THROUGH A CORNER
 OF OUR AREA. IT IS PART OF THE        
 MOTORWAY SYSTEM WHICH LINKS THE M6 TO 
 NORTH WALES. IT WAS OPENED IN 1971 ON 
 SUNDAY FEBRUARY 21ST. BEFORE IT WAS   
 OPENED THERE WERE MANY ACCIDENTS ON   
 THE A56 IN HELSBY INVOLVING MANY      
 VEHICLES. SOME OF THESE ACCIDENTS WERE
 FATAL. IT WAS VERY DANGEROUS FOR      
 CHILDREN GOING TO SCHOOL. IT WAS      
 ESTIMATED THAT OVER 6,OOO VEHICLES A  
 DAY WERE PASSING THROUGH HELSBY. ON   
 SOME DAYS IT TOOK 1O-15 MINUTES TO    
 CROSS THE ROAD, HUGE QUEUES OF TRAFFIC
 BUILT UP. THERE WERE TRAFFIC JAMS     
 HEADING TOWARDS RUNCORN EVERYDAY. IT  
 WAS EXTREMELY NOISY.SO WE DECIDED TO  
 SEE WHAT IMPROVEMENT THE M56 HAD MADE 
 WE DECIDED TO DO A TRAFFIC SURVEY TO  
 SEE:                                  
 1. HOW MANY VEHICLES WERE TRAVELLING  
 ON THE MOTORWAY.                      </content>
