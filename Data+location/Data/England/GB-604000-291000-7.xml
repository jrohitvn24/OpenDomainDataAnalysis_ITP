		<content> Over a 100 contestants attended the   
 first Clay Pigeon Shoot at the White  
 Horse pub. There was some high        
 shooting by Mr. R. Howe, who won the  
 trophy in the Open event, only missing
 two pigeons.                          
 Ken Neal retired after being the      
 butcher in Old Buckenham for 36 years.
 Mr. Neal said "I only had two weeks   
 holiday in all that time."            
 Tom Coman has been a member of the Old
 and New Buckenham Royal British Legion
