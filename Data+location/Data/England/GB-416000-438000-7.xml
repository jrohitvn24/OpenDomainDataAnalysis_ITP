		<content> This is a contemporary domestic TV    
 serial about the everyday life of     
 families living in a farming area. It 
 is very realistic because it is not   
 exaggerated and shows the lives of    
 ordinary working class people.It is a 
 popular serial which has been shown   
 for half an hour,twice a week,for     
 several years.The outdoor scenes are  
 filmed in Esholt.The real village is  
 made up of a few dozen houses,a shop, 
 a pub,a church,and a memorial hall.The
 pub,called{The Woolpack}in the serial 
 is actually called the{Commercial Inn}
 The memorial hall is used for the     
 children's playgroup.The church and   
 houses are also used.Some of the      
 residents enjoy all the publicity that
 the programme brings.Esholt is a      
 regular call for tourist buses.But for
 others the tourists are a nuisance,   
 with the mess and litter they create. </content>
