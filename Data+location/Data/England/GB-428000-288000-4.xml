 couple,both aged about 70 and have no 
 children.They have lived in Old Arley 
 for over 18 years.Their home is       
 actually the church-school which has  
 been converted.                       
   They used to work as self-employed  
 hairdressers and had a shop in        
 Nuneaton. In their spare time they    
 walk, work in their garden,grow       
 vegetables and fruit,and Mrs Davies   
 knits and sews.Mr and Mrs Davies had a
 pet dog but it died of old age.They   
 watch television and like the theatre,
 but not public houses.                
  The house itself was built with the  
 church in 1287,and the colliery       
 started the school when families came 
 for jobs.Mr and Mrs Davies chose to   
 live in Old Arley because they wanted 
 to move away from town life and live  
 in the countryside.                   </content>
