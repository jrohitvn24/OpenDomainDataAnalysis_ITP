		<title>08SOCIAL CONCERNS LOCALLY</title>
		<content> Local farmers are worried about the   
 Common Market flooding the country    
 with food from other members and      
 Britain not being able to get rid of  
 its' surplus. Farmers in this area    
 are worried about high machine costs  
 and falling grain prices.Foreign      
 competition like Danish Bacon and     
 French Apples give cause for concern  
 as do other cheap imports.            
  Concern was expressed about the inner
 city unrest. They claim stubble       
 burning does not pollute the          
 atmosphere and are very worried about 
 the prospect of nuclear war.          
  Animal disease, especially that which
 can be spread by wildlife , and       
 vetenary charges are always a worry as
 is the weather. If it is dry, a great 
 deal of irrigation has to be done.    
 Reductions of Government grants would 
 also have a detrimental effect.       </content>
