		<content> There are quite a lot of farmers in   
 the area.The crops you are most       
 likely to see in the area are wheat,  
 barley,lucerne and peas.There is some 
 rough grazing land for cattle.Much of 
 the land in our area is farmland      
 although  the golf_course takes up 120
 acres.There are a number of farms     
 in Latchingdon and Fambridge.Wheat    
 seems  to be the  most common crop    
 there. We went to a farm to get this  
 information  for the Domesday_Survey  
 and on the farm we visited lucerne was
 grown. The owner was {Jack Clear}He   
 rents {76}acres.He has lived there    
 since  1958.Lucerne is a green crop   
 high in protein used for animal food.
