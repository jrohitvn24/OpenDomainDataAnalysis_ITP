		<title>09JOHN'S SUNDAY, BLEASDALE</title>
		<content> I get up about 7 o'clock on Sunday    
 morning and have breakfast.I help dad 
 milk the cow and then let the calf    
 suck.Then I go and feed the calves    
 with provin.I take the milk into      
 mum,it is warm and creamy.Mum puts the
 milk through a sile which strains the 
 dirt out of it.Then I go back to dad,I
 back the motor-bike out of the barn   
 and dad loads it with a bale of       
 straw.We go up to the cows and feed   
 them and check if any are calving.We  
 also give them treacle in a tub which 
 is full of vitamins.At 10 o'clock we  
 get ready to go to Chapel.I wear my   
 very best shirt.When we come home we  
 have dinner and my sister Claire feeds
 the cats.In the afternoon I go to     
 Sunday School,my friend Philip        
 sometimes comes with me.When we get   
 home we do the cows and have          
 supper,watch TV and go to bed.        </content>
