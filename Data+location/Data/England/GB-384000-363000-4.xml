		<title>04Eaton Sand Quarry,Congleton</title>
		<content>   It is situated two miles north of   
{Congleton. }Eleven years ago this land
 was farmland.  This 90 ft.deep quarry 
 was opened in 1974. It was owned by   
 Hinkleys and was later taken over by  
 Tilcon in 1980.  In 1984 it changed   
 hands again this time to B.T.R.  It is
 the largest quarry in Europe.         
   Eighty men work here. This may not  
 seem a lot but it only takes one man  
 to operate the computerised machinery 
 which controls 380 acres by pressing a
 few buttons. Most of the employees are
 lorry drivers who have 55 wagons to   
 drive.                                
   The sand is pumped from water which 
 is 60 ft.deep, then it is cleaned     
 and left to dry.  300 tons of sand per
 hour is produced from the quarry.  It 
 is used for anything from foundry work
 to face powder.
