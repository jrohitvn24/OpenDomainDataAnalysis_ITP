		<title>13Housing in the area.</title>
		<content> The square is basically a suburban    
 residential area.There is a mixture of
 housing types ranging from old        
 people's flats to detached houses and 
 from 17th Century houses to the most  
 modern of designs. Some houses are    
 council owned and others are owner    
 occupied. The St.Helier  Estate was   
 built in the 1930's and was originally
 the largest council owned estate in   
 the country.Tenants are now starting  
 to buy their houses from the council  
 and the are modernising them by adding
 porches, extensions and garages where 
 possible.The council have recently put
 in new windows and added bathrooms.   
 A small survey of 21 people showed    
 there was a variation in the length of
 residence, with 7 people having lived 
 in their houses for over 20 years.    
 New developments of private housing   
 are being built in the square.        </content>
