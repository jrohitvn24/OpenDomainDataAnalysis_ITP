		<content> We have sent out 40 questionaires to  
 the households main wage earner and   
 we have had 37 replies. 30 of them    
 were working and 2 of them were       
 retired. The other 5 were not         
 working. We thought that there would  
 be about 6 people who worked regulary 
 abroad but there were 13 people       
 altogether. 56% of the wage earners   
 worked at places over 10 miles away   
 from Ashton, 35% worked within 10     
 miles of Ashton and 3 people worked in
 Ashton. 2 of these work on the same   
 farm. Most people travel to work by   
 car. 2 by bus and 1 by train. Half the
 people in our survey work in the      
 chemical industries at Ellesmere Port 
 and Runcorn. Amazingly enough there is
 only 1 person who has a part time job.
