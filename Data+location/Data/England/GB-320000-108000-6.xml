		<title>06Typical farm,north Upottery.</title>
		<content>   On this small farm with a dairy herd
 of 60, no crop other than grass is    
 grown and the farmer swears by a 2:1:1
 type of fertiliser,convinced that a   
 higher amount of nitrogen gives       
 nothing but a temporary boost. He     
 makes all his own hay and silage,using
 his own machinery. His baler produces 
 the older square type of bale.,and he 
 uses no blower for drying his hay.    
   In principle, he is against the     
 destruction of hedges,since they      
 provide shelter for the cattle and a  
 home for wild-life,but confesses to   
 having removed one or two,where he had
 very small fields indeed. According to
 him,6 acres is the absolute minimum   
 size for working his machinery.       
   This is a farmer of the old type,who
 drove a tractor from the age of 7 and 
 escaped from academic instruction,with
 relief,as soon as he could!           </content>
