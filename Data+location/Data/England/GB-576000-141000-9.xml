		<title>09Coppicing Around Staplehurst</title>
		<content>   At West End Cottage to the west of  
 Staplehurst parish the Collins pursue 
 their occupation of fence making (or  
 coppicing). Mr.Collins has done this  
 work for some 35 years.He is called a 
 pale maker". There are also two other 
 people in the area who do this work.  
   Sweet chestnut is used because it is
 a hard wood that lasts. Straight poles
 are felled from trees with 10-12 years
 growth when they have a diameter of   
 4-5 inches at eye level. Mr.Collins   
 fells about three acres a year. He    
 splits the poles with a double sided  
 axe and points them on a chopping     
 block before taking them to be wired. 
   The wood is used on racetracks and  
 motorways. A well managed acre of     
 coppice can produce a mile of fencing 
 and a pale maker produces approximate-
 ly 100ft. of paling a day.Trees are   
 ready for coppicing at 14-18 years old</content>
