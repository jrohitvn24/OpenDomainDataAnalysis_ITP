		<content>    A large amount of the land in this 
block has been reclaimed from the sea, 
and is now intensively farmed. Market  
gardening is the main activity.        
    Hundred End Moss was originally a  
bog. In 1880 the Hesketh and           
Scarisbrick families built banks along 
the river,one from the South and one   
from the North,which ended at Hundred  
End Gutters. 100 years later,a local   
businessman,Mr.Godfrey Crook,built a   
bank 3/4 mile long to connect the      
previous two,and reclaimed 1100 acres  
of land. This reclamation has been     
closely followed by Dr.Johnson of      
Liverpool University,who was an        
advisor to Mr.Crook. This land is now  
classed as Grade 1 agricultural land,  
and there is less than 10 percent of   
all growing land under this            
classification.
