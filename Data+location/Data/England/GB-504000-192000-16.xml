		<content>   Watersmeet Centre, in the High      
 Street with adjacent parking, is a    
 small theatre. It can hold 481 people 
 and has room for a limited number of  
 wheelchairs. The Chess restaurant is  
 in the same building.Plays, musicals  
 and films are all shown there         
 and Discos are held for the under     
 18s.The Rickmansworth Players, the    
 Pinner and Hatch End Opera Society,   
 the Harrow Light Opera Company and the
 Three Rivers Music Society are only   
 a few of the amateur societies which  
 perform there.The programme is varied 
 to appeal to all age groups because   
 Watersmeet is a family theatre.       
   There is a Hockey Club, a Football  
 Club and a tennis club with twelve    
 courts, three of which are floodlit.  
 The William Penn Swimming Pool,owned
