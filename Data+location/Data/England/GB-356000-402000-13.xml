		<title>13Playground Games in Wigan</title>
		<content>In our school playground there are lots
of different games played. The girls   
like to skip or play "two balls". As we
skip we usually sing a rhyme. Here is  
one rhyme we sing:-                    
     Sally in the kitchen,             
     Doing a bit of stitching,         
     In came a bogey man,              
     And knocked Sally out.            
The boys like playing ball games like  
football and rugby. Cops and robbers is
also a popular game. In this game there
are two sides the cops and the robbers.
The robbers have to go and "rob a bank"
and the cops have to try and catch     
them.                                  
"Ticky" is also very popular. One      
person is "it" and he has to try to    
touch the other players. If he ticks   
them they are "it".
