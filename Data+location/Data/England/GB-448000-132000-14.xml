		<content>    The Mid-Hants Railway was opened in
 1865, one of the 3 lines that have run
 through the village. Despite          
 considerable opposition it was closed 
 in 1972.                              
    It became known as the{Watercress  
{Line}because the line runs through the
 area of Hampshire famous for its      
 Watercress beds. The collection of    
 Watercress from King's Worthy station 
 meant it could be swiftly delivered   
 nationwide.                           
    The{Springvale watercress beds,    
 39 in all, are fed by natural spring  
 water. Each bed is sown with 2.5lb of 
 seed. From seed to cutting takes 5    
 weeks. It is fed with fertiliser-basic
 slag, which is made of iron filings   
 which helps the cress to keep its     
 colour. If sown too thick the cress   
 goes 'hot' and is yellowish in colour.
