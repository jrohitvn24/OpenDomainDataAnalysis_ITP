		<content>MARBLES is a a complicated game with   
different rules.     If you are playing
Â£keeps' you keep the marble you hit. If
you are playing Â£friendlies' you don't.
Marbles come in five different         
sizes-normal,mini bomper,bomper,yank   
and super yank.There are different     
names for the colours such as cat's    
eyes,frenchies,beach ball,whirls,and   
duck-eggs.If a marble hits someones    
shoe you say Â£boots' and have an extra 
go. There are many ways to win a       
marble such as flicks,rolling or pixie 
bombs, when you lift the marble and    
throw it in.
