		<content>   This area has a wide variety of     
 charities which includes branches of  
 national and international            
 organisations such as Oxfam and the   
 Red Cross as well as over thirty      
 different help groups that cater for  
 the local community. These include    
 homes and clubs for the elderly,      
 disabled and handicapped. Some        
 charities provide facilities while    
 others concentrate on fund raising eg 
 the Purley Rotary Club.               
   One successful way of raising money 
 is through a nearly-new shop. MIND has
 a shop in Purley which accepts good   
 clothes, beds and toys from people who
 are given two-thirds of the selling   
 price.                                
   Cards made by mentally ill          
 patients are sold and flag days held. 
   MIND runs a club for people         
 recovering from mental illness.       </content>
