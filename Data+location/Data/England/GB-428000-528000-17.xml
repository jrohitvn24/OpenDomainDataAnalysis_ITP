		<title>17Chiltonaires Jazzband.</title>
		<content>   The Chiltonaires Jazzband has       
 nothing to do with dancing or pop     
 music. We march in strict formation   
 wearing our uniforms while playing    
 tunes on our kazoos and keeping time  
 on the drums.                         
   We wear a skirt of royal tartan, a  
 black jacket, white gym shoes and     
 socks, tartan tams and black sashes.  
 The mace twirlers and mascot wear red 
 jackets and black busbies with        
 artificial plumes.                    
   On Saturdays we travel on hired     
 buses to go to competitions where we  
 win medals to display on our sashes.  
   We practice every Monday and Wednes 
 day at half past five.                
   We enjoy the jazzband immensely. I  
 have been a member for five years and 
 Margaret joined a year and a half ago.
