		<title>08DEADMAN'S DINGLE</title>
		<content>  {Deadman's Dingle}is an old tale     
 which we found out from someone in    
{Picklescott.}It is a little place just
 outside{Woolstaston.}                 
   The tale is that many years ago a   
 man fell in a dingle when it was      
 snowing and was covered up for a few  
 days.                                 
   When they found him he was dead.    
   The trouble was that the dingle was 
 right in the middle of the boundary   
 between two parishes,so they were     
 arguing which one should bury him. In 
 the end neither of them would bury    
 him,so he was left there.             
   Now it is said that he haunts the   
 place where he died.                  
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
