		<title>07A Typical Day for Mr.Walker</title>
		<content> Mr Walker,the Countryside Interpretive
 Officer,is a very busy man during the 
 summer because there are many school  
 parties for him to take round the     
 nature trails.Some parties are from as
 far away as Hull,Goole or             
 Doncaster.Before Mr Walker takes the  
 parties round he has to check the     
 trails to see if there have been any  
 changes in the wildlife since his last
 survey.Mr Walker tells visitors what  
 to look for and how to find things    
 like birds' nests,animals' homes or   
 rare plants. The ecology of the park  
 can also be studied by visitors making
 their own way around the nature trails
 by using the illustrative guides that 
 have been drawn up by the Countryside 
 Interpretive Service.
