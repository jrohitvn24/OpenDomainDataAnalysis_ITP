		<content> The director told us most counties    
 have a Scout centre with a hut and    
 some grass but"Kent went one better"  
 with a{conference block}with cooking  
 and sleeping places for Winter. They  
 also built their own{swimming pool}in 
 1952,it was the first one open to the 
 public in the Medway Towns.It is now  
 used for{canoe lessons.}They also have
 an international{B.M.X.}track,{Go_Kart
 track,{archery,absailling, tennis,}an 
{assault course} &lt;built by the army>,  
{roller skating}rink,{5_a_sidefootball 
 and will have a small zoo.The centre  
 is open to the public and some times  
 200 children go daily for a week.     
 There is a{bunk house}with 6 bunks for
 scouts who come late at night.        
 A few years ago a scout got lost in   
 the{woods}for 2 days,it couldn't      
 happen to_day because he would just   
 listen for the sound of the{motorway. </content>
