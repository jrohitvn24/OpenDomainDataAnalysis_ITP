		<title>13WINDMILLS</title>
		<content> An outstanding feature on the skyline 
 of the South Downs are the windmills  
 called "Jack and Jill". We interviewed
 a member of the Windmill Society who  
 gave us much interesting information. 
 Jill was reputedly built in Brighton  
 in 1821 and moved by a team of 8O oxen
 in one piece to its present position  
 alongside Jack in 1852. The society is
 restoring Jill as a working example.  
 Each Saturday a group of voluntary    
 workers restore the mill as exactly as
 possible to the original plan.        
 Interesting graffiti have been found  
 such as the names of 4 workers who all
 decided to join the army in 1917.     
 Another comment hidden behind a timber
 shows that the centre pole was        
 replaced in 1852. So far restoration  
 has cost nearly Â£3O,OOO. One sail cost
 Â£1OOO. The mill, reopened in 1982, had
 4OOO sightseers in one month.         </content>
