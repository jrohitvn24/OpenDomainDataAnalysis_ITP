		<content>{Bulldog}is a game we often play at    
 school. You need about 20 people to   
 start with. The person who is on      
 stands in the middle of two lines     
 about 15 metres apart. The person who 
 is on calls out someones name, that   
 person has to run to the other line   
 without been tug. If he is tug he     
 joins the person who is on and the    
 process is repeated.                  
{Ring a ring o' roses}is a very old    
 game which originated after the great 
 plague which covered the country in   
 1664. People carried posies of flowers
 over their mouths to stop them        
 catching the plague. As children say  
 the rhyme they do the actions too:    
 Ring a ring o' roses,                 
 A pocket full of posies,              
 Atishoo, Atishoo,                     
 We all fall down.
