		<title>11THE MILL HOUSE AT GLYNDE</title>
		<content> The Mill House stands on a hill above 
 the quarry. It is in Glynde village   
 but in the parish of Beddingham. The  
 owner told us that it had been a      
 windmill for grinding corn. She has   
 lived there with her family for more  
 than 20 years and has put in          
 electricity and running water. The    
 family have added two extra bedrooms  
 and a living room and have built walls
 with flints from the Downs. When they 
 were making a swimming pool they found
 two whole mill stones and part of     
 another. These now form the steps of  
 the pool. The view from the house had 
 attracted the owner to Glynde and she 
 found it a friendly and happy place,  
 because everyone knows everyone else. 
 It is not too cut off because of the  
 railway and the County Rider Bus      
 Service. For entertainment there is an
 annual flower show and a silver band. </content>
