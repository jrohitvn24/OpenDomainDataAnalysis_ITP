		<title>16Memories-Mrs.Bradley,Lydden</title>
		<content>Although this interview contains much  
historical information we feel that it 
is worthy of inclusion as it stands.   
On June 26th Emma,Clive,Daniel and Mr. 
Marshall visited Mrs.Bradley who lives 
at 57,Canterbury Rd,Lydden.Mrs.Bradley 
has lived in Lydden for 80 years.She   
was born in 1905.Mrs.Bradley remembers 
quite vividly the Peace Day            
celebrations of May 12th 1919.The      
children marched to a meadow at Bell   
Farm carrying Union flags.There were   
all kinds of activities.The farmers put
up swings in four big elm trees.There  
were races for those of 70 years and   
over.The men raced for the white linen 
cloths which covered the tables and the
ladies raced for the big brown tea     
pots.The adults sat at the tables for  
tea whilst the children sat on the     
grass.                                 
                                       </content>
