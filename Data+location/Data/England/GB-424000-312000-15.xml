		<title>15Little Liverpool</title>
		<content>   Little Liverpool is situated to the 
 south-west of Coton-in-the-Elms and   
 1.5km north west of Lullington. It    
 consists of a group of about 3 houses.
   Residents believe the area derived  
 its name from a group of sailors,     
 originally from Liverpool. They are   
 thought to have sailed up the R. Trent
 and from there headed towards Botany  
 Bay.They decided to settle in the     
 vicinity and the name Little Liverpool
 was retained.                         
   Grafton House, just south of Little 
 Liverpool was the local spa.          
 Unfortunately the wells were filled in
 with the arrival of a mains water     
 supply in the 1940's.
