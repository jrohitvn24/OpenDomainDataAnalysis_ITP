		<title>11A day in the life of Timothy</title>
		<content>I wake up at half past four, get       
dressed and run down to have breakfast 
then I play with my toy farm and go    
outside for two hours helping my dad.  
I come in and have a second breakfast. 
I get ready for school and wait outside
for Tom, when he comes we get in the   
car and go to pick Nicky and his       
sister up. We come to school and wait  
for the door to be opened. We go into  
assembly and after that we usually do  
Maths and English. At twelve oclock we 
go into the hall for dinner and then   
we go out to play.  We do craft or     
topic work in the afternoon.  At a     
quarter to four it is home time.  We   
get in the car and go home, we get     
changed and have tea, go outside for   
an hour then watch television till     
bedtime.                               
                                       
Timothy is nine years old.             </content>
