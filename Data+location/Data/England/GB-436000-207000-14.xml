		<title>14Leisure Activities</title>
		<content> The most time consuming form of       
leisure activity was watching the T.V. 
We investigated how much time children 
spent watching and found a wide range  
of times. About a third watched T.V.   
for less than an hour. Another third   
watched for about two hours. The       
remaining third were the addicts and   
watched for at least four hours.       
 Only half the children read at some   
time most evenings, but about 80% of   
parents did some reading each evening. 
 Only a few dads went to the pub most  
nights but more than 50% went about    
once a week.                           
 Most parents went out to dinner       
"occasionally" but did go out most     
weeks for varied leisure activities.   
 None of the parents went to any       
evening classes. About 10% of children 
were members of clubs such as Scouts,  
Brownies, Boy's Brigade.               </content>
