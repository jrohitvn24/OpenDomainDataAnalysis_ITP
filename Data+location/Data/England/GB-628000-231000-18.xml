 The Felixstowe Dock has the largest   
work-force in the district, including  
dockers, lorry-drivers, Customs        
Officials, Shipping Line personnel,    
Dock Security (they have their own     
Police Force) and all the Office       
workers and cleaners for the Dock      
Company itself, apart from those       
working for the individual forwarding  
companies and all the associated repair
and maintenance needed.                
 Sangamo's employ a considerable number
of people.                             
 Not all of these workers live locally 
by any means.  Many travel into the    
area daily from Ipswich and beyond     
while many local people travel just as 
far to their place of work.  Compared  
to other parts of Suffolk there is a   
lower level of unemployment and several
families have moved here to find work. </content>
