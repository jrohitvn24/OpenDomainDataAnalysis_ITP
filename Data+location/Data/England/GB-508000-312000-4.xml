		<content> This is a quiet,{rural community}where
 changes,if any,take place slowly. The 
{population}has a close relationship   
 with each other and many families have
 lived here for generations. Outsiders 
 are treated in a friendly and polite  
 manner but are not totally intergrated
 until about 20 years have passed. Many
 of the trades and occupations are     
 connected with the land, but some new 
 businesses have been set up           
 e.g.printing;mail order car parts. The
{social life}tends to centre around the
 pub and church, W.I. and school fetes.
 There is very little of entertaining  
 of friends in private houses.         
 The biggest change has been the       
 establishment of a{private school}    
 catering for about 400 children who   
 come from a radius of 40 miles. The   
 school is the biggest employer in the 
 village but some animosity exists.    </content>
