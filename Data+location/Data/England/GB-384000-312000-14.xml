		<content>BOATS REGULARLY PASSED THROUGH THE     
VILLAGE CARRYING RAW UNSWEETENED CHOCO-
LATE FOR CADBURYS FACTORY AT KNIGHTON. 
LOCAL BOYS WOULD TEASE THE BOATMEN IN  
THE HOPE THAT THEY WOULD THROW CHUNKS  
OF RAW CHOCOLATE AT THEM.WHEN HAY WAS  
CARRIED ON THE BOATS,AN EXTENSION WAS  
FITTED TO THE RUDDER SO THAT THE BARGEE
COULD SIT ON TOP OF THE PILED UP HAY   
AND STEER.                             
THE BOATS MOORED ALONG THE SIDE OF THE 
CANAL HAVE A REGISTERED NUMBER,JUST    
LIKE MOTOR VEHICLES.TAX HAS TO BE PAID 
TO THE WATERWAYS BOARD BEFORE YOU CAN  
PUT A BOAT ON A CANAL.                 
AFTER PASSING THE WAREHOUSE THE CANAL  
CROSSES OVER THE VILLAGE BROOK.THE     
BUILDING YOU CAN SEE BELOW THE CANAL IS
THE VILLAGE SCOUT AND GUIDE HUT.       
THE DERELICT LOCK COTTAGE WAS DESIGNED 
BY THOMAS TELFORD.THERE IS A CENTRAL   
CHIMNEY WITH ROOMS ARRANGED ROUND IT.  </content>
