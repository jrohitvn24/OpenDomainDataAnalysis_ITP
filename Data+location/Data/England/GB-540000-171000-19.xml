		<title>19RELIGION IN NEW ELTHAM</title>
		<content>                                       
Children from Wyborne School asked     
local people about their religions.    
                                       
Most people who regularly attend a     
place of worship go to the Church of   
England.  Some people attend  Roman    
Catholic Churches. There are very few  
Jewish people in the area and hardly   
any with Hindu or Moslem beliefs.      
Greenwich is probably the area of      
London with the smallest number of     
Hindus and Moslem and New Eltham,in    
the South Eastern corner of Greenwich, 
is perhaps the part with the smallest  
proportion of minority religions.      
Lots of people do not seem to be very  
interested in religions. .             
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
