		<title>03THE OLD SCHOOL</title>
		<content>  The old school was built one hundred 
 and thirteen years ago by the Mary    
 Wheatley Trust to educate village     
 children. It consisted of two         
 classrooms two storeys high and was   
 used for one hundred years as a       
 school.                               
  The Collins family who bought it did 
 most of the conversion themselves and 
 put in a floor to give them four      
 bedrooms upstairs, whch are lit by    
 flat windows set in the roof.         
  One of the classrooms is now a living
 room downstairs and the other one is  
 divided into three smaller rooms. They
 also installed central heating.       
  Outside they filled in the bottom of 
 the large windows and roughcast the   
 outside brickwork.                    
  They removed the small toilets and   
 used them to grow flowers in outside.
