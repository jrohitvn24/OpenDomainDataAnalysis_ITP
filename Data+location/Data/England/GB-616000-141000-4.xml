		<title>04A DAY IN MY LIFE</title>
		<content>   Today, I got up at half past seven.I
 got dressed in my school uniform and  
 ate my porridge. After that Mummy put 
 my hair up, then my sister and I got  
 in the car and mummy drove us to      
 school.                               
   First, we went in the hall and      
 had assembly. Then we went in the     
 classroom and wrote a story. Before   
 that we had a radio programme and we  
 sang songs. After we had movement and 
 drama, we had dinner and I had        
 sandwiches, peppermint creams and     
 crisps. Then we went outside to       
 play.aftre a while the teacher blew   
 the whistle and we went inside. Then  
 we practised for Sports Day: we ran,  
 skipped and did the relay race. Then  
 we went inside and did some           
 mathematics. After school we played   
 rounders and then I went home and Lisa
 came to play and we went swimming.    </content>
