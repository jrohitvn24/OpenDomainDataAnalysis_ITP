		<title>07EVENTS IN KEYINGHAM</title>
		<content> The village social calendar is made up
 of events throughout the year, which  
 are common to both villages. The main 
 one in each village being the annual  
 gala, which in Ottringham is really a 
 major even attracting people from     
 far-a-field. Many things revolve      
 around the churches, with Spring      
 fares, Harvest festivals, Christmas   
 fares and many more. Outside church   
 associations there are in both        
 villages groups and individuals that  
 spend the year holding fund raising   
 events for charity, these would take  
 the form of sponsored events, sales of
 home produced goods, jumble sales an  
 even door to door collections of      
 money. Some purely social events -    
 dances, parties, bar-b-q's and coach  
 trips for a day or evening out are    
 also organised.
