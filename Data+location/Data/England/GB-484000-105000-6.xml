		<content>  Shopping within the city is a mixture
 of old &amp; new, housed in  predominantly
 old  buildings. There  are  family    
 businesses that have been here for    
 many years and branches of regional &amp; 
 national companies. {Smurthwaites }in 
 North Street,  established  over  200 
 years, has recently been taken over by
 C.Brewer. {Arthur Purchase  &amp;  Son,   
 wine merchants, has  been  established
 since  1780.  In the residential areas
 beyond the city walls are  local shops
 to meet  the immediate needs  of the  
 residents of {Summersdale,  Parklands,
{St.Pancras, Spitalfield Lane,Portfield
 and{ Broyle }areas. The autumn of 1985
 will  see  the  opening  of  a  new   
{Sainsbury's Superstore }about 2km from
 the  city  centre. This  has  received
 opposition from local traders who feel
 city centre trade will suffer.  Others
 feel  it  will  be  of  great benefit.</content>
