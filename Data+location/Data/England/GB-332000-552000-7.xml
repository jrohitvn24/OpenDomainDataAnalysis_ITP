		<title>07Great Orton School</title>
		<content> Great Orton school was built in 1859  
 by Sir Walter Brisco and purchased by 
 the school board in 1874. It was      
 named Great Orton County Primary      
 School in 1957. The school has 2 class
 rooms, a junior cloakroom &amp; a cloak-  
 room/play area for the infants. The   
 sandstone building is well cared for  
 and in spite of its age has many      
 modern facilities. It has its own     
 canteen producing a well-balanced     
 snack meal at a reasonable price. At  
 the bottom of the school field are 2  
 large paved buildings open at the     
 front which serve as play areas in    
 inclement weather. Originally the     
 earth closets were at the end of the  
 field but this is now a PE store. In  
 1985 there are 46 children, vertically
 grouped and taught by 2.5 members of  
 staff. Children are taught in groups  
 or work individually at their own pace</content>
