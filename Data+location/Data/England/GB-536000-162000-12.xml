		<title>12MY HORSE CHAMP</title>
		<content>     My name is Fiona Watson and I have
 a pet horse and his name is Champ.We  
 ride him and groom him  every day.    
 Sometimes we even go to a show, but we
 don't show him we just go in for      
 gymkana events and jumping. So far we 
  have got twenty -five rossettes. My  
 mum rides Champ and she has won two   
 jumping rossettes. I have been in some
 jumping competitions on Champ; but I  
 did not come anywhere .When we go home
 we feed him 'Molly Chaff' and 'Country
 Mix and we groom him again and get the
 sweat off then we let him out in the  
 field. On school days we leave the    
 stables at 9.00 p.m. At the stables   
 there is a horse called Lucy and there
 is a girl in our class called Lucy. We
 keep our horse at Pear Tree Farm in   
 Featherbed Lane. Champ is chestnut    
 gelding with flaxind mane and tail.
