		<title>01CHANGES IN SCAMPTON VILLAGE</title>
		<content> Scampton village is bordered on the   
 West, by a lime stone ridge which runs
 all the way to Lincoln and on the East
 by the River Till. It is bordered on  
 the South by Till Bridge Lane which is
 an old Roman road. The Northern       
 boundary is the next village which is 
 called Aisthorpe. The old Jurassic    
 road used to run all along the lime   
 stone ridge but R.A.F. Scampton spread
 and covered part of the road.         
    There was never a pottery in       
 Scampton nor a village green. Most    
 people kept pigs but only about five  
 people kept cows. When Christmas time 
 came most people killed their pigs.   
    There were very few houses in      
 Scampton 50 years ago it was mostly   
 grass and fields which ran all the way
 to Lincoln.
