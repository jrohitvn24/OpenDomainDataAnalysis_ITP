		<title>01Camberley - an Overview</title>
		<content>{Camberley}is the largest community in 
 the Borough of Surrey Heath. It lies  
 where the A30 road crosses the valley 
 of the{River Blackwater.              
                                       
 The proximity of an entry point to the
{M3 Motorway}has led to an enormous    
 expansion of the population as it is  
 within{commuter distance}of London.   
                                       
 To cope with this influx, the old town
 has been gutted and re-equipped with a
 new shopping precinct, rail station,  
 leisure centre and numerous schools.  
                                       
 Camberley is also the home of the     
{Royal Military Academy,}and of the    
 Staff College of the Army.            
                                       
 Although much of the{heathland}has    
 been built on, much remains and is    
 used as firing ranges.                </content>
