		<content>    Although there is no village or    
 social centre, there is a strong comm-
 unity spirit amongst the established  
 residents. This encompasses both young
 and old and seems to generate from    
 two main sources:the farming community
 and long-term familiarity.            
    In this farming community all      
 members of a family tend to work or at
 least help out on the farm, especially
 during busy periods. Farmers and their
 families also help neighbours in diff-
 icult times eg. poor weather in 1985  
 caused problems in harvesting and so  
 they helped each other during the few 
 dry periods to gather in crops.       
    Many people have spent most of     
 their lives in this community and know
 each other's families. Often the      
 children of one family help the old of
 another family when a basic need      
 arises.                               </content>
