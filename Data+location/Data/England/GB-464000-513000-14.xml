		<title>14SCATTERED HOUSING</title>
		<content> 1THERE IS NO NEW HOUSING BUT MANY OF  
 THE HOUSES IN STANGHOW ARE BRICK BUILT
 AND OF MODERN DESIGN. TWO BUNGALOWS AT
 MARGROVE PARK ARE ALSO OF FAIRLY      
 MODERN DESIGN. AT STANGHOW MOST OF THE
 HOUSES HAVE AN INDIVIDUAL APPEARANCE. 
 THE SCATTERED FARM HOUSES ARE OFTEN   
 OCCUPIED BY PEOPLE WHO DO NOT FARM THE
 LAND. SOME OF THE FARM HOUSES AT      
 STANGHOW ARE RATHER DILAPIDATED, AND  
 THE HOUSE AT KATERIDDEN IS DERELICT.  
 NEAR THE RESERVOIR AT LOCKWOOD BECK A 
 STONE BUILT COTTAGE IS OCCUPIED BY THE
 GAME KEEPER, AND THE BUNGALOW BY THE  
 WATER BAILIFF.                        
 AT SLAPEWATH THE HOUSES WERE          
 ORIGINALLY BRICK-BUILT RAILWAY        
 COTTAGES AND A STONE BUILT            
 STATIONMASTER'S HOUSE. SOME OF THE    
 FARMHOUSES ARE STONE-BUILT AND OTHERS 
 ARE BRICK-BUILT.
