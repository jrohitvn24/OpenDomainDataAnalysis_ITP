		<content>  Shenstone Brick and Pipeworks is     
a builders merchants supplying to local
builders and to anywhere in Great      
Britain.                               
  It is situated at the junction of two
busy main roads being the A.5 and the  
A.5127 which is locally known as Wall  
Island.                                
  They no longer actually make the     
bricks here but the two original kilns 
which were used for firing can still be
seen on the site.                      
  There are 26 people employed here,   
9 women and 17 men.                    
  The company was formed in 1926       
when clay was discovered on the site   
but in 1967 it was changed to a        
builders merchants which is what it is 
at present.                            
  There is a showroom and trade counter
and anything which is used for making  
a house can be purchased here.         </content>
