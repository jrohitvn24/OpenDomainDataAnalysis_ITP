		<content> The village has a very active social  
 life and claims to have nearly 40     
 clubs and societies catering for all  
 ages,ranging from the Playgroup to the
 Friendship Club for the Elderly.There 
 is also a highly successful"twinning" 
 scheme with the village of St.Vigor Le
 Grand in Normandy involving regular   
 exchange visits.Almost 50% of the     
 interviewees in a sample survey       
 belonged to at least one village      
 society.                              
 The Village Association coordinates   
 many of the activities.It promotes    
 social events such as dances,the      
 summer fete,barbecues,etc. and,in so  
 doing,helps to bring together the"old"
 and"new"villagers.The Association owns
 a minibus which regularly takes       
 elderly residents to Eastleigh for    
 shopping and daily picks up doctor's  
 prescriptions for the housebound.     </content>
