		<title>16Power: Oil/Nuclear</title>
		<content>{Oil} is a fossil fuel which is found  
deep underground, even beneath the sea 
bed. The oil is pumped from the well to
refineries where it is seperated into  
different grades. It can be used for   
{heating, cooking, cars and industry.} 
{Nuclear power} produces heat by       
splitting atoms, as in nuclear bombs.  
This heat is used as a source of energy
to produce electricity. Experiments are
currently going ahead to generate heat 
by fusing atoms together. This will    
have the advantage of not leaving a    
radio-active waste product. There is   
much concern that oil will not last    
much longer, that nuclear energy may be
harmful and that coal is difficult and 
dangerous to extract. {Alternative     
sources of energy} are being sought.   
Wind power and water power are popular 
ideas, but they are not yet good enough
for commercial use.                    </content>
