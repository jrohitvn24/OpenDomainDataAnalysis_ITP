		<content>     The recently-elected church warden
 has lived in the village for seven    
 years.{The Parish of Weeton St Michael
 has a population of almost 2,500.     
     Sunday{congregations}are small,   
 over 30 in the morning and about a    
 dozen in the evening. Special         
 services, such as the monthly family  
 service and the Harvest Festival, are 
 better attended. On Plough Sunday,    
 ploughs are taken into the school     
 playground and blessed. Easter        
 communicants number about 150.        
 Financial giving is increasing.       
     The church remains a{focal point} 
{of rural life}and is well-supported   
 even by those who are not regular     
 church-goers. Every year, a Garden    
 Party and Christmas Fair are held.    
     There is a{joint service}each year
 with the local Roman Catholic church.
