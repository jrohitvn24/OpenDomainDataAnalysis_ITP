		<title>07THE NEW LAINDON WEST CENTRE</title>
		<content>{Basildon Corporation}were responsible 
 for building the{Laindon West         
{Community Centre.}However the people  
 who use the centre and the            
 volunteers who work there feel that a 
 new centre is needed.The old building 
 needs lots of repairs. The walls are  
 cracking, the toilets overflow, the   
 floors are badly damaged. Mr. Blake,  
 the secretary of the centre, says that
 the entire building needs to be pulled
 down.It will cost{Â£245,000}to build a 
 new centre.The council have agreed to 
 contribute{Â£145,000}and a brewery     
 have given a loan of{Â£55,000. Â£50,000 
 is still needed and an Action Group   
 has been set up to raise this money.  
 One of the fund raising activities has
 been a sponsored press-up event. This 
 event raised{Â£250.}The rest of the    
 money will be needed by September.
