		<title>06WINGRAVE'S POPULATION</title>
		<content>     The population of the village     
has grown a lot in the past 10 years.  
The main reason for increase has       
been the building of a housing estate. 
This has increased the population by   
around 220 people.                     
     Many houses have been built       
around the village including a small   
estate by the church.  The population  
now stands at about 1000 people.  Most 
people are adults but there about 350  
children under 16.                     
     Most people work outside the      
village but about 20% work in          
Wingrave.  Not many people have moved  
out of the village over the years.     
     Quite a lot of people have        
relatves in the village and donÂ£t want 
to move.
