		<content> People travel to our school in lots of
 different ways.For example, there are 
 people who walk ,cycle and come by car
 and bus.In the school there are 96    
 children ageing from 4 to 11 years    
 old. Our headmaster teaches us for all
 subjects,but he doesn't teach us on   
 Mondays,Tuesday mornings and Fridays. 
 Also there are 3 part time teachers.  
 They include Miss Greenwood, who      
 teaches us on Mondays,Tuesdays and    
 Fridays,Mrs Dell and Mrs Hartley.There
 are two full time teachers who are Mr.
 Lee and Miss Camps.We have no hall but
 we have quite a few sports facilities.
 We have a swimming pool and we have   
 house points.We have had a computer   
 for less than a year,and we have a    
 library.Our school is quite old and is
 built of granite.Our hours are 9 to 12
 and 1.30 to 3.30.
