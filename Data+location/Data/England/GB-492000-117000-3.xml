		<title>03A DAY IN MY LIFE</title>
		<content>   After breakfast I go to school on   
 the school bus.  When we get there we 
 have sums on the board and do more    
 maths after these.  We have play for  
 15 minutes and I play with Henry the  
 rabbit.  After play we do more maths  
 or English until lunch.  I have a     
 packed lunch. The next play is the    
 longest one.  The afternoon play is   
 the shortest one and lasts for 10     
 minutes.  We have the register again  
 in the afternoon and 30 minutes of    
 quiet reading and we might read or    
 talk about our books to our teacher.  
 The we do Art, P.E. Music or Topic.   
 We finish with a story and go home at 
 3.10  At home I help Mum with my new  
 baby sister.                          
                                       
                                       
{                                      
{                                      </content>
