		<title>13THE BRICK KILNS.</title>
		<content>   The brick kilns near Hindhay Farm   
 are no longer in use, but the         
 buildings that remain are over 100    
 years old. The area is similar to an  
 old and derelict building site. It has
 been fenced off for safety reasons,   
 but it is still possible to see how   
 the buildings were arranged. The Kilns
 had moss growing over them, and the   
 roof timbers were rotting away. The   
 doors had fallen off their hinges,    
 hanging by a thread like a wobbly     
 tooth. The buildings looked very      
 delicate, as though they would crumble
 should a mouse move inside.           
   It was easy to imagine the kilns in 
 use; the hustle and bustle, and the   
 smell. Nearby there is a clay pit, and
 it is probable that many local people 
 relied on these for their livelihood. 
 Now the peace of this once busy site, 
 is the home for wild life.            </content>
