		<title>09NEWS - SCHOOL OPENING</title>
		<content>  On the 22nd March our{school opening 
 was opened officially by the Bishop of
 Colchester. We invited Patrick        
 Appleford the song writer and the     
 Mayor of Colchester. We had a service 
 with singing and prayers. Afterwards  
 the Bishop talked to us about when he 
 went to Africa to teach the children  
 and how they had to write on slates.  
 After the service the parents were    
 allowed a cup of tea and a few        
 biscuits. Then they had a look round  
 our new school and our work. Later    
 Kathryn, Mark, Patrick and Jeff       
 planted a tree at the front of the    
 school. Just after the service twelve 
 girls did some dancing for us and     
 everybody liked them.
