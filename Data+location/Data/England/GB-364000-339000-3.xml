 Saint Peters church is 800 years old, 
 it was last restored in 1801.Since the
 new Rector arrived the building has   
 been restored by young people for the 
 Redundant Church Fund. The most       
 valuable part is known as the Corbet  
 Chapel.In here it is very dusty,a bit 
 smelly and wood has rotted.You can see
 a stained glass window with all sorts 
 of lovely colours.The window shows the
 crests of the Corbet family who owned 
 the area years ago.At the moment they 
 have replaced the tower roof,cleaned  
 all the pews and repaired carved wood 
 work.Some of the money to repair the  
 church comes from the Church Fete and 
 the annual Harvest Auction.Some walls 
 have been repapered.The Church yard is
 now kept much tidier too.             </content>
