		<title>15An Appraisal,Ravensthorpe.</title>
		<content> An appraisal of Ravensthorpe was comp-
leted by the Parish Council in l983.The
questionnaire returned by 74% of house-
holds revealed an overall picture of a 
village whose residents found it peace-
ful,friendly,unspoilt and picturesque. 
It is near to a town with good rail and
road links and newcomers are received  
well.Concerns were expressed about     
speeding vehicles and large lorries    
passing through;an imbalance in the    
housing mix with too many executive    
type houses;the lack of gas,primary    
school,extra shops,public transport and
a doctor's surgery;lastly fouled foot- 
paths and verges with attendant litter.
However a close study left the         
impression that the majority think well
of their village.The Chairman asked for
help to keep village life alive-support
local traders,attend village events and
serve on committees which need support.</content>
