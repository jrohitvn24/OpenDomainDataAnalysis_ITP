		<title>10FOOD IN NORTH YATE</title>
		<content> Almost everybody buys most of their   
 food from Tesco's, the big            
 supermarket in the shopping centre.   
 Quite a lot of people grow some       
 of their own food, particularly       
 fruit and vegetables. One person in   
 the area  manages to grow all of      
 these in their garden: beans,potatoes,
 cucumber,lettuce,parsnip,apricots,    
 peaches,onions,raspberries,rhubarb,   
 peppers and aubergines. Not many      
 people keep animals, but a few keep   
 hens or ducks for eggs, or goats      
 for milk. Most people now own a       
 freezer. The usual time for the main  
 meal of the day is early evening,     
 about 6.00pm. Brown bread is much more
 popular than white bread in this area.
 A lot of families regard their Sunday 
 roast dinner as the favourite meal of 
 the week. Most people go out to eat no
 more than twice a month.              </content>
