		<title>10Improving our Area: Kirkby</title>
		<content> Results of a survey conducted by J4.  
 We asked some children in our school  
 to say what they would like done to   
 improve the area in which they live.  
 This is a list of what they said:     
 1) More street bins to lessen litter  
 2) More street cleaners               
 3) Provide more doctor's surgeries, as
 people have to travel quite a long way
 for attention                         
 4) Dog Wardens should come round daily
 as there are so many dogs roaming     
 round and they frighten the little    
 children                              
 5) More policemen on the beat         
 6) More facilities for young children 
 7) Fence round and clean up the River 
    Alt                                
 8) Improve employment prospects by    
 encouraging firms to come into the    
 area                                  
 9) More clubs for teenagers.          </content>
