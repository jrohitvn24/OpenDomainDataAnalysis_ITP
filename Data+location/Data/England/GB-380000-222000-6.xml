		<title>06LOCAL HISTORY OF SANDHURST</title>
		<content>EVIDENCE OF THE PAST                   
 Sandhurst actually appears in the     
original Domesday Book as SANHER and   
there are many 12th and 13th century   
references too. The name probably means
Â£a sandy hurst or hill', referring to  
its site. Fish pools were built by     
monks near what is now Bengrove Farm.  
 There is evidence of Roman occupation 
near Sandhurst Hill and local legend   
has it that they Â£fished for mussels'in
the Severn near the present Mussel End.
 Queen Elizabeth I granted the rights  
for a ferry across the river between   
Ashleworth Quay and the road to Brawn  
Farm, this no longer operates.         
 Moat Farm still shows evidence of a   
medieval moat around the site.         
 In Maisemore parish west of the river,
the land was owned by the Church Com-  
missioners until the 1940s when Chargy 
and Overton Farms were sold to tenants.</content>
