		<content> Most of the farms in our block are    
 dairy farms which grow crops and      
 pasture for the animal feed.Some also 
 have sheep,pigs or beef cattle.One    
 farm specialises in egg production and
 at another they buy in horses to train
 them for hunting and competition work,
 before selling them.The farmers rear  
 their own cattle, but pigs and poultry
 are bought in.Milk production goes to 
 B'ham Cooperative Society.The animals 
 are sold at Cheltenham and            
 Kidderminster Markets.                
 Most of the farms have been managed by
 the same family for generations and   
 the farmers hope this will continue.  
 The Wythall Young Farmers Club is very
 active in its concern for the         
 environment.{Silvermead}
