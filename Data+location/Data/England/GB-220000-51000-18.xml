		<title>18ECOLOGY:THE KILMINORTH WOOD</title>
		<content> This is the only real wood in our     
 block.It is part of the ancient woods 
 around the Looe estuary.It is managed 
 by Caradon District Council and Looe  
 Comprehensive School and it is a      
 Conservation Site.There are nature    
 trails through the wood.There is an   
 ancient earthwork in the wood called  
 the Giant's Hedge.This was a boundary 
 around a Cornish chieftain's lands    
 and it runs from Looe to Lerryn.The   
 main tree in the wood is the oak.There
 are also ash,birch and willow trees   
 which are native and beech,sycamore   
 and sweet chestnut which were planted.
 There are also hawthorn,hazel and     
 holly trees.There are spring flowers  
 like bluebells,wood anemenes and      
 primroses.There are also wood sorrel, 
 cow wheat and enchanters night shade. 
 We saw whortleberries(called "hurts"  
 in Cornwall)and honeysuckle{(see P.19)</content>
