		<title>01RURAL AREA OF THE SOUTH HAMS</title>
		<content> This block, which is very typical of  
 the hinterland of the South Hams Area 
 of Devon, lying as it does between the
 cliff-lined coast and the swelling    
 uplands of Dartmoor, consists of an   
 upland plateau 400 to 500 feet high,  
 divided by deep narrow combes, well   
 wooded, and each with its little      
 stream, hurrying down to the sea.     
 Other than in the combes trees are    
 sparse and 95 per cent at least of the
 area is grassland, devoted in the main
 to sheep, but with about 30 per cent  
 cattle. Land under cereals amounts to 
 no more than 5 per cent. The block has
 only one hamlet, Brownston, very      
 small, but pre-norman. Twentieth      
 century incursions into the area      
 consist of one petrol filling station 
 on the site of the Old Smithy and     
 three caravan sites, though many of   
 the farms take in summer visitors.    </content>
