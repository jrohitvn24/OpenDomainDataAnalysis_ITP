		<title>01INTRODUCTION TO KEYINGHAM</title>
		<content> This area encloses two villages       
 Keyingham and Ottringham, both dating 
 back before the original Domesday book
 of 1086. Both villages are relatively 
 undeveloped although being situated on
 a very busy East Coast road between   
 the city of Hull and the mainly       
 tourist resort of Withernsea. Nestling
 amid some of the most agriculturally  
 productive land of Holderness, these  
 two villages are regarded as country  
 backwaters by town inhabitants,       
 whereas in reality they are pleasant  
 friendly places with a great sense of 
 community spirit, a haven from the    
 'rat race' of city life.
