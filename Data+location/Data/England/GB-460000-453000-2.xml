 Old people's memories of World War 2. 
 We went to the hospital to ask old    
 people what they did during the war.  
 One person said that he was a truck   
 driver carrying weapons.I asked what  
 it was like on V.E.Day.He said people 
 were dancing,street lights were       
 switched on and everybody was eating  
 and drinking. Another person had been 
 in the jungle and was still fighting  
 when the European war ended;he was    
 nearly killed by a bomb. One man was  
 just a school boy.An old lady had     
 driven an ambulance.She said if you   
 had a spare room in your house it     
 mustn't be left empty,you had to let  
 someone live there.Another old lady   
 came to our school during the war and 
 helped to fill sandbags before the    
 school term started in 1939.
