		<content>Mrs. M. has lived in the area for 15   
years and believed Bury had not changed
noticeably except for an increase in   
poplation.                             
Mrs. M's childhood had been happy but  
she had not made full use of her       
opportunities at school. She thought   
that schools had become more informal  
than they were in the 1960's. She said 
that there were more subjects and      
better equipment nowadays. She thought 
more money needed to be spent to keep  
standards up. As Mrs. M. moved house   
several times she went to a number of  
different schools:                     
Great Barstead Primary, Bagholt        
Primary, Lamarsh Primary, Bacton       
Modern and Gilbert County Technical.   
Mrs. M. now enjoys her life as a house 
wife as she has a lot af machines to   
help her around the house.
