		<title>10PASTORAL CARE - EGMERE AREA</title>
		<content> Seven-eighths of the area is within   
 the{Parish of Wells-next-the-Sea},    
 administered by the Rev. W. Sayer. The
 rest is in the{South Creake Living}of 
 Rev. L.Gedge. Inhabitants go to church
 either in Wells - five miles distant -
 or at Waterden Church, just outside   
 the area. Most of the inhabitants say 
 they are{Church of England}and feel   
 that visits from their priests are    
 welcome.{Rural clergymen}have to      
 travel often to administer their      
 parishes. Their work includes visits  
 to the sick and the taking of Mass to 
 the home of any incapable of attending
 church. Historically, in 1900 an      
 ex-railway carriage provided a place  
 to worship. One man tells that he was 
 christened in it. Later the Earl of   
 Leicester built the Egmere Institute  
 which was used for worship. This has  
 since ceased.                         </content>
