		<content> For a small town Worksop has a variety
 of shops. It has branches of the      
 national chains such as Boots,        
 Woolworths, W.H.Smith, Marks and      
 Spencer, Mothercare, Halfords.        
                                       
 There are two large supermarket chains
 in the town, Hillards in the market   
 place and Tesco on its own hypermarket
 site on the outskirts.                
                                       
 Worksop has a flourishing market at   
 weekends and on several weekdays.     
                                       
 Lacking in the town is a department   
 store and a toyshop. Most Worksop     
 shoppers visit Sheffield.
