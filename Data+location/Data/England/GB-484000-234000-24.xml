<title>24Update on the Energy Park</title>

<content>



The Energy park was a nice idea, but once the initial buildings were completed the enthusiasm for it seemed to wither &amp; die. Yes there were houses with lots of good insulation that provided a showcase, but the giant Wind Turbine on the site never worked properly &amp; it was so noisy that the neighbours complained until it was demolished a few years later, after being idle for several years.&lt;br />&lt;br />Its just another housing estate now.   &lt;br />
