		<content> We did some surveys with the children 
 in our Junior School. We have about   
 300 children and most of them have    
 moved here from all over the United   
 Kingdom and other parts of the World. 
 Only 85 were born in Hiltingbury      
 itself.                               
                                       
 We asked the children about their     
 Hobbies, their Pets, if they had a    
 Computer, their favourite T.V.        
 programme, their favourite Colour and 
 their favourite book.
