 A large proportion stated that they   
 only do the necessary weeding and lawn
 -mowing;around two hours per week.A   
 few adults with larger gardens or     
 allotments do a great deal more.      
   Apart from a 5% sample who are      
 renovating older property,most adults 
 do only minor Do-It-Yourself jobs.    
 Pensioners generally prefer to use a  
 familiar local tradesman.             
 Hobbies listed in the survey included 
 keeping pigeons and poultry,cooking,  
 dancing,photography,playing cards,    
 sewing and embroidery,beer brewing,   
 caravaning,collecting antiques,bingo, 
 singing,playing records and philately.
    Almost all active adults walk for  
 pleasure and exercise.Swimming is a   
 distant second in popularity,followed 
 by keep-fit,badminton,bowls,cycling,  
 golf,squash and water-skiing.         </content>
