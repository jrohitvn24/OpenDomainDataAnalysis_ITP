Offley Marsh Methodist Chapel is a red 
brick building built in 1875.  Services
are held fortnightly.  Its Minister    
looks after 4 chapels.  The average    
congregation is 16 people, which       
includes 2 teenagers but no children.  
There are no Children's services or    
Youth Club.  People with young children
go to larger chapels where these       
facilities are available.  The         
congregation live within 1 mile of the 
chapel.  It has a Canadian pedal organ 
which is considered unusual.  The      
Chapel's finances are described as     
being "in very good order" and "their  
future is in no danger".
