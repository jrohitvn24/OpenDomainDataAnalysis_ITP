		<title>09ROADS AND ROAD TRANSPORT</title>
		<content>  Our Domesday block is quite well     
 served by a good network of roads.It  
 has trunk roads which deals with the  
 main traffic,and secondary roads which
 serve the smaller settlements and     
 carry lighter traffic.                
 The main trunk road in our block is   
 the A650.Over the last 30 years there 
 has been a lot of controversy about   
 the A650 and the proposed building of 
 the AIRE VALLEY TRUNK ROAD.Some people
 are opposed to the plans because they 
 say the environment and natural       
 habitat of wild animals would be      
 spoiled.The other side of the argument
 is that the AIRE VALLEY TRUNK ROAD    
 would take the strain off the         
 A650,which is very busy at times.     
 Whatever the reasons the fact still   
 remains that the road has still not   
 been built and seems likely to stay   
 that way for a few years at least.    </content>
