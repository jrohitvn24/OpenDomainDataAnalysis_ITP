		<content>{OXBRIDGE}in some parts it is untidy   
 and in some other parts it is very    
 tidy.                                 
{GRANGEFIELD }consists of council and  
 private houses and it is fairly tidy. 
{FAIRFIELD }has no council houses but  
 does have large old houses and modern 
 houses. It is a very tidy area with a 
 few amenities e.g. phones, playgroups,
 schools, shops, street lights, playing
 fields and play areas etc. Fairfield  
 is, I think, the most tidy and well   
 kept area in Stockton. It also has an 
 old railway which was disused a few   
 years ago but has now been turned into
 a cycle track. The roads in one part  
 of Fairfield are Almond Gr., Autumn   
 Gr., Witton Rd., Orchard Rd., The     
 chase, Blackthorn Gr., Birbrise Rd.,  
 and Lime Gr. This area used to be a   
 large orchard hence the names.
