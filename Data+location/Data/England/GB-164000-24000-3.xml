		<title>03EVENTS-BREACHING LOE BAR</title>
		<content> In December 1984 the Bar  was breached
 for only the third time in one hundred
 years.The Loe Pool level rose until   
 Penrose walks were underwater.The adit
 from the pool to the sea was old and  
 the pipes were always breaking and    
 getting blocked up.The South West     
 Water Authority dug a channel through 
 the bar to let the water drain away.  
 It was twenty feet deep and was       
 scooped out by mechanical diggers and 
 bulldozers.                           
 Many local people were not impressed  
 because the Pool level dropped twenty 
 feet and salt water mixed into the    
 Pools fresh water.The sand barrier    
 pushed up by the S.W.W.A to stop this 
 happening was washed away.People were 
 afraid that the plant and animal life 
 of the Pool would be ruined by        
 seawater.The operation cost Â£17,000.
