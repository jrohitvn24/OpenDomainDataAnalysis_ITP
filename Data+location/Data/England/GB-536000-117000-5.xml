		<title>05The Hooke Estate Chailey</title>
		<content> Major Tillard ons the Hooke Estate    
 which covers about one third of       
 Chailey. He showed the children from  
 St Peters C.E. Primary around the     
 Estate and they saw many interesting  
 things.                               
 Major Tillard has carefully planted   
 the woodland so oak trees will take   
 over once the fir trees are cut down. 
 He has planted a new tree whereever an
 old one has had to be felled. Young   
 trees are all protected by special    
 guards. In one place the hedge has    
 been layered to take place of a wire  
 fence. Two ponds have been cleared in 
 order that pond life may thrive. All  
 the very wet land has been left alone 
 and orchids are growing on one wet    
 patch.Even overhead electric cables   
 are marked so wild birds will not fly 
 into them.                            
                                       </content>
