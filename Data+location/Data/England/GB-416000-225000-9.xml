		<content> There are four schools within the     
 D-block. There is an Infant School    
 in Stow catering for  5-7 year-olds   
 and a Junior School for the 8-11 age  
 range. These are both County Schools  
 and the buildings date from 1897 for  
 the Infants and 1901 for the Juniors, 
 although they were originally         
 all-age.While they are substantially  
 built, they lack the benefit of modern
 educational thinking and plumbing! The
 Infant School was designed for 120    
 boys when it was built and the Junior 
 School for 288 girls and infants, but 
 it is unlikely that these numbers were
 ever realised. In 1907 the average    
 attendance was 90 boys, 80 girls and  
 80 infants. Now the numbers are       
 between 60 and 70 at both schools,    
 practically half what it was twenty   
 years ago.                            
  At age 11 children transfer to either</content>
