		<content> The major part of industry is related 
to warehousing and the storage of      
goods.Ross Foods and Coca Cola are     
based on the Walsall Road.The container
base on the College Road is one of six 
inland ports based in this country.    
Goods are cleared here by customs      
ready  for shipping abroad or          
distribution in the U.K.The base       
employs about 200 local people and     
deals with approx.250 lorries a        
day.There are two Karricons;these      
are used for lifting the containers off
the lorries in order to stack them     
before processing.Goods ranging from   
sewing needles to London taxis are     
shipped to all parts of the world from 
this port.A small part of this port is 
used for the storage of new cars ready 
for export.Other firms are Unigate     
Dairies,Harris Dry Cleaners,Mellerware 
and Douglas Construction.              </content>
