		<title>03An old Whittlesey house</title>
		<content>  No 45 Church Street was built in 1820
 in the local georgian type style.     
  The southern half was built first and
 has ornate plaster mouldings on the   
 downstairs ceilings.  The northern    
 half was built later (it has no ornate
 plaster mouldings) and was used as    
 servants quarters. It has 11 rooms,   
 98 panes of glass and 14 doors (not   
 including cupboard doors).            
  The largest room measures about 21.97
 metres square, while the smallest one 
 measures about 11.04 metres square.   
  Most of the upstairs ceilings are    
 made of lathe, reed and plaster.The   
 bricks used were made locally. Local  
 Collyweston slate, now replaced with  
 grey welsh slates on the roof. Stables
 are situated at the back of house.    
  We know the house was a vicarage an  
 art school and a day school. It is now
 a private house.                      </content>
