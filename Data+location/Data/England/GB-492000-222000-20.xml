		<title>20NEIGHBOURHOOD WATCH</title>
		<content>  The Neighbourhood Watch was started  
 in Billington because the nearest     
 police are at Leighton Buzzard and    
 people felt that more protection was  
 needed.                               
  The aims of the Neighbourhood Watch  
 are to deter criminals, to establish  
 community spirit, to protect by mutual
 cooperation, to inform the coordinator
 or police of anything suspicious. This
 is not a vigilante scheme.            
  In Billington at the moment there is 
 a coordinator and 6 other members who 
 each watch an area. There is regular  
 communication within the group and    
 also with the police.                 
  Last summer when the rapist called   
 'The Fox' was seen in the area people 
 became scared. The Neighbourhood Watch
 was called many times when suspicious 
 characters  had been seen and the     
 police were called.                   </content>
