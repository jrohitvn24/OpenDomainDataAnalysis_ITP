		<title>04Afton Farm - Berry Pomeroy</title>
		<content> Afton Farm belongs to the Duke of     
 Somerset, but Mr and Mrs Moule rent   
 it. They have many animals such as    
 South Devon Cattle, Cornwall and Devon
 Longwool Sheep anf Highland Sussex    
 chickens.                             
 The land is worth approximately half a
 million pounds. Some of the land is   
 used for growing crops such as        
 wheat, mangolds, swedes, cabbages and 
 potatoes.                             
 Mr and Mrs Moule also make their own  
 milk and cream which they sell to     
 passers-by.                           
 The chickens lay between 1 and 5 eggs 
 per week, these eggs are free range.  
 The machines in use on the farm cost  
 around Â£6000 each. They cannot be very
 large because the lanes which lead to 
 the fields are too narrow.
