		<content>  Most of the area is hilly land which 
 grows unprofitable crops as it is     
 affected by altitude,climate,rocks and
 gradient.The only vegetation able to  
 survive are bracken,heather and coarse
 grasses.                              
  Much of the  land is millstone grit  
  which is impermeable and therefore   
 prone to flooding although the slopes 
 lessen this.The land tends to be very 
 waterlogged in Winter and Spring and  
 usually very dry in summer.           
  The farms situated above 900 feet in 
 altitude,are mostly sheep or dairy    
 farms as the land is useless for      
 growing crops.Below 900 feet on the   
 gentler slopes,the farms are mainly   
 Dairy or Beef farms because the ground
 is more level with good grazing land  
 which can also be used for hay or     
 silage.
