		<title>14CAMBERLOT HALL - A STORY</title>
		<content> On July 21st 1944, on a combat mission
to Oberpfaffenhofen in Germany, an     
airman of the 392nd Bomb Group of the  
United States Airforce was in trouble !
 His Liberator was badly flak damaged  
over the target and was managing to    
limp back to the English coastline and 
was desparate to land. The Lieutenant  
found a runway and this was later (30th
April 1984) to be established as       
Deanland airfield.                     
 The aircraft had to land without      
permission on a small fighter field    
under construction with labourers      
laying perforated steel planking. As   
the plane landed a landing strut broke 
off and the aircraft groundlooped at   
over 100mph and one of the wings sliced
through the conrol tower. The aircraft 
stopped just before a downhill slope   
into a gully ! For this the pilot was  
awarded the Â£Silver Star'.             </content>
