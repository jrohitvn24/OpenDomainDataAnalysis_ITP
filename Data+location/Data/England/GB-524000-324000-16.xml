		<title>16THE SPALDING SEWAGE WORKS</title>
		<content>    The works were opened in 1980 at a 
 cost of Â£5.3m. The works were built   
 here because of the closeness of the  
 industrial area and the River Wellend 
 into which the treated water is       
 pumped. They receive a lot of effluent
 from Smedleys and British Sugar for   
 treatment.                            
    The sewage gets to the works by a  
 series of gravity sewers and pumping  
 mains. This network of pipes is laid  
 underground all over Spalding. Because
 of the flat nature of the area 63     
 pumping stations are used to convey   
 the sewage along the pipes to the     
 treatment works. The works receive    
 about 1,320,000 gallons of sewage a   
 day but during periods of heavy rain  
 fall this may increase to 3,300,000   
 gallons. The works treat sewage from  
 Spalding Town and Pinchbeck Village.
