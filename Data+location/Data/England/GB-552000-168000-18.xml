		<title>18Housing in Swanley Village</title>
		<content>  Swanley Village is 1 1/2 miles from  
Swanley Town.Most houses are           
pre-victorian but all housing types can
be found.The most interesting is the   
old college,parts were built in the    
13th Century.We were allowed to go     
inside,there is a gallery all around   
like a balcony,and part of the roof    
structure is supposed to be 600yrs old.
There is a big open fire-place and the 
gentleman showed us a piece of wattle  
and daub.It is made out of sticks,     
manure and dried mud.There was a trap  
door leading to the cellar,with 15     
steps going down.The ideal temperature 
for a cellar is 60deg F and ideal to   
store food.                            
  It was a very interesting house and  
well looked after.It seemed strange to 
be looking at a house in 1985 that was 
built nearly 600yrs ago.
