 Thoughts for the future-Claire Cray 11
 yrs old.I don't think there will be   
 many job opportunities unless you are 
 good with computers.They will be runn-
 ing things.Computers aren't bad things
 but they don't do much for employment.
 I don't think women will have any more
 equal opportunities in the future than
 they have now.I'd like to be a dancer.</content>
