		<content> The landscape is pastoral in this old 
 agricultural heartland. Small fields  
 slope gently from North to South ,    
 bounded by ancient Cornish hedges,and 
 roll away to a horizon ringed by the  
 high lands of Dartmoor,Bodmin Moor and
 Hingston Downs which hide the Tamar   
 estuary from view.Coniferous forests  
 are visible Eastwards,copses and      
 orchards lie within the area, and the 
 hedgerows of mixed species make       
 ribbons of colour throughout the year.
 Spacious farmhouses and outbuildings  
 of local stone with slate roofs are   
 flanked by modern animal units.Many   
 houses date from the 13th. Century,as 
 does St.Sampsons Church at South Hill.
 Several have original features intact.
 Manaton farm,built on the site of a   
 monastery,is mentioned in the original
 Domesday book.
