		<title>13ANCIENT BRITISH CAMPSITES</title>
		<content> The whole area is covered with remains
 of Ancient British Campsites. By far  
 the most accessible is the one at     
 Brough law. On no other site are the  
 boundaries so well defined. One other 
 large site is that of Greaves' Ash.   
 Despite the site being close to a     
 well-trodden tourist path, very few   
 people ever visit this site. This is  
 probably because so much attention is 
 focussed on Brough law. Nearly every  
 other hill has remains on it though   
 these remains are difficult to find   
 being mostly covered by thick moorland
 vegetation.It is thought that the     
 population of this area 2000 yrs ago  
 must have far exceeded the population 
 of the area as it stands today.
