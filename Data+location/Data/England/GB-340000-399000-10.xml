		<title>10Housing in Kirkby</title>
		<content> Kirkby is a relatively new town.      
 Therefore, most of the houses are     
 quite modern. In our block the        
 majority of houses are rented         
 accomodation, being either council    
 houses or flats. There is less home   
 ownership in this area. Opposite our  
 school there are several blocks of    
 high flats . Around the station there 
 are some new housing estates and the  
 houses on them are semi-detached.     
 There are also detatched houses,      
 bungalows and maisonettes. There are  
 some estates which are about a 100    
 years old. They remind us of what     
 Kirkby must have been like before it  
 was developed.
