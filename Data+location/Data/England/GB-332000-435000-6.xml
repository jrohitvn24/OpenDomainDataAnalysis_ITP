		<title>06Housing in Staining  Class 3</title>
		<content>Housing covers about 1/4 of the whole  
of our block. It is divided into the   
four main types:Detached,Semi-detached 
Terraced or Bungalows. In the Eastern  
half of our block most people live in  
detached or semi-detached houses but in
Western half of the block there are    
more terraced houses.  There are very  
few blocks of flats in our block. Such 
as there are tend to be expensive ones 
rising to two or three levels. They    
tend to be privately owned as is most  
of housing in the area. There is one   
large housing estate called Grange     
Park. This is a Council estate. Most   
of the children who worked on this     
item in the survey live in semi-det    
houses with gardens front and back and 
a garage. These houses are owner       
occupied as are nearly all the homes in
our village. Most of our houses were   
built in the 1960s but some are 18thC. </content>
