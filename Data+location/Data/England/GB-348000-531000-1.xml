		<title>01REVIEW:NORTHWEST PENRITH</title>
		<content> The area to the North West of Penrith 
 is predominantly agricultural land.   
 However it contains several important 
 communications arteries,the M6        
 Motorway,the main London_Glasgow      
 Railway and the old A6 trunk road.Even
 in Roman times a road ran from their  
 fort at BROCAVVM(Brougham), close to  
 the modern A66, to the fort at VOREDA 
 and then onwards to Carlisle.the river
 Petteril,one of the tributaries of the
 river Eden,meanders through the area. 
 There are several overhead power lines
 running through. There are both       
 private &amp; Council Housing Estates on  
 the North West outskirts of the Town, 
 an agreeable Golf Course,and a        
 hospitable country pub.The northern   
 outskirts of the town comprise a      
 number of Housing Schemes,both        
 Council_owned and privately developed.
