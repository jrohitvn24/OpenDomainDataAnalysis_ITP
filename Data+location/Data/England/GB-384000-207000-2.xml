		<title>02Public Transport / Badgers</title>
		<content> Public transport is of great concern  
 to people in this block.Whiteshill,   
 Slad and Painswick all have bus       
 services ,but over the last few last  
 years they  have been greatly cut     
 back,mostly to only 2 services a day. 
 There is great concern over the       
 governments  bill for privatisation   
 of the buses,which many people think  
 will mean loss of bus services.On     
 certain days of the week the County   
 Council runs a community bus to Stroud
 for shopping.This is very popular with
 mothers with young children,elderly   
 people and those without transport.   
                                       
  People are worried that badgers could
 die out in the Pitchcombe area due to 
 Ministry control and illegal trapping 
 In 1982 gassing was carried out.Now   
 this is not so but badgers are still  
 affected by Ministry Control.         </content>
