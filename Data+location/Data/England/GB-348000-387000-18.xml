		<content>{Housing}The general view of housing is
 that of an urban area which has       
 steadily grown around the village, and
 has gained momentum in recent years.  
{Privately owned}We questioned 69      
 households, 67 of which owned their   
 own houses. On average each house had 
 3 bedrooms. All had a garden, most of 
 medium size, on which they planted a  
 lawn and flower beds, few grew food.  
 55 of the houses had full central     
 heating, and 33 had either full or    
 partial double glazing. Most owners   
 repaired their own property with the  
 help of a contractor for big repairs. 
{Rented houses}There are two small     
 areas of council owned property in the
 village. One unusually timber built.  
 The few people we spoke to from there 
 said their homes were well maintained.
