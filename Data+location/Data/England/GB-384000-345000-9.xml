		<content>St.Giles' and St.George's school Rose  
Queen is elected by her classmates     
from the last year of the infants      
school.The coronation in the Queen's   
gardens is followed by a concert in    
what is a big day for a 7 year old.    
This year's Queen,Sally Royle,writes:" 
When I was Rose Queen I was embarrassed
but I liked  it.My dress was designed  
by the lady down Barracks Road.I       
enjoyed the concert.I liked the        
costumes the children were wearing.The 
concert was very good."                
Lesley Sigley (1984) felt very proud to
be the Queen of the school as she led  
her retinue around the gardens.Nioka   
Dean (1983)was amazed to be elected.   
Heather Kuduk (1982) was very nervous. 
Sarah Pitt (1981) enjoyed it but       
complained that she had to stand       
throughout the concert.
