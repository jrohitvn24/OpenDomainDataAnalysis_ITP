		<title>20LOOKING AT YEOFORD'S FUTURE.</title>
		<content> This area is, at the moment, a very   
 peaceful place with lovely views. It  
 is mainly concerned with agriculture  
 since the closing, a few years ago, of
 the sawmills. It has the one shop, the
 school, a railway station, a telephone
 kiosk and three pillar boxes. There   
 are, however three building sites.    
 This could mean over seventy extra    
 houses. How will the area cope with   
 the extra people? Will the school have
 enough room? What will the children do
 in their spare time? How will the     
 lanes cope with the extra traffic?    
 Yeoford is at a time of change. We    
 hope it will not spoil the area. The  
 children of Yeoford School have       
 thoroughly enjoyed working on the     
 Domesday Project. Twenty seven        
 children took part. The youngest was  
 eight and the eldest was eleven. Most 
 of the children live in the area.     </content>
