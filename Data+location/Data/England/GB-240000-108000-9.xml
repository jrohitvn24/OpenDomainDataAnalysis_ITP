		<content> The farm supports a family of 5,the   
 grandfather(working) and a relief     
 milker.                               
 The Quance family have owned it since 
 1840, having purchased it from the    
 Fortescue Estate.There are 90 acres   
 with another 200 nearby.              
 Dairy cattle(Friesians), calves, two  
 bulls and breeding ewes are kept.Pigs 
 were kept until 10 years ago but      
 became unprofitable.                  
 In summer cattle are out at grass, in 
 winter housed in barns.Milk is        
 collected by tankers from the         
 Torrington milk factory.Stock is      
 bought and sold at Holsworthy market. 
 Grass is the main crop.Barley is      
 grown.Weeds are controlled by         
 chemicals and artificial fertilizers  
 used.                                 
 A barn was destroyed by fire two years
 ago.                                  </content>
