		<title>08A HOUSEWIFE'S DAY</title>
		<content> My husband is a farmworker on Needwood
 House Estate.  We have 2 children age 
 7 and 9 and live in rent and rate free
 accommodation.                        
                                       
 I get up at 7.50 am, and get the      
 children ready to take them by car to 
 school for 8.50 calling at the village
 shop on the way home.  Morning spent  
 on household chores and preparing hot 
 mid-day meal.  Shopping or pottering  
 in garden in the afternoon before I   
 collect children from school at 3.30, 
 then ferry them to after-school       
 activities.                           
                                       
 From 6 to 9 pm I do market research by
 telephone, putting children to bed    
 about 8.30. Then an hour's writing    
 until 10 pm when I relax - and so to  
 bed.                                  
                                       </content>
