 Of the 32 bedrooms,many of which are  
 in the extension on the back of the   
 building,two are in the original

 ceilings. The original building also  
 includes two lounges and a bar which  
 is open to non _ residents.

 bathroom and the hotel is generally   
 fully booked in the summer. It is
