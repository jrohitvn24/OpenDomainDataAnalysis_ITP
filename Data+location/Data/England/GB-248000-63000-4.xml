		<title>04Farm Mechanisation.</title>
		<content>  Mechanisation on the farms has caused
 a fall in the number of employed on   
 the estate. Machines are growing in   
 size and versatillity making farming  
 far more economical and time saving.  
 Devon country lanes which provide     
 access to the fields remain the same  
 so there is a limit to the size of    
 machinery that can be used in the     
 forseeable future.                    
  The first tractor appeared on the    
 estate in 1934, spares were hard to   
 come by so when a front wheel         
 collapsed it had to be replaced by a  
 home-made wooden one.In 1947 a        
 Ferguson tractor cost Â£430. Recently  
 the estate has just replaced its      
 tractors with six Deutz machines each 
 costing around Â£27,000.
