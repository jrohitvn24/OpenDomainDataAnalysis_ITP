		<content>{SIR SACHEVERELL SITWELL:}Known in     
 Weston as Sachi, is the youngest of   
 the talented family of Sir George     
 Sitwell.  A result of the family love 
 of art &amp; literature the trio were a   
 formidible force in artiistic  circles
 from 1915-1950.  Osbert &amp; Edith were  
 both known for their modernity &amp;      
 eccentricity in poetry &amp; prose &amp;      
 worked with Sir William Walton on the 
 ballets Facade &amp; Belshazzar's Feast.  
 Sachi's work was more studious but    
 much ahead of his time; closely allied
 to music &amp; art he remains a leading   
 authority on Mozart &amp; Liszt. With the 
 years his work showed an increasing   
 tendency towards the macabre. Now 88  
 years, he resides at Weston Hall &amp; has
 become somewhat of a recluse through  
 ill-health &amp; inclination.  His younger
 son, Francis &amp; family joined him at   
 the Hall.                             </content>
