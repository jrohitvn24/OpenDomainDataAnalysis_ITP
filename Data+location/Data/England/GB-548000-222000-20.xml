		<title>20The work of our Curate.</title>
		<content> We asked our Curate to come to school 
 and tell us about his life in the     
 village.He leads a very busy life and 
 has little spare time.He told us that 
 the work of a priest is about God and 
 People.His life is broken down into   
 three areas:-                         
 1.{Worshipping God}- which involves   
    services,prayers,baptisms,weddings 
    and funerals.                      
 2.{Working with people}- attending    
    schools,sport and social clubs,    
    helping the sick and listening to  
    people's problems.                 
 3.{Administration and Study}- writing 
    sermons,attending parochial and    
    church meetings,answering letters, 
    going on training courses and read-
    ing theological books.             
 Christmas and Easter are very busy for
 him with extra services but August is 
 quieter as people go away on holiday. </content>
