		<content> I got up at 7.06 a.m. for my breakfast
 and had bacon and sausage sandwiches, 
 then I watched the telly for 35       
 minutes. After I had got washed I got 
 dressed. After my lunch Thomas Kevin  
 and I went to buy some bubble gum.    
 Then we collected pop cans. We went   
 all around the Boundary Court shops,  
 the park, Hundred Acre Road, Valley   
 Road, Goodwood Drive, Bankside        
 Crescent, then Laneside Avenue. When  
 we had finished we had 135 cans.
