		<title>07A DAY IN MY SCHOOL LIFE</title>
		<content> I wake up as my Dad comes in and      
 switches my light on.He tells me to   
 get out of bed.Five minutes later I   
 get up and dress into my school       
 uniform,tie,jumper,shirt and          
 trousers.I jump on my brother and wake
 him up.I drag him out of bed and tell 
 him to get dressed.                   
 Meanwhile I clean my teeth and have a 
 wash.Quickly I go down stairs,make my 
 sandwiches and pack my lunch-box.My   
 Dad comes down stairs and gets the    
 ladies breakfast(we own a rest home.) 
 At twenty past eight I get my shoes   
 and coat on.My Dad drives me to the   
 bus stop to catch the L68 to school.I 
 get off the bus and walk to           
 school.After school which usually     
 consists of maths and english I walk  
 home. When I get home I have my tea   
 and then watch T.V.till 9'O clock then
 I read till 10'O clock.               </content>
