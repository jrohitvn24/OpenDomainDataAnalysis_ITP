		<title>06A DAY IN MY LIFE</title>
		<content> Mum, Dad and I get up at 8 o,clock and
 I put the kettle on for morning       
 coffee.Mum and Bru, walk me to school,
 there the day starts as I walk through
 the gates and go onto the playground  
 where I wait for the bell to ring.We  
 have a big hall,large pleasant        
 classrooms,playing fields all around  
 us ,and we have our own swimming pool.
 We are kept very busy at school with  
 many clubs at lunch time and after    
 school.I am pretty tired when I get   
 home.                                 
       I usually watch television until
 it is time for tea. Most evenings I am
 very busy as I have French lessons,   
 belong to the swimming club and go to 
 Tap dancing lessons.                  
       I am ready for bed when I tumble
 in at 8 o,clock.                      
                                       
                                       </content>
