		<content> New machines are always being invented
 and becoming readily available either 
 for business purposes or enjoyment.   
 Some of the household ones are{       
{dishwashers},{washing machines,       
{tumble dryers, freezers and home      
{computers. }The dishwasher and washing
 machine are largish box-shaped        
 machines which do what their name     
 suggests, wash dishes or clothes.     
 Tumble dryers dry the clothes by      
 spinning them in warm air.   This     
 dries them quicker than by hanging    
 them on the line.  Freezers are used  
 to store large quantities of frozen   
 meat and vegetables.  This way food   
 stays fresh and can be used at any    
 time.  These unlike computers are easy
 to use.  Home computers can be        
 programmed to do what you want them to
 do.  They are mostly used for games   
 and word processing in offices.       </content>
