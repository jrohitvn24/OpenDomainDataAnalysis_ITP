		<content> THE KENNELS, continued from page 6    
 Mr. and Mrs. Crane started the kennels
 themselves 13 years ago. The areas    
 that they take dogs in from are       
 Gloucester and the surrounding        
 district. They have only refused to   
 take a dog in once and that was       
 because it was old and very vicious.  
 They have one part-time worker who is 
 on a Youth Traing Scheme. Every       
 morning after breakfast the dogs are  
 exercised in the paddock, one at a    
 time. While the dogs are exercising,  
 their kennel is cleaned.              
 Dogs generally stay at the kennels for
 a period of 14-21 days while their    
 owners are on holiday abroad. They    
 leave the dogs behind to avoid having 
 to leave them in quarantine when they 
 come back from abroad. This is to try 
 to keep the disease Rabies out of the 
 country.                              </content>
