		<content> Both{Harmston}and{Coleby}have changed 
 from agricultural communities to      
 dormitory villages. Public transport  
 no longer runs through the heart of   
 these villages but along the main road
 0.25 mile away. Both Post Offices are 
 unable to compete with supermarkets   
 and are threatened by increased postal
 benefit and pension options. District 
 firms make Â£10_15 call out charges.   
 A mobile bank is available in the     
 district three times a week.          
 Local voluntary organisations and the 
 public give commendable support to the
 Harmston Hall Hospital.               
 Villagers and visitors enjoy the      
 walking facilities of Ermine          
 Street,the Viking Way and the pleasant
 wide grass verges.                    
 In 1979{Coleby}won the county Best    
 Kept Small Village award for the      
 second time.                          </content>
