		<title>19LYDFORD TWINNING</title>
		<content> "Twinning" between the people of Devon
 and Calvados in France is to encourage
 and have links one with the other and 
 reciprocate in exchanges in relation  
 to cultural,economic and social       
 affairs and tourism so as to develop  
 co operation, mutual understanding and
 friendship between them. A village    
 called Petiville was chosen and       
 exploratory visits were made. The     
 official signing of a charter took    
 place at Petiville in October 1978    
 with 20 Lydford people present and at 
 Lydford in July 1979 in the Castle    
 grounds with much celebration.Since   
 that time exchange visits have taken  
 place between families and friends and
 in June 1982 a party of 18 children   
 and their teacher came to Lydford for 
 5 days then a delegation from Lydford 
 went over to Petiville for the opening
 of their new school.                  </content>
