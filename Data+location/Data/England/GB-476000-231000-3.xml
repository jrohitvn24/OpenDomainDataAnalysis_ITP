		<content>  Great Horwood School is a Church of  
England (Controlled) Combined School.  
It caters for children between five and
twelve years of age. The youngest      
children come mainly from the village  
itself or from the hamlet of           
Singleborough. At eight years of age   
children also come from the villages of
Thornborough, Whaddon and Nash.        
                                       
  There are about 173 pupils in the    
school and seven teachers. The school  
was built in 1857, but the old building
is only used as a canteen.In 1960 a new
building with four classrooms was built
and since then two more classrooms have
been added.The school has a small      
swimming pool and a conservation area, 
which includes a pond.
