 Some of the shops are expensive       
 because there isn't much competition.I
 use Stevenson's the butchers.I buy my 
 vegetables at Moody's.They are        
 expensive but they are nice. I buy    
 my bread there too.                   
 I buy the bulk of my shopping at South
 Shields.It is cheaper there.The       
 Liptons in Whitburn is very expensive.
 What do you do in your spare time?    
 Well I'm not very active.I just like  
 to knit or read or go for a walk.     
 Are the people in Whitburn friendly?  
 They are when you belong here.But my  
 husband didn't come here till we got  
 married and he says it takes a while  
 to get used to you but they are       
 alright now.                          
 In what way are they friendly?        
 They seem to be interested in you.I   
 could rely on my neighbours to help me</content>
