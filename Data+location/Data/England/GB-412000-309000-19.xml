		<title>19STOWE POOL LICHFIELD</title>
		<content>   {Stowe Pool},originally part of the 
Bishop's Manorial rights,was later used
as a reservoir and supplied Lichfield  
with some of its water.Now it provides 
opportunities for leisure activities.  
   There is a sailing club that uses   
the pool for most of the year.The boats
are mainly "Mirror" and "Topper"       
dinghies.A small club house at the side
of the pool houses an inflatable rescue
boat.                                  
   Sailboards are also becoming very   
popular.                               
   Fishing,by licence,is permitted in  
certain seasons of the year.Perch,Roach
and Pike are the most common fish.     
   Swimming is not permitted as the    
pool is 17ft deep in the middle.       
   Swans visit the pool but do not nest
there.There are usually some Mallard   
ducks on the pool and an occasional    
Canada goose.                          </content>
