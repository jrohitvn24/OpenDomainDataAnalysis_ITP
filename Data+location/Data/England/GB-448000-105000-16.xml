		<content>  Our area is one of great geographical
 and ecological interest.We are placed 
 on a spur with{Portsmouth Water}to the
 East,{Southampton Water}to the West   
 and{The Solent}separating us from The 
 Isle of Wight. The area is very flat, 
 receiving better than average hours of
 sunshine and a moderate climate.The   
 soil is light and sandy, ideal for the
 growing of vegetables.                
  Although our shores are used for a   
 great many water sports,due to the    
 nearby oil refinery and docks, the    
 water is rather{polluted}and unsafe   
 for swimming.                         
  Geographically the area has undergone
{tremendous change}within the last     
 century.There is little to remind us  
 of the dense forest which once covered
 the area except for the proximity of  
 the{New Forest}ten miles away.
