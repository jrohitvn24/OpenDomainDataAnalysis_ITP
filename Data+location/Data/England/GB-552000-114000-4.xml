		<title>04A Day In The Life of M.Tarry</title>
		<content> Beep! my watch alarm wakes me up at   
 7.15a.m. on a sunny day in East Sussex
 in the summer of 1985. I groan and    
 open my eyes. Mum comes in and gives  
 me a cup of tea to attempt to wake me 
 up.                                   
 I put on my clothes, which on school  
 days is school uniform consisting of a
 white shirt and black trousers and    
 white socks and my tie which is red   
 and blue stripes which I only wear in 
 winter and on school visits.          
 I walk to the mirror and brush my     
 hair. I have got blond hair which is  
 quite short and greyish blue eyes.    
 I go down to breakfast and lay the    
 table. For breakfast I eat Weetabix or
 Cornflakes with milk and sugar and a  
 cup of tea to wash it down with. I    
 have an 8 year old sister called      
 Alexandra or Alex for short.
