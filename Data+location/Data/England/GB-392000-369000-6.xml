		<title>06Macclesfield Canal</title>
		<content> Macclesfield canal was built by Thomas
 Telford and was opened in 1831.The    
 Peak Forest Canal and the Trent and   
 Mersey canal are joined by it.It used 
 to be used to carry goods for industry
 but now it is not used for this to our
 knowledge but is used for cruising in 
 narrow boats and other craft.         
 Fishing competitions are often held on
 its banks.Some people use the old tow 
 path which has recently been          
 resurfaced to walk or to jog along    
 which is a very popular pastime.You   
 are not allowed to ride horses or     
 bicycles on the tow path.The          
 Macclesfield canal is part of the ring
 of Cheshire canals and James Brindley 
 served his apprenticeship locally at  
 Gurnett and a plaque notes this on the
 wall of the house
