		<title>13Local History of The Lee</title>
		<content> Little is known of the{Iron Age}      
 emplacement in Bray's Wood.           
{Middle Ages}A site of 7.5 acres, near 
 Church Farm, is bounded by earthworks.
 It is probably from 13/14th C when The
 Lee was granted to Missenden Abbey.   
 Within the earthworks, the{Old Church,
 which is a Grade 1 listed building, &amp; 
 some glass in the E. window, are 13th 
 century. It was faced with redundancy 
 in 1977,but villagers raised money for
 repairs. The roof, heating &amp; lighting 
 systems are new, &amp; rotten panelling   
 removed. {Mediaeval wall paintings    
 have been uncovered &amp; further work &amp;  
 repairs to the E. window are planned. 
{The Lee Well}The Jubilee well was     
 financed by public subscription in    
 1897 for Q. Victoria's Jubilee. It is 
 365 ft deep, water being raised in    
 conical buckets. It was last used in  
 1952 to water the allotments.         </content>
