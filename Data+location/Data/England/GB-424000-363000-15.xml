		<title>15Education Stanton School</title>
		<content> The plaque beneath the bell tower says
 that the school was built in 1879. It 
 is an old fashioned building with high
 ceilings and stone mullioned windows -
 too high to see through.  There are 43
 five to eleven year old children at   
 our school, from Stanton, Stanton     
 Lees, Pilough, Congreave and          
 Birchover. We begin with assembly. We 
 sing hymns and have prayers. Then we  
 do mathematics and language work. We  
 have science and topic work, singing, 
 art and craft, games, swimming and    
 drama.  At play time we skip, play    
 hopscotch, 'elastics' and football. In
 winter we make snowmen and barracades 
 for war games. From our playground we 
 can see Haddon Hall. We have special  
 Christmas and Harvest Services, a     
 Summer Concert, a Sports Day and inter
 school events. We go on several       
 outings. I like school.               </content>
