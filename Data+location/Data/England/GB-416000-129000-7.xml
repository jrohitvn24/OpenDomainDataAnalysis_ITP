		<title>07The Playgroup in Laverstock.</title>
		<content>  In 1965 the playgroup was run        
 privately in Elm Close, in a house, by
 Miss Higgs. From 1970-78 Mrs. Baggley 
 took over. Now the playgroup is run by
 a committee of mothers. Mrs. Owen is  
 employed as the supervisor. The play  
 group is affiliated to the NPGA and   
 takes children of ages 3-4, with about
 20 pupils per day except Thursdays    
 which is 'Mum and Todlers morning'.   
 The aim is to teach the children      
 manners and to get them used to being 
 without their mums for a few hours.   
 They are also taught basic reading and
 writing. Birthdays are special        
 occasions for the pupils when they    
 have a party. Every week includes     
 something different making use of     
 usual art/craft activities. Help is   
 given by pupils from the local Girls  
 Secondary School. There is a close    
 link with the local Primary School.   </content>
