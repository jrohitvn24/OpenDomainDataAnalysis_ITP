  The major tourist attraction in this 
 area is the 'North of England Open Air
 Museum' at Beamish.The museum is      
 administered by four County           
 Councils:Cleveland,Northumberland,Tyne
 and Wear and Durham.The museum        
 site,once part of the Beamish Hall    
 Estate,covers about two hundred acres 
 of woodland and countryside.Old       
 buildings from all parts of the region
 are being dismantled and then rebuilt 
 and equipped at Beamish with period   
 furniture and machinery.These         
 buildings are grouped together to     
 create communities as they used to be 
 in the early 1900's.The museum is     
 divided into areas joined by footpaths
 and tramways.
