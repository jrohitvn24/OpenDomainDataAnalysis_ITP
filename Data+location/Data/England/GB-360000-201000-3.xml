		<content>    The days when the area traded via  
 the river have passed,few trains stop,
 but the A48 trunk road gives quick    
 access to both England and Wales.Ten  
 miles away and visible throughout the 
 area lies the mighty Severn Bridge and
 M4.From there it is easy to quickly   
 reach London,the South West or South  
 Wales.Travelling North via Gloucester 
 we connect easily with the M5/M6.     
    Before the Severn Bridge much of   
 the traffic to and from Wales trundled
 through Lydney.People wonder what     
 effect a bridge closure would have in 
 today's traffic.A traffic survey we   
 carried out in May showed an average  
 load of 330 vehicles per hour.What    
 might it be without the bridge?       
    The local council have long been   
 pressing for a by-pass but no starting
 date has yet been announced or a      
 definite route agreed.                </content>
