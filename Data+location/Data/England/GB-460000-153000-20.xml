		<title>20My Typical Weekend</title>
		<content> On Saturday I get up at about 7.30am  
 and have my breakfast and then I get  
 washed and dressed. I pack my bag for 
 gym. It takes twenty minutes to get to
 my gymnastics class.  I get home about
 2.30pm and have my lunch.  Then I get 
 changed and watch television. I       
 sometimes go out and play in the back 
 garden. We have tea at 7.30pm and I go
 to bed about 10.30pm having watched   
 some more television. On Sunday I     
 usually get up at 9.00am.  I get      
 washed and dressed and have my        
 breakfast.  I will play with my       
 brother or watch television if there  
 is anything on.  We have a traditional
 Sunday dinner at 1.00pm.  I play till 
 teatime.  After tea I have a bath and 
 wash my hair and, having watched      
 television, go to bed.
