		<title>09CHANGING TIMES IN DUNSTABLE</title>
		<content> Since 1905 the population of Dunstable
 has increased five fold.In 1935 the   
 main for of transport were bicycles.At
 this time,the majority of council     
 houses were to be found on one        
 estate,and there were a few small     
 shops.A.C. Delco was built in the     
 1930's and the expansion of Dunstable 
 began,though the greatest changes     
 started after the 2nd World War.In    
 1960 there were more pubs than in 1930
 because one each new estate that was  
 built,a new pub was built in 1964.This
 was followed,in the early 80's by a   
 smaller one called Ashton Square.In   
 1964 Church St was widened to allow   
 more traffic,and recently the traffic 
 lights at the major crossroads were   
 replaced by a complex roundabout.
