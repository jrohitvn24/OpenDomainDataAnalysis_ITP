		<title>12A Day in the Life of Neil</title>
		<content>  I wake up at 7 o'clock, get dressed  
 and go downstairs. I read a comic     
 while I wait for my breakfast of      
 porridge, after which I listen to some
 Breakdance music.                     
  Next, I collect my bag and go down to
 the bus stop to wait for the school   
 bus. When I get to school I wait in   
 the playground for about 5 minutes.   
  We go inside at 8.55 and line up for 
 Assembly. After Assembly we have      
 lessons. My favourite lessons are     
 English, Art and Curve Stitching.     
  After school I play with my friends  
 at the park. I often go fishing.I go  
 in for my tea at about 8.30.I go to   
 bed at 9.30 or 10.00.                 
  That is how I spend a normal school  
 day.
