		<content> Farmhouses are scattered across this  
 area and are the predominant type of  
 housing.  Some are newer houses but   
 most are stone build and many years   
 old.  There are two short terraces    
 both thought to have been built to    
 house farm workers.  There has been   
 little new building in the area since 
 then.  On the road to Chilcompton     
 there is a former Toll House erected  
 by the Wells Turnpike Trust, which was
 moved to its present position i 1835  
 to include the traffic of coal which  
 would hae otherwise avoided the toll. 
 The population of the area is quite   
 static and houses only come up for    
 sale infrequently and as there is     
 little new building many young people 
 are forced to move away to find       
 accomodation.
