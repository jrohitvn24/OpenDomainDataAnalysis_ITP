		<content>   One old lady we visted had strong   
 views about today's life, such as :   
 children have too much pocket money,  
 Â£1 doesn't mean anything now.She's    
 also disgusted at the way some        
 teachers dress and also she doesn't   
 think there's any religion these days.
   A lady who works at the post office 
 in Purleigh doesn't like the new block
 of houses which stands behind the     
 shop.Also another lady was ashamed of 
 the council houses.                   
   One person wished there was still a 
 chapel which was knocked down ten     
 years ago.                            
   Many people commented that one of   
 the main improvements that could be   
 made would be to install main drainage
 as there are several houses without   
 this basic facility.                  
                                       
                                       </content>
