		<content>      The central part of the village  
 is quite old with evidence that it was
 a village in the original Domesday    
 Book of 1086. Until the middle of this
 century it must have remained a fairly
 small village,with other small        
 settlements around it such as:_       
   Bovingdon on Green    Pudds Cross   
   Shantock Hall         Venus Hill    
   Hogpits Bottom        Bulstrode     
                                       
                                       
                                       
      One new housing estate was built 
 in the 1930s and two further estates  
 in the last ten years. Many of the    
 people who live here travel outside   
 the village for work.                 
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
