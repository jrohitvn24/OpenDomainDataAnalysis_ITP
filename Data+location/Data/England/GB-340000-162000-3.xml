 In 1085 the Manor of Congresbury was  
 held directly by the King. In 1066 it 
 had been held by Earl Harold. It paid 
 tax for 20 hides (about 2400 acres)   
 and was worth 60 shillings. It seems  
 that the area was always used for     
 pasture since it had 250 acres of     
 meadow and pasture 2 leagues long (3  
 miles) and a half a league (1.5 miles)
 wide. This supported 2 cobs, 20       
 cattle, 40 pigs, 200 sheep and 40     
 goats. Today there is much more cattle
 raising than sheep rearing.           
                                       
 The Domesday Book tells us that the   
 manor paid Â£28 15s in white silver.   
 This is lead and although there are   
 remains of lead mines on the nearby   
 Mendips, there are none near          
 Congresbury.                          </content>
