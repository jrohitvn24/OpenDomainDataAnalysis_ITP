		<title>19World War 2's Effect on Rye</title>
		<content>  During the War Rye was quite a big   
 target for the Germans because it was 
 just across the coast. Many people    
 were evacuated until the end of the   
 war. The cinema was bombed but it was 
 built again after the war and it was  
 the first cinema newly built in       
 England. The nearest doodlebug to fall
 was at Cadborough Cliff. When Rye was 
 evacuated the Grammar School was moved
 to Bedford. Forty years ago there was 
 only one pottery in Rye and now there 
 are many. The Post Office was in the  
 High Street. The estate opposite Fread
 Gardham School was built in 1936. Also
 after the war there many jobs for     
 rebuilding places and in farming.
