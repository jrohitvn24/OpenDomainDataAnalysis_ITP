		<title>07COBERLEY SCHOOL: PUPIL</title>
		<content> Coberley is a mixed school. The pupils
 of Coberley like their school. Most   
 people get on with each other and     
 there is a happy atmosphere. The      
 subjects the pupils miss learning are 
 languages. They work in two classes,  
 junior and infant.                    
   They enjoy sport. They play shinty, 
 football, rounders and netball. For   
 three subjects, sport, drama and music
 they join up with ten other schools.  
 They are very sporty and play rounders
 most playtimes.                       
   In lessons they work from different 
 work books. There is no set timetable 
 and they do what the teacher decides. 
 The older pupils sometimes help the   
 younger ones. The pupils don't mind   
 playing against older children and    
 they don't mind losing.
