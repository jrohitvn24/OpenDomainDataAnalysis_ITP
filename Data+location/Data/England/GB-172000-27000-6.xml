		<content> The first original school was held at 
 the Parish Vestry from May 1785.The   
 children who went had to pay one half 
  penny a day.Then at Ponjeravah there 
 was a boys school,endowed by the Fox  
 Family opened in 1836.At the church a 
  hall was built. There a girls and    
 infants school was formed and this    
 school was separate from the          
 boys.Meals were served at the         
 Recreational club .Then new plans were
 drawn upfor a County Primary          
 Schoolwhich was officially openedin   
 1966.The old schools thus were        
 amalganated into a new school,opened  
 by the Prime Minister H.Wilson.The new
 school stood in its own grounds at the
 top end of the village.It had five    
 classrooms, a large halland its own   
 canteen for meals.Later it had its own
 changing roomsand a heated swimming   
 pool,with a flourishing P.T.A.        </content>
