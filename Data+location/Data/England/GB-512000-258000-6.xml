		<title>06Podington Airfield</title>
		<content> Podington airfield was a wartime air  
 base that was last used by the        
 Ministry of Defence in 1958. Following
 it's derequisition a few of it's      
 buildings and concrete aprons were    
 removed. Other buildings were retained
 and used by the Ministry of Supply    
 until about 1968, then some of the    
 land reverted to it's original        
 agricultural use. A Drag Racing Strip 
 was permitted in 1969. The airfield   
 has always posed a problem for the    
 planning authorities. Many of the     
 buildings are in a bad state of       
 repair. Some of the buildings have    
 established use rights for storage and
 some are occupied by unauthorised     
 industrial users, on who it has been  
 difficult to enforce planning controls
 with any degree of success. It has    
 always been the policy , to return the
 land to agriculture.                  </content>
