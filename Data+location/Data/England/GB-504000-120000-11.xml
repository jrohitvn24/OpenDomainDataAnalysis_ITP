		<title>11CODMORE HILL GARDEN CENTRE</title>
		<content>  On the western side of the A29,a     
 former nursery is being converted into
 a garden centre to be called          
 "Nightingales".                       
  Plants for sale will be displayed on 
 islands and watered by a piped        
 irrigation system automatically       
 programmed to come into operation when
 the centre is closed to the public.   
  A former greenhouse is being         
 converted into a shop and restaurant, 
 with an aquarium in one corner.       
  The new owners, whose main centre is 
 at Horsham,intend to take over the    
 full 12 acres of nursery and restore  
 the derelict or run down greenhouses. 
 They will propagate and grow for sale,
 plants which are now regarded as      
 unusual. The business will provide    
 employment for about 15 full time     
 staff and some part time helpers.
