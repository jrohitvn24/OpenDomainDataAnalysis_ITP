		<content> A recent survey of the population     
 showed that on the whole most people  
 were quite happy to live in this area.
 However,they had a few complaints as  
 follows:-                             
 a)that not enough was being done to   
 improve recreational facilities.      
 b)that the bus service was very       
 inadequate for the needs of old people
 and teenagers.                        
 c)that the postal service is very     
 poor.                                 
 d)that while the school provided a    
 high standard of education the recent 
 cuts in spending had adversely        
 affected our school facilities and    
 staffing.                             
 e)that the flow of traffic in the     
 village was too intense for such a    
 narrow road.                          
 MOST PEOPLE SAID THAT, GIVEN THE      
 CHOICE,THEY WOULD NOT LIVE ELSEWHERE. </content>
