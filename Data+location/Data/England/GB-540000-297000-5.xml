		<content>  The{March/Chatteris Bypass}was opened
 in 1984,and was built to avoid having 
 heavy traffic going through the town. 
 The bypass is{West of March,          
 travelling through an attractive      
 Fenland route.                        
{ Mini factories}in the N.E.still have 
 to send their traffic by the town     
 centre route if travelling South.     
  The{Rainbow Superstore}will open in  
{September 1985,}and is to open{6 days 
{a week,}with{late-night shopping}from 
{Wednesday}to{Friday.}The store is near

 encourage people to shop in{March,    
 rather than{Wisbech}and{Peterborough.
