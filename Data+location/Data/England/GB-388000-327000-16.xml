   Until relatively recently,this area 
 had only one main road running from   
 north to south,the A34,which passes   
 through the eastern side of our       
 zone.But with the vast increases in   
 numbers of vehicles and in their      
 size,the building of the M6 Motorway  
 became necessary.This runs parallel   
 to the A34 though is on the western   
 side of the area.Apart from this,there
 is only one other main road,though    
 there are a considerable number of    
 lanes joining these roads to the      
 villages and farms.                   
   We made two surveys of the traffic  
 on the M6,one on a fine Saturday,the  
 other on a wet Thursday.Both were in  
 the late morning and each was for a   
 quarter of an hour in each            
 direction.The totals show considerable
 variation and can partly be accounted </content>
