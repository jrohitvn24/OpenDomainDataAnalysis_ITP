		<content>      At the petrol pumps they sell    
 2000 gallons a week. This fuel is     
 stored in tanks undergroud and pumped 
 up by electric pumps.The garage has   
 been open since 1976 and they sell an 
 average of 100 cars a year. There are 
 8-10 used cars on show and the most   
 popular makes are Ford, Vauxall and   
 Talbot. We were shown the Four Post   
 Lift which takes the cars up high     
 enough for the mechanics to work      
 underneath in safety. They have       
 oxy-acetylene welding equipment and a 
 dust free room for spray painting     
 cars. In the spares store they keep   
 all the small components to service   
 cars and keep them in good repair.The 
 garage is open from 08.00hrs to       
 19.00hrs.
