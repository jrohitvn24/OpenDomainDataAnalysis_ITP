		<content> Chew Magna Playgroup, affiliated to   
 the Pre-School Playgroup Association  
 and registered by Avon County Council 
 for up to 24 children, meets on the   
 ground floor of the Old Schoolroom on 
 Monday, Thursday and Friday mornings  
 during school term time. At present,  
 18 children, aged between 3 and 5     
 years, attend. The object of playgroup
 is to help them gain confidence and to
 learn to mix socially and share with  
 others. The two supervisors and two   
 helpers, who all live in Chew Magna,  
 hope to stimulate coordination through
 activities such as painting, cutting, 
 sticking, jigsaws and building with   
 blocks. The concept is to "learn      
 through play" and time spent with dry 
 and wet sand, water and playdough is  
 very important, as is the home corner.
 The children soon settle in and enjoy 
 every session.                        </content>
