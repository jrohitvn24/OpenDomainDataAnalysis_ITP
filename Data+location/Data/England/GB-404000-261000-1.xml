		<title>01GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF AREA</title>
		<content> The area is built near an old salt    
 way.This came from Droitwich, it was  
 taken to Fosse Way and was then       
 distributed out around the Midlands.  
 There is a park which has older       
 children riding on motorbikes up and  
 down the slide.There are 2 schools    
 in Astwood Bank,a primary school and a
 middle school.The primary school  is  
 about 104 years old.The middle school 
 was built in 1958 and was officially  
 opened on the 15th  January 1959.     
 Sambourne was a village with many     
 hunters,they used to hunt in the Arden
 forest.There is a public house called 
 'The Green Dragon.'This pub was used  
 often on the days of hunts.There      
 aren't many houses,but there is a     
 monks bath and a trout farm.There is  
 also an old derelict house which was  
 once a school.
