		<title>13The Church in North Leigh</title>

Saint Mary's church was in my block. We
spent about ten minutes in the church. 
In memory of people who had belonged to
the parish, there were cushions, on    
which their names were embroidered.The 
Saxons built the church in 1040. The   
Normans later added another part. The  
church has wooden benches. It is       
situated  on the outskirts of North    
Leigh and it belongs to the Church of  
England. There were lots of flowers in 
the church on the day we visited,      
because there had been a flower        
festival the weekend before.
