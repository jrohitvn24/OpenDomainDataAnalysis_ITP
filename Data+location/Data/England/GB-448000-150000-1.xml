		<content>{Introduction - Overton                
 This block is mainly arable land; only
 one quarter is developed. It is       
 traversed by the main London - west of
 England railway line abut the station 
 at Overton in the north-east corner of
 the block is no longer manned although
 trains do stop there frequently. The  
 developed area is all in the southern 
 end of the block and comprises two    
 housing estates both less than 10     
 years old, the Church, the School, a  
 cluster of farm buildings and some    
 farm workers' cottages. The River Test
 forms a natural boundary to the block 
 on the south-west corner. In the      
 north-east of the block lies Portals  
 Mill the only large industrial site in
 the village and a major employer.
