		<title>19Union Chain Bridge</title>
		<content>   The bridge became the prototype for 
 suspension bidges throughout the      
 world.                                
   The span between the towers is      
 437ft. with the actual bridge being   
 only 316ft. as the English Tower is   
 set back into the cliff to allow the  
 road to curve onto the bridge.The     
 Scottish Tower is 60ft. high and has a
 road arch 10ft. wide and 17ft.        
 high.The anchorages of the suspension 
 chains are embedded into the earth on 
 the Scottish side and into into the   
 rock high up on the English side.Rods 
 hang alternately from each tier of    
 chains so that the weight of the road 
 platform can be borne equally by all  
 chains.The road platform is built 27ft
 above the normal summer level of the  
 River Tweed;at the time of building   
 this was 10ft. above the highest flood
 level,but in 1948 it was only inches. </content>
