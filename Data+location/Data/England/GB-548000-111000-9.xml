		<title>09A FAMILY DAY OUT</title>
		<content> One Saturday morning my alarm went off
 at 7.30. I got dressed; I had to put  
 on warm clothes because we were going 
 sailing at Cuckmere. After breakfast  
 we drove to Newhaven Marina in our    
 B-registered Metro. We were going     
 sailing with some friends. We took two
 boats, one called the Enys Tan, and   
 the other Blue Zeta. They are both 28 
 feet long, with ovens, sleeping       
 quarters and engines; both have a jib 
 and a mainsail.                       
 We anchored our boats in 20ft. of     
 water and had a picnic lunch. Later we
 did some swimming and fished in rock  
 pools. My Mum and sister, with some of
 our friends, went to a nature trail.  
 The rest of us sailed around the coast
 and picked them up at the end of the  
 trail on the way home.                
 It was a lovely day out.
