		<content> Ferham House is the local health      
 centre for several districts in       
 Rotherham including Ferham,           
 Masborough, Holmes, Kimberworth, and  
 Catcliffe.  There are a lot of people 
 based at the health centre including  
 five school nurses, seven health      
 visitors, twenty district nurses and  
 fifteen doctors. A typical day for the
 school nurse would would involve      
 visits to perhaps three schools to    
 check on sight, weight hearing and    
 height then several visits to         
 children's houses to check on         
 individual medical needs and finally  
 working at one of the clinics that are
 held in Ferham House. The clinics that
 are heald daily there include speech  
 therapy, hearing, eyes, dental,       
 chiropidist and baby clinics.
