		<content>The main surgery is in Lamberhurst Road
and has two doctors, Dr. Ironmonger and
Dr. Anderson.  This surgery is only    
three years old and it was previously a
private house.  It is open from 8.30 to
9.00 a.m. from Monday to Friday.  The  
doctors see patients by appointment    
from ll.00 to l2.30 p.m. on Mondays,   
Wednesdays and Thursdays.  Mrs.        
Fairhurst is the nurse attached to the 
surgery: Mrs. Guest and Mrs. Armitage  
are the receptionists.  The doctor from
Lamberhurst, Dr. Johnson, holds a      
surgery twice a week in a house in     
Maidstone Road. Some people prefer the 
Goudhurst doctor, Dr. Hugo.            
As there is no dentist in Horsmonden,  
most people go to Tunbridge Wells,     
Cranbrook or Paddock Wood.             
There is a chiropodist called Mrs.     
Manley who comes every six weeks to the
Village Hall.                          </content>
