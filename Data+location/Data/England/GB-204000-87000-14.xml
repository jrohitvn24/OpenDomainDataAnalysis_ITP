		<content> Local octogenarian,{Mr.Frank Nute}    
 ,remembers Tintagel as it was in his  
 childhood.The present school was      
 opened,just before the 1st World War, 
 when Mr.Nute was a school boy.        
 Previously the school was in the Old  
 Schoolroom in the village.The first   
 headmaster of the present school was a
 bearded man called Mr.White.Each day  
 mothers would come at 11.45 am,bang on
 the window andthe boys would be let   
 out of school to run to the quarry on 
 the cliff with their fathers' lunches 
 - a pasty and a jar of tea.There was  
 also a copper and silver mine at      
 Castle Cove at this time.Mr.Nute's    
 first job was as a carpenters         
 apprentice in Treknow.Although        
 Tintagel has changed greatly in his   
 lifetime,the old local families of the
 Chillcotts and Dangars still live in  
 the village.                          </content>
