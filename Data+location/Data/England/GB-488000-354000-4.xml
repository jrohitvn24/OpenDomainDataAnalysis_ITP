		<content> Several tig games are played. When    
 people are tug they have to stand     
 still until a person who is free tigs 
 them.For Stuck in The Mud people who  
 are caught stand with their legs apart
 and arms outstretched.People being    
 chased are safe if they are under the 
 caught person's arms or legs. They    
 free the caught person when they pass 
 right through or under.Other versions 
 are Tiggy off ground and off tarmac.  
   Cinderella is a skipping game. Two  
 people turn the rope and one person   
 jumps over the rope in the middle.They
 all then sing this rhyme:{"Cinderella 
{dressed in red, went upstairs to go to
{bed,kissed the snake, instead of Jake,
{how many doctors did it take?"}The    
 rope holders then turn the rope       
 quickly and count until the person in 
 the middle stops the rope.A variation 
 of this game is called Bumper Car.    </content>
