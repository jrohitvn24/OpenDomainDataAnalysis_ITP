		<title>05LOCAL FOOTPATHS</title>
		<content>  We carried out a survey of the       
 footpaths in our villages to see if   
 they were all clear for the walkers.We
 used an Ordnance Survey map to see    
 where the footpaths should be and then
 went out to find them.The path along  
 the bank of the River Arun was really 
 good with nice short grass to walk    
 on.We watched the swans floating on   
 the tide and saw a heron at the water 
 side.We went all the way to the       
 railway bridge.By the marina we looked
 for signs of the old canal but        
 couldn't see much except the          
 lock-keeper's cottage.The tow-path is 
 still marked by a footpath and you can
 walk all the way to Chichester.We     
 couldn't find the path from the river 
 to the Caravan Park because the farmer
 had sown the field with wheat but     
 there there was a signpost to show    
 where the path should be.             </content>
