		<title>19A Day in the life of:</title>
		<content>Mrs Lynn James gets up around 7.30am   
and makes breakfast.Then her husband   
and children come down,they have       
cereals and toast.Every Tuesday and    
Thursday morning,she takes Lee(her son)
to play group,but on other mornings she
does general house-work.At 11.00am she 
has a cup of coffee and Lee has a drink
of pop,but if Lee is at playgroup Lynn,
has to leave at 11.00am to pick him up.
Then by that time it's lunch.Adele(her 
daughter)goes back to school around    
1.00pm.Then in the afternoon,if she has
some ironing to do she'll do that,or   
take Lee to the park.She sometimes     
watches the television in the          
afternoon.They have a snack for tea,   
then Adele and Lee are sent up to bed. 
A couple of hours later Lynn and her   
husband go to bed.
