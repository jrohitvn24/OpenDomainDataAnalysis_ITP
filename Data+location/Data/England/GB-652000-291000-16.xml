		<title>16THE DOCKS AT LOWESTOFT</title>
		<content>                                       
    The fish-docks in Lowestoft are not
as busy as they were. We used to have  
many trawlers, but now we only have 19 
as the fishing industry has declined.  
Many of the old trawlers have been     
converted to oil or gas-rig rescue or  
stand-by ships.                        
    We have a bascule bridge where the 
A12 road separates the Outer Harbour   
from the Inner Harbour. In the Inner   
Harbour ships are built, repaired,     
cargoes unloaded and goods stored. By  
the Outer Harbour there is a yacht     
club and the Fish Market.              
    The port now has a container trade 
as we had two million pounds spent on  
it last year. We now get timber from   
northern countries besides many other  
imports.
