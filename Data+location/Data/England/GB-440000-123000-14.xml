		<title>14ST. MARKS CHURCH, AMPFIELD</title>
		<content>    St. Marks Church is in Ampfield,   
 and it backs onto Ampfield Woods.John 
 Keeble was the {architect }and he     
 thought it would be a good idea to    
 have a church in 1841 for the village 
 people of Knapp.(Ampfield had not yet 
 been developed). The land was given   
 opposite a farm which is now Hilliers 
 500 yards from Knapp.                 
    The{Church}itself is quite small   
 although it can hold 150 people. It is
 built of chalk and it has a great     
 wooden door. There are lots of rows of
 pews and the{vicar}sometimes has a    
 choir, which stands at the altar end  
 of the church. At either end of the   
 church there are large beautiful      
 stained glass windows . Standing on   
 the lectern there is a huge bible.
