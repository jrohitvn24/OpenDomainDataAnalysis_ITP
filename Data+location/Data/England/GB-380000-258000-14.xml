		<title>14HISTORIC HOUSES IN GRIMLEY</title>
		<content>    Thorngrove was built in the late   
 18th century. It has a bathstone front
 with stone framed windows and one     
 front door. The present owners Mr.&amp;   
 Mrs G.Hickton bought Thorngrove in    
 1981. The stables have been converted 
 into cottages.                        
    Notable occupants include Lucien   
 Bonaparte, younger brother of Napole- 
 an, who came to the house in 1811 as a
 prisoner of war. Sir Samuel Baker liv-
 ed at Thorngrove. He discovered Lake  
 Albert Nyanza a source of the River   
 Nile.He died in 1893 and his ashes in-
 terned in the family tomb at Grimley. 
    The Dallows, formerly Ivy House, is
 a part brick and part timber-framed   
 house. The rear is probably late Eliz-
 abethan and the brick front circa     
 1700. It was a farmhouse. Twenty years
 ago the ivy was taken off and a Georg-
 ian front doorway inserted.           </content>
