		<content> In 1914  a serious fire gutted the    
interior of All Saints Church the oak  
benches which were provided in 1888    
were destroyed and were replaced with  
                                       
                                       
                                       
individual seating. The stained glass  
windows were completely lost. Only one 
of the bells now remains.              
                                       
 The Chapel which is in North Street   
next door to Thatchers Hall was built  
in 1846 on land given by a Mr. Potter  
who lived at the "Thatchers" to the    
United Reformed Church. The Church is  
a member of a circuit with no resident 
Minister.
