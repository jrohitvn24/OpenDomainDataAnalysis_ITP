		<content> There are two small areas of housing  
in this survey area. On the east side  
of the A.34 is an area of recently     
built houses. Most of the houses are   
open plan. They are well maintained and
owner occupied. There are two estates  
and they are named after trees, Cedar  
and Redwood. This 1970's building      
overlooks the pasture land that borders
the River Trent.                       
 A footbridge leads across the A.34 to 
the interwar and 1960's housing of the 
Walton Estate.                         
 Two areas of recreation are to be     
found in the vicinity of the footbridge
There is a Council maintained football 
field which also has a childrens play  
area. By the side of this field is an  
area of allotments.
