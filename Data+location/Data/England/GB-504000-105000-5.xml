		<content> THE PRECEPTORY OF POLING              
                                       
 Taken over in the war of the roses,   
 the estate was given to the Earl of   
 Arundel in 1418, and the knights were 
 thrown out.  Sir Harry Johnson took   
 over the house while he ruled         
 Uganda.                               
 The house has got three sections.  The
 end section was a chapel with a large 
 east window which is now bricked up.  
 Outside the chapel was a large burial 
 ground in which a grave slab, which is
 now positioned on the dining room     
 wall, was found.                      
 Before the war there were four        
 separate farms but now there is only  
 one in the original six and a half    
 acres of land.  In the garden there is
 a well which used to be the main water
 supply for the preceptory.
