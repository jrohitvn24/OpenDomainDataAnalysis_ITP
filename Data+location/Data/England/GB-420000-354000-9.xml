 The Church has 6 bells, three of which
 date to 1677-1763 two were added in   
 1911 and one in 1913.                 
 The registers go back to 1716.        
 The Village Mermorial to those who    
 fell in the World Wars is at the West 
 end of the church, 15 names on one    
 tablet (1914-18) one name on the      
 second (1939-45).                     
 In the churchyard some of the grave   
 stones have notable verses carved on  
 them, warning us that death happeneth 
 to all of us.  Incorporated in the    
 main steps to the porch is probably   
 the oldest gravestone dated 1695.     
 The church numbers some 20 attenders  
 at Sunday services but for special    
 services the congregation fills the   
 church.
