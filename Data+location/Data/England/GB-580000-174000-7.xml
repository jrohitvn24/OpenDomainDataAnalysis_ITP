		<content>{The Methodist Church}in Stoke is very 
 active. Although the membership is    
 only 25, there are on average 50 _ 60 
 people worshipping eah Sunday, from   
 the very young to over 80 yrs.        
 Services take place in the small hall,
 refurbished as a chapel two years ago.
 The large hall, the former chapel, is 
 now used for Sunday School clsses and 
 some of the mid_week activities.  The 
 New International Version of the Bible
 is used and hymns are taken from the  
 Methodist Hymn Book but increasingly  
 songs from "Songs of Fellowship" are  
 being used.   Weekday activities      
 include a fellowship and prayer       
 meeting, youth fellowship, guitar,    
 youth and junior youth clubs.         
 The Methodist Chapel houses a lively  
 growing Christian Fellowship.
