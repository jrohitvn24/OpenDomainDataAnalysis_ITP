		<title>08Hall Lane-Road that changed</title>
		<content>Hall Lane (B5240) used to be a country 
road joining the villages of Burscough 
&amp; Skelmersdale. Now Skelmersdale is a  
new town and the M6 and M58 have been  
built nearby. Hall Lane runs past our  
school &amp; many people think it is       
dangerous. Huge lorries travel along it
-some go over the 60m.p.h. speed limit.
We tested speed of traffic and some did
100m. in less than 4 secs. A lot of    
container lorries go south to          
Skelmersdale from haulage copmpanies in
Burscough. They take empty cans to be  
filled with Coke. They spit up the     
stones and make a wind as they go past.
It is difficult to walk or cycle safely
on Hall Lane. The policeman says it is 
not a dangerous road because there were
only 6 accidents in a year. He says a  
new bypass road will soon be built. Our
Infant Teacher says "They have been    
saying that for 25 years!"             </content>
