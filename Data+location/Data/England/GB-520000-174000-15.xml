		<title>15       NINE-YEAR OLDS' PLAY</title>
		<content>  When I play out I play football with 
 my friends over in the park. Sometimes
 we play on roller skates. We play     
 rollerball, it is great fun. We also  
 play cricket, I always lose in        
 cricket. Sometimes I go and play on   
 jymy bike. We used to play a game     
 which is just the same as run-outs,   
 except you draw arrows on the ground  
 with chalk. Nobody likes us playing   
 that now because it makes too much    
 mess, we have to clear it all up.     
                                       
  I like playing war with my friends. I
 like jumping in puddles and slipping  
 in mud and running through the bushes.
                                       
  We play French skipping, jumping over
 a piece of elastic. I like playing    
 tennis and sometimes I practise with  
 my friends.
