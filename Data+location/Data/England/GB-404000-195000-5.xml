		<content>  South Cerney Water Park is an area of
 22 square miles designated for leisure
 and recreation. The lakes are used    
 mainly for wind- surfing, fishing and 
 jet- skiing. In the Park there is an  
 Information Bureau, toilets and other 
 visitor facilities.                   
  The Cotswold Caravan Park has        
 caravans with showers and flush       
 toilets, and tents can be pitched at  
 Â£17.50 per week. There is a central   
 dining room, which also has a bar. At 
 night there are discos for children.  
  One of the old gravel pits inside the
 Water Park has been set aside as a    
 bird sanctuary and is of considerable 
 interest to visiting ornithologists.  
  The Glos. County Council owns one of 
 the pits, which is used to teach      
 children sailing, canoeing and wind-  
 surfing.
