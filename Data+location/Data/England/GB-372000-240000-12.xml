		<title>12Cubs and Scouts in Colwall</title>
		<content>  The{1st Colwall Scout Group}meets in 
 a building situated behind the Church 
 Rooms, originally built during World  
 War II for cooking meals served there 
 and taken to farms for workers. Later 
 the County Council cooked meals which 
 were taken to 1 Grammar, 2 Infant and 
 2 Junior Schools. In 1982 the Scouts  
 purchased the building and converted  
 it to their Headquarters in 75 days to
 celebrate 75 years of Scouting.       
  Boys from all types of homes are     
 members: 14 cubs (8-11) meet on       
 Mondays; 15 Scouts (11-16) and 8      
 Ventures (16+) meet on Fridays. There 
 are 8 adult leaders. Activities are   
 designed to stretch boys mentally and 
 physically. Wherever possible         
 activities are connected with outdoor 
 pursuits (i.e. Camping). In 1985 the  
 Scouts are camping in Holland -       
 carrying everything on their bicycles.</content>
