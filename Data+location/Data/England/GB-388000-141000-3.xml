		<title>03SUTTON VENY VILLAGE SCHOOL</title>
		<content>   The village school has four classes 
 with four teachers including the head 
 teacher.The age ranges from five to   
 eleven and there are about 94 children
 in the school.Half of them come in by 
 bus from other villages.We are loosing
 one of our teachers because of govern-
 ment savings on schools.              
   Playtime is the best time of the day
 because when it is quite dry we are   
 allowed on the big field which is     
 a part of our school.We have an adven-
 ture playground but we are not allowed
 on it in school time.P.E.is also a    
 good time of the day and we sometimes 
 do country dancing.                   
   We have assembly on every day       
 except Monday and use the church next 
 to our school at the end of term and  
 at Christmas time.
