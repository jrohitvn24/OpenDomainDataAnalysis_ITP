		<content>     The{railway}has always been an    
 important link between South Woodham  
 Ferrers and London. The line, which   
 was originally opened in 1889, has    
 seen a 'hey' day and been threatened  
 with closure.                         
    The yachtsmen visiting Burnham and 
 the many commuters using the line has 
 prompted today's present development. 
    The whole line will be fully       
 automated by May '86. There will be   
 automatic crossing gates and a new    
 modern system of track-circuit signals
    Raising the bridges is the hardest 
 work, but completion will mean 15-20  
 minuits off travelling time. Parents  
 are concerned for the safety of their 
 children using the new crossings, but 
 when they understand how they work    
 their fears will be allieviated.
