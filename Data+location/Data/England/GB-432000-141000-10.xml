		<title>10Eastover Farm.</title>
		<content>     Eastover Farm is rented from Lady 
 Boughey by the John Read Partnership. 
 1600 acres are used for growing crops,
 210 acres for animals and 5 acres for 
 buildings and machinery. They employ  
 seven men on the farm.                
     In 1985 they are growing 1200     
 tonnes of Wheat, 1000 tonnes of       
 Barley, 100 tonnes of rape, 77 tonnes 
 of peas and 68 tonnes of beans. They  
 are harvested between July and        
 September. They are dried and cleaned 
 before transferring to lorries. They  
 are then sent to other E.E.C.         
 countries.                            
     The farm has both beef and dairy  
 cattle. A local dealer takes the beef 
 cattle. The dairy cattle, mainly of   
 Friesian stock, are milked twice a day
 by machine. Twenty five cows are      
 slaughtered each year. During the     
 winter they are kept in sheds.        </content>
