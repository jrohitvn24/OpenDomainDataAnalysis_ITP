		<title>10ROYAL SHREWSBURY HOSPITAL.</title>
		<content>     The Royal Shrewsbury Hospital was 
 built in{1977}and has many different  
 wards depending on the illness e.g.   
{Paediatric, Geriatric, Orthopeadic.}In
 an emergency they can evacuate some   
 people who can be sent home to make   
 room for more serious cases.          
     Most nurses enjoy their work. One 
 or two nurses might give up under     
{stress}but that's usually when they   
 are student nurses and not fully      
{qualified.                            
     It costs 57 million pounds a year 
 to run the Health Service in          
{Shropshire.}The ambulances do         
 1,290,518 miles a year.               
     We interviewed a nurse who worked 
 in the{Maternity}wards. She doesn't   
 spend as much time as she'd like with 
 the mums and babies. They always need 
 new equipment, especially{CTG monitors
 which monitor the babies' heartbeat.  </content>
