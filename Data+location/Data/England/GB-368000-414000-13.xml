		<title>13HEALTH FACILITIES, EGERTON</title>
		<content>    There are no medical facilities in 
 the village, but most residents do not
 consider this inconvenient as the     
 nearby Dunscar Health Centre, has good
 medical facilities for 4 doctors, a   
 chemist and health visitors.          
    Hospital facilities in Bolton meet 
 accident and serious requirements.    
    Dental facilities are available in 
 Bromley Cross, a mile away, and most  
 residents have regular treatment.     
    Most residents are relatively      
 healthy, and consider the facilities  
 adequate.                             
    Children are regularly examined by 
 the School medical services which     
 provides additional facilities as     
 required.                             
    Regular blood donor sessions are   
 held at Walmsley Community Centre.
