		<content> Very few people live in this area as  
 it is covered by either forest or     
 cultivated arable land.  There are    
 only six households in the area,      
 mainly situated on the edge of the    
 forest, and one holiday home.         
 Employment is mainly concerned with   
 agriculture. In addition a gamekeeper,
 employed by a local shooting          
 syndicate, lives and works in the     
 forest protecting and rearing         
 pheasants.  Also on the fringe of     
 the area a quantity surveyor runs his 
 business from home but his employees  
 all live outside the area.
