		<title>15WAITROSE - ROMSEY</title>
		<content> During our visit to Waitrose, we were 
 able to ask many questions.  We were  
 told that a Mr Waite and a Mr Rose put
 their names together to make Waitrose 
 Supermarket.  The Romsey branch opened
 in 1970 and about ninety people now   
 work there.  Their main competitors   
 are Sainsburys in Lordshill and       
 Carrefour in Eastleigh.  We were told 
 that Waitrose may have become very    
 popular for the great variety of goods
 sold.  In 1985, people want very clean
 food but they also like to choose it  
 for themselves.  Waitrose has had a   
 few problems with their car park.     
 Their new system works well but some  
 people still park there when they     
 shouldn't.  Building a multi-storey   
 car park might help, but it would     
 probably spoil the Romsey skyline.    
 Waitrose would like to expand in the  
 future because they are short of space</content>
