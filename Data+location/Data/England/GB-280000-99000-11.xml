		<title>11Children's Day in Crediton</title>
		<content>   This year there was a{children's day
 in{Newcombe's Meadow,}which is a park.
 It was the first one of what the      
 organisers hope will be many. It was  
{organised by}my mum and several of her
 friends.                              
   We had inflatables, trampolines,    
 stalls and a theatre. Next year they  
 hope to have more inflatables and     
 fewer adult things .                  
   The{money}that was raised went to   
{Ethiopia}and{children's charities.    
 They raised about{Â£400}altogether.    
   It was held on the{May Day}Bank     
 Holiday because everyone had a day off
 school and work.                      
   I hope there will be many more      
 because it was{fun}for everyone and   
 the money went to a good cause.
