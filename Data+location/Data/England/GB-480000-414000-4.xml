		<content> A committee was formed to raise funds 
 for a new hall on July 10th 1978. The 
 meeting was held in the old hall.     
 Money in the bank at that time was    
 about Â£12, by August 22nd 1979 this   
 had risen to Â£2,212 due to fund       
 raising efforts by villagers and      
 others too numerous to mention. The   
 old hall was demolished in June 1979. 
 Financial assisstance was applied for 
 and granted in 1984. The estimated    
 cost was Â£33,000 half of this to come 
 from Humberside County Council, 15%   
 from Boothferry District Council, 25% 
 from the Village Hall Committee and   
 10% from the Parish Council. A builder
 from Eastoft was voted by the Hall    
 committee to begin work on July 13th  
 1984. The work was completted and the 
 new Hall opened on March 16th 1985 by

 Council.                              </content>
