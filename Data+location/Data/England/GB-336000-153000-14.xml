		<content>   LOXTON VILLAGE IS SITUATED  ON THE  
WESTERN SIDE OF THE LOX YEO VALLEY AT  
THE JUNCTION OF THE VALLEY ROAD AND THE
BANWELL ROAD.                          
   IT IS A PICTURESQUE VILLAGE,        
DIFFERINGFROM MOST MENDIP VILLAGES IN  
THE ARCHITECTURAL STYLE OF ITS LARGEST 
HOUSE,THE MANOR.IT RESEMBLES A         
MEDITERRANEAN BUILDING,RATHER THAN AN  
ENGLISH BUILDING,AND WITH THE CHURCH,IT
DOMINATES THE VILLAGE.                 
   THE MANOR DOMINATED THE LOXTON AREA 
FOR MANY CENTURIES.THE CHURCH WAS BUILT
IN THE THIRTEENTH CENTURY AND ITS      
LIVING WAS IN THE GIFT OF THE MANOR.   
   ONLY THREE OF THE ORIGINAL FORMS    
REMAIN BUT THERE IS A                  
GARAGE,BLACKSMITH,CARPENTER AND VILLAGE
SHOP.                                  
   IT IS VERY MUCH SELF CONTAINED.     
                                       
                                       </content>
