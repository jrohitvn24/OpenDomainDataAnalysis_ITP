		<content> The present population within the grid
 area is about 500 people, and consists
 of an aging population with decreasing
 numbers of young families. Council    
 houses meant to house families of from
 5 to 6 now house one or two old people
 and many larger houses with room for 6
 - 10 occupants have only one or two.  
 There is a shifting population of     
 younger people moving in and out of   
 the more expensive houses -commuters  
 come and go as their work moves them  
 about the country.Each time a house   
 changes hands,the price rises by a few
 more thousand pounds, and less        
 well-offfamilies are priced out of the
 village.But those who move into the   
 grid area tend from town situations   
 tend to settle comfortably into the   
 life and rhythm of the village and    
 usually make valuable contributions to
 village life,activities and affairs.  </content>
