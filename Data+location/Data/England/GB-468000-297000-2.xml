		<title>02Illston - People's Lives</title>
		<content> The majority of the workforce in      
 the village now have to travel outside
 of Illston for employment.  Many      
 commute to Leicester.  There are a    
 substantial number of retired people  
 living in the village.                
 The village has no shop at all.       
 Mobile tradesmen in vans call once a  
 week i.e. butcher, greengrocer, fish  
 and chip vendor and baker.  Due to the
 lack of shops a large number of resid-
 ents own freezers to keep a supply    
 of food.  Many grow their own         
 vegetables.  Milk is delivered every  
 other day to the customer's doorstep. 
 Most people have a television set.    
 Morning newspapers are not delivered  
 but the Leicester Mercury, an evening 
 paper is delivered Monday to Saturday 
 and Sunday papers are brought from    
 Kibworth.School children are collected
 and returned by bus daily.            </content>
