		<title>07LACE IN BEDFORD</title>
		<content> In 1977 a group called the {Aragon    
{Lacemakers }was set up in response to 
 a nationwide interest in lacemaking.  
 It started with 30 members and now has
 120 adult members and 60 juniors. They
 meet every six weeks and have speakers
 and outings to places of interest for 
 lacemakers. They also have two open { 
{Lace Days}a year when they demonstrate
 lacemaking. This interest has been    
 taken up by local schools and there   
 are six schools in Bedford which      
 teach lacemaking. The children are    
 supplied with polystyrene lace pillows
 and plastic bobbins and are taught    
 basic lace patterns. Our local museum 
 and art gallery has many fine examples
 of lace.
