		<content> Rural area consisting of mainly arable
 land slightly undulating, rising to   
 approximately 200 feet above sea level
 at the cliffs at TRIMINGHAM.   It     
 includes the upper part of the        
 sizeable (by Norfolk standards)       
 village of SOUTHREPPS, and the        
 outskirts TRIMINGHAM, and THORPE      
 MARKET.  Also included is the fairly  
 sizeable private estate of TEMPLEWOOD.
                                       
 An ever changing panorama of wonderful
 sunsets offset by the high skies.     
 Prevailing winds give rise to stark   
 and sometimes eerie shapes, as trees  
 bend, and become tortured.            
                                       
 There are a number of listed buildings
 (some itemised in the text).    Where 
 new buildings have beeb erected, in   
 the main an attempt has been made to  
 evoke the traditional Norfolk style.  </content>
