		<content> The swimming pool was built in 1913,  
 then it was owned by Balland Huyshe   
 who built it out of a clay pit.He used
 it as a swimming pool for children    
 whoes parents had gone abroad.The     
 children would stay in village and go 
 to the pool every day.In the war it   
 was used as a rubbish dump.In         
 1955/1956 it was given to the village 
 by the Huyshe family, since there has 
 been huts and changing rooms          
 installed.The pool holds 70000        
 gallons of water.                     
                                       
 The village hall is near the swimming 
 pool it was built in 1976,it is used  
 for dances, plays, jumble sales,      
 auctions and is general public use.An 
 oak tree was planted for the Silver   
 Jubilee there.
