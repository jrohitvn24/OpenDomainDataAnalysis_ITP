		<content>   Kettlewell's buildings are of local 
 stones, to blend naturally with the   
 surrounding scenery. seventy-five     
 houses are permanently occupied,      
 forty-seven are unoccupied for long   
 periods, being mainly holiday         
 cottages.  There are no derelict      
 buildings.  Several structures are    
 graded as listed buildings, including 
 the main bridge over the Wharfe, being
 rebuilt to the original design this   
 year after a partial collapse in      
 February. A Bailey Bridge and the only
 traffic-lights in the whole dale have 
 been temporarily installed to control 
 single flow traffic, which can be     
 heavy at certain times.               
   The village has a church, primary   
 school, village hall and a small      
 Methodist chapel, which has closed    
 this year because of high expense and 
 a dwindling congregation.             </content>
