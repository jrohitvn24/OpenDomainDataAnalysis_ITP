		<title>14CRICKET CLUB,SPARSHOLT.</title>
		<content>  Sparsholt Cricket club offers the    
 main activity in the village.The mens 
 team is at the top of the Second      
 Division of the Hampshire League.The  
 adult team has been going since 1880  
 and the colts (boys' team) since 1981.
 I have been playing since March 1985. 
 On Thursdays at 6.00p.m.I go to the   
 cricket field for coaching.We learn   
 how to bowl,catch and throw, after    
 that we have a practice match.If it is
 raining we usually have coaching      
 videos. On Sundays we play proper     
 matches against other colt teams.I    
 usually am the wicketkeeper or a      
 deep-fielder because I have a strong  
 throw and good aim.                   
  The Parish Council gave a grant for  
 the new pavilion to be built,with a   
 clause that youth cricket must be     
 encouraged.This was opened in 1980 by 
 Cecil Paris,a famous old cricketer.   </content>
