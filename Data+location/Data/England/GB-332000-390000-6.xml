		<content>   To make way for the  proposed  large
 park,  a number of high-rise flats and
 maisonettes  are  to  be  demolished. 
                                       
   Most  residents  have  already  been
 rehoused  in  alternative  areas  but 
 those who still live or work here  are
 of one  mind, {opposing }the  project.
{                                      
{  Rev. J. Charley,}whose  church  lies
 within the park boundaries, is helping
 people  who  find  the  prospect  of  
 rehousing daunting. He has also helped
 other residents to form  action groups
 to  try to find a solution so that the
{community spirit}which{has grown}since
 the slum clearance  of the  1960's  is
 retained  wherever they are  rehoused.
                                       
   No matter who one asks, the  overall
 picture  is one of{ anger} that such a
 close knit community can be destroyed.</content>
