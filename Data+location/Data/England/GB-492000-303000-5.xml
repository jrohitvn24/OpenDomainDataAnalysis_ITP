		<title>05Birthday Party-N.Luffenham</title>
		<content> There was a party in North Luffenham  
 to celebrate the 7th birthday of a    
 girl.This is the account of one of the
 guests:_"Daddy took me to the party.I 
 won a lot of prizes and we had a      
 treasure hunt looking for different   
 coloured flowers.We played Pass the   
 Parcel and if you got it you would    
 have to do a forfeit.You got a        
 lollipop if you got it right.We       
 played Hunt the Thimble. When it was  
 tea_time, I had lots of biscuits and  
 cakes. The birthday cake was shaped   
 like a basket with sweets in it. There
 was another game called Cut the       
 Chocolate. You try to throw six on a  
 dice and if you do, you put on some   
 gloves and a hat and try to cut the   
 chocolate with a knife &amp; fork. When   
 our Mums came we all got a party bag  
 containing "My Little Pony" stickers, 
 sweets and a bit of the cake.GREAT!"  </content>
