The area covered by this part of the   
Survey is part of what is sometimes    
called the Solway Plane. The land is   
very flat and fertile, and its main use
is given over to farming.              
There are no large centres of          
population rather a number a small     
hamlets (less than 20 homes in each).  
There is no centre of population to    
which people can gather so the school  
is the focus for all activities, this  
itself is isolated, the only other     
building nearby being the Parish       
Church. There is very little new       
building in the area, due mainly to the
fact that there is no public sewage    
system and therefore people have to    
rely on septic tanks. There is,        
therefore no growth in the population  
of this area.
