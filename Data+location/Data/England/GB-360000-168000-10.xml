		<content> At{Whitchurch Sports Centre}there are 
 facilities for badminton, weights,    
 trampolining, gymnastics, football,   
 squash and basketball. The price of   
 these facilities from badminton which 
 is about Â£1.50 an hour, five-a-side   
 football at Â£4.50 for the pitch, and  
 gymnastics at Â£10.25 for a 10 week    
 session. These sports can be played   
 throughout the year. Most of the      
 sports have to be booked and paid for 
 in advance. For many, especially      
 gymnastics and trampolining, there is 
 a waiting list. During the school     
 holidays there is a children's hour   
 costing Â£0.40p.                       
 I find the facilities good and use    
 them regularly. However the centre    
 could be improved by building a       
 swimming pool. Also more tuition for  
 different sports is needed.
