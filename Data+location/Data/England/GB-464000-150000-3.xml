		<title>03Washing Up</title>
		<content> We{wash up}by putting the{dirty dishes
 in the{sink.}The{sink}is a{square tub 
 with a hole in the bottom that has    
 lots of little holes in it; it is     
 called a{plughole.}It also has another
 square hole at the back, so if you put
 too much{water}in the{sink}it will    
 flood out of the hole. On the top of  
 the sink are{taps}that let water into 
 the sink, one is for hot water and one
 is for cold. You put the{plug}in the  
{plughole.}The{plug}is a piece of      
{rubber}connected to a{chain,}it is the
 same size and shape as the{plughole   
 and fits in perfectly. Then you turn  
 the hot and cold water{taps}and you   
 get warm water. As you are doing this 
 you put in the{washing up liquid,     
 which is a combination of different   
{chemicals}that makes the water        
 bubbley. You{wash up}and{drain        
 everything. By Maria O'Donnell        </content>
