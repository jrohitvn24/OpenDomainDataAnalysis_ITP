 years of age and attend until they are
 15 if they are girls, or for life if  
 they are boys. In the Mosque girls    
 wear cloaks with hoods called{burks.} 
 Boys wear hats called{topees.}Before  
 touching the Koran, any person must   
 have washed hands, face, legs &amp; hair. 
     The{Hindu Temple}is very quiet.   
 Children might listen to a reading    
 from a sacred book. There may be      
 dancing on a special occasion.        </content>
