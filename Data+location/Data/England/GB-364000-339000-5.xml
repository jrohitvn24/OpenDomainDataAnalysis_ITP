		<content>                                       
 In 1985 the canal is mainly used by   
 tourists.People from all over the     
 world come to the canal including     
 succesful Canadians and Americans. The
 villagers use the canal a lot to fish 
 and to go for walks.Our locks are     
 looked after by Mr Butter.He has won  
 three competitions in 1980 and 1982   
 for he dug out flower borders in      
 recent years.  Things like Adderley   
 and BWB were dug out on the bank and  
 blue flowers were planted in the      
 shapes. The barge has been taken away 
 now and left just the BWB.He has also 
 done D&amp;C commemorating the marriage of
 Prince Charles.The flowers are        
 colourful and appreciated.Mr Butter is
 a big ,strong,kind and particularly   
 anxious to get on with things.
