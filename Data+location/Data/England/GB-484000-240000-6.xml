		<title>06ARRIVING IN MILTON KEYNES</title>
		<content> My name is Dat Than. this is how I    
 came to Milton Keynes. I was born in  
 Vietnam. At age five I had to move to 
 England so our family went into a     
 small boat. We set off , it was a     
 rough journey and our family faced    
 shipwreck at sea but luckily we got   
 rescued. We were taken to Hong Kong,  
 there we stayed at a large police     
 station for a few weeks then we were  
 taken to the airport and flown to     
 England. There I stayed at Bournemouth
 for a few months in a refugee camp but
 the refugee camp became too full so   
 our family had to move to another     
 place. They took our family to Milton 
 Keynes and that's how I came here.
