		<title>20BICESTER'S POLLUTION</title>
		<content>As in any market town,the problem of   
rubbish dropped in the streets is      
particularly acute after Market Day    
(Friday).Bicester stream is often      
pollutth empty take-away containers and
Tesco trollies.                        
Bicester is surrounded by open fields. 
A wide variety of birds is found in the
town as well as foxes, rabbits, rodents
and other forms of wildlife.           
Being an old town,Bicester contains    
many buildings dating from the         
seventeenth century.These have         
preservation orders on them and several
have recently undergone cleaning to    
remove black deposits caused by air    
pollution and traffic.The large number 
of roadworks currently in the town     
centre have greatly increased the dust 
and noise pollution.
