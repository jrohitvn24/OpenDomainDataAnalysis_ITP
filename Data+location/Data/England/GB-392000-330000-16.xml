		<title>16FARMYARDS, BURSTON AREA</title>
		<content>                                       
There are 22 farmyards in this area,   
most built of bricks and slates. Three 
are no longer farms.  One was a stud.  
Six have no new buildings but have     
utilised or demolished old units as    
necessary.  One farm has an old round  
house for horsework.  Twelve have new  
buildings made of concrete blocks,     
corregated asbestos and wood slats. 1  
has traditional brick built additions. 
                                       
These new structures are used for      
milking parlours, bull pens, winter    
stalls, calf and bullock rearing,      
slurry pits, storing grain and silage. 
                                       
Most farms are owned by Sandon Estate, 
one by another landlord, 3 are owner   
occupied.  One of these has new build- 
ings in a field away from the house to 
avoid a B road and level crossing.     </content>
