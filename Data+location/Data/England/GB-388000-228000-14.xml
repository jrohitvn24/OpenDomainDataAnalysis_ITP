		<title>14ST.JAMES THE GREAT</title>
		<content> Except for a few minor alterations the
{Nave}of the Church remains as it was  
 in the twelfth century.  A pleasing   
 feature of the Church are the{wall    
{paintings,}unique in England for their
 detail and variety, where the whole   
 central zone of the Nave is devoted to
 the life of{St. James the Great.  In  
 the twelfth century, the shrine of St.
 James at Compostella in Northern Spain
 was an important centre of pilgrimage.
  St. James was venerated as the oldest
 of the apostles and, since he was the 
 first to suffer martydom, as the      
 first apostle to enter heaven.  The   
 dedication of the Church reflects the 
 widespread cult of the saint.  It is  
 likely that the paintings were the    
 gift of a wealthy patron or Lord of   
 the Manor, possibly   as a result of a
 pilgrimage.  The first scheme of      
 paintings are fragmentary .           </content>
