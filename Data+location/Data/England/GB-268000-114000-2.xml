		<content> the flood plain of the River Little   
 Dart that the American Life Magazine  
 team took the picture looking up to   
 Chulmleigh which became their cover   
 picture for their book on Britain. The
 streams and rivers have incised the   
 200 metre plateau. The population of  
 Chulmleigh has for centuries been     
 about 1200.                           
{ATTITUDES}  Compared to urban areas,  
 life in a Mid Devon rural area tends  
 to be more casual, slower, more       
 relaxed. Certainly a more enjoyable   
 quality of life is evident. People    
 passing on the streets wish each other
 the time of the day, mention the      
 weather, and not infrequently spend a 
 few minutes in a friendly discussion. 
 Everyone tends to know everyone's     
 business and, indeed, if someone is   
 ill people appear concerned and       
 readily volunteer to help-in-any-way! </content>
