 Admiral{Sir Mark Pizey}(now living in 
 Burnham) who had a distinguished Naval
 career.His father was vicar of Mark in
 1900 when he was born and when on     
 holiday in Richmond,Yorkshire,The     
 Reverend Pizey wrote to his           
 parishioners:".....Your little        
 namesake (Mark) is learning to make   
 great use of his legs and everyone    
 sayes does credit to our Somersetshire
 air......" A fascinating link with the
 past.                                 
 At the turn of the century there were 
 2{schools}in Mark. The West Mark
