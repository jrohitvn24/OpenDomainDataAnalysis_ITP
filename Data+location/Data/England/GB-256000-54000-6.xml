 being constructed in the area.The site
 manager enjoys the work earning about 
 Â£12,500 p.a.He is allowed a company   
 car.He has been based in Plymouth for

 next job.                             
  There is one factory under           
 construction but two more are planned.
 The finished building will cost about 
 Â£400,000 and cover about 3 acres.The

 firm to make{microchips}using local   
 labour for the work.

 April and should be finished by 28th  
 Oct.,or else a penalty will be
