		<content>  Following Vibroseis Seismic Survey   
 showing geological structures capable 
 of containing hydrocarbons the topsoil
 was removedfrom the 1.4 hectare site  
 and the area made level.A layer of    
 heavy duty polythene  was layed       
 followed by hard core(500 lorry loads)
 and asphelt.                          
 The site was surrounded by a          
 moat to hold ang possible spillage    
 An access road has been built         
 The firm will drill to the depth of   
 5000-6000 ft and drilling will        
 continue for about three weeks 24     
 hours a day.                          
  If the well is dry the site will     
 be retured to it's oringinal state    
 (all stone,asphelt removed)If oil is  
 found,a"nodding donkey"pump will be   
 used.                                 
 The site can not be seen from any     
 house.                                </content>
