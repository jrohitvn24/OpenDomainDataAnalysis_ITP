		<content>  IN BOURNEMOUTH THERE ARE JOBS WHICH  
 OTHER TOWNS DO NOT HAVE BECAUSE OF    
 THE BEACH, FOR EXAMPLE, THERE ARE JOBS
 LIKE WORKING IN KIOSKS ON THE PROM.   
 BOURNEMOUTH IS A SEASIDE TOWN SO A LOT
 OF MONEY IS MADE BY PEOPLE WHO OWN    
 HOTELS OR DO BED AND BREAKFAST.  THERE
 ARE QUITE A LOT OF TOURIST SHOPS.     
 THERE ARE NOT MANY FACTORIES IN       
 BOURNEMOUTH SO THERE ARE FEW JOBS IN  
 THAT AREA, ALTHOUGH THERE IS AN       
 ICE-CREAM FACTORY.  THERE ARE A LOT OF
 CAFES SO WAITRESSING JOBS ARE COMMON  
 AND THERE ARE QUITE A FEW SATURDAY    
 JOBS FOR YOUNG PEOPLE LIKE WASHING UP 
 IN HOTELS.                            
   IN BOURNEMOUTH THERE ARE MANY       
 OFFICES BUT MANY PEOPLE HAVE JOBS LIKE
 BEING A DOCTOR, MILKMAN, POSTMAN OR   
 NURSE.  HURN AIRPORT IS NEAR AND IT   
 PROVIDES LOTS OF JOBS FOR PEOPLE.
