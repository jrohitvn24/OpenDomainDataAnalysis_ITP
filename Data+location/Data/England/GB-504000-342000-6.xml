		<title>06SILK WILLOUGHBY VILLAGE HALL</title>
		<content>{Silk Willoughby village hall}was built
 in 1858 as a{school}run by the{Church 
{of England.                           
 In 1978 it was bought from the Church 
 authorities by the village and since  
 then has been run by a management     
 committee, formed of various members  
 from several organisations in the     
 community.  The hall is used by a     
 large percentage of the village       
 population.  A typical week would     
 start with{Sunday School,}held on     
 alternate Sundays. As the village no  
 longer has its own vicar, it is       
 supervised by a local school teacher  
 and her daughter. About 12 children   
 attend. On Tuesday, Wednesday and     
 Thursday mornings a{playgroup}is held 
 for between 15 and 20 children.       
 The hall is used as a{polling station 
 and for adults' and children's        
 parties.                              </content>
