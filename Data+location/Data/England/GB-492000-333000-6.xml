		<title>06Grantham:New Somerby</title>
		<content> The south-eastern suburb of New       
 Somerby was originally built after the
 area had been opened to housing after 
 the construction of the Grantham      
 Cemetary in the middle of the last    
 century.There is a chapel and a       
 crematorium in the cemetary           
 confines.Also there one can find      
 amongst the graves the memorial to    
 nearly 80 Grantham people killed in   
 air-raids during the Second World     
 War.The southern part of the suburb is
 largely a post-war development on     
 either side of Somerby Hill.On the    
 River Witham there is the very well   
 restored Spittlegate Mill now used as 
 Head Office premises by Vacu-Lug      
 Traction Tyres Ltd., whose factory for
 the reconditioning of tyres           
 remolding is in the north of Grantham.
