		<title>09Blandford - By-Pass</title>
		<content> The Blandford By-pass took a long time
 to make &amp; it means a lot to Blandford.
 Our school does not have many lorries 
 passing our classroom since the by-   
 pass was finished.There are 4 round-  
 abouts &amp; 2 bridges-one over the Stour 
 at Langton Long.The by-pass is on my  
 D-block map &amp; it passes through 4 of  
 the 1km squares.It is 4 miles long &amp;  
 cost Â£5 million pounds &amp; was opened in
 April this year.{Robin Queripel (9)

 I was surprised when they told us that
 the new Information Centre near the   
 Ham Car Park has had 3807 enquiries   
 from British tourists,290 from foreign
 people,344 telephone queries and 76 by
 post since it opened in April this    
 year.Sixteen volunteers work there and
 they gave us a Blandford Visitors     
 Trail and Walk-About.
