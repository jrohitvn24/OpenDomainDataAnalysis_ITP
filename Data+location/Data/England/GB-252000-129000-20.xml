		<content>   {CORFFE MANSION HOUSE DEVELOPMENT.  
                                       
  Corffe was until a few years ago the 
 latest home of Sir Bouchier Wrey - the
 local gentry of this area.  After     
 sale, when the Bouchier Wreys         
 emigrated to Africa, the house was    
 converted into flats.  The surrounding
 grounds are now in the hands of       
 property developers and cottages are  
 being built in very tasteful style in 
 keeping with original country cottages
 of the area.  It is developing into a 
 small holiday village, the cottages   
 being built for holiday home purchase 
 and hire.                             
{N.B.} Mansion type houses, barns and  
 older type cottages are being         
 converted to executive type dwellings 
 by developers at the present time. It 
 is becoming  big industry.
