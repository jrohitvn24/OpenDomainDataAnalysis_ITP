		<title>10RECREATION RIDING MK WESTON</title>
		<content>Shortgrove Lane is an unmetalled road  
(bridle path) between Market Weston &amp;  
Hopton that provides access for farm   
vehicles to the small fields on either 
side.These fields are generally culti- 
vated for cereal crops but one has veg-
etables &amp; two railway trucks as sheds. 
In summer the banks are overgrown      
with grass &amp; wild flowers. At the      
Hopton end are an old cottage and three
modern houses, one with a huge garden  
with model railway track. Near Market  
Weston there is a row of 10 trees. The 
lane is used by people walking and     
horseriding or, occasionally, on motor-
cycles. This is a favourite place for  
horseriding (a pastime in the area) and
one of the few where a horse can have  
a good gallop.
