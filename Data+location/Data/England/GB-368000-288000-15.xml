		<title>15MARLBROOK BRIDGE</title>
		<content>    {Marlbrook Bridge}is about 3 km.   
 outside Bridgnorth on the{Cleobury- } 
{Mortimer Road}(B4363). There have been
 a few crashes at this point because   
 the road is full of twists and        
 turns.In winter it is especially      
{dangerous}in frosty conditions.       
                                       
     Up the road they are cutting down 
 some{old trees}because they are       
 unsafe. As they want to preserve the  
 wood, they have planted some new      
 trees.                                
     The bridge is made out of         
{marlstone}and it has got two semi-    
 circular{arches.}The road narrows over
 Marl brook at this point. The banks   
 have been strengthened on the         
 Bridgnorth side. After Cleobury, the  
 road leads to{Ludlow}or{Bewdley.  }
