 The residential{Victoria Road}area of 
 Freshfield is an affluent one. Nearly 
 all of the houses have long curved    
 chipping drives lined with bushes. We 
 looked through the windows of a big   
 house and saw five televisions in     
 different rooms. Expensive cars       
 spotted outside the houses include a  
 Fiat X19, a Jaguar and a Mercedes. One
 garden has a summer house and a       
 rockery with a waterfall. Another has 
 a swimming pool with a diving board   
 and a slide. Another has a summer     
 house with a fish pond outside. Some  
 of the residents employ gardeners and 
 housekeepers. One large house has been
 converted into flats for old people.
