		<title>09CROPS ON A FEN EDGE FARM</title>
		<content>    Three crops are grown on{Chalk}    
{Farm}in a three-year rotation. They   
 are: wheat for flour, bread or        
 biscuits; barley, which is sold for   
 malting to make beer,whisky or        
 vinegar; and grass to make hay.       
    The grass acts as a 'break' crop   
 and gives the soil a rest. The farmer 
 grows only winter barley; in March,   
 while the barley is growing, the grass
 seed is sown amongst it and both crops
 grow together until the barley is cut 
 in August.                            
    There are no animals kept on the   
 farm apart from a pet dog and a goat. 
 The present farmer's father used to   
 keep both pigs and sheep, but they    
 were not very profitable and needed   
 someone to look after them every day  
 of the year.                          
                                       
                                       </content>
