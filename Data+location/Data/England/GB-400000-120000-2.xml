		<content> The Parish lies l0 miles SW of        
 Salisbury to which it naturally looks 
 for services. The main thoroughfare   
 through the Parish from Salisbury is a
 minor mettalled road. This has been   
 well repaired this year following     
 neglect &amp; bad deterioration.          
 There is no enforced speed limit:     
 blind corners &amp; hidden drives are     
 hazardous. The road branches at thhe  
 Post Office: one road goes NW to meet 
 the road from Broad Chalke to         
 Shaftesbury. The other road continues 
 through Woodminton to the Parish &amp;    
 County boundaries (1 mile), then on to
 the village of Sixpenny Handley &amp; A354
 (6 miles). There is one branch before 
 Woodminton; it goes SE &amp; connects a   
 few dwellings with A354. Heavy lorries
 use the village road as a short cut to
 Wilton from a local farm business and 
 from the A354.                        </content>
