 The village church is mainly a        
 nineteenth century building,having    
 been damaged by fire which            
 necessitated new building at that     
 time.It is not of great architectural 
 interest though small parts of the    
 building date from earlier times.For  
 example,the font is of Norman origin  
 and part of the north wall is of      
 historical interest. The church has a 
 spire and the nave has a main aisle   
 with a side aisle to the south so that
 there is an unbalanced appearance to  
 the nave.The chancel is situated at   
 the east end of the main aisle where  
 the altar is located but no choir     
 stalls.The organ is a modern          
 instrument located alongside the main 
 aisle at the western end where the    
 choir  stalls are.A new vicar was     
 appointed in October,1985..           </content>
