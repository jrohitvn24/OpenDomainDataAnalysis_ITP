		<content> Farming is the only industry of any   
 size operating in the block &amp; this    
 takes place in every square. It is    
 mainly constituted of mixed Grassland 
 &amp; Arable Farms, only 2 holdings being 
 entirely grass &amp; none entirely arable.
 Of 12 complete holdings with houses &amp; 
 buildings, 9 are situated outside the 
 village, all of these are owner       
 occupied. Three farms are situated in 
 or adjoining the village, one of these
 is owner occupied &amp; 2 are rented, but 
 both of the farmers who rent holdings 
 also own &amp; farm other land in the     
 block. Eleven of the 12 farms are in  
 excess of 130 acres. Most of the farms
 are run as family units using mainly  
 family labour, only 2 of the farms    
 employ a regular agricultural worker  
 although limited casual workers in the
 form of contractors &amp; seasonal labour 
 are employed.                         </content>
