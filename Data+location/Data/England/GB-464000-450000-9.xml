		<content>  Mrs.Stevenson has lived in Dunnington
 for forty four years since 1941.She   
 left school at fourteen and went to   
 work.During this time she went to     
 feasts at Barmby Moor and shows at    
 Bishop Wilton. She had no holidays    
 until she was married but they        
 celebrated Empire Day on the 24 and   
 Royal Oak Day on the 29 of May. On    
 Empire Day they walked around the     
 playground and saluted the Union      
 Jack. On Royal Oak Day everyone had to
 wear a piece of oak because of the    
 king who hid in an oak tree. During   
 the war she had evacuees from Hull and
 soldiers lived in the village. She had
 to do war work and spent some time    
 with the railways. She helped after   
 York Station was bombed. She vividly  
 remembers the Queen's coronation year,
 1953, when something different        
 happened every day.                   </content>
