		<content> The non-residential areas are mainly  
 used as intensively managed grassland.
 Two areas of deciduous woodland,      
 Nansavallan Wood and Penpoll Wood are 
 both Oak/Beech mixed woodland.        
 Hedgerows are of the granite stone and
 earth Cornish hedge type, which have  
 matured, with Elm and Hawthorn being  
 well-represented.                     
 The disused railway track running from
 Penwethers junction to Newham is now  
 unmanaged and reverting to woodland.  
 Dogrose, Blackthorn and Holly are     
 common.                               
 The estuary of the Truro river        
 provides an extensive area of mud flat
 at low water and constitutes a winter 
 feeding ground for a wide variety of  
 wading birds.                         
 The National Trust land at Calenick, a
 silted stream bed, forms a wet area   
 now largely undisturbed by man.       </content>
