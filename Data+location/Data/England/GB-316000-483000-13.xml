		<title>13OUT AND ABOUT, THWAITES</title>
		<content> Out and About is our local magazine   
 and it is full of news of the area, a 
 calendar of events and adverts. It was
 started in June 1984 by two ladies,   
 who live locally, to tell people what 
 things were happening in the area, and
 so that the village hall would be used
 more. The Parish Council gave Â£10 to  
 launch it. Since then it has been     
 kept going by donations and small     
 advertisements.                       
 The ladies collect up all of the      
 information for this magazine. One of 
 the ladies edits it and it is printed 
 free by a business man. It circulates 
 around all of the Thwaites area and   
 part of Millom. Some people from The  
 Green and The Hill deliver about 200  
 copies. You do not have to pay for it.
 It comes out once a month. People say 
 that events are better supported since
 Out and About started.                </content>
