		<content>The block, mainly open country,includes
Filkins, a village of 300, and touches 
the village of Eastleach.  It straddles
the Oxon-Glos boundary and is crossed  
by the A361 between Burford and Lech-  
lade.  The block covers the old parish 
of Filkins which lies on the first rise
of the Cotswolds from the Thames       
Valley, just to the north of the golden
corridor of thriving industry that     
runs from London to Bristol. Three     
miles to the east is RAF Brize Norton. 
Fast-growing Swindon, l5 miles to the  
south, exerts increasing influence.    
Local government offices and hospitals 
are in Oxford and Witney. The needs of 
Filkins as a Cotswold village          
(conservation &amp; tourism) are not as    
well understood by Oxon CC as are      
those of Eastleach by Glos CC.   Both  
villages have lost their schools and   
neither has complete main drainage.    </content>
