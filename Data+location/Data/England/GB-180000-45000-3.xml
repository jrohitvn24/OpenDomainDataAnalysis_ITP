 divided into three tiers:             
                                       
{ 1.}The Community Policeman

         Patrols, etc.)                
{ 3.}The Specialist Departments (C.I.D.
         Mobile Policing, Dog,         
         Underwater Search, Helicopter 
         and Administration Section)   
                                       
{The job of the Community Policeman}is 
 to patrol his area and to liaise with 
 members of the public. His tasks also 
 include visiting schools and meeting  
 children, fostering a good relation-  
 ship with them. The final result being

 responsible citizens. Complaints to   
 the police are investigated by him and
