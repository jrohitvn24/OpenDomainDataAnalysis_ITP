		<content> Man made water areas are the          
 predominant features of this block    
 comprising, two reservoirs (The Queen 
 Mother at Datchet and the Wraysbury   
 Reservoir) and the irregularly shaped 
 lakes remaining after gravel          
 extraction. The Queen Mother Reservoir
 and the gravel lakes now provide      
 leisure activities in the form of     
 sailing and fishing.                  
 Scattered between water areas is the  
 remnant of the farmland which used to 
 predominate, the farming inhabitants  
 having now largely given way to a     
 commuting population in the villages  
 of Wraysbury, Horton and Stanwell     
 Moor.                                 
 A commercial/industrial trading estate
 has been , and continues to be        
 developed in Poyle, situated as it is 
 so conveniently close to Junction 14  
 of Londons new orbital motorway,      </content>
