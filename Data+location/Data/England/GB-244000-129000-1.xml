		<title>01GENERAL INTRODUCTION</title>
		<content> Two thirds of our area is land and one
 third is covered by water, which is   
 mostly estuary but some is open sea.  
                                       
 Of the land the main use is rough     
 grazing with about one sixth being    
 used for building.                    
                                       
 The tree main settlements are the     
 small towns of Appledore and Northam  
 and the village of Instow. Both       
 Northam and Appledore appeard in the  
 first Doomsday Book.                  
                                       
 It is an area of grea beauty and many 
 people visit it for holidays.
