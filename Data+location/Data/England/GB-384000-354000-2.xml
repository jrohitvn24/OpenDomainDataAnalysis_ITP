		<title>02EMPLOYMENT MINING ,SERVICES</title>
		<content>The main employment in the area used   
to be mining.We can see this from the  
number of disused mine shafts,         
particularly in the Mount Pleasant     
area. A mineral railway used to run    
past Thursfield Lodge but this has now 
been taken up.Most of the area is now  
used for farming,this is now the main  
employment in the area.Other jobs are  
small shops,garages,pubs,schools and   
churches.There is a milk depot where a 
number of people are employed to drive 
milk floats. There is also a small     
clothing factory in the Dales Green    
area. There are several building sites 
employing people as bricklayers,       
builders and carpenters.There are also 
council workers who drive the buses    
through the area,mend the roads,clean  
the streets and empty the dustbins.Some
people work as postmen in the area.
