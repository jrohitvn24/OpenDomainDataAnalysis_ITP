      We have a set of apparatus       
 in the Infants playground and some    
 hopscotches.  Each class swims every  
 day for 30 mins.  Our swimming pool is
 heated but needs repairing. A         
 committee has been set up to raise    
 #2500 for repairs. Nearly #700 has    
 been raised by pupils from sponsored  
 swims, a disco and other activities.  
 We have a football pitch which we also
 use for rounders.                     
      Today,Monday 8 July 1985 we have 
 a Frenchman in our school trying to   
 improve his English.                  
 His name is Pierre and he is very     
 nice.  He played rounders with us and 
 although he had never played before he
 scored two rounders.  Our school is   
 divided into three Houses and each    
 summer we have a sports day to find   
 the top House.                        </content>
