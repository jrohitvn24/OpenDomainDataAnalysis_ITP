		<content> We have about 17km. of metalled road  
 and 2km. of tracks.There is only one  
 short public footpath at Cork.Since   
 1965 two footpaths have been lost,    
 because no one uses them.The County   
 Council has bought the old rail track 
 and soon it should be a public way.   
 Anyone who drives fast on our roads is
 silly,as there are narrow places,     
 dangerous bends and crossroads.There  
 have been bumps,but luckily no serious
 accidents.Transport for shopping is a 
 problem without a car,but we have a   
 Post Office with general store and a  
 shop at the chalet camp at Ruthern    
 Bridge.A mobile shop covers most of   
 the area.Milk is delivered every third
 day.There is a weekly visit from the  
 Library van,meals on wheels,and a     
 hospital car service.There are buses  
 for shopping on Tuesday and Friday.   
 Some older people use Bodmin taxis.   </content>
