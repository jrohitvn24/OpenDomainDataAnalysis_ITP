		<title>04AUNSBY VILLAGE.</title>
		<content> Aunsby never became estate-owned and  
 its properties have changed hands     
 without the long periods of neglect   
 and decay with associated loss of     
 population that has characterised some
 local villages.Former agricultural    
 dwellings have become the homes of    
 people employed in neighbouring towns.
 Most village events are to raise money
 for the restoration of the ancient    
 church dedicated to Thomas a Becket.A 
 most popular annual event is the brawn
 and ham tea on the village green.Its  
 tiny village hall,once the school,is  
 the venue for rummage sales and whist 
 drives as well as being a polling     
 station at election times.The post    
 office operates from the front room of
 an ordinary house and buying a stamp  
 is a social call.
