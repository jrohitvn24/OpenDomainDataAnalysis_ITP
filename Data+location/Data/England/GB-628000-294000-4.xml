 other businesses have 2 or more.There 
 is a reasonable postal service.The    
 post is collected weekdays mid-morning
 &amp; afternoon,&amp; there is a morning      
 delivery,but no Sunday collection.    
 Daily papers &amp; magazines are sold &amp;   
 delivered by the owners of the village
 shop;Sunday papers by a person from   
 outside the area,&amp; a few have their   
 periodicals by post.Each month a free 
 news-sheet from the Hempnall Group of 
 parishes is given to every family in  
 Woodton.This has news of church &amp;     
 local affairs,including baptisms,     
 marriages &amp; burials.                  
 A mobile{library}from Norfolk County  
 service visits villages monthly.It    
 brings a selection of books,which the 
 librarian has learnt will be of       
 interest,&amp; people may order others.   </content>
