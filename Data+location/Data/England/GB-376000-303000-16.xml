		<content> The housing in the study area is of   
 three types.The main type being the   
 barrack blocks of R.A.F Cosford. The  
 other types being the large houses    
 on the farms and estates and the farm 
 cottages and cottages along the A464. 
  The barrack block at Cosford consists
 of two storey buildings in which      
 airmen have a single private room for 
 living and sleeping in rather like a  
 flat.Nearly 200 airmen are housed in  
 each block.                           
  The large estate houses range from   
 Elizabethan to Victorian style        
 houses.Hatton Grange is atypical      
 example of this type.It was built in  
 1764 and has undergone a number of    
 changes since.                        
  Peel Cottage is typical of the third 
 type.It was built in 1894 with only 8 
 rooms but was extended to 13 rooms in 
 1973.Many other cottages are modern.  </content>
