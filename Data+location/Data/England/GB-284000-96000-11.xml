		<title>11THE GOLF COURSE,HOOKWAY.</title>
		<content>  The golf course covers eighty seven  
 and a half acres,not all in our block,
 which is small for a golf course. It  
 was established in 1975.              
{ A set of golf clubs costs Â£120.}Golf 
 ball sizes are 1.62 ins. and          
 1.68(American).                       
  It takes quite a few years just to   
 learn golf.But if you are a           
{professional,}like Mr. Millhouse, you 
 have to teach people to play golf     
 which is a skill in itself.You have to
 serve a{three year apprenticeship}to  
 become a professional.                
   The golf course has a{junior section
{and a ladies day.}Anyone under        
 eighteen is classed as a junior. "In  
 Britain golf is a cheap sport,"       
 declared Mr.Millhouse.On average the  
 cost of joining a{club is Â£2 a week.  
{  Between fifty and a hundred people  
{play everyday on this course.         </content>
