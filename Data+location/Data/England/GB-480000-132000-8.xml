		<title>08Orchid Business, Passfield.</title>
		<content> This flourishing business was started 
 14 years ago and is run personally by 
 the owner with 1 regular assistant and
 2 to 3 casual helpers when required.  
 The orchids are propagated and grown  
 on the premises.The peak flowering    
 season is early January to late       
 May;during this period the flowers,in 
 specialised packing,are distributed to
 wholesale outlets mainly florists and 
 large hotels in London and are also   
 retailed both by post and direct.     
  Near Easter the orchid houses have   
 been open to delight visitors and to  
 aid the Red Cross.The tall spikes of  
 Cymbidium orchids rise 4 feet from    
 beds of wood bark,peat,vermiculite and
 fertiliser, with up to 25 blooms on a 
 spike.The subtle shades of colour,pink
 green, white, yellow, terra-cotta and 
 lovely browns tempt anyone to send an 
 orchid 'direct'.                      </content>
