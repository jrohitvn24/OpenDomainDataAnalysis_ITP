		<content>    Seddon Estate is an area of new    
 expensive housing in Chelford close to
 the village and Peck Mill Farm. The   
 building started eleven years ago and 
 is expected to continue for another   
 three years. The price range at       
 present is Â£52000 to Â£87000. The      
 houses are modern, spacious, detached 
 houses of various designs with        
 gardens.It is a friendly neighbourhood
 where most people know each other.    
 There is a full time gardener for the 
 estate.                               
    This is what we found out from the 
 questionnaires we handed out. Most    
 people have lived on the estate       
 between one and two years. About half 
 the people are new to the area and the
 others have come from nearby areas.   
 Most people find the estate quiet and 
 peaceful and love its position in the 
 countryside.They all enjoy life there.</content>
