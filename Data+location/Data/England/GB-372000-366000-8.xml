		<title>08CRANAGE SCHOOL</title>
		<content>      Our school was built in 1705 by  
 Thomas Hall, who aiso built Cranage   
 Hall. Part of it  is not a school at  
 all, but is a rented house. There are 
 only two classroom, a library area,   
 and dining room ,kitcten and toilets. 
 The toilets used to be outside in the 
 playground , but two years ago an     
 extension was built onto the school to
 put in toilets for the pupils and the 
 staff.                                
      Because of the size of the school
 there are only a few children here.In 
 the infants there are 15 children and 
 22 in the juniors. There is also our  
 headmaster,one Full-time  teacher, one
 part-time teacher and three kitchen   
 ladies. Our cookhas worked here for 21
 years and now has a very modern       
 kitchen to work in. not all of the    
 school children have school dinner but
 some bring packed lunches.            </content>
