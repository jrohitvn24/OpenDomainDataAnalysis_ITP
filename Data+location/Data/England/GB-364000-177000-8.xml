		<content>{BRISSLE}- Most people in this area    
 speak mild Bristolian,which means that
 they add an l to words,for example,   
 America becomes Americal and a girls  
 name Tanya,would become Tanyal e.g.   
{ "Nigerial is a malarial arial"       
 They also mis-pronounce some words    
 like "think" is said "fink" and "our" 
 is said "are". Bristol was called     
 Brigstow until Bristolian accent      
 changed it.
