		<content>  Our school, a{Preparatory day school,
 has 140 boys and girls aged 5-13. We  
 are very smart in our scarlet blazers 
 and grey skirts or trousers.          
  The Headmistress since 1969 has been 
{Miss. J.Norton.}There are 19 staff,   
 mostly ladies. The main building is a 
 post Victorian house, with many modern
 extensions in the large garden. Our   
 facilities are good, especially in the
 laboratory and art-room. Music is very
 important in school. We have a BBC    
 computer with disc-drive and printer. 
  We have to work hard and are given   
 homework each day except Friday. Many 
 pupils take Common Entrance exams and 
 go on to Public schools.              
  This is a private fee-paying school  
 and pupils come from up to 15 miles   
 away. We all stay for lunch, cooked or
 packed. Cooked lunch is a set menu and
 is usually very good.                 </content>
