		<content>       THE COOMBE HILL CANAL           
   The Coombe Hill Canal was opened in 
 1796 from the River Severn at Wainlode
 to Coombe Hill 4 kilometres away. It  
 ran through the low lying meadows from
 west to east and effectively divides  
 the rectangle into two and separates  
 the villages of Lower Apperley and The
 Leigh. It was built to bring coal from
 the Forest of Dean and the Midlands   
 together with building materials      
 closer to the expanding spa town of   
 Cheltenham, when roads in the Severn  
 Vale were in a very poor condition.   
   It was proposed to extend it to     
 Cheltenham but lack of money prevented
 this and then the railways were built.
 The canal still holds water but the   
 lock at the Severn end has been filled
 in. The wharf and buildings remain at 
 Coombe Hill.
