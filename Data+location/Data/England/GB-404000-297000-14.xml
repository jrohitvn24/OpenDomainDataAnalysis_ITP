		<title>14Freezers and Fridge Freezers</title>
		<content> In our class there are 29 children but
 on the day there were 26. There are   
{16 people who have a freezer.}Freezers
 are useful because you can put food   
 in them like chips, meat, peas, ice   
 cream and ice lollies. Sometimes      
 people freeze carrots. There is a lot 
 of food you can freeze in freezers.   
 There are{24 people who have got      
{fridge freezers.}You can put chocolate
 and milk in the fridge freezer. We can
 keep food in tins like salmon, peas,  
 corned beef, beans, tomatoes and      
 carrots. We keep our breakfast cereals
 in cupboards like cornflakes and      
 weetabix.
