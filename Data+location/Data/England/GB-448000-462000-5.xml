		<content> farmers have a fold yard and at one   
 farm we were allowed to go into the   
 fold yard with the cattle.Two of the  
 farmers have a cattle shed.Some of the
 farmers have old brick buildings that 
 they use for storage.One farmer has a 
 pig unit used for rearing pigs.       
                                Eight  
 farmers have a combine harvester most 
 of these have a large farm.As we      
 visited the farms we saw tractors,    
 ploughs,seed drills,potato harvesters,
 harrows,trailers,balers,sugar beet    
 harvesters,fork lifts,a side hoe,     
 rollers,sprayers and muck spreaders.  
   Nearly all the farms are family     
 farms. One farm has a manager.Six     
 farms have belonged to the same family
 for a 100 years or more,six for 30    
 years or more and two for 20 years or 
 less.The old farm houses are brick    
 built and very attractive.            </content>
