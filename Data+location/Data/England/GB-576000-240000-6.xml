		<content>{Ovington }is a tiny village about two 
 miles from Belchamp St.Paul. There    
 are now only 55 people living there   
 whereas, before the{Second World      
{War,}1939-1945, there were more than  
 300. Twelve houses and a whole        
 farm,{'Hole Farm',}were demolished so 
 that Ridgewell airfield could be built
 for the war effort. Those houses have 
 never been rebuilt. Another reason for
 the{drop in population}is the change  
 in agriculture. Where it used to take 
 16 men to work on a 400 acre farm now,
 just 2 men can do the work. People    
 move away from the village to work in 
 the towns. So houses become empty and 
 are demolished. There is no shop in   
 Ovington, people go to Clare,         
 Haverhill and Sudbury. There was a    
 public house in Ovington called{The   
{Donkey,}but it closed down over 20    
 years ago.                            </content>
