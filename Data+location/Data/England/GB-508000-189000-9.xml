		<title>09MARTINS - THE NEWSAGENTS</title>
		<content> Martins is a newsagents situated near 
 the bottom end of Joel Street at the  
 roundabout.It is a good shop which has
 a lot of friendly staff who are always
 willing to lend a helping hand.Also   
 Martins sells a really good assortment
 of sweets and confectionery which is  
 really cheap and of good value.Also   
 they have very good bargain days and  
 some things are sold at half price. It
 has a morning paper delivery service  
 that has been going for 37 years and  
 some regulars have been receiving     
 papers from the very start.The        
 delivery charge is 41p a week and the 
 paper delivered between 6 a.m. to 7.15
 a.m. but the shop opens at 4.45 a.m.I 
 do a paper round, getting to work at 5
 a.m. and home again at 7.30 a.m.I play
 inter-shop soccer for the Martins     
 under-21s.
