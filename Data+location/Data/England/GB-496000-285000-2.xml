		<content> The main crops that are grown are     
 barley , wheat and rape. Wheat is a   
 very profitable crop to the farmer as 
 it can be grown continuously and has a
 relatively low labour input. Oilseed  
 rape has become an increasingly       
 popular crop in this area and during  
 the last few weeks of May the area is 
 a mass of yellow. The farmers' reason 
 for growing rape is that it is a very 
 good break crop to follow milling     
 wheat. After combining rape there is  
 plenty of time to cultivate the land  
 before sowing wheat etc. in October.  
 Barley especially winter barley which 
 yields better than spring barley , is 
 grown as it is combined at the end of 
 July so that rape which mostly follows
 can be sown at the end of August.
