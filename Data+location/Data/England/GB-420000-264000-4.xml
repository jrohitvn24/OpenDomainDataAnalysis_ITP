		<title>04A day of my holiday</title>
		<content> I get up in the morning and go to my  
 dad's room and read a story.  Then I  
 get into my clothes and go downstairs 
 and have breakfast.                   
 I went to find Pip, my dog, and I     
 went into the hayfield to play with   
 Pip.  Then I played with my Tonka     
 tractor until 1 o'clock and then I had
 my dinner.  I opened the gate for my  
 Dad then I have a go on my tractor.   
 I have had the tractor for about one  
 year.  I think it is German, it has an
 8 hp petrol engine.  Although my      
 tractor is painted blue at the moment 
 I shall probably change it to green   
 because my favourite tractors,        
 Magirus, are green.                   
 I use it mainly on our small farm,    
 especially for breaking up the surface
 of the soil and getting the weeds out.
