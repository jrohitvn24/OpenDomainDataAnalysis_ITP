		<title>07WESTBURY WHITE HORSE</title>
		<content>   Amongst the most familiar landmarks 
 in Wiltshire are the White Horses cut 
 into the chalk of the downland slopes.
   Of these, the Westbury White Horse, 
 the most southerly example, is perhaps
 the best known and certainly the best 
 sited, about two miles from Westbury  
 on Bratton Down immediately below the 
 ramparts of the Iron Age hillfort     
 known as Bratton Castle. Its position 
 commands a magnificient prospect of   
 Pewsey Vale.  The Westbury horse is   
 the oldest of the Wiltshire horses and
 dates from 1779 but it is also the    
 second of its line, having been       
 preceded on the same site by an older 
 horse of uncertain age and origin.    
 Local tradition holds that it was cut 
 to commemorate one of King Alfred's   
 victories over the Danes in A.D.878,  
 but this cannot be proved.
