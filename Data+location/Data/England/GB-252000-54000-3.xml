		<title>03An Interview With the Vicar</title>
		<content>  We interviewed the{Reverend  Thomas} 
 and we asked him some questions about 
 old people's homes in Plympton.       
{ St Elizbeths}home is for old people  
 who can move about and are not bed    
 ridden. There are 25 residents and    
 25 rooms in St Elizabeths. At St      
 Elizbeths they have their own         
 vegetable garden.                     
  When people get too ill they         
 go to {St Vincents}nursing home. At St
 Vincents sisters, matrons and nurses  
 look after the sick people. The old   
 people at St Vincents are bedridden   
 and they're not allowed out of thier  
 room. St Vincents has 24 patients     
 and 24 rooms.
