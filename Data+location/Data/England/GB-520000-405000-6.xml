		<title>06Penny Day</title>
		<content> Laceby School is unique in that every 
 year a Penny Day is held at St        
 Margarets church to celebrate the     
 rememberance of Philip and Sarah      
 Stanford.Sarah died in 1730 and in her
 will she left a sum of money which    
 was to be used for the education of   
 the poor children of the village and  
 was not to be used for any other      
 purpose.Every year the children would 
 receive a penny on the condition that 
 they went to church to receive it.    
 This year we went to church and first 
 we sang some hymns and then said some 
 prayers.Then the vicar gave a speech  
 about Jesus,followed by a reading from
 the bible.Some people did the part of 
 acting the King and the Fool.         
 The fund is still very active and     
 today every child receives 5p.
