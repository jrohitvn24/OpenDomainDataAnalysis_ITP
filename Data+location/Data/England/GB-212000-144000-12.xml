		<title>12Water Supply /Sewage System.</title>
		<content> Two herringbone drain systems lie     
 under the surface by the Cattle       
 Shelter and by the Quarters.Water is  
 pumped from these field drains to     
 tanks at the north  of the village    
 and pumped on to the houses.At        
 present the water is not treated and  
 is somewhat brown - with a peaty      
 taste.A water treatment plant will    
 probably be installed in the future.  
 There are filters in all the houses   
 but most residents drink the water    
 unfiltered and seem to suffer no ill  
 effects.Only Tibbets is not on the    
 system and it manages on roof water.  
 Water can run low in dry spells and   
 visitors are then asked to use water  
 sparingly.                            
 Sewage runs to a digesting system at  
 the bottom of Milcombe Valley.
