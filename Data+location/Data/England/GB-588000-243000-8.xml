Also in Waldingfield there is a place  
to buy local produce.There is a garage 
and a car sales shop.The public house  
in Waldingfield is called The White    
Horse and the one in Acton is called   
The Crown.                             
  We carried out a shopping survey     
involving the people to find their     
weekly shopping habits.25 out of 34 use
the village shops at least three times 
a week,and 8 people use the shops less 
than 8 times a week.                   
  Most people use Sudbury to do their  
weekly shopping.One person uses        
Waldingfield and another Colchester for
their weekly shopping.
