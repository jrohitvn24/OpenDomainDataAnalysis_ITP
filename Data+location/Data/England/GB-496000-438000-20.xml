		<title>20BISHOP BURTON MOBILE SHOPS</title>
		<content> Bishop Burton is a small village which
 cannot support many shops or services.
 Many prefer the choice of the bigger  
 towns such as Hull, Beverley and York.
 But some people without cars and old  
 age pensioners find it difficult to   
 travel far for shopping and it is     
 these people who find the mobile      
 services coming to the village so     
 important. A{mobile library}comes     
 every second Friday.  A{butcher}visits
 twice a week and there is a mobile    
{baker, coalman and fishmonger.        
                                       
                                       
                                       
 The group which researched and wrote  
 this information was made up of{staff 
{and students at Bishop Burton College
