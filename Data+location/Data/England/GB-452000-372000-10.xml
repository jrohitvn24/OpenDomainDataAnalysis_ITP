		<content> The 5th Duke of Portland was          
 responsible for the building of forty 
 or fifty lodges to cover all the roads
 into Welbeck Abbey. These lodges are  
 large, ornate, stone houses built in  
 the Neo-Tudor style. They provide     
 accommodation for Welbeck Estates     
 workers.                              
 High Holbeck was also built to provide
 housing for the employees of the      
 Welbeck Estates Company. The large    
 semi-detached houses are built in a   
 square around a central green and     
 recreation area.                      
 Much of the rest of the housing in    
 this area consists of stone cottages  
 and farms. Some have an interesting   
 mixture of stone and brickwork.
