		<content> Most houses and buildings in the area 
 used to belong to individual farmers  
 and their employees,but changes are   
 occuring.A farmer may now own more    
 than one farm (3 farms in Kynnersley  
 are owned by one farmer).Usually the  
 farms are still run as independent    
 units,but unwanted farm houses may be 
 sold or left empty,in some cases farm 
 buildings have been left to become    
 derelict,the centre of Kynnersley now 
 has two nearly derelict farm yards.One
 farmer lives in a neighbouring village
 on another of his farms.              
  Modern farming trends using larger   
 machinery(and more arable farming at  
 the expense of stock rearing)mean     
 fewer men are employed on farms.      
  Unwanted farm labourers cottages have
 been sold to people who wish to live  
 in the country but have to reach their
 employment by commuting.              </content>
