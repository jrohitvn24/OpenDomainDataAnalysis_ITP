		<title>07Barkestone cereal farming</title>
		<content>  Cereal farming is growing crops.The  
 crops are rye wheat barley  and oil   
 seed rape.The seed is sown by         
 tractors.Then it is left and then     
 fertiliser is put on it.Then it       
 is sprayed then after it is grown you 
 combine it.Then the ground  is        
 ploughed ready for the next.The       
 fertiliser is spread with a spinner   
 on the back of a tractor.One farmer   
 would drive the combine and another   
 man would go along beside on a        
 tractor and trailer collecting the    
 grain.The grain is then stored in     
 corn bins or barns .Then lorries come 
 to collect it.Then it is taken to     
 Immingham to be loaded on to ships for
 export.Some small fields  have been   
 made bigger by pulling up the hedges  
 because the farm machinery is made    
 much bigger.
