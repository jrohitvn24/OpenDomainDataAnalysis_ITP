		<title>18Money systems in Willenhall</title>
		<content> Since 1971 there has been a decimal   
 system of currency.100 pence equals   
 one pound.Coins represented the       
 following denominations: one half     
 penny,1 penny,2 pence,5 pence,10 pence
 and 50 pence.Paper notes represented  
 1 pound(Â£),Â£5,Â£10,Â£20 and Â£50.Later a 
 20 pence coin was introduced and in   
 1985 the half penny coin has been     
 taken out of circulation and a Â£1 coin
 has been brought in.This is due to    
 inflation which is currently 7%.Here  
 is an example of some prices in       
 Willenhall.An average weekly wage is  
 about Â£100.
