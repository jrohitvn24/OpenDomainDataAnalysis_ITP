		<title>02THE CATHEDRAL, LINCOLN.</title>
		<content> The {Normans }started  building  the  
 Cathedral in{1072.}A fire and an earth
 -quake  destroyed  most  of the Norman
 structure  and  it  was rebuilt by{St.
{Hugh  1186-1200.}In {1311}the {central
{tower}was completed  and is reputed to
 be the highest point heading eastwards
 until the {Ural Mountains}are reached.
 The Cathedral provides worship, drama,
 music  and  exhibitions throughout the
 year. Visitors  come to see to see the
 architecture,  especially  the  Norman
{West Front, }and the two stained glass
 windows - the{" Dean's  Eye "}and  the
{"Bishop's Eye".}The{ Wren }Library and
 the {Treasury }contain  many valuables
 including  one  of the  four  original
 copies  of  the {Magna  Carta.}On most
 nights  of the  year the  Cathedral is
{floodlit.}If you look carefully inside
 you may find the{Lincoln Imp.
