		<content>{Ashdon}County Primary School was      
 opened on the 30th September 1878     
 ultimately replacing the National     
 School which had opened its doors in  
 1853 and now stands empty at the top  
 of Church Hill.The number of pupils on
 roll has  varied between 35 on the    
 opening day to 135 pupils in 1906.For 
 the last 7 or 8 years the number of   
 classes have been 3 and the number of 
 pupils on roll has consistently been  
 between 60 and 70.In 1972 the old     
 Victorian premises were extended and  
 extensively modernised.Two open_plan  
 infant classrooms and a quiet room    
 were added to the 2 existing ones.An  
 assembly hall with separate dining    
 area and modern kitchen was also      
 included in the new development.The   
 school caters for children between the
 ages of 5 and 11 years and serves the 
 2 parishes of Ashdon and Hadstock.    </content>
