    When it was first opened in 1967   
 the 7 classroom school was called St. 
 Joseph's Old Hall Road, and even      
 though the two buildings were 0.5 of a
 mile apart, St.Joseph's Hope Road and 
 St. Joseph's Old Hall Road shared the 
 same head teacher, Mr.J.Cook.         
    St.Joseph's Old Hall Road was soon 
 seen to be a convenient meeting point 
 for parishoners from the West Side of 
 the parish, and so in December 1968,  
 Sunday masses were started in the     
 school. These Sunday Masses became so 
 popular that over 500 people attended 
 them each week.                       
    In August 1975 the parish of Holy  
 Family,Sale Moor was founded. Earlier 
 that year, the house at 65, Old Hall  
 Road was bought.
