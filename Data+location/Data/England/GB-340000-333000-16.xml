		<title>16The Post Office</title>
		<content>   The Post Office building is about   
 200 years old. The Post Office used to
 be a house. Before this the Post      
 Office was at the house next to the   
 shop and before that the Post Office  
 was at Lion Cottage. There is one     
 person who works in the Post Office,  
 that is Mrs Cross.                    
   It opens at 9 am till 12.30 pm,then 
 1.30 pm to 5.30 pm. Half day is on    
 Wednesdays till 12.30 pm. Thursday is 
 the busiest day of the week because it
 is pensions day.                      
   If there was no Post Office in      
 Welshampton people would need to go to
 Ellesmere but there is no bus service 
 to Ellesmere on Thursdays. There has  
 been a Post Office in Welshampton for 
 131 years.
