		<content> The big majority of the villagers are 
 either retired or comute to work in   
 Newton Abbot, Torbay or Totnes.       
 A number of owners of older picturesqe
 houses offer Bed and Breakfast to     
 attract holidaymakers to the village. 
 There are four farms within the       
 village, two dairy, one stock and one 
 arable, all of them small family run  
 businesses. The only industrial       
 business is a plant hire and trailer  
 manufacturing concern with repair     
 facilities for commercial vehicles. As
 an example of the old buildings,  Well
 House was built in about 1780 probably
 from locally quarried stone. It was   
 once the Manor House and was named    
 after three wells in its grounds, two 
 of which are known. Now a part-time   
 smallholding with poultry and exotic  
 pets it was once a village cider      
 works.                                </content>
