		<title>06FARMING:            QUINTON</title>
		<content>   The number of separate farms is now 
 significantly reduced in the area.    
 Many of the{tenancies}have been       
 absorbed into larger-scale operations.
   Magdalen College, Oxford continues  
 to be a major local{landowner.        
   There is one mainly dairy farm, one 
 wholly sheep farm and two wholly      
 arable farms. The remainder are       
 combinations of beef, sheep and arable
 farms.                                
   Increased{mechanisation}has reduced 
 the numbers of workers on the land to 
 a handful, who tend to work           
 co'operatively when the need arises.  
   Farm{produce}includes barley,wheat, 
 oats, oilseed rape, and potatoes. Much
 farm machinery is sold,repaired and   
 serviced in the village garage. Stock 
 and produce is sold in Stratford or   
 Banbury market. There is some market  
 gardening in the area.{               </content>
