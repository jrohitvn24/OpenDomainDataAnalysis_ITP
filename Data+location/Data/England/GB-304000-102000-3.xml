		<title>03BUILDINGS IN PLYMTREE</title>
		<content> Plymtree is a small village with about
 one hundred buildings ranging from cob
 houses to new estates.  It is in the  
 shape of a triangle.  As you enter the
 village from the East there is the    
 Victorian School House and School.    
 Opposite the School there is the first
 Estate which is of bungalows.  As you 
 go further down the road you come to  
 the centre of the village where there 
 is the second estate of detached      
 houses still under construction.  This
 estate is situated between the older  
 cob buildings that follow the road to 
 the Public House, Shop and Church.    
 Further in-filling of new detached    
 properties forms a prominent feature  
 of the heart of the village.  To the  
 NNE is ribbon development of newish   
 houses, a council estate of 12 semi   
 detached houses and the Chapel.
