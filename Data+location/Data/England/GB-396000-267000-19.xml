 I wake up to my alarm clock having a  
 mad fit,I hit the stupid thing it flys
 off the desk and hits the floor with  
 a thud.Oh no it's Thursday I wish I   
 didn't have to go to school,I'm so    
 tired Istagger out of bed  and drag   
 myself to the sink to wash.Then I     
 dress and leap down the stairs and    
 sprint into the kitchen.After I eaten 
 my toast Emma Bills calls for me.Then 
 we walk to school together.First      
 lesson is English,one dead good hour  
 of English.Today we did work for a    
 newspaper.Becky Husband and I did made
 up horoscopes.After a very boring     
 break we had an hour of E.S but today 
 it was not as good as it usually is.  
  At lunch there was a mad rush to get 
 into the dinner hall because it was   
 the Christmas lunch.Lucky I had       
 sandwiches.                           </content>
