		<content> The people of this area of the North  
 York Moors are very good at creating  
 their own entertainment and           
 recreation.                           
 There is no public cinema, public     
 house or club and dance hall.         
 The only building for entertainment   
 outside of the home is the village    
 hall. The villagers hold most of their
 dances, whist drives and other        
 recreational activities in this hall. 
 For other recreational activities     
 people travel to the neighbouring     
 villages of Sleights, Ruswarp, Sneaton
 and to Whitby and Scrborough.         
 The farmers main recreation is        
 shooting and conservation, many of    
 them belonging to a syndicate which   
 puts down many birds each year and    
 helps with the conservation and       
 environment. Youngers people tend to  
 be members of the Young Farmers Clubs.</content>
