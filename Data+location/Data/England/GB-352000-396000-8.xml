		<content> The{oldest}houses (1880-1900) are     
 along West End Road and Clipsley Lane,
 then Blackbrook Road (c 1900). Between
 the wars new houses appeared at       
 Woodlands Road, Carr Mill (on         
 Litherland Farm), and round Grosvenor 
 Road. About 1950 a new{Council estate}
 (at Glade Hill Farm), and the estate  
 west of Carr Mill Dam were built.     
 Since 1960 there has been much        
 in-filling, and the creation of large 
 estates at Legh Road, Chain Lane, west
 of Haydock Lane and at Grange Valley. 
 All the houses are{brick-built,}though
 the older ones have{slate roofs.}Only 
 the Glade Hill Farm estate is wholly  
 cement-rendered. The oldest houses are
 still being{modernised}(e.g. new gable
 ends, windows,etc), and in the Legh   
 Road estate more than 60% have been   
 altered or extended (new porches,     
 windows, garages or extensions).      </content>
