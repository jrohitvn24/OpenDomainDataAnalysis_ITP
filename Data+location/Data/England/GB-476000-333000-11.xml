		<content> There is a school at Barkestone that  
 was built in 1812.Children            
 from Plungar and Barkestone go to.It  
 starts at 9 o'clock and it ends at    
 quarter past three.At school Mrs Hills
 our teacher has a timetable which we  
 have to stick to.My favourite subject 
 is maths and I like stories. There is 
 also a school at Redmile that Redmile 
 children go to.At Barkestone children 
 start school when they are four years 
 old  and leave at ten years. We have  
 dinners that come from Bottesford     
 primary school but if you don't want  
 dinners you can have sandwiches. At   
 half past ten we have a playtime.This 
 goes on til1 quarter to eleven then we
 have another one at twelve            
 o'clocktill quarter past one. Every   
 year we have sports day and go on     
 school outings. On Monday morning we  
 have swimming and tennis on Wednesday.</content>
