		<title>151984-1985 At Ben Jonson</title>
		<content>This year I enjoyed alot of things in  
and out of school,we went on lots of   
outings.During our project on World War
2 we visited the Imperial War Museum,I 
liked drawing the gas masks best.We    
also did a project about emergency     
services and we called it 999.We did   
lots of work on the police,fire brigade
and ambulancemen but I really enjoyed  
drawing the policemen on horseback.We  
also entered a Panda Competition which 
my friends Claire and Shapna won.We    
also studied King Harold,went up to    
Hastings to see the Hastings Embroidery
and St.Clement's Caves.I liked writing 
poetry about Harold and William.Some of
the boys made very good tapestries.I   
will miss Ben Jonson when I go on to   
secondary school.
