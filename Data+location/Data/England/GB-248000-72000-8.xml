		<title>08Employment in Tavistock</title>
		<content>     Tavistock is a historical, rural, 
{ market town.}It is now a residential 
 area on the edge of Dartmoor. However,
 in the early 19th century  Tavistock  
 was a busy industrial{stannary town}  
 due to the copper, tin and arsenic    
{ mining industry}in Devon &amp; Cornwall. 
     Tavistock has very{little}industry
 and those it has are very small and   
 therefore employ very few people. This
 is because it has no major roads or   
 railways. The majority of people      
 working in Tavistock are employed in  
 service industries.{Many residents    
{have to travel out of Tavistock to    
{work.}                                
     Many people think that the job    
 situation in Tavistock is poor, but   
 others do not agree with more industry
 because they believe it would spoil   
 the environment and change the        
 atmosphere of the town.               </content>
