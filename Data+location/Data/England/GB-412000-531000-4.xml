 the top of{Hargill Hill.}On it she has
 6 horses. Her oldest horse is 21 and  
 her youngest is 1. There are no foals.
 The horses eat quite alot of things   
 like{hay, grass, bran, oats, pony     
{cubes, chaff, salt or minerals.}The   
 horses like all of their food. Miss   
 Wakefield has 7 fields, she sometimes 
 gives show jumping lessons. Of all her
 horses the highest one is 16 hands 2. 
 There are no stable boys or girls but 
 there are 2 helpers. Miss Wakefield   
 sometimes enjoys polishing the tack   
 but she doesn't like mucking the      
 stables out. She sometimes gets her   
 horses broken in.{A horse costs Â£600 a
{year to feed ; about Â£20 a week.      
 She doesn't sell riding gear. There's 
 a lot of lorries and vans in the      
 drive.                                </content>
