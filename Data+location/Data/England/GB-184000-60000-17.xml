		<content> We interviewed Mr Adams,owner of      
 Chapel Dairies.He also owns 360 acres 
 of land,220 cows,2 bulls,100 young    
 cattle(aged 6_9 months)and 40 calves. 
 His machinery includes 7 tractors,    
 several trailors and 12 milk floats,  
 of which 3 are petrol driven and 9 use
 battery power.These floats have been  
 in use from 1 to 10 years.The dairy   
 was built in 1859 and was taken over  
 by Mr Adams in 1959, who has now lived
 there for 26 years. It employs 18     
 people and produces 6000 bottles of   
 milk per day to be distributed in the 
 Newquay area.The old part of the dairy
 is built from elvan stone and the     
 newer section from steel.             
 Near Quintrell Downs crossroads we    
 discovered some large oil storage     
 tanks which can hold 1100 gallons.6   
 tankers come in daily to collect and  
 deliver oil.                          </content>
