		<title>16MOSSLEY MARKET</title>
		<content>     The market is held every Thursday,
 with a smaller market on Saturday, on 
 the {Market Ground }on Stamford St.,  
 Top Mossley. It has been held in its  
 present form for fourteen years.      
     There is a great variety of stalls
 selling everything from food to       
 furniture,household goods to clothing.
 About half of the stalls sell clothes,
 some specialise in one type of        
 clothing, such as childrens, whilst   
 others are more general.              
     Only two stallholders have        
 attended the market since it began.   
 Most have been coming for less than   
 five years.                           
     Most customers think the market is
 a good one with plenty of variety. The
 busiest times are lunchtime and late  
 afternoon. Saturday is quiet as most  
 traders then have stalls on           
 Ashton-U-Lyne market.                 </content>
