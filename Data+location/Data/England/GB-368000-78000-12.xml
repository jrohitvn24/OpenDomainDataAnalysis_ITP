		<title>12The Nothe Area.</title>
		<content> In the last year{Weymouth and District
{Borough Council}have been trying to   
 make the{Nothe}a more interesting     
 place.For instance,they have put more 
 flowers and bushes there,also more    
 paths and fences so you don't have to 
 scramble up the grassy bank.The{Civic 
{Society}is responsible for the        
 restoration work that is being done on
 the{Nothe Fort.                       
  The{Waterfall near Stone}Pier,is to  
 commemorate the{Royal Wedding of      
{Prince Charles to Lady Diana.         
  Instead of a big carpark on the Nothe
 there are parking bays which are      
 almost hidden out of sight.The new    
 Toilets are cleaner and better than   
 the old ones.There are benches and    
{picnic tables}so you can look over the
{harbour}while eating your lunch.There 
 are also areas for having{barbecues.
