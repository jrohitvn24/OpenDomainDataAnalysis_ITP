		<content> Most of the heavy industry such as    
{cotton weaving, coal mining and metal 
{manufacturing}has moved away from this
 area,leaving the town with roughly    
 three small industrial estates,Lockett
 road,Camp road, and Park lane.These   
 are mainly storage and distribution   
 depots.The only manufacturing carried 
 out on a large scale is at,           
 G.K.N.,Levertons,and Makerfield       
 Springs.A small clothing manufacturer 
 operates on Bolton road.The industrial
 development of the Three Sisters' area
 includes warehousing for Kwik-Save as 
 well as Ro-Mix,a ready made cake      
 firm.There are one or two other small 
 manufacturing firms there.There are   
 several scrap merchants and two wood  
 yards.Most of the people of Ashton    
 work in other towns which are within  
 travelling distance.Ashton has        
 therefore become a residential town.  </content>
