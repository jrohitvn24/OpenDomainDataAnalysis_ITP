		<title>15Lighthouses And Lightships</title>
		<content>In 1669 Sir John Clayton sought        
permission to build a lighthouse at    
Corton and the light, a coal burning   
beacon atop what was described as the  
most curious lighthouse in Christendom,
was first kindled on 22nd. September   
1675.Mainly because of opposition from 
Trinity House, Clayton could not make  
his lighthouse pay and it was          
extinguished in 1679.Between 1864 and  
1871 two wooden lighthouses stood on   
Corton cliffs towards Hopton to guide  
ships through the sandbanks.A lightship
was first stationed four miles offshore
in 1863;it was replaced by an automatic
navigation buoy in 1968.
