 witchcraft but reverted to her former 
 ways later on. Once again she wandered
 the area and while playing at{Cliviger
{Mill}in the guise of a cat the        
 miller's man cut off one of her paws. 
 She managed to return home and had to 
 face the anger of{Lord William}to whom
 the missing hand with its costly      
 signet ring had been brought from

 from the powers of darkness she died  
 in peace.{Bernshaw Tower,}her former  
 home, was left un-tenanted but for    
 many years it was reported that on{All
