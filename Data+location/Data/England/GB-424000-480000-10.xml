		<title>10Visiting Well &amp; Nosterfield</title>
		<content> Although near main roads Well is not  
 on a direct route to the Dales and is 
 often missed unless there is a        
 specific purpose in coming. Visitors  
 still seek the Roman villa, producing 
 a map to locate it,but the remains are
 buried and a modern bungalow covers   
 the site.A fragment of mosaic pavement
 is displayed in the church which is   
 well worth a visit.It has a Norman    
 south porch and the typical Neville   
 square topped windows in the south    
 wall and medieval stained glass       
 family arms in an east window.The     
 carved wooden font cover is said to be
 the second oldest in Britain, 1352,   
 graffiti dated 1618 on a tomb.        
 Two homes offer bed and breakfast,and 
 the Well Ox is non-residential.Noster-
 field on the B6267 is better placed   
 and meals are served at the           
 Freemason's Arms.                     </content>
