		<title>06Contrasts on Grimsby's Edge.</title>
		<content> Squares 1,5,and 9 in our block offer  
 great contrast in their land cover and
 amenities. Square 9 is covered with   
{arable farmland and woods.}Square 5 is
 also mostly{arable farmland,}but there
 is an unspoilt village,{Bradley,}which
 is situated on the borders of two     
 administrative areas,{Grimsby,}and    
{Cleethorpes and District.}Square 1 is 
 mostly{residential}with a large area  
 set aside as an{Urban Recreational    
 open space.{Transport}is part of the  
 count because of the many small roads.
 Most of the amenities are centred on  
{Bradley Cross Roads}which is situated 
 at the junction of the{A l8}and an    
 unofficial ring road. Around the      
 junction are two{garages,}various     
{shops,}a sub{post office}and a{public 
{house.}About{70%}of the population of 
 the three squares is close to this    
 road junction.{                       </content>
