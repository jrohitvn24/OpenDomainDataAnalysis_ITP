		<content>  A large proportion of villagers are  
 pensioners including a number over 8O 
 years of age. Most are able to reside 
 and maintain their own homes whilst   
 some receive care from neighbours,    
 health officials, home helps and      
 church members. Handicapped children  
 and young people needing special      
 training are taken daily to the Holt  
 Training Centre.                      
 A Doctor's surgery is held weekly at  
 Ham House for those preferring not to 
 make the journey to nearby towns.     
 Surgery provides consultation and     
 medicines.

 port to hospital, dentist, optician,  
 etc.

 old peoples homes, hospitals, etc.
