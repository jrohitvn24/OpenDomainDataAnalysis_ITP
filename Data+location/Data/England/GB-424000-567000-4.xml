		<title>04JESMOND DENE - PART ONE</title>
		<content> The Dene was designed and owned by    
 Lord Armstrong.                       
                                       
 Armstrong Bridge is a big feature of  
 the Dene. Unfortunately the bridge is 
 too weak and dangerous for traffic use
 but an Arts and Crafts market is held 
 on Sundays on the bridge.             
                                       
 On a sunny day people will flock to   
 the Dene to enjoy the weather. There  
 are many birds and animals using the  
 Dene as their home. Pets' Corner has a
 number of animals in it for the people
 to look at.                           
                                       
 The Ouseburn runs through the Dene    
 from which an old mill harnessed its  
 energy. Today the mill is disused and 
 forms another tourist attraction.
