		<title>15A SURVEY</title>
		<content> A survey was carried out in Bisley by 
 means of a questionaire which was     
 enclosed in every household'sfree copy
 of the Bisley News.  Forty replies    
 were received. From them we discovered
 that the majority of people who live  
 in Bisley work outside the village and
 travel to work by car.  Also that most
 people do the most of their shopping  
 in the large towns nearby.            
 Leisure time activities are very      
 varied and include sailing, horse-    
 riding, shooting,badminton,photography
 threatre visits, choral music, wine   
 making, cycling, walking, gardening,  
 bellringing, painting, rugby, fishing,
 squash, swimming and craftwork.Several
 of the people who returned the        
 questionaire can trace their families 
 back in Bisley for several generations
 The most is five generations all of   
 whom went to the village school.      </content>
