		<title>05THE CHANGING VILLAGE</title>
		<content> We have been interviewing people who  
 have been living in the village on    
 average 53 years. 60% of the people we
 interviewed went to the school in the 
 village. One of the changes of the    
 school in the village, is there used  
 to be 210 children, 7 teachers and 7  
 classes, now there are 89 children, 6 
 teachers (3 part time) and 4 classes. 
 We wear red and white school uniform, 
 they wore white dainty frocks.        
 The main changes in the village are   
 houses, shopping and roads. 75% of the
 people we interviewed liked the       
 changes. Everybody agreed the changes 
 are for the better. However nobody    
 liked the idea of making Binfield     
 bigger. 99% thought we should have a  
 new school. Everybody thought there   
 should be more places for  senior     
 citizens. What people like best about 
 the village is the country walks.     </content>
