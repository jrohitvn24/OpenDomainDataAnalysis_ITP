		<title>19REDDISH IN THE PAST</title>
		<content> In the past there were very few       
 streets in Reddish;most of the land   
 was covered in fields.There were many 
 mills;Gregs ,Nickson and              
 Houldsworth.There was Nelstrop7s flour
 mill ,Scott's wire works and the      
 chemical works.At the back of the     
 mills were warm ponds where people    
 went swimming(the machinery heated the
 water).A canal ran through Reddish    
 which led to Manchester Docks.        
 Itwas apoor area where agreat deal    
 ofpeople hadto work ta jobs which     
 could cause illness or even death.    
 In school there were strict rules if  
 you didn't obey them you would get the
 cane.                                 
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
