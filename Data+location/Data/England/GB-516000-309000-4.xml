		<content>    Some of the sewage doesn't go      
 through these beds but goes to the    
 more modern activated sludge plant.   
    At the end of the treatment cycle  
 the purified water is pumped into the 
 river Welland and this in turn will   
 reach the sea.                        
    The sludge which is left is kept in
 tanks and after the harvests,the East 
 Anglian Water Board tankers take it to
 our local farmers.This is a free      
 service, the sludge is an ideal soil  
 conditioner and improves the farmers  
 land.                                 
    Originally the sludge was left to  
 dry out on grit beds and was dug out  
 as a solid cake.These old grit beds   
 are still there,although they are not 
 used any more.
