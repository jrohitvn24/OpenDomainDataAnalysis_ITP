		<title>15HOUSING AROUND WEELEY</title>
		<content>   In Weeley, there are many styles of 
 houses and buildings. In the{estate}  
 areas (where the majority of the      
 inhabitants are elderly people){      
{bungalows}are most frequent. Whereas  
 the houses outside the town are       
 larger, and older houses.             
   There is one house just outside{    
{Weeley}called{Kenilworth}which is     
 inhabited by a very wealthy man. This 
 house is very large and unlike the    
 majority of houses around Weeley,     
 fairly old. Also there are some houses
 which are very unusually built. In the
 actual town the majority of houses are
 semi-detatched.                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
