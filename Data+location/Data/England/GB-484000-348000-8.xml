		<title>08OLD BLACKSMITH IN CLAYPOLE</title>
		<content>                                       
      My great-grandad was a black-    
 smith. He began work about 1920. He   
 started down Barnby Lane and later on 
 Main Street in Claypole. He would shoe
 about 20 horses a day and also at the 
 surrounding villages of Stubton,      
 Brandon, Foston, Allington, Wellingore
 and Barnby Manor. In small shops he   
 would shoe local horses taking        
 his mobile Forge to heat the shoes    
 he had already made to fit horses     
 hooves. He also repaired and made     
 harrows and  other Agricultural       
 implements. He would reserve a day for
 hooping cart wheels as they had to be 
 heated to fit the wheels of the carts.
 He retired in 1970 and we have no     
 local blacksmith who shoes our horses 
 today.                                
       The next page tells about the   
 life of our present blacksmith.       </content>
