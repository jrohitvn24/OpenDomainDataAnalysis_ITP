		<content>  In Loughton about 7.5% of the people 
 go to church. There are different     
{churches}for peoples worship such as; 
 Church of England, Methodist, Catholic
 and there is also a synagogue. In     
 Loughton we have no mosques or        
 temples.                              
  The churches usually do something for
 a special time of year. At{harvest    
 they send food to old people's homes  
 such as Abbeyfields. Soon all the     
 churches will get together for a      
{mission}where they try to get more    
 people to go to church.               
  Attached to some churches like       
 St.Marys and St.Johns are{scout and   
{guide}troops. They attend church, go  
 to camp and do badges for different   
 skills. Some churches have youth      
 groups like 'Pathfinders' and 'Fysh   
 and chyps' who play games and listen  
 to bible stories.                     </content>
