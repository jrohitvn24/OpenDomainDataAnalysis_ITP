		<title>11Our School by Michael</title>
		<content> My school will be sixty years old next
 year. Before that there was an even   
 older school in Branton which was in  
 the building  just across the yard    
 from this school.                     
 This school has 28 children in it. It 
 is very friendly. We get quite a lot  
 of visitors especially at the 'Open   
 Assembly' which is held once a month. 
 There are two teachers and two        
 classes. We have a front playground, a
 back playground and a field. But we   
 can't go on the field just now        
 because the bulls and cows got in from
 the next door field and made a mess.  
 They also knocked the goal posts down.
 My favourite thing at this school is  
 practising my tables on the computer. 
 Right now I am on Mixed Tables. I also
 like P.E. on the apparatus. We have to
 do P.E. in the classroom because we do
 not have a school hall.               </content>
