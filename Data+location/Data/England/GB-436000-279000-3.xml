		<title>03WALSGRAVE AREA VILLAGE LIFE</title>
		<content> Walsgrave started off as a little     
 village.It had a school,a church and a
 few houses.The place itself is quiet  
 and clean.Nowadays there are lots of  
 modern houses and shops and a high    
 population.There are no buses around  
 the modern area of Walsgrave but two  
 buses go round the new hospital and   
 three pass the church.Traffic has     
 increased because there is a direct   
 route through Walsgrave to the        
 motorway.The old school was pulled    
 down and a new school has taken its   
 place across the road from the old    
 one.A big new superstore called Asda  
 was built in 1982 with everything from
 a spark plug to a dozen eggs.The air  
 in the area is clean,helping us to    
 keep healthy.This is because there are
 not many factories or places where    
 smoke comes out.
