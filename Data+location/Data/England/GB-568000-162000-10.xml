		<content>   The main industry in the Halling    
 area is Cement manufacturing which    
 involves quarrying and production.    
   The Romans were the first to use    
 cement.It was called lime-mortar.     
 Sometimes it crumbled,so stronger     
 cement was developed using clinker,   
 made by heating chalk and clay.The    
 cement industry grew in Kent because  
 clay was available from the river     
 estuaries and chalk from the North    
 Downs.                                
   In the 1890's people used cement to 
 cover the walls of their houses so it 
 looked as if they were made of        
 Portland stone,which cost too much    
 money.                                
   The development of Portland cement  
 and a building boom in the nineteenth 
 century meant led to great changes in 
 the area.
