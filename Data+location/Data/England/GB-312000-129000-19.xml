 THhe West Somerset Railway runs across
 the north-eastern corner of the block.
 The line passes close to the village  
 of  Combe Florey.                     
                                       
 The railway is a privately owned      
 company, open during the summer       
 months, linking Bishops Lydeard to    
 Minehead. It was hoped to extend the  
 service to Taunton but difficulties   
 have arisen in linking the line up to 
 the existing BR service in the County 
 town. At present, the line starts at  
 the Norton  Fitzwarren junction west  
 of Taunto and runs through Bishops    
 Lydeard, Crowcombe, Stogumber,        
 Williton, Watchet,Washford and        
 Dunster. The line terminates at       
 Minehead.
