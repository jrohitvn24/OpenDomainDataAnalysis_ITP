		<title>20THE VILLAGE NAME</title>
		<content> There are several theories about the  
 way our village got its name.  Maybe  
 it is a corruption of Audimer _ the   
 sound of the sea, or Outremer _ beyond
 the sea. But there is a legend which  
 offers a more interesting explanation.
 In the early days when building of the
 church was first begun, unwisely down 
 on the marshy land, the Angels took a 
 hand and saw to it that wiser counsels
 prevailed in the choice of a site on  
 higher ground.  The foundations laid  
 each day mysteriously disappeared each
 night.  The pussled parishioners sat  
 up to watch.  They were amazed to see 
 angels come and carry the stones      
 across the water to the church's      
 present site.  'O'er the mere, o'er   
 the mere' they sang as they worked. So
 of course the church, and the village,
 were built o'er the mere at Udimore,  
 or Udymer as the old spelling has it. </content>
