		<title>17Ecology of Yewdale 3</title>
		<content>    The{fox, badger, red squirrel,     
{brown hare, roe}and{red deer}are all  
 found in Yewdale, but recently there  
 have been unwelcome additions such as 
 the{mink.}Fortunately,{grey squirrels 
 have yet to penetrate into this area. 
    On the fells the{raven}and{buzzard 
 are still much in evidence, with the  
{meadow pipit}and{wheatear}amongst the 
 commonest of the smaller birds. The   
 woods attract the{pied flycatcher,    
{redstart, tree pipit}and{chiffchaff,  
 with young conifers a suitable habitat
 for{titmice}and{goldcrests.           
    Along the becks the{dipper}and{grey
{wagtail}flourish, with{yellow wagtails
 and{ducks}in the lower reaches. Many  
 of these waters contain{brown trout,  
 with the usual range of smaller fish, 
{minnows, bullheads}and{sticklebacks.  
 Some becks are devoid of life because 
 of pollution from copper mining.      </content>
