		<content> The survey shows that a variety       
 of fuel is used in the area.  Many of 
 the houses and farmhouses have solid  
 fuel stoves which burn either wood or 
 anthracite.  Many houses use oil as   
 well as coal and wood, only one person
 said she used calor gas and no one    
 heated the home with electricity.     
 There is an adequate supply of wood   
 logs in the area, many people cutting 
 down dead trees on their own property,
 while others buy logs from neighbours.
 Coal can be obtained from Bromyard or 
 from a haulier a few miles away who   
 delivers a small amount weekly or     
 larger quantities to order at any     
 time.
