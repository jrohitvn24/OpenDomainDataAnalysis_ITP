		<title>12STOTTESDON PARISH COUNCIL</title>
		<content> Stottesdon &amp; Sidbury Parish Council   
 has 10 members (3 women). It meets in 
 the school when the need arises,      
 usually 8 times a year.{Planning      
{applications}received through the     
 District Council are discussed, &amp;     
 recommendations made. Members also    
 bring{local concerns}(usually about   
 roads &amp; ditches, or illegally parked  
 caravans) to the meeting, &amp; seek      
 action from the County Council. The   
 council also seeks to encourage{local 
{initiatives,}and improve{amenities.   
 Grants are occasionally made to       
 support{local groups}&amp; also for the   
 maintainance of burial grounds. The   
{main concern}at the moment is to      
 arrest the decline in the community by
 preventing the school's closure,      
 supporting a new surgery, &amp; promoting 
 the building of small homes, while    
 conserving our heritage.              </content>
