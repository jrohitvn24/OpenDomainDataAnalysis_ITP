		<title>11THE TOM COBLEY.</title>
		<content>   The Tom Cobley Tavern got its name  
 from the character in the folk        
 song"Uncle Tom Cobley an' All"who     
 lived in these parts from 1762 to     
 1844.The Tom Cobley is a free house,so
 the owners can sell any brewery's beer
 and distiller's spirits.              
   This tavern was first licensed in   
 1589.The building is made of 60cm.wide
 walls of cob,stone and granite.The    
 tavern was thatched but the whole of  
 the first floor has now been built up 
 and it now has a slate roof.          
   When you go inside the tavern you   
 can see many unusual objects.There is 
 a bier wheel made into a light.Over   
 the door is a charred,carved oak panel
 from the original public house.The    
 main bar is part wood panelled and    
 there is a very old settle.It is      
 1.67m.high and 1.67m.wide.It was made 
 like this to keep out the draughts.   </content>
