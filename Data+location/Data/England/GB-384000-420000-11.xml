		<title>11FARMING AROUND STACKSTEADS</title>
		<content> My name is James Law and I live at    
 Mitchell Field Nook Farm. It is quite 
 a big farm for around here, but I     
 suppose it is quite small as farms go.
 We keep alot of pigs and some sheep.  
 We have a slaughterhouse in           
 Stacksteads where the pigs are sent to
 be butchered. Our type of farm is     
 called a hill farm, which is what they
 all are around here. The soil is not  
 suitable for growing crops and the    
 climate is not very good either. We   
 are quite high up too. Although there 
 are alot of farms, the men who live   
 there often have other jobs as well   
 because you cannot make enough from   
 farming alone. Many, like Michael     
 Bosworth's dad are haulage contractors
 and do odd jobs with their lorries.
