		<content>The Tubney Tree,a large dead elm,marks 
the boundary of Fyfield and Tubney.It  
is not known locally as the Fyfield    
Elm which is how Mathew Arnold         
immortalized it in his poetry.         
  Opposite are cottages on either side 
of  the road, a few sadly have modern  
extensions. Half way along the road is 
a an old V.R. post box still in use,   
actually set into its sidewall, Well   
cottage, the telephone box and notice  
board proclaiming a Mondays only bus   
service.Large houses hiding in secluded
gardens form the southern end of the   
village, bordered by Frilford Heath    
Golf Club.Opposite the notice board is 
a lodge by the gated front drive,lined 
with beautiful old trees leading to    
Tubney House,nicknamed Parsons Castle  
because the banker of that name built  
the balustrades.The back drive leads   
to St.Lawrence Church(Welby Pugin l847)</content>
