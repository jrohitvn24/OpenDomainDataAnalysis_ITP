		<content> CANK FARM HAS BEEN OCCUPIED BY THE    
 SAME FAMILY FOR OVER THIRTY YEARS IN  
 WHICH SEVERAL CHANGES HAVE BEEN MADE. 
 OF THE TWO MAJOR CHANGES, ONE MIGHT   
 SEE THAT OF THE CONVERSION FROM WELL -
 WATER, ACQUIRED BY A WINDMILL, TO THE 
 MAINS SUPPLY AS BEING PARTICULARLY    
 SIGNIFICANT. THIS HAS MEANT A STEADY  
 SUPPLY THROUGHOUT THE YEAR, EVEN IN   
 THE WINDLESS MONTH OF NOVEMBER.       
 ANOTHER MAJOR CHANGE UNDERTAKEN IN    
 1980 WAS THE CHANGEOVER FROM MILK COWS
 TO ARABLE FARMING. THIS WAS INITIATED 
 BY THE OFFER OF A GRANT OF A FIXED    
 AMOUNT PER HEAD OF CATTLE SLAUGHTERED 
 AS A MEANS OF REDUCING MILK PRODUCTION
 AT A TIME WHEN E.E.C. FARMERS WERE    
 OVER PRODUCING MILK AND UNDERPRODUCING
 CEREALS. THE MONEY SO GAINED WAS THEN 
 USED TO BUY MACHINERY NECESSARY FOR   
 CONVERTING THE ORIGINAL 100 ACRES OF  
 GRASS+100 ACRES ARABLE TO ALL ARABLE. </content>
