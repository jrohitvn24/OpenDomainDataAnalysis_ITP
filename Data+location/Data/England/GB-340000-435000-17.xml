		<title>17ONE DAY GREENHALGH/ROSEACRE</title>
		<content> A typical day in the life of an       
 average housewife is as follows. Rises
 at 7.15am, prepares breakfast for     
 husband and two schoolboy sons. After 
 clearing up the chaos left by the     
 above, leaves for work at 8.40. Cycles
 several miles to part-time work as a  
 basic education teacher at Kirkham    
 Open Prison. After pub lunch with     
 colleagues returns home. Spends       
 afternoon doing housework, gardening, 
 sewing, teaching preparation, or doing
 secretarial work for local WI. Spends 
 time with sons who return from schook 
 at 4pm and the family share a meal at 
 6pm. The evening may be spent at a    
 meeting of the WI, church womens'     
 group, sons' school PTFA, sons' scout 
 group executive, or Scottish Dancing  
 or relaxing at home.
