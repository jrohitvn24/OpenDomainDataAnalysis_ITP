		<content>   A study carried out by children at  
 Blackfield Middle School shows that   
 there is a wide variety of organised  
 clubs outside school hours available  
 for children in the 8 to 12 age range.
   In fact they listed 26 different    
 kinds of clubs, 60 in total, which    
 fell into four main groups. 1st{youth 
{clubs;}2nd clubs associated with the {
{scouting movement;}3rd clubs connected
 with some form of{sport;}and 4th{     
{others.} Children can choose from 6   
 youth clubs, 4 cub packs, 2 scout     
 troops, 3 brownie packs and 3 guide   
 companies.  Sporting clubs range from 
 Judo and Kung Fu to Football, Tennis  
 and Gymnastics.  Other types of club  
 include Drama, Ballet, a Wind Group,  
 Majorettes and a junior Naturalist    
 Club.  Most take place in the         
 community centres, church halls or    
 sports centres.                       </content>
