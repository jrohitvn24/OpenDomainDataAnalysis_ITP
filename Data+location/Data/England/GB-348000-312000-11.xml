		<title>11TRANSPORT IN SHREWSBURY.</title>
		<content> The train is a popular form of public 
 transport in Shrewsbury because the   
 railway lines lead out in five compass
 directions;North,Northwest,West,South 
 and East.When our class went by train 
 to Church Stretton, we were 15 minutes
 late starting because our train had to
 wait for a connection with another.   
 No. of trains dealt with per week-day.

 thought the bus station was suitably  
 placed in Barker Street but he did not
 like the one-way system in Shrewsbury.
 Country buses service the rural areas.
 Taxis,cars and cycles are also used.
