		<content>   At Christmas many people go round   
 the Villages Carol Singing.They       
 collect money for charity. A member of
 the Round Table Organisation dresses  
 up as Father Christmas and rides      
 around the Villages on a sleigh also  
 collecting money for charity.All the  
 children tell Santa what they would   
 like for Christmas and sometimes he   
 gives the little children a ride on   
 the sleigh.                           
   At school we have our own post box  
 in which we can post cards to each    
 other. The school has its own party   
 where we all wear funny hats and play 
 games like "Give Us A Clue" and       
 "hangman". We have a Christmas tea    
 followed by a magician or a Puppet    
 Show.                                 
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
