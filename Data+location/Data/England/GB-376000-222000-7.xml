		<title>07HARTPURY PARISH COUNCIL</title>
		<content> Seven people form Hartpury Parish     
 Council. They are elected by the      
 parishioners (aged 18 years and above)
 to be responsible for the affairs of  
 the community. They serve as the      
 interface between the District        
 Council and the people, representing  
 their views to the Authority. The     
 Parish Council has the declared       
 objective of retaining a rural        
 environment and supports the          
 Gloucestershire Structure Plan which  
 limits construction in the village to 
 25 dwellings in the next 15 years and 
 envisages the 'detrunking' of the     
 A417. The Parish Council is the       
 driving force behind Hartpury's       
 success in the Bledisloe Cup for the  
 best kept village and also for the    
 publication of a footpath booklet     
 detailing local walks.
