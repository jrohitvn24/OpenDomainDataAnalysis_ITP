		<content> There are very few persons now        
 resident in the Lea Parish that were  
 actually born in the parish itself.   
                                       
 There has been quite considerable     
 movement across the 7 parishes due to 
 either wanting to be close to the main
 source of employment: Rank Xerox at   
 Mitcheldean, Listers at Cinderford,   
 Dowty near Gloucester, Northern       
 Colliery near Cinderford or conversely
 not wanting to be close to the site of
 employment and sought the peaceful    
 retreat of the rural areas.           
                                       
 Many of the old cottages and barns    
 have been renovated either for the use
 of local inhabitants or for usage as  
 holiday homes by distant owners or    
 hired on a weekly or monthly basis.
