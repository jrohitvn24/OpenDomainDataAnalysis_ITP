  There is a fully-working windmill in 
 Sibsey, called the Sibsey Trader Mill.
 It was built in 1877 by Messrs.       
 Saunderson. It worked until the 1950s.
 It is built of brick and has only     
 recently been restored. The small     
 museum was opened this year. The mill 
 was the property of the Crawford      
 family but it now belongs to National 
 Heritage.   {The Windmill             
{       The windmill stood alone       
      { on the side of the bank.       
{       The white and black door       
{       swaying in the wind.           
      { The sails turning as the wind  
{       Gently blew the fantail round. 
{       The windows opened and shut.   
{       The poor old windmill          
{       Stood alone                    
{       On the side of the bank.
