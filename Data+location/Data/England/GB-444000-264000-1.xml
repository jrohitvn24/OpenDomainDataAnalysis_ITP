		<title>01BROADWELL-A GENERAL REVIEW</title>
		<content>This Block is a predominantly          
agricultural one.There is only one     
village,the village of Broadwell.There 
are 10 farms.The fields are mainly for 
grazing,although there is also some    
arable farming.                        
Broadwell itself dates back to Medieval
Times,although the oldest building is  
an Elizabethan barn.There are two      
Churches,neither of which are Church Of
England &lt;unusual for Warwickshire>.    
There is only one shop in the          
Block,which is a very small Sub-Post   
Office and general store,but there is  
also an agricultural supplier.The only 
source of entertainment is a very small
village hall,there are no public       
houses.Broadwell has a village green   
but this is not used.There are only two
buses a week,one being a free bus to   
Southam Market.The Well still exists   
but it is no longer in use.            </content>
