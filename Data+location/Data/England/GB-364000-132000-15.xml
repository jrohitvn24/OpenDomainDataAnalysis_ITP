		<title>15 CASTLE CARY IN 1086.</title>
		<content>     According to the Domesday Book,   
there was land in Cary for 20 ploughs. 
This probably means there was enough   
land for about 250-300 people,using    
in the region of 2000 acres for        
farming.In 1086 Castle Cary was a      
flourishing place,but not a borough.   
The King's commissioners recorded that 
it had belonged to a Saxon King called 
Elsi!There were three mills on the     
River Caty's banks and they were quite 
prosperous.The commissioners report    
that there 23 villeins and 5           
swineherds,the latter grazing their    
animals in the nearby forest.          
   In the 12th century Cary came into  
the possession of the Lovel family.It  
is not clear if the Lovels built the   
Castle or if the earlier Walter of     
Douai was responsible.The castle site  
was excavated in 1890.Nothing remains  
today and it is little known.          </content>
