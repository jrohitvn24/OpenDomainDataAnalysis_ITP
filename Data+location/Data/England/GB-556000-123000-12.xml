		<title>12PEOPLES' HOPES FOR THE AREA</title>
		<content> RESIDENTS OF THIS AREA HOPE TO        
 PRESERVE THE RURAL SETTING OF OPEN    
 FIELD, LITTLE COPSES AND ROLLING      
 HILLS, WHICH IS NATURAL AND UNSPOILT  
 IN ITS GREAT BEAUTY. IT IS ALSO A     
 SHELTER AND HOME FOR ABUNDANT         
 WILDLIFE. THE LOCAL VILLAGES WITH     
 GREAT CHARACTER AND CHARM, AND        
 NEIGHBOURING HISTORIC HOUSES SHOULD   
 ALL BE PROTECTED. FARMERS TOO, HOPE TO
 BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO FOLLOW THEIR   
 AGRICULTURAL PURSUITS WITHOUT         
 INTERFERENCE. WHILST THE RESIDENTS    
 HOPE TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE THE       
 TRADITIONAL WAYS OF VILLAGE AND       
 COUNTRY LIFE, THEY DO NOT WISH TO BE  
 EXCLUDED FROM PROGRESS IN SOME FORMS  
 AND BECOME AN ANACHRONISM. THEY HOPE  
 THERE CAN BE A BALANCE BETWEEN MODERN 
 CONVENIENCE, HISTORY, TRADITION AND   
 NATURAL BEAUTY.                       
                                       </content>
