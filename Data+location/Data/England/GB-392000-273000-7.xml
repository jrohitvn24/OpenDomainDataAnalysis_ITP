		<content> At thye sand quarry the sand is not   
 hard. There are different kinds of    
 sands. One is called red sand,        
 blinding sand is white with stones in.
 There is big machinery to scoop the   
 sand out with. When they have had the 
 sand put in the lorry they go up to   
 the weighbridge and weigh their       
 lorries. If there is not enough in    
 them they go and get some more. The   
 cliff was about 70 feet high. On the  
 pond there were two Canadian Geese    
 with their goslings. At the sand      
 quarry there are foxes, rabbits, grass
 snakes and many butterflies and birds.
 The red sand is used for making moulds
 at iron foundries, the building sand  
 is used for making cement.
