		<title>12The Town Dump</title>
		<content>                                       
While we were surveying our D-block, we
passed a disused quarry. Nowadays it is
used for waste disposal. All the       
rubbish from Witney and other towns is 
taken here and it is dumped. The pits  
are then covered over. Unfortunately,  
the dump is now full and another will  
have to be found. When I was at North  
Leigh I visited the quarry and it was  
full to the top. There was a great,    
big, yellow, mechanical digger and it  
cruched a washing machine and it was   
flattened first time. If you drop      
rubbish around the quarry you will be  
fined four pounds. It is closing at the
end of this month (June 1985) and the  
dump is moving to Stanton Harcourt. The
quarry will turn into a field in time.
