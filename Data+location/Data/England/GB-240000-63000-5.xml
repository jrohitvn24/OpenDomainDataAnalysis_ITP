		<title>05Tamar Valley _ Recreation</title>
		<content> The offering for{tourism}in this area 
 is the pleasure taken in sailing on   
 the River, walking along the valley or
 staying in charming{holiday}cottages. 
 Many types of boats have moorings at  
 Weir Quay and steamers ply through    
 with their human cargo to the upper   
 reaches. Birdwatching is a popular    
 pastime where rare species are often  
 spotted along the mud-banks or amongst
 the hedgerows.{Recreation}tends not to
 be commercialsed but is rather of the 
 individuals making. It is possible to 
 appreciate nature and on occasions    
 'hear' the silence of the countryside.
{Leisure}time is spent in a variety of 
 ways, a firm favourite is going for a 
 stroll when one can study closely the 
 flora, fauna and well kept gardens.   
 Any observer, artist or photographer  
 cannot fail to be inspired by the     
 wealth of natural and unspoilt beauty.</content>
