		<title>16Swimming in Fremington</title>
		<content>   Lots of people in Fremington enjoy  
 going swimming. Most people in        
 Fremington go to Barnstaple leisure   
 centre. In summer the children can    
 use the school swimming pool.People   
 also go swimming in the sea at Instow 
 three miles away.People cant swim in  
 the estuary near by because there is  
 too much pollution from the abbatoir. 
 Most people learn to swim  at school. 
 They get their first lesson in the    
 reception. The children go swimming   
 everyday throughout the  summer.The   
 pool is 12 metres long and 5 metres   
 in width and 75cm deep. It is not     
 really big enough but it is still     
 enjoyable and a very useful place.The 
 older children in the Winter go       
 swimming at the leisure centre. Where 
 the extra size and depth allows to    
 practice there  strokes diving        
 and lifesaving.                       </content>
