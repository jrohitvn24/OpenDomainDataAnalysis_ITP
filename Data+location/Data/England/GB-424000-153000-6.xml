 There was a ruined Saxon church here  
 when the Domesday Survey was made in  
 1086. The name of the church before   
 1786 was St Mary's Church but in 1786 
 it was changed to St Andrew's. The    
 church which has been modified mamy   
 times dates from the Norman period. At
 one time it had a minstrel gallery in 
 the west end. Notable features include
 the dovecote which a former rector    
 built in the tower. This has now been 
 sealed up to prevent damage to the    
 clock. There is a peal of six bells-  
 the oldest bell dates from 14  . On   
 the chancel wall there is a tablet    
 dedicated to the Seymour family.      
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
