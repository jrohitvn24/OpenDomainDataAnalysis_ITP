 up at{7.00 a.m.}and having breakfast. 
 At{8.00 a.m.}she sets of for work. She
 works at the colleges in{Worcester}and
{Evesham}.She is a part-time lecturer  
 at both of them. She lectures in law. 
 It is{20 miles}to Worcester and{2}    
{miles}to Evesham. She trained to do   
 this about 4 years ago. It meant a lot
 of study at home.                     
  Her hobbies are collecting antiques, 
 stamps and gardening. She swims, walks
 and visits gardens and houses in her  
 spare time.                           
  She does the decorating, cooks the   
 meals and does most of the other work.
 She also has a cleaning lady to clean 
 the house.                            
  Her favourite programme on television
 is Barchester Chronicles.
