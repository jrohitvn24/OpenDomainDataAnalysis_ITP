		<title>10THE BUILDING OF THE MOUNT</title>
		<content> Cormoran lived in a forest by the sea.
 He wanted to build a large hill out of
 granite As he was a lazy giant he made
 his wife Cormelian collect all the    
 stones. She also had to travel        
 farthest away to find the best        
 granite. One day the giant had fallen 
 asleep, so she decided to get the     
 greenstones which were nearer. When   
 she was half way to the Mount the     
 giant woke up and saw her. He kicked  
 her and she dropped the stone and ran 
 into the forest to hide until he had  
 finished building the Mount by        
 himself.                              
                                       
 The stone is now called the Chapel    
 Rock, because many years later a      
 chapel was built on it. It is a large 
 greenstone rock on the beach at       
 Marazion, near the end of the         
 causeway.                             </content>
