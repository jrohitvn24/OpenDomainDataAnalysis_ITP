		<content>{Was food any different?               
 Mr. Edwards, who owned the farm       
 opposite Ravenfield school came round 
 with zinc lined milk cans and ladled  
 pint measures into our jugs. To keep  
 milk fresh we kept it in terracotta   
 pots, and jugs. Meat was wrapped in a 
 cloth and then put in a mesh holder.  
 Tinned food was very rare; bully beef 
 (corned beef) and fruit. In 1935 they 
 didn't have crisps, and a ha'penny    
 worth of sweets normally lasted a     
 week. Fish &amp; chips cost 3d.           
{Is Ravenfield a better place to live  
{now than then?                        
 In some peoples mind it is not; there 
 is not so much social life, but for   
 young people, it is better now because
 there are tennis courts, a youth club 
 and other facilities. We entertained  
 ourselves in 1935, ran a garden fete  
 every year and knew each other well.  </content>
