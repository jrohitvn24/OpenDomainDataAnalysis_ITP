{wheat}at 759585 and 745585.           
   {Rough grazing}predominates         
 elsewhere, as at 756583, 725572,      
 748584 and 752582.                    
    A{detailed survey}of the area      
 showed that the majority of land under
 agriculture was found on the{Hythe    
{Beds}where a wide scale of soil pH    
 from 6 to 8 allowed for greater crop  
 variety such as strawberries,         
 hops,orchards,potatoes, oil seed rape 
 and gooseberries. From our analysis it
 can be concluded that there is a      
{direct correlation between soil       
{fertility and land use in this area.  
 The{rough grazing}was found mainly on 
 river gravels, head deposits, silky   
 clay/Fuller's earth and Folkestone    
 Beds.{Orchards}were found             
 predominantly on the Hythe Beds.
