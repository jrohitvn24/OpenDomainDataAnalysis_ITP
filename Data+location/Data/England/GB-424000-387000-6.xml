		<content> At Hollow Meadows,there was, until    
 circa 1974,a hospital for Mentally ill
 patients,but it has recently been     
 resold and is being rebuilt to        
 serve as a hotel.                     
 The only buildings for religious      
 observance in the area are two        
 Methodist chapels,one in Dungworth,the
 other at Moscar at the S.W.edge of the
 area.                                 
 An interesting historical feature is  
 the presence of a Jew's burial ground 
 at Crawshaw Head behind a building    
 which was a lodge for estate workers. 
 The burial ground is shown on         
 Ordinance Survey maps of circa 1840,  
 but is now derelict,the remains being 
 recently reburied elsewhere as a      
 result of desecration in 1982.
