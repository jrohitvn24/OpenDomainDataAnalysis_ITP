		<title>11FARMING</title>
		<content> The large proportion of the land      
 covered by this survey area is        
 farmland, so farming remains an       
 important aspect of life, although    
 only a very small number of people are
 now engaged in it.  The land is mainly
 Limestone Brash.  Most of the land    
 is used for growing barley, wheat     
 and oilseed rape.  Some maize is also 
 grown.  Although cattle (for beef),   
 and sheep are seen on pasture         
 most livestock are kept in barns,     
 and food brought to them.  Sheep graze
 the grassed area of the Base below the
 communications antennae.  There is    
 very little land that is wild, but    
 there are odd copses for the          
 attraction of game birds and the      
 setting of pheasants ready for the    
 shooting season.  Most pasture is land
 too wet to plough because of the      
 abundance of springs.                 </content>
