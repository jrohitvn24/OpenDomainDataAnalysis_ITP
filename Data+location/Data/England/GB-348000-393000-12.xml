		<title>12Another home in St.Helens</title>
		<content> I don't live in a house, I live in a  
 pub;so I have a different life to     
 other people.                         
   The pub is white and brown with a   
 picture of King Alfred on one side,   
 because it is on a corner.The name of 
 our pub is the Royal Alfred.The pub is
 about 100 years old because the people
 who had it bfore us had it for over 60
 years.                                
   Inside it has been redecorated so it
 looks a bit old fashioned.It has a    
 pool table in the bar,also a bandit   
 and a cigarette machine.Upstairs we   
 used to have a snooker table in one of
 the rooms,but we sold it.             
   Further along the landing is my     
 bedroom, my mum and dad's bedroom and 
 my brother's bedroom.Then the last    
 room is the livingroom and kitchen.In 
 the kitchen we had a wall knocked out 
 so it would be bigger.                </content>
