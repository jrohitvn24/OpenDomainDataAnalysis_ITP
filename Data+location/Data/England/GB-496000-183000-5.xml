		<content> This is a predominantly{wealthy area }
 of the country. The houses are large  
 with secluded gardens. Many families  
 run{two cars}and send their children  
 to{private schools.}The women are     
 fashion concious and enjoy wearing    
 boutique style clothing rather than   
 clothing from Chain Stores.           
   There are lots of{pubs}in the area  
 though the landlords suggested their  
 appeal was mainly to the under 35's.  
 Eating out is popular though there are
 no large restaurants in this          
 neighbourhood.                        
   Many of the residents are {Commuters
  and travel upto 50 miles to work each
 day.It is a mobile population moving  
 on with job promotion. We found only a
 few people who had grandparents born  
 locally.
