		<content> Perhaps the most famous landmark of   
 Skelmersdale is the{Beacon}on top of  
 Ashurst Hill. It stands 173m above    
 sea level to the NE of the town. One  
 of the chain of Lancashire beacons    
 which stretched from Everton,         
 Liverpool to Lancaster Castle, it was 
 built in the 16th Century by Sir      
 William Ashurst to serve as an early  
 warning system against invaders. Now  
 it commands a magnificent{view point  
 over many counties. From the foot     
 of the monument visitors can, on a    
 clear day see the mountains of        
 Snowdonia, the Cheshire Plain, the    
 Pennines, Blackpool Tower, the Lake   
 District Mountains and the splendid   
 panorama of Liverpool and the Mersey. 
 Each Good Friday,an{Ecumenical Passion
 Service is held at the Beacon, when   
 scenes of the Crucifixion are         
 re-enacted by local Christians.       </content>
