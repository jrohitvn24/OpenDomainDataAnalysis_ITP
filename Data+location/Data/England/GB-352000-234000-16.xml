		<content> Although they generally liked the     
 village, there were a number of things
 people would like changed, mostly to  
 do with{transport.  }There is{only one
{bus into the village}- on Wednesdays -
{and one out}- on Saturdays - giving   
 travel straight to and from Hereford, 
 and they would definitely like more   
 buses.   They also miss{"their"       
{railway}line, as it provided quick,   
{cheap transport to and from the city. 
 There are now{many more lorries}than  
 there used to be, and the people don't
 like them going through the village.  
 A lot didn't like Mr Wilcox's works,  
 mostly because of the{huge crane}in   
 his yard, which is not pretty in a    
 small village.   Some of the villagers
 have{trouble with}their{neighbours    
 dumping rubbish on their land, but    
 most of them are reasonably happy.    
 None asked for{shops or a pub.        </content>
