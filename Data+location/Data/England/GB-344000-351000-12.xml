		<content> The village has a{recreation field}for
 football and village events. The      
 adults play football against other    
 teams but the children either play at 
 school or in the Malpas Colts.        
{Badminton}is played by all age groups 
 in the Village Hall. In the pubs      
 adults can play{darts}and{pool.}A new 
{fishing club}has been formed to fish  
 in the local ponds. To play cricket,  
 bowls and tennis we need to go to the 
 town of Malpas. To play golf or swim  
 we need to go to Whitchurch. Our      
 nearest sports hall is in Malpas. The 
 "Evergreens" enjoy bingo, dominoes,   
 card games and gardening. Many enjoy  
 discos, dancing, theatre and walking. 
 Many people cycle through the village 
 and Tilston is part of a{car leisure  
{drive.
