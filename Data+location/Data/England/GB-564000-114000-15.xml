		<title>15VERGES &amp; VERGE CUTTING</title>
		<content> In spring many species can be seen    
 growing on the verges including       
 primroses,celandines and cuckoo flower
 In winter there are many places where 
 the sweet smelling Winter Heliotrope  
 can be found. In May the lanes are    
 lined with Cow Parsely followed by    
 Hogweed and other umbels in July.     
 Fleabane is pelentiful in Aug. and    
 Sept. The verges are machine cut about
 twice a year leaving an unsightly mess
 which is left to rot. In 1985, the    
 Council cut the verge just as the     
 clover, buttercups and moon daisies   
 were coming out. Verges should only be
 cut when the flowers have had a       
 chance to seed. Some verges must be   
 kept cut for safety where growth would
 obsure motorists view. Our lanes are a
 delight in Spring but do need to be   
 tidied up later in the year - as in   
 the days of the roadman.              </content>
