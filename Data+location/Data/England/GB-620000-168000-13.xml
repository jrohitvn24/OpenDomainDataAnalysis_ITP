		<title>13Farming-Crop Survey.</title>
		<content>   We did a brief survey of the crops  
grown in our area.We had noticed that  
there has been quite a change in the   
crops grown in the fields near our     
school,particularly the change from    
cabbages to corn and wheat.many of the 
fields in this area have been used for 
growing potatoes,we counted at least   
six large fields of potatoes,which were
being picked at the time.We counted two
e fields of onions and four of         
cabbages.Most of the others that we    
were able to survey were being used for
cereal growing, mainly wheat andd corn.
Some of the farmers have changed their 
crops because they will make more money
from growing cereal crops rather than  
cabbbages and onions.about a quarter of
the area or less has grass for grazing 
or for making hay.There are very few   
fields actually used for animals.
