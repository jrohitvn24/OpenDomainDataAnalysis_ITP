		<title>03The Fishing Industry.</title>
		<content>  Sidmouth was a fishing village before
 the original Domesday Book, but in the
 last 200 years the fishing industry   
 has declined.                         
  There are 3 fishmarkets in our area; 
 in the Ham, the Market Place and      
 the new indoor market. A variety of   
 fish are sold throughout the 3        
 markets, largely from{Beer,}but       
 occasionally from{Brixham.}Monk fish  
 and salmon are caught in the{Exe      
{estuary.}Only lobsters, crabs and     
 mackerel are both caught and sold in  
 Sidmouth.                             
  Advanced technology in the form of   
 new fishing boats from Brixham and    
 other ports has resulted in local     
 fishermen finding it more profitable  
 to charge tourists to go mackerel     
 fishing and on trips around the bay.
