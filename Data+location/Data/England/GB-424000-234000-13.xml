		<title>13Recreation in the Wolfords</title>
		<content> The Women's Institute and Over 60's   
 meet regularly and provide speakers,  
 outings   and   general   jollity     
 for members from the Wolfords. Much   
 recreation is based at home, with     
 gardening, pets, riding, pigeon       
 racing being popular. The library     
 van calls fortnightly in the Wolfords 
 and monthly in Todenham. Two concerts 
 were held this year in Great Wolford  
 Church. Sport is quite popular with   
 the fire college sports centre nearby,
 and tennis, football and bowls in     
 Shipston on Stour and Moreton on      
 Marsh. There are two private tennis   
 courts and four swimming pools in the 
 block. The nearest cinema is in       
 Banbury and people attend theatres at 
 Stratford on avon, Chipping Norton and
 Oxford.
