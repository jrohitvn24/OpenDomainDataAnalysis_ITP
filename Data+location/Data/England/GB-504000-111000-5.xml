		<content> Amberley village has a doctor's       
 surgery provided by and financed by   
 local residents. National Health      
 Service Doctors from Arundel and      
 pulborough hold surgeries here three  
 times a week. When home visits are    
 necessary Doctors come from these     
 towns. Residents requiring hospital   
 care are sent  to either Chichester or
 Worthing hospitals.                   
 District Nurses are attached to local 
 Doctors and operate from their main   
 surgeries. When village residents     
 require their services they travel by 
 car, often quite long distances, to   
 their patients own homes.             
 Doctors recommend their house-bound   
 patients for Meal on Wheels service.  
 Hot mid-day meals are delivered by    
 volunteers (some from this village). A
 chiropodist attends the village       
 surgery                               </content>
