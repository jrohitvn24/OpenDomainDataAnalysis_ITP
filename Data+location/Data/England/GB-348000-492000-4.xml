		<title>04RIVER (SAFETY AND FLOODS)</title>
		<content>   The{River Kent}was prone to flooding
 in the years{1831-1960},so in{1970}the
 Lancashire River Authority decided to 
 design a{Flood Prevention Scheme}by   
 widening the 81m wide river to 135m   
 wide to prevent flood damage to       
 property. Work started in{1972}and    
 they worked in six phases,working from
 Beezon Field down to Watercrook.      
 Without this scheme floods like the{  
{1954}flood might have been repeated,  
 and in that flood 10,000 cubic feet of
 water passed per second, but the      
 maximum flood occurring since the     
 prevention scheme has been 7,000 cubic
 feet per second.                      
   The water running through the Kent  
 is tested regularly for signs of      
 effluent from a papermill.But now     
 they have  a new sewerage system      
 which neutralises the effluent and    
 then it is put in the river.          </content>
