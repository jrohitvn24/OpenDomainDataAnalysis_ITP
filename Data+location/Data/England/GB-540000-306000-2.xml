		<content> Wisbech St. Mary Church of England    
 Aided Primary School was founded in   
 1726 at Tholomas Drove. In 1859 the   
 school was built on its present site. 
 The school belongs to the             
 ecclesiastical parish of Wisbech St.  
 Mary. The majority of the Governors of
 the school are appointed by the local 
 church and they have a controlling    
 interest in the appointment of staff. 
 The upkeep of the exterior of the     
 building also falls upon the governing
 body. The interior upkeep is the      
 responsibility of the Department of   
 Education.                            
 There are 78 children on the school   
 register. Each child begins school    
 during the term of their fifth        
 birthday and continues until the age  
 of 11yrs. before going on to secondary
 education. We have a staff of 3.5     
 teachers and 3 classes in the school. </content>
