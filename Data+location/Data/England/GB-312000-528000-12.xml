		<title>12Rock Band in Cockermouth</title>
		<content> "Bass Level",the Cockermouth rock band
 have been back to school in a bid to  
 win over a young audience. The four   
 piece group played an unusual gig to  
 help the children with a contribution 
 for the Domesday Project.             
 The band, including lead guitar,bass  
 guitar,drums and vocalist was         
 subjected to intensive interview. They
 delivered a three song set including  
 band favourite "Yesterday's Man", a   
 new song "What would I do" and a cover
 of the Undertone's "Teenage Kicks".   
 The band were in great demand for an  
 autograph session.                    
 Pupils and teachers enjoyed the       
 "Rockschool" experience while Bass    
 Level saw it as a very worthwhile     
 P.R. exercise".
