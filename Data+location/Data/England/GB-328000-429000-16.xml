		<content> Ashton Gardens is a fairly big        
 park.When we visited Ashton Gardens we
 looked at many kinds of trees.The     
 gardener said that in Ashton Gardens  
 there are over 50 kinds of trees.When 
 we had spotted all the trees we could,
 we went on to look at all the         
 activities.There were two bowling     
 greens,a childrens playground with    
 lots of things to play on.There is    
 also football and putting areas,a duck
 pond and aviory.We tested the         
 playground after drawing the War      
 Memorial,the Main Entrance and the    
 Citizens Advice Bureau.First we drew  
 the War Memorial.It had the names of  
 local soldiers who died during the    
 Second World War.Then we drew the Main
 Entrance which was very fancy,it was  
 one of the 5 entrances.It was attached
 to the Citizens Advice Bureau which we
 also drew.                            </content>
