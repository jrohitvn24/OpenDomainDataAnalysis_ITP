This area covers the Eastern part of   
Wantage,a small market town in the Vale
of the White Horse,Oxfordshire, lying  
at the foot of the Berkshire Downs.The 
population of the whole town is about  
7,000.                                 
   Also included are the villages of   
Ardington and East Lockinge,and the    
hamlets of W.Lockinge,Ginge and        
Betterton.Most of the land in this     
area was owned by one family (the      
Loyds) The estate  has now been made   
over to a number of trusts,so that     
death duties will not destroy it.There 
is a large stud that can accommodate   
40 mares and a pig farm with about     
2,000 animals. There is a timber       
yard,where trees are sawn into planks  
when sold.There is also a craft centre 
and a number of small industries.
