 company called Crawford's, who had 500
 acres of land and a large engineering 
 works.

{Mr. Crawford}started a business. It   
 grew big and he started to get a lot  
 of machinery. Every week he sold about
 14 lawn mowers. Now in 1985 he sells  
 about 30 lawn mowers and he repairs 10
 tractors each week He has three       
 lorries and five vans and he has 12   
 steam engines that were used in the   
 olden days. He employs 30 people who  
 do such jobs as mending machinery,    
 restoring steam engines, sorting scrap
 metal as well as selling agricultural 
 machinery.
