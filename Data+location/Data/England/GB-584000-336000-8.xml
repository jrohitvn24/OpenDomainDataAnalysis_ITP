		<title>08LANDSCAPE, N CREAKE</title>
		<content> North Creake is an example of a linear
 village, strung along the B 1355      
 Fakenham-Burnham Market road.         
 From the southern boundary of the     
 parish in the village of the River    
 Burn, the road rised to higher ground 
 to the north.  The parish church is   
 close to the southern boundary, so the
 village lacks a focal point of        
 interest.  This area has light, well  
 drained soil on chalk; arable country 
 with a low rainfall, not counducive to
 a dairy farming of stock cattle       
 industry.                             
 Most of the land, traditionally, has  
 been in the possession of one large   
 estate; there is just one resident    
 farmer, who works his own land, and   
 lives in his own farmhouse.           
 There are several small holdings,     
 rented from the owners of the estate.
