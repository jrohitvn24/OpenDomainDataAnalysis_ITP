		<title>02Farms in Belsay Parish</title>
		<content> This block contains the homesteads for
 10 farms, although some of their      
 fields overlap the block boundary.    
 The average farm size is 300 acres.   
 Approx 1600 acres are rented from     
 landowners and approx 1400 acres are  
 owner/occupied.                       
 Some of the land belonging to         
 landowners is let out annually by     
 auction for the period May to November
 for summer grazing.                   
 Present value of good farmland is     
 from Â£1500 to Â£2500 per acre.         
 Rented land under an agricultural     
 tenancy costs Â£40 to Â£60 per acre per 
 annum. Grass parks for summer grazing 
 make up to Â£100 per acre at auction.  
 The land is classed as heavy loam and 
 is suitable for growing barley, wheat,
 oilseed rape and root crops such as   
 turnips and potatoes.The present trend
 is for farms to be sold when vacated. </content>
