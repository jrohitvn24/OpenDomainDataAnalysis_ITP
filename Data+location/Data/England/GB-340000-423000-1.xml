		<title>01MAIN LAND USE - HESKETH BANK</title>
		<content> The D-Block area we had to survey was 
 mainly concerned with reclaimed land  
 from the River Asland and River       
 Douglas and the adjacent marshes.     
 Shore Road, which marked one of the   
 boundaries, as it name indicates used 
 to be at the edge of the sea and was  
 often flooded until the great banks   
 were built to reclaim the land. The   
 land which has been reclaimed lies    
 mainly to the north of Shore Road. The
 reclaimed land is mainly used for     
 rough grazing for sheep, nearer the   
 rivers, horses and then cattle. Nearer
 the main road the land is used for    
 growing vegetables such as            
 cauliflowers, cabbages, etc.. There   
 are also a lot of glasshouses in the  
 area which are used to cultivate the  
 young vegatables and are also used    
 mainly for growing tomatoes, lettuces 
 and other salad vegetables.           </content>
