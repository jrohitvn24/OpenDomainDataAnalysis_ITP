 Many houses have larger than average  
 gardens, and gardening is a very      
 obvious and time consuming recreation 
 for some.                             
                                       
 Duncton has an active WI ( Womens     
 Institute ) group, which meets once a 
 month in the village hall.            
                                       
 The area is very popular with         
 Ramblers, being close to the South    
 Downs and its famous footpath, the    
 South Downs Way, see "TRANSPORT".     
                                       
 On the whole the area supports those  
 recreational activities that the      
 people actually want, with no obvious 
 attempt to provide sophisticated      
 facilties for the minority, as is     
 common in built-up areas
