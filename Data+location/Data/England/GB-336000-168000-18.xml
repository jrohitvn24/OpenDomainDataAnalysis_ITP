		<title>18POETS WALK</title>
		<content> The footpath which runs around{Wain's 
{Hill}overlooking the Bristol Channel  
 in the{West End of Clevedon}is called 
 Poet's Walk because reputedly poets   
 such as Coleridge,Wordsworth and      
 Tennyson would seek inspiration.      
 Nowadays it is a peaceful place for a 
 pleasant walk giving views of         
 Clevedon,the channel and the south    
 Wales coast.                          
 There does seem to be a need to       
 improve safety fencing around the     
 cliff edges and benches could be      
 restores,having suffered from         
 vandalism.Dogs fouling the footpath   
 have also been a source of local      
 concern.                              
 It is a place which attracts day      
 trippers and though it is quiet during
 the week it gets very busy at the     
 weekend.                              
                                       </content>
