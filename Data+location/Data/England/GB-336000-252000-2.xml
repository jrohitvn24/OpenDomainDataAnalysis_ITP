		<title>02Landscape - General</title>
		<content> The prevailing impression is of a     
 green, flourishing landscape, with    
 areas of woodland and orchards viewed 
 across fields of pasture or arable,   
 which are themselves bounded by       
 hedgerows. The west half of the block 
 has wider stretches of woodland than  
 the east, but trees are visible from  
 any point, especially as they are a   
 feature of the hedgerows too.Where    
 bare earth is to be seen, its red     
 colour adds to the impression of      
 richness. The undulating landscape    
 rises above 500ft at one point only,  
 with the result that the rim of the   
 more distant hills can be glimpsed all
 round. Roads, however, are winding and
 narrow, so that the immediate view is 
 often blocked at road level by the    
 hedgerows - even when trimmed.
