		<title>02Wyre Forest Vista</title>
		<content>      Looking west from the road on the
 side of Trimpley Hill,the expanse of  
 the Wyre Forest is laid out before    
 you, a dark smooth jigsaw piece fitted
 into a lighter area textured with     
 fields and hedges. The trees rise     
 steeply from the side of the River    
 Severn and fill the view. There are no
 landmarks, as the cracks through the  
 forest are obscured by the trees that 
 densely pack the slopes.              
      The valleys of Dowles Brook and  
 its tributaries fold the landscape    
 into softening shades of green as it  
 stretches into the distance, where the
 crown of Titterstone Clee Hill and the
 smaller Brown Clee Hill to the right  
 raise their grassy slopes above the   
 dark line of the forest boundary. In  
 Spring new growth makes many hues of  
 green, while in Autumn, mists tone    
 them down to grey, a majestic sight.  </content>
