		<title>20THE VILLAGE OF SAXTON</title>
		<content>   Saxton is a village located in the  
 undulating countryside of North       
 Yorkshire. It is a quiet village away 
 from the main road, hence there is    
 little traffic passing through the    
 village.                              
   There is no industry in the village 
 as the surrounding countryside is     
 mainly used for agricultural purposes.
 Most of the residents either work on  
 the surrounding farms or in the nearby
 towns. The residents form a very close
 knit community.                       
   The centre of the village is marked 
 by a church and adjoining school. The 
 church is built from local stone and  
 has a spire which can be seen above   
 the roofline of the surrounding       
 buildings. The Post Office is the only
 shop in the village providing basic   
 goods and services.
