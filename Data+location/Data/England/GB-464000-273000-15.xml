		<content>Television is a machine on which you   
can watch programmes.I watch "Street   
Hawk," it is about a motor cycle that  
can do amazing things. It can jump over
cars and lorries,it has immense fire   
power and also has hyper thrust. This  
programme is on Central Television at  
7:30 p.m.                              
After Street Hawk it's Lenny Henry,he  
is a comedian and always tells jokes,  
this programme is on BBC 1. As I watch 
this programme I am taping,on my video 
recorder, a programme on Central T.V.  
called Minder, to watch later.All of   
these programmes are on a Thursday     
evening.                               
On Friday I watch 'Don't wait up,'it is
about a man and his son who are both   
called Doctor Latimer,and they are     
always getting mixed up.After that I   
watch 'Cover up.'
