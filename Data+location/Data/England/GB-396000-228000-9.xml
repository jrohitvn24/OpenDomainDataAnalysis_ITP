		<title>09The Shops in Gotherington</title>
		<content>                                       
 There are two shops in our area.They  
 are both owned by the same family.The 
 main shop is a post office and a      
 general store,the other is a butchers/
 bric-a-brac.The two shops are on      
 Cleeve Road in Gotherington.The shops 
 have been in existance for fifty one  
 years.                                
 The busiest days in the main shop are 
 Thursday and Friday.It sells a variety
 of things including newspapers,food,  
 pens, first aid,cigarettes and drinks.
 Fifty percent of the people using the 
 shop come from outside the village.   
 They have new stock brought in every  
 week. They get their supplies from    
 Birmingham, Cheltenham and other parts
 of Gloucestershire.The people who run 
 the shop think that future trading    
 will remain static.
