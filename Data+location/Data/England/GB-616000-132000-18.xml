		<title>18Fire at Newmans</title>
		<content>   On Thursday, May 27th 1965 a fire   
 broke out in a large furniture store  
 in the main street in Hythe.  The fire
 brigade were alerted by a man who     
 rushed into a tobacconist's opposite  
 Newman's furniture store and asked the
 manager to phone the emergency        
 services.  Ten's of thousands of      
 pounds worth of damage was done when  
 the fire swept along the length of the
 roof. The fire brigade with five      
 engines and a turntable ladder had the
 fire under control within thirty      
 minutes while a crowd of 500 looked   
 on.                                   
   According to one eye witness, Mr.   
 Raymond Fittall, "The roof exploded   
 into flames."                         
   The store manager, Mr. Ron Weaver,  
 lost his flat on the first floor of   
 the building.                         
                                       </content>
