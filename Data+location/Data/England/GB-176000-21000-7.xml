 I have lived in Porthoustock for more 
 years than any other resident (45     
 years).  My father worked at the now  
 disused St. Keverne Quarry which is   
 where two of my three sons and myself 
 worked until we were made redundant 10
 years ago.  I got a job at Dean Quarry
 but one of my sons moved to Penzance  
 and the other to London.  I have 5    
 children and met my wife when she     
 worked here in the Land Army during   
 the War.  I had the chance to move to 
 Plymouth with a job and a house       
 provided but I would not go.  When the
 life boat was taken away 40 years ago 
 the life boat house became a social   
 centre for concerts and village       
 meetings.  It is empty now.  It is    
 essential to have a car if you live   
 here. As boys we often used to get a  
 lift on a quarry lorry to school.     </content>
