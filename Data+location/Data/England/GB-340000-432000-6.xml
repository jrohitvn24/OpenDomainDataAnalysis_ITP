		<content>{A day in the life of the vicar.  }    
 I am usually up by 6a.m. so that I can
 be in church for prayers by 6.45a.m. I
 say mattins each morning and celebrate
 Holy Communion most days. Back home   
 again I have breakfast and after that 
 in my study studying preparing sermons
 and talks, writing letters and seeing 
 people who want to see me.  On two    
 mornings each week I go out with sick 
 Communions taking the Blessed         
 Sacrament to old and sick people who  
 are unable to come to church.         
   I spend all of my afternoons        
 visiting either in hospital or to     
 homes in the parish. I get back to    
 church for Evensong at 5p.m. and then 
 go home for tea. In the evenings I    
 have meetings or to prepare people for
 marriage or baptism  services.I try to
 watch the news on T.V.at10p.m.Then    
 night prayers and so to bed by 11p.m. </content>
