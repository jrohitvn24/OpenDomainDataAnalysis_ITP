		<title>04COMMUNICATIONS AROUND BERROW</title>
		<content>    Despite the scattered community,   
{mail}is collected punctually from     
 postboxes, usually twice a day. Few   
 people need to walk for more than ten 
 minutes to reach a postbox. Two{post  
{offices}in this block provide the     
 usual postal services. As both are    
 food and general supply shops as well,
 this is fairly convenient, though many
 people have a long way to come either 
 by car or cycle.{Phone boxes}are well 
 placed, but too few in number. They   
 are well kept and engineers are prompt
 when breakdowns occur. There are very 
 many{private phones}in the area,      
 connected to automatic exchanges at   
 Bromesberrow or Birtsmorton.{Mail}is  
 delivered once or twice a day in small
 vans. Postmen will also take letters  
 for posting.
