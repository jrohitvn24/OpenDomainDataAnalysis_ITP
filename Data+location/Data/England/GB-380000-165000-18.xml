		<title>18 STONE MINES AT FARLEIGH.</title>
		<content>   The main entrance is at{Main West   
 at{Farleigh Rise.}There are several   
 "satellite" shafts and passages       
 nearby including{Dapstones,Swan       
{(Kingsdown),Longs Platt,}and{Norbin   
{Barton}- all these are in our survey  
 area but there are more besides. All  
 these were originally{stone mines     
 which opened about 1780. The stone was
 too soft for building, but was used in
{interior decoration.}Some stone was   
 used in{Buckingham Palace.            
  There are many stories of the{quarry 
{men}who worked here, including the sad
 case of a man who was crushed by a    
 stone that fell of a cart. A memorial 
 tablet was built into a stone wall    
 near Dapstones at Monkton Farleigh.   
 There was a{tram line,}connecting with
 the railway, which carried stone down 
 the hill.
