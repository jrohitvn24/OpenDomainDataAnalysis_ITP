		<content> In recent years, one type of event has
 become very popular in this area..... 
{Car Boot Sales}or{Boot Sales}as they  
 have come to be called.               
 These are run by various organisations
 within the Town on behalf of their own
 funds or in aid of a charity.         
 Car owners may book a car space on the
 site of the sale for three or four    
 pounds. This entitles them to sell any
 unwanted goods from the{boot}of their 
 car and to keep their takings. They   
 have the advantage of being able to   
 sell off items which they are         
 unwilling to give away to an ordinary 
 "Jumble Sale" and the organisers      
 profit by the car space fees and do   
 not have to be responsible for any    
 unsold goods after the sale. Most     
 vendors now set up a table or trailer 
 behind their car to display their     
 goods as most car boots are too small.</content>
