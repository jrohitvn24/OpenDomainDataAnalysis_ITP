		<content> Travelling north along the A14 you    
 come to the Barracks. This was built  
 as an air base for the war but is now 
 the depot of the Queen's Division.    
  As you enter the Barracks you go     
 through some barriers. There are two  
 tanks either side which were used in  
 World War II. There is a NAAFI shop   
 that is used by army families, a ski  
 slope and squash courts which are used
 by the public.                        
  The houses are up to 50 years old and
 laid out in four estates:{Edinburgh   
{Square, Oxford Close, Cardiff Place   
 and{Cambridge Crescent.}All the work  
 shops are by the airfield. The old    
 tanks and guns are cleaned in them and
 are sent to Duxford air shows.        
  Many children come by bus from the   
 barracks to our school each day as    
 fathers and trainees are posted here  
 from other places and countries.      </content>
