 Heckington mill is the only eight     
 sailed windmill in England.The person 
 who built it was John Nash who is     
 buried in Heckington churchyard.In the
 mill there is a ground floor,a stone  
 floor,a second stone floor,a bin floor
 and the cap.It has five floors        
 altogether.The stairs are normal to   
 begin with but as you get higher up   
 they become steeper.The grindstones   
 are stones with ridges in them to     
 grind the flour.The ground flour goes 
 down a chute to a big bin which is    
 where they fill the bags.The cap is   
 where the gears are to turn the       
 grindstones.There is also a ring type 
 cog which runs round the cap.It turns 
 the cap round when the small fantail  
 is turned. The mill's shutters,stones 
 and bins are being repaired.          </content>
