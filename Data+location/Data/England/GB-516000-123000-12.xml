		<content> Micklepage farm is a seventeenth      
 century{farmhouse}which is owned by   
 the{Anglican Community of St Hilda.   
 The trustees allow groups to come and 
 live at the centre to experience a    
 Christian way of communal life. Groups
 come mainly from{London,}especially   
 the University. There are two barns:  
 one, very old is used as a simple     
 chapel and the other{New Barn}has been
 converted into a common room, bedrooms
 and living areas. Fourteen guests can 
 stay at both the old farmhouse and the
 New Barn. These facilities are used by
 local groups as well. The Rector held 
 confirmation classes here and the     
 local deanery clergy meeting have also
 met there. The local{School}used the  
 Chapel and grounds during their annual
 Ascension Day walk. The job creation  
 scheme has been involved in renovating
 the property.                         </content>
