		<title>09WORKINGTON'S COASTLINE</title>
		<content> The{coastline}from Workington to      
 Harrington has suffered for over 100  
 years from the{tipping of waste       
{materials}mainly from the iron and    
 steel industry.As a result of constant
 tipping the{slag bank}has forced the  
 coastline out to sea.Also there are   
 sewage outlets from both{industrial   
{and domestic users.                   
    The coastline is made up of        
 shillies,boulders and waste           
 materials.It does not attract many    
 visitors due to the sewage etc.{Mobet 
 have plans to reshape the coastline   
 and try and get{tourists}to visit the 
 area.They are hoping to introduce sand
 on the shore and shops by the         
 coastline.                            
   {Wave action}has caused much{erosion
 to the coastline.A section of wall has
 been built to protect the{steel       
{complex.                              </content>
