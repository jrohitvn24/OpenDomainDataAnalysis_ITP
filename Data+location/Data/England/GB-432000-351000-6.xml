		<title>06The Hat Factory</title>
		<content> The Hat Factory is over 200 years old.
 It used to make hats for the Quakers  
 of the villages. It had a water wheel 
 which provided power for machines. It 
 was then taken over by a Company (The 
 Clay Cross Company) quarrying at the  
 back of the factory, and the  Hat     
 Factory was turned into worker's      
 cottages. The railroad ran from the   
 quarry by the Hat Factory into the    
 village and went under the road at the
 post office and then dropped down to  
 the lime kilns at Ambergate. The      
 trucks carrying the lime stone were   
 first pulled by horses and later      
 engines were used.The White House     
 called Thorndale  Cottage was the     
 overseer's house and opposite the Hat 
 Factory was another 3 storey building 
 which has now been taken down where   
 the workers on the railroad lived.
