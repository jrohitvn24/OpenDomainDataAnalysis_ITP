		<title>06A TYPICAL DAY. BY CAROLINE</title>
		<content>   In the morning I wake up at 7.30 and
 get up about 7.45 and get dressed.I   
 get mum and dad a cup of tea.I go to  
 school at 8.45 in the car.            
   When I get to school I have a natter
 to Libby,my best friend,and have an   
 argument.I say to my teacher,"Hello,  
 hello,hello."                         
   In school we have register and      
 Assembly.Then I do maths and reading  
 with intervals in the clock room for  
 another argument with Libby.          
   After dinner I make friends with    
 Libby,but then I break friends with   
 Libby in the clock room.I do some work
 and then it's break.We have a fight   
 with Adam and Daniel and we win.      
   Then I go home and play with Libby  
 for half an hour.I have tea and watch 
 TV.I go to bed about 9.30pm.I read in 
 bed until about 1.00.
