		<title>09Wallasey Golf Club.</title>
		<content> Wallasey Golf Club was founded 92     
 years ago and is situated among the   
 sandhills on the coast.The course was 
 altered in 1936 and extended from 5100
 to 6820 yards.                        
 It is considered a difficult course   
 because of the prevailing wind blowing
 from the sea.Also the sandy soil dries
 the course up in summer but the sand  
 keeps the grass dry in winter and it  
 can be played on throughout the year. 
 During the{2nd World War}the{Home     
{Guard}used the course to stop enemy   
 tanks landing onshore by setting tank 
 traps and lines of coiled barbed wire.
 The club has 415 members who mostly   
 live in the Wallasey area.The par for 
 the course is 72.A good golfer can    
 score 73 because 36 is possible on the
 way out but it is difficult to return 
 in 36.
