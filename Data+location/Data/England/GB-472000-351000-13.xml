		<content> The{Church of England}is the principal
 religion. One vicar, aided by a lay   
 reader, presides over Rolleston, Upton
 and Morton parish churches. Services  
 are held weekly. In Fiskerton, the    
 fortnightly services at the{Methodist 
 church are conducted by either the    
 Southwell based minister or by a lay  
 preacher. Attendance is usually poor  
 at all the churches except for the    
 main religious festivals. Not many{   
{Roman Catholics}reside in the area.   
 There are{Sunday schools}at Rolleston 
 and Fiskerton but the majority of     
 children do not attend these.         
{Henri's Evangelical Revival}meets     
 every Saturday evening and on public  
 holidays in the Methodist church.     
 Members come from all over the        
 country, but some, including the      
 founder, live locally.{  }
