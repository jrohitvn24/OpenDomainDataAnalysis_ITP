		<title>12Old Folks Attitudes:Fairford</title>
		<content> Four old people were asked  questions 
 about the{changes}which have taken    
 place in the Fairford area during     
 their lives.                          
 They thought there is more{vandalism} 
 now due largely to bored. They        
 believed schools should be able to use
 the cane.                             
 They thought the{Air Force Base}was   
 not much of an asset but it made      
 employment for some local people,     
 employed in cleaning,radio and tv     
 rentals,canteen assistants, as well as
 the Air Force Personnel.              
 Having moved at least once they still 
 liked living in the Fairford Area     
 because they were born there and      
 their friends still live there.       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
