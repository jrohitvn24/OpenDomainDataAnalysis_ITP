		<title>19HOUSING IN THE DEARNE AREA</title>
		<content> Most of the houses in{Goldthorpe}are  
{terraced houses,}while in{Bolton}the  
 majority are{semi-detached}council    
 houses. A lot of people have bought   
 their houses from the{National Coal   
{Board.                                
 Many of the streets in Goldthorpe have
 been closed to cars and are now       
 leisure areas with{gardens and seats. 
 Two new private housing estates have  
 been built by Weaver Brothers at      
 Lowfield and West Bolton on land      
 bought from local farmers.            
 I live in a Council House on Carr Head
 Lane in Bolton. We had to move out of 
 our house while the Council{modernised
 it. It took four weeks but now we have
 a new kitchen and bathroom. Barnsley  
 Council have nearly finished all the  
 houses on our street.
