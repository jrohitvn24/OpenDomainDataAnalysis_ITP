		<title>14SUTTON VILLAGE</title>
		<content> Sutton is a residential village. Much 
 of the housing is built along the old 
 Yarmouth Road. There are two small    
 estates of bungalows, a council house 
 estate and an estate of semi-detached 
 houses. Many of the older houses are  
 on Church Road. One of the oldest     
 buildings in the village is Durrant's 
 Farmhouse which was built around 1660.
 The village has a Post Office, a      
 general store and a garden centre. Mr 
 Flatman has a pottery on Church Road. 
 On the corner of Staithe Road is the  
 village pond. It was cleared this year
 and new vegetation is appearing.      
 Moorhens and ducks have nested in the 
 reeds this year. Drainage on the pond 
 corner is poor as this road is very   
 low lying. It often floods in heavy   
 rain.
