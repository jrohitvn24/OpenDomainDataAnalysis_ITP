  Since 1921 the Maddermarket Theatre  
 has been the home of the{NORWICH      
{PLAYERS.}The theatre is a             
 reconstructionof an Elizabethan       
 theatre, and was founded by{NUGENT    
{MONCK}who was also the first producer 
 of the players. He died in 1958.      
  The Norwich Players produce a wide   
 variety of plays and other entertain- 
 ments including Old Time Music Halls, 
 modern and classic dramas and         
 pantomimes. They are best known for   
 their{SHAKESPEARE}productions, having 
 performed all of his plays on the open
 stage much in the style of the        
 original productions.                 
  The building itself was once a Roman 
 Catholic chapel, but now houses the   
 small theatre and a coffee lounge.
