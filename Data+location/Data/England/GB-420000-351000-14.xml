		<content> The{B5056}and{B5035}roads provide     
 links to Wirksworth and Ashbourne,    
 although neither road features        
 extensively in the surveyed area.  The
 nearest sizeable village is           
 Brassington and there is a reasonable 
 4 metre wide tarred road linking up   
 with Bradbourne.  Apart from these the
 roads are narrow and some of those    
 leading to individual farms almost    
 impassable in wet weather.            
 Some of the farms are virtually       
 cut-off during extreme Winter weather.
 The large number of{footpaths}may be  
 explained by the nearness of the area 
 to the Peak District National Park,   
 and by the area's own attractive      
 landscape.  Some of the footpaths     
 surveyed had fallen into disuse due to
 farmers' intervention.
