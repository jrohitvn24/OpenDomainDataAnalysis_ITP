		<content> The most distinctive feature of the   
 buildings of the area is the locally  
 quarried grey limestone and sandstone.
 The limited number of pre-17th Century
 buildings is due to the conversion to 
 stone building with the diminution of 
 the forest of Wensleydale.            
 Outside the villages, the most        
 prominent and profuse type of building
 is the field barn, a national survey  
 of which is being made at present. The
 barns were built to a fairly standard 
 pattern to house both stock and       
 fodder. The walls are constructed of  
 limestone with a rubble infill and    
 various courses of through stones. The
 corners (quoins) are primitive, but   
 effective long and short work of the  
 more-easily-dressed sandstone. Many   
 features of the barns still retain    
 dialect names directly derived from   
 Old Norse.                            </content>
