		<title>14THE SEWAGE WORKS</title>
		<content> The sewage works,just to the south of 
 the {West End of Clevedon}was opened  
 in 1973 by Sir John Vernon Wills.     
 The{Kingston Seymour}works is in the  
 Somerset division of sewage works. It 
 was built for Long Ashton Rural       
 District Council.                     
 It takes sewage from Clevedon         
 ,Portishead,Weston,Long Ashton,       
 Tickenham and neighbouring villages.  
 There is 50 miles of pipeline at the  
 works but the chemical treatment plant
 has been shut down because of cost.   
 As the population grows and more water
 is used there is obviously more dirty 
 water to be cleaned before it can be  
 returned to the water courses. In the 
 future there will be more re-use of   
 water so it is important to understand
 how used water can be treated to avoid
 pollution.
