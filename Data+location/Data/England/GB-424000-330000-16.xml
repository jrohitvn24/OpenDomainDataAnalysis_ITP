		<content>{MARCUS:}On Wednesday nights I go dog  
 training at a farm near Etwall.I used 
 to go in the top class with my dog    
 Radish,but she got knocked down by a  
 car and killed.Now I have a new dog   
 called Kym.I only got her on Tuesday, 
 so I have only taken her once.During  
 the hour we do things like heelwork,  
 sit-stays,recalls and down-stays.     
{JAMES:}On Saturdays my spare time is  
 taken up by Ten-pin bowling.In the    
 League you play 3 games.You have to   
 find the right sized ball so that it  
 does not rub your skin, and it helps  
 you to bowl better.The idea is to bowl
 the ball down an oiled alley without  
 going over the foul line,and to knock 
 as many pins down as possible.        
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
