		<title>01KENTON AND ASPALL, SUFFOLK</title>
		<content> The area is primarily an agricultural 
 one and contains two villages, Kenton 
 (pop 140) and Aspall (pop 40). The    
 land is medium to heavy day and the   
 products include sugar beet, wheat,   
 pigs, beef, rape and apples. There are
 four moated houses, Aspall House,     
 Aspall Hall (where the Cyder House    
 is), Kenton Hall and Moat Farm, Kenton
 (where there is an apple orchard run  
 commercially). The only               
 non-agricultural enterprise in the    
 area (excluding the Cyder House) is a 
 food store and distribution centre in 
 Kenton. The workers there do not live 
 in the area and with labour on the    
 farms being even further reduced as   
 the agricultural environment becomes  
 harsher, many of the inhabitants work 
 outside the area. History demands a   
 mention. Blood Hall (sq. 11) is a     
 memory of a battle against the Danes. </content>
