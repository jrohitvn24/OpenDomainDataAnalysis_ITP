		<content>   Mr Honeybun uses about 50 tonnes of 
 chemical{fertilizers}a year on his    
 grassland. He has a lot of machinery  
 including four tractors, a digger,    
 silage trailers and a variety of some 
 20 other pieces of{machinery.         
   Mr Honeybun has been farming here   
 for about 20 years,he says he wouldn't
 like to stop{farming}and he couldn't  
 really even if he wanted to,because   
 his money is all tied up with the     
 farm. He likes some work on the farm  
 and dislikes other work but on the    
 whole he likes his job and gets       
{satisfaction}out of it.
