		<title>18PROPOSED BYEPASS</title>
		<content> Brockworth is in urgent need of a     
 byepass because of the increasing     
 traffic flow along Ermin St.,the A417 
 Trunk Road which splits the community 
 in two.This road provides an important
 link between the M4 and M5 and is a   
 major route from the South to the     
 Midlands and the NW. Conjestion,noise,
 fumes,safety of pedestrians,and future
 expansion of the Trading Estate are   
 all important factors. Three routes   
 were considered:                      
 YELLOW Southern favoured by 11%       
  More effect on property,less economic
 RED Northern favoured by 64%          
  Major impact on landscape,most costly
 BLUE favoured by 25%.                 
  Severe on property,best econ.return. 
 THE SECRETARY OF STATE'S DECISION.    
  The BLUE ROUTE slightly modified in  
 order to minimise adverse effects on  
 properties. To be public enquiries.   </content>
