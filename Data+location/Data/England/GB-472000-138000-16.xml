		<title>16The Watercress Line Railway</title>
		<content>    The private steam{Watercress Line} 
 railway, run on part of the former    
 British Rail route from Alton to      
 Winchester was opened on April 30th   
 1977 between Ropley and Alresford.    
 Since then the line has been extended,
 until the complete ten-mile run from{ 
{Alresford to Alton}was opened on May  
 18th 1985.                            
    The line, operated by the{Mid-Hants
{Railway Preservation Society Limited,}
 is run by volunteers who not only laid
 the track and rebuilt or restored all 
 the buildings on the line, but also   
 are responsible for the restoration   
 and running of all the rolling stock, 
 maintainance of the line itself, and  
 the operation of its four stations.   
   {Alton Station}forms the interchange
 with the{British Rail}line to{Waterloo
 station in London.
