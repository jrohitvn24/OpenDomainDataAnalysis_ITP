		<title>05Living in a rural area</title>
		<content> Living in a rural area is a big       
 problem, as the main shops are in     
 Braunton and Barnstaple. It's more    
 expensive because to get to a         
 supermarket is about 5 miles away. To 
 get to  good big shops you have to go 
 to Barnstaple or even Exeter.The shops
 in Croyde and Georgeham are more      
 expensive. Most people wouldn't prefer
 to live in the city.Some advantages   
 are the beaches and the countryside.  
 Most people I asked that didn't drive 
 a car did most of their shopping in   
 the area.But people who drove a car   
 did most of their shopping out of the 
 area.We also have to travel about 3   
 miles to school. I asked people       
 whether they had most of their        
 relatives living in the area.Most     
 people said no they didn't have       
 relatives in the area.
