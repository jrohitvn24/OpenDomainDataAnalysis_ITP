		<title>05Ashington Colliery.</title>
		<content> Ashington is here because there is    
 coal underground.                     
  Ashington colliery opened in 1850.It 
 is now the only mine in the town,and  
 one of the few mines in Northumberland
 .580 men work underground.They produce
 1,300 tons of coal a day.There are    
 surface workers who sort and clean the
 coal.The mechanics and engineers      
 repair underground and surface        
 machinery.The colliery has not changed
 much since it was first opened.They   
 think it will run out of coal in 1992.
                                       
   My dad works at Ashington           
 Colliery.He digs coal out of the      
 ground and uses a big coal cutter with
 his friend.It is pretty dark down the 
 mine and after school I wait for him  
 coming home from work in the NCB car  
 park.My dad likes working down the    
 pit.                                  </content>
