		<content> Camberley is now getting too built up,
 too many{office blocks}with no owners.
 There are too many new houses and     
 housing estates, and not enough beds  
 in the hospital.                      
                                       
 Camberley's main roads are always     
 overcrowded with not enough traffic   
 wardens.                              
                                       
 The train services to London and      
 Guildford are good although perhaps   
 there should be some new trains.      
                                       
 Living quite near the Motorway, you   
 can hear the traffic when the wind is 
 blowing that way, but more annoying   
 are the{helicopters}which frequently  
 fly overhead.                         
                                       
                                       
 Well that's what I think!             </content>
