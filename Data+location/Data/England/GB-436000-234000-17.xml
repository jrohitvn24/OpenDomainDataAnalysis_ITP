		<content> 'THATCHER' FREEMAN HAS LIVED IN EPWELL
 ALL HIS LIFE AND IS ONE OF THE MOST   
 FAMOUS TRADITIONAL CRAFTSMEN IN THE   
 AREA. HE BEGAN THATCHING ROOFS WHEN HE
 WAS 14 AND RICK THATCHING WHEN HE WAS 
 16. IT TAKES 30 DAYS TO COMPLETE ONE  
 ROOF OF ABOUT 30 FEET AND THIS WOULD  
 COST FROM Â£3-7000. IT IS  WELL-PAID   
 THOUGH SOMETIMES IT IS A VERY HARD JOB
 ESPECIALLY IN THE BAD WEATHER. HE     
 ENJOYS HIS WORK WHEN HE IS THATCHING. 
 HE USES SPECIAL MATERIALS OF REEDS    
 FROM DEVON AND IF IT IS PROPERLY      
 MAINTAINED A THATCHED ROOF WILL LAST  
 FOR 45 YEARS (25 YEARS IF IT IS       
 NEGLECTED). HE WAS VERY INTERESTING   
 AND TALKATIVE AND HIS HOBBIES ARE     
 DANCING, DOMINOES AND HE ALSO LIKES   
 FOX-HUNTING. HE ALSO GETS INVOLVED IN 
 PUBLIC WORK IN THE VILLAGE HALL. HE   
 ALSO HAS HIS OWN FARM.
