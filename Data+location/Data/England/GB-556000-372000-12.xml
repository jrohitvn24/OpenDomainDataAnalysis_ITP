		<title>12TRADE IN THE VILLAGE CENTRE</title>
		<content> Mr Hoyes owns a shop in the centre of 
 the village.His shop was once the     
 lifeboat house  in1571.His shop is now
 in three sections.A fancy goods       
 section,a toys section,(in a new      
 octagonal building)and a hardwear     
 section.In the summer time he works a 
 seven day week from 9am to 9pm.He has 
 five staff in the summer.In the winter
 he works five and a half days a       
 week.He only works him-self. The shop 
 was one of three shops that suvived   
 the 1953 flood.In a whole year 80% of 
 his trade comes from the summer and   
 only 20% comes from winter.The        
 population has doubled in the last 20 
 years to 2209.With 20,000 tourists    
 visiting annually.A new bus station is
 to be built next to the village green 
 to take coaches and buses from all    
 over the country.Mr Hoyes hopes that  
 this will increase his trade.         </content>
