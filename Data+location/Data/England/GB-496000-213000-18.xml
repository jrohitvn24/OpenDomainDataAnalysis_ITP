		<content>  I get up at 7am.My usual breakfast is
 Rice Krispies, toast and tea.I leave  
 for School at 8.30am:the bell goes at 
 8.55.We have no uniform but we look   
 nice in our own choices.We have       
 Register,Prayers and return to the    
 classrooms.I am in 9-11yrs class 3.   
 Lessons always include Maths from     
 10-10.45,and English in one form or   
 another.Dinner break is from          
 12.15-1.30pm and school finishes at   
 3.30pm .No afternoon break.In my own  
 time I learn ballet, recorders and    
 belong to a Drama Club.I read lots of 
 books and enjoy playing in the woods. 
 I have many friends but only one or   
 two close friends.Often I have        
 Shepherds Pie and Angel Delight for   
 pudding. Hot Chocolate settles me for 
 bed at 8pm(but I read till 9pm!)I have
 a cuddly teddy called Buffy to whom I 
 tell all my secrets.He's older than me</content>
