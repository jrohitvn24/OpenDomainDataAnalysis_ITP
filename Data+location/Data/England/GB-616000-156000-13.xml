 85% of the houses were built in the   
 postwar period with the remainder of  
 inter-war construction. 75% were      
 semi-detached, 15% detached &amp;         
 10% terraced. In this area the gardens
 were more spacious &amp; the density of   
 housing significantly lower than in   
 Spring Lane. The houses were          
 well-maintained- the paintwork &amp;      
 exterior were generally impressive. It
 was noticeable that many properties   
 had been improved by the addition of  
 extensions, new wall-facades, windows 
 &amp; even roofs. Some residents          
 complained, however, about the absence
 of open space &amp; the danger to         
 school-children caused by crossing the
 A2. As this estate has expanded       
 outwards, some encroachment on to     
 valuable orchard land has been        
 unavoidable.                          </content>
