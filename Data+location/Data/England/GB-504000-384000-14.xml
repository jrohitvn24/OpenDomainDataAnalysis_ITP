		<title>14The Buslingthorpe Dragon</title>
		<content>    The church contains the tomb of{Sir
{John de Buslingthorpe.}The stone      
 effigy lies cross-legged in chain mail
 armour. It had been inverted and used 
 as a paving stone on the floor of the 
 pulpit. Fortunately this preserved it 
 in good condition.                    
    The legend is that a terrible      
{dragon}lived in the{Buslingthorpe     
 marshes frightening and killing the   
 local people.{Sir John}went out and   
 slaughtered the dragon then drained   
 the marshes so no more terrible beasts
 could lurk there. On still Autumn days
 the fog usually forms first and is    
 thickest around{Buslingthorpe}and it  
 is easy to imagine that the{dragon}is 
 still there.                          
    By the way, we believe that        
{Buslingthorpe}is the longest place    
 name in England which contains no     
 letter used more than once.           </content>
