		<title>14RECREATION - AS A TEENAGER</title>
		<content> Life as a teenager in Keevil is a mix-
 ture of various activities. There's   
 the playing field where we have to    
 make our own fun. Every Thursday we   
 have a Youth Club in Keevil Hall. Mr  
 Davis and Mrs House run it one week   
 and Mr and Mrs Blackmore (my mum and  
 dad) run it another week. We can play 
 snooker/pool, table tennis, bagatelle,
 and we've bought our own ghetto-      
 blaster. We recently helped to clear  
 up and tidy the churchyard. As we have
 to find our own transport, we can't   
 just wander off into the town, Trow-  
 bridge, where most of us go to school 
 at Clarendon Comp. Ten people go      
 fishing at Busley Bottom.We are lucky,
 there are no teenagers with drug or   
 smoking problems. We think the older  
 people call us vandals and we get very
 downhearted about this. Living as a   
 teenager in Keevil is GREAT!!!        </content>
