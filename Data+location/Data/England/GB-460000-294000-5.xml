		<title>05The Grand Union Canal</title>
		<content> The northern part of this grid        
 contains a portion of the Grand Union 
 Canal which was built to link         
 Leicester with London. In doing so it 
 would link up with the celebrated "X" 
 System invisiged by the great canal   
 engineer James Brindley. This was     
 designed to link the ports of         
 Liverpool,Bristol,Hull and London, so 
 by using this canal the Kilby area is 
 still linked to these ports. The only 
 traffic on this canal today is part of
 the leisure industry,indeed it is     
 still heavily used by pleasure craft. 
 Local people use the canal for        
 recreational purposes especially dog  
 walking and fishing. The canal is kept
 in good repair,painting work having   
 recently been done. The canal provides
 good views over the rolling fields    
 towards Kilby. The block contains five
 sets of locks.                        </content>
