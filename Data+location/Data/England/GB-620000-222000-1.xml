		<title>01ANCIENT KIRBY</title>
		<content> Kirby used to be near to where Birch  
 Hall Farm is today because it was     
 higher ground.They moved down to where
 there was a better water supply.      
     Kirby used to be the biggest of   
 the Sokens but now is one of the      
 smallest.                             
     The cottages were made mostly of  
 timbers and the two still standing    
 today were called Dane Cottage and    
 Meadow View.They were semidetached    
 so you had to go up the stairs once to
 get into Dane Cottage then up some    
 more stairs next door to get up stairs
 in Meadow View. You could date        
 buildings by the joins of the timber  
 frames. These cottages were found  to 
 have old fashioned Scadinavion join   
 and were build in about 1530 just     
 after the church was build.Kirby was  
 in the original Domesday Book.
