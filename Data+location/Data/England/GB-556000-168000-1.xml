		<title>01OVERVIEW  DARENTH VALLEY</title>
		<content>     The area defined by the block     
 consists largely of arable farmland:  
 open fields enclose some scattered    
 patches of woodland. Chalk is quarried
 at Pinden End Farm. Besides individual
 farms, there are 3 main areas of      
 settlement. To the West, located in   
 the{Darent Valley,}and built along the
 R.Darent, lie the villages of{Horton }
{Kirby and South Darenth.}In the       
 latter, new light industry now        
 occupies the buildings of the old     
 paper mill. Longfield, to the East, is
 connected with South Darenth by the   
 railway line from London to Dover.    
   The railway, which bisects the block
 from east to west, crosses the river  
 at S. Darenth on a brick viaduct      
 completed in 1860. The other main line
 of communication is the B260 road,    
 passing N.W. through Longfield        
 towards Dartford.                     </content>
