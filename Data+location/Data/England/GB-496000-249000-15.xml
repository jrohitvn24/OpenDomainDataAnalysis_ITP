		<content> Althogh playing less of a central role
 in village life than in the past (the 
 choir and Mother's Union have gone)   
 there are still regular Sunday        
 services,a team of bell ringers has   
 formed and a women's organisation     
 meets monthly.                        
 Recent discussion at a church meeting 
 considered future life at St.         
 Leonard's.It was suggested that Family
 Service be made more informal,        
 brighter in style, with opportunity   
 for children and young people to      
 participate.The Sunday School could be
 linked with the Family Service.
