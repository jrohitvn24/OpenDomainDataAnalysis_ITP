		<title>09Holmfirth Flood-1944</title>
		<content> On the 29th May,1944,a Whit Monday,   
 there was a very bad storm in the     
 Holme Valley.The river rose to 18 feet
 in places.Mills and houses were       
 damaged and many of the buildings in  
 Holmfirth were brought down.Fields    
 were covered with stone clay and      
 debris.Here are some pieces of        
 information from people who lived     
 during the 1944 flood.                
{Someone from Elephant &amp; Castle pub}   
 The flood was at its worse between    
 6.30p.m.to 7.00p.m.It rose to about   
 4'9" up the building.The water did not
 recede properly until about 8.30p.m.  
{Someone who lived on Scarfold}        
 The water started coming in the       
 bottom houses about 6.00p.m.and rose 6
 feet altogether.A clock was stopped at
 6.30p.m.;fairly soon after the flood  
 waters began to settle.
