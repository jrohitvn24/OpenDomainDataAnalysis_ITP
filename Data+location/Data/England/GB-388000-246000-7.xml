		<content> Pirton Church is known as St. Peters  
 Church. St. Peter was crucified up    
 side down and there is an up side down
 carving of St. Peter on the archway   
 inside the church. The archway        
 is norman. In the eighteenth Century  
 the bell tower fell down. When the    
 builders were repairing it a little   
 stone fell down and people thought it 
 was a token the pilgrims took to      
 canterbury.There are three bells in   
 Pirton Church. The walls are 1m thick 
 for protection. The first baptism     
 was on February seventh 1813, it was a
 little girl called Lucy. On April     
 eighth 1866 a little boy called       
 William, who lived at{Hermatige farm,}
 was christened. We found this out     
 from the records which are still kept 
 inside the church.
