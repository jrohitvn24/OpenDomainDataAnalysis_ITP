		<content>     An example of change in the       
 countryside has been brought about by 
 'Pick Your Own'. Mr.W.H.Meredith owns 
 Woodland Farm and uses approximately 3
 hectares of his land for 'Pick Your   
 Own'. He grows strawberries,          
 raspberries, gooseberries,red and     
 blackcurrants, broad beans and peas.  
 He began this method of marketing 5   
 years ago, and has found it very      
 successful for someone who only farms 
 market garden crops on a small scale. 
 The advantages are, that people come  
 to him and pick their own - he does   
 not have to employ casual labour to   
 pick the crop, nor organise transport 
 to market. The main disadvantage is   
 the waste of the crop, through not    
 being picked systematically, being    
 eaten  or being trodden into the      
 ground. He also farms 30 hectares of  
 cereals and sugar beet.               </content>
