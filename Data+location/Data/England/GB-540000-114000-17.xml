		<content> We did various exercises like sitting 
 on the bottom and floating on our     
 front and back.Then I managed to swim 
 half the pool.I changed quickly       
 because it was cold.Then it was dinner
 time.We had a nice meal with rhubarb  
 crumble for pudding.After our meal we 
 played in the playground.I played Hot 
 Chocolate with some other girls.In the
 afternoon we worked on our Spellaway  
 and Direction books and then had a    
 game of cricket on the recreation     
 ground.Mr.Yeomans read the class story
 book until home time. I cycled home   
 and played with my brother Leigh until
 it was time for tea.We then watched   
 some television until it was time for 
 bed.
