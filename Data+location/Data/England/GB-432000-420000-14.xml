		<content> The{County Hall}in Wakefield is the   
 headquaters of the{West Yorkshire}    
{County Council.}The building was built
 in 1898. The Council Chamber has four 
 ladies painted on the ceiling         
 representing Learning, Power, Law and 
 Order and Wisdom. West Yorkshire      
 County Council is very important      
 indeed because it decides where       
 rubbish dumps are going to be. They   
 also employ the Police and decide how 
 many firemen are required and how many
 fire engines are needed. They are also
 responsible for road safety and the   
 buses. It plans for new roads to be   
 built and old roads to be repaired. In
 1986 West Yorkshire County Council is 
 going to be abolished. We do not know 
 what will happen to the services that 
 the County Council are responsible    
 for.
