		<content>Some of the buildings in the village   
date back to Tudor Times including     
Little Gables which was an old         
workhouse for widows.There are now lots
more houses with a population of 375   
people who look after their village    
very well as they have won the best    
village in Babergh twice.              
The village green is a 24 acre golf    
course which started in 1907.If you    
live in Newton you can use the 9 hole  
course when you want and don't pay.An  
outsider pays 70 pounds a year for     
membership.                            
The school was closed down during the  
war.When it reopened it became Newton's
village hall which can be rented out.  
The church is called "All Saints".It is
a Norman church down Church Lane and   
the vicar is shared with two other     
parishes.
