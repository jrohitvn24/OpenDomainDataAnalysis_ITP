		<content> In Delcombe today there are four      
 derelict dwellings.  One being a small
 detatched bungalow still standing but 
 in a very angerous state.  The second 
 dwelling, a detched house standing in 
 a field has now completely collapsed  
 leaving only the chimney stack erect. 
 the remaining two are semi-detched    
 cottages too badly decayed to be of   
 any use as homes although the third   
 one is still being lived in though it 
 is only just habitable.  All these    
 dwellings were occupied about twenty  
 years ago.  It would appear that all  
 these dwellings will eventually be    
 razed to the ground and the land      
 cleared for farming.  Rebuilding being
 out of the question because of to-days
 prohibitive costs.                    
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
