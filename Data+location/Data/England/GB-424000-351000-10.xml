		<content> Carsington and Hopton Womens Institute
 was founded forty five years ago and  
 today has twelve members who meet     
 together once a month in each others  
 homes because we have no village      
 hall.At our meetings we invite        
 speakers who give talks on a variety  
 of topics.                            
  Thursday Club is run by Mrs Springall
 in her own home for children aged     
 between 9 and 14.The children play a  
 variety of games and there is also a  
 religious content.Approximately twelve
 children attend every fortnight.      
  Sunday School (also run by Mrs       
 Springall) takes place once a         
 fortnight and is attended by many     
 children from the village.There is a  
 party every year for the children who 
 attend Sunday School and Thursday     
 Club.
