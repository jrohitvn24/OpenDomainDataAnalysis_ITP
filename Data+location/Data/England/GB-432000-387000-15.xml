		<title>15A COTTAGE IN SHEFFIELD</title>
		<content>    I live in a cottage in Crookes,    
{Sheffield.}It used to be two cottages 
 but they were knocked together to make
 one. It was built in the{1850's,}and  
 is a nice house to live in.           
                                       
    One of the rooms in my house is    
 built over the garage and when it is  
 windy the floorboards rattle, if you  
 are in that room then, it feels as if 
 the room is swaying. My parents' room 
 used to be a stable and so did the    
 garage, there is still an old horse   
 shoe hanging on the wall outside the  
 garage.                               
                                       
     My house is called{Cocked Hat     
{Cottage.}This is because it is built  
 on a piece of land which is triangular
 like a cocked hat, the kind that      
 pirates used to wear.
