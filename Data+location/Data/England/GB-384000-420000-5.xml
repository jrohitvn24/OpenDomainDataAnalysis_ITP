		<content> We have been going round asking people
 questions about housing because we are
 carrying out a project.We have asked  
 112 people and that is almost all our 
 school.Most of the people live in     
 semidetatched houses, most of which   
 are council houses.  The second       
 most popular is terraced. Most of the 
 houses around here are built out of   
 stone especially old ones.Up Fernhill 
 Drive some new houses are being built.
 The new houses are being built out of 
 pebbledash .The houses made out of    
 pebbledash are to make them look      
 fancy .Five people live on  farms and 
 there are 46 people live in a         
 semidetached house and thirtyfive     
 people live in  houses  called        
 Quasisemi.                            
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
