		<title>04Description of Parbold</title>
		<content>{Landscape:} Parbold is a residential  
 village with many of the inhabitants  
 in the higher-income brackets. To the 
 south of the village lies some        
 agricultural land but lack of open    
 land was noticed in the village       
 itself. It is an attractive village   
 situated on the slopes of Parbold     
 Hill, upon which is Parbold Hill      
 Quarry, whose stone workings have left
 some ugly scars. The gritstone was in 
 great demand for the building of      
 churches and other important public   
 buildings. The Hill itself gives      
 magnificent views and is a popular    
 stopping-off point for visitors.      
{Population:}The village has grown in  
 recent years to an estimated          
 population of about 3,000 people: one 
 thousand of them are under 18; about  
 150 over 18.
