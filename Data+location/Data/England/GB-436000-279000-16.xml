		<content> In the playground we play football,   
 stag,thirty seconds,line tig and      
 French skipping.First break and last  
 break are 15 minutes long and dinner  
 break is 45 minutes long.The younger  
 children like to play He-man,         
 Spiderman,Starwars,Mums and Dads etc. 
 In the playground the girls mostly    
 play French skipping where two people 
 stand in an elastic rope and one      
 person jumps.We have different songs  
 to go with the steps like Banana,     
 Hot Cross Buns and Big Ben.The        
 skipping rope gets higher,thinner and 
 wider.                                
 Some of the Infants have started      
 playing French skipping.They are not  
 very good but are slowly getting      
 better.Sometimes we do not play,we    
 just talk to our friends.
