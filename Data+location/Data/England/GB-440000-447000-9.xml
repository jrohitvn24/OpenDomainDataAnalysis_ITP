		<title>09WETHERBY MARKET</title>
		<content>  Wetherby market came into existence  
 in 1240. It is not very large only    
 having about 23 stalls, although there
 is a wide variety of goods on sale:   
 fruit and veg., handbags, fish and    
 meat, dairy produce, household goods, 
 sweets, flowers, hosiery and bakery.  
 The present traders have been coming  
 for about 10 years, but one has been  
 coming for about 40 years. Some leave 
 home soon after 4.00am in order to get
 here between 6.30 to 7.00 am to set   
 up. One trader had come 44 miles the  
 others were more local. We found that 
 they also go to other markets such as 
 Leeds, Knaresborough, Otley and       
 Skipton. The fruit and vegetable man  
 said he served about a 1000 a day but 
 one only served about 40 a day. Most  
 of the traders like their job and     
 always come unless the weather is very
 bad.                                  </content>
