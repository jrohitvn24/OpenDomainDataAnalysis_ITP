		<title>18FARMING IN COUNTESTHORPE</title>
		<content> In Countesthorpe,30 years ago there   
 were 7 farms and 2 small holdings,but 
 now in 1985 there are 2 main farms and
 one small holding.                    
     There are not a lot of farms in   
 Countesthorpe or Blaby because of the 
 council and housing estates.          
   The two farms in Countesthorpe are  
  called 'The Dolbys'and 'The Clarks'. 
 The Dolbys produce corn and mutton and
 the Clarks produce dairy products.    
  A farmer has to put in a lot of hard 
 work even though he has special       
 equipment eg: combine harvester.      
 Most people have inherited their      
 farms though some have recently bought
 them.                                 
    The soil in Countesthorpe has a    
 lack of nutrients so manure is spread 
 across the land before it is put to   
 use.                                  
                                       </content>
