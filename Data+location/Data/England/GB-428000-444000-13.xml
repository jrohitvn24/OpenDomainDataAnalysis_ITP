		<content>   Weeton residents have inhabited the 
 village for periods extending from 1  
 to 64 years.The village has expanded  
 from 1 cottage (in 1920) to several   
 (in 1985).                            
   Most people work at home or are     
 retired.Occupations include housewife,
 farmworker and,in one case,antique    
 dealer.The children (aged between 4   
 and 11) attend schools at North       
 Rigton,Huby and Harrogate.            
   Leisure time is spent gardening,    
 watching T.V. or attending and        
 helping with local organisations.     
   All Weeton residents shop in Leeds  
 or Harrogate weekly, using cars or    
 buses as transport.There are transport
 problems, but residents feel these are
 outweighed by the beautiful           
 countryside.
