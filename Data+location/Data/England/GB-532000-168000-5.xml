		<content>   The Centre is currently heavily     
 subsidised by the G.L.C and in future 
 will be financed by the Sports Council
 itself. In an attempt to attract more 
 potential customers, concessions for  
 families and the unemployment have    
 been made avaliable. The disabled have
 also been integrated into the scheme  
 of things, which hasn't been easy due 
 to the lack ot structural provision   
 for them when the Centre was          
 constructed in 1963. This has been    
 rectified with the introduction of    
 ramps and so on.                      
   Generally, the community is becoming
 more involved, realizing you don't    
 have to be a Superman (or Superwoman) 
 to enjoy the challenges. A sobering   
 thought to end on though, Archery is  
 available only occasionally on a 'come
 and try it' basis and the participants
 standard isn't high.                  </content>
