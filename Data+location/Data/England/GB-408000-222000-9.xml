		<content>    W.I. stands for Women's Institute. 
 It meets in the Village Hall on the   
 2nd Wednesday of each month.There are 
 28 members, and about 22 come to each 
 meeting.Our teacher is the President  
 this year.                            
    At each meeting,there is W.I.      
 business,then a talk on such subjects 
 as antiques,cooking,handicrafts,health
 etc.,followed by tea and competition. 
    Members go to the Theatre sometimes
 and have a summer excursion.          
    There is a choir whose members join
 in the Carol Concert at Cheltenham    
 every Christmas.                      
    The W.I. raises money to pay for   
 the magazine for the elderly, and     
 members deliver the copies.           
    Money is raised by Sales,and       
 serving teas to visitors.
