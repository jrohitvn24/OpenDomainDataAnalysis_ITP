		<content>Cubs meet every Thursday at 6.30-8.00. 
We have 5 leaders who are called Akela 
(the leader),Rikki,Kaa(who does the    
football training),Harty and Bageera.  
These names are from the Jungle Book,by
Rudyard Kipling. Cubs was founded by   
Baden Powell in 1907. The uniform      
consits of a green jumper(with all your
badges on),black or grey trousers,a red
and yellow neckachief(the colour our   
pack)and a green cap. We can work for  
different badges and we get 5 when we  
join cubs. In the Summer we can do     
soccer practice and we try to get into 
the cubs football team. We train every 
Wednesday night from 6.30 to 8.00. The 
cubs football season starts around     
September and finishes in about May. We
got to the semifinals. We do outings   
and camp at cubs.
