		<content> There is a legend about a beautiful   
 heiress called Lady Sybil who lived at
 Bernshaw Tower.She was extremely      
 gifted and took a delight in the      
 beauty of nature. She longed for      
 supernatural powers and bartered her  
 soul for the gift of witchcraft which 
 enabled her to take any form that she 
 chose,usually that of a beautiful     
 white doe.An admirer was rejected by  
 Lady Sybil. After seeking advice from 
 Mother Helston, a famous witch, he    
 hunted in the gorge of Cliviger and   
 pursued a doe which he finally caught 
 near Eagle Crag.Fastening a leash to  
 its neck he took it home to Hapton    
 Tower where it turned back into Lady  
 Sybil.She renounced witchcraft and    
 married her suitor Lord William but   
 returned to her former ways later on. 
 Eagle Crag is best viewed from Burnley
 Road in Cornholme.                    </content>
