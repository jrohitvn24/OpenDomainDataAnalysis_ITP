 The first Barnburgh and Harlington    
 Village Carnival was held in 1971 to  
 start the raising of funds for the    
 building of the Village Hall. The hall
 was eventually built in 1975 and the  
 Carnival has continued annually .It is
 very much a village affair with all   
 local organisations contributing in   
 their own way, including the village  
 school children for whom an art       
 competition is held every year.       
 Until 1981 the Carnival was held in Mr
 Durdy's field when inclement weather  
 forced it up,to the Village Hall. This
 was so successful that ever since it  
 has been held in the hall and the     
 surrounding area. On Carnival Day     
 traffic is diverted from the centre of
 the 'old' village which is full of    
 stalls and the noisy activity of the  
 villages at play.                     </content>
