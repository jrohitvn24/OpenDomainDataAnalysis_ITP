 The Lynches, in Dean Lane, is an early
 17th.C. house with diaper - patterned 
 brickwork, stone-mullioned windows &amp;  
 rusticated gate-piers. Red brick is   
 the most usual building material for  
 both traditional &amp; modern housing;    
 roofs are generally tiled though some 
 cottages are roofed with slate. Modern
 residential development has augmented 
 the historic layout.{Since 1951}about 
 210 dwellings{(70% increase)}have been
 built,mainly as infilling, replacement
 or in small groups. From information
