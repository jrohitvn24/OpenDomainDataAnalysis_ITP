		<title>10An Inn in S.Clevedon &amp; Kenn</title>
		<content> The Drum &amp; Monkey Inn at Kenn got its 
 name when the son and daughter of two 
 wealthy landowners were married.      
 According to local custom their two   
 coats of arms were combined. In one   
 coat of arms there was a Tudor Rose   
 and the other depicted a monkey. Many 
 people thought the rose was a drum so 
 when the two ere combined the result  
 was the Drum and Monkey. In the last  
 century the pub attracted a huge      
 crowd, including the High Sherrif of  
 Somerset. The occassion was the public
 execution of three men who had set    
 fire to local haystacks. The pub is   
 now very popular with tourists and    
 locals. It has recently been          
 refurbished. The original well under  
 the pub has been restored and is now  
 the focal point of the lounge. It is  
 also said that the inn is haunted by a
 former landlady.                      </content>
