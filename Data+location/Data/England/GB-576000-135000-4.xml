		<content>We interviewed the manager of Barclays 
Bank who's name was Mr Cleary.Mr Cleary
has been in banking since 1951 and has 
been in Cranbrook's Barclays for 8     
years.Banking has changed considerably 
over the past few years by             
computers,cash dispensers,loans,and far
more women are being introduced to the 
state banks.There are three other banks
in Cranbrook.The Midland,National      
Westminster and Lloyds.Most of the     
accounts are of personal accounts      
followed by retail services and farming
and industry,the single most important 
employment is education.Security is    
always a big consideration.The bank    
plays an important part in the         
commercial life of the town.Barclays   
Bank does not feel threatened by       
competition from rival banks or estate 
agents.The bank has quite a few        
children's accounts.                   </content>
