		<content>      The area studied lies on the{    
{Cheshire Plain. }It is a fairly flat  
 area, mainly{agricultural,}with a     
 predominance of dairy farming.  Much  
 of the remaining farmland is devoted  
 to grain, potatoes and managed        
 deciduous woodland.                   
      The land is drained by the       
 Wincham Brook, a tributary of the     
 River Weaver.  Many of the fields have
 ponds, thought to be due to  land     
 subsidence  because of underlying salt
 levels.  The salt towns of Northwich  
 and Winsford are nearby.              
      The villages{Pickmere, Plumley,  
{Lostock Gralam and Wincham,}border the
 agricultural land. {Tabley,}a         
 scattered agricultural village lies in
 the NE corner of the area.            
      Pickmere Lake lies to the west   
 and is a major recreational area.
