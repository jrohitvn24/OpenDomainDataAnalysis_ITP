		<title>01THE CAMBRIDGE SUFFOLK BORDER</title>
		<content> This area of rolling countryside spans
 the valley of the infant Stour. It    
 includes the Suffolk village of Great 
 Bradley and the Cambridgeshire hamlet 
 of Carlton. The district is rural with
 the accent on arable farming. There is
 some pasture on which store cattle are
 fattened. Enlargement of fields has   
 resulted in loss of hedges but the    
 skyline is punctuated by areas of     
 ancient deciduous woodland. At the    
 eastern edge, the outlet of an        
 underground water system debouches    
 into the realigned Stour. Work is     
 provided on local farms and at a large
 family in Carlton which trains, boards
 and exports dogs. Other employment    
 involves commuting to the racing      
 centre of Newmarket, the university   
 city of Cambridge and the modern      
 industrial town of Haverhill. All     
 residents require private transport.  </content>
