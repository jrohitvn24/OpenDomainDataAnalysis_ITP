		<title>18CLUBS IN CURY/GUNWALLOE AREA</title>

        There are no real clubs in the 
 area though some 'club' activities do 
 occur in village halls. There is a    
 village hall in Cury where the Women's
 Institute hold their club meetings.   
 There is also a village hall in the   
 Gunwalloe/Berepper area where the     
 Women's Institute hold their club     
 activities. This latter hall is also  
 used by the younger members of the    
 community for a Youth Club. There is  
 also an 'Old People's Club which makes
 use of this hall. Other clubs are     
 available for use in surrounding      
 areas, both in Holiday sites and      
 adjacent villages and towns. i.e.     
 Helston where there is the Lady Street
 Club and the Godolphin club. There are
 also British Legion Clubs in          
 surrounding areas.
