		<title>18Local Places of Worship</title>
		<content>There are four places of worship in our
area. Trinity United Reform Methodist  
Chapel, and Florence Street Methodist  
Chapel whose Superintendant Minister is
Mr. E Pritchard. He has lay preachers  
to help with the services. Rev. A.Matty
is the vicar of Saint Saviour's C.of E.
church. He has three curates to help   
him. Between 40 and 50 people attend   
church each Sunday. On Tuesdays there  
is a service for Mothers and toddlers. 
Mr. and Mrs. Swansbury are the         
Lieutenants in charge of the Salvation 
Army, they have a few local assistants.
They hold five services during the     
course of a week including childrens'  
group meetings. About 50 people attend 
on Sundays, but as many as 150 go on   
special occasions. I go to their Sunday
School at 1430. We sing, pray and work.
Sometimes they take us out on trips.
