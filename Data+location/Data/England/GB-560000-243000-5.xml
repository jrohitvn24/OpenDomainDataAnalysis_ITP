		<title>05Nosterfield End Farm</title>
		<content> I live on Nosterfield End Farm,as my  
 dad works there.There is a manager,   
 foreman and 1 worker.The farm has 2ooo
 acres .That includes Bumstead .It     
 grows oil seed rape ,wheat,barly ,and 
 peas . It is owned by Hillcourt which 
 is a big company conected with Jaguar 
 cars.Before Hillcourt owned it, there 
 were 3 farms, each owned by one man.  
 Now it is only 1 farm.There are 2     
 tractors, 1 forklift, 2 combines, 1   
 Unimog sprayer.The manager has a car  
 and the forman has a van.Nosterfield  
 End Farm has 550 acres . The crops are
 mostly sold to different buyers. Here 
 is what happens to them. Oil seed rape
 is cut by combines, stored in barns,  
 dried by blowers  and sold 2 weeks    
 after harvest. Spring peas are grown  
 on contract.
