		<title>20Keswick's Mountain Rescue</title>
		<content> The mountain rescue are called out on 
 average sixty times a year.If there is
 somebody unconscious a special machine
 is used that pumps out hot air to     
 revive them.The team consists of about
 forty four men most of them in their  
 fifties.One experience was finding  a 
 little boy at the bottom of           
 Helvellyn.This happened when he and   
 his father were on the top of         
 Helvellyn.The boy wanted a last look  
 at the view so he walked towards the  
 crag.Having no grips he slipped on the
 ice and could not save himself and    
 fell off.On some occasions the        
 mountain rescue have needed the       
 helicopter to rescue people.It is used
 about three times a year on average   
 and it is kept at R.A.F.B.This stands 
 for Royal Air Force Boulmer.
