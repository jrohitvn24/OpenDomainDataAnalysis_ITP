 We interviewed an administrator       
 about Pains Hill Park.                
                                       
 1.   What is going on at Pains Hill?  
                                       
 They are attempting to restore the    
 park  to its 17th. Century state. Some
 things have already been done: the    
 restoration of the cottage and Gothic 
 Temple folly and a new works depot are
 complete. They are also trying to     
 restore the landscape. The lake is    
 being dredged and the site of the     
 Turkish Tent and the Water Wheel are  
 being excavated. Also, the Roman Bath 
 and horse pump are being restored.    
 To do this work they are using        
 volunteer archaeologists and          
 schoolchildren. Sponsors and          
 contractors are also finding work for 
 some local unemployed.                </content>
