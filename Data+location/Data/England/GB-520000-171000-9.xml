		<title>09Wimbledon Common (2)Windmill</title>
		<content>Commander Dean(the Ranger) lives in a  
house joined to the Office near the    
Windmill in the middle of the Common.  
He works 5 days a week from 8.a.m.     
sometimes until 10.p.m. if he is the   
Officer on duty. There are 25 people   
employed by the Conservators, which    
includes 3 keepers on horseback and 2  
on foot, rates collectors and adminis- 
trators and men to maintain the trees  
and ditches. Commander Dean enjoys his 
job even though dealing with Kingston, 
Wandsworth and Merton Coucils, clubs   
and schools using the Common involves a
lot of office work. The Windmill and   
Museum houses an exhibition to show the
history of windmilling in England.     
There have been windmills on Wimbledon 
Common since before 1600 but the       
present one was built around 1817.     
Baden-Powell wrote his book about Boy- 
Scouting while staying there.(cont -)  </content>
