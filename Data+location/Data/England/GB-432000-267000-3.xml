		<title>03OLD FOLK IN LILLINGTON</title>
		<content> Lillington is a suburb of Leamington. 
 Lillington is N.E. of the centre of   
 Leamington.The landscape is flat but  
 part of Lillington borders the Campion
 Hills.There are no large shops,just a 
 square of shops,which includes a Post 
 Office and a laundry.There aren't many
 other shops just the odd ones around  
 the main roads,there are  three       
 churches but most of Lillington is    
 houses.Like Leamington, Lillington has
 some large houses which were once very
 grand.Many of these have been turned  
 into homes for old people but it can  
 cost a lot to live in some of them.   
 There are also some sheltered housing 
 schemes where old people can live in  
 homes of their own, but with a warden 
 nearby to help if needed. They also   
 have a hall where they can eat, play  
 cards or meet friends.
