		<content> My dad works in an electrical shop.   
 Six people work in the shop. In the   
 big room in the back the men mend     
 things like cookers and washing       
 machines. The showroom contains       
 things like washing machines, heaters 
 and toasters. On a Saturday morning   
 I help sort papers telling that Dad   
 paid all the things he bought. My Mum 
 puts the prices on things in the      
 showroom. A lot of time my Dad is     
 called away on jobs far away and we go
 along and eat dinner in the car. I    
 think he is very clever and can do a  
 lot.                                  
   The shop was once a garage. At the  
 back there is a carpark. You can fit  
 13 carsin there. Also there is some   
 junk at the back of the shop.
