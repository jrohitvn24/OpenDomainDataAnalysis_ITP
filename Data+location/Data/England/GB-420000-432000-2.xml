		<title>02THE CIVIC COMPLEX</title>
		<content>    The Civic Complex consists of the  
 Civic Hall,a police station,a fire    
 station,an old peoples' home and some 
 bungalows.It is very convenient with  
 all the main buildings close together 
 and sited near to local transport.    
    The Civic Hall(1972) is used for   
 meetings,conferences,discos,shows and 
 receptions.It has a very big car-park 
 which is sometimes used for driving   
 lessons.                              
    The fire station(1973) is handy,   
 being close to the Ring Road.It has a 
 practice tower behind it.             
    The police station(1978) has cells 
 at the back.                          
    There are lots of bungalows for old
 people who can help themselves.       
    There is an old peoples' home on   
 Richmond Road where old people go when
 they cannot cope for themselves any   
 longer.                               </content>
