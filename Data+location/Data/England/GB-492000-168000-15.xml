		<content> The main Police Station of this area  
 is Bracknell.Ascot is considered a    
 small station.During Royal Ascot week 
 however the station is very busy.It   
 was specially designed to cope with   
 law and order during race meetings.   
 During Royal Ascot Week 250 men are   
 stationed here and this is their      
 headquarters.They set up rooms to     
 control the race meetings from here.  
 The most important man during this    
 time is Chief Constable Mr. Colin     
 Smith. The usual crimes that are dealt
 with during that week are petty fights
 over betting and drunkeness.
