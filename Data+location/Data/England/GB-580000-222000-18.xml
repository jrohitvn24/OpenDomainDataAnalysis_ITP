		<title>18GHOST STORY</title>
		<content>{*}When we came back from holiday,Tom, 
 our neighbour,told us this story:     
                                       
  "We were in bed when I heard a       
 chopping noise coming from your       
 lounge.I didn't think much about it   
 and tried to get to sleep.The chopping
 noise didn't stop,so I went downstairs
 and then round to your house to see   
 what was going on.I looked into your  
 lounge and saw {an axe}lying on the   
 floor.It frightened me a little,at    
 first,but then I thought you must have
 left it there by accident."           
                                       
{* We hadn't.                          
{                                      
       After Tom told us this I was    
  frightened,although I don't think    
 about it any more.                    
{* We still don't know how the axe got 
{into the lounge.}                     </content>
