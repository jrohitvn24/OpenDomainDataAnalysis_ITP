		<title>07Beswick &amp; Watton C.E. School</title>
		<content> The school is situated on the A164    
 between Beswick and Watton, close to  
 the Kilnwick crossroads. It provides  
 education for children from 4+ to 11+ 
 years. In September 1985 there will be
 25 children on roll - 14 Infants and  
 11 Juniors. There are 2.1 teaching    
 staff, including Head Teacher, and    
 five part-time ancillary staff.       
 Low numbers have threatened the       
 school's continued existence for      
 several years. A closure attempt was  
 defeated in 1977 on the retirement of 
 the then Head Teacher. Numbers have   
 averaged around 28 since then, peaking
 at about 35 and dropping to 21 at one 
 time. Projected figures indicate that 
 present trends will continue over the 
 next few years.                       
 Kilnwick supplies the majority of the 
 present school population, Beswick and
 Watton contributing smaller numbers.  </content>
