		<title>14THE PUB AT NEWTON.</title>
		<content> The Egon Ronay listed Red Lion is a   
 popular venue for meals throughout    
 South Lincolnshire and beyond.The     
 owners bought the pub by exchanging   
 the hire purchase payment on a sports 
 car to the mortgage payment on the    
 property.The rooms are low-ceilinged  
 and are furnished with old cottage    
 furniture and interesting local items 
 which have been collected by the      
 landlord and his wife.A Squash Club   
 has been added and draws most of its  
 members from Sleaford and Grantham    
 areas.From the pub a great many events
 are organised every year:discos;barn  
 dances;barbecues;treasure hunts;      
 bonfire and Christmas parties.Some of 
 the proceeds and special raffles held 
 by the landlord benefit the village   
 funds.
