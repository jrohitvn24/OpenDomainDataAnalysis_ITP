		<content> We use tools to help in our  home life
 in many ways in the garden we use     
 electric, hand powered and petrol     
 mowers.For longer gardens we use small
 tractors.The new hover mowers are also
 popular. For wood work we use planes, 
 electric drills,electric sanders,     
 power and chain saws and surforms as  
 well as traditional tools.We have many
 tools in the kitchen to help us       
 prepare food.We use blenders, electric
 knives, toasters, gas and electric    
 cookers with hoods to get rid of      
 unwanted smells. We use special tools 
 to service our cars. Some people do   
 their own repairs using jacks,        
 spanners and airpumps for punctures,  
 screw drivers, electric drills,       
 welding torches, pressure gauges, and 
 spray guns.
