		<content>  The railway is operated by a group of
 enthusiasts as a tourist attraction.At
 the moment the track runs from        
 Havenstreet to Wootton but the Company
 has plans to reopen the line between  
{Havenstreet and Smallbrook}where the  
 British Rail trains still run.The plan
 includes an interchange at Smallbrook.
  The trackbed is leased from the      
 County for Â£1000 p.a. As a first step 
 the undergrowth is being cleared.This 
 work is being undertaken by a group   
 called Community Task Force. There    
 are 72 people in the group which is   
 paid for by the{Manpower Services     
{Commission}as part of the Government's
 plan to provide work for the          
 unemployed.They hope to have a further
 contract in 1986 to clean the ballast.
  The farmer at Whitefield is not so   
 keen as the railway cuts his farm in  
 two.                                  </content>
