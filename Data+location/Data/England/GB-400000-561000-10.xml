		<content>          The Railway.                 
 Riding Mill station is one of the     
 oldest surviving passenger stations in
 the world. The line between Blaydon   
 and Hexham was opened on 9th March    
 1835. Two steam locomotives left      
 Blaydon, Stephenson's "Rapid" and     
 Hawthorn's "Comet". The seventeen mile
 journey took two hours forty-five     
 minutes, due to some problems but the 
 return journey only took one hour and 
 ten minutes. After that four regular  
 passenger trains a day ran between    
 Blaydon and Hexham.                   
 Today diesel trains run from Newcastle
 to Carlisle through Riding Mill. The  
 journey to Riding Mill takes          
 thirty-five minutes and costs Â£1.00.  
 The old station master's house is now 
 lived in by the school caretaker and  
 the ticket office is an elderly       
 person's flat.                        </content>
