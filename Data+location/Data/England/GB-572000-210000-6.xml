		<title>06FARMING BOREHAM NORTH</title>
		<content> There are a number of farms in the    
 area, three of which were visited.    
 Stocks Farm,one of a group,has soil   
 that is a mixture of clay and         
 gravel,is used for growing the        
 following crops. Winter Wheat,        
 Potatoes, Sugar-beet, Winter Barley   
 and Oil_seed-rape. The latter having  
 become popular in this area during the
 last few years. It was grown in the   
 North of England,but was prone to     
 disease. At present it is disease free
 here.Grain is sold to the government  
 through the invention scheme, and     
 beans are grown under contract to     
 Batchelors, who dry them and sell them
 abroad, mostly to America, a good     
 market for dried foods.               
 The farmer said he was brought up on a
 farm, and loves the life. He would not
 consider doing anything other than    
 farming.                              </content>
