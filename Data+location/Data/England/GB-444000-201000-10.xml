		<title>10Local Government in Wootton</title>
		<content>     Local government is conducted at 3
 levels: County, District  and  Parish.
 County  and  District  Councillors are
 elected  on  political grounds, and at
 present  belong to the Alliance party.
 The  Parish Council consists of people
 well known to the community:the chair-
 man used to be headmaster of the local
 school.  Parish  Councillors  are  not
 chosen for their political views.     
      We  interviewed  the local County
 Councillor,  who  is  also  a district
 councillor  for another area.  He told
 us  that  the main responsibilities of
 the  County  Council are education,the
 social  services,  highways, structure
 planning, public transport,the police,
 the  fire-service  and  libraries. The
 District  Council  is  responsible for
 housing, leisure, footpaths and roads.
 The main concern at the moment is that
 a good bus service should be preserved</content>
