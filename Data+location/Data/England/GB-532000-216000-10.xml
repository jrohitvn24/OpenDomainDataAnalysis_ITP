		<title>10ECOLOGY in WESTMILL</title>
		<content>When the sand and gravel has been      
worked out a large hole about 30metres 
deep remains. It is the responsibility 
of the company to fill this in and     
reconstitute the land back to farming  
use. Landfill undertaken by the company
in this area involves filling in the   
holes with factory waste, building     
rubble and household refuse, anything  
as long as it is not liquid,hazardous  
waste which would poison the ground    
water. A thick layer of good topsoil is
added and the land is sown with grass. 
This area is then grazed by sheep. Then
an arable crop can be sown and after   
five years the gravel company can sell 
the reclaimed land back to the farmer. 
At Westmill, mature trees around the   
workings remain which effectively      
screen them from the attractive        
countryside.
