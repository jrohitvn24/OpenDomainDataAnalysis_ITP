<title>21Highfield Humanities College</title>
<content>

Our school was built in 1933, as Highfield High School, then a seperate girls and boys school.  It was amalgamated to form one school, and in 2004 became a Specialist Humanities College and changed its name as above.&lt;br />&lt;br />We were very lucky to get through the Building Schools for the Future programme in 2009/10 and we will have a brand new school built on our existing site opening in September 2012.  The school will be slightly larger than the one we are in now catering for 1216 pupils.  We are working with a company called The Eric Wright Group as our school will be a PFI project, which means that we work with this company for the next 25 years who will own and maintain our buildings.  The building is very modrn and has no corridors, and was voted one of the best new designs by CABE.  Both the staff and students are really excited and looking forward to moving into our new school.   &lt;br />
