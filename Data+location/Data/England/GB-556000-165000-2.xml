		<title>02GENERAL INTRODUCTION FAWKHAM</title>
		<content>In years gone by this Parish in the    
valley of Fawkhsm was a hop-growing    
area but owing to disease hop farming  
was discontinued.  Even today hops can 
still be found growing wild in         
hedgerows.  This is a very old area    
with a history of beautiful old Manor  
Houses, lovely parklands and old woods.
Most of the Manor houses have been     
redeveloped and the area is now purely 
woods, rouugh scrubland and grazing    
land.  Some farms have a few cowsd or  
shbut small new private developmentds  
are springing up over the parish,      
sadly,diversified, a sign of changed   
times, but still at its heart, is the  
old village green with a find but very 
ancient hostelry "The Rising Sun" mine 
host and his knowledgeable wife Sue and
Joe Bradbnury relegate you with the    
history of the hostelery since l656.
