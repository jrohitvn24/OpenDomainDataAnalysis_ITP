		<title>08THE FARMING YEAR 1</title>
		<content> The farm labour force usually consists
 of the husband, wife and older        
 children. There is little casual      
 labour as in the past, though at busy 
 times, such as hay-timing, local      
 youngsters from the village are hired.
 Contracters may undertake some        
 specialised work (e.g. hedging,       
 siloing) at busy times. In winter     
 (January,February) the cows, kept     
 inside, must be milked and fed on     
 proven and hay. The stirks (young     
 stock)and sheep are outside and need  
 extra food especially in bad weather. 
 In spring (March,April) the cows are  
 let out and the farmer is busy with   
 hedge-laying and muck-speading as well
 as coping with lambing-time. Early    
 summer (May, June) sees him fencing   
 and siloing and attending to cows     
 calving. Calving continues throughout
