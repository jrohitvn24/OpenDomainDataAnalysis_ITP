		<content> On Saturday I woke up at 8.00 a.m.    
 I had 'Weetabix' for my breakfast.Then
 I waited for Alison to come and play. 
 When she did, Mum and Dad said that we
 had to go to Paignton, and we asked   
 Alison if she would like to come.She  
 said she would.                       
 On the way there, we looked out of the
 back windows of the car and waved at  
 people.                               
 Then Mum got out and did some         
 shopping, while Dad went into 'Tesco' 
 and bought some cat food..            
 Then we went home and we had salad for
 dinner, then we went outside to       
 play.Then Alison went home.           
 Then I had my tea and sandwiches.I    
 watched "Wonderwoman" on T.V..        
 At9.00p.m. I went to bed. Before I    
 went to sleep I read a book           
 called"Hurrah,the Circus."
