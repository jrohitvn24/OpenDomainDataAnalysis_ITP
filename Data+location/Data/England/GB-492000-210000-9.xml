		<title>09Interview with Mr.Grace</title>
		<content>    The next question we asked him was,
 "Was there anything on the school     
 grounds before it was built?"His      
 answer was, "Well, no it was an       
 agricultural field and where the      
 church is near Faversham close was all
 one big field."                       
    Finally we asked him "How long has 
 Tring Market been going on for?" He   
 answerd, "Well the Market charter was 
 given by Edward III.The charter was   
 given at Kings Langley when there     
 was a Royal Palace there. Then the    
 market fell into the hands of the     
 Archbishop of Canterbury who was      
 rather hard on Tring and used to      
 charge very high tolls.Eventually a   
 new market charter was given by       
 Charles 2nd in about 1680."
