		<title>11The dismantled railway</title>
		<content> There was an old railway in our area  
 called the{Somerset and Dorset}Joint  
 Railway.It started running in about   
 the 1880's,and stopped in 1966.Along  
 the railway line,there still remains  
 a few{pill boxes.}It went through Mid-
 somer Norton and the Chilcompton area.
 There is an old tunnel that has been  
 blocked off.The lane that runs over it
 is called{"Tunnel Lane".}Some of the  
 line is owned by a farmer who keeps   
 cows on it.In a lot of places the     
 cutting has been filled in.It was     
 commonly used by people going to the  
{South Coast}from{Liverpool}and{Man-   
{chester.}There are banks along the    
 edge and where rails used to be there 
 are now stones.At the end of the line 
 where the tunnel is, there is now a   
{rifle range.}People nowadays go       
{walking}and{blackberry picking}along  
 the old line.                         </content>
