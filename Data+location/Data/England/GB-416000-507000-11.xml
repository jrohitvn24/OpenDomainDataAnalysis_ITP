		<title>11MELSONBY-The Village School</title>
		<content>  The history of the village school    
 begins in{1757}with{Wm. Cockin}who by 
 a{Deed of Endowment}gave the{annual   
{income from the rent of land}to cover 
 the costs of{a Master &amp; rented room   
 for{the instruction of 6 poor children
 of Melsonby Parish in{reading, writing
{and the common rules of arithmetic.   
  In{1863}the{National School}(later   
 C.ofE. School) was rebuilt at the     
 expense of the{Rector Rev. W. Ellison.
 This school remained in use until its 
 closure in 1959 when the{pupils were  
{transferred to}the{Methodist School . 
  The{Methodist School}was{built}in    
{1857}at a{cost}of approximately{Â£740. 
  The school population as remained at 
 about 40 for some years now in spite  
 of the increase in size of the village
 (in 1890 there were 100 pupils at the 
 Methodist School alone!). Children    
 over 11 years now go to Richmond.     </content>
