		<title>09CHELTENHAM NURSERIES</title>
		<content>{CHELTENHAM }has always been renowned  
 for its floral displays in parks and  
 gardens and along the roads and       
 streets. This year it won the Britain 
 in Bloom competition. The most        
 attractive town. The Parks Dept.      
 Nurseries occupy a site of 18 acres.  
 There are 10 large glasshouses and    
 here they grow all the flowers and    
 plants for the parks,gardens,traffic  
 islands and public buildings in the   
 town. All the greenhouses are         
 different for the conditions required 
 for each plant. The gardens are       
 changed 2 or 3 times a year and at    
 peak times, 80 men are employed in    
 preparing and planting. It cost       
 Â£20,000 a year just to repair gardens 
 that are vandalised. The whole project
 costs a great deal of money but it is 
 thought to be worth it to attract     
 tourists to the town.                 </content>
