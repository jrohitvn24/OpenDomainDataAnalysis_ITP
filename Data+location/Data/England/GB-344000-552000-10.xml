		<title>10Glassworks in a castle cont.</title>
		<content>   The two men we spoke started this   
 cottage industry because by starting  
 their own business they are able to do
 some work and make a living.          
   One of the really clever things that
 they did was to make coloured paper   
 weights.They put the rods of colour in
 the glass while it is still hot and   
 they can make it look as if there are 
 flowers or crystals in side a solid   
 piece of glass.Glass can be made into 
 the same size and shape by blowing    
 into a mould. When the glass is still 
 quite hot it is rolled and cut or     
 allowed to bend to make additional    
 shapes.                               
   The men told us that they do not    
 make their own glass but reheat broken
 glass. When they are working they sit 
 on their chairs and all they wear is a
 vest and a pair of shorts. It is very 
 hot and you need a lot of puff.       </content>
