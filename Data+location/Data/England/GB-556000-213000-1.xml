		<content> The most important feature in our     
 area is the agriculture. The majority 
 of the land is arable farm land. The  
 main crops being wheat,barley,oil-seed
 rape and potatoes. There are a few    
 fruit farms. The land is flat and the 
 fields are separated by hedges and    
 ditches. Small copses break up the    
 landscape.                            
 There are small residential areas. The
 largest ones being at Leaden Roding   
 and White Roding. There are several   
 15th and 16th Century thatched        
 cottages.                             
 The area has only a small interest in 
 industry, however this may alter with 
 the development of Stansted Airport.  
 Many of the people are employed on the
 land ,however a lot of people also    
 commute,travelling to Harlow,         
 Chelmsford and even to London.
