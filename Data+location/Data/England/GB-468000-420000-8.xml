 On our farm we have about 620 pigs. We
 have three folds and two pig          
 buildings. There are five boars and   
 all the rest are gilts. The boars mate
 all the gilts and the gilts are put   
 into pens. They eventually have about 
 ten pigs. After they have pigged they 
 are called sows. When the pigs are    
 about two days old they have their    
 teeth and tails cut off. The gilts    
 have pig nuts night and morning. The  
 pigs that are out in the other unit   
 go for pork or bacon at twelve weeks  
 old.
