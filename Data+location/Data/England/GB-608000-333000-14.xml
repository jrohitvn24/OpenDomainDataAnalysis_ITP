		<title>14TRANSPORT IN EDGEFIELD</title>
		<content> Transport, or rather the lack of it,  
 affects many aspects of village life. 
 One can travel to Norwich by bus to   
 fit in with a normal working day, but 
 nobody from Edgefield can work in Holt
 Sheringham or Cromer without some form
 of private transport. This            
 particularly affects the young as they
 cannot get jobs without a car, and    
 cannot afford a car until they have a 
 job. If they want entertainment in the
 evening, there is a bus to Cromer, but
 none to come home again. More         
 seriously those relying on public     
 transport can only reach the doctor on
 Tuesdays and Fridays. Young mothers   
 must learn to drive. The elderly must 
 rely on the kindness of their         
 neighbours. Fortunately more private  
 services are starting with the needs  
 of local communities in mind. The bus 
 from Aldborough goes through to Holt. </content>
