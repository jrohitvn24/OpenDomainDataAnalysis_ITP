		<title>16ANGMERING PARK STUD FARM</title>
		<content> The stud farm was formed and built in 
 1937 and it belongs to Lavinia,       
 Duchess of Norfolk.  There are 46     
 horses on the farm, all thoroughbreds.
                                       
 The farm covers 240 acres and has 19  
 paddocks.  Five people work on the    
 farm.  They bring up the horses and   
 train them until they are 18 months   
 old.  It costs Â£64 to provide for one 
 horse for one week.  On average 14    
 foals are born each year and trained  
 as racehorses.  When the horses are   
 old enough some of them are sold to   
 foreign countries - Japan, USA,       
 Ireland, Australia, France and        
 Germany.  There have been some famous 
 horses born and bred on the stud farm.
 The mare 'Fotheringay' who is now 22  
 yars old bore a foal worth Â£750,000   
 which will be named when it is 2 years
 old.                                  </content>
