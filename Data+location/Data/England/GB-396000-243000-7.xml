 "60 years ago as a girl, living on the
 farm next to the school, I would help 
 to load the produce, cabbage etc. on  
 to the horse and dray and take it to  
 the railway sidings at Charlton. There
 were no lorries going through the     
 village and I could bowl my hoop from 
 one end of the village street to the  
 other. In Summer, we would spin our   
 tops all the way up the street."

 "I have lived here 61 years. Horses   
 were used to pull the plough and help 
 with the work on the farm. When I left
 school all the boys, in my class,     
 except two, went to work on the land.
