		<title>03BURGH CASTLE</title>
		<content> The walls of the Romano-British fort  
 (Gariannonym) at Burgh Castle stand,in
 an impressive state of repair,        
 overlooking the marshlands of the     
 Waveney valley.Built of local flint   
 and tiles they stand tall,bounded by  
 circular watch towers.The wooden      
 superstructure has long since         
 decayed,but whether the absent West   
 wall ever existed or has suffered a   
 similar fate is not known. Three walls
 enclose the site which has been       
 extensively excavated but is now an   
 arable field.Details and finds are    
 displayed in the Castle Museum        
 Norwich.Just visible within the walls 
 are the remains of a Norman castle    
 motte.The situation of Gariannonym is 
 explained by the fact that it once    
 looked over a shallow sea towards     
 Caister, where another Roman site may 
 be found.                             </content>
