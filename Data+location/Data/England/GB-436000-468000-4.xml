		<content> On the 20th of June 1985 Daniel and I 
 went and asked Kevin for his view     
 about the RAF planes flying over Kirby
 Hill. He said that it disturbs him    
 when he goes to sleep, planes also    
 disturb him when  he is playing games 
 and when he looks at one flying in the
 suns rays, it hurts his eyes. he also 
 says when he looks at one while riding
 his bike he crashes! We talked to Mrs 
 Benson about the planes that come     
 over. She complains bitterly about    
 them. She rings up their base to sens 
 them the other way. When she was      
 teaching, the children ducked under   
 the tables when a bomber came over. It
 scares her when a plane flies low over
 her house.
