Our village has got a lot of .Our      
village has got several buildings one  
of which is the church.It was built in 
1851,and is very well kept inside.We   
have a chapel,which a lot of activities
are conected to.We have one shop in the
whole of the village.The only really   
big disadvantage is that most things   
there are very expensive.We have a     
Conservative Club next door to the     
chapel.We also have got a pub called   
the Rose and Crown which is just down  
the road from the club.The school in   
Hartwell has children ageing from 4 to 
11.We have roughly 180 children in the 
school.In Ashton school there are only 
about 25 children in the whole school. 
In our village we have got a nice view 
of the forest but we also have the M1  
motorway which is noisy and dirty.
