		<title>16COMMUNICATION FROM THE WORLD</title>
		<content> Communication in the time of William  
 the Conqueror was very slow and very  
 expensive.Today everything is         
 DIFFERENT.                            
 News and Information come to us by    
 means of gossip,Parish Magazine,      
 Newsletters from Village Groups(often 
 delivered by our school),local and    
 National Newspapers.Most homes have   
 the Telephone,radio and Television.   
 The Telephone connects across the     
 nations by wire and microwave link    
 and across the oceans along with T.V. 
 by space satellite.                   
  It is now possible to be in almost   
 instant contact with many places      
 around the world and at really a very 
 small cost.All of this has made our   
 world seem a very much smaller place. 
 We have sent satellites to the        
 farthest parts of our system and they 
 have sent information back to us.     </content>
