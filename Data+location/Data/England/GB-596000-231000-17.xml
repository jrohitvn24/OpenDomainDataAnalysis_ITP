		<title>17GT.HORKESLEY CHURCH</title>
		<content> All Saints Church,Gt.Horkesley was    
 built in the 12th century as a        
 Chapel_of_Ease for the Nayland Church.
 A chancel,a vestry,the Lady Chapel and
 the tower was built in the 14th       
 century.In the 15th century the North 
 Aisle was built and the tower was     
 added to.                             
  As the Church is at the northern end 
 of the village,it is some distance    
 from the main housing area and so St. 
 John's Church was built at the end of 
 the 19th century at the southern end  
 of the village.Some Services are still
 held every Sunday at All Saints. The  
 local school children visit the church
 to study its history and on one Sunday
 in July a special School Service is   
 held.Although most people are cremated
 when they die the graveyard is still  
 used for burials and there is a new   
 area with recent graves.              </content>
