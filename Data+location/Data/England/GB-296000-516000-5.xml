		<title>05HENSINGHAM POST OFFICE.</title>
		<content> The sub-post office in Hensingham     
 village is run by Mr and Mrs.         
 Taylor.They live above the post office
 which also has a small grocery        
 buisness looked after by Mrs.Taylor.Mr
 Taylor sells about 500 stamps a day,  
 Â£5 being the highest value stamp he   
 sells.The post office opens from      
 9.00am until 5.30pm.There are two     
 employees but Mr and Mrs.Taylor clean 
 the shop themselves.We visited the    
 General Post Office in Whitehaven to  
 compare the two.                      
 The main difference between the two is
 that a sub-post master is self-       
 employed and is paid for the work he  
 does.A general post master has a set  
 wage. G.P.O. or Crown P.O. can supply 
 people with passports,Vehicle Licences
 and Excursion Documents.All P.O.'s    
 have a Girobank which is the same as a
 normal bank.                          </content>
