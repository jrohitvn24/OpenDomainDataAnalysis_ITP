 minutes to eight and have  Cornflakes 
 for breakfast. I go upstairs clean my 
 teeth ,go to school arriving at       
 quarter to nine. At five past nine we 
 have assembly followed by Maths for   
 one hour. We have break till eleven o'
 clock where we play football. I have  
 English at eleven, stop at school for 
 lunch and then usually enjoy a nice   
 game of cricket with my friends.      
 After dinner we have History then a   
 twenty minute break before we have    
 Games. We finish school at quarter to 
 four ,I have my tea and then go       
 straight out to play golf, just to

 nine and have a quiet read for half an
 hour.
