		<content> Linkenholt has a bus service everyday 
 but Sunday; it is provided by a       
 private company, Parnham's of         
 Ludgershall. The bus arrives at 8.00am
 and 4.30pm daily. These buses are used
 also to take the children to and from 
 school. On Tuesday, Thursday and      
 Saturday there is also a 9.30am and a 
 1.45pm bus.                           
 Since the teachers' dispute, Andover  
 schools have closed early, so that the
 childrens' bus now comes home at      
 3.00pm.                               
 For the past year the bus company has 
 been running at a big loss and it is  
 thought that there will be changes in 
 the system.                           
 Faccombe has only 1 bus service on one
 day a week, - Saturday.               
 Most families have one private car and
 some young men own motor bikes.
