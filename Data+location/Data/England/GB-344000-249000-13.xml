		<title>13CANON PYON'S ROADS-70yrs.AGO</title>
		<content> A local man remembers that 70yrs. ago 
 the roads were very dusty in summer   
 and very muddy in winter.They were not
 tarmac-surfaced but made by rolling   
 small,evenly sized lumps of stone with
 a steam-roller.One member of the road 
 gang was a specialist who{'knapped'}  
 stones into the right size.Each parish
 in the area was responsible for       
 providing roadmaking stone.Quarried on
 Westhope Hill it was left in piles at 
 the roadside ready for use.The main   
 road (A4110) was much narrower than   
 today.There were very few{cars }and   
 people came out to see them when they 
 passed by.Until the coming of{Yeoman's
{bus service,}started in Canon Pyon by 
 our informant's family,people relied  
 on{carrier's carts}to carry them and  
 their goods. The carriers even did    
 shopping to order often delivering the
 goods as late as midnight!            </content>
