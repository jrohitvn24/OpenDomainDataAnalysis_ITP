		<title>03The OLD LANTERN Public House</title>
		<content> The{"Old Lantern"}is situated in      
 the village of Martin and is owned by 
{Christine Carr,}who has been the      
 Landlady for nine years.   She        
 previously owned a betting shop in    
 London.   There is a large garden with
 tables and chairs and a purpose built 
 playhouse for children.   Mrs Carr    
 says that her clientele come from as  
 far away as Ramsgate, Broadstairs and 
 Hythe, and that few villagers use the 
 pub.    She employs nineteen employees
 on a part-time rota, including kitchen
 staff and she also cooks.   The       
 opening hours are from 10.30am to     
 2.30pm and from 6.30pm to 11pm on     
 Mondays to Saturdays and on Sundays   
 from 12pm to 2pm and 7pm to 10.30pm.  
 Bitter beer is the most popular drink 
 sold here.   There is one bar.
