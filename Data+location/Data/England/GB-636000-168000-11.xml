		<title>11    Questionaire</title>
		<content>    A questionaire about life in       
 Margate was sent to each family in    
 Drapers Mill. We received 210         
 responses.                            
    Some of the questions were about   
 housing. 82% live in semi-detached or 
 terraced.                             
    25% said their home was built      
 before the First World War, 29% said  
 between the Wars, 31% said post Second
 World War and 15% live in housing     
 built in the last 10 years.           
    We asked about possessions. 68%    
 have one or more cars and 89% one or  
 more bicycles. 36% have one television
 whilst 60% have more than one, 37%    
 possess a computer and 51% a video.   
    74% keep pets, most popular being a
 cat, but there were several somewhat  
 strange pets mentioned, such as       
 chickens, ponies, geese, a goat,      
 ducks, frogs and 82 stick insects!    </content>
