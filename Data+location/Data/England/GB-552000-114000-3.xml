		<content> In 1953, East Hoathly had a           
 Blacksmith. The farmers used horses to
 plough the fields. Today, there is a  
 Stud but no Blacksmith. The old       
 Rectory had a metal gate at its       
 entrance which was on the main road,  
 where the recreation ground is today. 
 A new Rectory and Rectory Cloae with  
 its 22 houses have been built in its  
 garden. Church Marks Lane was the     
 allotments. Buttsfield Lane had a     
 Chapel which has been demolished.     
 The Butcher, Grocer and Baker used to 
 deliver daily by van. People walked or
 biked to work. They had two buses an  
 hour each way from 7.00a.m. to        
 10.00p.m.
