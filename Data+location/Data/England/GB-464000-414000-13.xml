 ALTHOUGH THEY HAVE TO TRAVEL AN       
 AVERAGE DISTANCE OF 4.1 KILOMETRES TO 
 VISIT THEIR DOCTOR AND 5.6 KILOMETRES 
 TO A DENTIST AND THE NEAREST          
 SUPERMARKET IS 6 MILES AWAY, MOST     
 PEOPLE WOULD NOT EXCHANGE THEIR RURAL 
 EXISTENCE FOR THAT OF A TOWN. A WEEKLY
 VISIT TO AN OPEN MARKET AND A         
 SUPERMARKET IS NORMAL FOR MOST
