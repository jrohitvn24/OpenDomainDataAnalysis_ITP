 Reading, Alder Valley and Reading     
 Transport. These buses are very       
 distinctive because the Alder Valley  
 ones are completely red or red and    
 white. Reading Transport on the other 
 hand have maroon and white so you can 
 never get them muddled up. The Alder  
 Valley type are normally single decker
 but they have some double decker      
 buses. Reading Transport are always   
 double deckered. Both of them are     
 driver operated. Reading Transport    
 provides buses in the borough .There  
 are a few buses that go to the        
 Caversham Park area, 51, 52 and 53.   
 The 24 goes to Emmer Green. The fares 
 from Caversham Park to the centre of  
 Reading are 14p for children and 30p  
 for adults. The buses run about every 
 15 minutes. Alder Valley provides     
 country buses to Sonning and Henley.  </content>
