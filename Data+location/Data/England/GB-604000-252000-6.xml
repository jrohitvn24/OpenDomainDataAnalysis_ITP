		<content>Barking Police.                        
                                       
First mention of the police in 1892    
when George Sage was listed as         
constable.                             
The old police station was next to the 
village school and is now called The   
Grange.                                
In the 1930's a new police station was 
built near  the garage.  This has      
recently been sold as a private house. 
For about the last ten years policing  
the village has been done by a team    
instead of the old fashioned village   
bobby.                                 
The last village bobby was P.C. Hunn   
who recently retired in 1984.
