		<title>12The 3 churches of Ousden</title>
		<content> There are 3 places of worship in the  
 village. The church dedicated to St   
 Peter is a tri-partite Norman         
 building. Although there have been    
 later additions some Norman features  
 remain. The rector is also rector of  
 the nearby villages of Lydgate and    
 Cowlinge and resident in Lydgate. A   
 lay elder, assistant lives in Ousden. 
 The congregation numbers around 12 and
 work is done to raise funds to keep   
 the church fabric in good repair. The 
 surrounding churchyard ceased to be   
 used for burials in 1912, when a new  
 cemetary was opened. The cemetery     
 chapel of St Barnabas was built at    
 about this time. The Methodist chapel 
 built in 1872 replaceing the old barn 
 at Dunstall Green has a congregation  
 of 8. There is no resident minister as
 it is part of the Newmarket curcuit,  
 who supply a minister when required.  </content>
