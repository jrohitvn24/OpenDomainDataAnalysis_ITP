		<title>17TRADE: BARGES AT GRAVESEND</title>
		<content>{Barges}are an important part of the   
 river traffic at Gravesend.  At       
{Crawley's Wharf}there are 6 barges.   
 Two barges supply water to shipping   
 for drinking and general domestic use 
 and other barges deliver oil between  
 depots and supply oil to ships. The   
{barges}operate on the{River Thames    
 within port limits and on the{River   
{Medway}as far as Aylesford.  The      
 barges are based at Gravesend but can 
 be moored as far apart as Woowich on  
 the Thames, and Strood on the         
 Medway. The men work 7 days a week.   
 Their hours of work depends on the    
 tides as the Thames at Gravesend is   
 tidal.
