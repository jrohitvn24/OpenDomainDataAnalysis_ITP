		<title>10CLITHEROE'S RECREATION AREA</title>
		<content>    The Roefield and Edisford Bridge   
 district is one of the most popular   
 areas of Clitheroe both for           
 townspeople and visitors.             
   Here there is to be found an indoor 
 swimming pool which was opened in     
 1972. Since then further amenities    
 have been added. These include a pitch
 and putt course, children's           
 playground, a caravan and camping     
 site, football pitches, and more      
 recently the Barn has been converted  
 for recreational use.                 
    A model railway has been added at  
 Roefield providing rides for visitors 
 at weekends.                          
    The banks of the river at Edisford 
 are very popular during summer. Here  
 visitors can stroll along  or sit     
 and laze on the forms that are to be  
 found there. In summer the cafe is a  
 popular place for the visitors .      </content>
