		<title>19LUNCHTIME SURVEY AT A PUB.</title>
		<content>  The landlord said that they did not  
 have many lunchtime customers because 
 of the drink-drive law.               
  Of the handful of people who were at 
 the Cottage,only three were local.The 
 locals went in two or three times a   
 week.One traveller said he called in  
 "sometimes",another 3 times a month.  
 The reasons they gave for choosing the
 Cottage were:(i) it was local;(ii)they
 served good food;and (iii)because it  
 was near to work.                     
  The most popular lunch was ham, egg  
 and chips.This cost them Â£1.30.       
  There was a computer operator,2 who  
 worked in the motortrade and a company
 manager. There was a retired lady too.
  They drank cider and lager,shandy and
 straight lager and bitter.            
  Some of them had their food and drink
 in the beer garden.                   
  The landlady cooked the meals.       </content>
