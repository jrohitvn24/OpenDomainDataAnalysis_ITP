		<title>20MAYOR OF MAIDSTONE</title>
		<content> Mrs Rosemary Graham was elected one of
 three Labour councillors to represent 
 Parkwood and Senacre on the Maidstone 
 Borough Council. She has become       
 particularly interested in people who 
 need houses, attends meetings on their
 behalf, and tries to get houses built 
 where they are needed. She also deals 
 with roads and transport matters. A   
 councillor, she points out, is not    
 paid. Her husband was also a          
 councillor. Previously she was a      
 Dental Receptionist and also worked   
 for the Navy. She is a great believer 
 in equality. She would like to have   
 been a writer, but has this year been 
 elected Mayor of Maidstone.           
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
