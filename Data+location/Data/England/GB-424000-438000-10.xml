		<title>10A Day In My Life</title>
		<content> At 7.15 a.m. I get up, get washed and 
 then wake my Mum up. Then I put my    
 uniform on, grey clothes and a tie    
 with red and black stripes. After that
 I go downstairs and have my breakfast 
 of Frosties. I have toast as well.    
 After that I go to school with my     
 friend Paul. School starts at five to 
 nine. On Monday morning we do maths   
 and at playtime I play "Tig-1,2,3".   
 You start by seeing who is on, then   
 the person who is on counts up to a   
 hundred and whilst he is doing it the 
 other people hide. Then he looks for  
 them. After play we watch "Zig Zag" on
 television and then talk and write    
 about it. After dinner we write a poem
 and go home at 3.30. Later I have my  
 tea, then I go on my cycling          
 proficiency course. When I get back I 
 go to bed.                            
                                       </content>
