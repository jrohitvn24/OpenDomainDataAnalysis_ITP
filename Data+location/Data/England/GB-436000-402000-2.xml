		<title>02BANK END SCHOOL</title>
		<content> THERE ARE 6 PRIMARY, 1 SECONDARY AND 1
 SPECIAL SCHOOLS IN THE AREA. OURS AT  
 BANK END WAS BUILT IN THE LATE 195O'S 
 ON WHAT USED TO BE TENNIS COURTS AND  
 BOWLING GREENS, BUT IT WASN'T         
 OFFICIALLY OPENED UNTIL 1966. IT HAS  
 NOW 3 INFANT AND 4 JUNIOR CLASSES AND 
 CHILDREN FROM 4+ TO 11+ YEARS ARE     
 TAUGHT. A NURSERY WAS ADDED IN 1976   
 AND IT TAKES AROUND 4O CHILDREN IN TWO
 SESSIONS EACH DAY. ALTOGETHER, THERE  
 ARE 213 CHILDREN ON ROLL. THERE IS A  
 HEADMASTER, NINE TEACHERS, A NURSERY  
 ASSISTANT AND 13 ANCILLARY STAFF. WE  
 HAVE ALL THE USUAL LESSONS BUT WE ARE 
 VERY LUCKY IN HAVING A GOOD PARENT    
 TEACHERS ASSOCIATION WHICH HAS        
 PROVIDED THE SCHOOL WITH A BUS TO SEAT
 3O CHILDREN, A LEARNER SWIMMING POOL, 
 A MUSIC CENTRE, EQUIPMENT FOR AN      
 ADVENTURE PLAYGROUND AND LOTS OF OTHER
 SMALLER ITEMS.                        </content>
