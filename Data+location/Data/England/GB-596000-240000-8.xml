This is about the soft toys            
Miss Osborne makes.  Miss Osborne has  
been making soft toys for 19 years now.
She makes them to sell and most of the 
money goes towards Boxford Church, she 
gets the material from factories and   
people is the village.  She makes her  
own patterns and designs.  The material
she uses makes the toys look so        
life-like.  To make them sometimes she 
uses a sewing machine but most of it is
done by hand.  It takes between a day  
to a week, depending upon the size of  
the toy.  She makes all kinds of soft  
toys.  She makes teddys and animals    
such as dogs, hedgehogs, cats, bears,  
badgers, lions, tigers, foxes, monkeys,
frogs and snakes.
