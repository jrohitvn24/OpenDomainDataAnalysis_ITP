		<title>07Buxton:Teenage comments</title>
		<content> The weather is sometimes fairly warm  
 in summer, although it is cold in     
 winter. The town is fairly old,       
 although there are some new           
 developments.Tourists provide a source
 of income but are also a nuisance due 
 to litter and occasional overcrowding.
 The facilities for teenagers vary,    
 e.g., youth clubs, recreation areas,  
 swimming baths. In summer there are   
 train rides and crazy golf. There is a
 cinema. Most children hang around the 
 parks and the streets because there is
 nothing really interesting to do.     
 Buxton could do with a night club or  
 more regular discos. For some people a
 BMX track would be an added           
 attraction.
