		<title>15School Log Book</title>
		<content>    Our first school log book          
 (Osmondthorpe Primary School) records 
 school life from 1929 to 1956 and many
 events are recorded.   They show us   
 how our school has changed over the   
 years.   However, we have only chosen 
 a few entries made between 1939 and   
 1945 all of which refer to the 2nd.   
 World War.   They tell us something   
 about what life was like in our school
 at that time.                         
                                       
{29th.June 1939}                       
    I (E.M.Carratt) and two assistant  
 teachers left school this afternoon to
 attend an air raid precaution meeting.
{24th. July 1939 }Rehearsals for       
 evcuation took place on the morning of
 the 20th. July and the afternoon of   
 23rd. July.
