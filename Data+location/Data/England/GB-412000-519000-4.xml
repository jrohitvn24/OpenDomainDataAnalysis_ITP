 -ions blend with existing housing.    
 After World War 1 a few private houses
 and council houses were built but in  
 the inter-war period there was not a  
 great deal of building.               
 In 1947 Sudburn Avenue was built and  
 by 1951 there were 370 private houses 
 in the village. Coronation gardens was
 built in 1953 and since then          
 development has taken place to the    
 west ans south east of the village.   
 Both council and private housing has  
 been stone built and much effort has  
 been made to make new housing fit in  
 with existing homes, St Gregory Close 
 being one of the few exceptions. A    
 walk through the village will bear out
 the success of this policy.
