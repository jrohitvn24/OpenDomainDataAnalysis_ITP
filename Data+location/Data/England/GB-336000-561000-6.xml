		<content>The area is served by one church; the  
Parish Church of Blackford dedicated to
St. John the Baptist. This Vicar of    
this parish is also the vicar of the   
Parish of Rockcliffe and even with this
economy the church finds itself in     
financial difficulties. Families of    
denominations other than Church of     
England have to travel in order to     
attend their own services. The vicar   
attends the school as part of his      
parochial duties and takes the morning 
Assembly on Wednesdays throughout the  
term.
