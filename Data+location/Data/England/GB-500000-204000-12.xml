		<title>12Grand Union Canal</title>
		<content> the canal was built about 180 years   
 ago to carry goods to and from London 
 and the Midlands. However with the    
 growth of road and rail transport this
 use has largely died out and the canal
 is now given over to a variety of     
 leisure activities. During the summer 
 many people hire converted narrow     
 boats for cruising holidays. We spoke 
 to a family on one of these boats and 
 they had travelled down from Runcorn  
 on the River Mersey on their boat.    
 There is beside the canal a small     
 boatyard that converts boats into     
 pleasure cruisers. Fishing is very    
 popular and a yearly ticket is issued 
 by the London Angling Society for     
 parts of the canal. In addition old   
 gravel workings by the canal have been
 flooded to make lakes owned by local  
 fishing clubs. People also enjoy just 
 walking on the towpath.               </content>
