		<content>{Mr.John Dann}has known{Blackboys}for  
 just over 50 years.                   
 "People grew their own vegetables and 
 had allotments. Today most buy their  
 food in shops.There used to be a queue
 for allotments,now over half in       
 Blackboys are unused. Public houses,  
 which used to be for local villager,  
 are now bars with restaurants catering
 for outside visitors.Gun farm,which   
 used to sell beer to local workers,is 
 now a sports club with a bar.         
     Bus routes have reduced as routes 
 have been cut.One route which used to 
 run every two hours to local towns,now
 only runs on schooldays and is a      
 shorter service. Few people now work  
 in the village-most people go away to 
 work.A few men work on building jobs  
 for "Shoesmiths" and some on local    
 farms".  (Mary Sell,Maria Hunt,Neil
