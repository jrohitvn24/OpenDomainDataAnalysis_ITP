		<title>20Dorchester Show</title>
		<content> This show is held annually in early   
{September.}It started in 1840 and has 
 taken place in{Came Park}for several  
 years. Approximately 25000 people went
 in 1984, so it is presumed that a     
 similar number will attend in 1985.   
 It is mainly an agricultural show     
 which local farmers and the general   
 public attend for both business and   
 pleasure. There are classes in which  
 fatstock animals are shown and judged;
 exhibitions of the latest equipment;  
 and a horticultural section containing
 miniature gardens, flowers, shrubs and
 prize vegetables. There are also rural
 arts and craft stalls but one of the  
 main attractions is the showjumping.  
 It costs Â£2.50 for an adult to visit  
 the show and Â£2.00 for a child or a   
 pensioner. There are some reductions  
 after 3.00pm.
