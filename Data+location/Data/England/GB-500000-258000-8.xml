		<title>08Roadverge Nature Reserves.</title>
		<content> There are over 2,500 acres of road    
 verges in Bedfordshire providing      
 habitats for a wide range of wildlife 
 including birds,mammals,butterflies   
 and reptiles.They are often important 
 for flowers,particularly as           
 Bedfordshire has few flower-rich      
 meadows left.The verges have species  
 which are now uncommon in the         
 surrounding countryside.The most      
 important of these verges have been   
 identified by the County Wildlife     
 Trust and one such area occurs along  
 the sides of the Sharnbrook to        
 Thurleigh road.The County Council is  
 responsible for the management of the 
 road verges.With their co-operation   
 this Nature Reserve has been marked   
 with posts and an 'NR' sign to try to 
 ensure protection from dumping and    
 damage from pipe-laying or road works.
