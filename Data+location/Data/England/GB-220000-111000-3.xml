		<content> My sister and I took part in the "Acid
 Rain Project",  run by the Watch Trust
 for Environmental Education Ltd.      
                                       
 We recorded the  acidity of  rain  and
 snow in our  garden between  Jan  14th
 and Feb  10th  1985.    We checked the
 quantity  of  rainfall  in  a  sterile
 container  and  used  ph  sticks    to
 measure the acidity.  The lowest level
 of acidity that we recorded was {3.6ph
 A total of 8,000  children  around the
 country took part and the results were
 analyzed  by  Dr. Neil Cape   of   the
 Institute of Terrestrial Ecology.     
                                       
 This goes to prove  that our isolation
 is no guarantee of  immunity from this
 ecological problem.
