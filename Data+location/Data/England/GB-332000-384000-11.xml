		<title>11 ROCK FERRY COUNCIL ESTATE</title>
		<content> We live on the{Woodward Road Council  
{Estate, Rock Ferry. }The houses are   
 quite old but have been renovated     
 recently.  They are{semi-detached.    
 We have a front and back garden.  We  
 have five empty  houses on our estate,
 Which have been boarded up.  On the   
 estate there is a small{playground. } 
 It has no swings, they were taken down
 because they were dangerous, but it   
 has a slide and a bridge to climb.  We
 also have a lot of people around, most
 of them are my friends.  My two       
{grandmothers}live in my road.  They   
 always sit in or outside our house.   
 An{ice-cream van}comes round twice a  
 day and I always get one.  We have a  
 local shop but the prices are high.   
 We also have a{chip shop}and a{betting
{shop.    }
