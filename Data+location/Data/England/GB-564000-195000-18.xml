		<content>{A Day in the Life of a Schoolchild.   
   I am woken up at 7.15am, put on my  
 school uniform and after a breakfast  
 of cereal and toast, there is an      
 opportunity to watch early morning    
 TV.                                   
   When we get to school the boys play 
 football in the playground, but I and 
 some of my friends go to{recorder     
 practice before assembly. The mornings
 are taken up with lessons, but some   
 classes travel by coach to the local  
{swimming pool.}We have a short        
 playtime half way through the morning.
   Many of us take a packed lunch to   
 school but others, who wish to pay,   
 may have a school dinner. Lessons,    
 including art, games and PE, take     
 place in the afternoon.               
   When I get home I watch TV whilst   
 drinking tea and eating crisps. In the
 evening I watch more TV until 9.00pm. </content>
