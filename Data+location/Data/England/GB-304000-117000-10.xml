		<title>10HOUSING</title>
		<content> Most of the houses around here are in 
 very good condition.People generally  
 spend quite a lot of time and trouble 
 keeping their houses looking          
 nice.There are some thatched houses   
 but most of them now have slates on   
 the roofs.There are only a few cob{   
{(mud)}houses in this area.This is     
 unusual for Devon.We think that this  
 must be because of all the quarries   
 which are nearby.In Westleigh and     
 Burlescombe there are some new houses.
 In Westleigh thee is quite a large    
 estate of houses.However in Holcombe  
 Rogus,very little building is allowed 
 because the water supply will not     
 cope,so apart from a few houses and   
 bungalows everything in Holcombe,     
 Staple Cross and Hockworthy is all    
 old.Tourists often are really         
 surprised to find Holcombe Rogus.They 
 think that it looks so quaint.        </content>
