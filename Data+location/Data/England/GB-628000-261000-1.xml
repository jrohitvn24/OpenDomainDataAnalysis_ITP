		<content>   Framlingham is a small market town  
in Suffolk surrounded by countryside.  
It is mainly arable land with several  
farms. Framlingham has many good       
shops, enough for itself and the area  
around. It also has three schools, a   
primary school, a comprehensive school 
and a public school,Framlingham        
College. It has attractions including  
a 12th Cent. castle and an impressive  
church. For the many visitors there are
places to stay, the largest is the     
Crown Hotel. The population is around  
2,300, with many pleasant people.      
Framlingham is 19 miles north of       
Ipswich. There is a market on          
Saturdays. We have a fire station with 
its own crew of part-time  firemen.    
There is a police station with its own 
sergeant and 4 constables. The nearest 
hospital is in Ipswich but there is a  
modern surgery with three doctors.     </content>
