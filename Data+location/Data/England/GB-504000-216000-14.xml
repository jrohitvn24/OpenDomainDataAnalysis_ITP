		<content>            {JUDO CLUB                 
 In Markyate there is a Judo Club that 
 meets in the Community Hall on        
 Pickford Hill every Tuesday night at  
 8.15 till 9.15.Firstly we put the mat 
 up.It's like a small square mat,then  
 we put rectangular mats round it in a 
 spiral. Then we lay a thick canvas    
 over the top.Firstly we do warming up 
 exercises then we practice a          
 particular throw or a hold and the    
 teacher corrects us. Sometimes we play
 games.We have a competition between   
 ourselves each week. You have to be   
 over the age of 5 to join.It costs 65p
 a week and Â£5 a year membership. There
 is grading every 6 months and big     
 competitions quite often.To take part 
 you need a Judo suit or you can use a 
 tracksuit and bare feet.
