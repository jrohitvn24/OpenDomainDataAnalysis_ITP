 I interviewed a 92 year old man.He    
 said he remembered when he was at     
 school with clean black boots and     
 girls with clean starched pinafores.He
 had a whiptop,a small wooden top with 
 an iron spike in the spinning end.They
 did not have any homework from school 
 but plenty at home like cleaning shoes
 for the next day and folding up       
 clothes.He moved to Stratford and did 
 not have so far to walk to school,but 
 as they were getting older the lessons
 were getting harder.He could get a    
 hair cut for one shilling.Then he     
 moved to Warwick School,and if he did 
 not have homework,he was kept busy    
 with weeding or hoeing at home.
