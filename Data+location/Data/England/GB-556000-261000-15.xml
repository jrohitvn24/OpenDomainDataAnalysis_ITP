 opens for Sunday school and Bible     
 Study which last until 11.30.am. The  
 Sunday school is for children and the

 nights there is a service for adults  
 but children can go as well. At this  
 service is a preacher who tells a     
 story and you sing hymns and say      
 prayers as well. On Thursday evenings,
 from 6.15.pm. until about 8.30.pm. a  
 group called 'The Sun Seekers'meet. At
 this meeting games, singing and       
 prayers play an important part.       
 Refreshments of squash and biscuits   
 are also provided. Bible Study is also
 on the agenda. Lots of visits are     
 arranged for this group, such as going
 to the sea-side,camping and walks. The
 group is well supported and very much 
 enjoyed.
