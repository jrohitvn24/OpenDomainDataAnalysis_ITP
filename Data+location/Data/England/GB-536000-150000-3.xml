		<title>03Oxted Chalkpit.</title>
		<content> The Chalkpits are in the hills called 
 the{North Downs,}above Oxted. You can 
 see it all white, cut out of the green
 grass, from a long way away. How long 
 it has been there nobody is sure. One 
 day the men dug out so much that the  
 road, called Chalkpit Road collapsed, 
 and they had to make a new road.      
 When the chalk has been dug out it is 
 taken by lorry to be loaded into big  
 round kilns which are still there.    
 The chalk is heated up to turn it into
 lime (in a big metal shed). The lime  
 is soaked with water. Then it is      
 dried, crushed up into powder, put    
 into bags and taken away in lorries.  
 In the old days it went by train which
 ran at the back of my Granny's garden.
 Long ago the Chalkpit and the School  
 land were covered by sea.{Fossils}have
 been found in the Chalkpit and at     
 School. By Tim Widdowson aged 6 years.</content>
