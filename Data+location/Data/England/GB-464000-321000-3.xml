		<content> There are 93 ewes with their 188      
 lambs.Mark has just built a sheep pen 
 in the field ready to hold the sheep  
 for shearing.The wool is taken from   
 the sheep once a year, usually in May 
 or June. The lambs will be sent to the
 market next Autumn. Mrs. Hyslop looks 
 after the cade lambs. These lambs are 
 from ewes which have had 3 lambs and  
 can only look after 2 of them. The    
 cade lambs are fed by bottle.         
 Mark is mowing the grass this June    
 ready to make into silage. The grass  
 is allowed to dry in the sun. It is   
 then chopped into small pieces and    
 blown into trailers.It is then put    
 into a heap or clamp and sealed down. 
 This will provide next winter's feed  
 for the cattle and sheep.             
 The farm also grows 25 acres of wheat.
 The corn is sold and the straw is used
 for animal bedding in the winter.     </content>
