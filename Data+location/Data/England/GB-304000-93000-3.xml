 Marsh Green is a village without a    
 shop,church or school.It used to      
 have all of these and a post office   
 but they are all closed down now.Most 
 of them have been converted into      
 houses.Also there used to be a        
 Smithy.The old school was not in Marsh
 Green but was at a crossroads just    
 outside the village and served several
 smaller places as well.It is now a    
 Bingo Hall and voting place.Marsh     
 Green goes back quite a long way as   
 there is a house in the village which 
 is about 500 years old.Also a memorial
 in the centre of the village names    
 people who died in both World Wars and
  some of the same familys still live  
 in the village.There is one farm in   
 Marsh Green and most of the           
 surrounding area is farmland.Some of  </content>
