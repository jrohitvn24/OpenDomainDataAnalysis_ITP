		<content> Mr.Jakes told us that the Chapel is   
 used most Sundays but there is no     
 longer a Sunday School. The Service at
 quarter to three and is part of the { 
{Littleport Circuit}This means a       
 Littleport Minister administers the   
 Service. Some weeks it is a lay       
 preacher. The Congregation{tends to be
{elderly}with at least six attending.  
 The Chapels in the Village take turns 
 to celebrate particular Services. For 
 instance one year the Carol Service   
 for the Golden Link (over 60's        
 Club) would be done by us then the    
 Baptist Chapel would do it the next   
 year.                                 
 The Chapel is not normaly hired out   
 for use and there is only an          
 occasional week day meeting.{Children}
 can come with their parents and       
 sometimes to help there is a morning  
 service.                              </content>
