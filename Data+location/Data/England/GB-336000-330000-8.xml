		<content>  Eating  patterns  have  changed since
 the last war for a number  of reasons.
 Farmers no longer  separate  their own
 cream  and thus  much  less  cream  is
 consumed. The  traditional  fatty  pig
 has  lost  favour,  while  ducks, free
 range  chickens  and  rabbits   are no
 longer  kept  on  the  farm. Now  most
 farmers' wives  shop for eggs and meat
 like  the rest of  us. Old habits such
 as  ferreting and shooting for the pot
 have largely disappeared and pheasants
 and  partriges  have declined with the
 removal of hedges and scrub. Thus most
 now eat less  meat than in  days  gone
 by. Bottling of vegetables  and  fruit
 has been replaced  by freezing  and so
 gardeners are less  bothered  about  a
 regular supply  of  food  through  the
 year. Country  wines  and home brewing
 are still popular  although farmers no
 longer brew for the harvesters.       </content>
