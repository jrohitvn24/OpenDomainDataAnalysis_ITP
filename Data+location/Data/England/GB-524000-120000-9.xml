		<content> Children are either Infants (5-7) or  
 Juniors (7-11).  Infants all work in  
 the Infants room.  Lower Juniors and  
 Upper Juniors are divided between the 
 Head and the 5/10 teacher every       
 morning for basic subjects.  All      
 Juniors come together in one room with
 the Head every afternoon for music,   
 drama, art, creative writing, sports  
 and project work.                     
 There is a real family atmosphere,    
 parents, grandparents and friends     
 constantly visit and help in classes. 
 Every child is treated as an          
 individual; modern, progressive and   
 non-authoritarian teaching methods are
 used. the school has teachers visiting
 from other schools to observe maths   
 being taught and in 1985 we won the   
 Sussex Rural Community Council shield 
 for our environmental project work.
