I went for my first tennis lesson at   
Boxford,it was really good and I       
enjoyed it.On Monday I went for a walk 
with my dad and Anton.We saw the       
bluebells.After dinner we all went for 
a walk to Homey Bridge,but Anton and I 
went on our bikes.After tea we watched 
television,then went to bed.

On Saturday in the morning Daddy and I 
went into Hadleigh to my friend's house
to give him his birthday present,a     
Jungle Book tape.He had a Sony Walkman 
from his parents.We had a game of darts
and a game of cricket.After lunch we   
had a bike ride to the ford,Boxford    
and Stone Street and did something for 
the bike test.Mummy bought me a smart  
new track suit.Then I went to a        
swimming gala against Britannia.       </content>
