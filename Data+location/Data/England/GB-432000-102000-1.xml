		<title>01New Forest-Introduction</title>
		<content> The predominant land cover for this   
 area of the New Forest is woodland.   
 This consists of mixed conifers and   
 deciduous trees. Moorland begins to   
 the south and north-east.             
 This area is available for tourism and
 leisure. Car parks and a camp site    
 exist at various locations providing a
 base from which to walk through the   
 forest on the many pathways and gravel
 roads and observe the plant and animal
 life. Within this area is a small     
 restricted zone for deer research.    
 However it is possible to see deer    
 throughout the area.                  
 The main London to Bournemouth railway
 line crosses this area and provides   
 the opportunity for train spotting.   
 Much evidence of Forestry can be seen 
 in this woodland area including       
 felling of trees and reafforestation.
