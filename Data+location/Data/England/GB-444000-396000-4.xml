		<content> Treacle can have as many players as   
 you like.  You need a small ball, a   
 king, a queen, and a jack.  The king  
 puts his arm out and drops the ball.  
 If the ball touches your leg or shoe  
 that is called a trea touch, but if   
 the ball goes through your legs you   
 are on.  When you are on you have to  
 hit somebody with the ball.  When the 
 ball has gone through your legs the   
 king, queen and jack can stay.  When  
 you hit somebody with the ball then   
 they have to move.  When you have got 
 everybody except one boy or girl, he  
 or she is the king.  The second to    
 last person is the queen and the third
 to last person is the jack.
