		<title>08A CHILD'S DAY</title>
		<content> On this special Saturday I did lots of
 things ranging from helping to paint  
 the garage to watching nearly 8 hours 
 of television. The programmes I       
 watched ranged from Captain Scarlet to
 Dynasty. I watched 5 programmes, 2    
 films and 1 video film. When I had    
 some spare time between programmes I  
 read a book in the living room. After 
 dinner I spent half an hour helping my
 Mum to paint the garage door white.   
 Afterwards, late in the afternoon I   
 watched two films consecutively. The  
 first was called Battle beyond the    
 Stars on ITV at 5.00 p.m. and the     
 second The Fantastic Journey on BBC 1 
 at 7.00 p.m. I ended the day with fish
 and chips then played in my room.     
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
