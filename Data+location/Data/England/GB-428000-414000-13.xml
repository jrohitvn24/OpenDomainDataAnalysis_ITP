		<content> The Chemic Painthorpe got its name    
 from the industries in the area in the
 18th century. In 1841 Painthorpe was  
 the centre of the local clay fire and 
 terra cotta works.Fire and clay was   
 worked by open cast methods in pits.  
 The brickworks tramway extended to the
 Calder and Heble Navigation Canal near
 Broad Cut Low Lock Calder Grove the   
 Crigglestone clay and fire company    
 changed hands several times before    
 closing in 1887.The only evidence to  
 be seen in 1985 of this industry is   
 three concrete posts where the shafts 
 used to be in a field at the end of   
 Daw Green Lane.
