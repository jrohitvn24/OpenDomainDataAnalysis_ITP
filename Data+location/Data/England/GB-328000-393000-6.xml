		<content> THE PROMENADE:The prom. at New        
 Brighton goes right along the River   
 Mersey and the estuary.  People walk  
 along this and, sometimes, it is very 
 full.  At one place near the sea there
 is an amusement arcade where the pier 
 used to be.  There is a pool seperated
 from the river by a wall where people 
 can sail boats.  The river is very    
 dirty and nobody swims there.  (K.    
 SQUIRE (10). THE TOWER GROUNDS: New   
 Brighton once had a tower and a       
 ballroom but these have gone.  The    
 tower grounds are now an open area of 
 grass and trees leading to the prom.  
 Lots of people go there to play on    
 swings, walk their dogs or play       
 football.  Children play with their   
 BMX bikes on the ramps that have been 
 built there.  Sometimes you can find  
 pieces of the tower if you look very  
 hard.   ( N.PARRY (10))               </content>
