		<content> IMPRESSIONS OF THE AIRFIELD ESTATE    
 -                                     
 The bus route around this area isn't  
 very good because it isn't very       
 regular and there is only one bus.    
 Round one estate there was only one   
 telephone box and no post boxes.  The 
 telephone box was very far away as    
 well.  There were no post offices     
 either for about a mile.  I thought   
 the area we looked at was very crammed
 together.  The houses looked very     
 small and there were a lot of short   
 roads.
