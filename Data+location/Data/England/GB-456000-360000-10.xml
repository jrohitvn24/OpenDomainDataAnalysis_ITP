		<content>      Forest Town is a town near       
 Mansfield. There are a lot of shops   
 where we live. On Violet Hill there is
 a tool hire called C.P.M. Tool Hire.  
 It hires out tractors, diggers and    
 caterpillars. Up the road is a Hyper  
 market called Tesco a hypermarket is  
 a supermarket with its own car park.  
 There is a Garden Centre at Tesco.

 kitchens. Also in Forest Town there is
 a carpet shop which sells carpets,    
 mats and rugs.
