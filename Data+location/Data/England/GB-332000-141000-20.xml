		<title>20WHY ANOTHER SURVEY?</title>
		<content>   During the course of this project we
 have been able to explore in some     
 detail the villages and surrounding   
 countryside in which we live,much of  
 which we take for granted.A study of  
 this kind helps us to appreciate how  
 lucky we are to live in such a        
 pleasant rural environment.           
   We wish to thank everyone who has   
 contributed material and taken time   
 off from their work to talk to us.    
 Special thanks must be given to the   
 staff of the Royal Ordinance Factory  
 for the tour of their facility.
