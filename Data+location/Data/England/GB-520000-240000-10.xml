		<title>10TRANSPORT IN HINXWORTH AREA</title>
		<content> Transport in the area is dominated by 
 the private car. The major A1 (London 
 to Edinburgh) trunk route allows      
 rapid access to north and south, and  
 is a significant factor in enabling   
 people to live in rural surroundings  
 whilst working considerable distances 
 away, even in London. As there is     
 almost no employment in the area the  
 car (or in some cases the motorbike)  
 is essential in enabling people to get
 to work. Some of the elderly do not   
 have a car; for them life here can be 
 very awkward as public transport is   
 mimimal. The bus service is a twice   
 weekly return trip to Biggleswade,    
 necessary, as we don't have any local 
 shops. All the children have bicycles 
 for fun and some adults have cycles   
 for pleasure and fitness. There is one
 electric bicycle in the village which 
 is considered to be a novelty.        </content>
