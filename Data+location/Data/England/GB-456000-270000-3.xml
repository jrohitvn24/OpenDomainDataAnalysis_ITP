		<title>03THE INDUSTRIAL ESTATE</title>
		<content>   Very close to Junction 18 on the M1 
 Motorway on the western edge of the   
 village of Crick there is a small     
 Industrial Estate. Presently this site
 is occupied by 9 companies, 7 of which
 are concerned with Warehousing/       
 Transport/Distribution, 1 warehouse   
 for bicycles and the last concerned   
 with computer systems and services.   
 The types of goods being distributed  
 are parts for Volvo cars, household   
 textiles, food for a major retail     
 company - Tesco, ceramic tiles and two
 firms just involved in transporting   
 any goods. The total number of people 
 from Crick that work at the Industrial
 Estate is 66. These warehouses are in 
 Crick because of the location on the  
 M1. On the M1 we can go north, south  
 and to the east and the west.
