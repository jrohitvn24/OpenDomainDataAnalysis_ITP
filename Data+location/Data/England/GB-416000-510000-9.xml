		<content>   The earthworks  known as the { Scots
{Dyke}and which  extend from the  river
{Swale at Richmond}to the river{Tees at
{Barforth }are  visible  near Stanwick.
 They  are  believed to be  part of the
 same defensive system as the {Stanwick
{Camp  eathworks,} their  mounds  being
 known  as  {"Jack-dike  Arches".}  The
 nearby{beck}known as {Jack-dike Ditch 
 was renamed the {Mary Wild Beck}after,
 it is believed,  Mary Wild  who became
 the wife of Anthony Catterick owner of
 the manor and lands of Stanwick in the
 early 1600's.                         
   Archaeology  students  from{  Durham
{University} are  just  completing  the
 final year  of a  four year excavation
 programme  of  the  inner part  of the
 earthworks  near  the  ice house.  The
 work   is   being   done   under   the
 supervision of{Mr Percival Turnbull.
