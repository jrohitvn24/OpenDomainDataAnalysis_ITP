		<content>    At Linslade Middle School we play  
 lots of different playground games.   
 One of these is "Witches in the       
 Gluepot".One person is the witch and  
 they have to catch someone and put    
 them in the gluepot. Once you are in  
 the gluepot you must wait until the   
 others, who are not the witch, tig    
 (touch) you, then you can get out of  
 the gluepot. Once you have been       
 caught three times you are the witch. 
    Another of the games is "Pom In".  
 In this game you must get to the post 
 before the person who is "It" tigs    
 you. This is a rhyme you say to see   
 who is "It":"Ibble Obble, Black       
 Bobble, Ibble Obble, OUT!" To do this 
 rhyme, you stand in a circle and go   
 around the players in turn. Whoever   
 lands on "OUT" is not "It". You keep  
 going until you are left with one     
 person who is "It".                   </content>
