		<content> At the present time, major roadworks  
 are under way to alleviate the        
 congestion at the{Army and Navy       
 roundabout, the major bottle neck on  
 the{A12.}The work is being carried out
 by the Cementation Company.The road is
 to be 14\km long, with 5 interchanges.
 There will be 5km of side road works, 
 with a further 5km of farmers' access 
 tracks where fields have been cut off 
 from the main farm land. They will    
 move 2 million cubic metres of soil   
 during the operation and install 100  
 km of drainage. It is to be a dual    
 carriageway made of concrete. There   
 will be 19 structures, mainly bridges.
 The work started in July 1984 and     
 should finish in Oct. 1986.Of the 200 
 people employed, many are local. Key  
 men on the staff are the "nomads of   
 the mid 80's" and live in caravans    
 on the site, behind a mound of soil.  </content>
