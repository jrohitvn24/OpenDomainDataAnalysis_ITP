		<title>14Landscape of St. Agnes</title>
		<content> Basically this area presents a rural  
 landscape with bleak and rugged       
 scenery in parts.  There is a decided 
 lack of trees - which is apparent when
 visiting the south coast.  There, the 
 landscape is much softer.             
 Dotted about the landscape are relics 
 of the more prosperous tin-mining days
 in St. Agnes - old engine houses, mine
 stacks, and remains of the workings   
 from the mines.                       
 In the distance may be seen the rugged
 cliffs that abound with heather and   
 lichen.  During the spring, broom and 
 gorse also adorn the hedgerows making 
 a blaze of bright yellow.             
 The highest hill is The Beacon, at St.
 Agnes, which stands 650 feet above sea
 level.  This was chosen as one of the 
 principal stations in the Great       
 Trigonometrical Survey.  The 'trig    
 point' can be seen clearly from afar. </content>
