		<title>09TUMBLE TYE FARM CAPEL</title>
		<content>   Tumble Tye is a mixed dairy and     
 arable farm with two hundred Frisian  
 cows and two hundred calves a year.We 
 visited the farm to watch the cows    
 being milked.Each milking parlour     
 holds 24 cows.First the teats are     
 cleaned then the milking machine is   
 attached. Each cow is milked twice a  
 day.The best cows give 18 litres a    
 day, the milk is kept cool in a huge  
 refrigerated tub until the tanker     
 arrives.                              
   In summer the cows graze but in the 
 winter they are fed on silage that has
 been stored from the summer.Cows      
 usually live for 7 years.             
   Half of the farm's land is under    
 grass,the other half is used for      
 wheat,barley,maize and beans.
