 other schools entered too.Once        
 everybody was there a man said that we
 had to do two problems in one hour.The
 first problem was to support the      
 plastic button as far off the ground  
 as possible using only the materials  
 provided.We were provided with 24     
 straws and 10 pipe cleaners.The second
 problem was to make a support from the
 card provided which will  hold the    
 plastic button{20cm above}the ground  
 and{40cm horizontally}from the centre 
 of the support.For that problem we    
 were provided with card and scissors  
 and sellotape.When the time was up the
 man judged them. Desmond,Lucy and I   
 were amazed to find that we had won.We
 would go on to the{County Finals at
