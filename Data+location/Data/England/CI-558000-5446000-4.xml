		<title>04A DAY AT ST. AUBIN'S FORT</title>
		<content> We stayed at the fort recently, we got
 up at 7 o'clock and went down to the  
 open air sinks for a wash. Then we    
 had breakfast: cornflakes followed by 
 bacon and egg.  We split into groups  
 for work sessions. We might work in   
 the classroom to learn about the      
 history of the fort or we might go out
 onto the rocks to look at rock pools  
 or collect shells. One group prepared 
 lunch of sandwiches and crisps, we all
 sat on the gunsite to eat it. In the  
 afternoon the tide had uncovered the  
 causeway and we could all walk over to
 the land side for more lessons. After 
 dinner we  wrote our diary and        
 then had some time for games or       
 to listen to tapes. We got into the   
 bunkbeds at 9:30 and then the         
 generator was turned off and it all   
 went dark, and quiet... then sleep.
