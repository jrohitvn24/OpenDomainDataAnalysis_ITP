		<content>    In the past it used to be very     
 quiet, there were never any fights or 
 vandalism, everyone used to be well   
 behaved, there were never any strikes.
    There was no television so a lot of
 people listened to the radio. Apart   
 from listening to the radio people    
 spent more time in sports.            
    You could travel to Oxford and     
 back for just 5p. A bar of chocolate  
 cost only 1p and a loaf of bread 4p.  
    At Christmas time more parties were
 held and families would get together. 
    The poor people would pay 6p for   
 the bakers to cook their Sundoy meal. 
    Abingdon was very small. It was a  
 beauty spot. On market day it was very
 active, lorries came from everywhere  
 to bring food.                        
    In Abingdon everyone knew everyone 
 else. The population in Abingdon used 
 to be 9000, today it is 30,000.       </content>
