		<title>01INTRO. TO BUCKHURST HILL</title>
		<content> This block is divided into three      
 residential areas : Buckhurst         
 Hill,Chigwell and Woodford. These     
 areas are very similar.They are       
 middle-class suburbs of London.Because
 of this similarity we use the name    
 Buckhurst Hill to cover the whole     
 area.Hence,the title Police In        
 Buckhurst Hill refers to police in all
 of the block.                         
 Physically, the block is divided in   
 two by the R. Roding running north to 
 south.To the west of the river is     
 mostly wasteland except for           
 Chigwell.It is the area to the east   
 which is of most interest.Here are    
 most of the shops and small           
 industry.(There is no heavy industry  
 in this area).The eastern half of the 
 block is nearly all housing apart from
 patches of Forest land.
