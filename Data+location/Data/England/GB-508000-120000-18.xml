		<content>   Old farms and houses are sometimes  
 named from obvious landmarks, but more
 often after early tenants.  The origin
 of Gay Street and Gaywood may be John 
 de Gaynesford, who made tax returns in
 the early 14th century. Harbolets is a
 diminutive of Herbert; the old house  
 replaces a 14th C farm.  Horelands may
 derive from Hollands, as there was a  
 de Hollande.    Saucelands probably   
 derives from Galpho Sauce, who paid   
 tax in 1296.                          
 The most likely theory for the name   
 'Blue Idol' arises because pieces of  
 blue porcelain, undoubtedly old, were 
 dug up there. These may have come from
 a statue of the Virgin Mary, as the   
 area was staunchly Catholic.          
 Several farmers use the Sussex dialect
 word 'rew' when talking of a hedge cum
 ditch.     See "A Dictionary of the   
 Sussex Dialect" by Helena Hall (1981).</content>
