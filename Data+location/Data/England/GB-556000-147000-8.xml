		<title>08THE OAST TONBRIDGE:2 PLAYS</title>
		<content>  The theatre was full of all age      
 groups_a varied audience.Seats are Â£2,
 or Â£1.25 for members.There were two   
 75 minute plays _{Man of Destiny}_ by 
 G.Bernard Shaw,about Napoleon Bona-   
 parte,set in an Italian inn,around    
 1796.{The Real Inspector Hound},by Tom
 Stoppard followed.This was a spoof of 
 an Agatha Christie "Who dunnit?"      
 thriller set in Muldoon Manor,cut off 
 from the world by fog,with a murderer 
 on the loose.A corpse lies unnoticed  
 by the sofa.The plot thickens when one
 of two critics from the audience      
 answers a telephone call on stage from
 his wife and involves himself in the  
 action.In the final scene both critics
 are shot and the real Inspector Hound 
 reveals himself as another minor      
 failed critic.This is comedy:when it  
 is played seriously it seems so absurd
 that it is humorous.                  </content>
