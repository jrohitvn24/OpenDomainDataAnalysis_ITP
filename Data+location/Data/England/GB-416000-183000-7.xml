		<title>07PARK SOUTH EAST SWINDON</title>
		<content> In Park South shopping area there is a
 stone showing that the centre was     
 built in 1962.Tere is a school which  
 has a main building and huts.The      
{church}is by the block of six         
 houses.At the back is a big garden.The
 lake has a{waterfall,grass,trees and a
{park}around it.Including the school   
 there are two play areas.Down the road
 from Queens Drive Church is the       
{community centre.                     
 I thought the Park South area was     
{tatty}.The shopping centre is big but 
 tatty,there is{graffiti}all over the  
 windows and walls.The area is{closed  
{in}and{scruffy}.The roads are long and
{narrow}and the gardens are very       
{small}.Some houses are neat because   
 they have been bought and you have    
 permission to add extra walls and     
 porches.
