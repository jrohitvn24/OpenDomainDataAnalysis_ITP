		<title>15RECREATION IN MARSKE AREA.</title>
		<content> The leisure activities of this rural  
 area are many and varied: Farmers go  
 pheasant and grouse shooting using    
 their own gun dogs. The pheasants are 
 mostly hand reared, then released to  
 shoot. There are quite a few riding   
 horses kept. Walking and gardening are
 enjoyed by many and trout fishing and 
 photography by a few. Canoeing is done
 on the river Swale. Motorbike trials  
 are held in the area, the terrain     
 being suited to this activity. Some   
 residents are interested in music,    
 books and woodwork, with a minority   
 favouring the dramatic society and    
 darts. Sailing, wind surfing and      
 scouting are other hobbies enjoyed by 
 some, the facilities being found      
 outside the area.
