		<title>19LIFE IN CRUCKTON.</title>
		<content>{The small village of Cruckton}is      
 situated on a minor road linking the  
 B4386 and the A488. It is on the site 
 of the Roman Villa.{Cruckton Hall}is  
 a small independent school for teenage
 maladjusted boys. There is a small    
 crescent of council houses built to   
 house farm labourers for the council  
 farms to the east of the village.     
 The community is dependent upon       
 Hanwood for its nearest shop, church  
 and social activities. The inhabitants
 are employed on local farms, at Royal 
 Shrewsbury Hospital and elsewhere out 
 of the village. There is a high       
 proportion of retired people and only 
 a few children in the village. Small  
 congregations have caused the closure 
 and recent sale of Cruckton Church.   
 Issues concerning the villagers appear
 to centre on farming and pensions.
