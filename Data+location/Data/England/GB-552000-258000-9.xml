 reading and then get up.I make my bed 
 and dress.Once i've had my breakfast,I
 feed my rabbit.I call for Natalle and 
 go to school along with my sister.    
 When we get to school we put our      
 packed lunch box in the Hall and play 
 until the buzzer goes.We then change  
 our shoes,take off our coats and have 
 our first lesson_English.We then have 
 our play and snack.

 my packed lunch.In school again we    
 have different lessons,swimming,music,
 tennis and In The News_a radio        
 programme.After break we have topic.

 her.After tea I clean out the         
 rabbit,play some more ,go to bed at
