		<content> We visited Mr Hoggins at his farm.He  
 told us it is a farm of 160 acres,90  
 of which are pasture and forty are for
 hay.His farm is a mixed farm,mostly   
 dairy and some arable.The crops which 
 are grown are mostly cereals.Most of  
 these are sent to a corn merchant.The 
 cereals that are grown are winter     
 wheat and spring barley.Mr Hoggins    
 uses a crop rotation system for his   
 crops.The only crop used on the farm  
 is hay which is fed to the cows.His   
 cows are Friesians and he has 35 of   
 them.                                 
 When his cows calve he has to decide  
 which calves to sell and which to keep
 He sells the bull calves and keeps the
 heifers.He sells them to a merchant.  
 He feeds the calves on dried milk     
 powder,sugar beet pulp and cow cake.
