		<content> LOCAL POLITICS                        
 A local issue which has caused a great
deal of anger from the people of this  
area concerns the plans of the         
Department of Transport to widen the   
A1 road in the northern part of the    
area to allow it to carry a larger     
volume of traffic.A great number of    
local people are fiercely opposed      
to this on the grounds that it will    
damage the local environment and make  
life a misery for people who live near 
the road.                              
 Several public enquiries have been hel
to consult the general public but these
have had to be abandoned in the face of
local opposition.Local objectors have  
deliberately disrupted enquiry meetings
so that the plans could not be         
implemented.For the moment local people
appear to have won.
