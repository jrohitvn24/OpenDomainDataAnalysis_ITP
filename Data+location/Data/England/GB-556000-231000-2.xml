		<content>     {Barnard's Farm}has been a riding 
 school for 11 years.The farm covers 16
 acres,all of which is grassland.There 
 are various stable blocks and barns.  
 There are approximately 15 horses on  
 the farm at any one time.They have a  
 very hard life in the{Riding School   
 and each horse has a limited working  
 life.When the horses are too old to   
 work they are sold.The horses are not 
 bred on the farm and new stock is     
 bought in when necessary.There is one 
 part time worker on the farm who helps
 with the{Riding School.}Mentally      
 disabled people come three times a    
 week.Adults come from{Orford House}in 
 Ugley and children from a special     
 school in{Bocking.                    
      The{R.D.A.}runs fund raising     
 activities to pay for the hire of     
 horses and relies on volunteers to    
 help in the arena.                    </content>
