		<content> Over 80% of the households living in  
 Thurleigh have a car and a high       
 proportion have more than one car.    
 There is a good bus service to        
 Bedford, which calls at the village 6 
 times a day on weekdays and 4 times a 
 day on Saturdays. The buses provide a 
 good journey to work service, but     
 there is no public transport to enable
 people to use the entertainment       
 facilities offered in the town in the 
 evenings. A good deal of the          
 population travel to Bedford to work, 
 but there are still a few locally     
 based jobs. The Building and Funeral  
 business that has been in the village 
 for 350 years employs two village     
 people. Some are employed at a local  
 transport company and a few still work
 on the land. The largest employer     
 locally is the R.A.E. an experimental 
 and aircraft establishment.           </content>
