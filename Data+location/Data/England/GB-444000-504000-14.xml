		<content> When we started to count the people in
 our block we were not sure how to     
 tackle it. We decided to ask the      
 Parish Council to help us with the    
 people over 18 who were on the        
 Electoral Roll and we approached the  
 village doctor, Dr.Rider who gave us  
 the number of people under 18 from his
 computer records. We finally asked the
 whole school who did not go to Dr.    
 Rider and our total came to 1,949. In 
 the 1841 census there were 820 people 
 living in the village. We also found  
 out in a survey in our class that 29  
 mums or dads leave the village for    
 work each day and 10 stay in the      
 village for work and 21 actually stay 
 at home.                              
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
