		<content>    Hunting is an active pastime in    
 this area, both on horse and foot.    
    When we spoke to the underkeeper   
 for Lord Rosehill he explained that   
 many people come to shoot over that   
 estate. His job was to rear the       
 pheasants and gradually accustom them 
 to the wild without letting the fox   
 get them first. Besides these two     
 creatures he shoots or catches with   
 snares deer, rabbits and vermin. When 
 he sets a trap it is usually a piece  
 of wire with a loop in it, this is    
 always checked once an hour or the    
 animal will have prolonged suffering. 
    His method of catching his prey is 
 to stalk carefully knowing the habits 
 and instincts of the creature, but he 
 does sometimes use a whistle, a meat  
 bait or a decoy which seems to be     
 feeding happily, as an attraction.
