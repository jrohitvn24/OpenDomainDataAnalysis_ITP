		<title>12ATTITUDES IN FROXFIELD.</title>
		<content> During an interview with a key person 
 in the Froxfield Green area, this     
 information was obtained: In the past 
 village life depended on agriculture, 
 but now only 5% of the population do. 
 Basic housing is better (electricity  
 since 1954). The main religion is     
 Church of England &amp; average age of    
 congregation is 40-50. Services are   
 adequate, but the Post Bus is useless 
 so most people have cars (The old     
 'Wonderbus' was taken out of          
 service). The main issue today is the 
 heavy lorries on Stoner Hill.The area 
 has suffered a lot of rural           
 depopulation, and rates are not too   
 high, but their administration is not 
 efficient. Not many changes are deemed
 necessary, as the area is one of      
 outstanding natural beauty.
