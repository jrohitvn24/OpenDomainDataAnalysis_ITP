		<content> There are three churches in our area. 
 The Chapel at Seagry is the oldest    
 Methodist Chapel in this county. It   
 was built by two brothers, John and   
 Peter Carey. They gave the land for   
 the Chapel. They built it not as it is
 today. It had small windows. One      
 hundred and ten years ago they wanted 
 a new roof so they built the walls up 
 higher and put the roof on. John and  
 Peter Carey lived in the house which  
 joins on to the Chapel.               
     Another Chapel exists in Startley 
 but this is in a poor state of repair.
     The Church of St.Mary the Virgin  
 at Lower Seagry was completely rebuilt
 in 1849,having originally been founded
 in 1172 by Walter de Clifford.Many    
 relics of the old Church were replaced
 in the new building,which is full of  
 historic interest.
