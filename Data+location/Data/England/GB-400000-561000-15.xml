		<content> There are many clubs in Riding Mill. I
 go to Cubs. You have to wear a uniform
 which is a green jumper, some grey    
 trousers and a red neckerchief. We    
 play many games in side and out. Every
 year we make a little fire to cook    
 sausages and we have a drink as well. 
 I go to Gym club.You have to do       
 movements on the bar and also on      
 the box, the mats and the trampoline. 
 When you manage to achieve some thing 
 then you get a tick. When you get ten 
 ticks then you get a badge.           
 I go to choir. We practise some hymns 
 for the next Sunday so that when we go
 to church we improve the singing.     
 I go to "Watch" which is a nature     
 study club. Some times we go out and  
 look at the thing we are talking      
 about that week other times we just   
 take notes of what we are talking     
 about.                                </content>
