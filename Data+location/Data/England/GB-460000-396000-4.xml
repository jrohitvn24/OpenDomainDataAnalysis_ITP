		<title>04SHIFT  WORK, ROSSINGTON PIT</title>
		<content>     A Rossington miner reports,       
 " When we have had our safety         
 equipment checked we go to Number One 
 Shaft to wait for a lift to take us   
 down to where we work.                
     When we arrive underground we     
 travel on 'Paddy Trains' which        
 take us to the coal face. In the      
 Rossington Pit there are over 50 miles
 of underground railway track in use   
 and 'Paddy Trains' carry men and      
 equipment to and from the coal face.  
     We take our meal break underground
 in South Yorkshire we call it 'snap', 
 this usually lasts 20 minutes.        
     When our shift is over we return  
 to the surface by lift. We hand       
 in our checks and safety equipment .  
 Then we go and change out of our      
 overalls and go for a shower. After   
 this we return home."
