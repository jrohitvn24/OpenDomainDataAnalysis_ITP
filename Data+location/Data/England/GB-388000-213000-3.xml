		<content>A mixed Cotswold farm recently held a  
conference on the relationship between 
{modern farming} techniques and        
{wildlife.} This 850 acre farm has     
{wheat,barley, sheep and cattle.}There 
is a rich variety of                   
wildlife,however,partly due to the     
deliberate planting of {coverts.} Trees
include Oak,Maple,Crab Apple and       
Cherry.Such a variety provides ideal   
cover for {game.} Pincott Farm is much 
smaller with 50 acres. It is an old    
Cotswold stone building with emphasis  
on {Dairy} farming. Another farm has   
475 acres;135 of grassland;330 of      
arable and 150 {beef} cattle. The {work
force} numbers 5. The original tithe   
barn was built in 1500 but was rebuilt 
in 1962. The farmhouse itself dates    
back to 1534.
