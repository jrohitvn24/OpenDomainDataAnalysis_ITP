 the Post Office as a counter clerk.   
 Mrs.Cooke does all her main shopping  
 in Barnsley,but shops for some things 
 at Dodworth for example groceries.    
 She enjoys living in Dodworth because 
 of the countryside but she does not   
 like the noise of the traffic outside 
 her house.                            
 She has lived in Dodworth for 7 years 
 and likes the community spirit.She    
 thinks that there are many amenities  
 for the old in Dodworth but not enough
 for the young,all the community would 
 contribute funds to improve amenities.
 When she came to Dodworth,she was     
 accepted asa a resident,even though   
 she was not born there.All in all she 
 thinks Dodworth is a favourable place 
 to live.
