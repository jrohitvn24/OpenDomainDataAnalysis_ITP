		<title>04A Local Shopping Centre.</title>
		<content> Our local{shopping centre}comprises a 
 chemist with a pharmacy, supermarket, 
 newsagent with a post office,         
 take-away foodshop and a hairdressers.
 Also there is a dentist, a building   
 society and meeting rooms run by the  
{Y.M.C.A.}where activities take place  
 in the daytime like playgroups, judo, 
 dancing and lunch clubs. The public   
 house is the Book and Candle. Lots of 
 people use the centre because it is   
 near their homes but many only come to
 collect pensions or benefits from the 
 post office. Most people think that it
 is cheaper to shop in{Redditch town   
{centre.}The area around the shops is  
 not attractive; often it is littered  
 with paper. The pond in front of the  
 shops is dirty and dangerous for young
 children. A small playarea is provided
 and there are benches to rest. Many   
 folk would like a bank in the centre. </content>
