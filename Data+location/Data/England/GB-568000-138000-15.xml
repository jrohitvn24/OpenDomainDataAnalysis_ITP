		<content>There are three halls in Horsmonden    
which are all used for fund-raising    
activities &amp; as meeting-places for     
village organisations.                 
The Village Hall in Back Lane consists 
of a hall with a stage &amp; kitchen, &amp; is 
used by the Horsmonden Players for     
shows &amp; can be hired privately for     
wedding Receptions &amp; discos.  Parish   
Council Meetings are held here.        
St. Margaret's Hall in the Goudhurst   
Road was built in 1970 &amp; incorporates  
the Rectory.  The Sunday School meets

Methodist Church in Furnace Lane &amp; is  
used for Junior Church, Youth Club,
