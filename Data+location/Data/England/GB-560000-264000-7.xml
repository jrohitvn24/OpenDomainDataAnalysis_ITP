		<title>07 SHOPPING IN EXNING TODAY.</title>
		<content>                                       
 We made a survey on the aspects of    
shopping on two estates, Scaltback and 
Studlands, both with a parade of       
shops mostly covering daily needs like 
groceries,meat and newspapers. We also 
surveyed the village shop.We asked the 
customers questions like 'Why do you   
shop here?'.'What have you bought.'    
Most people bought food. The shops     
were used mainly because they were     
near to the customers home, although   
one woman came all the way from Barton 
Mills near Mildenhall to use one       
particular shop on the Scaltback       
estate.                                
Scaltback did the most business being  
on the largest estate followed closely 
by Studlands. Exning did not do much   
business because it was only a village 
shop.
