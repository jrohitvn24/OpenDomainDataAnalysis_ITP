		<title>18ATTITUDES TO LIVING</title>
		<content> Attitudes to living in this area are  
 based very much on the individual.    
 With a high percentage of self        
 employment or employment in small     
 concerns (farms) there is a tendency  
 to be isolationist. The fact of many  
 retired people also encourages the    
 attitude of 'my home is my castle'.   
 There are occasional (mainly summer)  
 efforts to engender close community   
 spirit but generally people get on    
 with their own lives with the         
 consequence that there is not much    
 local social mixing. Traditional homes
 for local attitudes - the local pub   
 (Boot Inn) and churches have been     
 notably low in attendance in recent   
 years. Local attitudes are variable in
 relation to the church -              
 traditionalists v modernists. Flyford 
 clergymen have found pockets of       
 resistance to their efforts.          </content>
