		<content>   This area is a rocky promontary     
 situated at the south-western tip of  
 Jersey. It is a granite area with     
 rugged cliffs,a soft gentle landscape 
 inland and much scenic beauty. The    
 terrain is rather flat and the soils  
 are light and poor. It is windswept   
 and this is especially due to the     
 prevailing winds which are south -    
 westerly and which are particularly   
 strong in autumn and winter.          
   The land consists mainly of small   
 farms, small fields, housing and      
 several small valleys. There is       
 evidence of archaelogical occupation  
 of the Neolithic period and a new site
 (still undated) has been found. Most  
 people are employed outside the area  
 which makes it something of a         
 "dormitory" area, but others are      
 occupied in agriculture and           
 tourism.                              </content>
