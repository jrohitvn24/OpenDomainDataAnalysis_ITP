		<title>10Young N.Luffenham mother</title>
		<content> This young mother is a native of N.L. 
 and attended the old village school.  
 She recollects the building of the    
 present school.After leaving full-time
 education she worked in Stamford      
 Library. She left to start a family.  
 Her young family prevents her from    
 going{out}to work but she is a        
 registered childminder. Apart from a  
 few "at home" sales parties and some  
 sport facilities at R.A.F. N.L., there
 are no other activities for young     
 housewives. Weekly bulk shopping is   
 at a Stamford supermarket and everyday
 needs are from the village shop.      
 Unable to drive she relies on the poor
 bus service and her children cannot   
 participate in the organised          
 activities most of which are outside  
 the area. Without a car she depends on
 meeting local friends for coffee or   
 lunch for her social needs.           </content>
