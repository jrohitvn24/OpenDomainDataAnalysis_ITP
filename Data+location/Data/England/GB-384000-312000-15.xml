		<content>THE LAST LOCK KEEPER ALSO SOLD LAMP    
GLASSES AND OTHER ITEMS NEEDED BY THE  
BOAT PEOPLE.                           
BY THE LOCK IS THE CANAL SHOP.IN THE   
SUMMERTIME MRS WALDRON OPENS THE SHOP  
TO SELL SOUVENIRS,SWEETS AND CANAL     
ITEMS TO VISITORS.SHE IS A CANAL ARTIST
AND DECORATES CANALWARE WHICH IS SOLD

WALKING ON FROM THE LOCK TO BRIDGE 18  
WE NOTICED BITS OF CLAY PIPE,FRAGMENTS 
OF POTTERY AND FRESH-WATER SHELLS ON   
THE GROUND.THESE HAVE AT SOMETIME BEEN 
BEEN DREDGED UP FROM THE CANAL.JUST BE-
FORE REACHING THE BRIDGE THERE IS A    
LITTLE BRICK STORE WHICH HOLDS PLANKS  
SIMILAR TO SCAFFOLDING PLANKS.THESE ARE
ALL AN EXACT LENGTH SO THAT THEY CAN BE
USED TO BLOCK OFF PART OF THE CANAL    
WHEN THE WATER BOARD WISH TO DRAIN IT  
FOR REPAIRS.THE NOTCHES THE PLANKS FIT 
INTO ARE UNDER THE BRIDGE.             </content>
