		<content>   The postman used to walk the 4 miles
 from Cheselbourne to collect and      
 deliver mail.It would arrive from     
 Dorchester on horseback.The doctor did
 his rounds on a pushbike.Everything   
 seemed cleaner and tidier then than it
 does today.                           
   The old people actually thought that
 we didn't have assemblies or do sums  
 or spellings in school today.They all 
 agreed that school was far more strict
 then and probably less fun.           
   The games they played were very     
 simple,like marbles,skipping,conkers  
 and hoops.They spent their \p pocket  
 money on sweets.                      
   In spite of all the hardships they  
 still said that they preferred 'the   
 good old days'.Life seems far too     
 hectic for them in today's world even 
 in a country village.
