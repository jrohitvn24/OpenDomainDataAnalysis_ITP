		<title>20Local Issues-Gotherington</title>
		<content> There are three local issues of       
 particular importance in Gotherington.
 Firstly, there is the issue of new    
 building developments in the village. 
 Building regulations state that the   
 houses must be made out of cotswold   
 stone type brick and must be counted  
 as infilling because the village is   
 not allowed to get bigger in area.    
 Secondly, there are no street lights. 
 This is because the Parish Council    
 held a vote and most people voted not 
 to have them partly because it puts   
 more money on the rates.              
 Thirdly, some trees are important in  
 the village and have a preservation   
 order on them and that means the trees
 can't be cut because they are         
 considered as special trees. Up on    
 Nottingham Hill there is a new wood   
 planted a year ago. They are destined 
 to replace a lot of diseased elms.    </content>
