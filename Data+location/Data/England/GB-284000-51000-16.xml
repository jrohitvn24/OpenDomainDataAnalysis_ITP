		<content>   A{swimming pool project}has been    
 considered since the late 19th        
 century.The swimming pool fund stands 
 at{Â£12,000}this year (1985), but      
 Â£60,000 is needed for a basic open air
{heated}pool.                          
  Land has been made available by{Devon
{County Council}at the Community       
 College at Milton lane. The County    
 Council together with South Hams      
 District Council,the Sports Council,  
 and other organizations will also be  
 putting forward the rest of the       
 money.  The pool will be a standard   
 size,{(8m by 25m).                    
  The pool will be used by the{school  
 and the{community.}It is envisaged    
 that a roof will be put on later.     
  Any profits made will be used to     
 provide equipment for the school.
