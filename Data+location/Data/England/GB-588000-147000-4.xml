		<title>04The Village Shop</title>
		<content>   I am thankful to be able to say that
 the village shop is still alive and   
 kicking and still has a useful part to
 play in the local community.  We are  
 grateful for regular local support and
 hope to provide goods and services in 
 the future.                           
   Village stores in general have seen 
 many changes during the past 20_30 yrs
 and sadly many have not survived.  One
 reason is the simple fact that they   
 cannot compete in price with super_   
 markets.  However, we are able to     
 stock a range of goods suitable to the
 local community.  We can still supply 
 Mr L's favourite tobacco and still    
 slice a single rasher to a certain    
 thickness! We maintain a delivery     
 service to the elderly, etc., and have
 an agency for Dry Cleaning, Laundry   
 and Shoe Repairs.                     
                                       </content>
