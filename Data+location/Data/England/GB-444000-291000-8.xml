		<content> Most of the area has a rural appear-  
 ance being dominated by farmland.     
  The only built up area of any        
 significance is Burbage, with the     
 smaller villages of Aston Flamville   
 and Sharnford.                        
  The farms are of a mixed variety,    
 chiefly growing wheat,barley and root 
 crops.Most of the cattle are of the   
 Freisian breed.Most fields are divided
 by hedgerows.On much of the farmland, 
 grass is an intensively cultivated    
 crop.This is used for pasture and for 
 cutting as silage or hay.             
  Burbage is now a suburb of Hinckley, 
 having rapidly expanded its housing   
 stock in the last 20 years.Most of the
 houses are private semi-detached and  
 detached dwellings.                   
  Industry has had a minimal impact on 
 the environment.The M69 Motorway has  
 reduced traffic in Sharnford.         </content>
