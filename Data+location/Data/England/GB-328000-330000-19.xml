		<title>19EVENTS The Derwen Fete</title>
		<content>                                       
                                       
 The fete raised Â£5,946 in 1985 which  
 was Â£8OO more than last year.The money
 is spent on providing better houses   
 for the students and more facilites.  
                                       
 The students arrive at 18 years of    
 age. During the first year the pupil  
 is assessed to see what he or she will
 be most suited to doing. The student  
 travels around the workshops so that  
 the teachers can see what the students
 like doing.The students stay two years
 and hopefully they will be able to    
 take a job later.                     
                                       
 During the term there are lots of     
 clubs and activities for the students 
 to join. There are discos on          
 Wednesdays and Saturdays.The drama    
 group puts on a play once a term.     </content>
