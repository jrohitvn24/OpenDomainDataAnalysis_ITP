		<content> There are the remains of a{Monastic   
{Priory}in Pentney which was, until    
 recently kept in good repair. The     
{Church}was built in Norman times. The 
 stump of a{Market Cross}still exists  
 and nearby is the Pound Field. Remains
 of a{bone crushing factory}exist from 
 the days when whale bones were ferried
 along the River Nar from King's Lynn. 
 Narborough village was built around   
 the Nar. Barges were used to bring    
 grain and malt to the{Maltings}for    
 brewing beer, some of which was sold  
 at the{Ship,}an old coaching inn. At  
 the rear of{Narborough Church}stands  
 an old building (now renovated) once  
 used as a mortuary and dwelling for   
 the grave digger. Corn was ground at  
 the{Mill}on the Nar; the wheel now    
 turns for display purposes.{Narborough
{Hall}was used as a hospital during    
 the First World War.                  </content>
