		<content>Most of the houses in the area are     
fairly modern,although there are some  
older ones.They are made of brick and  
are in good condition.There are also   
flats and maisonettes.All the gardens  
are fairly tidy and quite big.Only a   
few houses have garages as they were   
built before the people all had cars.  
 The majority of the houses are of the 
smaller 3-bedroomed type,but there are 
many different types of house;bungalows
terraced,semi-detached and flats.There 
is a mixture of private and council    
property.                              
 There are some new estates which have 
only recently been finished &amp; they look
very nice &amp; have garage blocks.The     
maisonettes are not in very good       
condition,looking dirty and often being
damp inside.
