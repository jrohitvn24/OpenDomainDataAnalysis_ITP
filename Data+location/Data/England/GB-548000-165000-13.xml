 about 60% coming from the village and 
 rest from outlying farms and

 about 7am and have a breakfast of     
 cereal (the favourites being Sugar

 generally leave for school between    
 8.15am and 8.30am.Most of them enjoyed

 like art and P.E..They arrived home   
 at about 4.15pm and played outside in 
 the summer and watched the TV.in      
 winter.They liked cartoons and action
