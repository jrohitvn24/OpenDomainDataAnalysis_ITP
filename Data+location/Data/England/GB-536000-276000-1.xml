		<title>01SOMERSHAM INTRODUCTION</title>
		<content>  SOMERSHAM DOMINATES THE SURVEY AREA  
 SITUATED 5 MILES  NE OF ST.IVES       
 (CAMBS) AND 15 MILES NW OF CAMBRIDGE. 
  SOMERSHAM WAS MENTIONED IN THE       
 ORIGINAL DOMESDAY BOOK, AND NOW       
 CONTAINS AN OLDER PART CENTRED ON THE 
 CURVED HIGH STREET WITH NUMEROUS      
 SHOPS, OVERLOOKED BY THE C13TH PARISH 
 CHURCH. SIX NEWER ESTATES (ONE UNDER  
 CONSTRUCTION) AND A NUMBER OF NEWER   
 NON-ESTATE DWELLINGS, HAVE INCREASED  
 THE POPULATION FROM APPROX 1500 TO    
 APPROX 3500, OVER THE LAST 25 YEARS.  
  SOMERSHAM IS SITUATED ON THE FENLAND 
 EDGE, FLAT LAND OVER WHICH STRONG     
 WINDS OFTEN BLOW AND WHERE DELIGHTFUL 
 SUNSETS CAN BE VIEWED.                
  SITUATED AMONGST ARABLE LAND WITH    
 MANY ORCHARDS, SOMERSHAM NOW CATERS A 
 GOOD DEAL FOR PEOPLE WORKING IN NEARBY
 TOWNS AND MANY SERVICE PERSONNEL FROM 
 NEARBY RAF AND USAF STATIONS.         </content>
