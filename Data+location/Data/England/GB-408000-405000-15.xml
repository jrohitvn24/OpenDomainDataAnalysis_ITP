		<title>15Stone walls - Quarries</title>
		<content> In this area the fields are divided by
 dry stone walls which in places are   
 suffering from neglect by farmers and 
 misuse by walkers. In marginal land   
 such as this where the use of the land
 to the farmer is very limited, it is a
 costly business to keep the walls in  
 good repair and in places they have   
 been left to decay.                   
  The walls are built from a course    
 sandstone which was quarried locally  
 and which is often called Millstone   
 Grit. There are several quarries      
 inthis block all of which are now     
 closed. Stone from these was also     
 quarried for the building of the local
 reservoir embankments. In some        
 quarries the illegal dumping of       
 household rubbish is a problem and a  
 worry to the local authorities,       
 conservation groups and others        
 concerned with the countryside.       </content>
