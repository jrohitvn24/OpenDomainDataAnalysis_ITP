		<content> Cycling.                              
         Cycling was one of the        
 projects offered during project week. 
 This consisted of taking some twenty  
 five pupils (mainly boys only four    
 girls took part) on day long rides    
 from the school.                      
         Each pupil was equipted with a
 five or ten speed bicycle (this was   
 important as many of the gradients in 
 this area are over one in seven).     
         A day trip would start at     
 about ten A.M.and finish at three     
 thirty. During the day the group would
 cycle about thirty five miles along   
 minor roads.                          
         The aim of this project was to
 provide pupils with an insight into   
 their own environment.
