		<title>07WEST MERSEA FISHING.</title>
		<content> In Mersea,there is a small fishing    
 fleet of 20 boats.The boats are 30 to 
 50 feet long depending on the type  of
 boat.There are some that are{beamers  
{crabbers}and{skifes.}The fishing boats
 go fishing for two or three days at a 
 time.The boats go fishing two to      
 twenty miles away from Mersea.When the
 fishing boats come in,the fish are    
 boxed up and put on a lorry to go to  
{East Mersea}and{Richard Haward,}the   
 Mersea Island fish merchant.They are  
 weighed in and packed.The next morning
 they are put onto a lorry which goes  
 to{Lowerstoft}where they are sold at a
 market to different buyers.The buyers 
 then sell their wares to fishmongers  
 who in turn sell the fish.
