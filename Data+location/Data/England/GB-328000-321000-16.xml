		<content> We walked along Llynclys road.Two     
 friendly locals directed us to cross a
 grass field towards a large oak tree. 
 We walked down towards a wooden gate, 
 climbed over it onto the Llwyntidmon  
 road.We walked along the narrow lane  
 and passed a white farm which then led
 us onto a small hamlet.We then came to
 a small stone bridge,which led us over
 the Shropshire Union canal.We walked  
 towards a crossroads and turned left  
 towards Crickheath.We then came to a  
 hamlet of farms the largest was       
 Crickheath Hall,with its pedigree     
 freisian herd.In contrast, opposite   
 was a neat modern bungalow.We then    
 came to East Farm which was an        
 imposing black and white seventeeth   
 century building.
