		<content> BULWELL QUARRY                        
 Bulwell stone is sedimentary rock     
 because when it was under the sea     
 layers and layers of magnesium        
 limestone made up the sedimentary     
 rock.Bulwell is very popular for its  
 limestone it can be used for many     
 things,like walls,crazy paving,       
 buildings,roads,and for its lime.Mr.  
 Sankey found some red clay and used   
 it for plant pots. Some people burnt  
 the sedimentary rock to get the lime  
 out they were called limeburners.     
 they did this in the 1450's.The       
 biggest use of the Quarry rock is to  
 make the underlayer of roads.They use 
 a black crusher machine so they will  
 get crush into little peices.Bulwell  
 was under water.When the sea went back
 rivers flowed to the sea leaving mud  
 and ooze which made limestone.
