		<content>{ Colwall Probus Club}was formed in    
 December 1983 under the guidance of   
 its founder chairman, Mr Geoffrey     
 Frost, who had previously been a      
 member of a similar club in Yorkshire.
 At inception there were sixteen       
 founder members and by 1985 the number
 had grown to thirty-seven.            
  Probus is derived from 'PROfessional'
 and 'BUSiness' and the club is open to
 men who have retired. It provides a   
 meeting point for the members who     
 appreciate and value additional       
 opportunities for fellowship; the     
 opportunity of listening to talks and 
 taking part in discussions on current 
 topics. Although there are many such  
 clubs nationally each one is          
 independent, there being no national  
 organisation. The Colwall club meets  
 twice monthly in the Colwall Park     
 Hotel.                                </content>
