		<title>08SAVAY  FARM</title>
		<content> Savay Farm is situated down a lane    
 off Denham Village.Its foundations    
 date back A.D.750 when the site was   
 originally a church house.The         
 foundations are made of Sarcesm Stone,
 the same sort of stone from which     
 Stonehenge was made.  The present day 
 farmhouse was built in 1125 by the    
 Derdent Family and was originally     
 called Derdent Manor.  The Derdent    
 Family lived in the farm for 250      
 years.  The Abbots of Westminster     
 owned it after the Derdent Family.    
 The Abbots let out the farm to farmers
 for 150 years.  Then the Mortons      
 Family rented the farm for 250 years. 
 In the 19th century the house was     
 bought by General Goodlake, the first 
 man to win the Victoria Cross.  The   
 House was next owned by Sir Oswald    
 Mosley  who was an M.P. for Harrow .  
 Sir Oswald Mosley was a fascist.      </content>
