		<title>10 Face Lift for North Hull</title>
		<content> The dullness resulting from sameness  
 is udergoing change. Two years ago a  
 drive through the North Hull Estate   
 was simply a through journey. Nothing 
 stood out to catch the eye. Nowadays, 
 every morning around half nine, the   
 pavements are filled by hoards of     
 young men on their way to or from     
 temporary canteens. A welcome break   
 from the smashing down, concreting in 
 and hammering up as new fences replace
 the old. Roofes are retiled on mass   
 and varying colour washes replace the 
 dirty grey of half a century of       
 weathered pebble-dash. Other and      
 growing variations are stone cladding,
 double glazing and storm porching,    
 noticeable by their comparative       
 rarity. A growing band of{house owners
 on this council estate are the only   
 ones who can or will make such high   
 cost improvements to their properties.</content>
