		<title>11History of Wistow &amp; Raveley</title>
		<content> The block is not rich in monuments and
 museums, but relics from Pre-Historic 
 and Roman times from the area are     
 housed in the Norris Museum at St.    
 Ives.  Nevertheless the block has     
 historical value, a Romano-British    
 settlement identified at Wistow and a 
 later Anglo-Saxon estate at Wistow.   
 This was granted to Ramsey Abbey when 
 the Benedictene Monastery was founded 
 in 974.  The Abbot had certain powers 
 over Wistow and Great Raveley. In the 
 l6th Century the powerfull Cromwell   
 family acquired several Ramsey Abbey  
 manors such as those of the Raveleys  
 and Wistow.  In the l7th Century the  
 manor of Little Raveley was one of 4  
 manors owned by the Earl of Sandwich. 
 During the l8th Century there was     
 rapid development of the Fenland      
 waterways for transport and landing   
 stages were maintained at Gt. Raveley.</content>
