		<title>08THE BATTLE OF FLOWERS</title>
		<content> The {Battle Of Flowers}is a carnival  
 which 40,000 people come to Jersey to 
 see every year.                       
{Clubs and societies}construct great   
 floats which are made of millions of  
 flowers. A{special visitor}comes each 
 year to open the carnival.            
 The first ever Battle of Flowers was  
 held in 1902 along {Victoria Avenue.} 
 It was held in celebration of {King   
{Edward VII'S Coronation.}After        
 this,the Battle has been held every   
 year except during the two World Wars.
 In the early days of the floats, Â£15  
 was the maximum prize money, now it   
 costs thousands of pounds to put on.  
 It is called the Battle Of Flowers    
 because years ago the floats were     
 attacked at the end of the parade and 
 people threw the flowers at each      
 other. Now the parade ends with a fire
 work display.                         </content>
