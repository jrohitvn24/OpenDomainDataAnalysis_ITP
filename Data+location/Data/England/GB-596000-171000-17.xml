		<content>   A figure in{local history}is Sir    
 Robert de Shurland, who died in 1310. 
 He was Lord of Shurland Hall and      
 Minster, Baron of Sheppey and created 
 a Knight Baron during the reign of    
{Edward I.}The King also rewarded him  
 with Warden of the Cinque Ports.      
   As Knight Baron of the{Manor House  
 he could collect any flotsam he could 
 reach while riding a horse through the
 ebb-tide. From this may have grown    
 this{legend:                          
   Hearing it said that he would be    
 killed by his own horse he had the    
 horse slain and buried on the beach.  
 Many years later he was to fall over  
 the horse's hoof, which was poking out
 of the ground, and die from his       
 wounds.                               
   Today a brass effigy of Robert de   
 Shurland can be found in Minster      
 Abbey.                                </content>
