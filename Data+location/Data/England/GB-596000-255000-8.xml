		<title>08Buxhall - Rural Lifestyle</title>
		<content> Most newcomers are attracted by the   
 area's{rural}nature. The landscape is 
 not outstanding but pleasant, the area
 quiet with a relaxing pace of life -  
 summed up as "Don't rush me - I'm     
 Suffolk". In choosing where to live   
 the ideal of a 'rural area' appears   
 the prime consideration. There is     
 little choice of housing, few         
 amenities and limited local employment
                                       
 There are several opportunities for   
 new residents to join in{village      
{activities}and those prepared to      
 participate in events are welcomed.   
 Although there is a limited social    
 life for young people this is not seen
 as a disadvantage providing transport 
 is available to nearby towns.         
                                       
 The{heavy dependance on cars}for      
 everyday life is disliked by some.    </content>
