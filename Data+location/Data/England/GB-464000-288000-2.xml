		<content>  There are 76 houses in Mowsley,25 in 
 Laughton and 10 outlying farms.The {  
{housing}dates mainly from the 18th and
 19th centuries.Both villages contain  
 examples of medieval thatched timber  
 framed structures;Mill Stone,Mowsley, 
 is one example,and the locally named  
 "Haunted House,"an empty building at  
 the back of Mowsley church.Laughton   
 has 2 mud-walled{cottages}which have  
 been brick-faced.Neither village has  
 any stone houses,the main building    
 materials being red and blue bricks.  
  Each village has a large{rectory}now 
 privately owned,and a number of big   
 houses, including farmhouses  which   
 no longer have farms attached.Most of 
 the houses are detached,though Mowsley
 has a few terraced {cottages}and 10   
 semi-detached houses.There are 6 {    
{bungalows}in Mowsley and 1 in         
 Laughton.                             </content>
