		<title>14A3 TRUNK ROAD BUTSER</title>
		<content> The first turnpike road in England    
 running from London to Portsmouth is  
 shown in a map circa 1810.In 1839     
 there were 40 stage coaches every day 
 in either direction stopping at Bottom
 Inn (the coaching station mentioned in
 Nicholas Nickleby,now a forestry      
 commission cottage).With the advent of
 motor traffic,it became the A3 route. 
 To cope with present day traffic a    
 dual_carriage way has been cut through
 Butser Hill at War Down.This section  
 was opened in 1984. A traffic census  
 taken at mid_day on a Sunday,from a   
 point near Bottom Cottage,recorded 18 
 vehicles in each direction in 2       
 minutes.The area is served by two     
 infrequent bus routes between         
 Portsmouth and Petersfield.
