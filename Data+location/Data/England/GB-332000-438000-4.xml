		<content> The 1981 Census indicates that the    
 area has a higher proportion than the 
 national average of the working       
 population in the professional        
 category, and fewer unskilled workers.
 There is also a high proportion of    
 families with students in Higher      
 Education. Very few people work in    
 manufacturing. The influence of the   
 nearby resort of Blackpool means a    
 large proportion work in shops,hotels 
 and restaurants. Many Poulton         
 residents are commuters and work in   
 Blackpool, Preston and Manchester.    
 Over 60% travel to work by car.       
 Unemployment is lower than the        
 national average-10%. In spite of a   
 marked fear of unemployment this is a 
 comparatively favoured area, and young
 people can still obtain casual work   
 and holiday jobs.
