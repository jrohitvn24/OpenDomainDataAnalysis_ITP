		<title>13Abbots Park,Cornwood(2)</title>
		<content> Today,1985,Abbots Park is planned and 
 landscaped with its carefully tended  
 gardens and background of hills and   
 moor:no modern housing-estate for many
 miles around could equal it.Modern    
 timber-preservation methods and mater-
 ials have successfully driven off,not 
 only the wood-boring beetles,but also 
 bats and swifts.Neither common,nor    
 black,redstarts now come this way.    
 Insecticides have decimated the butter
 flies.Swallows and martins are reduced
 to a few pairs.At night,the tawny owl 
 may still be heard,but the bloodchill-
 ing scream of the barn owl is heard no
 more, due to loss of nesting-sites.   
 Some species adapt &amp; survive.Buzzards 
 still soar overhead,and the spring    
 song of blackbirds,robins,dunnocks,   
 wrens &amp; a few thrushes can still be   
 heard,although the dawn-chorus is much
 diminished.                           </content>
