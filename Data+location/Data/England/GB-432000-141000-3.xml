		<title>03The Church, Abbotts Ann</title>
		<content>     St. Mary's Church, Abbotts Ann,   
 was built in 1716. The buildings have 
 not changed over the last 50 years.   
 The Rev. Michael Tristram is the      
 present rector.                       
     Services are held twice monthly,  
 alternately with Clatford Church which
 is also in the care of the rector.    
 There are services at 8am. and        
 10.45am. at which between 70 and 150  
 people attend.  There are 30 children 
 in the Sunday School and 12 members in
 the choir.  Volunteers are responsible
 for cleaning and flower arranging.    
     The Church Hall is used by the    
 following groups: Sunshine Club for   
 old people, Women's Institute, Play   
 school, Youth Group, Mothers and      
 Toddlers and Drama Group.             
     A group made kneelers which       
 commemorate, by name, those who have  
 been awarded 'virgin's  crowns'.      </content>
