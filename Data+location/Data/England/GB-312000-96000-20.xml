		<title>20COMBE ESTATE 2  R MARKER</title>
		<content> A large area of the estate is let to  
 the Forestry Commission and a thriving
 shoot is leased out to a syndicate,   
 but apart from this Mr. Marker takes  
 an active role in the maintenance of  
 the houses and those woodlands not    
 let. The estate is maintained by the  
 rents from the properties which are   
 used for upkeep and repairs but this  
 does not allow for any unexpected     
 capital expenditure. In the past land 
 has had to be sold but now the        
 potential of the village  is being    
 developed without losing final control
 of the properties.                    
 A group of derelict farm buildings is 
 at present being converted into       
 residential units and craft workshops 
 and the woodlands are being brought   
 into correct management. All this work
 must proceed slowly and much thought  
 to conserve what is best in the area. </content>
