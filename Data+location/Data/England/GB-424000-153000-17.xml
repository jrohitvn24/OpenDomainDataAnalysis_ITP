 Collingbourne Ducis Parish Council has
 11 members. The chairman is           
 Mr.B.Sample and he has held the office
 for the last seven years.The clerk is 
 Mrs.A.Hutchings. The council meets    
 erery month with the exception of     
 August and the meetings are now held  
 in the village hall.There are three   
 committees of the council and they    
 look after finance, planning and      
 property. These committees meet       
 occasionally, though the planning     
 group has the most to do as there are 
 lots of applications to build.        
 The parish council has provided play  
 equipment in three places in the      
 village; they have planted trees      
 around the recreation ground and they 
 have providedstreet lights in several 
 places.
