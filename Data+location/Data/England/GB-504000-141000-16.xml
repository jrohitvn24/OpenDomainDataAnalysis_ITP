 Horseblock Hollow - During the Civil  
 War, the hollow was filled with a     
 barricade made of the bodies of shot  
 horses.                               
                                       
 Surrey Puma - Puma like animal "seen" 
 by many people up until a few years   
 ago.                                  
                                       
 Summerfold House -During their court  
 ship the Duke of Windsor and Mrs.     
 Simpson stayed in this house.  A ditch
 was dug and police patrolled to keep  
 away the curious.  The house was      
 derelict after the war, but has       
 recently been restored.  The bedroom  
 that is attributed to be the one the  
 Windsors used is a lovely room with   
 windows on three sides.
