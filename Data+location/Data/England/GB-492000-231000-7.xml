		<title>07Housing in Woburn</title>
		<content> Apart from a few modern houses, the   
{Bedford Estate}still owns the majority
 of houses in Woburn. The style is     
 predominantly{Georgian}although there 
 are a number of{19th century estate   
{cottages.}The quality of the buildings
 is such that the{Council for British  
{Archeology}have included Woburn in its
 list of important historic towns. Many
 of the houses owned by the Duke bear  
 the Bedford Cipher.                   
 Many of the modern houses have been   
 built in keeping with the Georgian    
 character of the village. The         
 attractiveness of the village is      
 enhanced by the many hanging baskets  
 and the cobbled Market Square.
