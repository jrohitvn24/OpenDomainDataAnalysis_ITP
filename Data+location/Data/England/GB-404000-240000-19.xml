		<title>19N.C.D.L. Kennels</title>
		<content>  Situated just off the A44 road at    
 Wickhamford is a branch of the        
 National Canine Defence League. This  
 has existed for 20 years and,at the   
 present time,has 83 dogs of all       
 kinds.These are mainly stray dogs     
 brought in by the local police,or dogs
 which have suffered ill treatment.    
  There are various types of kennels   
 including some with tops on the runs  
 for dogs which are good at jumping.   
 Some kennels were specially designed  
 with infra_red heaters for older dogs 
 with arthritis.                       
  Members of the public are encouraged 
 to look around, and in fact an open   
 day is held. Many people fortunately  
 give homes to the stray dogs.Some dogs
 ,however,are unsuitable for living in 
 a private house and they spend their  
 life at the kennels.People,who have no
 dogs,sponsor these.                   </content>
