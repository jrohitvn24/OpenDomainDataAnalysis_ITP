		<title>15CARNIVAL DAY</title>
		<content> The carnival is something that happens
 each year.It is always fun because    
 there are lots of stalls and things   
 happening.There are also many floats. 
 The Brownies won this year for their  
 Gnome Garden float.                   
  There were fifteen decorated floats  
 and many people in fancy dress on     
 foot.The procession was led around the
 town by various jazz bands and        
 finished on the town playing fields,  
 where the winners were awarded their  
 prizes.                               
                                       
  On the field there lots of side-shows
 and attractions.These included a      
 bouncy castle,a Punch and Judy        
 show,Wheel of Fortune,Greasy          
 Pole,motorbikes and two ice cream     
 vans.                                 
  The motorbikes did not go very fast.
