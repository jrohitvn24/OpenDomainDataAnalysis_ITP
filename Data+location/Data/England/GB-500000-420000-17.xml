		<title>17ST.MARYS CHURCH</title>
		<content>   It is not really known why two      
 churches _ St.Marys and St.Peters were
 built in Barton.Initially there were  
 certainly not two parishes.           
                                       
{  St.Marys church}was built in the    
 12th century in the fashionable Gothic
 style of this time.Since it has been  
 built it has undergone many           
 alterations.The earliest part of the  
 present building is the North Isle    
 arcade,which was built in the 12th    
 century.Soon afterwards probably still
 before 1200 A.D,South Isle was built. 
 Its ornate designs tell of the        
 prosperity of the town in this period.
   Nowadays,St.Marys church is used for
 Weddings,Christenings and Funerals as 
 well as Holy Communions and fund      
 raising events.It is a lively,and     
 caring aspect of the community.
