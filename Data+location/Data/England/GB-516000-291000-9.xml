		<content> Although there is a great variety of  
 shops in {Yaxley}the majority of      
 people interviewed said that they did 
 there main weekly food shopping in    
 Peterborough as prices were more      
 competitive. The figures were as      
 follows for the sample interviewed:   
 one eight did their main weekly       
 shopping in the village where as seven
 eight did it in Peterborough,although 
 all of these did some shopping in the 
 village e.g. bakery,butchers,         
 greengrocers etc.                     
  There was some link between car      
 ownership and shopping patterns as    
 none of the people who did there      
 shopping in the village owned a car.  
 Nine tenths of the sample had one car 
 and a quarter of these had two.People 
 were quite happy with the regular half
 hourly bus service to Peterborough.
