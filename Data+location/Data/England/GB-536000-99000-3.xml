		<title>03Telscombe Cliffs History</title>
		<content> Telscombe Cliffs is right on the coast
 south of the village from which it    
 gets its name. Between the village and
 Telscombe Cliffs is a stretch of open 
 Downland some of which is farmed.     
 There is access between the village   
 and Telscombe Cliffs by a dirt road.  
 At the start of this is a short length
 of concrete road upon which there were
 two large guns during the Second World
 War,which one resident said could fire
 as far as France.                     
 The oldest area in Telscombe Cliffs is
 said to be The Warren, now called     
 Warren Way- a small housing estate.The
 Warren estate is said to date back 800
 years.There was a large manor house   
 which was at one time a riding stables
 and then a night club. Between 1960   
 and 1965 the old house was demolished 
 and the existing development took     
 place.  Kevin Gardner &amp; N.Reeves age 9</content>
