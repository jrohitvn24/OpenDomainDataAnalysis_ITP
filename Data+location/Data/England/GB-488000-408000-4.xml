		<content>{ Ashby,}in Scunthorpe, is a small     
 place but it is very interesting. Some
 of the{houses}are very old but look   
 nice and some are old but have stone  
 cladding and double glazing making    
 them look modern.                     
  The shops are good but there isn't a 
 lot of entertainment for young people,
 there is only one{amusement arcade    
 called Showboat and a couple of       
 cafes. There are only two{supermarkets
 because people go to Asda or Leo's    
 because things are cheaper there and  
 are all together, so it's quicker.    
  There are three{clubs}and two{pubs}in
 Ashby; more children can go into      
 clubs because their parents can't take
 them into pubs. There are five        
{hairdressers}in Ashby because people  
 don't go into town to have their hair 
 done, they usually go locally.
