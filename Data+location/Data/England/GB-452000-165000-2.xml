		<content> The A4 is a main road which runs in   
 front of Francis Baily C.P.School.    
 We did a traffic census when we       
 observed and then recorded the number 
 of cars, lorries, vans, buses,        
 motor-bikes,push-bikes,coaches and    
 farm vechicles. We went out at        
 9.30-10.00 am. and these are our      
 findings: CARS 225, LORRIES 42,VANS   
 62,MOTOR-BIKES 3,PUSH- BIKES 5,COACHES
 0 and FARM VEHICLES 2.                
  We also went out at 1.30-2.00 pm and 
 recorded the following:C-395,L-42,V-62
 B-4,M.B-8,P.B.-5,C-0,F.V.-0.          
 CONCLUSION:The A4 is a very busy road 
 with constant traffic, more cars using
 it than any other vehicle.The A4      
 stretches from Reading to Newbury.    
 During the morning more vehicles      
 travelled towards Reading but in the  
 afternoon more travelled towards      
 Newbury.                              </content>
