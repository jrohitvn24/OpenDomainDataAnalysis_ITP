		<title>03Living in flats in Brixton.</title>
		<content>I live in a block of flats call Barrett
House.  It is quite a new block of     
flats.  It is in Stockwell Park        
Estate.  On the ground floor are       
garages, then I have to go up a flight 
of stairs to get to the level that I   
live on.  I have three floors in my    
flat. Each floor is quite small. The   
first floor has nothing on it at all.  
The second floor has a living room on  
it, an airing cupboard and a kitchen   
and the third floor has three bedrooms 
a toilet and a bathroom.  I enjoy      
living where I live because there is a 
supermarket, a chemist and a doctors   
surgery around the corner from where I 
live.  Brixton Market is just off the  
estate, so that means my mum can get   
all the food she needs quite           
quickly.There are six people in our    
family and since there are only three  
bedrooms everyone has to share.        </content>
