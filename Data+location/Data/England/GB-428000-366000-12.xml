		<title>12Home Life around Beeley Moor</title>
		<content> Of the thirty inhabitants living in   
 the ten dwelings located within this  
 area, seven families are dependent on 
 farming for their livelihood, one     
 family run a boarding kennels and the 
 two other dwellings are private homes.
 Of the inhabitants only two are senior
 citizens, eight are school children   
 and twenty are gainfully employed. The
 two groups of habitations are fairly  
 isolated, being two to four miles from
 the nearest villages: Ashover and     
 Holymoorside. They are not served by  
 public transport and rely on private  
 cars for their mobility. The farms and
 cottages in this area are all sturdily
 built in local stone and some have    
 been renovated and moderised,         
 preserving the exterior appearance of 
 the original buildings. Farm buildings
 in some cases being considerably older
 than the farm house.                  </content>
