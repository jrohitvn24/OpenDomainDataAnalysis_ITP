		<title>14AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL</title>
		<content>      Aircraft approaching London      
 Heathrow Airport from the North of    
 England or the Midlands pass right    
 over Bovingdon. The airway called     
 'Amber 1' is an aerial 'corridor'     
 along which commercial aircraft fly.  
 This is an area of controlled airspace
 where every aircraft has to be in     
 touch with the nearest Air Traffic    
 Control Centre. Bovingdon is a        
 reporting beacon and holding point for
 the 'London Terminal Control Area'. If
 Heathrow Airport is very busy, planes 
 may have to wait their turn to land.  
 They do this in a 'stack' by flying in
 an elliptical path around a reporting 
 beacon like Bovingdon. Each layer of  
 the stack is 1000 feet apart. As the  
 lowest planes get their turn to go and
 land the others waiting go down one   
 layer to await their turn.
