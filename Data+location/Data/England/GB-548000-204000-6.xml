		<content> In Vicarage Lane there is an Orchard. 
 It covers 8 acres of land.  He has 2  
 pear trees, 3 victoria plum trees.    
 1 green gage and 18 apple trees.  They
 have been grafting apple trees for    
 6,000 years.  They have also got 62   
 other sorts of trees.  He has for bee 
 hives buf one is not in use.  The     
 queen bee and her swarm live four     
 weeks in the summer and all winter.   
 He did keep geese but they got rid of 
 them because they pulled the washing  
 off the line, stamped on it and made  
 it dirty.  He has one of the rarest   
 plants in England which is called     
 woand.  Woand is a kind of dye. You   
 put it in the water and it dyes the   
 material clear.  If you hang it on the
 line it goes blue.  The Ancient       
 Britans used it to dye their faces.
