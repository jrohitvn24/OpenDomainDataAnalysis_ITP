		<title>05Ecology-Capel Nature Reserve</title>
		<content>The Capel Countryside Club,open to     
anybody,looks after the council owned  
reserve.                               
in our survey of the reserve we found  
water insects and leeches in the stream
under the bridge.Further into the      
reserve there are birds such as yellow 
and grey wagtails,cuckoos and house    
martins.An owl lives in a black Italian
poplar tree.The most common trees are  
Oak,Poplar and Ash.Animals in the      
reserve are foxes,voles,mice and       
shrews.There could be badgers.         
There is some pollution.There are lots 
of pieces of glass in the stream.Worst 
of all there is clay with bits of oil  
in it.
