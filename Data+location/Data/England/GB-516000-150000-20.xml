		<content>   We asked some of the people we      
 talked to if they had any religious   
 beliefs or{supernatural}experiences.  
   Whilst some believed,some had no    
 beliefs one was a dedicated{Christian,
 church warden and a member of the     
{Synod,}another was a Methodist and    
 another a converted Catholic.         
   There were people who told us they  
 had seen ghosts or heard voices and   
 had{psychic experiences.}One man had  
 seen the outline of a head on the back
 seat of his car.Noises of a punch-bag 
 had been heard at a pub which used to 
 have a boxing ring in it.A steady     
 grave-digger had heard mumbled voices 
 in a tomb.A middle-aged secretary had 
 a vision of her deceased father in law
 warning her to expect disaster when   
 she got home.Disaster had struck! She 
 had been burgled and her daughter     
 had knife injuries.                   </content>
