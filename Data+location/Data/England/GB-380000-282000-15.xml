		<title>15 Footpaths &amp; Bridleways.</title>
		<content>The area has many footpaths &amp;          
bridleways.Generally these are clearly-
signposted,in good condition,&amp;         
obviously well used,especialy near     
Kinver Edge &amp; the village.Local farmers
reported few problems where paths      
crossed farmland,although a few walkers
found it difficult to follow a path    
when it crossed the middle of a field. 
Two County Council-maintained long     
distance paths meet in the area;the 95 
mile Staffordshire Way &amp; the 14 1/2    
mile North Worcestershire Way,which    
join at Kingsforel Country Park(the    
county boundary).Regular path main-    
tenance,even step building has been    
nesacery on the heavily used section   
where the Staffs way climbs Kinver Edge
Local legand says the broad,straight   
path which suddenly narrows near Herons
Gate is a roman road which was abandon-
ed when the Romans left Britan.        </content>
