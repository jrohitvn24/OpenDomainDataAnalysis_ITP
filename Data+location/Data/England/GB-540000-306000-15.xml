		<title>15A DAY IN THE LIFE OF ...</title>
		<content> For the last lesson we had writing    
 practice. School finished at 3.30pm   
 but I stayed to Drama Club until      
 4.15pm. I walked home and met my Mum  
 at the Village Hall where she had been
 collecting my sister from her Ballet  
 lesson. After tea I played with my    
 toys and watched Athletics on the     
 Television. I went to bed at 8pm and  
 read my library book until 9pm and    
 fell fast asleep.                     
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
