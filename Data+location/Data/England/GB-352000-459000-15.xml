In May 1984 a group of people from     
St.Michaels went to inspect the tunnel 
entrance at Abbeystead because they    
thought the water board was pumping too
much water into the River Wyre,this was
causing flooding further down river.   
While they were there there was a      
terrible explosion.Many people were    
killed or badly injured.               
      After an enquiry they say the    
explosion was caused by methane gas    
coming from the rocks.They are spending
one million pounds to repair the tunnel
and to make sure nothing like this     
happens again.They are starting this   
work very soon.No more visitors will be
allowed in but they can look at the    
pumping station from a fence a  bit    
away.Everyone in the district was very 
sad when the disaster occurred.
