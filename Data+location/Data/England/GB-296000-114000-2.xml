		<title>02The Villages NE. of Tiverton</title>
		<content> Chevithorne has a war memorial as you 
 come into the village.Opposite is     
 St.Thomas' church built in 1843.It    
 also has a small Methodist Chapel and 
 I expect people go there on Sunday    
 mornings.There is also a village hall 
 which used to be a school.There is a  
 post box and a public telephone.There 
 are a lot of fields and a few houses  
 and farms.At East Mere there used to  
 be a dairy.There are a few houses but 
 most of East Mere is fields and       
 countryside. There are no pubs in the 
 villages so most people shop in       
 Tiverton.There is a long lane with    
 fields and hedges and a few houses at 
 the side in East Mere. In Craze Loman 
 the river Loman is crossed by a bridge
 with a water measure beside it because
 of floods. There is a cottage where   
 they make soft toys. The gardens are  
 very neat.                            </content>
