		<content>  The stability of the population has  
 helped to perpetuate rural traditions 
 The celebration of the annual Harvest 
 Supper is a pleasant social evening   
 involving people of many varied       
 interests and all age groups. The     
 proceeds are usually given to charity.
  There is a long-standing tradition of
 picking whinberries on the surrounding
 hills. In the past, whole families    
 helped to pick the berries, thus      
 supplementing the family income.Today 
 it is a purely recreational activity. 
  There are some members of the British
 Horse Driving Society, Pony &amp; Trap    
 Section,in this area.Local enthusiasts
 meet on a regular basis.              
  The S.Shropshire Hunt is active here 
 and is entertained with the tradition-
 al Stirrup Cup at a local farm.Fox-   
 hunting does not enjoy such widespread
 support as in former days.            </content>
