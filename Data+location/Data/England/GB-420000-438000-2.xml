 thanes.It was given by William to one 
 of his archers, Paul,for services     
 rendered in battle.Paul de Rawdon's   
 family was connected with the village 
 for 600 years.The family house E of   
 the church still exists.It became the 
 property of another local family the  
 Laytons.Francis L.1577-1661,was one of
 the masters of the Jewel House of     
 Charles I and II.In 1645 he compounded
 for his estate Â£3670 to the           
 Parliamentarians.Two yeats later he   
 started the building of St. Peters    
 church.His son Thomas built the old   
 school in 1710.South of the village is
 Crag Wood where several wealthy       
 industrialists built their homes.On   
 the slopes of the Billing were three  
 old coal pits.Many quarries round     
 about provided sandstone for building.</content>
