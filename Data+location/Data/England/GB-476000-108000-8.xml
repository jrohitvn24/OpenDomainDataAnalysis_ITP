		<title>08Hell's Angels</title>
		<content> Hell's Angels are a group of young    
 men who dress in leather jackets, ride
 motor bikes and hang chains around    
 their necks. This particular group of 
 Hell's Angels call themselves the     
 Havant City Rockers. We found this out
 for they have been writing this all   
 over the trees surrounding Racton     
 Tower, we found this when we visited  
 Racton Tower for the Domesday Project.
 The Hell's Angels hold their meetings 
 in Racton Tower and sit around a fire.
 They burn their best possessions.     
 Ordinary people think that some       
 Hell's Angels are disgusting, some    
 people are frightened of them.
