		<content>     Hatley Hall is the home of the    
 Astor Family who have long been       
 associated with Parliament and        
 Government. Their most famous member  
 was Nancy Witcher Astor (1879_1964),  
 wife of the 2nd Viscount of Cliveden  
 who was the first woman to sit as a   
 member of the House of Commons being  
 returned as Conservative member for   
 Plymouth in 1919 and at every general 
 election subsequently until her       
 retirement in 1945. She was a keen    
 champion of women's rights, social    
 reform and temperance movements.
