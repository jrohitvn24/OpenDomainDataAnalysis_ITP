		<content>{          THE SQUARE}                 
 The village of St. Keverne lies one   
 mile inland from Porthoustock on the  
 east coast of the Lizard peninsula. In
 the centre of the large village square
 there is a granite cross which        
 commenorates deaths in the first and  
 second World Wars.  The church tower  
 is 60 feet tall and the spire is      
 another 40 feet.  The church is such  
 an important landmark for ships to    
 warn them of the deadly Manacle rocks 
 that when the steeple was destroyed by
 lightning in 1770 it was quickly      
 replaced.  The shops in the square    
 consist of a post office, a butcher, a
 grocer and a gift shop.  There are two
 pubs, the Three Tuns and the White    
 Hart. Around the memorial there are   
 parking spaces. There is a garage, a  
 telephone box and a bus shelter. All  
 these form the 4 sides of the square. </content>
