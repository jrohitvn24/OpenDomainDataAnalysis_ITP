		<content> The number of land-owning farmers has 
decreased,and farm units have got - and
continue to get- larger.This has led to
larger and more expensive machines and 
a reduction in the number of employees.
For certain crops using expensive and  
very specialised equipment,several     
farms share machines in a farming group
-examples are pea and bean harvesting  
and sugarbeet harvesting.              
 The old traditional "mixed" farm now  
exists only with a very few small      
farms. Pig and poultry production is   
largely done under contract (not a     
suitable system for the small          
producer).                             
 A livestock market operates at nearby 
Wickham Market,but the Ipswich         
livestock market has recently closed.
