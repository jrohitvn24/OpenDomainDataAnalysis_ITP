		<title>01BARNBY in the WILLOWS(Notts)</title>
		<content>  Barnby  is  a  village   which   has 
 escaped the interference of motorways 
 and trunk roads and remains a  cul de 
 sac backed on two  sides by the River 
 Witham  which  more or less forms the 
 boundary  between Nottinghamshire and 
 Lincolnshire   at   this   point. The 
 village  is  no  longer surrounded by 
 meadows  and   willow  trees,  modern 
 dredging  of the dykes  and river has 
 cleared away the willow trees and the 
 meadows have been ploughed for cereal 
 production.                           
  The A1,A17,&amp; A46 are reasonably near 
 as is the main  London  to  Edinburgh 
 railway  line,  the  nearest  station 
 being in Newark some five miles away. 
  There   is   mains    water,   mains 
 electricity, a good sewage system and 
 street lighting, all  relatively new, 
 having been  installed  quite  within 
 living memory.                        </content>
