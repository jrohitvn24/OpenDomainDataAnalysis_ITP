		<title>03KEMPSEY'S GENERAL STORE.</title>
		<content> 'The Original Stores' is  owned by    
 Mr.G.W. Halford. The building is 485  
 years old, but the shop has been there
 for the last 100 years. Mr. Halford   
 has worked at Kempsey's main shop     
 since 1955 and has no intention of    
 changing his job.                     
   The store sells everything from coal
 to videos and the shop does a fair    
 trade. Out of the 400 customers that  
 they get each day, the main item sold 
 is the fruit and vegetable produce    
 which is boughtfrom the market-gardens
 in and around Kempsey and other goods 
 from cash and carry stores.           
   The shop doesn't use electric or    
 computerized technology as they like  
 to work with old tills and scales.    
   The shop is successfully fighting   
 off the challenge of the supermarkets 
 at the expense of Mr Halford's own    
 holidays for the last five years.     </content>
