		<content> Morley St. Peter's Church is on the   
 south side of the village. It has a   
 square tower, indicating that it was  
 built in Norman times, and a          
 graveyard. The graves are placed on   
 the south side of the church because  
 the shaded side represents a sign of  
 the devil. Inside there is an altar,  
 pulpit and lectern carved as an eagle.
 It has a stained glass window showing 
 parables of the bible, and a font.    
 About 30 people attend each week, but 
 the services are alternated between   
 St. Peter's and St. Botolph which is  
 to the north west. It was built in    
 1240 and the respected John Graver    
 Browne of Morley Hall is buried there 
 in a vault under the nave. A number of
 rare  wild flowers grow in the        
 churchyard and therefore the grass is 
 left to grow long
