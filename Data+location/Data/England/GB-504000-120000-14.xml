		<title>14BOROUGH FARM, PULBOROUGH</title>
		<content>  On a hill 306 feet above sea level   
 stands Borough Farm House. The present
 house dates from 1899 but incorporates
 parts of the structure of an earlier  
 building. From the house there are    
 extensive views to the North Downs    
 some twenty miles distant.            
  In the hall of the house is a framed 
 extract from "The Times" newspaper of 
 6th May, 1886 to the effect that the  
 house and farm is for sale. It claims 
 that "it is not to be surpassed by any
 place in the country for salubrity".  
  The earlier part of the house        
 contains some "Pulborough" stone,     
 probably quarried on the farm itself. 
 The rebuilt house contained some 17   
 bedrooms, some of which have been     
 since converted into bathrooms.       
 As late as 1948 the house had no      
 electricity or piped water.
