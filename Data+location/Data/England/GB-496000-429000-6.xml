		<title>06LITTLE WAULDBY FARM.</title>
		<content>   Little Wauldby Farm has been in the 
 same family for thirty years although 
 the present owners have only been     
 living in it for two years. The family
 enjoy the job and would rather be     
 farmers than anything else. The farmer
 is the cousin of the owner of         
 Wauldby Farm. He is busy building a   
 potting shed for his indoor plants and
 he enjoys gardening as a hobby. The   
 farm is three hundred acres in area   
 and twenty two of them are used for   
 grazing.
