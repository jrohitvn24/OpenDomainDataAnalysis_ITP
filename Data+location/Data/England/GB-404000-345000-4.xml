		<content>   The three main localites for the    
mining operations were Stanton,Starwood
and at the Tunnel shaft in Cotton Dell.
In the summer of 1862 some good        
quantites of copper and lead ore were  
found in a shaft at Ribden, and some of
the local copper ore was of very high  
quality. Mining for coal began in      
Starwod early in 1859, where they were 
trying to recover a seam less than 2   
feet thick but work came to a          
standstill because of lack of air. The 
shaft has been filled with waste from  
the adjacent copper works but the level
is still open in Cotton Dell. There is 
a small flow of water from the level   
and there are traces of iron ore       
deposits on the floor. A Miss Agnes    
Allen,aged about 90yrs,who now lives in
Cheadl,can remember the men from       
Oakamoor digging up coal from the      
field by Owls Clough in the 1930's.    </content>
