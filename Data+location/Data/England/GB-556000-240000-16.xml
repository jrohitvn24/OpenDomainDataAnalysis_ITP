		<title>16OUR VILLAGE POSTMAN (cont.)</title>
		<content> of parcels up to 50lbs it is not      
 unusual to see{Mr.Moss}pushing his    
 bike with a flymo,or a small barrow on
 the front carrier.At about 11.40 am   
 his work is finished,and he cycles    
 home having done his regular 15 miles.
    In the winter it is a very cold job
 and he often has to push his bike when
 the roads and lanes are slippery,and  
 on rainy days he gets soaked to the   
 skin.Mr.Moss is very busy at Christmas
 time and after Christmas he delivers  
 many booklets and holiday brochures.  
 It's an interesting life for our      
 village postman and he meets and knows
 every person in the village.He loves  
 his job very much and never wants to  
 part from it.
