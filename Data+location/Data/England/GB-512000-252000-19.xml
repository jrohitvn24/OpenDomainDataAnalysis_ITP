		<title>19Tempsford Water Mill.</title>
		<content> Tempsford Water Mill began life as a  
 flourmill and was four storeys high.  
 Today it is a one storey building with
 one wheel which until recently was    
 used to saw wood imported from Norway.
 There used to be five men working at  
 the mill;now there is only one.       
 The surrounding land is sometimes     
 flooded during the winter and so in   
 the summer it is used for grazing.The 
 mill is still in working condition and
 is on land which is part of the       
 Tempsford Estate.
