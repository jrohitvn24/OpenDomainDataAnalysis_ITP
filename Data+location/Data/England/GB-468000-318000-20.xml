		<title>20Saturday mornings-C.Walkley</title>
		<content> On a Saturday morning I get up at 9.30
 because I have a piano lesson at      
 10.30.When I am dressed I have my     
 breakfast. I have Coco Pops cereal and
 a croissant for my breakfast.I then go
 and feed my fish called Yorkie.He eats
 a fish food called "Fish Flakes". Then
 I go and feed my rabbit.He is called  
 Snoopy and he has white fur.He has a  
 plastic cover over his hutch in case  
 it rains.His hutch is in the back     
 garden behind our house.Then I go     
 inside and look at my fish Yorkie in  
 his fish tank on our breakfast        
 bar.A breakfast bar is where we eat   
 our breakfast.Our dog Duke is wagging 
 his tail at me. Then I get my coat on,
 say goodbye to my Mum and go to my    
 piano lesson.
