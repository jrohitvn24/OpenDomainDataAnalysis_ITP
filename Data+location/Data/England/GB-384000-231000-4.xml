		<content> The church of St. Mary the Virgin is  
 built of blue Lias rubble with roofs  
 of tiles and Cotswold stone slates.   
 The oldest part of the church is a    
 13th Century stone altar which is one 
 of the very few of these altars to    
 survive the Reformation. The original 
 chapel was enlerged to a church in the
 14th Century but several changes and  
 restorations have taken place since   
 then; the most recent in 1893 by J.R. 
 Yorke.                                
 Just outside the church are the       
 village stocks and whipping post      
 complete with iron manacles and       
 seating which have survived almost    
 intact from 1787.                     
 At the bottom of the hill is the Pound
 Pond, which is believed to have been  
 the ducking pool for scolding wives.
