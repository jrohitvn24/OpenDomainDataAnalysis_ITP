		<content> All the buildings are stone,brick and 
 slate.The{granary}is above the Cart   
 Shed.The wheatsheaves were stored in  
 one part then they were put into the  
 steam _driven threshing machine.The   
 bags of grain went into the granary   
 and the straw went to the barn.Today  
 it is used as a machine store.The     
{stables}still have the wooden feeding 
 frames.The doors and windows are      
 broken.The three calf houses are next 
 to the cart shed under the granary and
 lofts.The troughs are still           
 there.There are two dutch barns and a 
 long open cattle shed.The pig sties   
 are separate from the other           
 buildings.The hayloft over two sties  
 would keep the pigs warm.There was a  
 boiler  for slops which were poured   
 through an outside chute.
