<title>19Bradley School</title>
<content>

Bradley School is still open,for business and still has 46 pupils.  We now have an extra classroom to create more space for the infants, and have demolished the old toilet block that used to dominate the playground.  We've also gained a playing field with lots of play equipment.&lt;br />&lt;br />The old bell tower, which was out of use in 1986 was restored as a millenium project although we rarely use it.&lt;br />&lt;br />Computers were a novelty when the school took part in the Domesday Project, now they're a part of our every day life.   &lt;br />
