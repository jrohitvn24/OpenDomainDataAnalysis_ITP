		<content> Mr Stacey was a founder member and    
 past Chairman of the Hall Committee.  
 'The Hall has been a very important   
 facility of this Community although it
 is only booked for fifteen percent of 
 the available time.                   
 Organisations like the{Church, the    
{Womans Institute}and the{Youth Club   
 book it for their use.                
 The Hall is also used for{Wedding     
{Receptions and Disco's.               
 Only a small charge is made to cover  
 the running costs. Elaborate repairs  
 or improvements such as the Toilets   
 recently are paid for by{fund raising 
{which all the Organisations}take part 
 in. After the Building Contractor has 
 left we do the painting excetera so we
 keep the costs down.
