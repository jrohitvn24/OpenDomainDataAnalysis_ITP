		<content>  THE MANOR.                           
    Mr. Beresford gave us each a thing 
 to do on the village for the Doomsday 
 Project,and we got buildings.We were  
 asked to look around the Manor so     
 first of all we tried to find the     
 'phone number,but we couldn't.        
   So then we found out that they      
 weren't in in the week,so we wrote a  
 letter to them and said could we go   
 and look around the Manor.They wrote  
 back and said yes,we could go but we  
 would have to get the key off the     
 builder who was building there.       
   So we went on a Thursday.Our first  
 step was into the sitting room and we 
 found out that there was a large      
 fireplace as high as me and 5 feet    
 wide.There were exposed beams in the  
 walls and ceiling,and a wooden        
 floor.There were no original windows.
