		<title>20Park Spring's Estate.</title>
		<content> One of the other things that I do not 
 like about the estate is that all the 
 houses are painted the same colour.If 
 people want to paint their houses a   
 different colour they have to get     
 permission and they have to pay for   
 the paint themselves.                 
 My cousin goes to the Adventure       
 Playground on the estate but she is   
 not allowed to go to the Youth Club   
 because they some times have a lot of 
 trouble there.
