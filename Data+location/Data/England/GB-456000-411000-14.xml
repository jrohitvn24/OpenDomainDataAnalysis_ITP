		<title>14         JOBS</title>
		<content>{Askern}is a{coal mining}village so    
 many men are miners. However there is 
 a lot of unemployment in the country  
 at the moment so we expected to find  
 some people with no{jobs.}Out of 105  
 men interviewed,28 men had no{jobs}and
 of the remaining 77, 18 were miners   
 and 2 worked at the coalite plant.    
 Almost all the other men had manual   
 jobs. Three were plumbers, three      
 painters and two lorry drivers.       
     Out of 109 women, only 54 had {   
{jobs,}the most common  being cleaning 
 which 11 women did. Amongst the women 
 there were 6 nurses but apart from    
 that, most women did unskilled work.  
 Three of them were shop keepers. In a 
 mining community most women do not    
 work. They are housewives.
