		<content> On a typical school day I get up at   
 7:30am. I get dressed and have my     
 breakfast of ricicles, toast and a    
 drink of tea and watch Brakfast Time  
 on television. At 8:30 mum takes      
 William, Wendy and me to school in the
 car. At 3:45pm I come home from school
 and let Tim out of the kennel and give
 him a bowl of water and take him for a
 walk. I take him just over the        
 motorway bridge and back again. I     
 watch television until tea time when I
 have chips and baked beans. After     
 tea I go and do my violin and clarinet
 practice for half an hour. Then I get 
 Mum to help me with my spellings and  
 tables and hear me read. If it is a   
 lovely day Dad and I go for a  bike   
 ride with Tim. When I come back I have
 a drink and something to eat.
