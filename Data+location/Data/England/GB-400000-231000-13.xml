		<title>13THE LOCAL ENVIRONMENT</title>
		<content> We asked people if there was anything 
 that they disliked about the local    
 environment. In such a pretty village 
 as Alderton it is not surprising that 
 most people were satisfied with their 
 surroundings. However, there were some
 complaints. Surprisingly 5 people     
 complained about the noise of traffic 
 and 3 mentioned low-flying aircraft as
 a nuisance. Two people felt isolated  
 and this was endorsed by 2 more who   
 complained of poor bus services. Four 
 wrote that the people were not as     
 friendly as they might be and one     
 complained of the manners of some     
 children. The single complaint about a
 lack of street lights has some hope of
 remedy one concerning the weather has 
 not! There was a lot of concern that  
 future building development should be 
 restricted.                           
                                       </content>
