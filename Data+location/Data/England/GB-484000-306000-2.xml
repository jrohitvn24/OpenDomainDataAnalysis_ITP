		<title>02Oakham Castle</title>
		<content> Oakham Castle was originally built as 
 a manor house in 1180, by Walkelin de 
 Ferrers.  By 1521 the castle was      
 virtually a ruin with only the hall   
 kept in repair.  On Mondays it is used
 as a Magistrates Court.  (by Emma     
 Thompson)                             
                                       
 Oakham Castle still stands today      
 although some parts of it have fallen 
 into disrepair.  It is a custom that  
 any noble person on his first visit to
 Oakham must leave a horse shoe to be  
 put on display in the castle.  They   
 date from about 1492 to 1985.  Oakham 
 Castle is now used as a Law Court.
