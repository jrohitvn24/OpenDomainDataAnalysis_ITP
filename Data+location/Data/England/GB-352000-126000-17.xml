		<content>  In 1977 the village celebrated the   
 Silver Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth 11. 
 A village meeting decided that money  
 left after the celebrations should be 
 used to provide showers in the playing
 field pavilion.Two years later a      
 committee started to raise more money 
 for showers. In 1980 another committee
 made plans to build a much bigger     
 building.In September 1984 work on the
 building of the Community Centre      
 began. It took eight months and it was
 finished on April 25th. 1985.The      
 Community Centre cost Â£75,000.About   
 eight people helped to build the      
 community centre.Two firms supplied   
 the stone to build the Community      
 Centre: Barham Bros Ltd. gave the     
 Charlton Mackrell quarried stone on   
 the front of the building and         
 S.Morris Ltd. supplied the building   
 blocks.                               </content>
