		<title>15DAD'S LORRY FIRM</title>
		<content> My Mum and Dad own a lorry company.My 
 Mum sorts out the money and paperwork.
 My Dad drives a lorry.The business is 
 small,we have three lorries; a Ford,a 
 Fiat and a Cargo.We are getting two   
 more,we also have three drivers,my    
 Dad, John and Gordon.The buisness has 
 been running one year.We borrowed     
 Â£1000 from my Grandad.Since then my   
 dad has had 50_68 deliveries per day, 
 Gordon has our Cargo for overnight    
 jobs .My dad uses the Fiat to deliver 
 things in London from Horizon         
 brochures to Palets.John uses the     
 Ford to deliver in places like        
 Sevenoaks and Uxbridge near London.My 
 Dad earns more money because he has   
 more deliveries and he gets half his  
 driver's money.We have to pay for most
 of the diesel,but sometimes it is paid
 for us.The parcels come from Tuffnels 
 and V.N.S.M.                          </content>
