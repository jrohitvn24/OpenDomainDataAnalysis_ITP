		<content> The gardens outside each cottage were 
 looked after by the residents  and    
 there was a competition each year for 
 the best one. The houses were         
 decorated every 7 years and the       
 residents moved into another house for
 about 3 weeks while this was being    
 done. All the houses are decorated in 
 the same way, so they do not choose   
 the colours.They are built in a lovely
 red brick, with some interesting      
 twisted pillars in the porches.       
 Shops in the village include a general
 post office and a green-grocer. A     
 butcher and a fish van also visited   
 the village weekly. There was a       
 library, a hairdresser (who called    
 each week) and a shoe repair service.A
 daily bus service visits all the local
 towns,and this is very popular with   
 the residents.
