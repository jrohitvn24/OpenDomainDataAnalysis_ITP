		<title>11The Environs of Palehouse</title>
		<content> Residents of Palehouse Common are     
 predominantly elderly with only a few 
 families with young children. The main
 building of the High Cross Estate,    
 which was an old peoples' home for a  
 short time, burnt down a few years ago
 under strange circumstances. The only 
 disturbance comes from the main       
 road which is used by fast or heavy   
 traffic. The residents hope that the  
 bypass in nearby Little Horsted will  
 ease the problem when it opens soon.  
 Most of the residents keep dogs for a 
 feeling of extra security in such an  
 isolated area.                        
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
