		<title>09OLD PEOPLE REMEMBER MARSDEN</title>
		<content> Mrs Carr is our dinner lady.She looks 
 after us when we eat our dinners at   
 school. She told us that when she was 
 a little girl that shops used to have 
 groceries on the shelves and that if  
 you wanted anything you had to go into
 the shop and ask the person behind the
 counter to get it for you.The coalman 
 came round with a horse abd cart,and  
 there were hardly any lorries  or     
 cars.People didn't have calculators   
 and they had to add things up in their
 heads.People travelled on trams,and   
 trolley buses. Ladies wore hats with  
 feathers in them, and very long       
 dresses.She has lived in Marsden all  
 her life and went to this school when 
 she was our age.
