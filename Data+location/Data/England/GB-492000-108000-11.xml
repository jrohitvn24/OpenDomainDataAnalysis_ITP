		<title>11Eartham Church St.Margaret's</title>
		<content> The tiny village church of St.        
 Margaret's at Eartham shares its vicar
 with the neighbouring village of      
 Slindon.                              
 The flint building,although heavily   
 restored in 1869,still retains a good 
 deal of work dating from the early    
 12th century. The west wall of the    
 nave is from this period, although the
 porch is modern. Modern windows in the
 north wall of the nave disguise the   
 fact that this is also 12th century.  
 Although the church is so small,it has
 always been a popular place of        
 worship. We learn from early wills    
 that money was left so that lights    
 would be maintained before the High   
 Altar and in the chapels,and that     
 testators left sheep and cows whose   
 produce and progeny would also pay for
 these lights to be kept burning and   
 prayers would be said for the dead.   </content>
