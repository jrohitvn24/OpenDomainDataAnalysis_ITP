		<title>15ODELL VILLAGE</title>
		<content>                                       
                                       
 Odell is a very small village.We do   
 not have to suffer pollution here     
 because hardly any cars or lorries    
 come through the part where I live.   
                                       
 Very unfortunately many essential     
 facilities are being closed down.     
 For example, the Post Office, the     
 local shop,and the school are         
 permanently shut.                     
 We have a church and a castle opposite
 the church. The castle is owned and   
 lived in by Lord and Lady Luke who own
 much of the rest of Odell.
