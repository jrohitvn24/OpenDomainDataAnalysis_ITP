		<content>   Archaeologists have discovered that 
 people lived around Martinstown       
 thousands of years ago. Maiden Castle 
 was an Iron Age hill fort providing   
 shelter and protection to its builders
   Maiden comes from the word Mai-Dun, 
 meaning stronghold. It was invaded    
 when the Romans came to Dorset around 
 A.D 70.Soon after, the Romans built   
 their own settlement near the River   
 Frome. They called it Durnovaria. It  
 is our town of Dorchester. Today      
 Maiden Castle is both a popular       
 tourist attraction and a place where  
 people go to exercise their dogs,     
 enjoy the view or stagger up the      
 ramparts in an effort to keep slim.   
 The winter of 1985 brought another    
 invasion to Maiden Castle, this time  
 by enthusiastic tobogganists enjoying 
 the snow.Cows still graze the top of  
 the monument.                         </content>
