		<title>01Friday Bridge - Name</title>
		<content> One suggestion of the derivation of   
 the name Friday Bridge is that the    
 Monks journeyed to this area to meet  
 the Fen fishermen at the vridge and to
 buy fish for their Friday meal.       
 Another is that the wives met their   
 husbands at the bridge to get their   
 wages on Friday before they could     
 spend it at the pub. The stream,      
 called the Elm Leam that the monks    
 used has been completely filledd in   
 except for a small piece in the       
 village, that is now known as The Cut.
 It was left as a watering hole ofr the
 animals and as a supply of water for  
 fighting fires. The cut now contains  
 numerous goldfish.                    
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
