      Water enters Ulley Reservoir from
 Ulley Brook. This starts at Morthen   
 as Morthen Brook. It is piped under   
 the M1 and M18 link roads where the   
 name changes to Ulley Brook. This runs
 through fields and a gentle valley    
 until it enters the reservoir.        
      The reservoir is in the Yorkshire
 Water Authorities Don Valley catchment
 area.The dam was constructed in 1874  
 to supply water to nearby Whiston and 
 Rotherham.It contains 582 thousand    
 cubic metres of water,is 10.3 metres  
 deep and has an area of 12 Hectares.  
 The water was treated by filtering    
 through sand in a 'Slow sand filter'  
 and disinfecting it with Chlorine.When
 in full use the amount treated was 0.2
 thousand cubic metres per day. Water  
 is only taken in a real emergency.    </content>
