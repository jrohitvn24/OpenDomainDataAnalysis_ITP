		<title>13HOME LIFE IN BULKINGTON</title>
		<content> Home life in Bulkington features many 
 aspects associated with the country-  
 side, where we are made more aware of 
 the changing seasons. There is an     
 abundance of home-grown vegetables;   
 wines and preserves are made from the 
 produce of hedgerows and gardens. Most
 wives work in the home, some helping  
 with the family business. Many drive  
 cars, doing the family shopping once a
 week. Some meet regularly at village  
 groups, or follow activities elsewhere
 - evening classes,keep-fit, badminton,
 swimming. Our children enjoy the      
 freedom of living in the country; keep
 the more usual pets and productive    
 ones like sheep, goats, chickens and  
 ducks. In most cases, travel to the   
 town is an essential part of our      
 lives, but for many, to return home to
 the country is something we would not 
 change for anything.                  </content>
