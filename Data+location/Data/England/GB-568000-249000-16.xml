 believe his luck when a car he stopped
 offered him a lift....but his joy was 
 short-lived for he was driven straight
 back to prison.Luckless Simmond,23,had
 hitched a lift in a police car full of
 plain-clothes detectives.             
   He had escaped from Highpoint Prison
 at 8.30p.m.on Tuesday and was         
 recaptured within the hour.He was     
 picked up byC.I.D. officers at a      
 nearby pub,The Royal Oak at Little    
 Bradley where he was seeking a lift   
 from customers.                       
   Mrs.Dorothy Monk,wife of the        
 landlord,Ronald,said they were        
 suspicious of Simmond when he started 
 asking people in the pub for a lift
