		<content>     The village with two Churches, two
 Public Houses, a Post Office and      
 General Store, school and garage forms
 the centre for the surrounding farms. 
 Most houses are local stone built and 
 the village is a building conservation
 area.                                 
    Both arable and livestock farming  
 are practised, but there is no        
 industry and many people commute up to
 40 miles to work. There is a strong   
 sense of community with no evident    
 class barriers. Many social events are
 organised within the community and    
 held in the Village Hall. A Sports and
 Social Club provides facilities for   
 football and cricket as well as a     
 licenced clubhouse.                   
    With the pleasant countryside and  
 strong local identity, the area forms 
 a welcome contrast to late 20th       
 century urban anonymity.              </content>
