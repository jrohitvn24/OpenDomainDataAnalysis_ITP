		<title>11OLD  CHURCH</title>
		<content> At Broughton Green there is a church. 
 On the side of the building there is a
 bell.The church is a very small one.It
 may have been used as a school at one 
 time because there seemed to be a     
 little playground on the side.It is   
 now used occasionally for a church    
 service.There were toilets out the    
 side of the church. These were all    
 over_grown with nettles.There seemed  
 to be a little well which could of    
 been used as kind of water fountain   
 for the school .Inside the church     
 there were some kneelers and chairs   
 and tables.
