		<content>   There are 2 rows of houses on our   
 street, some garages, an allotment and
 a big playing field.  Quite a lot of  
 people have a patch of ground in the  
 allotment such as Mr Evans and Mr     
 Watkinson.  Everyone has a big garden 
 at the front of their house, we have  
 vegetables in ours.  On the house     
 front there are verges with flowers   
 and trees growing.  The people are    
 very friendly.                        
   I help my dad when he plants        
 vegetables in the garden.  Youv'e got 
 to be very careful when planting      
 seeds,they need lots of water.  We do 
 a lot of digging in the garden and    
 sometimes my little brother helps but 
 the worms don't like it as he chops   
 them in half!.  We have different     
 kinds of vegetables,such as beans,    
 peas, onions, and tomatoes growing.
