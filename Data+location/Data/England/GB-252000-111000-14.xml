		<title>14OUR HOMES</title>
		<content>     Some of the homes in{Merton}are   
 quite old.                            
     Martin Luxton writes---"Our house 
 is 200 years old.It has eight rooms.  
 These are a front room,a living room  
 a kitchen,a cold room,a bathroom and 3
 bedrooms.There is also an attic."     
                                       
     Many of the homes in the parish   
 are built of traditional materials.   
     Steven Watson writes---"My home is
 a small cottage made of stone and cob 
 with a slate roof. The walls are very 
 thick (about 50cms.) and this makes it
 warm in winter and cool in summer."   
                                       
      Quite a few of our homes have    
 needed recent modernisation           
      Douglas Padbury writes---"My home
 had no bathroom so my dad built a     
 bathroom on the landing."
