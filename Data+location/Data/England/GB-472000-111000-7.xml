     There had been a big house at     
 Idsworth for more than a 1000 years.In
 1850 the house was pulled down and    
 rebuilt two miles away because the    
 railway was to be built through its   
 garden. The house then belonged to Sir
 Jervoise Clarke_Jervoise.             
      The main house was pulled down.  
 There remains the coach house which is
 now a private house,the pigeon        
 house,the ice house,the well house    
 which had a well 300 feet deep,and the
 water was pumped up by means of a     
 horse,the game house,which is a large 
 underground room,and a walled garden.
