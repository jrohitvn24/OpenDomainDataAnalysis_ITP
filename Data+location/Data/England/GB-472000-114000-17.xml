		<content>{St. Michaels}is a 13Century flint     
 building. In the lychgate is a        
 memorial tablet. Inside are also      
 tablets to the families of            
 Clerke-Jeivoise, John Ball and Philip 
 Heberden. (Heberdens is still a farm  
 name). There is an arched piscina and 
 a font that was broken in the Civil   
 war.                                  
{St. Huberts}is set in the fields of a 
 deserted village. It is approached,   
 opposite Heberdens farm by a long     
 grass path which has a wooden bridge  
 for times of flooding. The church was 
 built by the father of King Harold and
 has a Saxon window and quoins. Inside 
 are medieval wall paintings showing   
 scenes from St. Huberts life,         
 including the clieving of a werewolf. 
 There are box pews and a Jacobean     
 pulpit.
