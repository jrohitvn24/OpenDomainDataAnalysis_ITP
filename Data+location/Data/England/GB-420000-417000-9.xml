		<content> Whitley is a village on the wool pack 
 route into Lancashire.Drivers used to 
 rest at the{Woolpack Inn}and horses   
 could be shod at the blacksmiths      
 nearby.The building which housed the  
 blacksmiths forge can still be seen.A 
 small coal mine existed near the      
 village and a distribution depot was  
 close at hand.The depot is still used 
 but the mine is derelict.Whitley      
 Church was built in 1847 and the      
 present school soon afterwards.The    
 village identity is secure in the     
 future due to the green belt.No new   
 houses can be built in the            
 village.This also means that no new   
 families are moving in and this is the
 major factor in the school's falling  
 roll crisis.There is a mixture of     
 housing types and designs in the      
 village.
