		<title>14The Village Fete</title>
		<content> The annual village fetes in Walkern &amp; 
 Ardeley are highlights of the year for
 the local community. Both are very    
 local affairs with a long tradition &amp; 
 are well supported. Money raised is   
 used for church maintenance &amp; supports
 a wide range of village activities.   
 The Ardeley fete is always held on the
 village green on the last Saturday in 
 June. The men of the village set up   
 stalls &amp; competitions with tractors,  
 balers &amp; ladders  &amp; the ladies prepare
 the teas in the village hall. In the  
 absence of a local celebrity, the     
 proceedings are opened by the vicar.  
 Stalls &amp; competitions are traditional 
 &amp; unvaried (tombola, quoits, horseshoe
 throwing). Innovation is not          
 encouraged. Consumption of scones, &amp;  
 cakes is epic. Anybody without a job  
 sells raffle tickets &amp; by 6pm the fund
 will have benefited by around Â£800.   </content>
