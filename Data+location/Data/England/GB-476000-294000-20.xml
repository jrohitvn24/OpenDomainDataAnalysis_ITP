		<content>{ Cranoe}is a hamlet of 11 houses and  
 32 people. The two farmhouses are not 
 in our block. In the nine houses which
 are, the post office is run by two    
 elderly ladies (the only ones without 
 their own transport); there is a      
 retired farmer, a widow and six other 
 householders who commute. The post    
 office is a small centre of community 
 life, as is the church: there is a    
 service every fortnight and an average
 of five people attending. All the     
 village join together for church fund 
 raising. Since the school closed 16   
 years ago, and the pub closed by      
 teetotal landlords, there is no place 
 for meetings: so Cranoe Grange is used
 for the annual parish and PCC         
 meetings, which everyone attends.
