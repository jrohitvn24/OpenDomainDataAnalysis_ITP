		<content> A SURVEY WAS CARRIED OUT BY THE       
 CHILDREN OF THE SCHOOL TO DISCOVER    
 WHAT THE RESIDENTS OF OUR BLOCK       
 THOUGHT OF LIFE HERE AT THIS TIME.    
 ALMOST ALL OF THE RESIDENTS LIKED     
 LIVING IN THE AREA BECAUSE OF ITS     
 RURAL SETTING WHILST STILL BEING CLOSE
 TO THE CITY OF SALISBURY.  THE POOR   
 BUS SERVICE THROUGH STRATFORD SUB     
 CASTLE AND THE LACK OF A PUBLIC HOUSE 
 IN THE VILLAGE DETRACTED SOMEWHAT FROM
 THE ENJOYMENT OF LIVING HERE.  MOST OF
 THE RESIDENTS DID THEIR MAJOR SHOPPING
 IN THE SUPERMARKETS OF THE CITY AND   
 VERY FEW OF THEM SHOPPED AT THE       
 VILLAGE SHOP.  THE FACT THAT THERE IS 
 NO SUB-POST OFFICE IN THE SHOP WAS ONE
 OF THE MAIN REASONS FOR THIS.  ALMOST 
 ALL THE RESIDENTS TAKE A DAILY PAPER  
 AND THE TELEGRAPH AND MAIL ARE THE    
 MOST POPULAR.  MOST OF THOSE          
 QUESTIONED HAD HOBBIES.               </content>
