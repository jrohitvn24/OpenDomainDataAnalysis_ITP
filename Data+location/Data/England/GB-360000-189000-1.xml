		<title>01A SUMMARY OF AREA 03600189</title>
		<content> This survey area is situated in the   
 lower reaches of the Severn Plain, 12 
 miles north of Bristol. Hence it tends
 to be flat and mainly given over to   
 agriculture. Areas are known to flood 
 though drainage schemes have helped.  
 The nearby Oldbury Power Station means
 the area is crossed by a network of   
 power lines.                          
 The market town of Thornbury serves   
 the outlying villages and a new       
 shopping precinct encourages people to
 come to the town, although some       
 complain of a lack of parking spaces. 
 The population of Thornbury is        
 predominately young. Many work at the 
 power station, Rolls Royce, Avonmouth 
 or Britsh Aerospace. The presence of  
 the M 4 motorway makes the area well  
 suited to commuting.
