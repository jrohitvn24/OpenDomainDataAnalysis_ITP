		<title>09Planning in the Wolfords</title>
		<content> Planning restrictions are very tight  
 in this area. Almost no new building  
 is allowed by county councils. In     
 about ten years, four new houses have 
 been built in Great Wolford, 1 in     
 1985. There is no new building in     
 Little Wolford apart from a converted 
 barn. In spite of Todenham now being a
 conservation area, two new            
 developments have been passed, one    
 after going to appeal. One consists of
 seven houses, the other of four.      
 Significant local opposition was      
 expressed, and the fear that local    
 people could not afford to buy these  
 houses has been realised; they are    
 proving somewhat difficult to sell.   
 They are however built of stone as are
 three of the new houses in Great      
 Wolford.
