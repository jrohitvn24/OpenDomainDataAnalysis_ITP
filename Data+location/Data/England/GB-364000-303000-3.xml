		<title>03THE IRONBRIDGE</title>
		<content>    The Ironbridge contains nearly 400 
 tons of castings. It was cast at the  
 Coalbrookdale works and erected by    
 late summer 1779.                     
    In 1775 the estimate for building  
 the bridge had been Â£550. The total   
 cost was much greater, Â£2,737. The    
 bridge was the first iron bridge in   
 the world, it quickly became a tourist
 attraction.                           
    On May 5 1985, during the          
 Ironbridge Gorge Museum Trust plastic 
 duck race, the Ironbridge was         
 damaged. People crowded on the bridge 
 that day. The police realised the     
 danger and tried to clear the bridge. 
 After the duck race, rivets and bolts 
 were found underneath the bridge. In  
 the future, to protect the Ironbridge,
 the police are trying to keep the     
 numbers on the bridge down to 200 at  
 large events.                         </content>
