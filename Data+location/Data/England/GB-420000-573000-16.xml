		<content> For our trip to{Beamish}we paid Â£46-50
 for 39 children and six adults to     
 enter the Museum.The cost of the coach
 was Â£32-50.We left school at 9.30am.We
 got there at 10.00am. There was a fair
 which had a coconut shy 20p for three 
 balls, Shuggy boats 20p per person,   
 flying chairs 20p and horses 20p. Then
 we had a picnic lunch on the grass. I 
 had egg and tomato sandwiches,an aero 
 bar of chocolate and a drink of fruit 
 juice, crisps and a trifle.In the town
 there are old shops, there are horses 
 and carts which cost 30p a ride. There
 is a tramcar line that leads out of   
 the town to the Transport Collection. 
 We had a ride for 15p. Nearby are pit 
 cottages. There is an old drift mine  
 where the miners worked, it was 10p to
 go into the mine. We visited the shop,
 then left Beamish, my family was      
 dropped off at the Travellers Rest.   </content>
