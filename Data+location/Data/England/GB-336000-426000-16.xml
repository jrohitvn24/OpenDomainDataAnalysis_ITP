		<content> When some Lythamers were asked for    
 their views they said they did not    
 like the untidiness.They criticised   
 the shops and the frontages.Most      
 people moved to Lytham through choice 
 ,though criticising the amenities.They
 thought the Beach should be cleared up
 by the Council.The elderly were       
 concerned about the lack of           
 entertainment for the young.Everyone  
 wanted the large Leisure complex which
 failed to open.Concern was expressed  
 about the roads the pavements and the 
 fouling by dogs.Most people thought   
 the shopping facilities were adequate.
 The general answer to local           
 entertainment was "WHAT ENTERTAINMENT"
 The survey suggested that Lytham has  
 changed for the worse over the last 20
 years.Most people liked the quietness 
 and the warm atmosphere of the        
 inhabitants.                          </content>
