		<title>20Sandringham Group Churches</title>
		<content> The Rector of Sandringham has the     
 responsibility for eight parishes and 
 six churches in addition to being one 
 of The Queen's Chaplains.             
 Despite this, The Church is alive, and
 there are services in all the churches
 on most Sundays and Feast Days.       
                                       
 The Rector can often be seen striding 
 through the villages in his Norfolk   
 jacket and cap on his weekly visits to
 the sick and infirm.                  
                                       
 In addition to the usual Sunday       
 services, there is a flourishing      
 Childrens' Church and the Group       
 Council arranges Lent discussion      
 groups and visits to Diocesan services
 in Norwich Cathedral.
