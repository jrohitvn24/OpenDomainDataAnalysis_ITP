		<content> As there is no cinema or theatre      
 within ten miles, the local villagers 
 have to organise their own activities.
                                       
    Children are able to join Girl     
 Guides, Brownies, or the Boy          
 Scouts or Cubs, though for these they 
 have to travel between one and five   
 miles to Pershore.                    
                                       
    Within Pinvin and Peopleton the    
 children tend to rely on the after    
 school activities offered by teachers 
 at Pinvin Middle school. These include
 soccer teams, rugby, basketball,      
 netball, choir, dance and drama. The  
 Pinvin Christmas pantomime is always  
 very well attended, very              
 professionally presented, and looked  
 forward to by the local community.
