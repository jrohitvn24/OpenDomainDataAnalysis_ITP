		<content>This is a fine example of {jacobean}   
architecture and is the most striking  
building in the village. Built by Sir  
John Langham Bart of Cottesbrooke,     
founded in 1668. The headmaster's      
salary   was 50 pounds per annum,2     
ushers at 20 pounds per annum and 80   
pounds kept by the trustees for        
repairs.It provided for  50 youths     
from Guilsborough,Cold Ashby,          
Cottesbrooke and a 4 mile radius. By   
1870 the boarders were down to 7       
youths. Fees in 1825 were 25 guineas   
per year. It was closed in 1839 and    
remained in decay for 19 years.        
Restored and re-opened in 1856.Closed  
in 1909.By 1929 partly used as flats,  
partly village hall. Now divided into  
three modernised flats,one further     
flat in the process of restoration and 
part still to be restored,the outside  
has remained unchanged.                </content>
