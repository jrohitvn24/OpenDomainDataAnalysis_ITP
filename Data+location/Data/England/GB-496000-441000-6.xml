 and several outlying farms.The village
 has a Parish Council made up of nine  
 members elected by its residents every
 four years.The job of the Council is  
 to provide allotments,street lighting,
 open areas and to assist Beverley     
 Borough Council on planning           
 applications within the village.It    
 also channels complaints and comments 
 about matters dealt with by District  
 and County Council.The Parish Council 
 has an agency agreement with Beverley 
 Borough.This means that the Parish    
 Council does not levy its own rate    
 from residents but applies to the     
 District Council for its annual       
 expenditure.This agreement also       
 applies to the Parish Council of
