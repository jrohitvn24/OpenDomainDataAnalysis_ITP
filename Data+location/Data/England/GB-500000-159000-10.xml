		<title>10General Occupations, Woking.</title>
		<content>  The occupations of Woking residents  
 are varied. Many professional people  
 live in the area. Parents of girls in 
 this school include locally practising
 architects, solicitors, doctors and   
 dentists. Light industries and many   
 market gardens border the area. The   
 James Walker factory makes packing    
 materials and provides employment as  
 do the many factories on the Sheer-   
 water Estate. A newly built Business  
 Park is as yet unused. The multiracial
 population help to run the municipal  
 services and local shops. Several tyre
 and exhaust centres and other         
 specialised motoring and electrical   
 firms exist in the densely populated  
 area between the canal and Maybury    
 Road. The frequent fast trains to     
 London make Woking an important       
 Commuter area and the railway itself  
 provide employment of various kinds.  </content>
