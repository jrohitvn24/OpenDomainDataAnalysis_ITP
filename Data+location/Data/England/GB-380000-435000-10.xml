		<title>10A TEENAGERS WEEKEND IN FENCE</title>
		<content>  Friday is a good night.There is the  
 Fence youth club; its 35p.An adult is 
 in charge.People aged 12-18 go.We     
 play pool,tabletennis.We also listen  
 to music.After the youth club we'd    
 either go home or hang around the     
 village.On Saturday i get up have a   
 big breakfast ,get dressed call on my 
 friends get my Â£4.00 pocket money and 
 go to Burnley town on the bus.Saturday
 nights are ace .In summer we can go   
 camping and stay up till 4am.         
         In winter we just             
 stay in.A Sunday in Fence is boring.No
 shops are open.We sometimes go on     
 rides to Barley.If its hot we swim at 
 Barley in a river.Its about 2 miles   
 away.Where we swim its about height of
 a 1st year.                           
 Sunday evenings are even more boring  
 it consists of watching T.V.          
 Homework has to be done of course.    </content>
