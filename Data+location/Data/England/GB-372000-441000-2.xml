		<title>02CLITHEROE CASTLE</title>
		<content>    Clitheroe Castle stands on a       
 limestone hill overlooking the town.  
 It was built shortly after the Norman 
 Conquest by the De Lacy family.       
    As well as the castle walls there  
 was a keep, a main hall, kitchens and 
 stables. There was also a church for  
 use by foresters and peasants. Today  
 only the keep remains, and that has   
 seen better days.                     
    Originally the keep was divided    
 into three stories. The first floor   
 was for storing food and the only exit
 was a trap door leading to the floor  
 above. The second floor was the main  
 living quarters, hall and kitchens. On
 the third floor were the sleeping     
 quarters.                             
     The keep could well be one of the 
 oldest stone built structures in      
 Lancashire, it will shortly be        
 celebrating its 800th birthday.       </content>
