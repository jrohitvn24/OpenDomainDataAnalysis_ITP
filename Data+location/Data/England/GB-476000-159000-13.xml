		<content>    We interviewed Mr. Leemans who is a
 forester at Bramshill.He told us that 
 most of the trees in our area are     
 pine, but that there are some         
 oak,cherry and chestnut.The timber    
 from them is used to make posts and   
 chipboard.The local forestry where he 
 works covers 4,5OO acres.Some of the  
 wood is exported.There are twenty men 
 and three foresters employed. They    
 work from 7.3Oa.m. until 4.OOp.m. most
 days but they sometimes need to work  
 overtime.There are four different jobs
 carried out.There are harvesters,     
 plank workers,foresters and motorway  
 workers. When the trees have been     
 felled they are transported by 32     
 ton lorries to various destinations.  
 The foresters have about 4,OOO trees  
 in every acre to care for.
