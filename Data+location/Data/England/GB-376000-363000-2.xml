		<title>02The Buildings of Brereton.</title>
		<content> Visitors entering the village of      
 Brereton from the A50 coming South    
 would immediately be struck by the    
 beauty of the{Bears Head Hotel}on     
 their left.Built in the old black and 
 white style,it was completed in the   
 year 1615,and was a stopping point for
 stage-coaches on the London to        
 Manchester route.It is still a        
 thriving hotel and catering nowadays  
 for the travellers of the eighties and
 every year is a meeting place for the 
 Cheshire Hunt.                        
 Further along this road is the centre 
 of the village,and visitors would see 
 on their left,a very imposing{archway.
 Through this arch runs the lane down  
 to the church of St.Oswalds and       
 Brereton Hall.The archway of the old  
 Lodges have always been a village     
 landmark and are often used for       
 photograhic purposes.                 </content>
