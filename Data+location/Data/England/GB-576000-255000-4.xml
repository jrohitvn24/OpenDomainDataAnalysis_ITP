		<title>04HALF MARATHON</title>
		<content>The third half marathon in Chedburgh   
will be held Sunday 29th Sept. 1985    
commencing at 11.00 am also a Fun Run  
starting at 11.15 am from the Erskine  
Centre. It is hoped that Sir Eldon     
Griffiths M.P. will present the        
trophies.                              
Unfortunately this year the Police are 
unable to assist or unable shut-off    
roads so volunteers are needed to act  
as Marshalls.                          
Proceeds from the race, by sponsorship,
will go to improving facilities at the 
Erskine Centre. The draft plan suggests
blocking the front of the stage to form
a proscenium arch and incorporate two  
dressing rooms to one side of the      
existing stage. A questionaire has been
circulated to each member of the       
community for their views on the       
proposed plan.                         
                                       </content>
