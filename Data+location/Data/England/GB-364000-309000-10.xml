		<title>10Religions in Our School</title>
		<content>   In our school there are 123         
 Christians, 50 Muslims, and 32 Sikhs. 
   We have discovered that these       
 religions have common beliefs.        
   They all have one God, have similar 
 moral codes and should strive for     
 peace and friendship between people.  
   Why,then,are there so many wars     
 throughout the world between differing
 religious sects?                      
   All the churches have school.The    
 Christian Sunday school teaches the   
 life of Christ,whereas the Muslims    
 and Sikhs teach arabic and punjabi    
 respectively,the languages in which   
 their holy books are written.         
   The Christians believe that Jesus   
 was the Son of God.Muslims believe    
 that Mohammed was the Great Prophet of
 God. Sikhs believe that Nanak was the 
 great teacher of God.
