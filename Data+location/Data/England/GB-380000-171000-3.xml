		<title>03The Army Camp</title>
		<content> A large amount of our area is covered 
 by a large army camp. The camp is     
 situated to the north of Colerne. The 
 camp was an R.A.F.base nine years     
 ago, but it now belongs to the Junior 
 Leaders Regiment R.C.T.. The camp is  
 called Azimghur Barracks. On the camp 
 there are houses for people in the    
 forces. The camp has four estates each
 with roughly 90 quarters.In all there 
 are 385 married quarters and 40 of    
 them are empty. There are 92 R.A.F    
 houses and most of these are on       
 Pinewood Estate. The facilities on the
 camp for families include most of the 
 Gymnasium, N.A.A.F.I., Post Office and
 Horse Riding. Living in the camp is   
 enjoyable and is situated in a nice   
 part of Wiltshire.
