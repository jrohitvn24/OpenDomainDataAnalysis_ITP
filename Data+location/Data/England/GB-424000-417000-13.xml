		<title>13FAMILY LIFE</title>
		<content>   My name is Louise Dawson, and my    
 family and I live on a{boat}on        
{Dewsbury Canal Basin.} It's quite a   
 good life just{pottering}up and down. 
 The{Calder}and{Hebble}Canal was made  
 over one hundred years ago and was    
 used for moving{cargo}about.  Before  
{engines}were made they used{horses}to 
 pull the old coal{barges,}but now the 
 canals are used for{pleasure.}        
   I was 10 years old when I moved onto
 a boat and I found it really{different
 from our{house}in{Leeds.} We first    
 moved on to a{narrow boat}which was   
 like living in a{corridor}but the best
 thing was that we could just go on    
 holiday when we felt like it. Then we 
 moved onto an{ex-Naval Tender}which we
 have built by ourselves.              
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
