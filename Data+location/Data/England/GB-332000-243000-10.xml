		<title>10Bredwardine; Education.</title>
		<content> There is no school in the area. Most  
 infants and juniors in Bredwardine go 
 to school in Clifford; those in       
 Brobury go to Staunton-on-Wye. Senior 
 pupils attend school in Kingstone or  
 Hereford. All the children are        
 therefore dependent on school buses.  
 The former school in Bredwardine is   
 now run privately as an Outdoor Centre
 (Bredwardine Lodge), and an earlier   
 school is now a private house.        
 Facilities for further education are  
 available in Hereford but             
 participation by students in evening  
 classes is severely limited by lack of
 public transport at the required time.
