		<title>19THE SHOPPING CENTRE</title>
		<content> Newton Abbot supplies most people     
 fairly sufficently but as we can see  
 there are too many{estate agents,     
{jewellers,drug stores/chemists}and    
{shoe shops}that are not needed.A      
 variety of clothes shops(for men      
 especially)and department stores would
 take the place of those other unwanted
 shops.This town has an{indoor market  
 which is held on{Wednesdays}and       
{Saturdays.}The{outdoor market}has     
 stalls that sell clothes,jewellry,pet 
 food,cards and there are a few        
 permanent stalls as well.In the indoor
 market there is a{dairy}part which    
 sells eggs,cheese and milk and there  
 is also a{bakery,}a{butchers,}a{health
{food counter}and a{sweet counter.}In  
 the next part of the indoor market it 
 sells mainly fruit and vegetables.On  
 the other stalls there is a mixture of
 other things such as books,brass etc. </content>
