		<content> Mr John Barff, Parish Minister for    
 Compton Greenfield, Pilning and Severn
 Beach has a large responsibility, is  
 very busy and doesn't have much spare 
 time. He came in 1983 after overseas  
 voluntary and missionary work with the
 Church Missionary Society at a        
 Theological College in The Sudan.     
 His wife is a doctor, they have three 
 daughters. He is a Governor of our    
 school. Mr Barff joins in Friday      
 Assemblies, and usually talks to us.  
 A typical day starts at 7.00. He takes
 his daughters to school after their   
 breakfast then works in his office at 
 the vicarage in Pilning until         
 lunchtime. He may prepare sermons,    
 choose hymns,write letters and reply  
 to letters. After lunch he may visit  
 the old,sick and needy in their       
 homes, hospital or prison, or sort out
 people's family problems.             </content>
