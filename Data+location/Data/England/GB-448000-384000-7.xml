		<content>{Todwick Grange}is a big house on      
 the outskirts of Todwick built between
 1860 and 1870 for a wealthy person.   
 It was once a granary for{Roche Abbey 
 together with{Brancliffe Grange.      
 During repair work old doors were     
 found which could have been part of a 
 Victorian house. The house remained a 
 private house belonging to different  
 people until 1947 when  it was bought 
 by the Coal Board to use as           
 headquarters. They needed drawing     
 offices so the school was built as    
 drawing rooms and it had lots of      
 windows for light. The house went up  
 for sale and was bought  by {Sheffield
{Childrens Department}for children who 
 can't live at home.Children who live  
 there can't go to a{Sheffield }school 
 so they turned the drawing rooms into 
 a school. There are 30 beds  and 20 of
 them are being used.                  </content>
