		<content> THE CHILDREN WANTED TO TALK TO OLDER  
 PEOPLE TO  DISCOVER WHAT THEIR        
 ATTITUDE WAS TO LIFE IN A NEW BUSTLING
 TOWN. IN PARTICULAR THEY LOOKED FOR   
 PEOPLE WHO HAD SOME MEMORIES OF WHAT  
 THE AREA USED TO BE LIKE BEFORE THE   
 MASSIVE DEVELOPMENT. IN GENERAL THE   
 OLDER GENERATION WERE NOT TOO HAPPY   
 WITH MANY ASPECTS OF MODERN LIFE IN   
 BASILDON.                             
 "WE HAD A VERY GOOD COMMUNITY LIFE    
 BEFOR ETHE NEW TOWN CAME. ALTHOUGH    
 THERE WERN'T MANY SHOPS WE NEVER      
 LACKED FOR ANYTHING. VANS WOULD       
 DELIVER ALL ESSENTIALS, BAKER,        
 BUTCHER,FISHMONGER,GROCER,            
 PARAFFIN-MAN."
