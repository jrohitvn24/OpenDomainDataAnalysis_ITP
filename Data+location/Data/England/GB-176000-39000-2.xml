		<content>  On Market  Street  there is a master 
 bakery, newsagent and  general stores,
 also the school and church hall, which
 occupies the old market house.     The
 playing field  next to  the school  is
 being levelled.  Along St Johns Tce is
 the  Post  Office  and   the   Devoran
 Inn,  once named  the  Commercial Inn.
 Nearby is the Methodist church.    The
 Village hall is in Quay Road alongside
 the surgery.  On Devoran Lane, not far
 from St Johns Church and Vicarage,  is
 the Driffold Hotel.   Further along is
 a modern housing estate,   still under
 construction. Along Greenbank Road are
 the Dolphin Link H.Q.,a tannery, weld-
 ed mesh manufacturer and a Funeral Di-
 rector. Devoran Filling Station  is on
 the A39,  beyond  which  is   Visick's
 Foundry and Boatyard. Also on the main
 road is  a firm  which sells  and ser-
 vices lawn mowers.                    </content>
