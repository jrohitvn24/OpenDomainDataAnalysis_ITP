 changed greatly,most for the better.  
 This is true in regard to{creature    
{comforts.}e.g.modern household aids,  
 services such as running water,gas and
 electricity (which are taken for      
 granted).Central heating,freezers,T.V.
 radio and the family car are          
 considered necessities.Shorter working
 hours have provided{increased leisure 
{time}with more opportunity for hobbies
 sports and extra education.Few are    
 unable to take an annual holiday,often
 abroad.Children are healthier through 
{improved care and medical facilities.

{education}is available to most.Social 
 services give a measure of security to
 the unemployed,the sick and the       
 elderly.In spite of financial cuts our
 hospitals are the best in the world.  </content>
