           {A LIFETIME (CONTD)         
 AFTER THE WAR THE VILLAGE GRADUALLY   
 EXPANDED.PEOPLE BECAME CAR OWNERS AND 
 WERE ABLE TO TRAVEL FURTHER TO WORK SO
 LARGE HOUSING ESTATES WERE BUILT FOR  
 HOME OWNERSHIP,THE "INCOMERS" BEGAN TO
 ARRIVE WITH FRESH IDEAS.              
   1985 THE CHURCHES AND THE SCHOOL ARE
 FLOURISHING AND REMAIN THE FOCAL      
 POINTS.SOCIAL ACTIVITIES ARE AVAILABLE
 FOR ALL AGE GROUPS-THE VILLAGE IS     
 ALIVE AND PROSPEROUS.                 
   WHILST WE REJOICE IN THE BETTER     
 STANDARDS THAT "CHANGE" HAS BROUGHT US
 WE MUST  BE EVER MINDFUL THAT SO      
 CALLED PROGRESS WILL NOT MEAN         
 URBANIZATION.
