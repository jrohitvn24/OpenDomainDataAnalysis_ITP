		<title>01HEMEL HEMPSTEAD INTRODUCTION</title>
		<content> Since Hemel Hempstead was developed as
 a New Town in the 1950s, the old and  
 new communities have become           
 integrated. As intended the new       
 neighbourhoods with basic amenities   
 centrally placed have acquired their  
 own characters. All the houses were   
 built to high standards and different 
 types were mixed in an attempt to     
 improve social integration, but some  
 areas are deemed to be more desirable 
 than others.   The town centre has the
 water gardens, free parking, wide     
 pavements and many shops but high     
 rates have forced some to close. The  
 market flourishes and is noted for    
 fruit and vegetables. People often    
 shop in Watford, Brent Cross and      
 Milton Keynes. Culturally the town    
 depends on London but has a           
 Pavilion,Sports Centre and F.E.College
 which provide activities of many kinds</content>
