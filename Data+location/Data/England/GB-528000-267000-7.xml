		<content>     The{Post Office}has been in the   
{High Street Fenstanton}for at least 50
 years.  Before that it was where the {
{village pond}is now. The{Hobbs family 
 have run the {Post Office}for about { 
{50}years.For{20}years Mr.Hobbs'father 
 ran the Post Office from his house.   
     Where the{double garage doors}are 
 there was a{Fish Shop.}It had an open 
 roof where birds would nest.It sold { 
 fresh fish and fish and chips.This was
 cooked in a large cast iron pan with  
 long handles,over an {open fire}.     
     Next to the{Post Office}now stands
 our{fish and chip shop}but,in the days
 of Mr.Hobbs'father there was a piece  
 of open land used as a{cattle pound.} 
  If a cow strayed from a field and was
 found by the{local bobby}or{farmer}it 
 was taken to the{pound}where the      
 owners could collect it for a fee.
