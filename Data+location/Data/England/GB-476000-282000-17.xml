		<content>I get up at 7.30a.m.I go down and have 
my breakfast.Then I watch some t.v.and 
after that I get ready to go to school.
When I get to school I play football   
and at 8.45 I go into the classroom    
then we do spellings.At 10,30 we have  
break.After break we do writing and we 
have lunch at 12 o'clock.After lunch we
have a 30 minute playtime.At 1 o'clock 
we do some writing in our folders.Then 
school ends at 3.15.When I get home I  
go to the shop with Adam.Then my mum   
takes me to town and when I come back I
play football with Adam and then I     
change.Afterwards I go into the kitchen
and have something to eat.Next I do    
some reading and then it's bedtime.
