<title>24HOUSING IN THE VILLAGES</title>
<content>

All houses have been modernised now to at least have the facilities mentioned in the 1986 description.  The majority now have central heating, most often with solid fuel, but some have oil.  Houses that were owned by the Council are now owned by Coast and Country, a housing association.  Some houses are now private rented by landlords who have bought them and further modernised them before letting.  Many houses have extensions into the back yards and have had internal changes in layout, so that they are more varied than they were when originally built.   &lt;br />
