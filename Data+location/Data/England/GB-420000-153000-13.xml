		<title>13Collingbourne Kingston Hall</title>
		<content> The present village hall at           
 Collingbourne Kingston was built in   
 the early 1930's on ground given by a 
 local farmer, the one stipulation     
 being no alcohol on the premises,     
 luckily since recinded.  The hall was 
 built with money from the Carnegie    
 Trust and the villagers themselves who
 have since been responsible for its   
 upkeep. To this end there is a        
 Collingbourne Kingston Village Hall   
 Committee comprising of members from  
 all the hall users. The latter vary   
 from Mums and Toddlers and Play Group 
 to Keep Fit, W.I., Youth Club and the 
 young Uniformed Groups.  The hall is  
 the centre for major local            
 celebrations, i.e.on the Queen's      
 Jubilee, Prince and Princess of Wales 
 Wedding, and the annual Church Fete   
 and Guy Fawkes Bonfire.  In short the 
 hall is the village social centre.    </content>
