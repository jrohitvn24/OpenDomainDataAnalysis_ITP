		<title>12The Seward Family's Sunday.</title>
		<content>Mom usually has a lie in if it was late
when she came in the night before but  
we all get up more or less together and
have breakfast. Mom gets ready to go to
work, Dad does the washing up and      
sometimes I help. Dad has a relaxing   
day mostly, unless the lawns need      
doing. I go up to my friends at Etching
Hill to help with the ducks and hens.  
Jill (That's my friend) does me some   
lunch. Dad does himself something to   
eat and Mom has her dinner at work.    
Sunday we don't have a traditional     
lunch, like a roast, as we are not all 
together long enough, the only time we 
are together is Sunday evening when Mom
comes home and I have returned from my 
friends,then we all have a shower or   
bath. Mom gets some supper then we all 
sit round the fire and chat or watch   
T.V. In the summer evenings we sit     
outside and have a barbecue            </content>
