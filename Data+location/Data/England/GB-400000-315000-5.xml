  There are many {animals} on Cannock  
Chase, including deer, foxes, badgers, 
stoats, weasels, grey and red          
squirrels and even adders and toads.   
Many rabbits also live there. They     
sometimes feed on the bark and shoots  
of trees and can kill trees by         
"ring-barking"; that is gnawing a      
circle of bark right round the trunk.  
Grey squirrels can sometimes be seen   
jumping from tree to tree. There are a 
few red squirrels in the coniferous    
woods.                                 
  {Fallow deer} can sometimes be seen  
in the quieter areas. There are many   
of the common {birds} to be seen, as   
well as the woodland birds such as     
woodpeckers, tree-creepers, and        
nuthatches. There are many more animals
and birds on Cannock Chase and they are
all very beautiful and interesting.    </content>
