		<title>03The school day in Thurlow</title>
		<content> The school has a fairly fluid day,    
 starting with assembly which deals    
 with moral rather than religious      
 themes. Group projects are used to    
 teach the younger children with more  
 structured lessons for the older      
 children. Project subjects spill over 
 into the school's social life, so that
 the American Indian project culminated
 in a Red Indain barbecue. Grace is    
 said before lunch and outdoor playtime
 follows. Role playing is not          
 encouraged but boys tend to play      
 football and model cars, and girls    
 skipping and chasing games. The school
 visits Haverhill swimming pool in     
 winter but has its own swimming pool  
 outdoors for the summer, and an acre  
 of playing field which has a problem  
 with moles. On Wednesday afternoon the
 children choose from a number of      
 crafts.                               </content>
