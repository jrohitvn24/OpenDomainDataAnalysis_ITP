		<title>04Silage making,Marchwood</title>
		<content> In our area the main type of          
 agriculture is dairy farming.Lots of  
 fields are used for pasture which     
 provides grazing in summer and silage 
 and hay for winter feed.{Silage is    
{better for cows} because it is more   
 nutritious and produces better quality
 milk.                                 
       {To make silage}the grass is cut
 while it is still green in late spring
 and summer.It is stored under sheets  
 of black polythene...the black absorbs
 the sun's heat better.Natural sugar in
 the grass helps to preserve it and    
 the grass is turned into a brown      
 sticky substance with a strong sweet  
 smell which is familiar in the country
 lanes around Marchwood.               
          Old motor car tyres are put  
 on top the polythene to stop it       
 blowing away.In a good summer three   
 cuts of grass are made.               </content>
