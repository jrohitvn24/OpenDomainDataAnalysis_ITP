 In our grid area we have an oil       
 refinery called the Depot. In the     
 village we have quite a lot of shops. 
 We have a supermarket, post office,   
 and a chemist.Across the estuary we   
 have an air base but the problem with 
 an air base near you is that the noise
 is awful especially when thay do night
 flying.                               
   In the village we have a garage and 
 next to that there is a cafe that does
 bed and breakfast.We are lucky because
 we have a Doctor and Dentist so it    
 saves going in to the nearest town,   
 which is Barnstaple.
