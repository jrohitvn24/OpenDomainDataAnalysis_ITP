    Thorverton is situated in the      
 south-west corner of our survey       
 square. The village is smaller than   
 Silverton with a population of about  
 1000. The land cover is mostly rough  
 grazing. In the village there are two 
 food shops and a post office. There is
 a primary school and three pubs; The  
 Exeter, The Bell and The Dolphin. Some
 of the pubs have restaurants in       
 them. In Thorverton there are Brownies
 and Venture Scouts, Cubs and Guides,  
 a W.I. group and also the Jam club.   
 There is a village green and a Hall   
 where a Saturday market is held. The
