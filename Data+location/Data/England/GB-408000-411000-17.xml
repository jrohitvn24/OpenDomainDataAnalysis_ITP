		<title>17Vine Products</title>
		<content> Vine Products is a factory that blends
 and bottles wine. When we first       
 arrived at the factory we were taken  
 to see the large vats that hold upto  
 2000 gallons of wine or sherry. The   
 vats were made of American oak, fibre 
 glass or stainless steel. We then     
 moved on to see the blending vats     
 these vats hold up to 250,000 gallons 
 of wine that are being blended        
 together. The wine is then bottled and
 labelled. The crates of wine have a   
 sheet of polythene put over the top of
 them and are then sent into an oven,  
 this melts the polythene into the     
 shape of the bottle top. The bottles  
 then go to a storeroom. From here the 
 wine is loaded onto lorries and is    
 sent to all parts of Britain          
 .
