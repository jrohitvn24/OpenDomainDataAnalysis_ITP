		<title>16Housing in Priors Marston</title>
		<content>    Priors Marston was designated a    
{Conservation Area}in{1970}in an       
 attempt to control development &amp;      
 preserve its character &amp; open spaces, 
 but extensive in-filling has since    
 occured &amp;{30}houses have been built.  
    Applicants for{planning permission 
 are entitled to that permission unless
 deemed detrimental to the existing    
 village scene. This is entirely       
 subjective &amp; often controversial.     
 Successive Parish Councils &amp; local    
 residents have protested strongly     
 against a number of decisions.        
    This is a popular{retirement       
{village,}and the high percentage of   
 over-60s keeps house prices high.     
   {Cheaper housing}for{younger people 
 is needed, but unless national/county 
 policy is changed to allow development
 outside the village boundaries, the   
 future of our{school}remains in doubt.</content>
