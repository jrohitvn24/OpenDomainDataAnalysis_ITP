		<title>01      GENERAL SUMMARY</title>
		<content>  Grid reference 02920069 covers an    
area that is mainly agricultural land  
and sea. The main area of population   
within the grid is Shaldon, a village  
which is to be found at the mouth of   
the river Teign.                       
  Our project was to be centred on the 
Shaldon area. Places of interest that  
we selected included  the Wildlife     
Trust, the Ness headland, Ness House,  
Coast View Country Club and Ringmore.  
We also studied the fishing industry   
and interviewed a local fisherman.     
  The area studied has 3 major sources 
of income, tourism, fishing and        
farming. In our survey we hope that we 
have covered all of these areas.
