		<content> Walkern used to have a butcher's shop,
 a general store, a post-office, 3     
 bakeries, 2 shoe repairers, 2 sweet   
 shops, a newsagent, a cycle shop &amp; a  
 blacksmith's forge but is now reduced 
 to the first 3 plus a hairdresser. The
 resident village doctor, midwife &amp;    
 policeman have also disappeared. The  
 village store, which also sells &amp;     
 delivers newspapers &amp; has a general   
 delivery service, is used by 84% of   
 Walkern residents (92% use the PO),   
 but the expansion of Stevenage with   
 its many shops &amp; supermarkets has had 
 an adverse effect on the small rural  
 shopkeeper. The community still enjoys
 a doorstep milk delivery. Ardeley no  
 longer has a shop &amp; the lack of this &amp;
 a PO is of considerable concern in the
 village. Weekly shopping is often done
 in Stevenage, Hitchin or Letchworth,  
 larger items from further afield.     </content>
