		<content>  Eaton Bray's school is a lower school
 with 90 pupils aged 5-9 years and is  
 part of Bedfordshire's 3-tier system. 
 Pupils from the school go mostly to   
 Middle Schools (9-13 years) and Upper 
 School (13-18 years) in Dunstable.    
    The dilapidated Victorian buildings
 and 'temporary' huts are a cause of   
 concern in the village. It is hoped   
 that a new school will be built soon  
 as, after 20 years of trying, the     
 school is now listed as a project on  
 the county expenditure programme.     
    The more modern Edlesborough       
 school, with 225 pupils aged 5-12, is 
 part of the Buckinghamshire system.   
 Pupils go either to the Grammar School
 in Aylesbury or to the Secondary      
 School in Wing.                       
    There is no nursery school, but    
 there are 2 playgroups and occasional 
 Adult Education classes in Edlesboro'.</content>
