		<title>02NATLAND VILLAGE CHURCH.</title>
		<content>{ St. Mark's Church}stands opposite the
 village green. It is the fourth church
 to stand on this site. The foundation 
 stone was laid by{William Crewdson}on 
 29th of June 1909, which makes the    
 church seventy-five this year. On     
 Friday 9th of October 1981{the Bishop 
{of Carlisle}opened{the extension}which
 includes a vestry, kitchen and office.
  Many of{the valuable items,}such as  
 Communion sets, were donated; one     
 goblet is inscribed 'Natland Chapel   
 1821'.{The pulpit}was a gift too, from
 J. Swindlehurst of Helme Bank, in     
 loving memory of his wife, who died in
 1906. The Vicar, Rev. Park uses 'Vino 
 Sacro' as{Communion wine.             
  The church is made of sandstone and  
 costs Â£3,000 a year for heating and   
 lighting. In 1909{the organ}cost      
 Â£25,000. Mr. Blenkarn winds{the clock 
 once a week.                          </content>
