		<title>13Fairy Steps Beetham</title>
		<content>    The Fairy Steps  is a well known   
 place where lots of tourists go.      
     The steps were cut in the rock of 
 Whin Scar many centuries ago.         
    About two hundred years ago the    
 people  of Storth travelled to Beetham
 where there was one shop .They  went  
 via Fairy Steps . There was an iron   
 ring in the rock face nearby and to it
 a rope was attached for lowering      
 sacks of flour and parcels on the     
 return journey.                       
      There is a fantastic view from   
 the top. You can see Morcambe Bay, the
 viaduct at Arnside  and  Grange over  
 Sands.It is a popular picnic area.    
    At one side of the  steps is a     
 deep, narrow crevice   in the         
 limestone which is called The Witches 
 Chimney.Children love  to climb down.
