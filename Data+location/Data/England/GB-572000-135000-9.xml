		<content>Most residents in this area of Kent    
are employed in farming, shops and     
services. One firm which has been      
recently established is Eric Albinson  
Design. They have converted the old    
Glassenbury Timber Yard into workrooms 
for making highly original wooden      
articles - clocks, jewellery boxes,    
mirrors and desk accessories. Eric     
Albinson recently won the coveted      
Crucible of Creation Award for a wooden
lap-desk. He has also got Design Centre
approval for many other items. One     
especially made jewellery box in walnut
was presented to Prince Charles. They  
are a small personal firm turning out  
beautifully hand-finished objects      
marketed around the world and are      
hoping to expand soon. The Timber Yard 
was used by the Glassenbury Estate for 
many years to turn their own trees into
such necessary items as gates &amp; fences.</content>
