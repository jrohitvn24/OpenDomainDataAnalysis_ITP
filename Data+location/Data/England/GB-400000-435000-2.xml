		<title>02Mr Robinson ( A farmer )</title>
		<content> My name is{William Robinson}and I am  
 85 years old.I have spent all my life 
 in farming.I am the oldest man who has
 been born and still resides in        
{Stanbury}.I have been working as a    
 farmer for 68 years.I wake up at 6    
 o'clock in the morning and,before my  
 breakfast,I milk the cows.I have      
 thirty six cows.I milk them twice     
 daily and feed them three times daily.
 The times are before breakfast.Then at
 nine thirty in the morning they have a
 second feed.I feed them again at four 
 thirty in the evening.When I have had 
 my tea I go to milk the cows.I work   
 full time and I have three assistants 
 who help me.Farming is very hard      
 work,especially during harvesting.When
 harvesting is over,the amount of work 
 eases off.                            
   In winter I keep all the animals    
 inside.I grow some turnips and oats   </content>
