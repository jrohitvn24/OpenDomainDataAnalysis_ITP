		<content> The people of Shenley and Whaddon     
 enjoy the village life of community,  
 peace and open spaces. Some like the  
 friendliness and others appreciate the
 privacy of this life style. Some look 
 with apprehension on the encroachment 
 of the new city, while others will    
 welcome an improvement in the public  
 transport and shopping facilities.    
 Whaddon, outside the city boundary has
 a Brownie pack, a youth club and a    
 Sunday school. The Shenleys which     
 identify more with Loughton in the    
 north are served by the WI, British   
 Legion, an over 60s club, a cricket   
 club an a dog training club. In both  
 areas the churches and schools hold   
 regular events such as fetes and      
 bazaars. Popular activities include   
 gardening, walking, horse riding,     
 jogging &amp; keeping fit. Children &amp;     
 adults spend time at clubs.           </content>
