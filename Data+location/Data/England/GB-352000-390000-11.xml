		<content>  DAVID'S FAVOURITE GAME               
 "My favourite game is called          
 'bung-off'. This is better if it is   
 played in the dark although we need to
 take care of the traffic.  The rules  
 are that one person stands at base,   
 closes his eyes and counts to 500 in  
 tens.  The other people go and hide   
 somewhere in a certain area.  The     
 person who counts then goes to look   
 for the other people.  When he/she    
 finds someone they have a race back to
 base.  If the person who counts wins  
 then the other person has to count the
 next time they play.                  
  RUSSELL'S FAVOURITE GAME is 'kerby'  
 "you pick a number and the lst. person
 to get that number is the winner. You 
 have to throw the ball at the kerb and
 if it hits it you get one point,if you
 throw the ball over your head and hit 
 the kerb you get 5 points.            </content>
