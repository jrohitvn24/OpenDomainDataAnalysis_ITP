		<title>15FIRE AT A HOTEL</title>
		<content>{A DRAMATIC EVENT}                     
 Earlier this year, the Boston Hotel   
 caught fire during the night. No-one  
 knows how the fire started;the        
 possibilities are that a television   
 was left on or an electric fire was   
 left too near some furniture. Luckily,
 no-one was hurt, but there was a lot  
 of damage and the ground floor was    
 completely burnt out. The promenade   
 was completely blocked for several    
 days and caused traffic problems. One 
 of our teachers was quite late for    
 school because her driveway was       
 blocked by fire engines!              
 Work began immediately on repairing   
 the hotel, and fortunately it should  
 be ready to be re-opened in late      
 November, 1985. It has been           
 transformed to a very new, modern     
 hotel after months of hard work.
