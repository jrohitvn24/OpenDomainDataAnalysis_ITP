		<title>17A DAY IN THE LIFE OF EMILY.</title>
		<content> At about 7p.m. my mum comes in and    
 wakes me up.We have to arrive at      
 school by 8p.m. as my dad is the      
 headmaster.Our school is a small      
 school with only two classrooms.      
 School starts at 9p.m.On Thursday the 
 girls go swimming with Chedworth      
 school.At the moment,Iam working to   
 take my Bronze Survival badge.We get  
 back from swimming at 10.45.and I play
 with Clare and Sarah.After play we    
 watch "Near and Far"on television and 
 talk about it.We have an hour for     
 lunch and play which starts at 12.00.I
 have a packed lunch.After lunch we    
 have French and Music.Music is one of 
 my favourite subjects.As our school is
 a church school we always say a prayer
 before we go home at 3.15p.m.         
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
