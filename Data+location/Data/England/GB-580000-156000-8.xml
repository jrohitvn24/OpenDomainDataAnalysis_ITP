		<content> This school is a Church of England    
 controlled school taking 220 pupils   
 aged 5-7. There are 8 female staff,   
 including a non-teaching head. The    
 school house, built in 1872 contains a
 hall used for assemblies and dinners, 
 a staff room and an office. The       
 classrooms are either hutted, wooden  
 buildings or mobiles with a mobile    
 lavatory block. The only playground is
 Tarmac covered. The only grass        
 available is a small area lent by the 
 neighbouring golf club. The school is 
 in an isolated position on the edge of
 the centre of population and the      
 narrow road makes vehicular access    
 difficult and dangerous. A new school 
 on a different site next to the junior
 school has been proposed since 1972   
 but government finance has never      
 allowed it.
