		<title>10THE PRINCESS ALICE HOSPICE</title>
		<content> The Princess Alice Hospice project has
 been the focus of a major community   
 fund-raising effort over the last two 
 years.The Hospice movement is         
 attracting a great deal of interest at
 present.Hospitals do not have the     
 resources to give as much help to the 
 terminally ill as they and their      
 families need.In the hospice,patients 
 will be able to die with dignity.     
 The Hospice is at the corner of Lammas
 Lane and West End Lane,Esher.Now the  
 building is finished,the Hospice Trust
 still needs donations to meet running 
 costs. They hope to add a day care    
 centre later.                         
 There are only 26 beds for 700,000    
 living in a 10-mile radius of Esher,so
 the Hospice will only meet a fraction 
 of the potential demand.Some other    
 parts of the country are not even     
 fortunate enough to have this.        </content>
