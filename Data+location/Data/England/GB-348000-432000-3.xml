		<title>03Broughton Waterworks.</title>
		<content>The {Waterworks} was established in    
1964. It employs 15 workers who live   
on the site with their families.The    
water is obtained from a series of     
boreholes which are scattered around   
the local area.Once the water is       
obtained it is softened because it is  
very hard.The water works cover an     
area of 3 acres. A viaduct behind the  
water works goes over a railway line.  
   The railway line is the {main line} 
which connects the South of England    
with the North along the western side  
of the Pennines.The line is very busy  
with freight and passenger traffic     
passing every few minutes.             
  Mrs Brown is the wife of one of the  
water workers.She says that the area   
is noisy around the water works due to 
the heavy wagons passing carrying      
limestone.A new {gravel quarry} is     
opening soon nearby.                   </content>
