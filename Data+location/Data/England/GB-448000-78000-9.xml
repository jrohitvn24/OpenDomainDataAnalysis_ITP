		<content>  There are three chapels in our area, 
 one of which is not in use any more.  
 This chapel is now a private residence
 called 'Gothic View'.                 
  The Methodist chapel is on the B3399 
 road near Gotten Manor Farm.The       
 present Reverend of this chapel is    
 Rev.E.Dudley Jenkins who resides at   
 Connaught Road,East Cowes.(Isle of    
 Wight).It is believed to be haunted   
 by a woman in white who only comes out
 on certain days at midnight.She is    
 supposed to walk from the old part of 
 the church to the new part,then to the
 vestry where she disappears.There is  
 also believed to be a spectre that    
 looks at you if you are on your own.  
  The third chapel is in Roud near     
 the track of the old railway.
