		<content>     Our area is a Rural area South of 
 Swindon. The only settlement is the   
 large village of Wroughton which is   
 separated from Swindon by the  M4     
 motorway.                             
     Farming mainly covers the         
 East/West Clay Vale which lies North  
 of the Marlborough Downs.             
     To the South of Wroughton the     
 scarp slope rises very steeply and is 
 mainly rough pasture. Wroughton Parish
 Church is built on a good vantage     
 point overlooking the village.        
     The majority of the Clay Vale in  
 the area is used for dairy farming    
 with a little mixed farming so the    
 landscape is covered by a pattern of  
 smallish fields.                      
     The South Eastern part of the area
 is covered by Wroughton which has     
 extended quite a way Westwards over   
 the Vale in the past few years.       </content>
