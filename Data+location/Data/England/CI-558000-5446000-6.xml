		<content> For the last few years there has been 
 a B.B.C. television drama series, set 
 in Jersey, called Bergerac. It        
 features Jim Bergerac, a fictional    
 police detective catching the         
 criminals who break the sometimes     
 special local laws. It was of great   
 interest to the islanders because they
 could recognize places used as film   
 sets such as the beaches and castles. 
 Bergerac is watched all over the U.K. 
 and has been sold to many other       
 countries bringing Jersey world wide  
 fame. The local people knew that some 
 things were changed for the programme,
 roads led to the wrong place and some 
 names were changed. The Old Court     
 House, a very popular local pub in our
 D block was renamed The Royal Barge in
 the T.V. series. Noirmont Manor, also 
 in our block, was used as the home of 
 another of the T.V. characters.       </content>
