    Trecarne Farm has 79 acres and the 
 building is 250 years old. The farm   
 has been owned by the family for 20   
 years. One of the fields is called the
 Clothes Line Field. Mr Lightfoot has  
 103 beef cattle, 3 milking cows, 83   
 sheep and 50 lambs. He grows potatoes,
 beet, corn and barley. All this is    
 used on the farm except the potatoes. 
    Some of the wooden gates are over  
 100 years old.                        
    There is a sea level mark carved   
 into a stone wall.                    
    There is an old cottage over 200   
 years old with a fire place  with the 
 iron cooking pots in it. There is also
 a mounting block that people used to  
 use to get on their horses.
