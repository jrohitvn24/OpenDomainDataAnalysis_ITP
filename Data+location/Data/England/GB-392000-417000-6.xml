		<content> Our school was in the fire path       
 and later on,the same day the fire    
 started,at about 10.40am,we were{     
{evacuated}from our school.We all      
 walked down to Littleborough High     
 School, even having to leave behind   
 valuable things.Our infant department,
 in a separite building, also had to be
 evacuated.                            
        Some people who had relations  
 at the High School were allowed to    
 go home with them,but the rest of us  
 stayed till after dinner when our     
 parents came down to pick us up.      
 Actually, we had a very nice Christmas
 dinner whilst we waited.              
        Many people were evacuated from
 their homes_including people from our 
 school.Some were lodged in local      
 centres in Littleborough, others went 
 to relations.
