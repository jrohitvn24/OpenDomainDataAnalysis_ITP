		<title>10Sonning Railway Cutting</title>
		<content>   150 years ago on 31 August 1835 the 
{Great Western Railway}was created by  
 act of Parliament to run from London  
 to Bristol through Reading. Sonning   
 Cutting is 1km long and is near Holme 
 Park and the A4.                      
   Building Sonning Cutting was very   
 tiring work.{Brunel}and his men and   
 horses were shifting no less than     
 24,500 cubic yards of spoil a week ,  
 but the weather  was terrible. Non-   
 stop rain made the cutting very muddy 
 and difficult to work in. One of the  
 earliest{railway disasters}took place 
 here on Christmas Eve 1841 when a     
 goods train including two third _class
 carriages  ran into a landslip in the 
 cutting. Eight passengers were killed 
 and 17 injured because the carriages  
 were open-sided. The accident helped  
 the movement to reform 3rd class      
 travel.                               </content>
