		<title>06HALLATON SCHOOLING</title>
		<content> There is a pre-school Playgroup at    
 Belton-in-Rutland, which some village 
 children attend - others go to        
 Uppingham. Hallaton is still fortunate
 to have its own Church of England     
 primary school, taking children aged  
 from 4 to 11. At present there are 20 
 children on the roll, with a staff of 
 three teachers. Not all the 4 to 11   
 year olds go to the village school -  
 over half are educated out of the     
 state system at schools such as Nevill
 Holt, Oakham and Uppingham. This is   
 more a reflexion of the relative      
 affluence of some Hallaton parents    
 than a comment on the school itself,  
 but the low numbers at the school do  
 make its future uncertain.            
 After age 11, children then go to     
 schools at Kibworth and Market        
 Harborough, taken by school bus.
