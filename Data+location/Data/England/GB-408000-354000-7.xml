		<content>     Thor's Cave was examined by       
Carrington who was a school teacher.   
It was the home of prehistoric man.    
They have also found things in other   
caves, such as Ossom's Cave.  Wetton   
means Wet Hill.  There is a church     
graveyard and the church was rebuilt in
1820.  There is an external staircase. 
There are stone walls round the fields,
and very few hedges.  There is a lime  
pit up at the top of Wetton Low.  Wakes
week is going to be revived after many 
years.  There is a siren in 'Ye Olde   
Oak Tree' pub.                         
{Housing}                              
     The majority of houses are built  
of limestone with the rest being of    
gritstone.  They range from very plain 
to very decorative, some being very    
large and others being very small.     
Some roofs are stone, but blue slates  
are most common around Wetton.         </content>
