		<content>  The local issues in our newspapers   
 are things like{Navy news},because    
 Portsmouth is near us.In our area     
 there are lots of trees  being cut    
 down and buildings replacing them.An  
 example of this is in{Locks Wood}where
 a shopping centre has been built.In   
 the centre there is a shop for every  
 shopper's need. In the newspapers     
 lately there has been a lot about a   
 man who got stuck down a well and all 
 the bricks and things collapsed on him
 and when some men found him they found
 he was dead.This happened on the Isle 
 Of Wight. We have done a{survey}of    
 children in our school about what they
 would like in{newspapers}.Twenty-five 
 people wanted more comics,forty-five  
 people wanted more popstars, seventeen
 people wanted more stories and fifty- 
 five people wanted more sport in the  
 newspapers.                           </content>
