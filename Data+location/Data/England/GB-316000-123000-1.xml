		<title>01General-area West of Taunton</title>
		<content>   The area is from Norton Fitzwarren  
 in the NE to Bradford-on-Tone in the  
 SW in the valley of the River Tone.   
   The principal interests are farming 
 (arable and dairy and beef cattle).   
 Other employers are Taunton Cider Co.,
 the second largest cider manufacturer 
 in the country, and the CEGB Fideoak  
 Transmission station, which is an     
 important switching station for       
 Hinkley Point and the National Grid.  
   Historical features are the remains 
 of the Grand Western Canal and Norton 
 Station which has been an important   
 junction since the GWR in the last    
 century.  Here the West Somerset and  
 North Devon lines (which were closed  
 in 1950's) joined the main line West. 
   Its people are mainly a rural group 
 concerned with agricultural topics    
 politics, flooding, footpaths, and    
 pollution -both visual and ecological.</content>
