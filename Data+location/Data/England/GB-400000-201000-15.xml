		<content> Cirencester is popular  because of its
 location in the Cotswolds, its old    
 buildings and Roman remains.Visitors  
 come from as far as Darlington,Bodmin,
 Norfolk and the Isle of Wight. Most   
 stay from 1 to 12 days. Some people   
 stay in caravans and some in bed and  
 breakfast. They nearly all come by car
 or coach.Lots of visitors we spoke to 
 came from abroad,from South Africa,   
 Australia,the U.S.A.,Holland,Canada   
 and Saudi Arabia. Most of these       
 visitors were only staying for a short
 time.One lady was staying 6 months    
 with friends.E verybody liked the town
 especially the church  with its Anne  
 Boleyn Cup,the old buildings,the      
 market and the bakers shops.Everyone  
 would like to come again,but some     
 visitors were disappointed by the     
 weather.                              
                                       </content>
