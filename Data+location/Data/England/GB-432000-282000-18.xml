{Coventry Gas Works}are in{Judds Lane} 
 between{Longford}and{Holbrooks}.For   
 most of this century{gas}was made     
 from{coal}and kept in large{gas       
{holders.}What{coal}was left over      
 was used to keep families warm and as 
 tar to make roads.In the 1960's       
{natural gas}was found under the North 
 Sea and brought in pipes to{Coventry. 
 Sometimes the{gas holders}are high,   
 sometimes they are lower.The{Coventry 
{colliery marshalling yards and sidings
 are behind{Bedlam Lane.}The{coal}comes
 from{Coventry Colliery}at{Keresley}on 
 a mineral line used for{coal.}The full
 trucks are kept waiting until a train 
 can be made up.The trains move on the 
 main line running to Nuneaton.The     
 trucks are moved with small yellow    
 diesel engines before forming a new   
 train.                                </content>
