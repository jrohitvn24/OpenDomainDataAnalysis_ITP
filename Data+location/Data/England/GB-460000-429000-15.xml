		<title>15A SELBY BOY'S SPARE TIME</title>
		<content> In my spare time I usually{play}with a
 friend. We sometimes play at his house
 and sometimes we play in the park.    
 When we go to the{park}we sometimes   
 play cricket, but other times we just 
 play on the swings. If my friend is on
 holiday I play football against the   
 wall, but other times I play games    
 with my sisters or watch{T.V.}When it 
 is hot outside I just play with the   
 rabbit, but on very hot days I just   
 lie down and stare at the sky. When it
 has{snowed}in the winter I play on my 
{sledge}with my friend, but when I'm on
 my own I make{snowmen}and throw       
{snowballs}against the wall. Also I    
{watch birds,}especially in the nesting
 season, and I make dens to watch the  
 birds from.
