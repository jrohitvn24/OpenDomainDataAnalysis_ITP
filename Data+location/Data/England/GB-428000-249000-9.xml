		<title>09A DAY IN THE LIFE OF-2.</title>
		<content> Andrew Wheildon is a 14 year old boy  
 living in Butlers Marston and writes  
 of a typical family day thus:         
 "My sister Heather collects her school
 books,while my mother makes the       
 breakfast.Dad had left for work at    
 7.30,before I had chance to actually  
 see him.He travels to work by car and 
 works for Automotive Products         
 Leamington,in Leamington Spa,about 10 
 miles away. After breakfast Heather   
 waits for the bus to take her to      
 Shottery Girls Grammar School in      
 Stratford,about 12 miles away,while I 
 wait for the school bus to take me to 
 Kineton High School,a mixed           
 comprehensive school,just a few miles 
 away.My mother cares for two horses   
 owned by a Mrs. Henderson at          
 "Westmeads",plus two horses and a pony
 of our own.That consists of exercising
 grooming and mucking out,most days."  </content>
