		<content>Next to the Kings Oak pub is a takeaway
food shop.The lady has been working    
there for 2 years,she enjoys her job   
very much.Buisness  starts around      
10.30am and closes when buisness stops.
The buisiest day is Sunday at about    
12pm.                                  
    They sell hot and cold food like   
sausage rolls,sandwiches,rolls and ice-
creams.They also open in winter.It is  
very busy in summer and tourists go    
there.They come from many countries but
mostly France and Germany.             
    There is no vandalism around this  
area and bikes are not allowed close to
the shop.                              
    They have not noticed any changes  
around the forest,except for there     
being more litter.                     
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
