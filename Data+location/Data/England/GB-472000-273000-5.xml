Home of Isham family for 400 years.    
Sir Gyles Isham,12th Baronet,died in   
1976 and left the Hall,its contents,   
and all the land to the Lamport Hall   
Trust,founded by him to promote        
"Historic and Aesthetic Education"     
Children can go and learn things there 
in the Hall or the grounds,the Church  
or the Nature Trail.Grown ups can go to
art exhibitions and concerts and       
lectures.They can join the Lamport     
Society.                               
  We went to the Hall with our teacher.
We went through the big oak door into  
the hall and she told us about the     
pictures.On the wall there was a flag. 
It had a red hand on it.There is a     
story about the hand.(see Page 6)
