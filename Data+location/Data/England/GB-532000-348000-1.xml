		<title>01Frithville and Sibsey Area</title>
		<content> This ia an area of rich fenland,      
 completely flat, much of it at or     
 below sea-level. Most of the area is  
 used for farming, growing arable crops
 or market gardening. Most land is a   
 part of very large farms owned by     
 wealthy farmers.                      
 Roads are almost completely straight. 
 There are three main roads, the A16   
 and the B1183 and 1184.               
 The area is drained by a series       
 of drains which are full in summer and
 nearly empty in winter.               
 There are very few houses, some in    
 Frithville in the N.W and the village 
 of Sibsey in the N.E.                 
 Most people in the area work on farms 
 or in drainage or engineering. Others 
 travel to Boston each day.            
 The area has very few facilities.     
 Sibsey is a growing village, with both
 old hoses and new estates.            </content>
