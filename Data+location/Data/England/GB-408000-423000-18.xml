		<content>  Two of Halifax's main industries were
{textiles and machine tool production. 
 Both have declined considerably due to
 competition from overseas.The{carpet  
{industries}were well known but have   
 declined in the last decade.{Sweet and
{biscuit manufacturing}are two main    
 industries.e.g.Rowntree Mackintosh. A 
 lot of Halifax's modern industries are
{small businesses}which have been      
 encouraged to develop.These are based 
 in the redundant mills of the         
 declining industries.                 
  Halifax town centre has just got a   
 new shopping centre called{Woolshops  
 built after much discussion with      
 conservation groups and the council.  
 They were designed like the           
 surrounding Victorian architecture to 
 preserve Halifax as a "Heritage Town".
