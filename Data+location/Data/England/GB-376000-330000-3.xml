The area is a honeycomb of tiny lanes, 
many of which are in a semi wild state,
containing a vast variety of flora and 
fauna.  Some lanes are only surfaced   
occasionally, and are used largely for 
access by farmers and local residents. 
There is one "B" road the B5026, which 
traverses the block and is used by     
lorries and other commercial vehicles  
as a link road between major roads to  
the east and west of the block.  There 
is a privately owned bus service which 
operates on Tuesdays and Saturdays to  
Stafford, and one bus each Wednesday to
Market Drayton Market. Part of an old  
coach road  exists in parts, wheel     
tracks are still visible in the soft   
sandstone.  Coaches used it between    
Newport and Eccleshall.
