		<content>   The base dates from World War One.  
 It was used as an airfield till the   
 end of World War Two. After that it   
 was a training school for pilots. Then
 it was used for missiles. There is a  
 street called Bird View Square because
 it was the best place to see the      
 missiles.                             
   Today the base is a housing area for
 U.S. servicemen stationed at          
 Lakenheath and Mildenhall. Nearly four
 hundred people live on the base. The  
 old buildings now house schools for   
 American children, hospital, furniture
 store, clinic and fire station.       
   On the base the currency in use is  
 dollars. Many other facilities for    
 Americans away from home are available
 at Lakenheath, including shopping     
 centre and even a newspaper called    
 "Stars and Stripes"
