		<content>Otmoor is a flat boggy fenland of about
4 square miles.It is roughly 194 feet  
above sea level.Much of it is wet all  
the year with streams and ponds.It     
often floods in winter and this year   
was flooded a couple of foot deep in   
early June.It has many marshland       
flowers some of them are rare.There are
also lots of rare butterflies.It is at 
the moment threatened by a motorway.   
There have been no proper roads across 
the moor since the Romans came. There  
are 7 villages round the moor but no   
villages on the moor itself. Some land 
near Beckley and Noke has been drained 
and is now farmed with crops. A few    
years ago there was a scheme to turn   
the moor into a reservoir but it was   
turned down.
