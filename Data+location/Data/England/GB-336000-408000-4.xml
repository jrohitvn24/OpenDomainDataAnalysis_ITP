   The Devil's Wall, as its name       
suggests, has long been associated with
mysterious happenings.  One recent     
story tells of two men camping on this 
spot.  After their second night, people
walking past saw their tent ripped and 
torn, but police found no sign of the  
men, then or later.                    
   Another story perhaps reflects the  
Civil War battle fought there.  A      
friend's father was walking at night   
when he saw a headless knight on a     
white horse.  It vanished into the     
darkness.                              
   There are two other stories - one   
tells of two large stones which have   
water on them each morning, more than  
can be accounted for by dew - the      
devil's washing bowl.  The devil is    
also blamed for the smashed crockery   
constantly appearing on the path.      </content>
