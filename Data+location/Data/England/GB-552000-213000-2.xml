		<title>02The Village Green</title>
		<content> The green is in the heart of the      
 village.  Hatfield Heath attracts many
 tourists, especially in the summer and
 you often see them having picnics.    
 There used to be people with commoners
 rights who could graze their cattle on
 the green and there are still two     
 people left alive who have this right.
 The village green suffered bomb       
 damage during the war but luckily     
 there is no trace of this now.  On a  
 Sunday afternoon you can sit and watch
 the cricket and for two days in June  
 you can visit the festival which also 
 takes place on the green.  We have    
 been told by one of our older         
 residents that no other village in the
 country has as many roads converging  
 on it as Hatfield Heath.  These are   
 roads from Harlow, Bishops Stortford, 
 Takeley, Sawbridgeworth, Chelmsford   
 and Matching.                         </content>
