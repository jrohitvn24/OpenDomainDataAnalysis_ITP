		<title>04EMPLOYMENT IN MILLAND</title>
		<content> there is no major employment in the   
 block in fact the majority of the     
 working population travel outside the 
 area to work-many to the i.c.i.       
 experimental station at fernhurst. in 
 the miland valley frming is still the 
 predominant occupation, although      
 concentrated farming like broiler     
 house chicken and turkeys need a      
 minimum of manpower. garages, small   
 shops and public houses employ local  
 people, and there is plenty of scope  
 for jobbing gardeners and household   
 help. there is an increase in the     
 number of self-employed contractors,  
 small builders, electricians and      
 plumbers. other sources of jobs are   
 the schools,stocklands riding         
 school,forest mere health farm, and in
 a small way the pottery &amp; furniture   
 workshop,milland forest crafts and    
 forestry and gamekeeping.             </content>
