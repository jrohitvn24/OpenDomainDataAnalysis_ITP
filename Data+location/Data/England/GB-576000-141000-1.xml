		<title>01General Description of Block</title>
		<content>   This block is in the Weald of Kent, 
 ten miles south of Maidstone. Kent is 
 sometimes called the "Garden of       
 England" and this especially applies  
 to our area.                          
   The main ground useage in our block 
 is crop growing, mainly rape and corn.
 There are many orchards and some      
 traditional Kent hops in the area.    
 There are a lot of dew ponds caused by
 the clay soil. It is a flat area only 
 varying between 20 and 30 metres above
 sea level over all twelve squares.    
   There are quite a few traditional   
 Kentish farms and there is a farm     
 museum.There is light industry and    
 craft such as coppicing at West End   
 Cottage and Cockle Wood.              
   Two of the squares contain part of  
 the village Staplehurst and the tower 
 of its parish church can be seen from 
 any of the squares in the block.      </content>
