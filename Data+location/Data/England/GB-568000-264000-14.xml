		<title>14BOYS GRAVE</title>
		<content>At a crossroads near Kentford on a     
small plot of land is the grave of     
Joseph the unknown gypsy boy. Joseph   
thought he had lost one of the sheep   
that he was looking after. His employer
accused him of sheep stealing. The boy 
was so upset that he hanged himself.   
When the farmer counted the sheep he   
found that non were missing. As was    
usual with gypsies the boy was buried  
at a crossroads. For many years passing
gypsies cared for the grave but        
recently Mrs. Angela Redshaw placed a  
wooden cross and puts fresh flowers on 
the grave every week. If you go past   
the little boys grave it is supposed   
to be lucky to throw some silver onto  
it. Another superstition is that if    
some flowers bloom on the little boys  
grave in spring a Newmarket horse will 
win the Derby.                         
                                       </content>
