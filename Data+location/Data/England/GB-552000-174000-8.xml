		<title>08  ATTITUDES TO SCHOOL</title>
		<content>                                       
 We interviewed a number of local      
people on their attitudes to school.   
Most people liked school as a place    
for meeting friends.  People preferred 
secondary school to primary school,    
and their most favourite subject was   
English,with least favourite subject   
being Mathematics. The thing that most 
people liked  about their teachers was 
their fairness, and teachers who       
shouted were not generally liked. But  
lots of people had liked school and    
would not have wanted to change it.    
Generally people thought that school   
in the 1980's were lacking in          
discipline.Nevertheless most adults    
interviewed would not like to be at    
school today and denied that school    
days were 'the best years of your      
life'.                                 
                                       </content>
