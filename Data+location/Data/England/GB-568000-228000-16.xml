		<title>16SIX APPLES CRAFT SHOP</title>
		<content> There are no shops in this area apart 
 from the 'Six Apples Craft Centre',   
 which got its name from the stable of 
 an inn called the ' Six Apples'. It is
 situated on the Wethersfield to       
 Braintree road. It was opened in      
 October 1976. The customers are mostly
 local people and tourists. Their      
 busiest times are Saturdays, Sundays  
 and Christmas. Their goods are made by
 local craftsmen and they offer a wide 
 variety.They only open from Wednesday 
 to Sunday as customers are few.
