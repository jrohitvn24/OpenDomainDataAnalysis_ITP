		<content> We did a survey to people's attitudes 
 to the role of men and women at home. 
 We found the following results:       
 Mothers usually do the housework at   
 home especially the cleaning. Shopping
 is nearly always done by the mothers  
 although children help too. Virtually 
 all work on the car is done by men    
 with sons helping occasionally. It was
 found to be rare that a daughter      
 helped Dad with the car. Dads tend to 
 take responsibility for the garden    
 whilst Mum takes car of the washing.  
 Most children make their own beds but 
 if not it is normally Mum who does    
 this. Things may be changing a little,
 for instance more Dads seem to be     
 taking responsibility for cooking and 
 often finance is worked out jointly.  
 Things may be changing but Mums and   
 Dads seem to have divided up the tasks
 in a similar way to their parents.    </content>
