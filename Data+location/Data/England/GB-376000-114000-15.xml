 There are four constables in the town 
 police force. They spend 14 weeks in  
 training school and another two years 
 on probation. If necessary they work  
 24 hours a day, but one police man may
  work 4 to 8 hours a day depending on 
 how busy they are.  The uniform costs 
 roughly Â£61.  but they have to buy    
 shoes themselves.The most common      
 crimes are theft,damage and traffic   
 offences.They have 3 vehicles which   
 are a motor bike,a van and a car.There
 is a magistrate's court which is near 
 the town square.Social services deal  
 with child care,fostering adoption,   
 child abuse as well as caring for     
 mentally handicapped.Hostels and homes
 are for these people.The greatest     
 problem they face is the growing      
 number of elderly.They employ 110     
 people including 80 home helps.       </content>
