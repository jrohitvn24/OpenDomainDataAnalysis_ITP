 Mixed School is less than five years  
 old being built to ease the number    
 problem at the school in the town     
 centre.                               
 The school has around 210 pupils from 
 5 to 11 years old with seven classes  
 at present.                           
 They have a staff of seven full time  
 teachers as well as the headmaster and
 a teacher for Remedial teaching for   
 half a week.                          
 The pupils come from the Low Mown     
 Meadows housing estate and from the   
 Barratt development over the main road
 while there are a few pupils from the 
 town centre.                          
 The school has a large hall for dining
 and play as well as a large field next
 to the school.
