		<content> The area is predominantly farmland.   
 The{limestone}rock is responsible for 
 an{alkaline soil}in which cereal crops
 are grown.There are eleven farms,about
 half of which are privately owned.    
     A number of{disused railway lines 
 criss-cross the area,closed as a      
 result of the{Beeching Plan.          
     The{A1 trunk road}cuts across the 
 area,providing an important link in   
 the motorway chain of the country.To  
 ease the problem of crossing this very
 busy road{a new intersection is being 
{built.                                
     There are two contrasting villages
 in the area,Upton and Skelbrooke.Upton
 is a former mining village,declining  
 since the mine was closed.Skelbrooke, 
 however, is a quiet sleepy village    
 which is inhabited mainly by people   
 who have retired.
