		<title>08Recreation in Newark</title>
		<content> A survey was carried out among        
 different age groups, on the          
 recreation facilities in Newark.The   
 young thought: there are not enough   
 facilities for the young or old.More  
 restaurants, cafes and cultural shops 
 are needed and places where they spend
 their free time.Entertainments,such as
 The Palace theatre  and the cinema    
  should be improved.                  
    According to middle-aged people no 
 improvements need to be made. However,
 there should be more "night-life"and  
 more variation in the facilities      
 available.They also think that there  
 needs to be more for the young.       
    Older people are satisfied with    
 their selection of facilities.        
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
