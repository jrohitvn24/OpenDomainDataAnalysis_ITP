		<title>07Transport Flintham/Syerston.</title>
		<content> The main line of communication in the 
 area is the A46{Fosse Way.}Flintham   
 has through traffic to surrounding    
 villages but Syerston is a cul-de-sac.
 There is a daily{postal delivery      
 service to both villages. Syerston    
 has a sub- postmistress whereas       
 Flintham only has a very limited      
 service - once a week for two hours in
 the kitchen of the Old School, quite a
 social event for the retired people.  
 Word of mouth is still the main form  
 of communication. Both villages have  
 noticeboards and a{newsletter.}Daily  
 newspapers are delivered in both      
 villages, a service organised by the  
 vicar of Elston's wife.               
 Most households have a car but a{bus  
{service}hourly along the Fosse joins  
 us to Nottingham &amp; Newark. A village  
 bus connects Flintham with Bingham &amp;  
 Syerston has a taxi service.          </content>
