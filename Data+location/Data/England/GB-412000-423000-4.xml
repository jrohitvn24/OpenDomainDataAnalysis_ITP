		<title>04VISIT TO GIBSON'S FARM</title>
		<content> We left school, crossed Halifax Road, 
 and walked down the hillside through  
 Sutcliffe Wood and into the valley. We
 saw horses in the stables at Sutcliffe
 Wood Farm. We crossed a stream called 
 Red Beck, then walked up a steep hill.
 We passed G R Stein's brickworks, and 
 at the top of the hill was the farm.  
 Two ladies met us there, Mrs Gibson   
 and her friend Mrs Robinson. They gave
 us all a drink, then showed us round. 
 They keep cattle, horses and pigs;    
 goats, chickens and geese. They grow  
 no crops, except hay to feed the      
 animals in winter. They also have     
 three dogs, to help control the other 
 animals.                              
 Mr Gibson has a full-time job apart   
 from the farm, and so Mrs Gibson does 
 most of the work running it.
