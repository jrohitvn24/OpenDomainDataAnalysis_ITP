		<title>15The Oldest Resident.</title>
		<content> We interviewed Mrs.Rose Reynolds who  
 is the oldest resident in Harvington. 
 She was born in Somerset ninety five  
 years ago.She was married in nineteen 
 hundred and nine and moved to         
 Harvington in nineteen hundred and    
 fourteen.She always worked on the     
 land.She remembers when the main      
 street was a dirt road,and she used to
 drive cattle to Evesham market every  
 Monday.She rode on top of a hay cart  
 while her sister drove,when they took 
 the hay to Anchor Meadows to feed the 
 cows.She caught the train from        
 Harvington station when she wanted to 
 go shopping in Evesham.It used to cost
 her one shilling.She lives in a little
 bungalow just up the road from our    
 school and the children wave to her as
 they go past.Mrs Reynolds still gets  
 up at half past five and reads without
 glasses.We liked talking to her.      </content>
