It covers 1300 acres. The land is      
limestone, clay and ironstone. Main    
crops are wheat barley and oilseed     
rape. barley is grown for fodder as    
well as for marketing. Some straw is   
burned but some is baled for feed and  
bedding. Hay is also produced.         
The Estate has its own Tractors        
combine-harvesters and balers. No      
equipment is hired from other farms and
none is hired out as there is plenty of
work for them on the whole Estate.

manager lives. This farm has its own   
herdsman and shepherd as well as other 
workers.
