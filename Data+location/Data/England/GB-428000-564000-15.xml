		<content> McIntyre Hall is a{residential        
{dwelling}consisting of 29{flats.}     
 Three of these flats house couples and
 the rest are for single folk.  The    
 flats are{self-contained}where the old
 people can cook for themselves.  The  
 flats are owned by the council and run
 by them.  A small rent is charged.    
 The hall is managed by a{full_time    
{warden}and a part_time relief warden. 
 There are also cleaning staff.  The   
 old people have to be independent.    
 There is a red cord in the bathroom,  
 one in the kitchen behind the door and
 one in the bedroom so that the old    
 people can pull when they are in      
 difficulty and the warden will attend 
 to them.  A cooker is provided in each
 flat.  There is a lift and a          
 staircase.  When the old people have  
 visitors, there is a room where they  
 can go.                               </content>
