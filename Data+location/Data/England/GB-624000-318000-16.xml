		<content>{"HOW LONG HAVE YOU WORKED HERE?"      
  'I GOT THIS PUB OVER A YEAR AGO.'    
{"WHAT SORT OF SERVICES DO YOU OFFER?" 
  '5 double bedrooms, a bar that sells 
 beers, wines and spirits, and a       
 restaurant.'                          
{"HOW IMPORTANT IS THE TOURIST TRADE?" 
  'The best way to describe it is icing
 on the cake. There are quite a lot of 
 licensed premises in Coltishall so    
 there is insufficient local trade to  
 go around. We get a lot of people come
 out of Norwich particularly from the  
 Sprowston and Eaton areas of the city.
 It is one of the places you can drive 
 into and see a fair stretch of the    
 river.                                
 The holiday makers give us a long     
 season, help us in our business.'     
{"HAVE YOU GOT RIVER FRONTAGE?"        
  'No I have not. The common has free  
 moorage for 24 hours.' (cont.)        </content>
