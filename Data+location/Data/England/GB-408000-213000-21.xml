<title>21Court Leet + Town Crier</title>

<content>



Northleach Court Leet continues, holding its annual men only feast every November. In 2004 the Court Leet revived the role of Town Crier, placing an ad in the Parish Magazine: I phoned the secretary and told him "I've got a trained voice and I'm not afraid to use it," and got the job. I believe there were few other applicants. There is a stipend of Â£100 a year. In the 1960s a town crier was killed on the road, when all traffic still struggled through the town centre. My predecessor, the late Mr Charlie Munday, was buried in his red coat but his bell and hat were kept. When I tried on the hat for the first time, it fitted perfectly. I'm one of around 20 women among c.200 town criers throughout Britain. I'd be entitled to attend the Court Leet dinner but choose, after 'shouting' the gentlemen in, to withdraw + leave them to their rare 'boys night out'.   &lt;br />
