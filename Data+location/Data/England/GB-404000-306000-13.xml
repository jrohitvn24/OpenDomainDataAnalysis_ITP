		<content>OLD MAN - Life is quite enjoyable      
because he has the money to do what he 
wants and the time to do so. He doesn't
use his education much.                
YOUNG WOMEN - Life in Chastown can be  
both boring and hectic. Many have      
young children to lookafter and this   
can be demanding. Many of them are     
housewives. Children prevent their     
parents from going out.                
MIDDLE AGED WOMAN - Many women go to   
work and their days are busy. They     
still have to do their daily house-    
work. They do go out at nights but     
their transport is limited.            
OLD WOMEN - In some cases husbands have
died and as a result older women get   
out as much as possible, to other      
towns. Many old women think more       
entertainment is needed for the young.
