		<title>16A SCHOOL CRICKET MATCH</title>
		<content> The Skinner's School playing fields   
are at Southfields Park (5841). Most   
of our junior matches are played on    
Saturday mornings. There are three main
cricket pitches: the senior square; the
junior wicket; the artificial wicket.  
 We arrive at about 9.30 a.m. for the  
game. All the boys wait for the masters
to arrive. When they come we all get   
changed in the pavilion. Soon the      
opposition arrive and they change too. 
We carry the cricket gear to the edge  
of the pitch. The game begins with the 
two captains tossing a coin to decide  
which team shall have first innings.   
 The match usually finishes at about   
1 p.m. and we make our way back to the 
pavilion. There we have buns and tea,  
after which we all go home.
