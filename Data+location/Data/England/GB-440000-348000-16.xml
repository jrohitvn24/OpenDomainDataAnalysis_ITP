		<title>16Transport in Codnor</title>
		<content>   Codnor is served very well by buses.
 These services stop in Codnor:        
    330 Hucknall to Alfreton           
    231 Nottingham to Ripley           
    132 Derby to Heanor                
                                       
 There is a private coach firm called  
 Dunn-Line with 11 coaches, and a taxi 
 firm called Apex Cars.                
   If you want to catch a train, the   
 nearest station is Alfreton-Mansfield 
 Parkway for direct trains to Sheffield
 Nottingham,Leicester and London.      
   The A610 Nottingham-Ambergate road  
 goes through Codnor so it gets very   
 busy.Traffic lights have just been put
 up to make it better, but the village 
 needs a by-pass, especially now that  
 the Ripley and Langley Mill ones have 
 been completed. The A6007 is the road 
 to Heanor, and a B road goes to       
 Riddings and Alfreton.       {GH/PS/CR</content>
