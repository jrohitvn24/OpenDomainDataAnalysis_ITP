		<title>04INTERVIEW Withiel Farm</title>
		<content> Maintaining ditches and fences around 
 the farm is essential. If the sheep   
 know that you are in control,they will
 not bother breaking out. You have to  
 be a far better shepherd on the hills 
 than in the valleys, as the weather is
 much more extreme.                    
  If you are farming minded, it is a   
 very interesting job. One of the main 
 problems is security around the       
 farm. There are many people who steal 
 the sheep.                            
  In the next 50 years, changes that   
 may occur could be an emphasis on     
 CONSERVATION. We would be encouraged  
 to plant a lot more trees, and many   
 more people will actually go out and  
 live in the countryside.              
 The farmer has only lived there a few 
 years and is modernising both the farm
 and the buildings.
