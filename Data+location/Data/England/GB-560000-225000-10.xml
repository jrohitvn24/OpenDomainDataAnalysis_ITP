		<content> In Great Easton there are three places
 where sport is played.The playing     
 field,school and the Village Hall.The 
 playing field is used by children.    
 There are swings,climbing frames and a
 slide.Girls or boys play football and 
 other games.Great Easton has no       
 football or cricket clubs.The Village 
 hall is used for Judo,Carpet bowls and
 other social activities are held      
 there. The only public swimming pool  
 is the school pool and this is only   
 used by the children at the school.   
  Once a year the school has a Sports  
 day where we have races of all kinds. 
 The Infants and Juniors have separate 
 races.The Juniors race for their house
 colour and the Infants run for fun.   
 Every one has flat races but other    
 races are optional.The scores are     
 added up and the winners get a cup.
