		<title>04THE RECLAIMED MARSH</title>
		<content>   A Freiston Shore there is some      
 reclaimed marsh. It has been reclaimed
 by the Borstal Boys. On the new part  
 they keep sheep, but on the older part
 there are crops.                      
   There are still concrete gun places 
 on the bank and by the road there is a
 barracks for the soldiers who manned  
 them in World War Two. The bricks are 
 laid sideways to build it faster.     
   There are two old hotels because a  
 hundred years ago people came here for
 their holidays,when the marsh land    
 was sand. One of them is falling      
 down and it was called the "Marine    
 Hotel" but it is impossible to tell.  
   There is still a bar at the         
 Plummer's Hotel but the ballroom wasw 
 closed a long time ago, though there  
 is still a bridge onto the old sea    
 bank.                                 
                                       </content>
