In 1970,some parents allowed a group of
children to use their swimming pool.   
Other interested parents started       
helping teach the children sports.As   
numbers increased,parents realized a   
need for a hall.Now there are at least 
500 members and about 50 more on the   
waiting list of each section.Members   
range between 7-18 years and may attend
the following sections:Drama,jogging,  
judo,swimming,netball,tennis,table     
tennis,football and badminton.The hall 
provides room for 3 badminton courts,  
plus spacious changing rooms,and a     
spectator balcony.It was eventually    
built in 1981 and opened by H.R.H      
Princess Anne in 1982.It is open on    
weekday evenings for members and can   
be hired for other occasions. At a     
yearly prize giving ceremony,members   
receive recognition of their ability.  </content>
