		<title>05BECKWITHSHAW VILLAGE</title>
		<content> In Beckwithshaw there are six         
 semi detached houses built about a    
 hundred years ago and new houses      
 built three years ago. These new ones 
 are in a small estate and there is    
 a small council terrace. Most people  
 have lived here for no more than ten  
 years with a lot living here less than
 five years.This is because there are  
 new houses built , but in the older   
 houses one person has lived here for  
 sixty years. Before living here people
 lived at Leeds and Harrogate and moved
 here because it is in the countryside 
 and quiet. To improve the village     
 people would like to see less heavy   
 traffic, a footpath on both sides of  
 the road and the speed limit          
 recognised.Others would like a shop so
 that they don't have to go to         
 Harrogate for things.
