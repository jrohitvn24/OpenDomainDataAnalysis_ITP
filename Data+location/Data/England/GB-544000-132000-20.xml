		<title>20COLEMAN'S HATCH CHURCH</title>
		<content>   The parish of Coleman's Hatch is a  
 scattered one with many houses tucked 
 away on the Ashdown Forest. The Church
 itself is situated on the northern    
 edge of the parish.                   
   The parish was formed out of the    
 parish of Hartfield in 1913 and the   
 church consecrated in the November of 
 that year.  Although the parishes     
 still remain separate, the benifices  
 were united in March 1978, and the    
 Rector Canon Peter Blake became Vicar 
 of the parish as well as Rector of    
 Hartfield.                            
   The church clock strikes every      
 quarter. It also has a peel of 8 bells
 which are rung regularly and are very 
 popular with visiting bell ringers.   
 The vicarage room in the Church       
 contains an unusual commemerative     
 board recording with thanksgiving     
 those returning safely from the war.  </content>
