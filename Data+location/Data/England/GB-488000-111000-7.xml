		<content> East Dean has a football team which   
 plays in league matches. Stoolball is 
 still played but only friendly games. 
 A Youth Club with a membership of 40  
 meets in the Village Hall every week. 
 Gardening is recreation for a lot of  
 people. The majority of villagers     
 still grow their own vegetables and   
 are very proud of their gardens. There
 are some allotments at East Dean which
 are rented from Goodwood Estate.      
 Walking on the Downs is still a very  
 popular form of recreation as is horse
 riding. The Mobile Library calls at   
 both Charlton and East Dean and is    
 well supported.
