		<content> This is dominated by Stickle Pike     
 (1231 ft.) which is just outside the  
 area and Great Stickle (1001 ft.) just
 inside. The area consists of steep    
 sided valleys with small streams      
 cutting deep into them. The major     
 river cutting the area in two         
 diagonally from top right to bottom   
 left is the Lickle, a fine trout      
 river. The sides of the valleys are   
 for the most part open fell punctuated
 by craggy outcrops of rock with the   
 occasional sites of quarries spewing  
 spoil down the fellside. In the valley
 bottoms are located farms which for   
 the most part farm sheep on the fells 
 and grow silage and hay on the better 
 lowland fields for their winter keep. 
 There are also many patches of        
 deciduous woodland and the area is    
 bordered on the east by a huge        
 coniferous forest.                    </content>
