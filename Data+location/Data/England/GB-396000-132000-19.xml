		<title>19TOURISM IN CHILMARK/TEFFONT</title>
		<content>{Chilmark}and{Teffont Magna}lie on     
{one }of the chief routes westward from
 Salisbury, nowadays called the B3089. 
 An ancient road, the{Oxdrove,}lies    
 two miles north of the villages and   
 the A303 a mile futher north. Many    
 travellers must have passed along     
 these routes and stopped at the{Black 
{Dog Inn}since it was built in the 15th
 century. The{Chilmark Garage}with full
 servicing facilities and petrol is    
 only 50 yards from the inn. Visitors  
 come to the area not only on their way
 to the west, but from America,        
 especially from Chilmark, Massachusets
 to visit ancestors in the churchyard. 
{Ponytrekkers}from{Codford}in the      
 Wylye valley have lunch at the Black  
 Dog and visitors come to shoot deer   
 with local landowners.
