		<title>03Shirley-The Resident's View.</title>
		<content> We asked people who lived in Shirley  
 the following questions:              
{What improvements would you like to   
{see?}                                 
 More amenities for young people are   
 needed and this might help reduce     
 vandalism.A social club for adults is 
 needed as well, as they only have the 
 British Legion.Also elderly people    
 need more care and more frequent      
 visits from the Welfare.              
{What could be done about vandalism?}  
 More police walking the beat and not  
 in cars would be a start,and the      
 police should pay more attention to   
 Shirley and less to Solihull.         
{What do you think about the closure of
{Sharman's Cross School?}              
 It has a history of good education    
 and should not be closed.Pupils from  
 Shirley would then have to travel much
 further to get to school.             </content>
