		<content> A lttle further up, still opposite the
 pool, are the New Row Cottages. They  
 were built about 1830, and have been  
 known locally as 'Upper Row' cottages.
 Again they were built by the Coal-    
 brookdale Co., for the "principal     
 workmen" and were generally regarded  
 as 'better class' cottages.           
 The most famous resident of the Old   
 Row, living at number 6, was William  
 Ball. He is synonomous with 'John     
 Bull'. In the mid-nineteenth century, 
 he worked as a puddler for the Coal-  
 brookdale Co. for 40 years  and was a 
 man of enormous proportions. He       
 weighed over 40 stones, but was only  
 5'-9" high, yet his chest measured 70"
 and his stomach 80", whilst his neck  
 had a circumference of 23". His house 
 is currently lived in by a man from   
 Walsall, who has been here 18 months.
