		<content>   Jim Rickard is my Grandad, he owns  
 the Bell Inn. The Bell Inn is 700     
 years old and its was built in        
 1300.The dinning room used to be the  
 old blacksmith shop where they shoed  
 all the horses long ago.In the grounds
 there is a holiday cottage which was  
 converted from the old granary which  
 was where they stored the grain to    
 keep it dry. Outside there is a       
 thatched roof. In side is an old open 
 fire and there are antique chairs and 
 table. There is a new bar it is       
 covered with copper. Games are played 
 in the pub such as darts and a card   
 game called euchre.In the ladies darts
 team there are six ladies and in the  
 mens darts team there are eight men.  
 My mum works at the pub she does the  
 cooking. There is a little garden with
 seats &amp; tables.
