		<title>12  OUR LOCAL SHOP - CALNE</title>
		<content> In Brown's shop they sell books and   
 sweets, pens and pencils, they sell   
 football stickers and comics and toys.
 They sell batteries and ornaments, and
 they sell towels.They sell some food  
 like eggs, biscuits,bacon, breakfast  
 things, potatoes and cakes.I go in    
 Brown's shop every day after school   
 and I buy sweets and my mum buys      
 apples and cakes and some crisps. My  
 mum uses Brown's shop when she has    
 forgotten something. My mum gets her  
 shopping from the supermarket,        
 Gateways in town. We usually buy our  
 clothes from the market which comes to
 Calne every Friday, or from Swindon.  
 We go to Swindon on the bus.
