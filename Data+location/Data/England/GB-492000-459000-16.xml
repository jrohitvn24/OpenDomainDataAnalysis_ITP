		<title>16Wetwang,Housing</title>
		<content>      There is all sorts of housing in 
 Wetwang but no flats.Some of the      
 houses are old and some are new.      
      Many of the houses in the Main   
 Street are old farmhouses and cottages
 that have been done up.Alot of them   
 are partly built of chalk and they    
 have tile roofs.Between them are some 
 newer houses and bungalows.           
      The houses in Northfield Road are
 newer and they are mainly occupied by 
 older and retired people with a few   
 families.                             
      Although Wetwang is a development
 area there is not much room in the    
 north part of the village for any more
 houses.Much of the Main Street is a   
 conservation area.                    
      In the rest of this area are some
 isolated farmhouses and farm cottages.
