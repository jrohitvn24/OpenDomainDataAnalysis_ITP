		<title>14Survey on the Village Shop</title>
		<content>In Ellastone there is a population     
of 250 people,  The shops in Ellastone 
are a Butchers, a craft shop and a     
general  village store, which sells    
groceries, bread and newspapers etc and
is also a Post Office.We did a shopping
survey and five children stood outside 
and we all asked three people          
questions. First we asked where they   
came from:   5 of these people lived   
in the village.                        
  7 people lived in a neighbouring     
village.                               
  3 were holiday makers.               
We asked how often they used the shop: 
  8 people used the shop every day.    
  5 used it 2 or 3 times each week.    
  3 used it less often.                
We asked if they would like any more   
shops:   13 people said no.            
 2 people said yes they would like a   
tea shop.                              </content>
