		<content> Deciduous trees, especially oaks, do  
 well here but wildlife has suffered   
 from the removal of hedges by farmers,
 the cutting of verges by the council, 
 the filling in of ponds and the use   
 of pesticides and herbicides. Flowers 
 such as orchids, Ragged Robin and     
 poppies, once common, are almost gone.
 Apart from magpies and Canada geese,  
 most bird species are declining, but  
 foxes proliferate, as do rabbits along
 the railway, despite endemic          
 myxomatosis. Mink are now a pest,     
 living in ponds and rivers where they 
 prey on fish and waterfowl. January   
 1985 was exceptionally cold, with icy 
 east winds which killed even mature   
 trees, brambles and gorse. Wild life  
 is, however, cherished by many local  
 people who encourage birds and animals
 in their gardens; bats, frogs, hares  
 and owls all have their friends.      </content>
