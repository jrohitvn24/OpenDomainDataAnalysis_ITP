		<content> Cuddington, Gibaltar and Nether       
 Winchendon are located in a           
 predominately rural area of           
 buckingamshire on two limestone ridges
 separated by the floodplain of the    
 river thame.  They are nucleated      
 settlements surrounded by arable      
 farmland.  Cuddington (poulation 623) 
 has recently grown within conserved   
 areas of the village by the           
 development of disused farm buildings 
 and the infilling of new homes between
 existing whchert cottages.  8% of the 
 population earn their living in the   
 village, most travelling to Haddenham,
 Aylesbury of London for employment.   
 Only 62% have lived in cuddinton form 
 more than five years.  Nether         
 Winchendon (pop 140) has retained much
 of the appearance of any estate       
 village as many cottages were tied,   
 until recently, to Nether Winchendon  </content>
