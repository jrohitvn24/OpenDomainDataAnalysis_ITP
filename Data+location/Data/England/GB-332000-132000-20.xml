		<title>20A MESSAGE FROM 1985</title>
		<content> Dear People of the Future,Greetings   
 from the 20th Century.We're sending   
 this message to you through The       
 Domesday Disc.Children weren't as     
 lucky 900 years ago as we are in our  
 country today.We have good health,food
 toys,&amp; education.However in many lands
 famine,war,disease are common.        
 Bob Geldof and good people world wide 
 are trying to help Africa,s great     
 famine. The EEC has grain,butter and  
 meat mountains and he has told them to
 help.                                 
  This year we remembered the Last     
 Battle on English soil.Today we worry 
 about nuclear war'pollution and new   
 diseases.We hope that in your time all
 of these problems will be solved and  
 that there will be lasting peace.We   
 are just begining to travel into space
 you may well take it as normal.We hope
 that peace will prevail there also.   </content>
