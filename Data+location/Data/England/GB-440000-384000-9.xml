		<title>09EDUCATION IN THE l980's</title>
		<content>   School in the l980's ran from Monday
 to Friday.  You would have to be there
 for 9.00 a.m. and leave at 3.30 p.m. I
 am writing about Brunswick Middle     
 School which is a school in the       
 village of Woodhouse and has a        
 capacity of around 240 children.  In  
 the mornings we learn mathematics and 
 English. At twelve o'clock we have our
 dinner.  At one o'clock we start      
 lessons again such as science,        
 environmental studies, religious      
 education and we have a spelling test 
 every Friday. We also have physical   
 education which is exercises and we   
 play games such as rounders and       
 netball. We have a break after        
 mathematics, at dinner time and during
 the afternoon.
