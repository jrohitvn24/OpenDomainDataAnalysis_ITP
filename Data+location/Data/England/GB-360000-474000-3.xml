		<content> Because of the high rainfall area, and
 the small size and roughness of the   
 fields, cereal crops are not often    
 grown. Farms are either mixed, dairy, 
 beef,sheep or further up the fell,    
 sheep farming with perhaps suckler    
 cows.There is too much milk produced  
 in the E.E.C.so farmers are now       
 encouraged to go out of milk          
 production and concentrate on beef    
 farming. Some of the older farmers who
 want life a little easier do this     
 Sometimes beef cows are sold as store 
 cattle to farmers further down Lanca- 
 shire to fatten off on better land.   
 There is very little poultry and pig  
 farming. The biggest number of animals
 on farms in our area is sheep followed
 by dairy cattle followed by beef      
 cattle. The only crop apart from hay  
 and silage is a few acres of barley.
