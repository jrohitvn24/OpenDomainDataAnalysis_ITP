		<title>01SUMMARY OF 'D' BLOCK</title>
		<content>       Our block is mostly sea,which is
 called Falmouth Bay.It is in the South
 West of England,in Cornwall.People    
 come to Falmouth,because it is near to
 the sea for boats.The weather is      
 normally mild.We hardly ever get lots 
 of snow,or much frost,but we get lots 
 of rain.                              
  The summer is the best of the year in
{Falmouth }because you can use the     
 beaches for sunbathing and swimming.  
 We have several different beaches in  
 our block,and our quite sandy.        
  Falmouth is very popular with holiday
 makers.It has the usual conveniences  
 such as shops,hospitals,parks,public  
 houses,youth clubs,cinema,but also has
 a castle,caravan and camping          
 sites,holiday flats and nice walks by 
 the sea.{
