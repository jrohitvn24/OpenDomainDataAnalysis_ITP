		<content>Close to St Lawrence's Church stands   
the old school in which is a stone     
tablet which reads:"This building for  
the instruction of the young in piety  
and usefulness was erected in memory   
of George Jacson,Esq.1848".            
                                       
The new school lies to the north of    
the church and is seperated from it    
by Barton Grange Hotel and Garden      
Centre. The school was opened in 1960. 
It has its own playing field alongside 
Garstang Road and the main entrance is 
in Jepps Avenue.                       
                                       
Closure of the school has recently     
been suggested by a working party set  
up by Lancashire County Council but    
the school will be open as usual on the
first day of term in September 1985.
