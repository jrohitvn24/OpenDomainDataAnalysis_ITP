		<title>08Alston Sutton Farm</title>
		<content> Alston Sutton farm is very large.It   
 has 350 acres of land altogether.Most 
 of the buildings are made of bricks   
 but some are made of stone.The farmer 
 who lives there has seven helpers.He  
 usually  gets up at 5a.m. to milk the 
 cows in the herring bone milking      
 parlour.The farm has 200 Friesian     
 milking cows.The milk is filtered and 
 stored in a large tank. The milking   
 takes until 8a.m.and then everything  
 has to be washed ready for the        
 evening.The milking cows go out in to 
 the fields afterwards.In the field    
 with them is a Blonde Aquitaine bull. 
   Cows are not the only animals on the
 farm.There are 150 calves,yearlings   
 and heifers and some beef cattle too. 
 The Aberdeen Angus spends his time in 
 the fields with the beef cattle.The   
 farmer also has about 180 sheep which 
 have lambs every year.                </content>
