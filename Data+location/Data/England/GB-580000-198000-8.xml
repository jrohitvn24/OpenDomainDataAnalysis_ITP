		<content>    Although most people in the new    
 town of South Woodham Ferrers find    
 work by commuting, about 5 years ago a
 factory estate was established. Many  
 small products are produced, including
 patio doors  and window frames,       
 upholstery for furniture and labels.  
    We visited Glenco Products, a      
 plastics factory. They produce such   
 things as flower pots, hanging        
 baskets, dog and cat bowls and litter 
 trays. Mr Ball, the managing director,
 employs 25 people who either work on  
 the 13 machines, on packing or load-  
 ing.                                  
    They receive orders from nurseries,
 garden centres, Asda, Woolworths and  
 pet shops. Orders come also from      
 Holland, Switzerland and Finland.     
    The business has increased greatly 
 in five years and we liked the happy  
 working atmosphere.                   </content>
