		<content> Being part of the Furness Peninsular  
 our block has a varied geology        
 comprising limestoneand slate.The     
 highest part of our area consists of  
 low,rounded,glaciated hills,containing
 many deep tree-lined gills.Many of the
 upland valleys have been flooded to   
 provide reservoirs for urban areas.The
 moorland areas are used mainly for    
 sssssheep grazing but the lower slopes
 for pasture,dairy and beef            
 farming.Very little land is used for  
 arable farming.The arae is transected 
 by the Barrow-Lancaster railway and   
 the A590 trunk road,both major        
 transport routes.The housing is       
 varied,spanning from traditional stone
 cottages to modern bungalows.At       
 present much building is taking       
 place,but many locals resent the new  
 estates for fear of loosing the areas'
 rural character.                      </content>
