		<content>  In our area patrols only take place  
 occasionally and then an area car is  
 used.  Sometimes a one-man car        
 will patrol the area. There are       
 several village policemen in our D    
 block and they patrol   constantly.   
    Crime is not a problem though      
 alcohol and drugs are as they promote 
 vandalism.This crime is punished      
 either by a suspended sentence or     
 imprisonment.                         
    A few thefts take place at Botley  
 railway station, usually involving    
 stolen bicycles.                      
    Police often have to deal with the 
 traffic at Fairs and Fetes at places  
 like Fairthorne Manor.
