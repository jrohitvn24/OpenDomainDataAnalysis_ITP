		<title>13A DAY IN THE LIFE OF A PUPIL</title>
		<content>  I am a pupil at the Marlborough      
School however, I am going to tell you 
about a typical Saturday.              
  On Saturday, I get up early, scramble
into my clothes, have breakfast and    
rush off in the car to catch the bus   
for music school. We have an amusing   
journey picking up people with their   
bassoons, clarinets, trumpets, double  
basses etc. When we get there, we      
pluck and puff ourselves silly, and    
sing away till we are exhausted.       
  When I get home to my house in       
Kirtlington, I might go down to the    
lock or around the park for a walk. I  
do my homework varying, from English,  
History, Geography, Science or R.E. We 
then have tea and I watch my favourite 
film "Dynasty". Finally I go to bed.
