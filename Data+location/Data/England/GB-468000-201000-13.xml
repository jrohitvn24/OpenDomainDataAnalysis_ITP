		<title>13A visit to hospital</title>
		<content>I went into the John Radcliffe hospital
in Oxford. I went in to have the cyst  
under my tongue taken off. I had first 
noticed the cyst when I was cleaning my
teeth, it didn't really hurt unless I  
touched it. It looked like a big       
bubble. My hospital room had a bed, a  
bedside cupboard, a basin and a        
wardrobe. My mum stayed in the next    
room for the night. The next morning at
8.30 a.m. they put a funny cloak on me 
and took me to the operating theatre.  
They put a mask in front of my mouth,it
smelled like mint. When I woke up I was
back in my room. My tongue was sore and
hurt. There were four big stitches     
where the bubble used to be. Later on I
had bowl of tomato soup and a mousse.  
All the family came to collect me in   
the evening. When I got home I had some
more soup with some bread, some cereal 
and a tomato, I was very hungry!       </content>
