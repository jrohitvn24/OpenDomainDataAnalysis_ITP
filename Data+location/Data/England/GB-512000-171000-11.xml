		<title>11TEDDINGTON SWIMMING POOL</title>
		<content> A lot of children in this area use    
 Teddington Swimming Pool. It is also  
 used by local schools. It is a very   
 clean and tidy indoor pool, in fact   
 there are two pools, a big pool and a 
 learners pool. The staff are very     
 strict about who goes in the learners 
 pool and who goes in the deep end of  
 the big pool.There is no bombing,     
 pushing or summersaults allowed. There
 is a men's and a ladies' changing room
 with lockers. When you put ten pence  
 in the locker you can turn the key    
 (which has a band around it) to lock  
 the locker.You get the ten pence back 
 afterwards. The only thing I dont like
 about the pool is that the cafe is    
 very expensive.
