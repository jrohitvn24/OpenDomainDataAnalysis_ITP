		<title>18A Cleobury House</title>
		<content> I live at number four Curdale Close.  
 My house is made of brick. It is forty
 two years old. It was built during the
 second world war by the Ministry of   
 Supply for key workers at Muller's    
 Factory who came to Cleobury Mortimer 
 when their London factory was bombed  
 out at the beginning of the war,      
 during the Blitz.                     
 The houses have flat roofs which were 
 designed for people to watch for fires
 during the war. Our sitting room has  
 fourteen inch thick walls all around  
 it and was known as a shelter room.   
 Mum and dad's bedroom is also made the
 same way. Our house has two large     
 bedrooms and a smaller one where dad  
 keeps his model trains. Also upstairs 
 is a bathroom and a toilet. Downstairs
 we have a living room and a sitting   
 room, together with a kitchen and     
 outside verandah.                     </content>
