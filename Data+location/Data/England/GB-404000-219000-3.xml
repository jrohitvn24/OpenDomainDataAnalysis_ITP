		<title>03THE VILLAGE OF SALPERTON</title>
		<content> At one end of the village there is a  
 group of farm buildings including     
 several Cotswold stone barns and one  
 Dutch Barn,stacked with hay.Dry stone 
 walls line the lanes and divide one   
 property from another.There are two   
 splashes of red:one is the letter-box 
 and the other the single mellow red   
 brick wall of a house whose other     
 three walls are of cotswold           
 stone.Beside the letter-box is a      
 telephone kiosk and the nearby house  
 has the name 'THE OLD POST HOUSE' on  
 the gate .A stone carving of a bell   
 over another doorway ,with the words  
 'OLD BELL,1752' is another relic of   
 the past.Today there is neither post  
 office nor public house.              
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
