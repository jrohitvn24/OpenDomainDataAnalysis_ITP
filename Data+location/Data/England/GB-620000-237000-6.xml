		<content>  Chelmondiston is a small, compact    
village with a strong community spirit.
It has a Post Office, a butcher's, a   
gift shop, a grocer's, a bric-brac     
centre, and an art gallery. In         
Chelmondiston there are two pubs, the  
Forester's Arms and the Red Lion.      
Chelmondiston also has a Fish and Chip 
shop. There are three churches in the  
village, St. Andrew's C.of E., the     
Methodist Church and the Baptist       
Church. The oldest building is probably
the Red Lion, which is over 200 years  
old. Some houses in the village are    
quite old, but some have been built    
more recently. There are new bungalows 
planned for old people. There is a     
Primary School,a Toddler's group and a 
Play Group. There are clubs for adults 
and children. Most of the people who   
work locally are connected with        
businesses, boats and farming.         </content>
