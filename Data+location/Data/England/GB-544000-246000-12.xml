		<title>12Visiting a Farm</title>
		<content> All  Class 2 went to Whittlesford     
 farms. At one farm we saw the combine 
  and at another we saw some rare      
{sheep.}Every time we go to a farm it  
 is fun. The farm has{winter wheat,    
{spring wheat, sugar beet, barley}and  
 some{oats}which are grown for Quaker  
 porridge oats. (A firm that makes     
 cereals). These crops are called      
 arable which means that it is plant   
 life. There are hardly any animals.   
 The farm has some{oilseed rape.}When  
 it is flowering it is yellow. In some 
 patches it is more yellow because the 
 pigeons have stripped off the green   
 leaves. When it is harvested it is the
 colour of a hare's back. You can't    
 grow barley anymore because you can't 
 get any money out of it.              
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
