		<title>16     How To Play "BLOCK"</title>
		<content>  {Block}is an easy{game}when you get  
 used to it. The rules are these. One  
 person is on the 'block'-this may be a
 wall or a lamp post. This person must 
 close their eyes and count up to 500  
 in 5's. All the others go and hide.   
 When the person on the block has      
 finished counting, he searches for the
 others.                               
   The people who are hiding have to   
 run or creep to the block and touch   
 it. If the person who was counting    
 sees them and runs and touches the    
 block before them they are caught. The
 first person to be caught is on the   
 block for the next{game.}If all the   
 "Hiders" get to the block before the  
 person who was counting then he is on 
 the block again. The "Hiders" and the 
 person on the block shout{"BLOCK 1-2-3
{"}when they touch the block.
