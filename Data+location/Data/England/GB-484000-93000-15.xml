		<title>15CHURCHES IN SELSEY</title>
		<content>                                       
   Selsey is rich in churches. St.     
 Peter's church was built at Church    
 Norton in 681. In 1844 it was knocked 
 down, except for the chancel.   It was
 built again in 1866 in Selsey, with a 
 new chancel added. Both are now used  
 as places of worship. Selsey is one   
 parish with two parish churches. The  
 parish graveyard is still at Church   
 Norton.                               
   The Methodist Church was built in   
 1867, mainly of stones from the beach.
 Its pews came from a church in Croydon
 and the font from the former United   
 Reform Church in Chichester.          
   The Roman Catholic Church of St.    
 Wilfrid was built in 1961 and serves  
 a community of about 250 parishioners.
 The East Beach Evangelical Church is  
 only 8 years old with members from    
 many different denominations.         </content>
