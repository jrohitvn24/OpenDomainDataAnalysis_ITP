		<title>15Stilton Church</title>
		<content> One hot day we walked to Stilton.We   
 were going to see Stilton Church.     
 Stilton Church is different from      
 Folksworth Church in many ways.       
 Stilton Church has a high bell tower  
 and has three small windows above the 
 door at the rear of the church.Also   
 there are marble memorials of the two 
 world wars on the walls and floor at  
 Stilton Church.The pulpits are both   
 different.The Folksworth pulpit has   
 got spiral stairs leading up to it.   
 The reverend takes services at Stilton
 Church and Folksworth Church.         
 At the church we did sme sketches and 
 we did some rubbings.It was a long    
 walk to Stilton,it took about         
 thirty-five minutes.When we got back  
 to school most of us were very very   
 tired.                                
                                       
                                       </content>
