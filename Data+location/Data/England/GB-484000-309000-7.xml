		<title>07A POLICEMAN'S DAY IN OAKHAM</title>
		<content>       Oakham's police station is      
 situated on Station Road and has a    
 contingent of 41 officers. The old    
 county of Rutland is the area         
 patrolled by the station, which is    
 part of the Leicestershire            
 Constabulary. This is mainly a rural  
 district.                             
       The day is divided into three   
 main shifts; 6am-2pm, 2pm-10pm,       
 10pm_6am. On each shift there are at  
 least 4 officers: one patrolling      
 Oakham on foot, one in an area car    
 patrolling Rutland and another patrols
 locally in a car. While the sargeant  
 in charge of the shift stays at the   
 station.                              
       Crime presents very few problems
 in Oakham, the main problem area being
 the traffic on the A1 and A47 with    
 accidents, particulary in the holiday 
 period.                               </content>
