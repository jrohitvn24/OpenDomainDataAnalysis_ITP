 being reorganised and will reopen on  
 Easter Sunday,1986.St. Martins hall,  
 situated behind the church, is used by
 the church and local community. The

 talks, socials etc.  Each Christmas   
 they  visit the Bourne First School,  
 where they are entertained by the     
 children and served with tea.
