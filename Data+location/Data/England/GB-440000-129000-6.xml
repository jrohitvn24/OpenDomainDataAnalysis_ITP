		<content>  I get up at 7.30 and have egg on     
 toast.I walk to school at 8.15 and    
 play on the playground.The bell goes  
 at 8.45 and we line up to go into     
 class.First we read silently for 20   
 minutes.Then we do maths.Next we have 
 assembly for the whole school (there  
 are 64 pupils) where we hear a story  
 and sing two hymns.                   
  After that we have a short playtime  
 and then do writing until lunchtime.We
 eat lunch in the staffroom because our
 new hall isn't finished.Most children 
 have sandwiches.After a longer play we
 do some work on our project about wind
 and energy.Then we have music followed
 by a game of longball.When the bell   
 goes I go home,watch television and   
 have my tea.I go to bed about 9.00p.m.
