		<content>    In our spare time most children    
 watch T.V. and ride bikes.Sometimes   
 people read books and newspapers.Our  
 latest thing is probably 'Stinkky     
 Stickers'.Stinky Stickers are things  
 that you scratch and then smell.Some  
 people go out into the woods and take 
 their dogs for a walk or build        
 camps.On Tuesday boys have Cubs,then  
 on Thursdays girls have Brownies.Quite
 a few people do gardening.Some people 
 do sports as well like cricket,tennis,
 football,horse-riding and net-ball.A  
 lot of people go jogging in the woods,
 not just to keep fit but to enjoy the 
 veiws.A large number of people play   
 golf and go swimming at Dear Leap.But 
 Dear Leap is an open air swimming pool
 so in the winter you would have to go 
 to Tring or to Hemel Hempsted.There   
 are two Youth Clubs, one attached to  
 the local Church.                     </content>
