		<content>{The Jubilee club}is for the old people
 in the village. The village had a fete
 for the Queen's siver jubilee with    
 sports and a picnic. The old people   
 went to the pantomime and then formed 
 their own club. The Jubilee hall also 
 started from the Queen's siver        
 jubilee. The money that was left      
 started the fund to provide toilets   
 and changing facilities.{The hall was 
{officially opened in 1984.            
 The activities in Childs Ercall       
 every year are_ Childs Ercall fete,   
 gymkhana and the horticultural show.  
{The mothers  union}is specially       
 concerned with all that strengthens   
 and preserves marriage and christian  
 family life. We meet once a month     
 usualy in the vicarage, first we have 
 a service, the vicar's wife leading,  
 then a talk of some_thing, maybe the  
 work of mothers union overseas        </content>
