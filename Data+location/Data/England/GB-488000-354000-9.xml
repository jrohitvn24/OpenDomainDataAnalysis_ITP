		<content>     Some local people were            
 interviewed about life in the past:   
    "We didn't have a bathroom at all. 
 We just kept a tin bath on the wall,so
 we had to fetch it in every time we   
 wanted a bath.Then we would fill it   
 using buckets of water from the       
 copper.There were no electric irons.  
 We had to heat one up in front of the 
 fire.The toilet was at the bottom of  
 the garden.We had to make our own     
 entertainment.We played whip and tops 
 down the street.A gang of us would    
 start at Stragglethorpe and see who   
 could keep it going all the way to    
 Brant Broughton.We would sing songs   
 around the piano at night.            
    When war broke out we had to dig   
 our own air raid shelter at the bottom
 of the garden, and when the gas masks 
 were given out people weren't very    
 keen on them at all."                 </content>
