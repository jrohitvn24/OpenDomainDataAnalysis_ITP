		<title>11THE PRINTING TRADE</title>
		<content> "THE PRESS"                           
 The main employer in this area is "The
 Press"                                
 The Anchor Press decided to enlarge in
 the 1960's as did The Hutchinson      
 Group.Hutchinsons decided to          
 centralise its book printing,binding  
 and distribution on one site in       
 Tiptree.The new bindery is capable of 
 producing 380,000 books a week.New    
 machinery installed in 1965           
 incorporated offset litho             
 machines.Because of the vast number of
 books printed it was decided to build 
 a new warehouse for book              
 distribution.This is called Tiptree   
 Book Services Limited.                
 Tiptree is the only place in Europe   
 where a manuscript can be received,   
 composed,printed,bound,warehoused     
 and distributed to the trade from one 
 site.                                 </content>
