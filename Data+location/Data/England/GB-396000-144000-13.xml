		<content> The only relic of the old church of   
 All Saint's is part of the graveyard, 
 now largely surrounded by farm        
 buildings, some old, some new, and the
 large 17th Century stone house of     
 Manor Farm. The 19th Century flint and
 stone church of All Saint's has been  
 built on a new site. There are several
 quite large old houses in this        
 northern part of the village; one     
 having been built in the 17th Century 
 as a hunting lodge, and one which was 
 an old 16th Century Priory and        
 includes St.Andrew's Chapel with a    
 stone arched gateway into the         
 courtyard. Many of the houses are     
 built of stone and flint but often    
 include brick and/or plaster          
 facings.Apart from Manor Farm there is
 another substantial stone and brick   
 farmhouse and an old closed square    
 range of loose boxes for racehorses.  </content>
