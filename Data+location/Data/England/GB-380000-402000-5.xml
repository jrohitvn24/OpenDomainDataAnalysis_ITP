		<title>05HEATON PARK - HISTORY</title>
		<content>{Heaton Hall}was built in the grounds  
 for Lord and Lady Wilton in 1745.In   
 1860 Lord Wilton tried to sell Heaton 
 Hall.If this had happened it would    
 have divided Heaton Park in two.The   
 estste had 652 acres and 21 roads.    
                                       
 In 1860 the part of the park opposite 
 St Peters R.C. School was a racecourse
 and it was a{barracks for the RAF and 
{Army}before the World War II          
                                       
 Some prefabs were built in 1943 and   
 pulled down in 1965.They were pulled  
 down because the deeds of the park did
 not allow any buildings.Shop owners in
 the area protested because of the loss
 of customers.
