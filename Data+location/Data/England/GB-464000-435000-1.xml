		<title>01A Summary of Our Area</title>
		<content>Our Domesday Block is located          
north-east of Selby, North Yorkshire,  
between Barlby and North Duffield. No  
village lies within its boundaries,    
only scattered farms and a few houses  
along the main road, the A163. The most
distinctive features of the area are   
its arable farming land and Skipwith   
Common, an area of heath, woodland and 
marsh. The Common is best known for its
Nature Reserve, managed by the         
Yorkshire Wildlife Trust. The recently 
built Whitemoor Mine is part of the    
Selby Coalfield. Riccall mine barely   
brushes the western fringe of the area.
Despite the new mine, the area's       
character remains rural. There are     
several pig and poultry farms. The     
place of most historical interest is   
Danes' Hill, an ancient burial mound.
