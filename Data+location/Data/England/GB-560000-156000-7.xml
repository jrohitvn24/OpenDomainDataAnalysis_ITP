		<content>   A lot of adults spend a good part of
their leisure time either taking part  
in or watching sport.                  
   We found that swimming and tennis   
are the most popular sports that people
in Platt participate in. Next came     
badminton for adults and horse riding  
fo children.                           
   Most adults spent one to three hours
a week doing sport, although many spent
between four and seven hours a week.   
Most sport played by adults was played 
outside Platt because of the lack of   
sporting facilities within it. There is
for example no football ground,        
swimming pool or sports centre.        
   People who watch sport mostly watch 
it on television although some people  
do go and watch sport "live". e.g. they
watch live football, cricket, horse    
riding and tennis.
