		<title>10POLLARD'S MONSTER - 2</title>
		<content> Lord Mitford, passing on his way to   
 London and hearing of the reward took 
 the beast's head from Pollard while he
 slept.  When Pollard awoke he hastened
 to the Bishop's Palace.  The Bishop   
 was dining and not wishing to be      
 disturbed sent word that for his      
 reward he might ride around while the 
 Bishop dined.  Pollard at once rode   
 round Auckland Castle and claimed the 
 castle and its contents.  To redeem   
 the castle the Bishop agreed to grant 
 Pollard the freehold estate, still    
 known by his name.                    
    Meanwhile Lord Mitford arrived in  
 London and received the King's award. 
 Althugh Pollard follwed and produced  
 the creature's tongue to support his  
 claim, he was ignored but retained his
 land.  Tenure is mentioned as early as
 1402.  Pollard's family became extinct
 in the reign of Elizabeth I.          </content>
