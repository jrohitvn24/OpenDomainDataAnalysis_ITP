		<title>20Our 1985 DOMESDAY survey</title>
		<content> This is a{summary}of the block we have
 surveyed for the Domesday Project. The
 SW part bordering Exmouth town centre 
 is mostly small shops; several streets
 of Victorian terraced houses some of  
 which are known as "The Colony";and   
 the main Exeter Road into town. The   
 town has expanded steadily since the  
 last war and the rest of our block is 
 mixed housing ranging from large,     
 older houses along Exeter and Hulham  
 Roads to the growing estates in the   
 Brixington area.Our block includes    
 some farmland to the N and E but this 
 is gradually being bought for and     
 there is a controversial plan to build
 a larger industrial estate to the N   
 and to complete the ring-road (Dinan  
 Way).  Our thanks go to the many      
 parents of children at both schools   
 and students at Rolle College who     
 helped us to complete our Survey.     </content>
