		<title>17THE SEA SHORE</title>
		<content> When we got down to the beach we saw  
 many interesting shells.We saw a      
 couple of jelly fish and one star     
 fish.We found a rock with funny       
 markings on it and a piece of flint.  
 There were two different sorts of     
 crabs and a water flea we think.On the
 beach there was lots of platomore and 
 rocks.Seaweed was dotted about on the 
 sand and the rocks.We also saw the    
 pillboxes which were left from the    
 war.There were big pools of water and 
 under a piece of rock there were two  
 crabs.
