		<title>04THE WASTE PAPER FACTORY</title>
		<content>    There is a waste paper factory in  
 Baltonsborough. It started in 1951    
 with an output of 10 tonnes per week. 
 Now the output is 200 tonnes which    
 saves 3,400 trees a week.The area of  
 the factory is 1.5 acres. Waste paper 
 comes from all over the West Country. 
 It comes mainly from banks, businesses
 and computers.The waste is mainly     
 clean or printed and is sorted into   
 different compartments and then baled.
 A  bale weighs half a tonne. Twenty   
 tonnes are loaded onto a lorry. There 
 is about Â£40 profit for 1 tonne of top
 quality paper.The price varies on     
 quality from Â£45_Â£250.The factory     
 handles approximately 40 out of 100   
 different grades of paper. 17 workers 
 are employed. Villagers complain about
 the state of the roads left by heavy  
 lorries, but these are not all from   
 waste paper lorries.                  </content>
