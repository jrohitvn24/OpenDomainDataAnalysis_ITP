		<title>09ARGUMENTS AGAINST THE MINE</title>
		<content>We are against having a coal mine near 
Kenilworth because it will destroy the 
countryside in that area and destroy   
the homes of many animals.It will also 
ruin crops and farms etc.We do not like
the idea of being a mining town and    
joining Coventry because our crime rate
will increase.If there was a strike,we 
would be affected.Also,trucks carrying 
coal would be running through town and 
it would polute the air.Also it would  
ruin the roads.People might want to    
move out. It would also spoil the      
historic part of Kenilworth. The       
miners' sons might be punks and they   
would probably vandalise the town like 
smashing windows, spraying paint all   
over people's houses etc. People who   
live near the coalmine might be able to
hear the buzzing and noise of lorries.
