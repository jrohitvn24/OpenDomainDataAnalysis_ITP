		<content> This information was collected and put
 together by 8-9 year old children of  
 Northwood County Primary School with  
 the help of parents and teachers in   
 the Summer Term of 1985.They were     
 assisted by the 1st Northwood Cub     
 Scouts.                               
 It has proved to be an interesting and
 valuable study of the area and much   
 has been learnt in the way of         
 map-reading and the use of the        
 micro-processor. This project method  
 of learning is widely used in schools 
 at this time.
