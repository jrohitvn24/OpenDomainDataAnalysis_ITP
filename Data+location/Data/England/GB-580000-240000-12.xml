		<content>{Home life                             
{  }Being a very rural area family life
 tends to be more complete,            
 responsibilities to the family are    
 taken seriously so few problems with  
 homeless youngers and elderly people -
 they are helped to live in the        
 community either by their families    
 and/or by good neighbours-many people 
 cook meals etc. for elderly neighbours
 and generally help to take care of    
 them.                                 
     One parent families also get lots 
 of help from neighbours etc.          
     Household safety generally good.  
     Many people have pets-dogs, cats, 
 rabbits, ferrets, budgies etc.        
     Many people grow their own food,  
 and preserve food some aiming for self
 sufficiency.
