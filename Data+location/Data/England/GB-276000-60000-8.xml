		<content>  Our square's one in a part of Devon  
 called the South Hams. The landscape  
 is very hilly, there is hardly any    
 flat ground here.We don't have any    
 stone walls surounding the fields,    
 instead we have hedges and trees.     
 There are many green lanes such as    
 Coplands and Jackmans lanes where     
 there are Devon banks, which are small
 walls covered with earth and with     
 hedgerows on top and wild flowers all 
 the way up.They are often  5 or 6     
 metres high.There are large areas of  
 woodland, some  coniferous and some of
 mixed trees.It is an area of          
 countryside containing many farms.
