		<content> One of the people who enjoys the peace
 and isolation of an old Cotswold      
 farmhouse is author Tim Fitzgeorge    
 Parker. With 17 books to his credit he
 is a writer well-known in equestrian  
 circles. In his time he has trained   
 horses at Lambourn and ridden         
 steeplechasers. He was for 12 years   
 chief racing correspondent of the     
 Daily Mail. He is often called upon to
 write obituaries of famous            
 personalities. He chose his home      
 because of its position, being central
 to the race-courses and stud farms of 
 England. He runs a firm publicising   
 bloodstock and stud farms.            
 As a young man he joined the Royal    
 Scots Greys and won the Military Cross
 at the battle of Salerno.             
 Major Fitzgeorge-Parker is married    
 with two children.
