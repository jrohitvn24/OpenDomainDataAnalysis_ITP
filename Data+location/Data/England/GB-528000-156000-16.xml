		<title>16The Village of Hooley,Surrey</title>
		<content>  Hooley is a quiet dormitory village  
whose peace is only disturbed by the   
high density of vehicular traffic on   
the main A23 London to Brighton road   
and the mainline railway which also    
carries the Gatwick Express from London
Victoria.                              
  Its population is about two thousand 
of whom a third are now retired people 
and about a tenth are unemployed. Most 
of the remainder who work are employed 
in London. Around the village, market  
gardening crops are grown which are on 
offer for sale alongside the A23. A few
people are employed in the shops, cafes
and restaurants on the main road too.  
 Most everyday needs are provided for  
in the parade of shops along Brighton  
Road which includes a supermarket and a
a post office. A petrol filling station
is conveniently situated next door.
