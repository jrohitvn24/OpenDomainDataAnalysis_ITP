		<title>09Auckley Guides</title>
		<content> Guides meet in the church hall each   
 Wednesday from 7.15pm-9.00pm.We play  
 all different games &amp; we have patrols.
 These consist of 6 people,a leader,&amp; a
 seconder.We have 6 patrols,all named  
 after flowers.We have many trips  &amp;   
 each year go to camp. It costs 30p    
 each week. We go on marches through   
 Doncaster &amp; go to church services.    
    The uniform is a blue skirt,hat    
 &amp; blouse.A belt, &amp; an orange          
 neckerchief.                          
    You start guides when are 10 &amp; you 
 leave at 15.We do lots of different   
 badges,such as first aid.Some of the  
 badges have to be renewed annually.We 
 also learn about different kinds of   
 knots as well.                        
    I like guides &amp; I recomend Auckley 
 guides as they have over 40 members.It
 is the biggest company in the         
 district.                             </content>
