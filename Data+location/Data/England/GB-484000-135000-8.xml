		<content>      In July 1985 families live in    
                                       
 many different ways.  This is just    
 about mine.                           
      We live in{West Surrey}where     
 there is not too much unemployment.  I
 work as a{teacher}in a primary school 
 about three miles away and drive the  
 car to get there.  My wife works as a 
{secretary}in a forestry company and   
 bicycles about a mile and a half to   
 her office.                           
      We have{three children. }The     
 elder girl is married and works in an 
{insurance}company's offices, her      
 husband works behind the counter in   
 the{Post Office.} Our son works in    
{Saudi Arabia}and does six weeks there 
 then has three weeks holiday at home. 
 Our youngest daughter is at an        
{Institute of Higher Education}studying
 for a B.A. degree.                    </content>
