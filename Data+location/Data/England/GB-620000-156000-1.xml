		<content> Littlebourne area includes the        
  villages of Ickham Littlebourne,     
 Wickhambreux thus comprising 3        
 communities each separate with its own
 Parish Council, Church,Village Hall.  
 Littlebourne has its own vicar whilst 
 Wickhambreux + Ickham share one with  
 Stodmarsh. Shortly all four will join.
 Ickham has no school. A unifying      
 element is the Little Stour River     
 which rises in the chalk and runs     
 through all three parishes often      
 forming the boundary between. It is   
 also fed by the Nailbourne an         
 intermittent stream. Bramling and     
 Wingham Well are small hamlets looking
 to Ickham + Wingham as their centres. 
 The whole area is mixed agricultural  
 land of high quality growing a whole  
 diversity of crops. There are water   
 meadows by the river, patches of      
 woodland + many well used footpaths.  </content>
