		<title>20Aid for starving Ethiopians</title>
		<content>In 1984 we heard the tragic news of the
starving people of Ethiopia. Our class 
raised money to help them by having a  
"Wear your own clothes day" when we    
paid 10p for each piece of clothing    
that was not school uniform.Then we    
made cakes and biscuits to sell and we 
raffled a huge teddy bear. A lot of us 
bought a record made by pop star Bob   
Geldorf who formed a group called Band-
Aid. It was made up of pop groups such 
as Wham, Spandau Ballet, U2 and many   
others.The song was about the famine   
and it explained how many people starve
and how lucky we are. So many records  
were sold that the record shot to No.1 
in the Pop Charts. It made thousands of
pounds to help Ethiopia. It was a good 
record and it made young people feel   
very sad about starving people and made
them want to help as much as they      
could.                                 </content>
