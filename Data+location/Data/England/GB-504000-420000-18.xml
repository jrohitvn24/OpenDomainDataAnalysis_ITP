		<title>18THE SCHOOL VISIT</title>
		<content> Yesterday our class went on a trip to 
 Hornsea Pottery.We went first to the  
 World of Wings where they have lots of
 birds of prey consisting mainly of    
 owls and falcons.The warden told us   
 about each bird in turn.Quite a few of
 the birds had been given to the RSPCA 
 by people who took them from the woods
 as babies thinking it was a good      
 thing.They then couldn't look after   
 them and handed them in.Mr Smith then 
 untied a Lanner Falcon from its       
 perch,and started swinging a lure.The 
 falcon caught the lure after several  
 attempts.After that we went to        
 Butterfly world where there are five  
 hundred different species of butter   
 flies.After walking around the model  
 village,we went for lunch.For lunch we
 had beefburger,chips and beans and    
 fruit salad.                          
                                       </content>
