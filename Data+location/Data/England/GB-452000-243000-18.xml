		<title>18A vegetarian's diet.</title>
		<content>Mr Metcalfe told me he does not eat    
meat since he read a book called Animal
Liberation.He disliked the way that    
animals were killed just for us to eat.
That was six years ago and he feels his
health has improved.Sometimes he eats  
fish.                                  
He is a teacher and on a typical       
working day he eats Muesli (oats,nuts, 
dried fruit and bran) for breakfast,   
followed by brown bread and marmalade  
but no butter.For lunch he has a cheese
or salad sandwich made with brown      
bread.For supper,the night I visited   
him,he ate a cutlet made with nuts and 
sesame seeds,bread and an egg,with new 
potatoes and vegatables grown in his   
own garden.For pudding he had a slice  
of home-made fruit cake.
