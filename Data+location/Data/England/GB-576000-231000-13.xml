		<title>13OLD HOUSES IN S. HEDINGHAM</title>
		<content>   {Mrs.Weatherly's house}was built    
 in 1750. It has wooden beams and the  
 walls are mostly made of wattle and   
 daub but parts are Tudor brick. The   
 floors upstairs are oak. The roof is  
 covered with peg tiles.               
    In the{house}they have a huge      
 fireplace which used to be bricked up 
 but now the men have knocked it out   
 and it is bigger. There is a salt dry 
 to keep the salt in.                  
    The{house}used to have a shop at   
 the front. It used to sell hats and   
 then it became a general store. It was
 built on to the{house}in 1890 and it  
 closed in 1977. Mrs.Weatherly has     
 found many old coins,the earliest was 
 dated  1775.                          
    Outside their{house}there is a well
 that is about 40 feet deep,which has a
 board across the middle to stop you   
 falling down.                         </content>
