		<title>05FARMS AROUND HIGHAM FERRERS</title>
		<content>The land to the east of Higham Ferrers 
is mostly used for farming. Farms have 
changed a lot since the first Domesday 
Book. Nowadays farmers have lots of    
machinery that is essential to a modern
farm, enabling the land to be          
intensively farmed by very few people  
e.g. 1 farmer can cover 160 acres.     
                                       
In Autunm the farmers need a drill and 
in Summer a combine harvester. After   
harvest the stubble is burnt sending   
black ashes flying through the air     
making driving difficult and clean     
washing dirty.                         
                                       
Crops (e.g. wheat) have been troubled  
with pests, especially Aphids. Alot of 
farmers keep animals as well as growing
crops. Cows are the most popular, then 
sheep. Not many farmers keep pigs      
because they are not always healthy.   </content>
