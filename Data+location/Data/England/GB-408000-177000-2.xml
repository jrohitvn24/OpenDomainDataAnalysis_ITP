		<title>02THE WHITE HORSE OF BROADTOWN</title>
		<content> The{White Horse}of{BroadTown}was cut  
 in about{1864}by{Mr William Simmonds  
 of{Littleton (LittleTown)}farm on the 
 hills above{BroadTown}almost opposite 
 the school.It measured eighty six feet
 in length by sixty one in height.Today
 it measures 24m long by 19.06m high.  
 When scoured it used to be visible up 
 to twenty miles away.By{1936}the horse
 was in a really bad state and         
 the lower part of the legs had been   
 lost.It is shown in a{trotting        
{posistion.}Now the horse has no{chalk 
 left on it and it has almost          
 disappeared.About two years ago some  
 of the villagers including children   
 helped to tidy it up.It still remains 
 but never white.
