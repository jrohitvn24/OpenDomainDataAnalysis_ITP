		<content> The Young Wives Club was formed in    
 March l975 as a way of getting mum's  
 with babies and tots together.  We    
 meet once a month at a members        
 house.We start with coffee and        
 biscuits and a chat, this is followed 
 by a talk or demonstration.  We have  
 visited a pottery, cheese dairy and   
 cider maker.  Our December meeting is 
 decorating the Christmas tree in      
 Church followed by Mince Pies and Hot 
 Punch.                                
 Long Sutton Football Club started in  
 l966.  There are about 45 people      
 involed with the club.  There are 3   
 teams.  They wear a Black and Blue    
 strip or a Red and Black. The         
 Manager's wife washes all the kit.    
 There are about 2O to 3O supporters   
 for Long Sutton.  The supporters are  
 nice and cheer for Long Sutton, who   
 have won 3O cups in 2O years.         </content>
