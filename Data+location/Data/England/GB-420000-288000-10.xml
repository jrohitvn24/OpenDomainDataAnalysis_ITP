 Sacred Heart and St.Theresa in        
 Coleshill is very special because its 
 the only church to be built during the
 second world war in Europe.It replaced
 the church which is now the church    
 hall.The Catholic school,St.Edwards   
  has 99 pupils in 1985.Nuns have had a
 convent in Coleshillfor over a hundred
 years.Father Hudson bought a large    
 piece of land to build homes and      
 school for orphans from all over the  
 Midlands,and{St.Gerards hospital}for  
 handicapped chidren.The Sisters of    
 Charity of St.Paul came to teach,nurse
 and look after the children.There were
 five homes St.Edwards,St.George,St    
 Paul,St.Catherine and St.Joans.St.    
 Joans is the only one open today for  
 children,the remainder are being
