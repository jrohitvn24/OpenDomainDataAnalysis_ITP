		<title>02The Railway Embankment.</title>
		<content>  The extreme south west corner of the 
 segment is crossed by a disused       
 railway embankment. The railway used  
 to run from Hull to Barnsley and      
 passed through many small villages and
 towns. The railway was closed in the  
 !960's. The segment also touches the  
 corner of Hessle Golf Club. The north 
 end of the Humber Bridge was built on 
 part of the original course and the   
 new one was opened here at Raywell,   
 six miles away, in 1975.              
                                       
  The land to the north of the golf    
 course is arable farming land.
