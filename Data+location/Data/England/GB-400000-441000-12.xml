		<title>12REDCAR TARN cont.</title>
		<content>   Nowadays,the tarn is used for a     
 variety of recreational activities.In 
 Summer it is very busy at the weekends
 as children are able to paddle,swim or
 take dinghies into the water.Fishing  
 is another popular pastime all year   
 round and model speedboat races are   
 held once or twice a year.An annual   
 raft race is held on the tarn,when    
 opposing teams,starting from either   
 end of the tarn try to push each other
 into the water!                       
   In Winter,when the tarn freezes     
 over,it is ideal for ice-skating.The  
 conversion of Redcar Tarn from a boggy
 swamp to a lake was,in fact due to the
 work of Keighley Skating Club         
 established in 1865.Founder members   
 included a future Mayor and M.P. for  
 Keighley,members of the Brigg family.
