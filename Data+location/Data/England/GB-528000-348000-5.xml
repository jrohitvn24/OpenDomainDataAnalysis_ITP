		<content>        Most of the houses in this area
 are made of bricks. There are houses  
 being built in the village. Some      
 houses are older and you can tell that
 by the state of the bricks ,they are  
 a different colour and they are a bit 
 more crumbly.There are no houses or   
 other buildings that are more than two
 hundred years old because before that 
 time this area was uninhabited fen    
 land.                                 
      There has been a lot of building 
 in recent years.A new estate,         
 Castlegate is being built off Leagate 
  road .Now most of the houses in the  
 village are new ones.There are about 7
 plots waiting to be built on still in 
 the centre of the village.Most of the 
 houses are owner occupied by people   
 who have no connection with farming.
