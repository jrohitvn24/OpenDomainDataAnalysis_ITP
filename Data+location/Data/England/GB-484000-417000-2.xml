		<title>02The Church of St. Andrew</title>
		<content> St. Andrew's Church is an attractive  
 limestone building set on a raised    
 site and so is a striking feature of  
 the landscape.The churchyard contains 
 several mature yew trees and is       
 approached through a beautiful        
 lichgate.To the west the ground falls 
 away down the cliff and there are     
 views to the Trent Valley over the    
 trees standing in the road leading    
 down to the Stather.The church has    
 been restored at various times but the
 tower and the south doorway are the   
 original as built 750 years ago.Over a
 Norman pillar of the north arcade is  
 carved a figure of a monk holding an  
 inverted skull.There is an early 14th 
 century effigy of a knight and the    
 chancel contains various monuments to 
 the Sheffield family of Normanby.
