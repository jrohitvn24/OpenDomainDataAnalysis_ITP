		<content>   TRANSPORT OF SOME KIND IS ESSENTIAL 
 FOR THE PEOPLE OF SHROTON AS THERE ARE
 ONLY TWO VERY SMALL SHOPS WHICH STOCK 
 ONLY ESSENTIAL THINGS.                
  THERE IS A REGULAR{BUS}SERVICE EVERY 
 TWO HOURS GOING TO SHAFTESBURY OR     
 BLANDFORD, THE TWO NEIGHBOURING TOWNS 
 WHICH ARE ABOUT SEVEN MILES EACH WAY  
 FROM SHROTON. THIS BUS SERVICE IS USED
 ALSO FOR TAKING CHILDREN TO THE       
 SECONDARY SCHOOL IN SHAFTESBURY AND   
 THE PRIMARY SCHOOL IN FONTMELL MAGNA. 
  MOST OF THE SHROTON RESIDENTS HAVE AT
 LEAST ONE OR MORE{CARS.}THESE CARS ARE
 USED FOR TRAVELLING TO WORK AND FOR   
 DRIVING TO TOWNS TO GET SHOPPING. VERY
 FEW PEOPLE USE A BICYCLE OR MOTORCYCLE
 AS THEIR MAIN FORM OF TRANSPORT.      
  THERE IS A{RAILWAY}STATION ABOUT 12  
 MILES AWAY ON THE WATERLOO-EXETER LINE
 WHICH IS USEFUL FOR PEOPLE WANTING TO 
 COMMUTE OR GO SHOPPING IN BIGGER TOWNS</content>
