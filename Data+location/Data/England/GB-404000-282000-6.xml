		<content>  Within the area,houses vary          
 considerably in size &amp; style.Moreover 
 they can be divided into 3 general    
 categories.The 1st is of very small   
 terraced houses with little or no     
 garden,most of which were built during
 the{Victorian}period.The 2nd has small
 gardens but fairly large houses;most  
 of these houses being built fairly    
 recently (post-war).The 3rd have large
 gardens &amp; houses;these were built over
 a wide time span,but nearly all of    
 them are pre-war.The most notable area
 of the 1st category is{Selly Oak},with
 high density,poor quality housing.The 
{Envelope scheme},started in1982,hopes 
 to refurbish this area &amp; preserve the 
 traditional community,without changing
 it as drastically as a comprehensive  
 redevelopment scheme would do{.Balsall
{Heath}is the only other area with a   
 large amount of the 1st category./cont</content>
