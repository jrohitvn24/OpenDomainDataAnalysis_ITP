		<content>    The situation of block 04520087 is 
 3km S.W. of Ryde and 2.5km E. of      
 Newport.  It is a rural area on chalk 
 downland which rises to 135m and      
 includes the scarp face to the South. 
 The land slopes gently away to the    
 North on clay of the Hamstead beds:   
 here it is well wooded.  Narrow brooks
 start from a spring line along the    
 northern edge of the chalk downs      
 and flow northwards to the Solent.    
    Isolated farms dominate the area   
 along with one small Manor House,     
 Great East Standen, which was         
 mentioned in the 1086 Domesday Book as
 Standone. The county's chief rubbish  
 dump is at Lynnbottom Copse.  Roads   
 skirt the downs, but numerous         
 footpaths and tracks cross the downs. 
 Main attractions in the D block are:  
 1) Havenstreet Railway Centre.        
 2) Robin Hill Country Park.           </content>
