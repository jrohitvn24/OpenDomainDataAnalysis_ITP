		<content>  The name Peacehaven was given to a   
development of houses in this area     
after the Great War.                   
  The name was chosen as a result of a 
competition for a suitable home.       
 The original development was along a  
coastal strip and later extended out   
towards Telscombe Village. The         
constant pressure for housing has led  
to more new housing estates to the     
north.                                 
  During May/July 1985 the rate at     
which houses were being completed      
meant no figure could be agreed at for 
the number of houses in the area.      
  Access to the area is by roads       
leading to the main south coast road   
although many residents work in Lewes  
to the north. This places pressure on  
the unofficial cross-country routes    
which run over private land or land    
under conservation orders.             </content>
