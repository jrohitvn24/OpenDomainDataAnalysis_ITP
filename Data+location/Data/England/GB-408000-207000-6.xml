		<title>06FISHING IN THE COLN RIVER</title>
		<content> The Coln is a typical chalk stream and
 the fishing is almost entirely dry fly
 for trout, though there are some      
 grayling in the river. In the past    
 brown trout bred there, but to-day the
 river is largely stocked with fish    
 which have been bred elsewhere. The   
 fishing rights throughout are         
 privately owned and permission from   
 the respective owners is required to  
 fish.The rights to the stretch which  
 divides Bibury from Arlington are held
 by the Swan Hotel. Most of the trout  
 are brown trout, but close above and  
 below the hatchery at Bibury there is 
 a preponderance of rainbow trout in   
 the river. The season is from 1.April 
 to 30.September, and there is usually 
 a good hatch of mayfly between the    
 last ten days in May and mid-June.
