		<title>12Annual Events, Evesham.</title>
		<content>    Every year lots of{events}go on in 
 Evesham.There are things like the{fun 
{run}when lots of people come every    
 year to run around the town centre.   
 Some wear fancy-dress. Another thing  
 is the{Cropthorne Walkabout}when lots 
 of people walk around looking at the  
 villagers' gardens and having teas,   
 listening to bands and watching Morris
 Dancers. The things that I like best  
 are the{Hampton pancake race}and the  
 Mop.{The Mop}is the fair on Evesham's 
 Crown Meadow. It began many years ago 
 when farm workers hired themselves out
 for a year's work and there were a few
 sideshows. The other thing that I like
 is the big{November 5th bonfire}on the
 Crown Meadow. The{Evesham Horticult-  
{ural Show}is very good as well.
