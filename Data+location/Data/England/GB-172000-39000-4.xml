		<title>04ST DAY FEAST.</title>
		<content> On St Day Feast Day I went to school  
 in the morning and did normal lessons.
 In the afternoon I changed into my    
 best dress ready for the dance. At 2  
 o'clock we lined up in the playground 
 and found our partners. Then we       
 marched through the gate and through  
 the village to Mills Street and there 
 we stopped while the band played "The 
 Lord's my Shepherd" and another hymn. 
 When we got to the playing-field we   
 put our flowers on the Mills memorial.
 We got ready for the dance and we     
 found our partners again.When we did  
 start to dance it started to pour down
 with rain. After that we had a{Safron 
{Bun,}a bottle of pop and 50p.Then it  
 was time for the races.When we got    
 home Mummy said we must have been     
 doing the rain dance instead of the   
 Feast Dance.
