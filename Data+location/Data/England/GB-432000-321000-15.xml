{ }About ten years ago the{Severn Trent
{Water Board}bought some land to be    
 made into a reservoir. The water that 
 is put into the reservoir is pumped up
 from the{River Dove}which is further  
 down the valley. It is only used in   
 the middle of summer when there is not
 much water about. The water goes to   
 homes in{Leicestershire.}People are   
 not supposed to swim in the reservoir.
                                       
   When they had built it, the Water   
 Board gave an area of land and water  
 to the{Derbyshire Naturalists' Trust, 
 who made it into a nature reserve.    
 Here animals can live peacefuly and   
 humans can go for walks and enjoy the 
 beautiful place they live near. Boats 
 are not allowed in that area of water 
 because they might disturb the        
 wildlife.                             </content>
