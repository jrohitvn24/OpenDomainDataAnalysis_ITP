		<content> CHERYL PARKER looks at the changes in 
 Bishops Stortford, 1910 - 1985.       
 In my colour picture of 1910, the     
 Causeway is just mud and so is the    
 pathway. Tall trees grow over the     
 road; the river flows untamed and     
 over-grown,a brick bridge leads to the
 castle ruins. There is no traffic; all
 is peaceful. A girl in black          
 stockings, a pale blue pinafore and a 
 straw hat stops to chat to an old man 
 in rag-like clothes.                  
 Seventy five years later all is       
 changed. Hoards of vehicles roar down 
 the road, hundreds of people hurry by 
 in normal and outrageous clothes. The 
 river is tamed, the trees are cleared 
 away. The bridge is graffiti-sprayed  
 concrete. Everyone is rushed and      
 everything is noisy.
