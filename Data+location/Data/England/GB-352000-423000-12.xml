The housing is very mixed in the       
Farington area. There is a large modern
estate to the west of the area built in
the l960s. It consists of 2 or 3       
bedroomed semidetached house and       
bungalows predominately privately      
owned. A similar development has been  
built to the east just off the Croston 
Road.                                  
                                       
The rest of the housing is, on the     
whole, built along the two major roads 
being either prewar semi and detached  
houses or Victorian terraced. These    
terraced houses have been modernised   
under government grant schemes         
providing bathrooms and central        
heating. There are no gardens at the   
front and only enclosed yards at the   
rear with communal access.
