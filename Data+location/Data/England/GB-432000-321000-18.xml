  Ted Moult is a local farmer up in    
 Ticknall. Round here he is famous for 
 his strawberries; you can go and pick 
 your own.                             
  Other people know him because he     
 appears on television and radio. He   
 does an advert for a firm that sells  
 double glazing. He drops a feather to 
 show that no draughts come through the
 window. Also he has been on a radio   
 programme called{The Archers.}        
  He went to the Derby school in Derby 
 and afterwards he went into farming.  
 He has been a farmer for forty-five   
 years and has been living here for    
 about twenty-eight years. He owns just
 under three hundred acres.
