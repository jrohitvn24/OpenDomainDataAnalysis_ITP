		<title>16DAY IN LIFE OF MRS MORRISON</title>
		<content> I GET UP AROUND 7.30 AND HAVE         
 BREAKFAST AND GET JOHN'S LUNCH PACKED 
 WHICH HE TAKES WITH HIM. THEN I GO TO 
 THE BUNGALOWS AND DO ANY SMALL JOBS   
 ETC, AND ANY SHOPPING. AT 10.30 I COME
 INTO SCHOOL AND HELP IN THE KITCHEN   
 AND THE DINING HALL,HAVE MY OWN LUNCH 
 AND GO BACK TO THE BUNGALOWS AND SPEND
 AN HOUR WITH MY MOTHER.               
 AT 4P.M. I GO INTO THE SHOP AND HELP  
 FOR TWO HOURS. AFTER LEAVING I CHECK  
 EVERYTHING IS ALRIGHT AT THER BUNGALOW
 AND GO HOME TO GET THE EVENING MEAL.  
 AFTER, I DO ANY CHORES AND PERHAPS DO 
 SOME COOKING OR GO IN THE GARDEN FOR  
 AN HOUR.                              
 AROUND 8.50PM I SIT DOWN AND READ THE 
 PAPER OR WATCH TV OR KNIT. I LIKE TO  
 RETIRE ABOUT 11PM.                    
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
