		<title>20Carlton on Trent</title>
		<content> Carlton on Trent is a picturesque     
 little village,lying between the Trent
 to the East and the Old Great North   
 Road to the West(A.1.).The houses in  
 the main are brick built cottages     
 ranging in age from 300 years old to  
 present day Council houses. The church
 is Victorian,built on the site of an  
 ancient chapel(Norwell).The Main St.  
 is dominated by beautiful Georgian    
 houses.There is a delightful          
 blacksmith's shop,with an interesting 
 horseshoe-shaped doorway.Carlton Hall,
 the Manor House, is still occupied by 
 the Vere-Laurie family,formerly       
 Squires of the village.Previously the 
 village had a Malsters Industry,but   
 now there is no industry at all in the
 village.Carlton was one of the old    
 crossing points of the Trent,(ferry to
 Holme,E. of the river).It is now a    
 residential, dormant village.         </content>
