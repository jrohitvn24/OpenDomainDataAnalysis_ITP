		<title>10COTSWOLD WALLS</title>
		<content>     My dad works on a farm.If the     
 owner says he wants a wall put up he  
 does.Sometimes I help him like handing
 my dad stones and sometimes I build a 
 little wall.Sometimes he builds walls 
 up at the farm and once he built one  
 at my friends house which is the farm 
 cottage.My dad built Lady Cromwell a  
 wall.It all started when my dad was   
 young.His father was a builder and my 
 dad helped him.Now my dad is a farmer 
 but sometimes he repairs walls for    
 people.He uses Cotswold stone.        
 Sometimes I watch my dad build        
 a wall.He shapes the stones if they   
 have not got nice faces and then he   
 will put them in place.He uses a stone
 hammer, but he does not use cement to 
 join the stones together.That is why  
 they call them dry stone walls.
