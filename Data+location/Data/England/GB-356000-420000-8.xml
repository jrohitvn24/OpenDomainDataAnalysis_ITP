		<content>  {Line Tig:}A game for five or more   
 players. We use the painted lines on  
 the playground. To start the players  
 pick someone to be 'on' who goes to   
 the middle of the pitch, counts to ten
 whilst turning around and then begins 
 to chase the other players. They must 
 run on the lines, if they do not they 
 become 'on'. When a player is touched 
 by the person who is 'on', even if he 
 is on a line, he becomes 'on' and the 
 game starts again.                    
{ Mud Man:}A game for ten or more      
 players. We use two painted circles on
 the playground as dens where you are  
 safe and a dark patch as the mud pot. 
 One person is chosen to be Mud Man and
 starts in the mud pot. The players run
 from one den to the other trying to   
 avoid being caught by the Mud Man. If 
 you are caught and taken to the mud   
 pot you become the new Mud Man.       </content>
