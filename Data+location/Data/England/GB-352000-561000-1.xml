		<content>  Brampton is a small market town with 
 about 4,000 inhabetants.It lies in the
 valley of the River Irthing 9 miles   
 north-east of Carlisle.It is not far  
 from the Scottish border and is only 3
 miles south of Hadrian's Wall.Being a 
 'Border Town',it has a colourful      
 history.It dates back to the 7th      
 century and became a market town in   
 1252,when it was granted a market     
 charter by King Henry III.It has      
 remained a market town ever since ,   
 serving the local rural communities.  
 Pastoral farming (i.e.sheep,          
 beef-cattle, and dairy-cattle)is still
 the major land use of the area. It is 
 a well-wooded district too, sheltered 
 by the Pennine Fells. Apart from      
 Brampton, settlement consists of      
 scattered farmhouses and the three    
 hamlets of Burtholme, Lanercost and   
 Boothby.                              </content>
