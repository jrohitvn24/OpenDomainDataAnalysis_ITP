		<title>14A day at Aston St.Mary's</title>
		<content>  My day starts at 7 O'CLOCK. I go down
 stairs and have a bowl of cornflakes  
 and a cup of tea.I wash, put on my    
 summer school uniform,a blue checked  
 cotton dress and white socks and read 
 untill 8.45.I only live across the    
 road from school so I meet my friends 
 at the gates.The bell goes at 9.00 we 
 line up and go in.The register is cal_
 led and  we sing a hymn in class or h_
 ave assembley,then we drink a carton  
 of milk.After play we do English and  
 Maths.For lunch we have a choice of   
 meals like Shepherd's Pie and cabbage,
 followed by Chocolate cracknel(rice   
 krispies in thick chocolate). Next we 
 play skipping,football and chasing the
 boys.In the afternoon it's topic,R.E.,
 or sports and home at 3.3O.On Wednes- 
 days I go to the youth club in village
 hall.There is a Guides company,but I  
 don't go.                             </content>
