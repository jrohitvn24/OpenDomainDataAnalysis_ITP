 I enjoy living in Sherford. It is a   
 nice place to live because there are  
 not many cars so we can ride our bikes
 without worrying. There are lots of   
 fields we aren't allowed to go in     
 because they have corn in them. Most  
 people like living in Sherford because
 it is nice and quiet, especially the  
 elderly people.                       
 Sherford has a church, village hall,  
 an old school house, an old chapel,   
 council houses, new houses and        
 bungalows, old cottages and farms.    
 Our house is an old cottage called    
 Feys Cottage. It has three bedrooms,a 
 bathroom, kitchen, hall, sittingroom  
 and lounge. I have a bedroom with my  
 brother. My dad is a farm worker. My  
 mum stays at home all day. I have     
 three brothers and a pet rabbit named 
 Flop.                                 </content>
