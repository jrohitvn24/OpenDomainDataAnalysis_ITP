 Industry in Tollerton is mostly       
 connected with joinery.One joiner is  
 the Village Undertaker and one firm   
 specialises in fencing.Previous       
 industries were brick making,tile     
 making,malting and corn milling.They  
 have disappeared now but were         
 important at the time.There is a Post 
 Office, a small supermarket,three     
 public houses and a garage.           
 West of Tollerton is a small hamlet   
 called Youlton.Youlton is a group of  
 small eighteenth century houses and   
 farm buildings.Youlton Hall is a house
 of historical interest.The Hall was   
 built in 1340.It was timber framed but
 it has since been clad in brick.You
