		<title>18Local Government, Beckenham</title>
		<content> Beckenham had an Urban District       
 Council until the re-organisation of  
 local government in London in 1963,   
 when it became part of the new London 
 Borough of Bromley. As one of the     
 outer London Boroughs, Bromley comes  
 under the authority of the G.L.C. for 
 major matters, but has responsibility 
 for its own services including        
 education, refuse collection,         
 libraries, etc. The so-called 'Old    
 Council Offices' are used for public  
 meetings, exhibitions, and for general
 hire. The Town Hall in Beckenham is   
 not required by Bromley Borough       
 Council and at the moment is being    
 used by the Citizens Advice Bureau. At
  this time we are waiting to see if   
 the proposed abolition of the G.L.c.  
 will affect services provided in this 
 area.
