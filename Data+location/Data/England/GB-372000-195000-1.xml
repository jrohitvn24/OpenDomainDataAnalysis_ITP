		<title>01Woodmancote/Nibley area</title>
		<content> Woodmancote/North Nibley is a rural   
 area lying in the shadow of the       
 Cotswold escarpment which shelters the
 villages from the cold winds. "Nib"   
 comes from "Hnybba" meaning peak.     
 "Ley" is a meadow. Woodmancote is     
 probably the "Woncot" mentioned in    
 Shakespeare's Henry IV. It is a       
 close-knit community and the area is  
 recognised by its monument to Tyndale,
 a local man.  Agriculture is the main 
 form of employment in the area but    
 many people travel elsewhere to work. 
 There is a beautiful medieval church- 
 St.Martins, on the outskirts of       
 Nibley. Woodmancote is a residential  
 area with three old- people's homes   
 and a church- St.Marks. Most people   
 from both areas shop in Dursley or    
 Wotton-under-Edge.
