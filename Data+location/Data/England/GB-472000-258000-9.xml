		<title>09THE DERNGATE CENTRE</title>
		<content>On 5th July 1985 a group of us went to 
see the Derngate Centre.We learnt quite
a lot about its building and its use.We
 discovered that the building cost Â£9M.
to erect,was begun in 1980 and finished
in 1983.The theatre part can seat a    
maximum number of 1483 people.There is 
one stage which is mobile as is the    
seating.Everything can be arranged in a
different way according to what sort of
event is being staged.Many varied shows
are put on including boxing,wrestling, 
snooker,pop groups,plays,musicals,and  
symphony concerts.There are 14 dressing
rooms to accommodate up to 70 artists. 
It is attached to the historic Royal   
Theatre(built 1884).There are several  
bars and restaurants and facilities for
conferences and dinner dances.There has
been a lot of argument about its cost  
and the burden on the local taxpayer   
but it does bring top artists to town. </content>
