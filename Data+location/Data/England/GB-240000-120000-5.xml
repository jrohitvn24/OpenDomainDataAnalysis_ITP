		<content>     THERE ARE ABOUT FIFTY-TWO         
 DIFFERENT GAMES PLAYED IN THE SCHOOL  
 PLAYGROUND.                           
     THERE ARE MORE CHASING SORTS OF   
 GAMES THAN THE REST.                  
     I WOULD SAY THAT THE LITTLE ONES  
 PLAYED MOST OF THE{ACTING}AND{CHASING 
 GAMES.THE OLDER ONES PLAY THE{THROWING
 AND{DODGING}GAMES MORE THAN THE

     THE{JUMPING,SKIPPING}AND{RACING   
 GAMES ARE PLAYED BY MORE OR LESS EVERY
 ONE.

 PERSON WHO IS IT HAS COUNTED TO  20

 CAUGHT YOU HAVE TO STAND WITH YOUR    
 LEGS APART AND YOU HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL </content>
