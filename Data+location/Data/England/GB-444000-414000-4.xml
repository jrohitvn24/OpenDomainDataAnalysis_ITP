		<content>     Attitudes In Thorpe Audlin        
    Peoples attitudes towards Thorpe   
 Audlin vary tremendously.Young people 
 feel that there should be more        
 entertainment in the village.Old      
 people feel that there should be more 
 facilities to get them from one place 
 to another.Parents and middle aged    
 people think that Thorpe Audlin is    
 just right and think that nothing in  
 the village should be changed.This    
 however is only the majority of       
 peoples' feelings,not everyone thinks 
 like this.Most people think that      
 Thorpe Audlin is pretty and pleasant  
 to look at and drive through.Lots of  
 people like it because it has many old
 buildings and lots of country side.
