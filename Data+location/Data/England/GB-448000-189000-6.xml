		<content> MRS.MUSSON AND MR.EVANS ARE BOTH      
 WELL-KNOWN AND ESTABLISHED CHARACTERS 
 IN DIDCOT. BEFORE THE 1970S, DIDCOT   
 WAS NOT A TOWN BUT TWO VILLAGES,      
 NORTHBOURNE AND DIDCOT. DURING THE    
 NINETEENTH CENTURY THE TOWN GREW      
 UP TO SERVICE THE NEW RAILWAY; THE    
 ARMY BARRACKS AND HARWELL A.E.R.E.    
 ALSO INCREASED DIDCOT'S POPULATION    
 AND EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES.         
 MR.EVANS, HOWEVER, DISAPPROVES OF THE 
 TOWN'S EXPANSION. DIDCOT, HE FEELS,   
 HAS LOST ITS CLOSE-KNIT COMMUNITY,    
 MANY OF THE INHABITANTS NOT HAVING    
 BEEN BORN THERE. MRS.MUSSON HAS NOTED 
 THE INCREASING ISOLATION OF WEST      
 DIDCOT FROM THE REST OF THE TOWN      
 ALTHOUGH IT HAS SOME WIDELY-USED      
 AMENITIES SUCH AS THE HEALTH CENTRE   
 AND THE LADYGROVE DAY CENTRE. MORE    
 GARDENS, ANOTHER DAY CENTRE, BETTER   
 TRAVEL FACILITIES NEEDED              </content>
