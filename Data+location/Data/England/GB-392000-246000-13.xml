		<content>       Pershore Carnival               
                                       
 Every Bank Holiday 25th May           
 Pershore has a Carnival.We have       
 different kinds of floats of different
 scenes.Our School did a float and we  
 did Alice In Wonderland.We go on the  
 route down the High Street and        
 round.Usually people throw money on   
 the floats for charity.When the floats
 are going round people stand in crowds
 along the sides of the roads and shout
 and throw money onto the floats.When  
 we have gone all the way round the    
 judges pick the winning floats.The    
 people from the winning floats go down
 onto the Abbey field where the swings 
 are and collect their prizes and cups.
 Affter the Carnival there usually is a
 fair so the children have a good time.
 The winning float of the whole        
 Carnival wins Â£50. for themselves.    </content>
