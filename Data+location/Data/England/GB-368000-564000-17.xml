		<content>   To the west of Haltwhistle, set     
 among stately, mature trees, stands   
 Blenkinsopp Hall, a large country     
 house, home of the Joicey family. Both
 entrances are guarded by lodges and a 
 mile long drive leads to the Hall.  It
 has battlements, a courtyard, stable  
 block and laundry rooms.              
   The late Major Joicey's mother was  
 Violet Lorraine, a famous actress of  
 the London Stage.  The Major's widow  
 lives alone in half of the Hall but is
 regularly visited by her three        
 daughters and their families.         
   Bungalows which used to house estate
 workers now provide homes for people  
 who work in Haltwhistle.  An estate   
 manager looks after the farms and     
 property on the estate.  A gardener is
 employed and each year the gardens are
 opened to the public to raise money   
 for charity.                          </content>
