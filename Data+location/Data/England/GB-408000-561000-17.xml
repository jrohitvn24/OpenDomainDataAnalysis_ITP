		<title>17EDGEWELL FARM, PRUDHOE</title>
		<content> Mr. Lowdon owns 150 acres of farm     
 land. He has owned it since 1928 but  
 does not known how old it is. He uses 
 25 acres for wheat, 55 acres for      
 barley, 1 acre for potatoes, 2 acres  
 for turnips. He uses the rest of the  
 land for hay and pasture. Mr. Lowdon  
 said that the amount of land he owns  
 will stay the same in the future. The 
 farm is run by Mr. Lowdon's son and   
 himself. They do mixed farming because
 if one crop doesn't make as much money
 as expected there is always another   
 crop to sell. He buys two different   
 types of cow charolais and heifers    
 (which cost about Â£250 each).         
                                       
 Footnote: Edgewell Farm is to the     
 north of the A695 Halfway, Prudhoe.
