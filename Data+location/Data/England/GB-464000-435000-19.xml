		<content>Several independent bus companies      
operate services through the area      
although their depots are outside the  
D-Block. Thornes Motor Services, from  
nearby Bubwith, serve the scattered    
houses and farms near the A163 with    
their Bubwith to Selby route. Thornes, 
Gorwood Coaches and Philips Coach      
Company provide school bus services to 
Barlby High School picking up the few  
pupils who live in the D-Block. Most of
these buses are single deckers,        
including some vintage vehicles. There 
is no Sunday bus service. An hour long 
midweek traffic census along the A 163 
recorded a total of 108 vehicles (72   
cars, 16 lorries, 10 vans,3 motor      
bikes, 1 tractor and 1 coach. The most 
popular van was the Ford Transit and   
the most recorded car was the Ford     
Escort.
