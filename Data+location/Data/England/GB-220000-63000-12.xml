		<title>12FACILITIES FOR YOUNG PEOPLE</title>
		<content>   YOUNG PEOPLE COMPLAIN HERE AS       
 EVERYWHERE ELSE, THAT THERE IS NOTHING
 FOR THEM TO DO. THEY SAY IT HERE WITH 
 SOME JUSTIFICATION.                   
   FOR SMALL KIDS, THERE ARE BEAVERS,  
 CUBS AND SCOUTS, GIRLS BRIGADE,       
 BROWNIES AND GIRL GUIDES.A PLAY GROUP 
 AND MOTHER AND TODDLER GROUPS ALSO    
 MEET.                                 
   A YOUTH CLUB STARTED IN 1982 AND    
 MEETS ON WEDNESDAYS ONLY. IT HAS JUST 
 ACQUIRED A HUT OF ITS OWN,AND HOPES TO
 MEET MORE OFTEN.                      
  THERE IS A CARNIVAL WEEK EVERY YEAR, 
 WHICH RAISES MONEY FOR LOCAL          
 CHARITIES.                            
  THERE IS NO DISCO, OR CAFE IN THE    
 BLOCK AND NO BUS SERVICES AT NIGHT.   
 THE NEAREST CINEMA IS IN PLYMOUTH, AS 
 IS THE NEAREST THEATRE. DANCE, GYM AND
 JUDO CLASSES ETC. ALL TAKE PLACE      
 OUTSIDE THE BLOCK.                    </content>
