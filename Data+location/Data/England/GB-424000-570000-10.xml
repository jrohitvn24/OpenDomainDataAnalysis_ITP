		<content> There are several other interesting   
places close to the Gosforth Park Hotel
such as Squash Newcastle,a club with   
over 400 members.There are 6 courts    
including one which is a glass backed  
international court.One of our pupils  
is a member of the club and the U14    
county champion.Along the North Road is
the Sacred Heart Church,built in 1875  
as an Anglican Church and purchased by 
the Catholics in 1908.At the moment the
Church is temporarily closed while     
restoration work is carried out. A hut 
has been provided so that the 300      
members of the congregation can carry  
on meeting as usual.People travel from 
within a radius of 2 miles in order to 
come to services at the Church and     
about 50% of these attend regularly.   
Along Sandy Lane there is an industrial
estate with an M.O.T. testing station  
for heavy goods vehicles.              </content>
