		<content> THE HOMES IN TUDELEY CONSIST MAINLY OF
 FARMS, AGRICULTURAL WORKERS COTTAGES  
 AND BUNGALOWS, (SOME MODERNISED, SOME 
 NEW), TWO GROUPS OF COUNCIL HOUSES    
 (MANY NOW OWNER OCCUPIED) AND SOME    
 FINE PROPERTIES IN POSTERN LANE. THERE
 ARE SEVERAL CONVERTED OASTS AND BARNS,
 CONSIDERED HIGHLY DESIRABLE.          
{BECAUSE OF NEW TECHNOLOGY AND GREATER 
{MECHANIZATION FARMERS NOW EMPLOY LESS 
{THAN A 1/4 OF FORMER WORKERS, CAUSING 
{A RADICAL CHANGE IN LOCAL EMPLOYMENT.}
 SCHOOL RECORDS SHOW THAT 100 YEARS AGO
 NEARLY 1/2 THE FATHERS WERE LABOURERS 
 AND THE REST A RICH VARIETY OF MAINLY 
 MANUAL WORKERS - BLACKSMITHS, CARTERS,
 CHARCOAL BURNERS AND WHEELWRIGHTS ETC.
 NAVVIES, PLATELAYERS AND ENGINEDRIVERS
 REVEALED THE ADVENT OF THE RAILWAY.   
 FEW FATHERS WORK ON THE LAND NOW. MANY
 COMMUTE TO LONDON OR WORK IN LOCAL    
 OFFICES, FACTORIES AND IN TRADE.      </content>
