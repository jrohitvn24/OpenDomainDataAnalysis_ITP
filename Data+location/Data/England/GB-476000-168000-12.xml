		<title>12WOOSEHILL'S CHANGING SCENE</title>
		<content> The Woosehill area of Wokingham has   
 changed drastically in the past 6     
 years.Old inhabitants recall woods,   
 fields and farms,where now are roads  
 and hundreds of new homes.            
 The Riverside Walk has been retained  
 as an area of open space, but many    
 feel the houses are too crowded and   
 much more is needed in the way of play
 area for children.                    
 On the edge of the estate stands a C15
 timber framed cottage, once a dairy   
 farm,which provides an element of     
 contrast.It is in the process of being
 restored,and the present owners       
 propose to open it to school parties  
 as an educational resource.At the     
 opposite side of the road is the      
 Safeway shop and community centre with
 its doctors'surgery.                  
                                       
                                       </content>
