		<content>      The{Yorkshire Water Authority    
 controls 10,000 miles of sewers, which
 take sewage to 608 works. The majority
 of works were built at roughly the    
 same time and some are now crumbling  
 with age.                             
      The{Y.W.A.}has, therefore,       
 decided to spend{Â£19.2 million}on     
 phasing out nine of the smaller works 
 in the greater Leeds area and plumbing
 them into an upgraded{Knostrop.       
      The demise of the smaller works  
 will mean cleaner water courses and an
 annual saving of{Â£457,000.}To have    
 renovated and rebuilt the outlying    
 works to an acceptable standard would 
 have cost{Â£21.3 million.              
   {  Knostrop}will now be expanded and
 improved, at a cost of{Â£14 million.}To
 complete the link with other works    
 will cost{Â£5.2 million.
