		<title>04HUDDERSFIELD INDUSTRY</title>
		<content> Huddersfield is an industrial town in 
 the Heavy Woollen District of West    
 Yorkshire.  There are many industries 
 in our area.  Large, small,           
 engineering, textiles, gears, sports  
 gear,but the main area is along the   
 valley of the River Colne.            
 The valley has the canal, railway     
 and the main Leeds Road, there is much
 old industry in this area.  The       
 whole area is changing.  We saw the   
 large mill being knocked down, and    
 when we asked a worker he said the    
 whole area had been demolished,       
 including the Cooling Towers which    
 were blown-up.  The Gasworks is still 
 there and a mill and a very large     
 engineering works.  One or two new    
 factories have opened.  They are only 
 one storey high and very clean        
 looking. .
