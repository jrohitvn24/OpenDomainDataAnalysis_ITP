		<content>     One very recent development has   
 been the publication of               
 the first edition of the{Brafferton   
{and Coatham Mundeville Newsletter.    
                                       
    It is intended that the publication
 should take place{quarterly}in an     
 effort to improve communications      
 within the district and at the same   
 time give residents an opportunity to 
 air their views and stimulate comment.
                                       
    The{first edition}contained details
 of the Summer Fete, information on the
 Village Hall Association as well as a 
 number of classified advertisements.  
 There was also advanced notice of the 
 formation of a{computer club}open to  
 the interested of all ages. The first 
 meeting is planned for September.
