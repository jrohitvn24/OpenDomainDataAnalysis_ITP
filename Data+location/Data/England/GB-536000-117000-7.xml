 race is a relay and the teams leave at
 one minute intervals. The first part  
 of the relay is running. the runners  
 go through the grounds of the school  
 and touch the railings by the road.   
 This is the signal for the cyclists to
 start.                                
 After the cyclists there are horses   
 and riders, ladies and their dogs,    
 canoeists obstacle sections and       
 others.
