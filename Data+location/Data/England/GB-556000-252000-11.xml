		<content> The National Farmers' Union Guidelines
 for straw/stubble burning has meant   
 that more stubble will be ploughed    
 into the ground this year, but a      
 smokey haze and charred straw on the  
 wind from stubble burning, still      
 troubles many counties during         
 September.Nevertheless, this is       
 considered by the farmers to be the   
 most effective way of disposing of    
 straw and legislation to deter burning
 would mean considerable inconvenience 
 and perhaps reduced profits for the   
 farmers. If straw is not burned it    
 has to be ploughed in at the rate of  
 one and a half tons per acre, which   
 has a detrimental effect on the soil, 
 and therefore the following crop. The 
 major pests are pigeons, which peck   
 the shoots of the rape during winter  
 and rabbits which are controlled by   
 the disease mixamatosis.              </content>
