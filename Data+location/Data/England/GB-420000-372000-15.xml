		<content> Local farms are mostly engaged in the 
 rearing of animals. Calves are bred   
 and reared before being sold south and
 sheep are also raised. The animals are
 often taken to Bakewell market for    
 sale on Mondays, in cattle wagons or  
 horse boxes.                          
 One farm on the hill leading out of   
 Calver village (B.6001) keeps goats   
 and advertises that both milk and     
 cheese is for sale.                   
 Another animal which is frequently    
 seen in the fields of the area is the 
 horse or pony. It is the fashion to   
 keep one for the children, and farmers
 find it an additional source of       
 income.                               
 Wild animals include foxes, rabbits,  
 squirrels, voles and badgers.
