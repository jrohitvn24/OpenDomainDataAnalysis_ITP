		<title>10Improving Peterlee.</title>
		<content>{Peterlee}could be improved by having  
 larger normal playgrounds,an adventure
 playground and an outdoor swimming    
 pool.{The Leisure Centre}could be     
 improved by putting in a big water    
 slide so it would be more fun,because 
 it costs 45p to go swimming,which is a
 bit expensive. The town could also do 
 with a{cinema.                        
 Houses with{flat roofs}could be       
 improved by having pointed roofs put  
 on to stop roofs from leaking any     
 more.{Condensation problems}could be  
 cured if the council put double       
 glazing into houses and repaired damp 
 walls.                                
{Peterlee}is clean in most places,but  
 it could be made more atractive by    
 planting more flower_beds and by      
 people putting litter into bins or    
 taking it home with them.
