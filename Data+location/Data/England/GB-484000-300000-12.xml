		<content> Glaston road links the southern       
 boundary of the study area with the   
 new Uppingham by-pass. Certain        
 features are obvious from the Ordnance
 Survey map. A public footpath, passing
 near to Launde Farm, parallels the    
 road along its western edge. There is 
 a discrepancy between the O.S. map    
 (Rutland Water, 1982) and J. E.       
 Garbett's Footpath map (Sheet 144) in 
 that the latter does not show a       
 footpath connection with Glaston      
 Road.A pamphlet has recently been     
 issued by  Leicestershire County      
 Council called{Leicestershire Rights} 
{of Way.}This makes reference to a     
{Definitive Map and Statement}which is 
 a legal record of public rights of    
 way.
