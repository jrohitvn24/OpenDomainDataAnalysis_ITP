		<content> middle of the 12th century and a      
 Quaker Chapel built in 1881.          
      Elsenham and the surrounding area
 still has a large number of old houses
 and thatched cottages, open fields and
 public footpaths but it is modern     
 housing that predominates; mainly 3   
 bedroom or large semi-detached or     
 detached houses.                      
      The expansion of Stansted Airport
 is the issue of the moment.  It is    
 likely to bring emloyment to the area,
 but also an increase in noise.  It is 
 expected that Elsenham railway station
 will expand, and that there will be   
 much building of houses and roads were
 the consequent rise in house prices.  
 Many people, though, fear that the    
 rural nature and peace of the area    
 will be destroyed.
