		<title>04LAND OWNERSHIP AND VALUE.</title>
		<content> We are working in an area of twelve   
 squares,{11.5}of which the Duke of    
 Northumberland owns.He does not own   
 some parts of Lesbury and Hipsburn    
 villages.1 square on our map=1 sq.km. 
 We estimated how much the Duke would  
 receive if he sold our block.To buy   
 one acre of agricultural land today   
 would cost approximately{Â£1500.}There 
 are 2.471 acres to one hectare,and    
 one hundred hectares in one sq.km.    
 Therefore there are 247.1 acres in one
 hectare.There are 11.5 squares,so in  
 our area there are 2841.7 acres. Since
 each acre costs Â£1500 in all the Duke 
 would receive{about Â£4 262 550}for his
 land.He also owns the minerals under  
 his land.                             
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
