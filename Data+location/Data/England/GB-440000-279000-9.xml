		<title>09The Rector of Brinklow</title>
		<content> The Rector of Brinklow is responsible 
 for the churches around Newbold Revel 
 Manor.He resides in the Rectory which 
 is situated along Coventry Road.      
 Services are held every Sunday while  
 the children's church takes place on  
 the 2nd Sunday of every month. Annual 
 church events include Wake Service    
 which is held on the 1st Sunday in    
 July and the Harvest Festival in      
 September. The present Rector, Rev.   
 White who has lived in Brinklow since 
 July 1982 does not think that he has  
 been in the village long enough to    
 notice any major changes. He would,if 
 possible,like to see more social      
 contact between the people living at  
 opposite ends of the village.         
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
