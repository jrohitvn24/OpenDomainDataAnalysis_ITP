 butcher (twice weekly). There is a    
 free weekly bus service to the        
 supermarket at Boro'bridge, a distance
 of about eight kilometres.            
                                       
  Moorcock Hall Farm, at Scotton, ia a 
 farm shop which produces its own

 and sell turkeys.                     
                                       
  Nearby there is a breeder of         
 Labradors.                            
                                       
  There is also a family business of   
 joiners and undertakers in this area.
