		<title>04Interview of a Vicar.</title>
		<content> Mr. Martin is vicar of five parishes. 
   We interviewed Mr Martin in the     
 small church in Upleadon. The church  
 itself has expanded from an old Norman
 building with some Saxon parts dating 
 from the C9 or C10.The church has many
 visitors and a wide range of services 
 with 10 to 25+ people attending.      
 Upleadon has a population of 200, all 
 of whom have goodwill to the building.
{  What are the problems of running    
{five parishes?}The major factor is    
 sharing time equally between the      
 parishes.Another problem is the upkeep
 of the buildings.The five churches are
 continually needing repairs leaving   
 the churches in debt.For example this 
 church was closed and declared unsafe.
 The cost of repairs was Â£11,000.      
 Although we are helped by a church    
 group some money still has to come    
 from charity.                         </content>
