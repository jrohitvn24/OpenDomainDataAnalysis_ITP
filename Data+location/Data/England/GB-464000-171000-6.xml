		<content> As with the vast majority of schools  
 in this country,the 3 R's,'reading,   
 writing,and arithmetic',still form the
 major part of the school curriculum.  
   Much thought has gone into thinking 
 about what should be taught and how.  
 Math now has far greater emphasis on  
 practical work,working on the premise 
 that when children DO,they UNDERSTAND.
 Science has also received attention   
 and far more encouragement is being   
 given to it,as is the case with the   
 newly introduced 'computers'.         
   The school day in most cases begins 
 at or about 9 am.Most children will   
 have a short break for play during the
 morning before stopping for lunch at  
 about 12am.Afternoon school begins in 
 most schools at about 1 pm(1300 hrs). 
 There may be an afternoon play        
 before school ends at about 3 pm.     
   Most children enjoy school greatly  </content>
