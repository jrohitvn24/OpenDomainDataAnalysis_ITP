		<content> The landscape is predominantly        
 downland farming on chalky soil,      
 largely sloping southwards. the farms 
 are mainly arable but with some       
 pasture and deciduous woodland        
 interspersed. The farm units are at   
 approximately one kilometre intervals.
 There is one small village which has  
 very limited services and is largely  
 populated by commuters and retired    
 people. The farms are managed by the  
 minimum number of workers and the     
 maximum amount of machinery.
