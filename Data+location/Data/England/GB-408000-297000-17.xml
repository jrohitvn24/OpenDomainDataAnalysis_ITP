		<title>17Four Oaks - Social Concerns</title>
		<content> Although Four Oaks has always been    
 considered an area associated with    
 much wealth and unlimited resources it
 still has its problems.The very nature
 of the environment has in itself led  
 to some of these problems.One of these
 is housing,not the lack of it,but the 
 desire to build more and more.This has
 of course caused great controversy    
 among the people in the areas directly
 affected by such plans.The area to the
 north of Lindrosa Road is considered  
 one of outstanding natural rarity.Here
 wild plants and creatures exist in a  
 habitat that has existed for 'ages'   
 and without which they would die out. 
 Great concern is being shown by the   
 local residents about plans to build  
 over this unique domain.Other schemes 
 for building in the area are also     
 being monitored very carefully to     
 prevent overcrowding.                 </content>
