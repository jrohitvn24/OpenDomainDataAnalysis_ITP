		<title>09WESTON VILLAGE FLOUR MILL.</title>
		<content> The{flour mill}was built in{1860}and  
 is a mile from the village centre.    
 The first owners emigrated to America 
 and the mill was taken over by the    
{Pryors, an important Hertfordshire    
{family.}Their descendants, including a
 pupil at the school, now live there.  
 The Mill is one of the few now        
 remaining in Hertfordshire.           
 All the{machinery}has been taken out  
 of the mill but there is a mill stone 
 in front of the house covering a well.
 There are two{adjacent fields used for
{cattle or hay}, it was probably used  
 for grazing or corn before when       
 the first owners lived there.{Planning
{permission}is now being sought to turn
 the mill into a house by joining the  
 mill tower onto an existing barn. This
 will arrest decay.                    
 Permission for this has recently been 
 refused by the local authority.       </content>
