		<content> We did a survey to find out which     
meals people ate at home. For breakfast
most children had cereals. The most    
popular were Corn Flakes and Weetabix. 
Other children had toast. Six children 
had no breakfast.                      
 Most children ate chips at least once 
a day either at lunchtime or at        
teatime. The other meal is usually a   
sandwich.                              
 Nearly all of the class ate their     
evening meal whilst watching the T.V.  
with their plate on their laps.        
 Most children had their Sunday dinner 
about 1.00 p.m. Roast Chicken or Roast 
Pork was the most common dinner but    
others had Roast Beef, Pork Chops or   
Sausage and Chips.                     
 Class favourites were :- Breakfast -  
Mixed Grill. Sandwich - Salad. Main    
meal - Chips with almost anything.
