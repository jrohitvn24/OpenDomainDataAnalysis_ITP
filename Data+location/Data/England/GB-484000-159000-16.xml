		<title>16A Theosophist Community</title>
		<content> Tekels Park is a Theosophist estate.  
 It is not a cult or a religion but a  
 sort of association of people who     
 believe in a{divine being.}They are   
 also{vegetarians.}The original house, 
 The Coach House, has its kitchen      
 garden divided into allotments for the
 inhabitants to grow vegetables on.    
 They all have individual houses       
 elsewhere in the estate.              
                                       
 The property is{private,}making it    
 impossible to go and walk in the      
 grounds.                              
                                       
 Tekels Park claims to have a{ghost.}  
 She is apparently about 5'5", wears a 
 white robe and only appears at parties
 given by the descendents of the Burns.
 She is seen sitting under the light,  
 but if anyone attempts to speak to her
 she disappears.                       </content>
