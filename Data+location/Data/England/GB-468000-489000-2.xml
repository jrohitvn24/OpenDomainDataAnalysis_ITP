		<title>02Tourism Hutton-le-Hole Area</title>
		<content> To the north of this area tourists are
 attracted by the open nature of the   
 moorland.There are no buildings or    
 fences to prevent them from sitting or
 wandering near becks or on open land, 
 or just stopping to admire the view.  
 There has been a great increase in day
 tourists in recent years,and many city
 dwellers come to relax and enjoy them-
 selves. In the southern farming part  
 of the area there are beautiful views 
 from open roadside spaces and woods,  
 and there are many bridleways and foot
 -paths. Little children need no other 
 entertainment than playing in the     
 becks.People come to enjoy the beauty 
 and peace and the great contrast from 
 town life. Some come to visit the Folk
 Museum, and many have a cup of tea, an
 ice-cream, or patronize the shops.
