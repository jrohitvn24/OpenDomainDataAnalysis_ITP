		<title>07FARMING 3</title>
		<content> Farming has become more intensive     
 because of increased availability of  
 fertilisers,which enables farmers to  
 keep more stock.More mechanisation has
 decreased the number of farmworkers by
 about a quarter.                      
 The advent of electricity and an      
 indoor water supply revolutionised the
 life of the farmer's wife.            
                                       
 A typical farm in the region would be 
 Coldwell,which is an independant      
 farm,of 300 acres run by farmer and 1 
 hind.Hay is the only crop grown.The   
 farmer keeps cows and calves and black
 faced ewes.The fields are enclosed    
 with sod cast dykes,there are newly   
 planted and old woods for shelter.He  
 keeps twice as many sheep now ,has    
 changed from horses to tractors,has   
 fewer farm buildings and has changed  
 from store cattle to cows and calves. </content>
