		<content> Cyril Tyson judges Lakeland Terriers. 
 He also breeds them. His terriers all 
 have names beginning with M. He feeds 
 them on meat and hard boiled eggs.    
 They are fed once a day unless they   
 are pups that have left their mum and 
 are under six months. For every dog he
 has one licence. He goes to sixty to  
 seventy shows a year. He clips them   
 one month before they are to be shown.
 The pups start their training at a    
 very early age. The training starts   
 with the pups chasing a dead sparrow  
 through a pipe. When it gets to the   
 end it is given a bit of meat. On     
 average the bitches have seven pups at
 a time. If two dogs start to fight    
 they can be parted if they are picked 
 up and turned upside down. The kennels
 are cleaned out every morning.
