		<title>19Superstitions and Sayings.</title>
		<content>  Because there are few inhabitants    
 indigenous to the area local          
 superstitions and sayings are         
 difficult to record. The few          
 discovered have been given by local   
 women all of whom at some time or     
 other have worked for the Lopes       
 household and/or Maristow Estate.     
  "No one should buy a broom in May for
 fear of brushing someone out the door"
  "Touch your cap/forelock to a lone   
 magpie and say,'Good morning Mr       
 Magpie', otherwise bad luck will      
 befall you".                          
  "If when standing at 'Pound' you hear
 a train crossing Warleigh bridge it's 
 going to rain. If you hear traffic on 
 the main road it's going to be a fine 
 day".                                 
  The pub "Who'd Have Thought It", is  
 supposed to be haunted by a'crinolin' 
 lady and an ex-landlord, Abe Beer.    </content>
