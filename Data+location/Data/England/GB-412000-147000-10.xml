		<content>{  THE GREY LADY OF FIGHELDEAN.        
  One day an airman,who had permission 
 to play the organ, was in the church  
 at about 10 o'clock. He suddenly saw a
 grey figure walking towards him, it   
 continued till it reached the altar.  
 He was so frightened he would never   
 enter the church again.               
{ PETER WITCHELL.                      
  Recently a farmhouse was having      
 central heating put in for new owners 
 The workmen were terrified when they  
 saw a figure huddled in a corner.     
 After describing what they had seen   
 villagers surprised them by saying    
 they had accurately described the     
 farmer who had previously lived there.
 The workmen refused to finish the job.
