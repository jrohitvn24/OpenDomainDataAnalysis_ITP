		<content> Hanging around on the corner of the   
 street,                               
 The three old bobbies on the beat.    
                                       
 Knocking on doors and running away,   
 this is the life we lead today.       
                                       
 There's no-where to go so what shall  
 we do,                                
 Let's go to the park and sniff some   
 glue!                                 
                                       
 Our mothers nag, at us being at home  
 This is why we run and roam.          
                                       
 Some people take drugs around here,   
 Some from fright and some from fear.  
                                       
 Young people drink, smoke and take    
 drugs just to look hard,              
 but some lay death down as their      
 cards.                                </content>
