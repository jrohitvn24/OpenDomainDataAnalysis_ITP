		<title>05A MIXED FARM IN LYDFORD</title>
		<content>   Today we visited a mixed farm called
 Battishill, half a mile from the      
 village to the West.It is 250 acres   
 and is run by the farmer with one man 
 working part-time.He showed us around 
 the farm.                             
   First we saw the sheds where the    
 machinery is kept and where the stock 
 is kept in the Winter.He keeps some   
 bullocks for fattening and some sheep 
 and lambs. He sells the bullocks at   
 Hatherleigh Market,also the lambs.The 
 sheep are shorn in the Spring and he  
 sells the wool.                       
   The farmer makes silage and hay to  
 feed the stock and grows Winter and   
 Spring barley for feed.The rest of the
 fields are used for grazing.          
   We saw the fields of barley and the 
 bullocks and sheep.The sheep need a   
 lot of care with dipping,drenching and
 tail docking.                         </content>
