		<title>05POWER STATION RICHBOROUGH</title>
		<content> The power station at Richborough was  
 commissioned in 1962.  180 people work
 there and most of these people live   
 near to it.  5 to 8 people man the    
 station at night.  An 8 hour day is   
 worked.                               
{Cooling:} The cooling water(10 million
 gallons per hour - recycled) is taken 
 from the Stour into 3 cooling towers. 
{Oil:} The oil is brought from the     
 refineries via the River Thames to    
 Ramsgate by barges and then to the    
 station via road tankers.  This takes 
 50 journeys for every 1000 tonne load.
{Gas:} To convert from expensive oil to
 cheap gas it would cost over Â£1,000000
 but as Richborough is only a back up  
 station this is not feasible.         
{Output:} The maximum is 356-380 MW,   
 achieved in the 84/85 miners strike   
 proving the value of this station.
