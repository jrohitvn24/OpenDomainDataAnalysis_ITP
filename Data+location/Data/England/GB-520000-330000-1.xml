		<title>01GOSBERTON VILLAGE</title>
		<content> This part of Gosberton is dominated by
 the large, very beauutiful church of  
 St. Peter and St. Paul of the Norman, 
 decorated and perpendicular periods.  
 Close to the church is Gosberton      
 House, a Georgian house in a park, it 
 has had additions built and is now a  
 school for the educationally          
 sub-normal. There is a large amount of
 residential developmenting the        
 village, it has a compact shopping    
 centre and good bus service. The land 
 is very flat, very fertile and        
 extensively farmed. Crops grown are   
 potatoes, sugar beet, wheat,          
 vegetables, tulips and daffodils. Most
 of the farms are quite small, 50 to   
 100 acres. Because the land is low it 
 has to be well drained and the fields 
 are surrounded by "dykes" which carry 
 the surplus water out to the wash.
