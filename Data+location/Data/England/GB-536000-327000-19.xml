		<title>19Housing etc.;the Hurn block.</title>
		<content> 1983 figures obtained from Holbeach   
 library give the population of        
 Holbeach Hurn as 166,with 64 occupied 
 dwellings inside the village          
 boundary.This could probably be       
 doubled if all the isolated houses in 
 this block are included.About 1\ miles
 from the village is a row of          
 semi-detatched houses built for       
 soldiers returning from the First     
 World War.They are called Crown Colony
 and had one acre of land each plus a  
 packing shed.Many buildings are       
 old,and have been modernised but      
 retain their character.There are a lot
 of tied cottages,although some are now
 being sold.Holbeach Hurn has a short  
 avenue of council houses built in the 
 1930's.There are 6 purpose built old  
 peoples bungalows sited near the shop 
 and telephone.There are many old,     
 large,family farmhouse from the 1800s.</content>
