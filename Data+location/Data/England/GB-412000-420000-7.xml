		<title>07SOCIAL SURVEY (1)</title>
		<content>    A one in ten sample survey was     
 taken by a group of 8/9 year olds,in  
 three different one square kilometre  
 areas,representing a cross section of 
 the population of Rastrick.           
    Three types of housing were found: 
 (1)Council estates,                   
 (2)Older private properties, and      
 (3)Modern detached or semi-detached   
    houses and bungalows.              
    About 85% of all those interviewed 
 were owner-occupiers. The majority of 
 those sampled lived in houses or      
 bungalows, rather than in flats or    
 lodgings. About a quarter of the      
 sample were old age, or retirement,   
 pensioners.                           
 EMPLOYMENT. This sample showed that   
 there were about 8% unemployed in the 
 area, lower than the average of 14%   
 currently unemployed in Calderdale as 
 a whole.                              </content>
