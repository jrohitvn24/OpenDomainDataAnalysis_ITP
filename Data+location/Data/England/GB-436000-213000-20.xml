		<content>                                       
At school we have two playtimes.When we
come to school we have lessons until   
10.30.At 10.30 we have a play for 20   
minutes.During this playtime we play   
chase, cricket or breakdancing.Chase is
a game were somebody is "IT" and they  
chase after somebody and tig them or   
catch them.Cricket is a game using a   
bat and ball.To win you have to score  
the most runs.Breakdancing is where    
you jump onto the floor and make funny 
shapes.After play we go into school for
a lesson.At 12.10 we have lunch we go  
out at 12.30 and we might play what we 
played at little play.After this play  
we come back into class and work until 
3.15, then it's time to go home.
