		<title>19Events at Water C.P.School</title>
		<content> Whilst working on this Domesday Survey
 we had many events at school. The     
 biggest was our school concert, held  
 on two nights which had every child in
 the school(100 pupils)taking part     
 either acting or singing songs from   
 musicals. Even some of our mums and   
 dads did a special song.              
   We had a sports evening with races  
 for all children, prizes for the      
 winners, and the organisers, the      
 Parent-Teacher Association sold pop   
 and crisps.                           
   Many of the Junior children went in 
 a party of 45 to the Isle of Wight for
 a holiday in July. It was a long coach
 journey for us but we visited many    
 sights and had lots of fun on the     
 beach, in castles and adventure parks.
   We also enjoyed local walks and     
 finding out things for this Domesday  
 Survey.                               </content>
