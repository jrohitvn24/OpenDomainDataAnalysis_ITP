		<title>04LIFEBOAT MEMORIES SWANAGE</title>
		<content>   During the war a Greek steamer the  
 "Turkia" loaded with grain came ashore
 in Chapman's Pool. The lifeboat was   
 called out and stayed with the steamer
 for two nights. Then the sea began to 
 get rougher and the crew had to       
 abandon ship. Twenty-six of them were 
 brought back to Swanage.              
   The rough weather abated the next   
 day, so the crew went on board again. 
 Tugs eventually floated her and towed 
 her into Portland during the weekend. 
 This rescue lasted for seventy-four   
 hours.                                
   Many aircraft were shot down over   
 Swanage Bay during the war, although  
 the lifeboat never actually picked    
 anyone out of the sea.                
   The shortest rescue ever was when   
 three ladies were cut off by the tide 
 as the lifeboat was passing. They were
 rescued within minutes.               </content>
