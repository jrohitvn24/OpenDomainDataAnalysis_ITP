		<title>02Housing in Hunton</title>
		<content>   Hunton is an attractive village with
 a mixture of very old and new  housing
 styles.  Old Hall and Manor House  are
 17th century Listed Buildings and many
 of the cottages are built  in the same
 traditional style of coursed rubble or
 cut stone. Few though still have their
 original slate roofs or sash windows. 
  Lots of the older houses have changed
 hands in recent years and several have
 been  completely  renovated. Seven are
 now  holiday homes.  16 Council houses
 and 5 pensioners' bungalows were built
 between 1950/60.Some fairly new modern
 houses and  suburban  style  bungalows
 extend westwards and others are spread
 about the village.A small estate of 12
 timber framed houses, started in 1981,
 is still unfinished.   Sales are slow.
 ALL property prices are high and  WELL
 beyond the reach of locals, yet  there
 are no plans to provide more houses.  </content>
