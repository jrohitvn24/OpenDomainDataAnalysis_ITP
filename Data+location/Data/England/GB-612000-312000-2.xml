 many old ones have been knocked down, 
 including a row of cottages and 6     
 other houses. A number of new ones    
 have been built and 3 barns converted.
 Some are council houses or tied       
 cottages.                             
      The{manor house}in the village   
 has been knocked down. The 300 year   
 old{tithe barn}has been demolished and
 some of the wood was used for the     
{village sign,}which shows many of the 
 residents' signatures.{Westgate House 
 has been rebuilt and the reading room 
 turned into the village hall.         
      The village is so isolated that  
 the most widely used{fuel}is bottled

{office,}providing them with a major   
 source of income.
