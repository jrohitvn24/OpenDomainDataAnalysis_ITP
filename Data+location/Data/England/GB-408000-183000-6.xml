		<title>06Hook Farm</title>
		<content> Like most dairy farms Hook Farm has   
 been hit by the{E.E.C. milk quotas,}  
 the herd of 130 Friesians produce     
 670,000 litres per year instead of the
 750,000 litres the farmer,{Mr.Woolford
 would prefer.                         
 In addition to the dairy cattle there 
 are 100 heifers, 2 beef cows and a    
{Hereford polled bull}valued at current
 prices at Â£1000. In the winter the    
 cattle live in 9 cow houses, each     
 holding 42 cows, they are fed on hay  
 and silage grown on the{200 acres}of  
 cultivated grassland. The feeding is  
 computer controlled with{Â£130,000 of  
{equipment}used including heat         
 retrieving unit and automatic cluster 
 removal making the farm one of the    
 most up to date in the district.      
 Waste water from the milking parlour  
 is sprayed on to the fields to dilute 
 it and prevent pollution of streams.  </content>
