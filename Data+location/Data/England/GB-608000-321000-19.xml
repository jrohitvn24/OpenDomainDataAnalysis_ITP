		<title>19My Family And Pet's</title>
		<content> We used to live in Essex.When we moved
 to Reepham I was not sure whether I   
 would like living here.We used to have
 some cats but we have'nt got them now.
 We have got twentyfive fish and a     
 hampster called Poppy.She is a golden 
 colour and I like her alot.My grandma 
 has got a pet dog called Mandy and she
 is very good.My grandma live's just up
 the road from us.My mum is a Training 
 Officer at County Hall.My brother goes
 to Wymondham College which is a       
 bording school.We don't live very far 
 from the school so I don't have to    
 walk very far.We have got a climbing  
 frame in our back garden.I like going 
 swimming at the leisure centre and I  
 like going to the Brewery to have     
 lunch and a drink of Coca Cola.Then   
 come home and watch television.I also 
 like playing games.On friday's I play 
 basket ball.                          </content>
