		<title>19School Residential Trip</title>
		<content>Our class of 10 and 11 year old        
children at Sandhills School went      
to Poole for a five day trip in March  
1985. We used 2 minibuses to get       
there.On the way we stopped at Bucklers
Hard where big ships were made in the  
18th Century. We stayed at Canute House
on Poole Quay. We had a boat trip on   
the harbour, a trip to Corfe Castle and
Studland Beach, a visit to an aquarium 
and a look at the Georgian houses. We  
heard stories about smugglers.We walked
along the quay studying the boats etc. 
On the return journey we stopped at    
Salisbury Cathedral and climbed up the 
tower. Everyone had enjoyed the trip.  
At school we have made a book about    
our visit and we have made paintings,  
screen prints, lino cut prints, batiks,
scraper board pictures, sewn and woven 
pictures of boats, fish, Corfe, Old    
Harry Rocks, Georgian houses etc.      </content>
