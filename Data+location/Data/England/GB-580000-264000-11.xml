		<title>11Use of Bury St. Edmunds.</title>
		<content>Bury St. Edmunds town centre is within 
easy walking distance and we mainly use
it for shopping, especially on market  
days, Wednesday and Saturday. The main 
problem is parking and this is much    
worse on market days.                  
Our services such as hairdressing are  
usually in town and we might go down to
the library. There are museums to      
visit, a lot of restaurants including a
vegetarian one and an Indian one.      
If we go down to the Abbey Gardens we  
can play games, look at the monkeys,   
watch the ducks, picnic or just sit.   
Nearby is the Cathedral where people   
go to worship and we can take our      
visitors to admire the building.       
In the evening adults might go down    
town to the snooker club,the pubs or to
"Taps" disco.
