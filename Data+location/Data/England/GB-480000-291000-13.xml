		<content>  In this rural area fresh vegetables  
 and fruit can be obtained fairly      
 cheaply and stored in home freezers.  
 Many inhabitants grow at least some of
 their own produce. Goats milk, honey, 
 milk, cream and eggs can be purchased 
 locally. As natural gas is not        
 available, electricity or solid fuel  
 are the usual sources of power and    
 heat although bottled gas can be      
 obtained. Because of the closeness of 
 the communities help can usually be   
 obtained with transport of the        
 children for any activities but most  
 families own a car as the bus service 
 is non-existant in the evenings to any
 entertainment in the nearest towns.   
 The last count of family pets produced
 an average of one dog per household   
 plus a number of cats, ponies, ferrets
 and rabbits.
