      The Alverbank Hotel is the site  
 of a former brickworks,the access to  
 which was on the Stokes Bay Road.     
 Crossing the bridge over the River    
 Alver at low tide you can still see   
 some supports of the pier belonging to
 the brickworks. From here bricks were 
 shipped and coal landed in the l820's.
      Behind the course of the old moat
 are parts of the ramparts and in some 
 gardens you can see evidence of narrow
 entrenchments, dug for the defence of 
 this part of the coast.               
      On the right side of Jellicoe    
 Avenue there is still a high stone    
 wall. This formed the boundary of     
 Alvercliff house,a former residence of
 the Commander of the Royal            
 Engineers.The house was built on the  
 site of the Stokes Bay Battery no2    
 Redoubt.                              </content>
