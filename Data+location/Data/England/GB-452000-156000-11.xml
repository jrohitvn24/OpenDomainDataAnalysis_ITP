		<title>11KINGSCLERE LIME QUARRY</title>
		<content>  Kingsclere Lime Quarry was started by
 the Romans almost 2,000 years ago. It 
 covers 7 acres. It has been owned by  
 the Futcher family for over 30 years. 
 There are two workmen employed there, 
 and six lorries to carry the lime     
 away. There is a weigh-bridge which is
 8 metres long and 4 metres wide to    
 weigh the lorries before they go on   
 the road. Every day they take out     
 between 20 and 50 tons of chalk       
 depending on the demand. The chalk is 
 stored in sheds so that it does not   
 get damp. Sometimes they burn the     
 chalk to make lime. It is used for    
 spreading on fields. Special lorries  
 carry it and grind it up so that it is
 fine enough to spread. It is a        
 fertilizer to make the grass grow well
