		<title>15THE RECTOR OF WADDINGTON</title>
		<content>   In February 1982 I was inducted as  
 Rector and received with great warmth 
 and friendliness and two hour peel of 
 bells. One of the earliest excitements
 was the view, from Waddington 'Cliff',
 over the Trent Valley with the massive
 power stations a constant reminder    
 that in the 1970s every village in the
 land had become 'urban'. Farming and  
 employment has changed radically and  
 patterns of behaviour have been       
 offered to us in bewildering          
 profusion. People here, as elsewhere, 
 are less ready to respond to direct   
 instruction and more ready to respond 
 to learn through questioning and      
 experiencing. Hence the development of
 church house groups and a more        
 informal style of meeting and worship.
 There is a shift from passivity under 
 authority to expectations of          
 collaboration and sharing.            </content>
