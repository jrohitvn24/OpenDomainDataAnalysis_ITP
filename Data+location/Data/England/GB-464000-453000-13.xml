		<title>13STOCKTON HALL</title>
		<content> Stockton Hall was built about 200     
 years ago.It has about 23 acres of    
 land.It became a Boy's School in 1965.
    The boys are mostly those who have 
 been in trouble with the law, but     
 there are some whose parents have not 
 looked after them very well and there 
 are a few with no parents at all.The  
 school has 76 boys, of which 12 come  
 into school from York each day.       
     The boys do not study for any     
 exams,but they do take courses in     
 Maths, English, P.E.,and Social       
 Studies.The ages of the boys vary     
 between 12 and 17.                    
      They can have visitors but they  
 must be in bed by 10 p.m.They have    
 plenty of games such as               
 canoeing,climbing,shooting,motor      
 cycling, basketball,cycling and       
 archery.In 10 years they are hoping to
 have girls at the school as well.     </content>
