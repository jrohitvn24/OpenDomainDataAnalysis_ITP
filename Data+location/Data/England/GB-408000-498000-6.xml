		<title>06ENTERTAINMENT IN MARSKE AREA</title>
		<content> There is very little going on in the  
 way of entertainment. Dances, Domino  
 drives and Whist drives are held in   
 Marske Village Hall, four or five     
 times a year. Reeth Young Farmers Club
 also uses the Hall for Discoes. The   
 Church holds a Harvest Supper in      
 October, and the Women's Institute    
 have a Carol Service at Christmas.    
 Also at Christmas there is a Party for
 the children and Senior citizens. Some
 people occasionally visit the Georgian
 Theatre in Richmond and travel to     
 Newcastle, the nearest place at which 
 to see Shakespeare plays performed.   
 Almost every house has a television   
 set.
