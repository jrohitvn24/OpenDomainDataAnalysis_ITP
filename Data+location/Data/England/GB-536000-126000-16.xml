		<title>16The Bluebell Railway</title>
		<content>    The Bluebell Railway runs for five 
 miles between the stations at  Horsted
 Keynes and Sheffield Park. The line   
 was first opened in 1882, but B.R.    
 closed it in 1958 because it was not  
 used much. It was reopened as the     
 Bluebell line in the 1960s to keep old
 steam trains running. It now carries  
 nearly 100 000 passengers a year. They
 come to see the engines and visit the 
 stations and to travel through the    
 beautiful countryside near our        
 village.                              
    Children from our school sometimes 
 visit the railway and some of them    
 made a television film there. Lots of 
 films are made on the famous Bluebell 
 Railway. I like the railway because I 
 like the old trains, and the way the  
 sun glitters and reflects off the     
 metal engines. They are very old but  
 they look new and shiney.             </content>
