		<content>  There are only two places of worship,
 both Church of England churches. The  
 older of the two, and the more        
 interesting is Curcham, which is set  
 on the top of a small hill and has an 
 unusual helm spire, one of only two   
 in the country. It was built by       
 William de Rue, Lord of the Manor, as 
 a reparation to Gloucester Abbey      
 because his men had molested the      
 monks. At the time when Gilbert Scott 
 was redesigning churches, Churcham was
 spared by the Vicar who merely        
 restored the building. All the timbers
 are joined with wooden pegs; there is 
 said not to be a single nail used in  
 its construction. Minsterworth did not
 escape the zeal of the Victorians. It 
 is nevertheless a pleasant church with
 a square tower. An interesting feature
 inside is a carved net of fish on one 
 of the pillars.                       </content>
