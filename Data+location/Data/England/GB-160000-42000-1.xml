		<title>01Introduction to area.</title>
		<content> Much of this area is sea.  It is a    
 popular place for the tourists and    
 local walkers.  The coastal footpath  
 takes you along cliffs that are       
 treacherous with some small caves     
 which can be reached from above.      
  The Red River runs through part of   
 the area and there is some woodland,  
 though most of the land is bleak and  
 windswept in winter.                  
  Coombe Valley is a beautiful place in
 which most of the residents of this   
 area live.  Here there is a           
 residential caraven site.             
  The main industry is farming and     
 there are some old quarries.  There is
 also a caravan and campsite.  Pat of  
 the area is owned by the National     
 Trust.
