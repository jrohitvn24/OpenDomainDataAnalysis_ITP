		<content>  Most people rode their bikes in their
 spare time and they rode them often.  
 Also most people enjoyed reading      
 books. 5 people did both.             
  There were 4 people who watched      
 television. 4 people played with      
 another person. We expected that a lot
 more people would watch television and
 that less people would play with      
 another person in their spare time.   
  2 people played football. We expected
 that there would be more.             
  There were 2 people who swam and 2   
 people who played on their computer.  
  These are the things only 1 person   
 did:                                  
   walking dogs, playing cricket,      
 canoeing, Brownies, playing the piano,
 bird watching, fishing, drawing, and  
 colouring.
