		<content>{Over the moon and under the stars}is a
 skipping game in which we have a long 
 rope and jump over and under it.      
{Elastic}needs three or four people:   
 two stand in and the others stand out 
 and jump in and on the elastic. Lots  
 of rules are made for the game.       
{Sevenses}is a ball game in which you  
 throw a ball in all different ways. If
 you drop it you are out.{Hot Rice}is a
 game which you can play with a lot of 
 people. One child is "on" and that    
 child has a ball. All of the other    
 children go off and the child that has
 got the ball has to throw the ball at 
 one of the other children. If it      
 touches you, you are out. When the    
 thrower has got all of the children   
 then the first child that was caught  
 is on and you start again.
