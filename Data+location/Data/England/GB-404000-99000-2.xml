		<content> Road and pavement surfaces are often  
 being worked on since the town centre 
 undergoes frequent improvements.      
{Housing}ranges from small bungalows   
 to large houses. Standards of housing 
 are high and there are no high-rise   
 blocks of flats. Many different types 
 of housing are going to be completed  
 during the next decade - in the region
 of 500-1000.                          
 There is strong competition between   
 shops and many of similar type, eg.   
 four large supermarkets and several   
 hair salons, are contained in a small 
 area.{Tesco,}owners of the most recent
 addition to Ferndown's supermarkets,  
 have given Â£1/2 million towards the   
 new community centre, which is being  
 built as part of the new town centre  
 development.                          
 There are good{public services        
 including Fire, Police and Library.   </content>
