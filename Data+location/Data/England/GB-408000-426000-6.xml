		<content> The small fields are separated by dry 
 stone walls, which have weathered     
 black and are covered with moss and   
 lichen. In the fields there are lots  
 of uncultivated grasses such as       
 Yorkshire Fog. There are many wild    
 flowers in the fields including       
 buttercups, cow parsley, vetch,       
 daisies and dandelions. There are some
 small hedges growing along the edges  
 of the fields and are made up of small
 trees and bushes, the most common     
 being holly, hawthorn,elderberry and  
 dog roses. There also many flowers in 
 these hedges, and large clumps of     
 nettles which are the plant food for  
 the caterpillars of such butterflies  
 as the Small Tortoiseshell and Red    
 Admiral. The trees are deciduous and  
 include all the common varieties. The 
 Elm is just starting to be affected by
 Dutch Elm disease.                    </content>
