   Approximately 90% of the study area 
 is taken up by agricultural land.Most 
 of this land is owned by the 15 farms 
 marked on the map of the study area.  
 Naturally there is also farmland owned
 by farms outside the study area.This  
 was particularly evident in the       
 village of Thorpe Audlin where only   
 one of the four farms marked on the   
 map still has a large area of         
 farmland.Two of the others are now    
 only small-holdings and the last is a 
 private house,the land having been    
 sold to farmers outside the study     
 area.                                 
   About 85% of the farmland is arable 
 land,the rest being under             
 grass.However,there is quite a variety
 of farming types in the area.Most of  
 the farms do keep livestock mainly    </content>
