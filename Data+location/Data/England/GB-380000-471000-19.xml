		<title>19Horton Local History Group</title>
		<content> One of the aims of the group is to try
 and find information about Horton's   
 past and record it for the future.    
 This information is kept in the       
 school.                               
                                       
 A book on Horton's history has been   
 produced.  An exhibition of documents,
 old photographs and farm implements   
 was held in the church.               
                                       
 Information from old wills, registers 
 and gravestones has been used to make 
 family trees.  The Foster family can  
 be traced back 400 years. Older people
 have been interviewed and memories    
 tape-recorded.  The group took part in
 the SPAB Barn Survey.                 
                                       
 Members of the group have helped the  
 Junior Class of Horton School to carry
 out this Domesday Project.            </content>
