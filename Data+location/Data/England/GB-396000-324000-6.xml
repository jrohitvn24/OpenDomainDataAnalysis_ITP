		<title>06  INGESTRE HALL:THE HISTORY</title>
		<content> Ingestre Hall was mentioned in the    
original Domesday Survey in 1086 as a  
Norman Manor House.However today,there 
is little remaining of the original    
building.                              
In 1613 the building was pulled down   
by Sir Walter Chetwynd and the present 
Jacobean rose-brick manor was erected  
in its place.                          
In later years the architect John Nash 
made alterations to the Jacobean South 
Front.However,a fire in 1882 damaged   
the building and it took 3 years to re 
-build it.The architect,Birch,tried to 
re-produce the original building using 
the old bricks and only changed the    
entrance at the request of the         
twentieth Earl of Shrewsbury.          
Recently,restoration work to the roof  
and stonework decoration has been      
completed,to preserve local history..
