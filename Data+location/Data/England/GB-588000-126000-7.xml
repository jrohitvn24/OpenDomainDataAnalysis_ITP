		<content>{ Newbridge Farm}is a Marsh Sheep Farm 
 owned by Mr. Dickinson.  We saw some  
 chickens and ducks and his 3 dogs     
 called Ben, Rusty and Tramp.  Mr.     
 Dickinson has 650 ewes and we went    
 through a barn and saw some orphan    
 lambs and in the hay we saw a rat     
 stealing some sheep food.  Near the   
 river there is a shepherd's hut which 
 is about 200 years old and which is   
 now used to store tools.  As it is a  
 Marsh farm it is about 50 years old   
 and was previously under the sea.     
{ Blackbarn Farm}is 10 acres and they  
 use tractors, drotts and bailers.     
 There are cows, donkeys and sheep     
 making 60 animals in all which are fed
 twice a day.  We tried out the        
 electric fence and found it was on -  
 it made us jump!  We made the giant   
 mouse wheel turn by walking on it,    
 (this is really a cattle feeder).     </content>
