		<title>14Events in Little Sodbury.</title>
		<content> There are not many events in the      
 Little Sodbury area.But the residents 
 do join up with Horton for a fun run  
 which takes place in May,a bonfire    
 night which is in November,and their  
 fete which is in March.They also hold 
 a barn-dance in April.In the evenings 
 they may watch television and         
 sometimes they will go out in their   
 cars.Sometimes people go in the fields
 to play cricket.On some evenings they 
 will stay in and play cards and board 
 games.At Christmas time most people   
 stay at home and entertain their      
 family.Some peolpe also stay at home  
 and do gardening,and some people go on
 long walks.It is a quiet village and  
 there are not many organised clubs and
 societes.Not very many people live in 
 the area.
