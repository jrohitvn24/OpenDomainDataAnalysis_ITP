		<title>20LOCAL CELEBRITIES</title>
		<content> The Sunninghill/Sunningdale area is   
 quite famous for the number of famous 
 people that decide to make their homes
 here.Richard Starkey better known as  
 Ringo Starr of the now defunct Beatles
 lives on the edge of our Domesday     
 area.Until last year when they died in
 seperate but tragic circumstances the 
 famous British Actress Diana Dors and 
 her husband were prominant figures in 
 the community.Bruce Forsyth's name is 
 often linked with the area due to his 
 love of golf and the same can be said 
 of Jimmy Tarbuck.Richard O'Sullivan   
 has lived here for many years.The     
 reasons behind this high concentration
 of celebrities must be the affluence  
 of the area,the proximity to Royal    
 Ascot and Wentworth/Sunningdale Golf  
 Courses and its proximity to London.  
 Whatever the reason it gives the area 
 a certain flavour not found elsewhere.</content>
