		<title>14The Princetown Railway.</title>
		<content> On the left hand side of our 'D' block
 is an old overgrown railway track.It  
 is called the{Princetown Railway.}Some
 of the engines are being restored so  
 that they can once more run along the 
 line.For 6 pence,in old               
 money,passengers could go to the      
 centre of{Plymouth}up to the 196O's.  
 The train that went into Plymouth was 
 nick-named the 'Woolworth Special',it}
 would take from half to three quarters
 of an hour to go from{Shaugh Halt}into
 town by the steam engine.It worked    
 seven days a week,Saturday &amp; Sunday   
 being the most popular days for people
 to ride on it.On average it carried   
 about 60 people.One day some          
 enthusiasts may bring it back(I hope  
 so!).
