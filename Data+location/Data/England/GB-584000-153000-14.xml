		<content>     There is very little employment in
 the village itself and most people    
 have to travel to the nearest towns   
 for work. The main source of          
 employment in the area is on the many 
 farms that cover our D-block, there   
 are a few shops in the village and    
 there is also a car and machinery     
 repair yard near the station. Some    
 people commute to London each day from
 the village and the school employs six
 local people as helpers.              
     There is little new work or       
 housing in the village and so the     
 population remains quite stable and   
 young people are finding it           
 increasingly difficult to find work.  
 There is already some unemployment in 
 the village and people have to be     
 prepared to travel further afield to  
 find jobs.                            
                                       </content>
