		<title>11Totternhoe Village</title>
		<content> Totternhoe is a small village to the  
 South-West of Dunstable.  It has a    
 mixture of council and private houses.
 Some people work locally, others      
 commute to London or Milton Keynes.   
 There is an old church, called St.    
 Giles and there is a Methodist Chapel.
 We have three pubs, two by the school 
 and one by the Knolls.  There is a    
 Recreation Ground which is used by the
 Football Club.  The Rec. also has     
 swings for the children.  There is a  
 shop and Post Office, though most     
 shopping is done in Dunstable or      
 Luton.  The village has cub, scout,   
 brownie and guide groups.  The W. I.  
 and the Keep Fit groups meet in the   
 school.  This is a Lower School and   
 caters for children from 5 to 9 years.
 The nearest Middle and Upper schools  
 are in Dunstable.  The Aylesbury to   
 Luton bus goes through Totternhoe.    </content>
