		<title>14THE A5 AT NESSCLIFFE</title>
		<content> The A5 in one way is a pain because I 
 can't play with my friends on the     
 Crescent because Mum has to cross me  
 over and sometimes she is too busy.   
 In the early morning there is not much
 traffic except for in the summer when 
 people are going away on holiday.     
 When it rains I get splashed by the   
 fast cars and lorries.  The pubs are  
 in the right places for people to get 
 a drink or meal and so is the garage  
 for getting petrol easily.  Lots of   
 people go too fast on the A5          
 sometimes they crash but it serves    
 them right for going too fast on the  
 slippery busy roads.  We counted      
 traffic on the A5 for 5 mins every 3  
 hrs on June lO.
