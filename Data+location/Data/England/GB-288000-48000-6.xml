		<content> Thundering around                     
 In a fierce mood                      
 Keep back! Keep back!                 
 He's hungry today.                    
 Crashing,tumbling,                    
 In and out of the rocks.              
                                       
 Calm again, reaching out              
 A friendly hand to children.          
 But be careful!                       
 Further out he kicks his legs,        
 He's the giant of the sea.            
                                       
 His hair is the seaweed               
 Where the crabs do play.              
 The rocks are good company today.     
 The fishes swimming round his toes,   
 Oh how happy is he now,               
 The giant of the sea.
