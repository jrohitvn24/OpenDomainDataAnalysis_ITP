		<title>14HOUSING IN CASTLE CARROCK</title>
		<content>     Most of the 84 houses in central  
 CASTLE CARROCK were built in the 18th 
 and 19th centuries.   Sandstone was   
 quarried locally and slate was brought
 from the Lake District.               
     Along the main road leading to    
 Carlisle are several typical inter-war
 semi-detached houses; while on the    
 minor road leading to the fells are 5 
 detached bungalows built in the 1960s.
   Since then the only changes have    
 been the erection of 3 new detached   
 in-fill properties, the conversion of 
 3 old barns, courtyard buildings and a
 wing of Gelt Hall into modern houses  
 and flats.                            
     Although all 84 properties are    
 occupied, two are "second homes".     
 Most properties are owner-occupied,   
 and even most of the few Council      
 houses have been bought by their      
 tenants.                              </content>
