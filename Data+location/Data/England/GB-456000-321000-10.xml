		<content>    Some interesting aspects of how    
 wild plants have adapted to man's     
 interference: normally found near the 
 coast, a salt-loving mushroom         
{"Agaricus Bernedii"}has been thriving 
 along the grass verges in the autumn  
 and winter months (the salting of     
 roads in winter has caused this to    
 happen). Another salt lover from the  
 east coast, a rare lily{"Star of      
{Bethlehem"}was also found on the grass
 verge. It thrived for two years until 
 a well meaning council flail-mower    
 shortened its height and its life!    
    Certain garden plants have found a 
 new lease of life by being dumped     
 along local lanes, including{Aconite, 
{Michaelmas Daisy, Daffodil, Narcissus,
{Pansy, Violet, Snowdrop, Golden Rod,  
{Rape, Berberis &amp; Forget-Me-Not.
