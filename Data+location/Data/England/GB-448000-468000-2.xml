 At the time of the                    
 survey-June/July,the preoccupation of 
 most farmers was haymaking.Few of the 
 farms were purely arable so that often
 early morning was spent feeding and   
 checking stock while fields dried.The 
 later morning might be spent turning  
 the hay ready for baling or greasing  
 and maintaining machinery.Several     
 older workers remembered haymaking by 
 hand and one specified the date of the
 first tractor he had seen-an          
 International in 1921.For the         
 afternoon and evening the farmers     
 tried to cut or bale as much as they  
 could-some talked of working til      
 10p.m.in good weather.They ensured all
 bales were covered with sheets before 
 finishing.
