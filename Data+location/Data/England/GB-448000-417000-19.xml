		<content>    The area provides very good        
 facilities for people requiring meals 
 and accommodation or rooms for        
 meetings, receptions etc. As we could 
 not give a full picture of Darrington,
 we looked closely at Wentbridge.      
    Wentbridge House has 20 bedrooms, 2
 restaurants, one of which may be used 
 for private parties, and the Crystal  
 Suite which can provide conference and
 banqueting facilities for up to 120   
 people. The manager thought the       
 setting of the village was a big      
 attraction, as well as the Hotel's    
 position near the A1.                 
   The Swiss Cottage is a large        
 restaurant with a Carvery. It is      
 popular for parties from the districts
 around. We sampled the menu! (Page18) 
    The Blue Bell Inn is the oldest on 
 the A1. It is popular for lunches.    
    There is a cafe and 2 Bed &amp; B.house</content>
