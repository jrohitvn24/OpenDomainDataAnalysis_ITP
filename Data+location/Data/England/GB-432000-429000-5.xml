		<title>05How the Sewage Works</title>
		<content>                                       
      Conditions in the growing town of
{Leeds}in the early 19th century were  
 unbelievably bad by modern standards. 
 The same area, according to one       
 contemporary observer, had only two   
 simple{privies}to serve 380 people.   
      Now we can expect better         
 treatment! For the benefit of the     
 "flush and forget" fraternity, this is
 what happens: (1) raw sewage enters   
{Knostrop}works; (2) it is filtered to 
 separate wood, rags and grit; (3)     
 suspended solids are settled out in a 
 primary tank; (4) effluent is passed  
 through a biological filter process:  
 naturally formed microbes destroy     
{bacteria;}(5) effluent is held in a   
 final settlement tank before being    
 discharged into the river.
