		<content>  Sidmouth's narrow valley setting has 
 greatly influenced its growth. The    
 small historic settlements at{Sidford 
 and{Sidbury}are now almost continuous 
 of the main settlement, since growth  
 has occurred along the main valley    
 floor of the Sid.                     
  Sidmouth and its adjoining           
 settlements in the Sid Valley have an 
 outstanding heritage of historic      
 buildings. There are 484 buildings now
 listed as of special architectural and
 historic interest in the area. Most   
 are on the statutory list and only 55 
 are recorded as of merely local       
 interest. A measure of the            
 significance of Sidmouth's historic   
 buildings is that as many as 22       
 buildings are noted as worthy of Grade
 II status; these are buildings of     
 particular importance.
