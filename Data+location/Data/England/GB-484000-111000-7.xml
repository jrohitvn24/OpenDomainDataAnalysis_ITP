 Surrounding West Dean College are the 
 Edwardian-style country-house gardens.
 Walking through them,you could almost 
 be back in the nineteenth-century.The 
 gardens are full of beautiful flowers 
 and shrubs,and also some rare trees.  
   The Garden is open to the Public and
 always has an abundance of visitors.  
 The first garden was created in 1622, 
 and after the adding of several large 
 lawns,now occupies an area of thirty- 
 five acres.                           
   The Orangery is a fine conservatory,
 which was built by James Wyatt.       
 Nowadays,it is used as a refreshment  
 area.                                 
   The Walled Garden was built in 1810,
 replacing a smaller kitchen garden.It 
 houses a lawnmower collection,dating  
 back to the 1850's.There is also a    
 garden exhibition,dating back to 1623.</content>
