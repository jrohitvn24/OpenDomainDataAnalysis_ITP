		<title>16In Case of Fire - Darwen</title>
		<content>  Fire services are provided by Darwen 
 Fire Station which has two appliances,
 one full-time and one part-time.      
  There is a standard response to all  
 calls and two appliances would attend 
 a factory fire, even to Crown Paints  
 where many highly inflammable         
 materials are used. The officer in    
 charge assesses the requirement and   
 sends for extra help if required.     
  Reinforcements would be called from  
 around the area and the order of      
 request would be similar to:          
  Blackburn force, Oswaldtwistle,      
 Accrington, Great Harwood, Chorley,   
 Burnley, Padiham and further afield in
 a widening circle.                    
  There are at least 7 fires each week 
 in the Darwen area. Recently, there   
 have been 4 injuries - two serious    
 burns, a serious leg and a            
 serious head injury.                  </content>
