		<title>18SUGAR BEET RESEARCH STATION</title>
		<content> It took a short time to get to Bush   
 Johnson's research station.It is a    
 large laboratory where experiments are
 done on sugar beet to improve its     
 quality and quantity.On arrival we    
 went to the secretary's office who    
 telephoned for the boss.We went to a  
 room and asked questions.After that we
 had drinks and biscuits and then we   
 were shown the sugar beet.In the      
 various greenhouses we saw sugar beet 
 growing at different stages.Half the  
 sugar we eat is produced from beet and
 the rest is sugar cane.We had a look  
 at the Company's computer room before 
 we went back to school.               
    The name of the Company comes from 
 a Polish gentleman called Bushinski   
 who originally owned the laboratories.
 It was shortened to Bush and Johnson  
 was added to make it sound more       
 English.                              </content>
