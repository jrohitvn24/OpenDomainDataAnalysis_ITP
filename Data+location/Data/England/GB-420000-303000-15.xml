		<title>15 The Town Hall.</title>
		<content>                                       
 The {Town Hall} was built in 1735 by  
Thomas Guy. There are six rooms, four  
large and two small. There is a large  
room which used to be used for Council 
meetings. The Mayor's Parlour is a     
comfortable smaller room. It contains  
the Mayor's robes and a cabinet full of
silver and glassware which has been    
given to Tamworth over the years.      
 The Mayor's {chain} is very heavy and 
is worth thirty thousand pounds. The   
present Mayor, Mr. Munn is a builder   
by profession. In July the Mayor of    
Tamworth in Australia is visiting the  
town. Although the Council now meets   
at Marmion House the Town Hall is still
used by groups every week. The arches  
under the main room was the site of the
old butter market.
