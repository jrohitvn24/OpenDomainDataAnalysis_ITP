		<title>11My hobbies by Craig Nevins</title>
		<content> On a Monday, Tuesday and a Friday     
 after school I go to band practice.   
 Other times I go to the baths         
 or play bowls. When it is raining I   
 usually watch T.V. or play games.     
 Sometimes on Tuesdays, Thursdays,     
 Saturdays and Sundays I go  out       
 jogging round Consett.Sometimes my Dad
 takes me to play golf at{Beggars Wood 
{Recreation Park.}Other times I have a 
 game of putt. My favourite kind of    
 golf is crazy golf. Sometimes I get a 
 book from the library. My favourite   
 thing is drawing. I mainly  draw Walt 
 Disney characters and other cartoon   
 characters like Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck
 and Tom and Jerry. Sometimes I just do
 patterns on squared paper. I also like
 playing football, snooker and pool.I  
 also like looking after lizards and   
 snakes.
