		<content>In our area there is only one school.  
                                       
 his St.Kenelm's Church of England     
Primary (Controlled) School. There are 
105 children on roll and four          
teachers,including the Headteacher. The
school was founded in 1872 but was     
rebuilt in 1968.                       
There are other signs of schools in our
area but these have now closed down. In
Minster Lovell itself there are two old
school buildings and we spotted another
at Asthall.                            
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
