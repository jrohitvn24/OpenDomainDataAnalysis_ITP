 public in 1913 just before the First  
 World War.Some of the trees were      
 planted for the Queens jubilee.All the
 parts of the park are open to the     
 public,such as the swings, slides,    
 tennis courts, bowling greens,cricket 
 and football pitches ,and also a      
 hockey pitch. You can see all the     
 Channel Islands, such as Jethou,      
 Jersey, Sark, Herm, Alderney and      
 France on a fine day. There are four  
 public toilets, and four German       
 bunkers remaining from the Occupation.
 St.Sampson's school use the park      
 everyday, as do clubs from England and
 local clubs for various activities.   
 There are 16 seats to sit on and two  
 park keepers are employed. Delancey   
 Park is the biggest park in           
 Guernsey,with a monument in the       
 middle.                               </content>
