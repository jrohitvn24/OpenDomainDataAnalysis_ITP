		<title>14CHRIST'S COLLEGE</title>
		<content> The tower of Christ's College with its
 green copper roof is perhaps          
 Finchley's best known landmark. The   
 date 1860 and "E.R.", the initials of 
 the architect, Edward Roberts, appear 
 high on the south-west face of the    
 building. A distinctive feature is the
 pattern of Tudor-style diaper         
 decoration in blue-black bricks.      
 The original school was founded in    
 1857 by the then rector of St.Mary's  
 church Rev.White, in Church House at  
 the end of the churchyard.This        
 building had previously been let as   
 the Queen's Head Pub.                 
 The school soon became very succesful 
 and popular that it was forced to move
 to its present site opposite the      
 church.                               
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
