		<content>    Our square contains the River Stour
 which takes up about a third of the   
 square.                               
    The main place is {Mistley}which is
 a small village and there are about   
 3,500 people living there. The main   
{industries}are the quay and the       
 maltings .Mistley quay is an old quay 
 and it has been there for hundreds of 
 years. Mistley is famous for its swans
 which eat grain from the{maltings.}   
    The rest of our square contains    
 farmland. There are about 5 farms and 
 the crops they grow are wheat, barley 
 and rape. Some of the farms keep      
 a few beef cattle.                    
    There is one railway linked to     
 Colchester and London.
