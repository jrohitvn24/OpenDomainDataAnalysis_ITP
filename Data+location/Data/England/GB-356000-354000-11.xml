		<title>11COMMUNITY SPIRIT IN HAUGHTON</title>
		<content> _______________________________       
 Haughton is a small close-knit        
 community where everyone knows        
 everyone else and their occupation,   
 and where help is freely given when   
 needed.                               
 There are few services in the locality
 with public transport being very      
 limited. People with cars help by     
 giving lifts to those without         
 transport if they need to keep dental 
 or hospital appointments, to visit    
 friends or go shopping. During the    
 eighties the village school and the   
 chapel have both closed despite       
 protests and campaigns to keep        
 them open. Falling attendance and     
 financial constraints were given as   
 reasons. Both buildings are now houses
 so two social centres have been lost. 
 The children are bussed daily to      
 schools in larger villages.           </content>
