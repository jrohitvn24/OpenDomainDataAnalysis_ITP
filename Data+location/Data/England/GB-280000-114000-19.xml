		<content> Some of the cottages in Witheridge are
 over three hundred years old and quite
 a few were burnt down early this      
 century. Just off the square, where a 
 market used to be held,is one of the  
 largest areas of this type of         
 cottage. They have thatched roofs,    
 cob walls and there are lots of       
 narrow alleyways between the          
 cottages and in some places the       
 original cobblestones are to be       
 seen. Because of the cost of          
 re_thatching a number of people have  
 wanted to replace the thatch with     
 slates but have not been allowed to   
 do so because it is now a listed      
 area. There are a number of Footpaths 
 in the area which tend to link up with
 the outlying farms,but there are no   
 bridle paths and this causes problems 
 between riders and walkers,
