		<title>02A Church In Felixstowe</title>
		<content>    The church of St Peter and Paul is 
 the {oldest building}in Felixstowe. In
 about{1100}Roger Bigod built a        
 Benedictine Priory here dedicated to  
 St Felix. Many bits have been added   
 since the 14th century.               
    Before the reformation the church  
 was full of colour and wealth, but in 
 the 16th &amp; 17th centuries the interior
 was altered according to the new      
 beliefs. Early in the 19th century the
 church was left neglected. The second 
 half of the 19th century saw dramatic 
 changes in both church and village.   
 This was because Felixstowe became    
 fashionable as a watering place and   
 there was an interest in the          
 restoration of churches.              
    The church is made of{septaria}a   
 local building material. It's total   
 length is 126 feet.
