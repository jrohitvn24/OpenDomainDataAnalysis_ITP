		<title>09WETHERBY PLANNING OFFICER</title>
		<content>  The Planning Officer said that he    
 needed a Diploma in Town Planning to  
 get his job. He had been a planner for
 twenty years and said he enjoyed the  
 job because it was so varied. In 1981 
 322 houses were given planning consent
 and about 833 more are expected by    
 1991. At the{Hill Top Farm}development
 shops may be built, but evidence shows
 people prefer supermarkets. He said no
 new industries are planned because the
 new population will probably work out 
 of Wetherby. The population in 1931   
 was 2774, 4179 in 1961, 7332 in 1971, 
 9725 in 1981 and by 1991 it is        
 expected to increase to about 12000.  
  All sorts of different people work in
 the Planning Office, including        
 draughtsmen, administrators, enforcers
 environmental officers and, of course,
 planning officers (who mainly deal    
 with development control).            </content>
