In the winter the boys play football   
and the girls play netball. We all     
play  rounders and do athletics in the 
summer. Swimming is done all the year  
round .We swim every Friday at Daventry
but some people stay behind because    
they are ill. We play rounders in games
time on Wednesday after our playtime   
and sometimes we also do athletics in  
games lessons. In swimming we do       
different stages and levels. A team    
has been to Derby and Duston for       
swimming galas.We have been to Long    
Buckby for athletic sports ,and badges 
can be won .At Football the boys won   
against Yelvertoft 3-1 ,but the girls  
lost at Netball 10-0. Yelvertoft beat  
us at football later 6-5.Each year we  
have a School Sports day.This year it  
is on  9th July.We have flat races,    
obstacle races and novelty races.      </content>
