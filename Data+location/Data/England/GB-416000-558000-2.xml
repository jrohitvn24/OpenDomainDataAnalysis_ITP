		<content> My name is Julian Metcalfe. My age is 
 11.I live at Catton Grove,            
  Sunniside, Newcastle- upon_Tyne.In   
 the morning  I got up and got dressed 
 for School,had a wash and went down   
 for breakfast.Then I went to School   
 with my friend John Tate.We played    
 football when we got to School,then we
 went into School.My School is called  
 Clover Hill and there is about 220    
 children go to it.When I got to School
 I met my friends and teachers,Mr      
 Pearson and Mr Bell.We did maths first
 then after play we did language work. 
    We had our lunch,then we had       
 playtime.We then had science in which 
 we observed a goldfish and recorded   
 our findings in our books.Then it was 
 playtime in which I played football.
