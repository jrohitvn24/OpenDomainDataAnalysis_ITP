		<content> In Head Quarters there is a British   
 Commander who makes sure that British 
 regulations are observed. One of the  
 four world-wide Red Horse groups is   
 stationed at the base. These units    
 specialise in runway repair and they  
 are all-round constructors who put up 
 bridges and erect fences, they also   
 build buildings and many other things.
 There is an all-British fire brigade, 
 and a police force that is mainly     
 British with a few Americans. There is
 one runway which is controlled by the 
 only hand operated control tower left 
 over from the 2nd World War. The tower
 receives the up to date weather       
 forecast.
