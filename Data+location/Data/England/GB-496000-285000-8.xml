		<title>08LEISURE IN LYVEDEN 1</title>
		<content>  Lyveden, being a rural area with only
 six houses is very limited, activities
 wise.After speaking to some people at 
 Lyveden,we found that the main leisure
 pursuits are pheasant shooting, bird  
 and deer watching. There is some      
 fox-hunting.                          
                                       
{PHEASANT SHOOTING                     
  Pheasant shooting is held once every 
 year and this lasts about a week or   
 so. The shoots are held and organised 
 by the Duke of Gloucester's estate.The
 shoot is open to those who can afford 
 to take part.The local people either  
 spectate or act as beaters.           
                                       
{BIRD WATCHING                         
  Bird watching is a more popular      
 hobby, on which tourists often come to
 spend a day  with their binoculars and
 flasks.                               </content>
