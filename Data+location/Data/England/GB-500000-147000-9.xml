		<content>{Tourism.}There are many hotels and    
 public houses in Guildford. These     
 cater for tourists who visit the area 
 to see the castle and the museum. An  
 example is the Clavadel Hotel.        
 Business is especially good in the    
 summer when plenty of foreigners are  
 around. The locals also use the hotel 
 bar.                                  
                                       
{The Supernatural.}At the Percy Arms in
 Chilworth, a poltergeist called George
 pushed people out of bed and knocked  
 at doors. Originally the inn was used 
 as a mortuary for the gunpowder works.
 It is probable that George was a      
 victim. There is also a ghost at      
 Postford House. A murdered body was   
 hidden behind the panelling of the    
 drawing room in the eighteenth        
 century. Footsteps have been heard at 
 night.                                </content>
