		<content>   Mr. Bainbridge breeds all his own   
 stock.He keeps 5 bulls,4 beef and 1   
 dairy for replacement stock.They aim  
 to get one calf per year from each    
 cow.Each lactation lasts about 300    
 days then she is put into calf again. 
   The fields are dressed with high    
 nitrogen fertilisers to make the grass
 grow well.It is cut and led to the    
 cows during the summer.In winter the  
 main food is silage which is made     
 from grass in the early summer. It is 
 put in pits and cured. Cows are given 
 concentrates according to the amount  
 of milk they give. Each cow wears a   
 transponder which contains an         
 electronic signal, this is linked to a
 computer which allocates the correct  
 ammount of food to each cow.          
   Mr. Bainbridge also grows about 40  
 acres of barley which is also used for
 feeding.                              </content>
