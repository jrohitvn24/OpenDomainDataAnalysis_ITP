		<title>19A survey of Parents' Jobs .</title>
		<content>  We asked all the pupils at school    
where their parents worked and these   
are our findings .Most dads work on    
farms then the next most popular type  
of work is in factories .Most Mums     
work, only about a third do not go out 
to work.Mums mostly work as cleaners in
local houses or the Rose and Crown     
Hotel.When we asked how far Dads       
travelled to work we found that 10 out 
of 25 work within a mile of Ashbury .  
5 Dads travel about 9 miles to Swindon 
and 4 work in Lambourn ,6 miles away.  
Two Dads travel very far  one travels  
to Winchester and the other to Stanlake
in southern England .It is interesting 
that we have one race horse trainer as 
a parent .                             
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
