		<title>13LYCEUM THEATRE GHOSTS:3</title>
		<content> actually came to haunt the theatre,   
 but I have heard it said that he used 
 to haunt an old pub which was situated
 near the Lyceum.  When the pub was    
 demolished he had to move somewhere   
 else, so he came to the obvious place,
 which is the Lyceum theatre.          
    Whether these paranormal tales are 
 true I do not know, since I have to   
 see something to believe in it.       
 Nonetheless, I still hope that they { 
{are}true because it adds to the appeal
 and mystery of this old building.
