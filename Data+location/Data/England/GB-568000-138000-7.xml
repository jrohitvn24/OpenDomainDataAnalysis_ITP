Horsmonden School from the age of five 
until they are eleven.  Some choose to 
go to Brenchley, Goudhurst or private  
schools.  The school day begins at nine
a.m. and ends at three-fifteen.  There 
is a break for lunch from twelve ten to
one-twenty.  School meals are served   
for sixty pence each but many children 
bring their own sandwiches.  The school
has four classes and as well as Maths, 
English and Topic work the children    
learn swimming and music.  Out of      
school activities include lessons in   
playing recorders, clarinet, guitar,

eleven most of the children go to      
Mascalls Comprehensive School in       
Paddock Wood but some choose to sit for
selection and try for Grammar Schools  </content>
