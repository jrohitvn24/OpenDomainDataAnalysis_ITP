		<content> THERE ARE THREE CHURCHES IN THE       
 VILLAGES OF KENN AND KENNFORD. THE    
 EARLIEST ONE,ST ANDREWS IN KENN DATES 
 FROM THE 14TH CENTURY AND WHOSE       
 MEMBERS BELONG TO THE CHURCH OF       
 ENGLAND.MEMBERS OF THE METHODIST      
 CHURCH HAVE A SMALL CHAPEL IN KENNFORD
 AS DOES ANOTHER NON CONFORMIST CHURCH.
 ST ANDREWS HAS A FINE ROOD WITH       
 FIGURES CARVED IN OBERAMERGAU IN      
 1889,THESE FIGURES BEING ADDED AT THAT
 TIME. THE SCREEN HAS PAINTINGS OF THE 
 SAINTS IN ITS LOWER PANELS. THE NON   
 CONFORMIST CHAPELS ARE MUCH PLAINER IN
 THEIR DESIGNS. THESE CONTRAST WITH ST 
 ANDREWS WHICH IS CONSIDERED HIGH      
 CHURCH WHILST THEY ARE LOW CHURCH.THE 
 FOLLOWING OF CHRIST IS ON THE INCREASE
 WITH PEOPLE FREE TO ATTEND THE PLACE  
 OF WORSHIP OF THEIR CHOICE.
