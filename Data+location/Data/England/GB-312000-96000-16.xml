		<content> The area is rich in flora and fauna.  
 Before the war cowslips were common   
 but now they are rare, as are oxslips,
 wild daffodils and early purple       
 orchids. Snowdrops, primroses,        
 bluebells are however still plentiful 
 and many garden flowers such as       
 fritillaries and daffodils have become
 naturalised. Lichens and all kinds of 
 fungi are common and in some of the   
 woods rare orchids can be found. Three
 of the old dew ponds have been filled 
 in which has diminished the numbers of
 dragonflies frogs and toads. All the  
 large native mammals are regularly    
 sighted with the exception of the     
 otter and the small mammals are also  
 present. Bird life is rich, recently  
 the kingfisher has been sighted again 
 and although barn owls are rare, they 
 are in the area. There is also a      
 report of a red squirrel in the valley</content>
