 Our block of land stretches from the  
 moors in the west to beyond Hoddlesden
 in the east,&amp; from the moors in the   
 south, to beyond Darwen town centre in
 the north.Near the town centre is     
 India Mill with its ornamental chimney
 Darwen's best known landmark.It was   
 the first mill in Britain to spin     
 nothing but artificial fibres.The     
 process of printing wallpaper on rolls
 was invented in Darwen.There are still
 wallpaper factories in town and an old
 printing machine by the side of the   
 main road.Darwen used to be a weaving 
 town,with 70 mills. Few are left,&amp;    
 even fewer are still in use.Now there 
 are more modern industries,e.g.I.C.I. 
 Perspex is made in the town.
