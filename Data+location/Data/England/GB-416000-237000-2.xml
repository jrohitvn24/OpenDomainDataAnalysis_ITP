 gently rising land including the      
 valley of the River Cam,an escarpment 
 rising to 156m running from East to   
 West across the area and two villages,
 Paxford and Ebrington.                
 From Marfurlong Farm one can see      
 buildings including glasshouses, a    
 network of 15_20acre fields enclosed  
 by hedges,Charingworth Manor on       
 horizon amongst conifers and a ridge  
 rising East with more glasshouses half
 _way up.Pudlicott Mill lies along the 
 valley where the Cam crosses          
 Campden_Shipston road.                
 From Briar Hill Farm northwards lies  
 Campden Research Station beside the   
 railway line.To the East Paxford is   
 surrounded by trees.On Southwest      
 slopes of Ebrington are two imposing  
 rows of poplar trees.
