		<title>16THE YEAVELEY SHOOT</title>
		<content>    My uncle owns the Yeaveley shoot.  
 The guns they use are 12 bore shot    
 guns. You have to be 17 to have a     
 licence for a shot gun, but you can   
 shoot or trap when you are 11 or 12.  
 My uncle teaches people how to shoot  
 as well. It costs Â£3.80 for a session 
 at the shoot, which includes using a  
 gun and as many clay pigeons as you   
 like.                                 
    At the shoot they never shoot      
 live animals or birds. Instead they   
 use clay  pigeons which are round     
 pieces of clay, they have big ones and
 small ones.                           
    My uncle goes on shooting trips    
 abroad and then he shoots animals like
 moose and deer.                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
