		<title>02Long Lawford Village</title>
		<content>  To the north of the area is the      
 village of Long Lawford.referred to in
 the Domesday Book as Lelleford (The   
 ford by the elders).The village is    
 reputed to be the largest village in  
 the country for it has grown in recent
 years due to the development of a     
 large amount of council housing and   
 the original identity of the village  
 has almost disappeared.Some of the    
 older housing still remains in Main   
 Street and Cross Street,the two       
 original streets in the village. In   
 truth, the village is now nothing more
 than a suburb of the nearby town of   
 Rugby which provides most of the      
 amenities and services for the        
 village.The services that do exist in 
 the village are few and the           
 surrounding countryside which forms   
 the largest part of the block is      
 dominated by agricultural use.        </content>
