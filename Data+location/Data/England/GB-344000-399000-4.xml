		<content>   Rainford consists of a mixture of   
 both extemely old and new houses of   
 varying styles surrounded by farmland.
   Bus services have hardly changed,   
 although they are cleaner and more    
 frequent.There was a railway which ran
 from St.Helens through Rainford and   
 into Southport.It is now the Linear   
 Park.There was a Colliery,a dayhigh,  
 and two pipemakers.These together with
 a pottery employ a lot of people.     
 Nowadays many small firms exist on an 
 industrial estate.                    
   Fashion has changed considerably in 
 recent years.Bright colours and casual
 clothes seem to dominate.             
   Earlier this century there was the  
 wireless and later the T.V.Now we have
 computers and videos.                 
   Vandalism,theft and personal attacks
 cause local people to always be on    
 their guard.                          </content>
