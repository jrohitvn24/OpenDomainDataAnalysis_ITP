    During Whit-week 1985,the Winster  
 Morris Men came one evening to perform
 the Taddington Morris Dance which the 
 members of the village Oddfellows     
 Lodge used to dance through the       
 village on Whit-Tuesday afternoons.The
 men would go to church in the morning,
 have a sit down meal in one of the    
 pubs and afterwards, still wearing    
 their suits and sashes of office would
 take out their white handkerchiefs and
 dance up the village.The Club Feasts  
 have not been held for over 50 years. 
    When my great grandma was a little 
 girl,over 100 years ago,children on   
 Shrove Tuesdays used to play games    
 like shuttlecock and battledore over  
 the churchyard hedge.That went when   
 the churchyard was enlarged in 1889   
 and the annual games seem to have died
 out.                                  </content>
