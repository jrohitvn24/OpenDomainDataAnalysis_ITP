		<content> Running roughly north to south along  
 the east bank of the River Colne is   
 the course of a disused railway.Here  
 are found many interesting grasses    
 such as meadow oat grass and velvet   
 bent.Flowers also grow here,like weld 
 and the pretty lady's bedstraw which  
 have yellow flowers.                  
 Rabbits,yellow hammers and some shy   
 partridges live along the track.      
 A pit full of water,site of a Roman   
 villa sadly destroyed by gravel       
 extraction,attracts swans,hordes of   
 damsel-flies,some Canada geese and a  
 few mallard ducks.Dragonflies hover   
 over the water,and midges abound,while
 skylarks sing,and sandmartins,from    
 nests in the gravel workings nearby,  
 swing overhead.
