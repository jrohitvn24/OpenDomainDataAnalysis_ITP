		<title>04DISUSED RAILWAY at ROCESTER</title>
		<content> In 1968 the railway was closed and is 
 now disused. The route the railway    
 took is still obvious, on the         
 whole,and the ditches on either side  
 of the track are apparent. Although   
 the sleepers are no longer there the  
 remains of the railway gravel are. Two
 station houses remain, one is         
 inhabited, while the other is         
 presently for sale. The track runs    
 through farming land and is completely
 lost at one stage in a field of corn. 
 The path is not very overgrown, but we
 saw buttercups,clover,speedwell,ladys 
 smock,dandelions,thistles and dock    
 leaves.We heard a cuckoo and saw wood 
 pigeons along with Fresian milking    
 cows. Several permanent puddles were  
 visible, containing tadpoles which    
 were beginning to sprout legs.
