		<title>19A day at Durweston School</title>
		<content>  The caretaker arrives first, then the
 teachers arrive. The Bryanston bus    
 arrives, most people start coming,    
 then the Stourpaine bus comes.        
  School starts at 9.10am. I look at   
 the temperature: the lowest has been  
 -9C, the highest +20C.                
  The first lesson is Handwriting, and 
 someone writes about our School pond. 
 The next lesson is Maths, before it's 
 playtime.                             
  After that we go to Assembly in the  
 Hall, where we sing a hymn, have a    
 story about Jesus, and say some       
 prayers. We do a 'Reading Route' card,
 then we have dinner.                  
  We play, then we finish our reading  
 before we go out for Rounders. When   
 that is over we show our teacher our  
 Domesday folder, then we clear away.  
 Someone says a made-up prayer for us  
 and we go home at 3.30pm.             </content>
