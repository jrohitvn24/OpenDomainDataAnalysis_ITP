		<title>01THE VILLAGE SHOP</title>
		<content> The village shop in{Little Dewchurch  
 is like most such shops in this area. 
 It has{room for about 10 customers}and
 is{rather crowded. }The goods are on  
{shelves}on the walls, and customers   
{ask the shopkeeper}for what they want 
 instead of getting it themselves and  
 paying on the way out.   This shop has
 been in the{same family for 60 years. 
 It is{not doing as well as it once did
 because it is{no longer a Post Office 
 and the{expenses}are getting too high.
 Also, people now shop at{superstores  
 in{Hereford}instead, where there is   
 much{more choice}and the goods are    
{cheaper.  }The shop has mainly{sweets,
{cigarettes,}and some{groceries.       
 Business is much the same all year    
 round, except when it{snows}- then    
 people get blocked in and can't get to
 Hereford, so they have to use the     
 shop.                                 </content>
