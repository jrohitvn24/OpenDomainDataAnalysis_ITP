		<title>14PETS KEPT IN PONTESBURY</title>
		<content> We surveyed 22 houses in Pontesbury to
 find out what kind of pets people     
 keep.  Most of the people owned cats  
 and dogs but one lady had an albino   
 rat.  Most people bought pedigree dogs
 from a specialist breeder, but cats   
 came from pet shops.  One Burmese cat 
 had been bought from a breeder in     
 London.  Everyone valued their pets'  
 company and talked to them a lot.  All
 the pets were tame and playful except 
 for two 'oldies'.                     
 The pets were kept inside the house,  
 except for one dog who lived in an    
 outside kennel.  Most of the dogs were
 fed on biscuit meal and tinned dog    
 meat.  A Staffordshire bull terrier   
 was fed on raw meat from the butcher. 
 Cats were fed on tinned meat,with some
 table scraps. Dogs were brushed and   
 shampooed regularly and exercised     
 daily.                                </content>
