		<content> The whole area is covered with        
 boulder clay deposited during the Ice 
 Age.Below the clay are beds of the    
 Lower Lias (clays and limestone) which
 have been exposed by the stream.The   
 valley floor is covered with alluvial 
 deposits.The glacier from the Ice Age 
 also left deposits of gravel which    
 provided the sites for most villages  
 in the area.These sites are well      
 drained and safe from flooding.       
 Villagers with gardens enjoy good soil
 conditions,for it is light and easily 
 worked,but for those gardeners who    
 live on the clay it is very different.
 There the soil is heavy and sticky    
 when wet and as hard as iron when dry.
 The area is however very fertile and  
 farmers find that they can grow grass 
 or corn equally well on the different 
 soils.
