 radio to communicate with each        
 other,C.B. stands for Citizens        
 Band.The Police in our area of Britain
 are the{Devon and Cornwall            
 Constabulary,and in their area is one 
 helicopter which is based at          
 Exeter. P.C.Pridham is our local      
 Police Constable,he patrols mainly    
 three villages and occasionally a     
 small town called {Ivybridge}.He      
 drives a car called a 'Panda Car'.    
 There are not many crimes committed in
 the area,in the last two months two   
 'breaking and entering' crimes have   
 been committed.The Police use big     
 'Ford Granada' cars for patroling main
 roads and Motorways. The{Tavistock    
{Police} patrol the village of{        
{Clearbrook}.
