		<title>12Farming around Crediton</title>
		<content>   There are{many types}of farming     
 around Crediton. Here are a few of    
 them: poultry, pigs, sheep, cow, deer 
 and arable.                           
  {Arable}(swedes, turnips, corn etc.) 
 farms are not very common in Devon    
 because the ground contains a very    
 high percentage of clay.              
  {Livestock}(cows, sheep, pigs etc.)  
 farming is more popular because the   
 grass in Devon is good; it also brings
 in more money. People keep cows for   
 showing, beef, milk and other dairy   
 products. Sheep are also very popular 
 because of their wool and meat and for
 showing at local shows{e.g.Devon      
{County Show.}Pigs are also kept for   
 showing and meat.                     
  {Chickens,}turkeys, geese and ducks  
 are kept either{free range}or in      
{battery farms.}They are kept for their
 meat, eggs and feathers.              </content>
