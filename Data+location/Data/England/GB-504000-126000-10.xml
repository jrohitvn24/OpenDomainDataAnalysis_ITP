		<title>10FOOTBALL IN WIS. GREEN</title>
		<content> Football is played every Saturday in  
 winter on the village green.          
      There are eleven players on each 
 side in football.Usually a goalkeeper 
 with four defenders, three midfielders
 and three attackers.You can use any   
 part of your body to play, except your
 hands.                                
      It is a penalty in football to   
 "handball" inside the area or if you  
 commit a foul by tripping someone up. 
 An offence outside the area yields a  
 free-kick.                            
      A goal is scored by kicking the  
 ball between two white posts and below
 the crossbar.If you score in the wrong
 goal, it is an "own goal" and is      
 credited to the other team.           
     There are two men's teams and a   
 junior team in the village.
