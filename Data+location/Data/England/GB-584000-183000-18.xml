 As you walk from the cliff lift along 
 the sea-front with the sea on your    
 left, on your right are the cliff     
 gardens, then the arch-way cafes at   
 Westcliff and the Cliffs Pavilion     
 above you. Near the arch-way cafes you
 see Rossi's, a well known ice-cream   
 manufacturer in the area. Their       
 ice-cream is delicious and there are  
 lots of different flavours. Along the 
 Western Esplanade you can see the     
 Westcliff Leisure Centre where lots of
 sporting activities go on. There is   
 also a disco and bar there. It was    
 built where the old outdoor swimming  
 pool used to be. At Chalkwell you can 
 see where the new sea-wall has been   
 built near the bowling greens at the  
 bottom of Chalkwell Avenue.
