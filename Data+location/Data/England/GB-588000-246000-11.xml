		<title>11SAXON ESTATE BOUNDARY: ACTON</title>
		<content>{Saxon Times}                          
The present day boundaries of the nor- 
thern half of Acton Parish coincide    
with the Balsdon Estate boundaries     
described by Aelfflaed, wife of the    
Saxon hero Byrhtnoth, in her Will. The 
name still survives today in Balsdon   
Hall which still has moated enclosures.
A boundary point described in the Will 
as Humelcyrre is remembered today in   
Humblechar Meadows. The cyrr, Saxon for
bend, refers to a sharp change in dir- 
ection in Chad Brook where it was      
joined by a tributary from the N.E.    
Humel means a rounded hillock.         
In the S.W. of the block an ancient    
track called Roydon Drift is referred  
to in this Saxon Will as Roydon.       
A Gospel Oak stood near the point where
the disused railway line meets a       
by-road.
