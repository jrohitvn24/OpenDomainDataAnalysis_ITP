		<title>19SEWAGE DISPOSAL</title>
		<content> THE SEWAGE TANKER DRAWS UP TO OUR     
 HOUSE. THE DRIVER COMES TO THE DOOR   
 AND HE ASKS US IF WE WANT THE PIT     
 FULLY EMPTYING OR ONLY HALF EMPTYING. 
 WE SAY HALF EMPTYING. HE FINDS A SAFE 
 SPOT TO PARK. THEN TAKES OFF THE PIPE 
 AT THE SIDE OF THE TANKER. NORMALLY   
 THERE ARE TWO MEN. THEY TAKE THE PIPE 
 TO THE CESSPOOL AND START THE PUMP AND
 EMPTY IT HALF WAY. THEY KNOW HOW DEEP 
 IT IS. THEY HAVE A BIG ENOUGH TANKER. 
 THEY HAVE TO TAKE THE COVER OFF THE   
 POOL AND PUT IT BACK ON TIGHTLY.      
 AFTERWARDS THEY SWITCH OFF THE MOTOR  
 AND FIX THE PIPE TO THE TANKER AGAIN  
 AND DRIVE AWAY. BEFORE THEY GO DOWN   
 THE ROAD THEY CLOSE THE END SO THAT   
 SEWAGE DOESN'T ESCAPE. THE COUNCIL    
 SEWAGE TANKERS TAKE THEIR LOADS TO A  
 SEWAGE WORKS AND LOCAL FARMERS SPREAD 
 THEIRS ON THEIR FIELDS.
