		<title>18HOUSING AT BRIDGE END.</title>
		<content>   At Bridge End, Dalston, there are   
 many different styles of houses,      
 ranging from the old to the very new. 
   There are several old, detached     
 houses along the Dalston road (B5299).
   Along by the River Caldew, at Bridge
 End, there is the Forge Green and the 
 Council Estate. These houses are      
 whitewashed and are semi-detached. The
 Forge Green is an old sandstone house 
 that is owned by the Parish Council.  
 They let it out once a year.          
   The newest housing estate in Dalston
 is about the newest housing in the    
 whole of our area. It is called       
 "Forge Mill" and is situated at Bridge
 End. These houses were built in 1980. 
 They are detached, modern houses that 
 have built-in garages.
