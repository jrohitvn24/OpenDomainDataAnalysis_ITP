		<title>01A review of block 04280258</title>
		<content>  This block of Central Warwicksire is 
 totally rural in nature containing no 
 settlements at all.Therefore it       
 contains very few amenities and       
 farming is the dominant activity. The 
 farming is of a mixed nature with the 
 arable land usually given over to corn
 crops and the pasture to beef cattle  
 and sheep. The soil is of a clayey    
 nature and is generally fertile. The  
 landscape is gently rolling, while the
 field pattern largely retains its 18th
 century character, although there has 
 been some field amalgamation.         
  The block also contains a large      
 deciduous woodland, Oakley Wood, that 
 is actively forested. Trees as they   
 are harvested are replaced by         
 saplings.
