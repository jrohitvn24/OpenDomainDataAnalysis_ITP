		<title>14Movement to New Town S.W.F.</title>
		<content>    People have moved into{South       
{Woodham Ferrers}from all over the     
 country. The main reasons for moviing 
 seem to be husband's new job or       
 promotion and the comparitively cheap,
 large, new properties.                
    The majority of workers are        
 commuters travelling by train or car  
 to Brentwood, Basildon, Chelmsford or 
 various areas of London.              
    Some people moved to{South Woodham 
{Ferrers}because they liked the quiet  
 village atmosphere and the attractive 
 well-planned location.                
    This quiet area seems to have      
 little trouble from vandals and       
 everyone knows the village policemen. 
    Some people moved to find newer and
 smaller schools for their children.   
    Others moved from an over-populated
 built-up area. One family had been    
 burgled in their previous home.       </content>
