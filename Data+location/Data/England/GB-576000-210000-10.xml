		<content> In our school we carried out a survey 
 to find out about the jobs that       
 parents of the children at school do. 
 We found out that over half the       
 fathers work in the village and       
 surrounding areas while the others    
 commute to London each day. Fathers   
 that work in the village and          
 surrounding area have jobs such as    
 farmers,railway workers, British      
 telecom workers and local policemen.  
 The fathers that work in London have a
 variety of jobs such as taxi drivers, 
 bank workers, printers, tailors,      
 solicitors, civil engineers and       
 security guards.Most of the children's
 mothers who worked, did so in the     
 village and surrounding area. They had
 jobs including school dinner ladies,  
 shop assistants, secretaries,cleaners,
 teachers, and jewellers. There are    
 only four fathers who are unemployed. </content>
