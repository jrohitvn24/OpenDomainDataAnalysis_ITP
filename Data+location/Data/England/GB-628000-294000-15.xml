		<title>15LOCAL HISTORY:WOODTON AREA</title>
		<content> These parishes have Saxon settlement  
 names:Woodton,in a wood;Brooke,near a 
 stream;Kirstead,near a church &amp;       
 Seething,of Sip(a)'s people.          
 Woodton's claim to fame is Admiral    
 Lord Nelson,whose mother was Catherine
 Suckling.His grandfather Maurice,     
 rector of Woodton,was brother to      
 Robert,Lord of Woodton Manor,so Nelson
 spent many school holidays at Woodton.
 In 1905,commemorating the connection,a
 Parish room was built;the foundation  
 stone laid by Earl Nelson on Trafalgar
 Day.Seething achieved its place in    
 history when the airfield built there 
 1942-3 became the operational HQ for  
 the 8th USAF 448th Bomb Group,whose   
 B24 Liberators flew 262 missions.     
 Though sold in 1959,with most runways 
 broken up for road-building &amp; the land
 returned to farming,there is still    
 enough for the Waveney Flying Club.   </content>
