		<title>19Stebbings History</title>
		<content> The sites of 3 Roman villas have been 
 found in Stebbing,and a Roman cemetery
 with 40 skeletons.Stebbing was a      
 Saxon village and we think its name   
 comes from Stybbinga meaning meadow of
 Stybba.Before the Norman Conquest the 
 village was owned by a Saxon thegn    
 called Siward.The Domesday record is  
 complete for Stebbing.There were two  
 manors.Henry de Ferrers was given     
 Stebbing Park and Ralph Peverell      
 settled where Parsonage Farm is now.  
 One member of the Ferrers family      
 served on the Domesday Commission.    
 There was a mill,probably where Town  
 Mill stands today.The church and the  
 manor at Parsonage Farm were given to 
 the Knights Hospitallers of St.John of
 Jerusalem and were a monastery until  
 the Dissolution.Stebbing is a         
 conservation area.
