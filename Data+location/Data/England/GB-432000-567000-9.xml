		<content> The Tynemouth Incinerator began       
 working in 1971.It receives all the   
 rubbish from the North Tyneside area  
 and 50% of Newcastle's waste.         
  The raw rubbish is brought to the    
 Incinerator by the dustbin lorries    
 where it is burnt down by 90% to a    
 kind of ash. This ash is then taken to
 a landfill area where it is covered   
 under land reclaimation. The          
 Incinerator handles 500 tonnes of raw 
 rubbish daily and because of regular  
 upkep it now produces more than the   
 day it opened.It will stay working for
 another 10 years when it will be      
 either be replaced by a re-cycling    
 plant ,or a waste disposal plant which
 could easily be adapted to produce    
 electricity.
