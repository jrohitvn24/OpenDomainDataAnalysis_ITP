		<title>07BRINGSTYE HONEY FARM.</title>
		<content> Mr.R.May has had a {honey farm} near  
 Blakedown for about 15 years and needs
 to harvest 10 tons of honey before    
 making any profit.He has been         
 interested in bees since the age of 15
 and now has 400 hives spread over     
 Staffordshire,Hereford &amp; Worcester and
 Shropshire.At the height of the season
 each hive can be occupied by 40 to 50 
 thousand bees.                        
    Summer is a busy time for Mr.May   
 but much effort is required throughout
 the year.After extracting the honey in
 July &amp; August the bees have to be fed 
 sugar and water as food for the Winter
 Wasps can be a menace robbing and     
 destroying weaker colonies.Winter is  
 spent mending and making hives and    
 equipment for the Spring when there   
 are constant checks that all is well. 
    Mr.May recently removed a large    
 swarm from a shop window in Kidd.     </content>
