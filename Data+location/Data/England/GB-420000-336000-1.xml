		<title>01LONGFORD AREA</title>
		<content>{   Longford is a small and attractive 
 village. It has pretty houses and     
 interesting buildings like the        
 cheese factory, the mill, the pump    
 house and the old school.             
    The cheese factory is used for     
 storing grain now_a_days, but it was  
 the first cheese factory to be built. 
 The mill is next to the brook and     
 sometimes they turn the big wheel.    
 The pump house is a strange building, 
 it used to pump water in the old      
 days.                                 
    Not actually in the village is     
 Longford Hall. It is a manor house.   
 Next door to the Hall is the church.  
 It is unusual for a church to be out  
 of the village.                       
    In this area we have cattle and    
 crops. We grow wheat, barley, oilseed 
 rape, peas and potatoes.
