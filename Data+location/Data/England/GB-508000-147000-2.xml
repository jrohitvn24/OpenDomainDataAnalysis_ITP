		<content> As the A25 has been one of the main   
 routes east-west across SE England,   
 the villages along this road have had 
 to put up with heavy traffic both     
 commercial and private. The narrow    
 road at this point and the resultant  
 safety aspects have been of concern to
 the villagers. The opening of the     
 southern stretches of the M25 have,   
 however, helped to alleviate the      
 situation by diverting much of the    
 traffic, particularly the lorries and 
 juggernauts.                          
                                       
 The Tonbridge-Reading railway line    
 also runs along the edge of the Downs.
 The only station in the block is at   
 Gomshall.                             
                                       
 A bus service from Dorking to         
 Guildford runs through the villages.
