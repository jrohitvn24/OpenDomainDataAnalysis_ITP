		<title>19FARMING</title>
		<content> There are quite a few farms around    
 Ashover,some are dairy farms and some 
 are beef farms.Willmots have a farm   
 their farm is a dairy farm.We have a  
 farm but we farm for beef.There is    
 someone up the road from us who still 
 milks his cows by hand.Ashover has    
 quite a few farms round it and theres 
 quite a bit of farm land round Ashover
 as well.Here are some peoples names   
 that have farms around the district of
 Ashover_:Austin's,Bonsall's,Bradley's,
 Montague's,Bown's,Tomlinson's,Beardow'
 s,Homle's,Holes and Hinchley.These    
 people have been here for many years. 
 Most people dairy farm in and around  
 Ashover.Farms usually have labourers  
 (that means to work there).In the     
 early days farmers didn't have        
 tractors and things like that,they    
 had horses instead.Things have        
 really changed since the old days.    </content>
