		<content>Our school is about 18 metres long and 
a third of that is divided by a        
partition making two classrooms.There  
is no office.There are 18 pupils on    
roll this year,but we expect 26 next   
term.All the children live in the      
village or on outlying farms.          
The Headteacher is assisted by a part- 
time teacher and a Clerk/Ancillary     
helper.We have a Caretaker who is also 
the dinner-lady.We are too small a     
school to have hot meals provided at   
lunch-time,so if we need to stay we    
bring sandwiches.A music teacher visits
us twice a week.We are part of a Rural 
Schools Enrichment Project.We use a    
mini-bus to take us on visits and we   
perform plays and concerts at least    
twice a year for our parents and the   
old people.We go swimming every two    
weeks at Brackley Baths and this year  
we spent three days on a canal boat.   </content>
