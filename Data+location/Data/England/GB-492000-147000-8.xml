		<title>08A DAY AT PUTTENHAM SCHOOL</title>
		<content> I wake at half past six when I feel   
 footsteps running across my bed.I     
 don't need an alarm clock because my  
 kittens wake me.I quickly get out of  
 bed,put on my blue and white school   
 dress and run down to the dining room 
 for my breakfast of cornflakes and    
 toast.After brushing my teeth and     
 packing my swimming kit I am driven   
 to school by car.When the bell rings  
 and we have been marked on the        
 register we are ready to go by coach  
 to the swimming pool.When we return to
 school we have milk and apples before 
 playtime.After an hour of Maths it is 
 time for lunch and then we play games,
 such as "Grandmother's footsteps."    
 During the afternoon I paint and do   
 English before going home. After tea I
 read, collect my sister from school   
 and play with the kittens before going
 to bed at half past seven.{KATIE.     </content>
