		<title>17THE INKWORKS - LINTZFORD</title>
		<content>    The ink is produced for newspapers 
 and packaging and also sold to all    
 types of printers throughout the      
 United Kingdom as well as to various  
 countries in the world.               
    All colours of ink are             
 manufactured. The ink is made from a  
 recipe of which the main ingredients  
 are oils, varnishes, various pigments 
 and solvents. These are mixed together
 then this mixture is ground through a 
 three roll machine mill. The works    
 have three of these roll mills, some  
 mixers and various other machines.    
 Approximately twenty to thirty tons of
 ink are sold each week.               
    The Company owns about three acres 
 of land, two vans, two Heavy Goods    
 vehicles and quite a few Company cars.
