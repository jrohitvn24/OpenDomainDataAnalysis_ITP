		<title>01      WOOTTON WAWEN</title>
		<content>     Wootton Wawen is a small village  
 of about 1400 people, situated about 8
 miles due west of Warwick, its county 
 town.                                 
                                       
     It is situated amidst farmland and
 thus provides few opportunities for   
 work for the inhabitants.  Many of the
 people commute daily to Birmingham,   
 Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwick and other
 towns for employment.                 
                                       
     There is a large Mobile Home Park 
 in the village which caters mainly for
 elderly and retired people.           
                                       
    Wootton Wawen is a village which,  
 at first sight, seems to offer little 
 of interest. However, it has a history
 dating back to Saxon times and is     
 worth a detailed study.
