		<content> One of the most ancient villages      
 around Doncaster,Braithwell was known 
 as Bradeuulle in 1086.                
 The Village Cross erected in 1191     
 purported to be connected with the    
 ransom contributed by the villagers to
 release Richard 1,a prisoner in       
 Germany.A charter to hold an annual   
 fair was awarded.Moat Hall has        
 connections with Roche Abbey.Once     
 pigeons were bred extensively for     
 food,in the stables and dovecote, now 
 a cottage.Lambcote Grange, dating from
 1186,was farmed by the monks of Roche 
 Abbey for 356 years,after which it    
 passed into private ownership.There   
 are several fine old buildings in the 
 district, e.g.Hall Farm,1683. Some    
 have bricked up windows due to the    
 Window Tax,1698-1851.                 
 The main street of the village is     
 designated a Conservation Area.       </content>
