		<title>01Around Holbeach Bank.</title>
		<content> The three villages in our block       
 are Holbeach Bank,Saracen's Head and  
 Moulton Seas  End.The landscape       
 around here is very flat and          
 fertile and is intensively farmed. The
 nearest town, Holbeach, is two miles  
 away but there is a village shop and  
 post office in Saracen's Head         
 and Moulton Seas End. The roads are   
 often tracks leading to farms and     
 allotments.The farmers around here    
 have mostly vegetable crops. Some     
 fields have cows and sheep in.The     
 present Sea Bank round the  wash is   
 about 10 km from our block.The name   
 Moulton Seas End shows that the sea   
 used to come much further inland.The  
 village of Holbeach Bank which was    
 built along the original sea bank     
 before the Domesday Book was compiled 
 in 1086.The block was marshland then.
