 Boothroyd, he gets up at 6:00 with his
 two sons to milk 37 cows.(The cows are
 milked four at a time) it takes one   
 and a half hours to milk them all.    
 About 70 gallons a day is sent to     
 Dickinsons Creamery. Some of the milk 
 is kept on the farm for the local     
 authorities to come and test. The farm
 is inspected once a month to see it is
 disease free. Mr. Boothroyd bottles   
 his own milk,he has three workers who 
 deliver the milk to his 600 customers.
 Mr. Boothroyd has 58 cows in his herd

 37 are milkers and 21 are dry.Each cow
 gives about 5 gallons of milk a day   
 which makes a total of 185 gallons a  
 day. Mr. Boothroyd has 79 acres of    
 land. The oldest building on the farm 
 is 151 years old.
