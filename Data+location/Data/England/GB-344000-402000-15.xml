		<content>There are several ideas as to the      
derivatives of the name Rainford. One  
is that the first part is part of an   
Old English name Regna. Thus Regna's   
ford. Some suggest is derived from     
Anglo-Saxon word "Rand"                
   Recent discoveries have however     
given a new perspective. A family named
Rainford originated from Randers Fjiord
in Denmark and came to England in 1066.
The similarity of names Randers Fjiord 
and Rainford drew people to the        
conclusion that when the family        
obtained land in Lancashire they called
it after the family name.              
    In the Nineteenth Century large    
changes took place due to the          
industrial  revolution. Agriculture    
prospered, aided by farming methods    
and in the indutrial parts of the area 
employment was provided by the clay    
pipe and coal mining industries.       </content>
