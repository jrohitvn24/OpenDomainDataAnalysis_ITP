		<title>16Holidays in Cornwall</title>
		<content> Lots of people come to Cornwall every 
 year for theirnholidays.They like it  
 here because there are lots of beaches
 and we get quite good weather.People  
 like to sunbathe on the beaches but   
 two months ago some children were     
 playing on the rocks at Penzance and a
 big wave came and swept them into the 
 sea and four of them were drowned so  
 it can be dangerous.                  
   If they don't want to go on the     
 beach there are lots of other places  
 they can go such as Ha'penny Park     
 where you only pay half a penny to get
 in but you have to pay for anything   
 you want to go on in there.They can go
 to Helston Aero Park and it's great   
 because they have Moon Buggies and    
 aircraft and a complete village in a  
 big room,just like it was a long time 
 ago.We went to St.Michael's Mount this
 year for our school trip.It was good. </content>
