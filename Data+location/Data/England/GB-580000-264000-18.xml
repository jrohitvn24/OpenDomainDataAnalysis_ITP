		<content>  Because the area has been intensively
farmed there has been considerable     
effect on the natural environment. This
can be most obviously seen in the move 
to bigger fields to accommodate modern 
machinery and the resultant loss of    
hedgerows with their animal habitats   
and wild flowers. Another by-product of
larger fields has been the loss of many
footpaths which have been ploughed over
and lost to public use except where    
ramblers' associations are active.     
  Issues which have arisen in recent   
times with regard to pollution include 
the pollution of streams by nitrate    
fertilizers, the possible dangers for  
people and animals of aerial           
crop-spraying and the anti-social      
effects of stubble burning after the   
harvest.
