		<title>05A MODERN FARM, BEER</title>
		<content> This dairy farm is worked by three    
 people; the farmer, his wife and one  
 employee. The 100 acres have been     
 farmed for 500 years. 100 cows and 30 
 calves are kept on the land which     
 formerly supported just 20 cows. There
 is a milking parlour where 10 cows are
 milked at once. The milk is stored in 
 a bulk tank until collected daily by a
 tanker for the Milk Marketing Board. A
 computer monitors the cows' health and
 feeding, issuing the correct amount of
 feed to ensure maximum milk yield. The
 computer recognises each cow by a     
 collar worn on its neck. The farmer   
 would like more cows, but his milk    
 quota from the European Economic      
 Community prevents this. Formerly     
 cereal crops were grown, but now the  
 land is sown and fertilised grassland 
 used for pasture, with some hay being 
 made, but it is mainly cut for silage.</content>
