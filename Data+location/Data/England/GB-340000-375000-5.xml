		<title>05THE BOAT MUSEUM</title>
		<content> The Boat Museum was founded for the   
 preservation of canal boats, their    
 artefacts and folklore. It was opened 
 on 12th. June 1976 in the basin of the
 Shropshire Union Canal.               
 Today the museum employs 80 people, 50
 of whome are part_time and has many   
 volunteers. Full time staff work an 8 
 hour day, and last year showed 85,000 
 visitors around the site. Of these,   
 25,000 were school children.          
 Work on restoring the site and        
 exhibits still goes on. Each year     
 about three boats are restored,and    
 they are now restoring "Mendip". Old  
 buildings such as the Pump House, Toll
 House and Island Warehouse have been  
 restored.
