		<title>05St Esprit Church Marton.</title>
		<content> There has been a church in Marton for 
 centuries. The first stone building   
 was erected in 1296.It was demolished,
 due to its poor state of repair and   
 rebuilt in 1871.Little remains of the 
 original church.Its importance in the 
 religious life of Marton has declined 
 steadily.The vicar,who is based at    
 Long Itchington,serves two parishes.  
 There are 6 services a month and even_
 song every two months for a regular   
 congregation of 12.There is an active 
 Altar Guild providing servers.However 
 the villagers are enthusiastic about  
 the upkeep of the church.Sixty ladies 
 clean the church on a rota basis.On   
 "Boon Day"all the ladies spring clean 
 the church.They enter the "Best Kept  
 Church yard" competition,in which they
 have been quite successful. The Flower
 Guild decorate the church for the     
 great feast days .                    </content>
