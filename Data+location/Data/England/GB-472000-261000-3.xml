SLIGHTLY TO THE NORTH, AROUND THE ROMAN
CATHOLIC CATHEDRAL,IS MUCH MORE        
RESIDENTIAL AND THE HOUSES HERE ARE    
MUCH BETTER DECORATED AND CARED FOR    
THAN THOSE TO THE SOUTH. ALTHOUGH THE  
ROADS ARE IN A GOOD STATE OF REPAIR THE
PAVEMENTS ARE OFTEN BADLY CRACKED. MOST
RESIDENTS WE SPOKE TO LIKED THE AREA.  
MANY ELDERLY PEOPLE TOLD US IT IS A    
VERY FRIENDLY PLACE TO LIVE IN BUT THEY
WOULD BE HAPPIER IF A CHEMIST AND A    
SUPERMARKET WERE CLOSER AT HAND. A GOOD
PART OF THE AREA IS TAKEN UP BY A TREE-
LINED PARK- WHICH WAS AT ONE TIME THE  
NORTHAMPTON RACECOURSE. THE HOUSES     
ALONG ST. GEORGES AVENUE ARE VERY MUCH 
BIGGER, QUITE OFTEN DETATCHED, AND IN A
DESIRABLE POSITION OVERLOOKING THE     
PARK.
