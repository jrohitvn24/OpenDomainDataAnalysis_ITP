		<title>19HOLYWELL V.C. MIDDLE SCHOOL</title>
		<content>  Almost all of the village children   
 pass through the local Middle school  
 which is situated at the end of Red   
 Lion Close.                           
  Built in stages  but initially opened
 in 1973 the school now provides       
 education for approximately 530       
 children from the age of 9 to 13. The 
 vast majority of pupils come from the 
 lower schools in the villages of      
 Cranfield and Wootton.                
  On leaving Holywell Middle V.C.      
 School the children then continue     
 their education at the Upper school in
 Wootton.                              
  There are 23 full-time staff and     
 several ancillary staff working at    
 Holywell. School meals are provided   
 for those children who wish to have a 
 cooked midday meal.                   
  The children who live in Wootton are 
 transported to Cranfield by coach.    </content>
