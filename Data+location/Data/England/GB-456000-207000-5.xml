		<title>05Road Repairs On The A40</title>
		<content>The road between Sandhills and Wheatley
was repaired in the Autumn of 1984.It  
cost 1,650,000 pounds. The road was    
repaired because it was starting to    
crack with the weather and the car     
wheels wore it down and made it go     
bumpy. It took 15 men to repair the    
road. There were five different layers.
The bottom layer was 15 cm of big      
stones, then there were another 15 cm  
of smaller stones, then there was 23 cm
of even smaller stones, then there were
6 cm of small stones called base course
and the last layer is 4 cm of sand and 
asphalt. So altogether there are 63 cm 
in a road. When the road was repaired, 
the kerbs were taken away and a metre  
of road was added on each side. The    
hedge was taken from the middle of the 
road so that big machines could be     
used. When the road was finished, the  
hedge was replanted.                   </content>
