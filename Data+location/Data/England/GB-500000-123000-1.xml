		<title>01GENERAL REVIEW - PETWORTH NE</title>
		<content> This is an outstanding area of        
 beautiful rolling countryside         
 dominated by many trees, but very     
 sparsely populated. Many farms of all 
 sizes from 15 to 550 acres are        
 scattered around. About 30% of the    
 area is still deciduous woodland,     
 remnants of the original Wealden      
 Forest. East of the A272 road woods   
 are being sold off and houses built to
 owners' designs and requirements. This
 is the most prosperous part. Land to  
 the west is part of the Leconfield    
 Estate. The whole district gives an   
 impression of peace and charm; it is  
 not under an air route and summer     
 traffic noise on the main road is     
 muted by distance. Apart from the new 
 housing and necessary modern          
 innovations, life style in this area  
 seems to have remained mainly         
 unchanged for hundreds of years.      </content>
