		<title>01Farm Land West of Dorchester</title>
		<content> The area comprises essentilly         
 undulating chalk farm land used for   
 growing wheat and barley. This high   
 ground is well suited for working by  
 large machinery and in general is     
 farmed by large co-operatives. The    
 lower ground in the Winterbourne      
 Valley is wetter and provides rich    
 grass land for animal grazing. The    
 valley is punctuated by the A35 the   
 main route to Devon for holiday       
 makers. The village of Winterbourne   
 Abbas lies on a small stream which    
 normally breaks in February - hence   
 its name. There is no industry in the 
 area but the village provides the     
 essential requirements. It is at      
 present expanding with new properties.
 Most villagers commute to the nearby  
 towns for employment. Few large woods 
 still exist due to intensive farming,
