 At about 12.30 am on Friday 28 July   
 1985, a group of 12 pupils from Bishop
 Fox's School, Taunton, visited Pyleigh
 Manor Farm, near Bishop's Lydeard,    
 Somerset.                             
 The owner of the farm is Mr. Mark Day,
 a polite, well-spoken gentleman in his
 late 60s. He welcomed the school group
 and showed them around his farm.      
                                       
 The first port of call was the milking
 parlour. Mr. Day showed the children  
 how the cattle were milked every day  
 and explained the function of each    
 item in the parlour. Today cattle are 
 milked more quickly and hygienically  
 than at any time in the past.
