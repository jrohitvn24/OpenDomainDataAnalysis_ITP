		<title>10ANGMERING PARK</title>
		<content> Angmering park is 1,100 acres leased  
 from the Norfolk Estate, planted in   
 1950 as a forest to replace hazel     
 coppice with oak. The forest today is 
 a mixed forest, norway spruce, scots  
 pine, douglas fir, corsican pine and  
 oak, beech and chestnut. Production of
 timber is accomplished by using a     
 system of block planting. Different   
 blocks are planted at different dates 
 to ensure continuous rotation and     
 production. The block is cleared      
 mechanically, then saplings are       
 interplanted at 2m intervals (2,000   
 trees/acre) with conifers interplanted
 between deciduous trees. Weeding is   
 done mechanically for 5 years. At 5   
 and 10 year intervals, thinnings      
 become pulp and fencing. At 50 years  
 conifers are removed fully for        
 construction, giving hardwoods space  
 to mature for furniture at 140 years. </content>
