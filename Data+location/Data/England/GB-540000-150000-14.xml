		<title>14FESTIVALS IN HURST GREEN</title>
		<content>  Hurst Green is quite a growing area. 
 Houses and estates are making new     
 homes for outsiders.  Therefore there 
 is a greater need for clubs and       
 activities.                           
  Every year in June{Moor House School}
 holds a fete. It includes             
 competitions, family events, small zoo
 and games. Also every year a fair is  
 held in{St Agatha's Hall.}A theme is  
 chosen. Every year Guides, Scouts,    
 Brownies and Cubs dress up. The       
 activities are games and competitions.
 There may be an ambulance or fire     
 engine to inspect. All stalls are held
 by charitable groups.                 
  These fairs are helped by Churches.  
 The Methodist provides services for   
 children with club facilities. A      
 family service lasts 1 hour with      
 children leaving after 15 minutes to  
 attend Sunday School.                 </content>
