		<title>15GUNTHWAITE SPA.</title>
		<content> The group stopped in front of the spa 
 and filled a bottle with the water. It
 smelt of rotten eggs. The smell was   
 sulphurdioxide. This water is supposed
 to have a medicinal effect. The water 
 is best drunk on the first Sunday of  
 May, when it is believed to cure      
 ailments.There is a walk to the spa on
 this day to celebrate this custom and 
 the spa is a very popular tourist     
 attraction.                           
   Now the spa is walled off, but the  
 water can be obtained by a tap in the 
 side of the wall. The path leading    
 past the spa has a large stone wall,  
 with a ring for tethering horses,     
 embedded in it. At the rear of the spa
 is a sign saying:                     
   ' THE PURITY OF THIS WATER CAN NOT  
 BE GUARANTEED. IT IS ADVISABLE TO BOIL
 IT BEFORE DRINKING.'
