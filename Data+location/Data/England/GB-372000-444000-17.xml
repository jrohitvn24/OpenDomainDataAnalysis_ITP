		<title>17TOURISM IN THE RIBBLE VALLEY</title>
		<content>TOURISM in the area is now a very      
important economic factor.Ribble Vall- 
ey has been for many years an attracti-
ve place to visit-it is an area of out-
standing Natural Beauty.The policy of  
the Borough Council is to develop and  
publicise the attraction of the area.  
The Council has set up a Tourist Infor-
mation Centre in the foyer of its offi-
ces where information on hotels,farm-  
houses,shops,walks,museums,parking     
places and places of interest can be   
obtained.Guides,maps and free litera-  
ture is also provided by the N.W.Tour- 
ist Board.The acceptance by the general
public that there is nothing wrong or  
immoral with people having leisure time
has led to the improvement in many     
hotels,inns and farm accommodation.In  
Ch'burn and Wadd'ton 30-40 people are  
emloyed in service industries due to   
the influx of tourists.                </content>
