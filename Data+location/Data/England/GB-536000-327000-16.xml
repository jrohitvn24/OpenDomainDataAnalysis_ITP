		<content>  Children from the Hurn are picked up 
 along the 3 mile route by school      
 bus.School begins at 9 o'clock.We have
 assembly straight away every          
 morning.Sometimes the children take   
 it,on Tuesday the vicar takes it.After
 assembly,register and collection of   
 letters,money etc.we usually spend the
 morning doing Maths.,English and      
 written work.The afternoons are given 
 over to topic,games,art and craft.On  
 Wednesday we go swimming at Spalding  
 pool.We have quite a lot of television
 programmes,and we use the radio and   
 tape recorders too.We have just bought
 an overhead projector which is very   
 useful.At the moment we have three    
 classes;one for reception and middle  
 infants,one for top infants and first 
 yearjuniors and one for 2nd,3rd and   
 4th year juniors.We also do science   
 and music and we put on plays.        </content>
