		<content>    School to my mind is the most      
 important part of your life.It is like
 building foundations for a house,build
 bad foundations and the house will    
 sink.I don't want to find myself in a 
 dole queue,so I try my best at my     
 school work.                          
   School can be a pain. You can get   
 judged unfairly by teachers who won't 
 listen to you and then you get        
 punished for something you didn't do. 
   Teachers tend to overload the work  
 and expect too much of you.You end up 
 doing too much work badly when you    
 could have done a small amount well.  
  More facilities in schools are needed
 desperately.In this area mixed schools
 seem to be favoured compared to single
 sex schools.Our school for example has
 very few P.E.facilities whilst most of
 the other secondary schools have      
 superb sports centres.                </content>
