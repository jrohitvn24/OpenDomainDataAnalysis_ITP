		<title>10SILVER PAINT AND LAQUER</title>
		<content>{KALON}  which   was   formerly  S.P.L.
 (Silver  paint and laquer  company) is
 just off the  Birstall  traffic lights
 going  towards  Huddersfield.  It  has
 been  a large  help in  the employment
 market  in  Batley  and  Birstall. The
 area  of  the  site  is  65000  square
 metres  and employs over 1000 workers.
 There  are  three  factories  owned by
 Mr. Silvers, { 1)   Old  Admiral  Mill
{2) S.P.L.} on George St. and{3) Kalon.
 S.P.L.  first started when Mr. Silvers
 came  out of the air force in 1947 and
 couldn't  find  any  other  work so he
 started  a  small  firm  of 10  people
 making   paint  on  Bradford  Road. He
 started  making  paint  because Batley
 and  Birstall  were textile  towns and
 that  was  dying out.  Originally  the
 paint was hand made but now everything
 was  automated.  All the firms data is
 now stored on computer.               </content>
