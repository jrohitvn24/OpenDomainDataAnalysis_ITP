		<title>04Village Life in Lyddington</title>
		<content> Village life in the eighties is       
 changing,from a mainly agricultural   
 based community to a commuter         
 dormitory, with inhabitants travelling
 as far as London for numerous trades  
 and professions.Cottages seem to fetch
 exhorbitant prices because the village
 has an attractive exclusiveness which 
 appeals.New houseowners have higher   
 expectations of country life than the 
 old style villager.They want stabling 
 and paddocks for their horses and     
 facilities for their children,the     
 conveniences of modern life,but the   
 seclusion and peace of a village.Most 
 people have a car and there is easy   
 access to the mainline stations and   
 motorways.Their lifestyle being mainly
 out of the village is one reason for  
 the reduction in community meetings.  
 Some are only weekend cottagers.
