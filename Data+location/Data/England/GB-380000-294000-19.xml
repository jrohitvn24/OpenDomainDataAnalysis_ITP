		<title>19LIVING IN THE SEISDON AREA</title>
		<content>   It is quite obvious that most of the
people  who live in this area do so    
from choice.   They enjoy the country  
way of life and do not hanker after the
bright lights of the town.   For them  
the possible inconveniences of life in 
the country are far outweighed by the  
beauty and spaciousness of the country-
side and the quieter pace of life.     
Many of them have fine gardens which   
bear witness to the owners' hard work  
and enthusiasm.                        
   For some there is great pride in    
their houses and a wonderful sense of  
continuity when they can say "my family
has lived in this house for            
generations".                          
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
