		<title>15A Day in the Life of Ruth</title>
		<content>   When I woke up at 7.30a.m. I thought
 it was going to rain. I had my        
 breakfast of cornflakes and I got     
 dressed at 8.0 and went to school. The
 whistle went at 8.56. We went into    
 Assembly and Mr. Withington read us a 
 story. In the classroom we had a      
 lesson about tesselations. Then we had
 playtime and I had a game of marbles. 
 Then we came in to do our creative    
 writing. We had to write about an old 
 person who had an accident. When we   
 had activities I chose collage boxes  
 to make pictures, and the phonic group
 had phonics. We had a quiz next and   
 then a story. When we went home I had 
 my tea and at 6.30p.m. I went to inter
 club and played rounders. I went home 
 and watched T.V. until I went to bed  
 at 9.0p.m.
