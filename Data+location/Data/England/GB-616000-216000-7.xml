		<title>07Wheat farming</title>
		<content>     Our block is mainly{arable        
{farmland,}the main crop being{wheat.  
     In spring the farmer ploughs the  
 fields. When he has finished he goes  
 over the field with a machine called a
{harrow.}It breaks up all the hard     
 lumps so that it is softer to plant   
 the wheat. After about three weeks you
 can see little plants.                
     The farmer uses a tractor with a  
{hoe.}It ploughs the field up gently   
 without hurting the wheat. On the end 
 of the tractor are little prongs which
 scrape the soil.                      
     When the wheat is green a tractor 
 comes along with a{pesticide spray    
 that kills insects.                   
     Later, when the wheat is ripe the 
 farmer uses his biggest machine, a    
{Combine Harvester.
