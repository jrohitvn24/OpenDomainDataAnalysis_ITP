		<title>01Stillingfleet-Kelfield Area</title>
		<content>  There are three villages in this area
 Stillingfleet, the smaller Kelfield   
 and Acaster Selby, a small widely     
 scattered hamlet.  It is a very quiet 
 and rural area with occasional        
 disturbance from nearby R.A.F. Church 
 Fenton.                               
                                       
{ The only industry is agriculture,    
{although the nearby developing Selby  
{coalfield is giving rise to fears of  
{subsidence.                           
{ It is not a smokeless zone.  The area
{has mains electricity and water but   
{no gas.                               
{                                      
{ There is one bus company operating in
{the area.  The buses are two-hourly   
{between York &amp; Selby, running between 
{the intervening villages, with some   
{extra buses in peak periods, but no   
{Sunday service. }                     </content>
