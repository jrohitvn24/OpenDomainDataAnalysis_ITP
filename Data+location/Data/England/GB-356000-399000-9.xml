		<content> In Ashton we have five free newspapers
 a week; the Wigan Reporter; The       
 Leader; Property Scene; Star Extra;   
 and the Winwick Reporter.             
                                       
 These newspapers tell you what is     
 happening, what is for sale and about 
 sport. They sometimes advertise jobs  
 and always advertise shops and firms. 
                                       
 The Property Scene shows houses for   
 sale and gives a brief description    
 about them.                           
                                       
 The Wigan Reporter has a lot of pages 
 about Wigan Football Club which is in 
 the Third Division.  It also tells you
 about Wigan Rugby League Football     
 Club, which is very good and has been 
 to Wembly Stadium recently.           
                                       
 A newspaper can be very {useful.}     </content>
