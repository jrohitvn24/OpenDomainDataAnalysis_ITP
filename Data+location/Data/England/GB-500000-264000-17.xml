		<title>17Melchbourne Mini-fete</title>
		<content> The fete was organised as a fund      
 raising event for the church.         
 It was held on a hot Saturday in July 
 and was attended by people from the   
 surrounding villages as well.         
 The venue was the beautiful garden of 
 Hillands Cottage, nexy door to the    
 Church. There was a variety of stalls 
 - plants, home produce, book stall,   
 white elephant and a bran tub, a great
 favourite with the children.          
 The competitions were also excellent -
 apple bobbing, skittles, guess the    
 weight of a delightful Hansel and     
 Gretel gingerbread house cake and     
 possibly the best of all, naming a    
 beautiful porcelain doll dressed in   
 blue satin and lace.(Victorian Style).
 Plenty of tea and cakes were consumed.
 The fete was enjoyed by all and raised
 Â£200 for the restoration fund.
