		<content>  We had a big partition to divide the 
 old school into two rooms for         
 Juniors,Seniors and Infants. We had an
 entrance door for girls and one for   
 boys.We had to go home for            
 dinners,there were no school dinners  
 then.We went to that school until we  
 left school at 14.                    
  My mother was a land girl in the     
 wartime and then she kept chickens for
 breeding.People who wanted to rear    
 chickens would come and buy a dozen   
 eggs from her.I have always loved     
 animals and one of my other jobs is   
 looking after other peoples dogs when 
 they go away.                         
   My main interest is football.I've   
 always loved football and supported   
 the village teams.
