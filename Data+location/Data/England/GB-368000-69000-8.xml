		<content> The Portland Museum building is in    
 three parts.  Originally a 17th       
 century cottage was donated to        
 Portland by Dr. Marie Stopes in 1929. 
 The thatched cottage is known locally 
 as Avice's Cottage as it was so named 
 by Thomas Hardy who describes it in   
 his novel The Well-Beloved. The New   
 Gallery is a recent addition          
 commissioned during the curatorship of
 Mr. Jack West.  The museum displays a 
 wealth of local artefacts and tells   
 the history of the Island in paintings
 and photographs.  The collection of   
 local shipwreck information is        
 extensively illustrated.  The museum  
 became part of the Weymouth and       
 Portland Museum Service in 1974 and   
 shares its curator with Weymouth      
 Museum.
