		<title>11BURGHLEY- HORSE TRIALS</title>
		<content> Scattered through the park are many   
 horse jumps used for the Burghley     
 horse trials 3 day event held in      
 September,which is attended by many   
 1st class riders and is very          
 important.One horse jump we saw was   
 made of logs,wire and rope.There were 
 two of them placed facing each other.A
 roadway passed between them 4m below. 
 Each jump was 1.5m high.The second one
 we saw was in the middle of a field.It
 was tied together by rope and wire.At 
 Burghley every year the horse trials  
 take place.They involve three events: 
 dressage,show jumping and cross       
 country.The dressage is marked on     
 style. The show jumps are about 5 feet
 high and form a very difficult        
 course.The cross country is great     
 fun.There are 34 jumps.They are very  
 different to the normal jumps you     
 would see.                            </content>
