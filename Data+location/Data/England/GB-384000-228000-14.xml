 meeting in September 1975. At first   
 there were only fourteen people.      
 In 1978 the Cub Scouts began Morris   
 dancing and bell ringing and made     
 their first appearance in the same    
 year. Mr. Cripps was the founder      
 scoutmaster, along with his wife,     
 until recently. Such youth groups find
 it difficult to find qualified        
 adult supervisors. Dave Fisher        
 organises the transport of{Apperley   
{Football Club}to and from their       
 matches and is also a qualified

 weekends at Apperley's own cricket    
 pitch. In June 1985 they held the     
 'Alternative Ashes' at which Bob      
 Willis and Mike Denness,formerly of   
 England, played against an Australian 
 cricket club which took back home the
