		<title>19PERTON POETRY</title>
		<content>About ten years ago Perton was just    
green fields and woodland. The         
machinery took over making a new area  
of houses and shops. More and more     
people came to live here and soon it   
was a noisy, cluttered development.    
Here is a poem which describes my      
feelings about it...                   
    The distant sounds of aeroplanes   
    Coming in to land on the busy      
    airfield                           
    The crushing noise of Bulldozers   
    Churning the soil slowly over      
    The machinery created a world      
    Of cluttered houses and streets    
    Cutting through the green fields   
    Destroying the peaceful woods      
    Bringing an atmosphere             
    Of noisy traffic,crowded shops.    
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
