10.45 Playtime,football or play indoors
11.00 Come inside for topic, science,  
bible or something else. It is quite   
hard.                                  
12.15 Lunch playtime. The whistle goes 
and we line up for lunch. Our lunch    
boxes are on a table, so we grab them  
and then sit down. I usually have a    
sausage roll, apple and biscuits or    
crisps. The school dinner people have  
something nice too, like fish fingers, 
chips and peas or salad. For pudding,  
fruit or yoghurt.Then football again.  
1.15 Line up and go in for reading.    
1.50 Apparatus in bare feet. The school
has got a wooden wall frame and some   
ropes. My favourite is climbing up and 
down the ropes.                        
2.45 Story time, then we go home.      
3.30 Watch  T.V. and have tea.         
8.30 Go to bed.                        </content>
