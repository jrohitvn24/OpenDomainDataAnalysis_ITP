		<content>{North Moreton} and South Moreton are  
two villages situated between the      
towns of  Didcot and Wallingford.      
The village is quite small comprising  
many 15 and 16th century houses and is 
very popular with commuters who travel 
to London via Didcot Railway station   
and its fast 125 train service. The    
village has 'The Bear' Public house.   
North Moreton Manor is recorded in the 
original Domesday Book but only the    
outline of the moat remains today. 'All
Saints' Church can have its origins    
traced back to Norman times and has    
been extended over the years. The tower
has a peal of bells going back to 1591.
