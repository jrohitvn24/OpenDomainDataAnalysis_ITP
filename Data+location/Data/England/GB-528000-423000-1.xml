 Winestead is part of the Parish of    
 Patrington, its boundary being just   
 past the garage.  It is a very rural  
 area being mainly farmland and        
 plantations.  There are few houses and
 new building is not allowed, only     
 extensions to existing properties.    
                                       
 Winestead is served by a garage, hotel
 and Church and also the Water         
 Authority pumping station. There are  
 no shops.                             
                                       
 There is one telephone kiosk and one  
 post box having two collections a day 
 and one delivery.  No public bus      
 service passes through Winestead      
 village.
