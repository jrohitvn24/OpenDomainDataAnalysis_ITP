		<title>09Legends Of Two Bridges</title>
		<content> One of the more modern legends of the 
 area must be that of the{Hairy Hands.}
 Between Postbridge and Two Bridges,   
 there were many incidents of          
 horse-drawn carriages running off the 
 road. The coachmen, when questioned,  
 stoutly maintained that a pair of     
 disembodied Hairy Hands had seized the
 reins and wrenched the coach off the  
 road: it was not only coaches, but    
 later motor vehicles as well.         
                                       
 Just after World War II the occupants 
 of a caravan had settled down for the 
 night near where the hands had struck:
 the husband went to sleep while the   
 wife remained up, writing. Suddenly   
 she experienced a cold eerie feeling  
 and saw two hairy hands at the window.
 She quickly made the sign of the      
 cross, and the hands were never seen  
 again.                                </content>
