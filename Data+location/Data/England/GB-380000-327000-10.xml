		<title>10Attitudes in Eccleshall</title>
		<content> Eccleshall is a friendly community,   
 although attitudes differ widely. The 
 older inhabitants seem happy to leave 
 things as they are, whereas younger   
 people are aware of the need for      
 better facilities, such as a sports   
 hall or leisure centre, to provide a  
 larger meeting-place. There is a      
 strong community spirit, common to all
 ages, and the majority are against the
 impending closure of one of the       
 schools. All agree that shopping fac- 
 ilities are very good and shopkeepers 
 very helpful, though some feel that   
 Eccleshall has somewhat lost its char-
 acter with the closure of the cattle  
 market and the influx of commuters.   
 Most residents are progressive and    
 positive in their ideas for improving 
 an already very popular small town.
