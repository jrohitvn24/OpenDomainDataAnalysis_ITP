		<content>    The{Nottinghamshire police}travel  
 around the area using{patrol cars,    
 although fortunately heavy policing is
 not necessary locally. The majority of
 the crime concerns{poaching}as the    
 many wooded sites give ideal          
 conditions and opportunities for this 
 type of theft.                        
    However there has been{stealing    
 from the{church in Ossington}in recent
 months. Firstly the{ecclesiastical    
{silver}was taken, then later{wooden   
{chests}disappeared from the church    
 along with the{new vacuum cleaner.    
    There is also occasional pilfering 
 from farmyards and outbuildings but   
 thankfully these are isolated         
 incidents.                            
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
