		<content> Branston,a one time small country     
 village in the heart of Lincolnshire  
 is situated 5 miles from Lincoln.It   
 has always been a farming area. Since 
 the war though Branston has grown as  
 people have moved into the area to    
 seek work in Lincoln. Branston now has
 3 schools,4 housing estates and over  
 3000 people.For the survey,we went to 
 places of interest in Branston. We    
 visited Patrick Dean Ltd, which is a  
 local farming company,the Old Hall and
 the three schools.We spoke to people  
 in Branston interviewing them on a    
 wide variety of subjects including    
 religion and housing.Some people      
 visited the church which is part      
 Saxon,and spoke to the vicar.We       
 interviewed people about their jobs.We
 also visited our parish council and   
 wrote to our local M.P .
