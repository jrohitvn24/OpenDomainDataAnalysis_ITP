		<title>01Village Green,Ravensthorpe</title>
		<content>Ravensthorpe's Village Green is made   
especially attractive by 2 large beech 
trees  The larger one was planted in   
l897 for Queen Victoria's Diamond      
Jubilee, the smaller in l935 for King  
George V's Silver Jubilee and the      
little red oak on the bottom green was 
planted for the presentQueen Elizabeth 
ll's silver in l977.All 3 have coins   
of the year in bottles at the roots,   
but please do not start digging - they 
are of little value now! The trees     
are much prized and in good condition. 
The Green is sometimes used for social 
activities.Occasionally a travelling   
theatre group set up here and give an  
open air performance.During the Wool   
Festival the coconut shy was on one    
side, while a large crowd watched the  
Morris Dancers on the other.The Green  
is well cared for and we can take some 
pride in our surroundings.             </content>
