		<title>12Health care in Lorton</title>
		<content> All the statutory provisions such as  
 home helps, health visitors and home  
 nursing are available. The nearest    
 doctors, dentists and chemists are in 
 Cockermouth - 4 miles away. A visit to
 a doctor's surgery could be made by   
 the one bus a week but people with    
 cars help those without for this and  
 for visits to hospitals. Cockermouth  
 has a much valued Cottage Hospital    
 where emergency treatment is          
 available. The hospital at Whitehaven 
 - 18 miles away treats most cases and 
 all hospital births. Antenatal care is
 available at a clinic in Cockermouth  
 and from some G.P.'s. A private       
 hospital has recently opened in       
 Workington. The infirm elderly go to  
 sheltered accommodation in Cockermouth
 or to the geriatric ward of the       
 Cottage Hospital.
