		<content>{Brinsley was mentioned in the original
 Domesday Book where it was called     
 Brunsley.Charles the Second hid in    
 Brinsley Hall which is now a farm.The 
 houses in Brinsley were built from    
 bricks made at the local brickyard    
 which closed down in 1830.            
 The post office in Brinsley was owned 
 by D.H.Lawrences' Uncle George.In the 
 second world war 225 children were    
 evacuated to the village.             
 The original school in Brinsley had   
 no toilets and no running water.Also  
 they had only one room where classes  
 were taken but they split the room in 
 1_5 standards. 100 years ago there    
 were no buses or cars to take you     
 places so you had to walk 2 miles to  
 the nearest steam train station.In    
 Brinsley there were no lights until   
 1908.The first sewage works was built 
 in 1906.                              </content>
