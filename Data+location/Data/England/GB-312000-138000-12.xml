		<content> If you are lucky you may see {Red Deer
  feeding in the early morning or late 
 evening .During the day they rest in  
 the bracken. Near Triscombe you may   
 find the {White Hind}.In Autumn at    
 rutting time the {Stag} begins to     
 roar. Many of the {Hill Ponies} were  
 taken off  this year but there are    
 still two small groups living wild . {
{Foxes}are around and can be seen in   
 day light near picnic places. The cubs
 are very active in May and June. {    
{Rabbits} are numerous again and the   
 occasional {Brown Hare} lollops over  
 the lower slopes.{Grey Squirrels} are 
 in all the wooded  combes constantly  
 dashing from tree to tree. Dusk is the
 time most likely for sighting {Badgers
 but{usually}you only see {evidence}of 
 activity out side his sett.
