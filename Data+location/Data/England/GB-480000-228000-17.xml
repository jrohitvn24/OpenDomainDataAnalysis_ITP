 AGNES FITZGERALD TO HOLD A WEDNESDAY  
 MARKET IN 1242.MURSLEY LIES BETWEEN   
 BUCKINGHAM AND DUNSTABLE AND SO WOULD 
 HAVE BEEN A ROUTE FOR TRAVELLERS ON   
 THEIR WAY TO LONDON.THEY WERE ALSO    
 GRANTED A CHARTER FOR A THREE DAY FAIR
 TO BE HELD EVERY YEAR ON THE FEAST OF 
 THE VIRGIN MARY(7TH,8TH,9TH SEPTEMBER)

 LOCAL PEOPLE.                         
{SIR JOHN FORTESCUE.}IN 1570 THE MANOR
