		<content> The Gloucester Road, which goes past  
 Mr. Finch's house, was the only road. 
 It went from Gloucester to Stow-on-the
 Wold.                                 
   In 1852,a new road was built.It was 
 from Dowdeswell to the reservoir.It   
 came up and joined the road by        
 Sandywell Lane.The first one was on   
 the left hand side of the main        
 road(A40).                            
   The construction firm went bankrupt 
 when the railway got to the Royal Oak 
 Inn.The next railway came on the left 
 hand side of Tunnel Hill.It was a     
 single line.It was then increased to  
 double lines.Another line went to     
 Cirencester.Two stations were         
 completed,each with a railway yard    
 which contained coal and goods.       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
