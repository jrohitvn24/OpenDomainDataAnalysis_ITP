		<title>01Esholt and Thackley</title>
		<content> There is little that is special about 
 this area,one of the prettiest in West
 Yorkshire,but still close to urban    
 squalour and sprawl.Its most famous   
 son was{Professor Joseph Wright,}a    
 pioneer linguist.The area is locally  
 notorious for the{Esholt sewage works 
 and their smell,and for the TV series 
{Emmerdale Farm.}Thackley is the only  
 settlement of any size,the area serves
 as a lung for the many small towns    
 which surround it.One{railway line    
 through the area has already gone,and 
 the other two are under threat.The    
{canal}survives only as a picturesque  
 tourist route,where once it brought   
 prosperity to the area.The{main road  
 between Leeds and Airedale runs       
 through Thackley,and may soon be      
 bypassed.The area seems to be on the  
 edge of things,it's quiet and peaceful
 and the inhabitants like it that way. </content>
