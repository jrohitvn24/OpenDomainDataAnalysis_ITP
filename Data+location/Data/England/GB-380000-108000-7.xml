		<content> The school was built in 1873 and is   
 situated in the middle of the village.
 On February 3rd,1942, a fire broke out
 in the school and destroyed the main  
 room in the building. The building was
 reconstructed,and then, in 1978, a    
 major rebuilding programme took place,
 enlarging the school and providing it 
 with a modern hall and a new infant   
 teaching area.  The older part of the 
 school was refurbished, and this has  
 provided the village with an extremely
 well-equipped school with its own     
 playing field and playground.         
                                       
 At present, the school is a primary   
 school and children from 5 years to 11
 years are taught by two teachers with 
 some part-time help. There are 46     
 children at the school at present, and
 these numbers are likely to remain    
 fairly stable for the next few years. </content>
