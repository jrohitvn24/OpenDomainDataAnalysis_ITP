		<content> Interview with Herrol (Bomber) Graham,
 British and European Middleweight     
 Champion.                             
{Were you born in Sheffield?}          
 No, I was born in Nottingham on the   
 13th of September,1959.  That makes me
 25.  I'm getting on!                  
{How old were you when you first       
{started boxing?}                      
 I was between 8 and 9. I was on a pair
 of roller skates in Faraday Road,     
 Nottingham.  There were 2 boys with   
 their heads out of the window shouting
 abuse at me and because I was a black 
 boy they called me "Blackie".  I hated
 it.  Then they said, "If you come up  
 here we'll beat you up."  Like a fool 
 I did.  I found that I enjoyed        
 controlled violence and ever since    
 then I've never looked back.
