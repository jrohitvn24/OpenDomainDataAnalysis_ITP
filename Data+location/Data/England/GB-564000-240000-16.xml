		<content>{Boblow house}is about 460 years       
 old.There is a pond with a rowing boat
 on it.The pond used to go out into    
 the field in a triangle and they used 
 to keep the livestock in it.There are 
 three chimneys at one end and two at  
 the other. The centre one of the three
 was put on for decoration.In the      
 chimneys there are windows and        
 surprisingly there are rooms behind   
 them. Inside at each end of the house,
 there's a fireplace.In the middle     
 there's a fireplace for cooking ,which
 is about 3 metres wide.In one of the  
 bedrooms there's a cupboard with a    
 smaller cupboard in it. There are     
 three theories about the small        
 cupboard, 1. They used to keep their  
{wigs}in it 2.They used to keep{salt}in
 it 3. It was{a priest hole,}and the   
 cupboard was for the bread and wine.  
 The house was once a hunting lodge.   </content>
