		<content>  Most people say that they are not    
 religious. Most people do not attend a
 church but if asked their religion    
 most say that they are Church of      
 England.                              
  In our town there are many different 
 churches and chapels - most of them   
 are just over one hundred years old.  
 The Roman Catholic Church is in the   
 old (1856) Town Hall Building. The    
 churches are not very well supported  
 except at Christmas, Easter and for   
 weddings and funerals. The Christian  
 Evangelical Fellowship Group seems to 
 be developing a growing following.
