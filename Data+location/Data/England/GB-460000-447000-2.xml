		<content>   Old Fulford consisted of two        
 parishes, Gate Fulford and Water      
 Fulford, but the boundaries of the two
 are not clear.                        
   Both have their origins before the  
 Norman Conquest though it is not clear
 exactly when.                         
   Both parishes centred on their      
 manors which probably date back to    
 late Anglo-Saxon times. Indeed the    
 parish church of St. Oswald ( Gate    
 Fulford ) was dedicated to Oswald the 
 Christian king of Northumbria who was 
 killed in battle in 642.              
   In 1078 William I granted both of   
 the manors to two of his loyal        
 followers whose descendants           
 remained for several centuries.
