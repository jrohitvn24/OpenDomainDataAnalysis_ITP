		<content> In our small survey of those          
 activities that could be best         
 described as entertainment the most   
 popular was sport.This was usually    
 seen on television ,though many did   
 visit local football and rugby        
 clubs.The most popular entertainment  
 was to visit "discos" in the local    
 villages.This was especially popular  
 with the girls in our sample.Other    
 entertainments included,visits to     
 various places of interest ,such as   
 Alton Towers or safari parks.Places   
 such as stately Homes,or historic     
 buildings were of some interest but   
 only to a minority.However much       
 entertainment centred around the home 
 and the family,whether it be games    
 or television.
