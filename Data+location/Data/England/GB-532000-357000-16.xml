		<content> Playground games have got more modern 
 over the years.The main game is       
 football.There are eleven players in a
 football team.There is a goalie.He is 
 a person who saves the ball from      
 getting past him using his hands and  
 feet.The defenders are people that    
 just use their feet to kick the ball  
 away from the goal.The rest of the    
 players pass the ball to each other   
 and try to get the ball past the other
 players to score a goal.              
 A game we play is called Fox and      
 Hounds.You need a base, and five      
 people to be hounds . The people who  
 are hounds have to catch the foxes.If 
 they do they have to count to ten.    
 After that if the fox has not got away
 he's a hound and the person who caught
 him becomes a fox and the game goes   
 on.
