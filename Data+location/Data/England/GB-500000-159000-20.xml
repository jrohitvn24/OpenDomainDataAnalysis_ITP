		<content>  The south east section of the area is
 mainly residential with substantial   
 detached houses in large gardens. Some
 of these have been demolished and the 
 land used to build three or four      
 smaller houses.The roads, many of them
 private, are quiet and tree-lined.    
  This area is bordered by the railway 
 line and golf course to the north and 
 by Pyrford Common to the South.       
  The common land is mainly open scrub 
 containing a variety of shrubs and    
 wild flowers. There are foot and      
 bridle paths through the Common which 
 are well used.                        
  The areas of scattered woodland      
 contain both deciduous and coniferous 
 trees.                                
  Pyrford has a Cricket Club, a        
 Gymnastic Club to which children from 
 the whole area come and a very popular
 annual Flower Show.                   </content>
