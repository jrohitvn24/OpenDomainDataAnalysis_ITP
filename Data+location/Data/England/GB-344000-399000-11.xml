		<content> The police in Rainford are part of the
 Merseyside force.They operate from a  
 small station in Church Road.This     
 station is only open on a part-time   
 basis.The village is policed by patrol
 cars supplemented by the traffic      
 division and by officers on the       
 beat.The only time you see a lot of   
 police at any one time is when a      
 special event is taking place.        
 The fire station in Rainford is       
 situated in Crosspit Lane.The station 
 has one engine.The station is manned  
 by part-time retained firemen who have
 other jobs and are alerted by radio   
 pagers when they are needed.          
 There is no ambulance station in      
 Rainford.In an emergency a vehicle    
 would be dispatched from St.Helens    
 Hospital.
