		<title>12DEVELOPMENT IN CHERRY WALK</title>
		<content> Developers who want to demolish two   
 imposing houses on land near Cherry   
 Walk,High Salvington,and replacs them 
 with a housing estate,have taken their
 plan to appeal.                       
 Hadley and Appledore are two large    
 detatched houses set in more than     
 three acres of attractive gardens.    
 A Surrey building company applied to  
 knock them down and put up 22         
 two-storey detatched houses with      
 garages.The scheme aroused a storm of 
 protest from residents of the area,   
 especially those around West Way,     
 which would become the access road for
 the new estate.                       
 Worthing Borough Council planners     
 refused permission because they felt  
 the building plan was too             
 intensive,but have warned that they   
 would not be able to resist a more    
 modest application.                   </content>
