		<content> The {energy}resources available to the
 villages are much as would be         
 expected.All homes have{electricty}for
 lighting.Many people cook with        
 electricty and heat their homes.Many  
 new homes have{oil}fired central      
 heating.There is no gas within the    
 village.There is a main{gas}pipe line 
 along the Exeter to Barnstaple road   
 but no pipe for gas into the          
 village.To over come the absence of   
 north sea gas some people heat their  
 homes and cook by {calor gas}which is 
 kept in a tank in the garden .Many    
 people use {soild fuels}either coal or
 wood for heating and for cooking.In   
 the past a source of energy was{water}
 and there is a water wheel at the     
 bottom of the village but is not in   
 use
