		<content>      The children of the village have 
 the opportunity to belong to several  
 youth organisations. Foremost of which
 are the Scouting organisations.       
    The Brownies, for girls upto 10,   
 have regular meetings in the Parish   
 hall. It is popular with First School 
 children, though not all of them take 
 up the opportunity to become Girl     
 Guides.                               
   The boy's equivalent is the Cub     
 Scouts. This too holds its meetings   
 once a week in the Parish Hall.Again  
 this is popular with the young boys,  
 more of whom stay on to become Scouts.
