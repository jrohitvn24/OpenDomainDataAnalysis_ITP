		<content> Pupils from Sutton Benger School      
 interviewed the village's oldest      
 inhabitant, Mr Ernest Sharps, age 95, 
 about his early memories.             
 He spent his childhood in Seagry,     
 which was part of the same parish as  
 Sutton Benger before the motorway     
 split the area in 1970.               
 He remembers, at the age of 10,       
 watching the Bath passenger coach     
 changing horses in Sutton Benger High 
 Street. It had liveried coachmen who  
 sounded post horns.                   
 At the turn of the century he tolled  
 the church bell at the local memorial 
 service on Queen Victoria's death.    
 As a 14 year old he went to work on a 
 farm in Minety, earning 14s 6d per    
 week.                                 
 He returned to Sutton Benger to farm  
 in 1951, but lost some of his land    
 when the M4 motorway was built.       </content>
