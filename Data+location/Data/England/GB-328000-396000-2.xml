{Recreation:The Marina                 
{   The Marina was opened by Princess  
{Anne and covers three hundred         
{acres,seventy six of which are taken  
{up by the actual lake which is half   
{sea water and half fresh water. It is 
{artificially built off the Mersey     
{Estuary with 2 hard concrete jetties. 
{   Some of the Marina facilities      
{include Sailing Schools for the public
{and a Scout and Guide Club which is   
{very profitable and valuable to the   
{Marina.The Marina is open at the same 
{hours as the Marine Park i.e.eight    
{o'clock in the morning until one hour 
{before sunset.There are 125 members of
{the Sailing Club and the average age  
{is thirty years.Near the lake is a    
{shop called Ship Shape and the owner  
{gives a lot of advice to beginners.   </content>
