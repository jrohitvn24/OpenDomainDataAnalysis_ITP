		<title>17Flowers in the Hexton Area</title>
		<content>                                       
 Hexton is on the {North East}edge of  
 the {Chiltern Hills }and the soil is  
 very chalky. In May and June yellow   
 cowslips and dandelions are the most  
 common flowers and we also found      
 hawthorn, bugloss, violets,           
 buttercups, celandines and cow        
 parsley. Cowslips are rare flowers and
 like chalky soil. That is why there   
 are lots growing in the Hexton Chalk  
 Pit.                                  
                                       
 The{Chalk Pit}is a{Nature Reserve}and 
 the flowers there are specially       
 protected so they will not become     
 extinct. In the summer the very rare  
{Pyramid}and{Bee Orchids }also grow    
 there.                                
                                       
 We found many flowers when we were    
 exploring our area.                   </content>
