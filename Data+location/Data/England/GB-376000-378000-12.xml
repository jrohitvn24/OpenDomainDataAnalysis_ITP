 by Mr. R.O.Leycester.                 
      The Hall has a wooden frame and  
 walls, with a tiled roof.  It has been
 extended over the years and now houses
 the working Men's Club which has a    
 membership of 400.  The Club has a    
 bar, and snooker,darts and bowls are  
 among the games played.

 social life in Mobberley and provides 
 facilities for dances, social events, 
 Churchwomen's Fellowship, Parish      
 meetings and a playgroup.  The Hall is
 managed by a committee which,         
 comprises members of local            
 organisations.                        </content>
