Driving around the council estate near 
Pampisford Road was surprising to me   
because the  houses are nearly         
identical. They are semi-detached or   
in fours, and all the same colours,    
either cream, green or brown.          
Garages are not included with the      
house, so cars have to park on the     
roads or pavements.                    
The gardens are cramped and squashed   
up.                                    
There are a lot of roads which all look
the same.  We got lost.  There is a    
huge park nearby but there is nothing  
much in it.  It is used for football   
in the winter, but there was nobody    
there when we was there.  Some people  
use it to walk their dogs.
