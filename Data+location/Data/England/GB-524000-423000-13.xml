		<title>13MARKET GARDENING</title>
		<content> Since the mid nineteenth century there
 has been a growing development of     
 market gardening (cultivation of fruit
 and vegetables in controlled          
 conditions on green houses) these are 
 to the east and west of Keyingham.    
 They were introduced by Dutch families
 coming to live here, and have         
 developed into large businesses       
 covering many acres.  The main crop os
 tomatoes and produce is speedily      
 transported by road to the nearest    
 city for distribution. They also      
 provide employment for the area       
 although this tends to be seasonal.
