		<content> Our area includes part of Penzance,the
 whole of Newlyn. The villages of Paul 
 and Tredavoe.                         
 The coastline is mainly of rock and   
 pebble and from the beaches you can   
 see St.Michaels Mount and across to   
 the Lizard Peninsula .                
 Locals say that when the Lizard is    
 clearly defined it will rain.         
 Penlee Quarry is a conspicuous sight  
 in Mounts Bay between Newlyn and      
 Mousehole and at Wherry town just over
 a hundred years ago there was a mine  
 (The Wherry)operating actually in the 
 sea,a few hundred yards off the       
 present promenade.                    
 The rocks on which it was built can   
 still be seen at low tide.
