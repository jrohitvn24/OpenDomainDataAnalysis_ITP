		<content>   Hayes has two main public houses and
 both focus on food.  The most         
 historical is the George, which still 
 has stable doors behind it. It        
 probably takes its name from George   
 111. In the old days stocks stood     
 outside. Today it is a Berni Steak    
 House. We learnt that its busiest     
 lunchtimes were on Wednesdays and     
 Sundays. Saturday was the busiest     
 evening.                              
   The most popular meal is steak,     
 french fries and salad with           
 strawberries.  About 1800 meals are   
 served a week. 124 people can be      
 seated in the restaurants. There are  
 heat detectors against fire, and there
 is a fire drill. 75 people work in the
 George, 10 chefs, a manager and 2     
 assistant managers are full time, the 
 rest are part-time. 95% of the people 
 who come in are diners.               </content>
