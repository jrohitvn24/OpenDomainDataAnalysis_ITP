		<title>13Watford's Housing.</title>
		<content>In the Holy Rood area there are many   
types of housing. The different houses 
around are mostly semi-detached,       
terraced and detached. Some of the     
detached are very big and a lot sell   
for 90,000 or more.  The new M25 has   
made Watford a very popular place to   
live. Also Watford railway Junction is 
a mainline railway station with fast   
trains to London. Some of the old      
lodges from the big Estates are still  
used-the Grove and Russells House are  
near Holy Rood School. Also next to    
the school are Council Houses for      
Policemen and Firemen. An average      
family house has 3 bedrooms, a         
kitchen, a dining room, a living room, 
a bathroom, toilet and garden. There   
are also flats and bungalows close to  
the school. Watford Council owns many  
houses, the rest are private.
