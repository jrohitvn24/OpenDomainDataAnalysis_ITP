		<title>17BROADWELL MANOR</title>
		<content>  There has been a manor house on this 
 site since the 10th century. The      
 present house, with 25 rooms, was     
 substantially rebuilt in 1757 in the  
 Classical Early Georgian style        
 following a fire which destroyed most 
 of the Jacobean house of which only   
 the west wing survives. It was sited  
 by the spring from which the village  
 derives its name. There is still a    
 well in the cellars. The extensive    
 outbuildings include the original     
 Tudor brew-house and a recently       
 restored stable yard. There are many  
 fine old trees in the grounds with    
 formal lawns, a newly created herb    
 garden, an old walled vegetable garden
 and paddocks. The present owners have 
 lived there for 15 years and love its 
 elegant Georgian proportions but find 
 it hard to run and especially to heat 
 in the winter!                        </content>
