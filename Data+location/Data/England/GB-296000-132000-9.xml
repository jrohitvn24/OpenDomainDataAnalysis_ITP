		<content> There are two bells still in the bell 
 tower and we were delighted to find   
 that we could play the harmonium since
 it was not locked!                    
 In the last month there have been six 
 visitors from the surrounding counties
 and the visitors book is now full,    
 they will need a new one!             
 The most recent visitor was a lady who
 came on 2nd July. She was married here
 in 1935 and records that she always   
 loved the church.
