		<title>13SHEBBEAR MEDICAL CENTRE</title>
		<content> The Centre was opened in 1975. There  
 are two doctors, two nurses, one      
 secretary, two receptionists /        
 dispensers, a Health visitor and a    
 district nurse and midwife. The Centre
 is open from 9 to 12 and 2 to 4 each  
 day except Tuesdays, later when there 
 are surgeries. These are 9-10 or 5-6  
 on most days. Patients' records are   
 computerised. A second computer prints
 out prescriptions (which are dispensed
 at the Centre) and reorders medicines.
 There are 1800 patients, including 400
 boys from Shebbear College. About 30  
 patients come to surgery daily.       
 Doctors can be contacted anywhere by  
 the centre as they carry a "bleeper"  
 with them. Emergencies average 1      
 per week, mainly accidents at farms   
 and sawmills.
