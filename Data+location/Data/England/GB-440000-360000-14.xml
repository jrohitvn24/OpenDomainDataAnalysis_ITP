		<title>14THE GUIDES IN TIBSHELF</title>
		<content> On a Monday every week I go to Guides 
 with my friends, Joanne, Helen &amp; Lisa.
 We pay weekly subs of 25p and then we 
 do all sorts of things.               
 I used to be in Bluetit patrol but I  
 am now in Robins. As I heve only      
 recently joined Guides, I haven't got 
 many badges yet. I have got my Yellow 
 Point Trefoil and I have passed my    
 Hostess, Sportswoman and Homemaker    
 badges. I am going to work for six    
 more badges during the summer holiday.
 Most of our Guides are going to the   
 big Jamboree in Chatsworth Park where 
 we shall meet other Guides from all   
 over England and from other countries 
 as well. Some Guides from Gibraltar   
 are coming to stay with the Guides in 
 Tibshelf. I am going to look after two
 of them and I have had letters from   
 them already.
