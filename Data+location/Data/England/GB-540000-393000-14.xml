 THIS IS AN ACCOUNT ABOUT THE WILDLIFE 
 IN THE AREA.THE LOCAL ENVIROMENT HAS  
 MANY BIRD RESIDENT AREA'S.FOR HERE IS 
 AN EXAMPLE OF A BIRD WHICH SPENDS ITS 
 LIFE ON A RISTRICKED AREA.THIS BIRD IS
 A COOT.THE COOT LIVES ON PONDS AND    
 LAKES.HERE WE CAN RECOGNISE IT BY ITS 
 RED EYE AND WHITE BILL.ON THE TOP OF  
 THE BILL THERE IS A SHIELD WHICH ALSO 
 IS WHITE.THE COOT FEEDS ON A RANGE OF 
 WATER WEED AND SOME KINDS OF FISH FRY.
 THE ANIMAL POPULATION IS QUITE HIGH.  
 THIS IS BECAUSE THE HABITATS ARE      
 NUMEROUS.FOR EXAPLE THE SKYLARK       
 CHOOSES THE FIELD FOR ITS NESTS.THE   
 FARMERS TRAP AND SHOOTS ANIMALS FOR   
 SPORT.THERE IS ALSO A HELP FOR THE    
 ANIMALS.THE HELP IS A NATURE RESERVE
