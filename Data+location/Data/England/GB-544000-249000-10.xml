 Dr.Hopper's stables from 6 weeks-1    
 year and then they go to some racing  
 stables.The horses are worth          
 Â£5000-80000 and they all come from    
 Newmarket.Mr. Cliff Woof, Mr. Barney  
 Cerley and Mr. O'Callaghan own the    
 horses and they also train them.      
    The typical day for a trainer is in
 the morning he cleans the stables     
 out,brushes the horses over,exercises 
 them and feeds them.In the evenings he
 does the same he does not exercise    
 them.
