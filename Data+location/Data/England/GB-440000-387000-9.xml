		<title>09ROADWORKS ON THE M1 MOTORWAY</title>
		<content>    In{June}and{July 1985}there were   
 major roadworks taking place on the   
 motorway between{Catcliffe}and{       
{Tinsley. }The rush-hour traffic was   
 often slowed in{jams,}but these were  
 better than having the motorway closed
 completely.                           
    The{major repairs}were to the{     
{southbound}lanes. Only the third lane 
 was left open but more vehicles       
 travelling{south}were allowed to cross
 into the{northbound}carriageway and   
 use the third lane there. This meant  
 that traffic travelling{north}was left
 using the{hard shoulder and slow lane.
    Lines of{red and white 'cones'}    
 separated the traffic moving in       
 opposite directions.                  
    A temporary speed limit of{50 miles
{per hour}was advised but many cars    
 appeared to take no notice of it!
