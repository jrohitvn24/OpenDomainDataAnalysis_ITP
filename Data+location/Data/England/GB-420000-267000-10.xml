		<title>10TRANSPORT IN A RURAL AREA</title>
		<content>The main means of transport in our area
was the privately owned vehicle.       
The only other means of transport was  
by bus.                                
The canal was in use, but on the survey
day we did not see any boats or barges.
The canal tunnel goes right under the  
village of Shrewley Common.            
The main fear of people in the surr-   
ounding area is the building of a      
motorway. Public opinion differs to    
whether it should be built.It would    
change the life of a quiet rural area. 
The speed limit in the villages in our 
area is 30 MPH, because of this most   
people by-pass the villages by going   
on the faster main road. Not many      
vehicles go through the villages.      
Public Transport can be described as   
lacking. All of the areas we visited   
had little or no public transport.Row- 
ington had just 2 buses per week.      </content>
