		<title>05GROBY -WHAT A NAME!</title>
		<content>   {Groby}is a funny word especially   
 when you realise that it's pronounced 
 GROOBY-very confusing!                
 It started as {Grobi}in the original  
 Domesday Book,but by the twelfth      
 century had become {Groubi}and then   
{Groebi}.However in 1279{Groby}appeared
 and nothing much changed until 1564   
 when it was known as{Growbye}.Only    
 twelve years after that it had become 
{Groobye}but then through most of the  
 17th century{Groby}came back into     
 fashion.In 1692 it briefly reverted to
{Groobye}before becoming{Groby}for most
 of the 18th century.The 19th century  
 was totally dominated by yet another  
 version{Grooby}and this was used on   
 the first Ordnace Survey Maps of 1835.
 Here we are back to the present with {
{Groby}pronounced GROOBY.
