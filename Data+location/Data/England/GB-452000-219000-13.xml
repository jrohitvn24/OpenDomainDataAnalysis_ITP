		<title>13Footpaths at Weston</title>
		<content>This is essentially a country area,most
of which was once part of Kirtlington  
Park and as such was criss-crossed by  
footpaths. There are now 11 footpaths  
in the area, the most important of     
which is a section of the Oxfordshire  
Way which cuts the area east to west.  
This is frequently chosen as the path  
to follow by the long distance         
ramblers.
