 I make my way to the  kitchen, boil an
 egg for{breakfast}and I clean my teeth
 with ultra-bright toothpaste.At 9.00 I
 watch T.V. then I get  dressed. I call
 for my friend and we cycle to the play
 area to make dens out of straw.       
   I go home at 12.00 to have my{dinner
 which is  usually something  on toast.
 After dinner I go back to the playarea
 to have a game of scat(hide and seek).
