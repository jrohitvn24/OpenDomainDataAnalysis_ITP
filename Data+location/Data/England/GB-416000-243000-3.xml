		<title>03Milk Production  Mickleton</title>
		<content> On average each of Mr Hoggin's cows   
 produces 5500kg (1200galls) of milk in
 each lactation period.He is one of    
 Mickleton's milkmen and delivers milk 
 in the village.He charges 23 pence a  
 pint retail,or is paid 15 pence a     
 litre wholesale when he sells it to   
 the Milk Marketing Board.The milk he  
 sells does not have to be pasteurised.
 Sometimes a cow might get mastitis.   
 This is treated with anti-biotics.The 
 milk from an infected cow is no good  
 for cheese-making because the helpful 
 bacteria are killed off.              
 Mr Hoggins has three tractors on his  
 farm.Apart from himself,he employs one
 full-time and one part-time worker.   
 The farmhouse is almost in the middle 
 of the village and is built of the    
 local limestone.
