		<title>06Cattle on Brizes Lodge Farm</title>
		<content>                                       
Some of Brizes Lodge fields are rough  
grazing and they have cattle in them.  
The cattle come from Crawley at two    
months old. Some are Hereford calves,  
which have brown bodies and white      
faces. Others are crossed between a    
Hereford bull and a black and white    
Friesan cow. The calves will have a    
brown or a black body and always a     
white face.                            
The calves are looked after until they 
are two years old and then go back to a
Crawley farm to have calves of their   
own.                                   
Cows will not graze if there is too    
much Yorkshire fog grass, which cows   
don't like in the field they are in.   
In some places there are patches of    
long grass. The cow pats make the      
grass grow longer.
