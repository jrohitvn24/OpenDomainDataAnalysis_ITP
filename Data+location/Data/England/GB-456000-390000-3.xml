		<content>{Lord Scarbrough}owns the hall.It was  
 built in the 1920's over the site of a
 large house.The property was designed 
 by{James Paine}and built in magnesium 
 limestone.This was quarried nearby.   
 Sulpher dioxide from Sheffield and    
 Rotherham dissolves the stone.As the  
 building is a grade 1 listed building,
 the owner has a legal obligation to   
 keep the outside wall maintained.In   
 April 1985 urns,made of fibre glass,  
 were placed on the balustrade.They are
 a copy of Paine's original engraving. 
{Inside,}the largest room has an 18th  
 century ceiling.It was redecorated 5  
 years ago.The 8 spare bedrooms are    
 used annually by up to 130 guests.Lord
 Scarbrough{employs,}for the hall,a    
 butler,a cook,4 daily helpers,a full  
 time and a part_time gardener.Before  
 the last World War staff for the hall 
 numbered 29.                          </content>
