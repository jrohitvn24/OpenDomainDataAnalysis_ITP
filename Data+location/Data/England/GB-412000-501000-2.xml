		<content>  Mr Carter owns a seven acre caravan  
 site which consists of 100 permanent  
 caravans. It started in 1946.         
  People can bring their own tents and 
 caravans sometimes for holidays or    
 sometimes just for weekends, and you  
 can bring pets.                       
  There is an adventure playground for 
 children, a laundry and a games room  
 that has things like table tennis.    
 There are showers but no phones.      
  They have a shop which is open 9.00am
 to 8.00pm. It sells groceries, ice    
 cream, sweets and toys, but the people
 have to bring their own food.         
  There are 6 and 8 berth caravans,    
 and most of them have electricity. The
 8 berth caravans are 28 feet long and 
 have a dining area, lounge, 2 bunks   
 and 2 double beds.                    
  This caravan site helps to maintain  
 the tourist industry in this area.    </content>
