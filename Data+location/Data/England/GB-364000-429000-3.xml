		<title>03Playground Games in Mellor.</title>
		<content> Our playground games vary according to
 the weather.The game I play is        
 pirates.It is a sort of tig game and  
 you have to have three people or more 
 to play                               
 British Buldog is all about dodging.  
 Whoever he calls out,runs ,and the    
 person who is on must try and catch   
 them before they reach the other side.
 People get hurt but if you are cold it
 soon gets you warmed up and tired.    
 I play Kings, Queens and Jacks.King   
 means running, Queen means skipping   
 and Jack means hopping. Sometimes we  
 keep falling when we run and hop.     
 Rasberry, Strawberry,Apple jam tart,  
 Tell me the name of your sweet heart? 
 ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ.           
 Whichever letter you land on, you     
 think of a boy's name beginning with  
 that letter.I love singing skipping   
 rhymes.                               </content>
