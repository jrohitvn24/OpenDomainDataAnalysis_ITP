		<content>     Besides excellent road links with 
 nearby towns and its proximity to the 
 M6 Motorway,Sandbach and Elworth are  
 well-served by a good rail link.      
     The village of Elworth has its own
 railway station.This lies on the main 
 Manchester to Crewe line and is,      
 therefore,of great benefit to         
 commuters working in Manchester or to 
 shoppers travelling to major towns or 
 cities for the day.Crewe,itself,only  
 five miles from Sandbach,is easily    
 reached and from there rail           
 connections may be made to any part of
 the country served by the railway     
 network.                              
     A further feature of the area is  
 the Trent and Mersey Canal.Although of
 little commercial significance        
 nowadays it is well-used by holiday   
 boats and is well-maintained by the   
 British Waterways Board.              </content>
