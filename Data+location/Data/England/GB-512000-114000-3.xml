		<content> Housing in Ashington is very mixed,   
 comprising some ancient cottages and  
 farmhouses and,at the other end of the
 scale, modern houses and bungalows.   
{Public Authority Housing.             
 There are four sites comprising       
 housing provided from the 1930's      
 onwards by the local authorities - The
 Sands, Penn Gardens, Woelf's Close and
 Hillcrest Close (the last being blocks
 of flats for old people). Some houses 
 have been purchased by sitting tenants
 under recent legislation.             
{Privately Built Housing.}             
 Up to 1945 the village saw no dramatic
 changes, but the number of houses     
 increased spectacularly after the     
 Second World War. This new building   
 introduced a population having a more 
 urban than rural background. Several  
 small estates have been built during  
 the last twenty-six years.            </content>
