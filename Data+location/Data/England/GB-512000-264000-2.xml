		<title>02        FARMING</title>
		<content>    Nearly the whole of our area is    
 devoted to arable farming (with a     
 little pasture land for cows), yet,   
 owing to modern mechanisation, very   
 few are employed in it.               
    The main crops being grown this    
 year are wheat, barley, oil-seed rape,
 peas and onions. In 1984 Staughton    
 farmer, Mr.G.Peck, won the Toronto    
 Wheat Championship for the World's    
 best hard wheat.                      
    A few strawberry fields enable     
 villagers to have a traditional June  
 feast at 60p per pound !              
    Many people in our survey have     
 shown concern over the nuisance of    
 "cornflies" and of stubble-burning    
 which have plagued us in recent years.
    Woodlands on the incline to Perry, 
 traditionally open to the public on   
 Good Friday, exist primarily for Game 
 Shooting. Xmas trees are also grown.  </content>
