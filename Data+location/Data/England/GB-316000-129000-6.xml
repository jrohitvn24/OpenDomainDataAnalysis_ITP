		<content> The Village Hall is in the centre of  
 the village and is also the social    
 centre.The building consists of the   
 Mens Club,a small hall,kitchen and a  
 large hall with a permanent           
 stage.Attached is an open-air swimming
 pool with changing rooms and          
 toilets,this was given to the village 
 in 1974 by a local farmer.Outside the 
 Hall the younger children have a play 
 area incorporating many types of      
 equipment.Bounded by the Hall and two 
 streams is a large recreation field   
 which is used for a variety of events 
 but mainly as simply a place for old  
 and young to sit or play.The whole    
 complex is governed by a group of     
 elected representatives with the      
 Parish Council as the Custodian       
 Trustees.
