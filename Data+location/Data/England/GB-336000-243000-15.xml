		<content> BYFORD CHURCH                         
 People living on Byford Common attend 
 Byford church. There is a priest in   
 charge based at Weobly helped by a    
 retired clergyman at Staunton on Wye. 
 3 services a month are held with      
 congregation  averaging 20 with up to 
 80 at  Festivals. Due to the shortage 
 of clergy, villagers sometimes take   
 services. The church has just been    
 rewired and a new heating system      
 installed at a cost of Â£2800, the     
 money raised by local efforts and sale
 of surplus church silver. recent gifts
 to the church include churchwardens'  
 staves, a carpet runner, flower       
 pedestal and oak table. Affection for 
 the church is such that old           
 parishoners often bring their children
 and grandchildren back for baptism.
