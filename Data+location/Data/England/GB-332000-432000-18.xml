		<content>{Marton Mere Caravan Park}lies some two
 and a half miles from the centre of   
 Blackpool.It covers an area of 93     
 acres and is one of the major caravan 
 sites in the area.                    
 It derives its name from{Marton Mere  
 which lies close by.Originally this   
 was a very large expanse of water     
 which covered a considerable area of  
 the lower-lying land in this part of  
 the Fylde.Most of the flooded area was
 drained and reclaimed during the      
 19th.and early 20th.centuries although
 there is still quite a large expanse  
 of water.It is now the permanent and  
 temporary home for many different     
 birds and other wildlife.             
 The caravan park has many facilities  
 both for the static caravans and the  
 many touring caravans that visit the  
 area in the summer months. All the    
 main facilities are provided there.   </content>
