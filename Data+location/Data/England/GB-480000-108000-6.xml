		<content> A natural, privately-owned landmark,  
 400 feet above sea level, about one   
 mile north of{West Stoke, West Sussex.
 Beech trees at the summit were        
 originally planted by the{Duke of     
{Richmond}in l707-08, to commemorate a 
{Peninsular War}victory. Many old trees
 have fallen; and extensive replanting 
 has been done in recent years. The    
 surrounding fields are used for{wheat,
{dairy}and{sheep}farming. The          
 plantation on top is now used as cover
 for{pheasant-rearing.}The summit is   
 still used as a{sighting-marker}by    
 boats entering{Chichester Harbour}to  
 the S.W., enabling them to avoid the  
 dangerous sands at{East Head.}Current 
 hedge-dating techniques indicate a    
 pattern of enclosure in surrounding   
 land dating from approx. the          
 l5th.century                          
                                       </content>
