		<content>We are at the end of the Beechwoods of 
the Chiltern range of hills.THe area is
densely wooded with a few small farms  
scattered over a clay with flint       
terrain.The drainage of the area is    
southwards towards the River           
Thames.Woodcote is the largest         
community and is still developing with 
many new houses which are expensive    
and not many of the "local             
inhabitants" remain.Many people commute
to Reading or Oxford for their work.The
main A4074 links Wallingford to Reading
and is an important roadway north of   
the river. There is no railway.The     
Oratory school covers a large area and 
employs many local people.It is a      
private school which backs on to the   
playing fields of a primary and        
comprehensive campus.                  
A bus company is centred on Woodcote.
