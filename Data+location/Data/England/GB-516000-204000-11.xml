		<title>11The Herts Advertiser (contd)</title>
		<content> There are many ways to get news of a  
 story, but the 4 main ones are from   
 the Police, Council meetings, Court,  
 and people telling the paper.         
 Important news stories during 1985    
 have included the first test tube baby
 born in St. Albans, Â£220,000 shot gun 
 robbery, Â£64,000 bank robbery; but the
 most important story has been the     
 coach crash in France because it      
 affected St. Albans so much. There    
 were children involved from 2 local   
 secondary schools, Beaumont and       
 Verulam. When I asked Mr. Richardson  
 about the number of advertisements, he
 said that he did not print any more   
 than an ordinary newspaper. Every     
 paper needs advertisers because they  
 pay 99% of the costs. They have to pay
 for the printing paper and the upkeep 
 of the printing machines and the      
 building, plus other expenses.        </content>
