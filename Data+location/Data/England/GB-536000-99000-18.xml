		<title>18Games We Play Today</title>
		<content> When we go out to games we sometimes  
 play stoolball.The equipment we use is
 two blue posts which measure 140cms   
 they have white boards at the top     
 which measure 30cms by 30cms.We also  
 use two bats with round heads which   
 measure lengh 22cm and width 18cm.    
 We use a tennis ball as it is softer  
 than a hard ball.                     
        How to play the game           
       _______________________         
 You have two teams one side bats      
 and the other side fields one is      
 bowler.The bowler has six throws at   
 the batter  who has to protect the    
 white board with his bat.If he hits   
 the ball far enough he can get runs   
 for his team.He can be caught out or  
 run out.
