		<title>03SITE OF KELHAM</title>
		<content> The site of the small ,attractive     
 village of Kelham is in the Trent     
 Valley.It nestles in the curve of the 
 River Trent and is adjacent to Kelham 
 Bridge,which is often subject to      
 traffic "jams" due to its narrowness. 
 Land is mostly flat,well cultivated   
 and rises slightly where Kelham Hall  
 is situated.                          
 The population of 114 comes mainly    
 from council houses,private homes of a
 more modest nature,executive dwellings
 and farm worker cottages.A work force 
 commutes to Kelham Hall.Many houses   
 have been renovated but there has been
 little re-building in recent years.   
 Thus the population tends to be       
 predominately older.A building        
 programme is needed.                  
 Essential village meeting points are  
 the Post Office,Kelham Hall and the   
 Public House.                         </content>
