		<title>10STRETTINGTON &amp; WESTERTON</title>
		<content>{1895/1908.}(by Debbie Collins)        
{STRETTINGTON.}is a very small village 
 with no shops or Public Houses. Most  
 of the houses are finely built and    
 have very large gardens. One house has
 its own stables. Near the crossroads  
 on the Lavant Straight at the northern
 end of the village there are several  
 cottages built with flint walls and   
 tiled roofs. The houses are well      
 spread out so that strettington is a  
 long straggly village situated on a   
 country lane. At the southern end is  
 Temple Bar Farm and Strettington Farm.
 Both are arable farms.                
{WESTERTON}is a single street in a     
 horse shoe shape joined to a main road
 with a row of Goodwood Estate Houses. 
 There are also several large private  
 houses. At the end of the village is a
 Civil Defence Depot from the 2nd World
 War that is now disused.              </content>
