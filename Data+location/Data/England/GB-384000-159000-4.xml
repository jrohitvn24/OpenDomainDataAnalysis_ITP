		<content>   The Courts has seven acres of land. 
 It is open Monday to Friday from April
 1st till October 31st. The entrance   
 fee is Â£1, but the residents of Holt  
 are allowed in free of charge. The    
 house is no longer open to the public 
 although the gardens are. The Courts  
 has 300 types of cultivated plants and
 43 types of moiled (naturally grown)  
 plants. There are some rare plants;   
 for example, a rose called Salmon     
 Spray and a tree called the Italian   
 Cypress. There are a number of        
 interesting hedges in the grounds, one
 of which is shaped in the form of     
 dancing bears.                        
   The National Trust spends about     
 Â£15,300 p.a. on plants and machinery  
 and the gardeners work even when the  
 grounds are open. The average number  
 of visitors per year is about 4,500   
 people.                               </content>
