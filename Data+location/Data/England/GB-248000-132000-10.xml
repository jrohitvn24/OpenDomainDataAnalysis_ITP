		<content> Every Sunday between 11-12 o'clock the
 Methodist chapel has a morning        
 worship.We have an average of 25      
 people who attend (not including      
 children).At 11 o'clock we go into    
 chapel for half an  hour .            
 During that half hour the preacher    
 talks mainly to the children.At half  
 past we go into age group classes .   
 There are 5 classes.We have at least  
 20 or more children who attend        
 services .{                           
 There is also a Parish Church. The    
 vicar sometimes comes to our school   
 and takes an assembly.
