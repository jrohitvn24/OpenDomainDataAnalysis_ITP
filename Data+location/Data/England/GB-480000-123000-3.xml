		<content>    The village school is over a       
 hundred years old though it has been  
 moderised in 1962.  Now there are     
 three classrooms and a large hall.    
   A headmistress and two teachers look
 after the fifty seven children whose  
 ages start at five and rise to ten.   
 The oldest children's room has a      
 carpet with cushions on it where      
 poetry and library books can be read. 
 A computer often stands here.         
    Outside there is plenty of space to
 play on, a large field with several   
 trees makes lots of room for football 
 and catch games. During the summer    
 term we go swimming in the learner    
 pool.Nearly everyone can swim by the  
 time they leave the school. Another   
 popular activity is anything to do    
 with natural history especially       
 collecting specimens and examing them 
 in the classroom.                     </content>
