		<content> Rufford Colliery was sunk between 1911
 and 1913 by the Bolsover Colliery Co. 
 After nationalisation major reconstrct
 -ion took place between 1953 and 1955.
 In the early 1960's two drifts were   
 opened to High Hazel's seam.In 1972   
 two more drifts were opened.Methane   
 gas is drawn to the surface by vacuum 
 pumps,and a surface methane plant     
 supplies gas to fire a boiler plant   
 which provides heat for  the surface  
 buildings.The coal preparation plant  
 washes and grades the coal,the dirt   
 removed being spread and consolidated 
 on the dirt tip.Over 60% of output    
 goes to the steel industry,the rest to
 the house coal market.The coal faces  
 are highly mechanised.Sccessful operat
 -ion depends on high standards of     
 skill,technical ability and machine   
 operation and maintenance(see page    
 20).                                  </content>
