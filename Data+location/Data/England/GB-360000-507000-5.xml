		<title>05FARMING - SHEEP</title>
		<content>  In April, when the sheep are ready to
 lamb, the farmer brings them into     
 fields near the  farm so that he can  
 check them regulary. As the lambs     
 are born the farmer ensures that the  
 mother has sifficient milk for        
 them.He assists at the birth when     
 necessary. The sheep and lambs are    
 marked and taken back  on the fell.   
 Every year the sheep are dipped in    
 order to keep them free from          
 disease.In early summer the sheep have
 their wool clipped off. The fleece  is
 rolled up and placed in a large sack  
 prior to being taken to the woollen   
 mills. From September onwards the     
 lambs are taken to market to be sold  
 to the butchers.Some lambs are sent   
 away to other farms to be fattened.The
 tups are put with the ewes in October 
 and November.From time to time the    
 sheep have to be dosed.               </content>
