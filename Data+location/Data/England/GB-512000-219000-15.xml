 Peters Green is a small village. There
 are 40 houses they are mostly         
 bungalows. There is a village hall, it
 was built in 1929. There is a public  
 house with a play park. On the green  
 is the remains of an old village pond.
 There is a garage and a telephone box.
 We found a tree held up by a prop.    
 Next to the bus shelter is a post box 
 and at the back of the houses is a    
 black water tower. Next to this are   
 some allotments. There is a church and
 it was built in 1889. On a plaque     
 above the church door it says 'Perry  
 Green Church.' Around the village are 
 lots of woods and fields.
