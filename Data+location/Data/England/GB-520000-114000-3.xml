		<title>03A HENFIELD SCHOOL DAY.</title>
		<content>   We go to school for 8.50 a.m. and   
 at 8.55 a.m. the whistle goes.  We    
 lead in to our classes and put our    
 bags and coats in the classroom.      
 After the register we go to assembly. 
 In the Hall our Service is lead by the
 Headmaster, sometimes by the Deputy   
 Head, sometimes by visiting clergy and
 sometimes by classes.  I like these   
 assemblies best.  Afterwards we go    
 back to our classes and then start    
 work.  We do Maths, and English mainly
 in the mornings and sometimes there   
 are television programmes.  In the    
 afternoon we have Art and Craft,      
 R.I.,History and Geography.  I like   
 writing stories. I do not like copying
 writing. It is fun using the computer.
 I like games and Gym and my favourite 
 is Swimming. Playtimes are 10.30 to   
 10.45 a.m. and 2.30 to 2.45 p.m. Lunch
 is 12 to 1 p.m. We finish at 3.30 p.m.</content>
