		<title>17The Battle of Sedgemoor</title>
		<content> 1985 saw the Tercentenary of the      
 Monmouth Rebellion and the Battle of  
 Sedgemoor which was the last battle to
 be fought on English soil. The battle 
 took place very close to Middlezoy and
 so the village and the village school 
 were very involved in many of the     
 events held to commemorate the battle.
 All the children at Middlezoy School, 
 and many adults, dressed in 17th      
 Century-style costumes. The children  
 joined with children from other       
 neighbouring schools for a day of     
 activities which included a night camp
 and midnight walk to the actual battle
 site, dancing 17th century folk dances
 and a re-enactment of the battle on   
 the school playing field at           
 Westonzoyland. The Sealed Knot, an    
 organisation which specialises in such
 activities, also re-enacted the battle
 and held a mock trial and execution.  </content>
