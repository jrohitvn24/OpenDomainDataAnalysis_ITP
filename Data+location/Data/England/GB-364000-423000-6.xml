		<content>      Star Paper Mill started in 1875  
 and now employs about 650 people.     
      They make their paper from trees.
 The trees are cut up into smaller     
 pieces and brought to the mill. The   
 wood is then dissolved until it looks 
 like porridge. Then it is drained for 
 a long time on large sieves. Next it  
 is pressed to get out more of the     
 water and finally it is dried in huge 
 driers. Next the sheets are coated    
 with clay amongst other things and it 
 finishes up as high quality glossy    
 paper.                                
      Star Paper Mill is the only place
 in the country that makes such good   
 glossy paper. It is exported to       
 places all over the World including   
 Australia, South Africa, Russia and   
 America.
