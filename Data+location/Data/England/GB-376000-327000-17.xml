Somner Billington, who died in Sept    
1985 was a remarkable man. During a    
lifetime of farming in Adbaston, and   
retirement at Kemsey Manor, he took    
an active part in the local community. 
He was known and respected by all      
because of his zest for life,          
his friendliness and concern. He showed
an astonishing range of interests. He  
wrote a History of Adbaston Parish,    
was church organist for 40 years and   
was very practical e.g. he made a set  
of heavy metal brackets for the new    
heating system in the church. At       
various times he held the offices of   
Church Warden, Vice-chairman of the    
P.C.C. and Treasurer.
