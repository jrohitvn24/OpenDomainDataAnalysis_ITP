 fattened and killed for{beef,}and some
 also keep{sheep}for{wool}and{meat.    
      A lot of time is taken in        
 fattening up cattle. They have to be  
 bought from the{market. Grass}is      
 grown to make{silage}to feed the      
 cattle, then they are weighed and when
 they are the right weight, they are   
 taken to the abbattoir.               
{     Spring}is a busy time for a      
 farmer because of{lambing.}Often      
 farmers have to be up for much of the 
 night tending the ewes as they give   
 birth. When the{rams}are big enough   
 they are sent to market, the{ewes}are 
 kept for{wool}and{lambing.            
      The farmers take their cattle to 
 the markets in{St.Austell and         
{Liskeard.
