		<content> This is quite a good area for         
 gardening in that the winter climate  
 is not so severe as more easterly     
 parts of the county. Most plants grow 
 well,particularly Rhododendrons and   
 other ericaceous plants as it is      
 mainly an acid soil in the area.Spring
 bulbs such as Narcissi do well and    
 also vegetables,as can be seen by the 
 excellent display of them at the      
 Annual Flower Show. The damper climate
 has its drawbacks;in summer,Potatoes  
 are often attacked by Blight,unless   
 treated with a preventive fungicide;in
 winter,plants of the Dianthus         
 family,and Alpine plants,often die off
 as they do not like cold,damp         
 conditions at ground level.           
   Longtown Horticultural              
 Society,although not large,has some   
 very keen members,and holds           
 talks,visits and outings.             </content>
