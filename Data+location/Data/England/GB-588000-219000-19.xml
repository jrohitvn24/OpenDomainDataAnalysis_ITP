		<content>   Most houses in the Easthorpe area   
 are owned by their occupants.Easthorpe
 village is a more interesting area    
 than Easthorpe.                       
 Bell house was a former pub and it    
 dates back to the roundheads period.  
 Onslow cottages were being built      
 between the first world war,and       
 during the beginning of the war the   
 building was stopped by the council   
 and was started again in 1940.The     
 local pub in Easthorpe is 400 years   
 old and used to be a shop.We also went
 to the O.K.cafe and interviewed the   
 daughter of the owner and asked her   
 how old the cafe was and the answer   
 was 40 years old.Situated at the side 
 of the A12 there is a kennels and     
 the house was built in 1940.The man   
 that lives there has dogs and the     
 house has two big living rooms.
