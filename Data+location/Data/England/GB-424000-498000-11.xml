		<title>11THE STORY OF ST. JOHN OF GOD</title>
		<content>                                       
   John Ciudad was a poor shepherd boy 
 who was born in Portugal in 1495.Then 
 he travelled around from place to     
 place.He took part in a Crusade.In    
 North Africa he worked at building up 
 thr fortifications.The other workers  
 were convicts and he was treated as   
 badly as they were.He was 55.         
   John went back to Spain.He saw all  
 the cripples and he went begging for  
 money to look after them.One day the  
 home caught fire and he saved every   
 one of them.Some people said he must  
 be mad and some people called him John
 of God.One day a boy fell into the    
 river and John went in to save him.The
 boy drowned and John died of pneumonia
 soon afterwards.                      
   Our hospital is called St.John of   
 God hospital because he is the patron 
 saint of hospitals and nurses.        </content>
