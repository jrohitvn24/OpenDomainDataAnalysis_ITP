      Here are some of the games which 
 are played in Great Britian in the    
 1980's.The first game is called       
 it!which is one of the most popular   
 games played in Great Britian.To play 
 you have to have a group of children. 
 One person is got to be it while the  
 other people run away.When the person 
 who is it! catches them they are it   
 instead of the person who has just    
 been it.Another game which is played  
 is Leapfrog.You play Leapfrog  with   
 four or five people how line up and   
 bend down.One person runs up to the   
 line and jumps over the other         
 children.When the jumper has jumped   
 over each one they bend down and the  
 last one begins the process all again.
