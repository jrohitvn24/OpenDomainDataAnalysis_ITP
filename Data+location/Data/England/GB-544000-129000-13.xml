		<title>13NUTLEY WINDMILL</title>
		<content> There are only four windmills of this 
 primitive type in the country. About  
 300 years old, it is an open trestle  
 post mill with the body of the mill   
 balanced so perfectly on a single post
 that it only needs the strength of one
 man to turn it into the wind. The post
 and trestle are open to the elements, 
 which is an unusual feature. The small
 gears are of iron and the larger of   
 wood which was considered to be the   
 best combination. The millstones, meal
 grading machinery, sack hoist and     
 other machines are still there,       
 including the brake. Flour is still   
 ground occasionally and sold. The     
 Windmill has been restored by the     
 Uckfield Preservation Society and is  
 open to the public once a month and at
 Bank Holidays in the summer months.
