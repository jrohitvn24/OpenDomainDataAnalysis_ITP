 Arable{FARMING}is the dominant land   
 use in the area, most of the land     
 being owned by one family, who farm at
 Home Farm. They grow a variety of     
 crops which are rotated annually.     
 The crops include oil seed rape,      
 winter wheat, winter and spring       
 barley, spring beans which are sold   
 for pigeon food, durum wheat used to  
 make pasta, and grass. The grass is   
 used when the land lies fallow for a  
 year, and it is then grazed by        
 racehorses from Newmarket. They also  
 have a small number of beef cattle.   
 The steep valley side prevents any    
 possible expansion of the village of  
 Stanstead Abbotts, and conceals the   
 built-up area of the valley floor from
 the view of the farmhouse, which looks
 over to the other side of the valley.
