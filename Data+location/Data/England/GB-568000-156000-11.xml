		<title>11The Ditton Club</title>
		<content> Ditton Club was founded as "Ditton &amp;  
 Neighbouring Parishes' Working Men's  
 Club" in 1887. The objectives of the  
 club, as stated in the Rule Book, are 
 "to afford to its members the means of
 social intercourse,mutual helpfulness,
 mental and moral improvement and      
 rational recreation."   Nowadays,     
 facilities are available for playing  
 Cribbage, Euchre, Whist, Darts, Pool  
 Dominoes, Shove Ha'penny and Bingo,   
 whilst for the youngsters there are   
 video machines and discos. More adult 
 groups play on Saturday nights. At    
 Christmas there is a children's party,
 at Easter a Bonnet Parade and at      
 Halloween a Fancy Dress competition.  
 Outings to race meetings take place   
 and the Club won the competition for  
 the best float on "Funday" in 1985.
