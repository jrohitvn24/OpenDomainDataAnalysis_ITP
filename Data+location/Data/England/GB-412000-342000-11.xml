		<content>Anacre Hill Farm, Snelston is a 54 acre
all grass dairy farm and is farmed by  
the owners Dorothy and Gordon Grindey. 
The house and buildings are very old   
but have been modernised as far as     
possible, enabling the owners to do the
farming themselves, apart from having a
contractor to make "Big Bale Silage"   
for winter feed.                       
  The stock consists of 47 Guernsey    
cows which are tied up and milked by   
pipeline into a bulk tank and 24       
followers of different ages.  It is by 
fertilizing and reseeding that they are
able to keep that amount of stock.     
Also they rent some ground in another  
parish from which they get some hay.   
  Recently there has been a change in  
the pig enterprise, 20 breeding sows   
have been sold, and they are buying    
weaners to fatten instead (less work).
