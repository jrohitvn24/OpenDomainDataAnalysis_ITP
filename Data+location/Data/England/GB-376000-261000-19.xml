		<title>19ECOLOGY OF LITTLE WITLEY</title>
		<content>{GEOLOGY}- Keuper sandstone is general 
 in the north-east, the rest being     
 Keuper marl. The Little Witley fault  
 is readily visible at NGR786639.      
 Drainage is all easterly into the     
 river Severn 4 km to the west. Much of
 the area receives its water supply    
 from boreholes into the Bunter        
 sandstone @ 10km north of the block.  
{CLIMATE}- Rainfall is about 650 mm per
 year and the generally mild climatee  
 has characteristic spring droughts;   
 snowfall is light but late frosts     
 occur into May, strong winds are rare 
 due to Ankerdine and associated hills 
 within 5km south-west. Irrigation of  
 arable crops is needed most years.    
{LAND-USE}- Market garden and general  
 arable crops are grown on the lighter 
 soils; the marl areas have more leys  
 and permanent grass, orchard and      
 woods, including semi-natural oak.    </content>
