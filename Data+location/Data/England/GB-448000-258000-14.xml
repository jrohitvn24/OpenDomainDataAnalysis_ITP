		<content>Foxes and badgers can both be seen     
quite a lot in our block.Badger        
scrapings are often seen in the area up
to 1Km. west of Catesby church.Hares   
and rabbits are widespread,so are hedge
hogs which are often accident victims  
on roads.Harvest mice and long-tailed  
field mice are seen in good nos.,as are
field voles.Frogs,especially,and toads 
are often seen;sometimes whole'swarms' 
of little frogs go on the move.We found
grass snakes too,but the only common   
bat is the pipistrelle.We saw quite a  
few weasels,and some stoats.           
We tried to work out what were the most
common butterflies in our block;these  
were our'Top Ten':small tortoiseshell, 
peacock,red admiral,comma,painted lady,
cabbage white,small white,black-veined 
white,brimstone and lesser blue.Near to
the ground,we saw treecreepers,herons.
