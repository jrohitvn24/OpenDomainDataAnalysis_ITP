		<title>06The Stroudwater Canal</title>
		<content>    Cut in the 1790's from Framilode on
 the River Severn to Wallbridge at     
 Stroud, to cope with the increased    
 demand for coal following the         
 introduction of steam power in the    
 woollen and other industries further  
 up the Stroud Valley, it became part  
 of the canal link from the Severn to  
 the Thames.                           
    It has not been used as a navigable
 waterway for at least 60 years, and   
 was blocked by road improvements at   
 the A38 Bristol to Gloucester Road.   
                                       
    Volunteer organisations concerned  
 with our heritage are restoring the   
 lock gates but as the link road from  
 the A38 to the M5 Motorway is now     
 built on part of the canal bed it     
 will not be possible to reconnect it  
 with the Severn along its original    
 path.                                 </content>
