Some people like a detached house,     
With a double garage,                  
And central-heating,                   
You can have your own bedroom,         
And a bidet in the bathroom,           
And a great big garden to play in.     
                                       
Some people like a semi,               
With a swing in the garden,            
And a sandpit to dig in,               
You can borrow next-door's lawnmower,  
And dance to their records,            
And listen when they have a row.       
                                       
Some people like a flat,               
It's cosy and quiet,                   
With a neat little kitchen,            
And a view across the country,         
And geraniums on the balcony,          
And stairs to run up and down.
