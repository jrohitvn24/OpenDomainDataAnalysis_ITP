		<title>10Services in Stevington</title>
		<content> Every property in Stevington is       
 connected to the main electricity     
 supply.Many people rely on this as    
 their main source of power for        
 heating,cooking and general purposes. 
 There is no main gas supply but calor 
 gas can be stored either in bottle    
 form or in tanks stored beside        
 premises.Oil is used in some houses   
 for heating.This also has to be stored
 in tanks.All properties are connected 
 to the main water supply but a few    
 have only an external water tap.The   
 majority of buildings are joined to   
 the main sewage system but some have  
 to rely on cess pits in order to      
 reduce the load on the main sewer.Most
 people are telephone subscribers.Every
 home has a radio set and almost all   
 have a television set.Some people own 
 C.B.radio systems and can talk to     
 people all over the world.            </content>
