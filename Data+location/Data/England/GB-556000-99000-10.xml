		<content> FASHION IS ALWAYS CHANGING. IN OUR    
 AREA THERE ARE A LOT OF ELDERLY PEOPLE
 SO THERE IS A BIG DIFFERENCE IN THE   
 TYPES AND STYLES OF CLOTHES WORN BY   
 THE ELDERLY,MIDDLE AGED AND YOUNG.    
 OLD MEN WEAR SUITS WITH TIES AND OFTEN
 WEAR A HAT. OLD WOMEN TEND TO WEAR    
 KNEE LENGTH DRESSES WITH FLORAL       
 PATTERS ON THEM. THEY ALWAYS SEEM TO  
 WEAR HATS.                            
 MIDDLE AGED MEN AND WOMEN APPEAR TO   
 WEAR MORE CASUAL CLOTHES BUT STILL    
 APPEAR SMARTLY DRESSED.               
 YOUNG PEOPLE OFTEN WEAR TRENDY OR EVEN
 OUTRAGEOUS FASHIONS.CLOTHES ARE VERY  
 BRIGHT IN COLOUR AND DO NOT APPEAR TO 
 HAVE ANY REAL IDEA OF PLEASING THE    
 EYE.SOME YOUNG PEOPLE DRESS TO BE     
 EASILY IDENTIFIABLE IN A CROWD.OTHERS 
 THINK IT IS GOOD FUN TO BE DIRTY AND  
 UNTIDY.
