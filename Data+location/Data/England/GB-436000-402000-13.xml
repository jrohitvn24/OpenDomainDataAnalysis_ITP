		<title>13MY BEST HOBBY - P.OXLEY</title>
		<content> I AM 11 AND I KEEP 2 RABBITS, SAVE    
 COINS, AM A BOY SCOUT AND I LIKE      
 PLAYING FOOTBALL. MY CHIEF HOBBY      
 THOUGH IS KARATE', MY CLUB MEETS TWICE
 A WEEK. 'KARATE' IS AN ART OF SELF    
 DEFENCE AND THOSE WHO PRACTISE IT ARE 
 NOT ALLOWED TO USE IT EXCEPT IN       
 SELFDEFENCE. AS WE PROGRESS THROUGH IT
 WE ARE AWARDED BELTS OF DIFFERENT     
 COLOURS FOR DIFFERENT GRADES. THE     
 FIRST ONE IS WHITE AND THE LAST IS    
 BLACK. I AM A GREEN BELT.WHEN DOING   
 'KARATE' WE WEAR A LOOSE TUNIC CALLED 
 A 'GEE' AND WHEN WRESTLING WE CAN     
 BLOCK, KICK AND PUNCH. OUR INSTRUCTOR 
 IS A BLACK BELT AND I THINK HE'S      
 BRILLIANT. IT IS A SPORT IN WHICH BOTH
 SEXES CAN TAKE PART, AND IN OUR CLUB  
 WE HAVE 1 WOMAN, 2 GIRLS, 5 MEN AND 8 
 BOYS.                                 
                                       
                                       </content>
