		<title>20CORPORAL R.A.F. WADDINGTON</title>
		<content>   The Corporal is married to an R.A.F.
 ex-serviceman and they live at        
 Bracebridge, near to lower Waddington.
 Fortunately she does not have to work 
 shifts and so she can start work at   
 8.30am and finish at 5.00pm.          
   The Corporal's day begins at 7.15am 
 and she manages an hour for lunch.    
   She used to work as an air traffic  
 controller but now is in flight       
 planning; providing routes, weather   
 conditions, take off and landing times
 and arranging accomodation and meals  
 for incoming air crew.                
   After work the Corporal has tea and 
 then enjoys gardening or watching T.V.
 She goes to bed around 10.00pm.
