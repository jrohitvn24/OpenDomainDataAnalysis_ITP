		<title>14REAVELEY FARM</title>
		<content> Reavely is a tiny collection of houses
 and a farm.Until ten years ago the    
 farm manager lived in the large farm  
 house.His family now reside in what   
 was the game-keepers cottage.The farm 
 house has now been sold               
 privately.There are also two          
 semi-detached houses where the        
 shepherd and farm worker live with    
 their families.Apart from these houses
 there is nothing apart from old-style 
 stone built farm buildings.A recent   
 addition to the steading has been a   
 large multi-purpose farm shed which is
 used for storage of crops such as hay 
 and also for shelter of animals-such  
 as ewes at lambing time.              
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
