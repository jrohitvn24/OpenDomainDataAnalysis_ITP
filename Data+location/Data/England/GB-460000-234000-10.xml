		<title>10THE DAILY LIFE OF A CHILD</title>
		<content> My name is Katherine Duerden.I am 8   
 years old and I go to the village     
 school. It is a new school.The old    
 National school in the main street is 
 being converted into a house.We start 
 at 8.45 with assembly.After that we do
 maths and English in our work books   
 until first playtime at 10.30.Then we 
 either finish off work or read and do 
 project work.This year we have studied
 grasses for an Aylesbury Vale science 
 project and Ghana.At the end of term  
 our concert was about Anansi a village
 drummer in Ghana. I played Anansi.    
 Lunch is at 12.00.Meals are cooked at 
 the school but I take a packed lunch. 
 After lunch play we do some art and   
 craft.Last play is at 14.15-14.30 then
 we have music or a story. School      
 finishes at 3.00. I can walk home but 
 half the pupils get the school bus to 
 the neighbouuring villages.           </content>
