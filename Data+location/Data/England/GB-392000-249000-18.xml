		<title>18Changes in Pinvin</title>
		<content>    We went around Pinvin asking       
 people how long they had lived in the 
 area. Most people hadn't lived there  
 for more than 14 years, but one       
 elderly woman had spent 70 years      
 living in Pinvin.                     
    We asked them what changes they    
 had noticed during their time. People 
 said that more private houses had been
 built, the middle school was a recent 
 addition, new roads had been laid and 
 old ones repaired. An estate of       
 elderly peoples' bungalows had been   
 built in the last 15 years.           
    Some of the elderly villagers had  
 been born in Pinvin and attended the  
 old First school from the age of five 
 until they were fourteen. In those    
 days there was no Middle or High      
 school to go onto. We are lucky today 
 because our education seems to be much
 better.                               </content>
