		<content> I live beside the main road which runs
 through the middle of Stoke Canon.    
 Opposite where I live is Stoke Canon  
 Garage, which is run by George        
 Harrison.Further up the road is the   
 Chapel which is next to the Village   
 Hall. Along the road is the pub, the  
 Stoke Canon Inn.  It is just under 100
 years old. The land before that was   
 used as a coal yard.The old pub,the   
 late Kings Arms, is now a house. The  
 Post Office, owned by Brian Fordham,  
 is the only shop in the village.Across
 the road there is the old Vicarage and
 the new Vicarage.The Vicar,Dr.Avis,   
 lives in the new Vicarage, and next to
 the old Vicarage is Stoke Canon       
 Primary School.Next to that is the    
 church.There are also some flats, and 
 lots of houses and cottages. I live in
 a cottage near Stoke Canon Bridge.
