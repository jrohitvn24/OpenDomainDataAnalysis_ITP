 The impressions of a nine year old    
 visitor.                              
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
 St.George's Retreat is a place where  
 old people go to die. My auntie took  
 me there and showed me round .I met an
 old lady there who looked rather sad. 
 I think she was sad because she did   
 not want to die. She cheered up after 
 a little while because she had not    
 seen a young face for a long time. I  
 also met her husband and he was rather
 upset as well. On the north side of   
 St.George's Retreat there is a chapel.
 I think it would be a nice place to   
 die but I think there shoud be some   
 young people to brighten the place up.
