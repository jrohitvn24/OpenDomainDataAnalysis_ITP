 Policing of the area is carried out by
 a Police Constable, who lives in the  
 local Police House, within the        
 village. There he has his own office, 
 from which he works, but no cells. His
 area covers almost 15 square miles    
 surrounding Godshill, taking in other 
 smallvillages. This he patrols on a   
 motorcycle, which has a 2-way VHF     
 radio so that he is in constant touch 
 with his base station of Shanklin,    
 from where he can call on the         
 assistance of other officers when     
 needed. His duties include dealing    
 with the large influx of summer       
 visitors and traffic to the village,  
 as well as his more normal duties of  
 visiting farms, and with his close    
 local knowledge, dealing with crime,  
 traffic accidents and other matters.
