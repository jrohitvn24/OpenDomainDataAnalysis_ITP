		<content> Our survey is centred on the village  
 of Daresbury and the surrounding area 
 which is between Runcorn and          
 Warrington just off the A56. The area 
 is mainly farm land, the village is   
 still a rural community despite its   
 closeness to the new towns of Runcorn 
 and Warrington. Best known as the     
 birthplce of Lewis Carroll the author 
 of 'Alice in Wonderland'. The Parish  
 Church has a delightful stained glass 
 window which commerates the centenary 
 of his birth. The window was dedicated
 by Dr. Gresford Jones, the Bishop of  
 Warrington on the 30th of June 1934.  
 People come from as far as America,   
 Japan and the USSR to visit the       
 birthplace of Charles Dodgson. The    
 local landscape is dominated by the   
 tower at Daresbury Laboratories,      
 Fidlers Ferry Power Station and the   
 River Mersey.                         </content>
