		<content> The area of land is classified as     
 permanent pasture or long term leys.  
 Reseeding only occurring in enclosed  
 fields to "bulk up" grass for         
 conservation purposes. All the level  
 enclosed fields are mowable for either
 silage or hay, silage being preferred 
 as it is a much better winter feed.   
 Livestock kept are mainly cattle and  
 sheep, although small herds of deer   
 graze the parkland. The sheep flock is
 primarily a Mule flock (Swaledale x   
 Blue Faced Leicester) which are       
 crossed with Suffolk, Hampshire Down  
 and Texel rams to produce ideal       
 finished lambs for sale. A small      
 purebred Jacob flock is also kept but 
 managed as a commercial flock. The    
 beef herd of Hereford x Friesian cows 
 are autumn calving to Limousin and    
 Charolais bulls with progeny sold at  
 fifteen months as store cattle.       </content>
