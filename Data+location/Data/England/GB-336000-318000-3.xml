		<title>03RAF LIFE IN NESSCLIFFE</title>
		<content>  My Dad is in the RAF. I was born in  
 Germany in l977 and since then I have 
 moved six times.  Ihave got two       
 brothers they are called Ruari and    
 Peter. Ruari is older than Peter.     
 Ruari was born in Shropshire and Peter
 was born in Belfast.Living in quarters
 is all right but you have to be       
 careful because the furniture is the  
 Queen's and that makes it a bit       
 worrying.  I like moving because I can
 climb in the boxes.  When I came to   
 Nesscliffe I was not surprised we were
 going to live in Quarters again       
 because wewere in Quarters before we  
 moved. When I came to school I was a  
 bit nervous as most people are when   
 they come to a new school. I think    
 this school is excellent because we   
 make models and things and I have made
 some good friends but I have not got  
 many where I live.  CONTINUE          </content>
