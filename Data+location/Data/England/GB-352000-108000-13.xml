		<content> In both Pendomer and Halstock the     
 population is fairly mixed, with      
 natives and incomers, retired, working
 and young people. In Pendomer all     
 those who work are engaged in farming,
 but a number of Halstock residents    
 commute to Yeovil, where they work for
 Westland Helicopters or elsewhere.    
 There are local families who have     
 lived in the area for generations, but
 a number of people - and they include 
 farmers as well as retired folk - have
 moved here from other areas such as   
 London and the South-East. The people 
 of Halstock enjoy the amenity of a    
 shop and Post Office and a pub and    
 they are also served by a visiting    
 butcher, fishmonger and travelling    
 library; but for more ambitious       
 shopping they travel to Yeovil by car 
 or the weekly bus.
