		<content>  When the children reach the September
following their eleventh birthday they 
must leave Langford School and go on to
Burford Secondary School.They must     
leave their small school of 71 children
and go on to a school with over 1,000  
children in it.                        
  They are transported by coach each   
day to Burford.They leave the village  
at about 7.50am. to start school at    
8.30am. School finishes at 3.15pm.     
  In their last term at Langford School
some of the teachers from Burford      
School visit one morning to talk to the
children. Near the end of the term they
spend a whole day at Burford meeting   
some of their new teachers and         
classmates and looking around the      
buildings and grounds. They also have  
the opportunity to visit the school    
with their parents one evening in the  
July Term.                             </content>
