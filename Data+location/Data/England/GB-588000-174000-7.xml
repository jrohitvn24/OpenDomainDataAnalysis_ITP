      TWINNING STARTED IN 1967 WHEN    
 LOCAL AUTHORITIES BORDERING THE       
 MEDWAY DECIDED TO CELEBRATE THE DEFEAT
 OF THE DUTCH IN I667 AFTER THEIR      
 INVASION OF QUEENBOROUGH.             
      QUEENBOROUGH THEN DECIDED TO TWIN
 WITH A DUTCH TOWN.BRIELLE WAS CHOSEN  
 BECAUSE OF ITS SIMILAR MARITIME       
 HISTORY AND THE FACT THAT,            
 GEOGRAPHICALLY,THEY OCCUPY SIMILAR    
 POSITIONS ON ISLANDS IN ESTUARIES OF  
 IMPORTANT RIVER SYSTEMS.              
      IT WAS AGREED THAT TWINNING      
 SHOULD ENCOMPASS THE WHOLE OF THE ISLE
 OF SHEPPEY.                           
      SINCE THEN MANY LOCAL SPORTS     
 CLUBS HAVE ORGANISED EXCHANGES AND    
 COMPETITIONS WITH BRIELLE.ALSO THE    
{QUEENBOROUGH-BRIELLE}COMMITTEE        
 REGUARLY VISIT THE COUNTRY.
