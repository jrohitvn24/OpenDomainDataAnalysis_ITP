		<content> From our survey it seems most people  
 get up about 7.30am very few watch the
 fairly new introduction of breakfast  
 television even though many people are
 retired. Most couples shop locally for
 small items nearly every day.Few of   
 these families eat meat every day soup
 and egg dishes  are favourites. They  
 seldom try foreign dishes (continental
 or Indian) only the odd venturesome   
 couple will try any thing new! Most   
 couples had changed in one respect, in
 that they had a snack at lunchtime    
 rather than the traditional main      
 meal,the main meal being taken between
 6 and 8 o'clock                       
 Most then watched television. They all
 thought Tenterden had adequate        
 amenities for them. Gardening was a   
 favourite hobby and some played       
 bridge.
