		<title>02CHANGES IN GRETTON FROM 1918</title>
		<content>   Gretton in 1918 was a very different
village from the Gretton of the 1980's.
Most of the houses were built of stone 
with thatched roofs. The first council 
houses were not built until 1921. There
was a Wesleyan Chapel in addition to   
the Parish and Baptist Churches. The   
streets were lit by oil lamps until    
electricity was brought to the village 
in 1931. All water had to be drawn from
wells or springs. A mains supply was   
connected in the late 1940's. Mains    
sewerage arrived later than that. One  
interesting building in Gretton seventy
five years ago was the "sanctuary".    
This was particularly helpful to wrong-
doers. If anyone who had committed a   
crime could reach this building and    
climb up to a little tower at the top  
with slit windows before being caught  
by the police, he was a free man.
