		<title>16CHALFONT AREA FARMING</title>
		<content>Farming in the area is particularly    
varied, with quite a heavy emphasis    
placed on crop growing. This is        
probably due to the influence of the   
E.E.C.. In addition to crop growing    
farms there are also a few small       
holdings, which have either a few cows 
or sheep. Horseriding is particularly  
popular locally and this is also       
reflected in the farms. Of the seven   
farms visited four were mainly stud    
farms. Stone Dean farm houses about    
thirty horses. It was built in 1891 and
the owners of this farm, as well as    
those of other farms, rent a           
considerable proportion of the total   
average. They own thirty-two acres and 
rent three times this amount, for      
riding and grazing purposes. Stampwell 
Farm was one of the biggest visted. The
owners did not rent any land, all the  
275 acres are their own property.      </content>
