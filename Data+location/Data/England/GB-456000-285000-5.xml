 We 11 year old girls wear lipstick in 
 pastel shades.On our eyes we wear     
 black mascara.This is a pot of liquid 
 with a special brush.We mostly wear   
 blue or black eye-liner.On our cheeks 
 we wear a pastel coloured blusher.    
 The clothes we wear in winter are big 
 woolly jumpers,baggy jeans and short  
 socks or tights.We usually wear grey  
 jeans but there are black and blue as 
 well.Jumpers are usually in bright    
 colours and some are bat-winged.This  
 means that the sleeves get larger as  
 they get near your waist.             
 In the summer we wear big,            
 short-sleeved tee-shirts,baggy shorts 
 and short socks.Pastel colours are the
 most popular this summer.             
 Short hair-cuts are in fashion,with   
 the hair just above the shoulder and  
 the fringe spikey.                    </content>
