		<title>15GREAT WEST PLANTATION STUDY</title>
		<content> The above woodland is near Upsall     
 Hall. At approximately 46.7m above sea
 level, under the shade of the         
 coniferous trees, little grew in      
 the way of plants. Under a simple     
 everyday plastic bag, we found small  
 and large snails, woodlice and other  
 insects. Between the trees there was  
 very little sunlight, but where there 
 was, brambles and blue-bells took     
 over. Lower down the hill at          
 approximately 32.9m above sea level   
 there were Oaks, Beeches, Elderberry, 
 Sycamores, Silver Birches and other   
 types like Holly and Common Ash       
 growing in the deciduous part of the  
 wood. The land we covered was l94m    
 running East to West. The girth       
 measurements of the trees were from 50
 to 285cm. We also found 3 pheasant    
 chicks which were so well camouflaged 
 we nearly stood on them.              </content>
