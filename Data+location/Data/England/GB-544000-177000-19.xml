		<title>19A SCHOOL DAY;PLUMSTEAD</title>
		<content>I live in Plumstead High Street so it's
quite a walk to school from my house.  
It takes me half an hour to walk there.
When I do get to school the teacher    
takes the register and we have to do   
the work she has put on the board. We  
have assemblies on Tuesday, Wednesday  
and sometimes Thursday. We have P.E. on
Monday, Wednesday Thursday, and        
swimming on Friday. There are 271      
children in our school. We have three  
playtimes. The first one isa in the    
morning at 10.15 and the others are at 
12.05 and 2.15 p.m. After that we do   
some more work and at 3 o'clock        
Mr.Bruce sometimes reads a story and at
3.30 we go home. When I get home I     
watch the children's programmes, do my 
homework, or if I do not have any I    
either go out to play, do the washing  
up, help my mum with the cooking or go 
shopp@ing with her.          Sherima   </content>
