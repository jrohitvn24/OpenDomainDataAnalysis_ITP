		<title>08WELBURY VILLAGE HALL EVENTS</title>
		<content>  Apart from the usual annual events   
 there has been an extra effort        
 by Welbury villagers to raise money   
 towards the purchase of the land the  
 village hall stands on and the        
 eventual improvement of the hall. Two 
 ladies ran in the Appleton Wiske 'Fun 
 Run'and were sponsered by every       
 villager.There was a Photographic     
 Exhibition of local life by Jane      
 Greenwell with Afternoon teas provided
 by the W.I. In the summer months 2 car
 'Treasure Hunts'were organised, and a 
 'Field Party' which consisted of a    
 'Ploughmans Lunch with beer &amp; wine to 
 drink and various games to keep the   
 children amused.Major &amp; Mrs.Arkwright 
 hosted a 'Sangria Evening'. A 'Race   
 night was held at Appleton Wiske      
 Village Hall.Bets were placed,then we 
 watched a film of the race, then      
 hopefully collected winnings.         </content>
