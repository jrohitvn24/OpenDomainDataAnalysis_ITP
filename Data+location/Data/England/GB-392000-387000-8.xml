		<content>     Our dog is a{Doberman.}He has a   
 large chest. We bought him as a six   
 week old puppy. He is a softy.        
     My uncles dog is called Rocky, he 
 is Don's son and is{black and tan.}He 
 was born in Hyde which is near        
 Stockport. He is separated from Don.He
 stays at our house all day for five   
 days a week.                          
     When he was small he had most of  
 his{tail cut}off at the vets. Then he 
 came to ouyr house to live in our     
 downstairs washroom which was an ideal
 size.                                 
     Next he went to live in the       
 boxroom, upstairs and now he{lives in 
{the kitchen.                          
     Don is very jealous,Rocky bites   
 and nips Don who gets annoyed and then
 tells Rocky off.
