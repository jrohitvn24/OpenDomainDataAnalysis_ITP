		<content> There is one particular game I like   
 best that is{cricket.}We play it like 
 this. About twenty people can play    
 this game. One person uses a piece of 
 wood with a handle on it. It is called
 a bat. A man stands near three stumps,
 another man throws the ball over his  
 head. The{batsman}tries to stop the   
 ball from hitting the stumps. The rest
 of the men space out. They are called 
{fielders,}they catch the ball. If the 
{batsman}hits the ball into the        
{fielders}hands he is out and that is  
 how you play{cricket.                 
                                       
 This is another good game, it is      
 called{football.}It is a game where   
 twenty-two people can play on a pitch 
 and a man stands under the net and    
 they have to get the ball in the net  
 to score a goal. That is how you play 
 football.                             </content>
