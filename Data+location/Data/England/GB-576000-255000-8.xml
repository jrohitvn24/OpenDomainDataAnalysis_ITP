		<title>08LIFE IN DEPDEN - GENERAL</title>
		<content>I live with my husband, a builder, and 
four children Jason aged 14, Jonathan  
12, Sallyanne 6 3/4 and Roy 4 in the   
village of Depden.                     
Depden has no shop, post office, school
village hall or pub only a church known
as the' church in the fields' as there 
is no road access to it, only a        
footpath.                              
We rely on the surrounding villages for
shops and recreation facilites. The    
nearest primary school is in Chedburgh 
and the middle and senior schools in   
Bury. This means my three oldest       
children have to travel to school by   
bus.                                   
In order to take advantage of the      
amentities in the surrounding area your
own transport is a necessity.          
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
