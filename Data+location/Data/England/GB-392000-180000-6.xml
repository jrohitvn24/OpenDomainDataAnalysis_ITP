		<content> I wake up at 7o'clock in the morning. 
 I get changed and go downstairs.I blow
 the husk's off of my budgerigars food,
 and give him fresh water.Then I let   
 him out so that he can exercise       
 himself. I read till Mum calls        
 for breakfast.I open the cupboard and 
 get down the cereal,Crunchy Nut       
 Cornflakes.Then I have some toast and 
 marmalade,and I get ready to go to    
 school.So I get home and go straight  
 into the living room,to let my        
 budgerigar out for his exercise.I put 
 him back in his cage and I take him   
 and his cage outside and hang the cage
 on the apple tree.                    
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
