		<title>07The River Thame</title>
		<content>The River Thame flows through the area 
from Ickford Bridge to Shabbington in a
wide loop that runs round Manor Farm,  
Shabbington.It often floods its banks  
in wet weather and the fields can be   
seen flooded from the A418.In winter it
flows very fast and at Ickford Bridge  
it is about 10ft wide but is only 2m   
wide at Shabbington.We saw a kingfisher
at Ickford and ducks,coots,and moorhen 
can be seen at The Old Fisherman Pub at
Shabbington,which is popular with      
children as the river runs through the 
pub garden which has swings,and the    
river is shallow enough to paddle.Here 
too is a floodmarker.In wet winters the
river floods the road and a raised     
walkway is next to the road for walkers
each side of the river.A London        
Piscatorial Society fishes the river   
here.We saw two types of dragonfly in  
the reeds by the riverbank.            </content>
