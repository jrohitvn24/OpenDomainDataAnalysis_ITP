		<title>08Friday with Kirsty (2)</title>
		<content>  I don't take school meals; I take    
sandwiches so I am on second sittings. 
After I have eaten I play in the       
playground for a while. I play at      
skipping. During Friday lunchtimes I   
go to puzzle club where we do          
interesting problems with numbers.     
  Afternoon school starts at 1.10p.m.  
We do topic work like History or       
Geography and then art after break.At  
a quarter to four we go home.I change  
into my playing clothes and watch      
television for a while before I have my
tea.I don't eat much for tea on Friday 
because I go swimming that night at    
Tarleton Baths.                        
  When I come home I have a bath and   
get my hair washed to get rid of the   
chlorine. Then I watch televsion again.
On Fridays my Mum and Dad let me stay  
up a bit later and I go to bed at about
half past ten.(Kirsty Bowles)          </content>
