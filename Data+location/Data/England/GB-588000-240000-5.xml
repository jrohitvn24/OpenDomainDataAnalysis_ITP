post office and 3 public houses who    
brewed their own beer.Houses had oil

rooms,no upstairs lighting and few     
telephones.There were many allotments. 
Industry consisted of farming,a        
radiator factory and the Pot Kilns     
where lime was made.Many roads were    
bordered by fields with only a few     
houses mostly situated along Bures Rd
