		<title>15WAR MEMORIAL ROW IN IBSTOCK</title>
		<content>   Ibstock villagers held a special    
 meeting to decide the future of the   
 war memorial in Central Avenue.       
   Parish councillor Mr Vic Price      
 wanted the monument moved from its    
 position in the centre of the road at 
 the entrance to the community college 
 to a better site, either the cemetery 
 or land in Jacques Street.            
   He complained that the memorial,    
 which bears more than 120 names of    
 lives lost in the First and Second    
 World Wars, was used as an unofficial 
 keep left sign and toilet. Buses also 
 had difficulty getting into the High  
 School car park.                      
   Mr Price argued that the cemetery   
 would be an ideal place for the       
 memorial as it contained 12 war       
 graves.                               
   The meeting decided, however, that  
 the memorial should stay where it is. </content>
