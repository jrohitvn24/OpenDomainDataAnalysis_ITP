		<title>05EMPLOYMENT IN SWANMORE</title>
		<content> We counted 52 different occupations in
 the Village, known to us.  The        
 children interviewed some of the      
 people who work in Swanmore.          
{Ben and Nicholas interviewed Mr. and  
{Mrs. Smith, Dairy Farmers:}They woke  
 up at 5.00 a.m. two mornings ago to   
 find their three bulls had broken down
 a gate and got into the hayfield.     
 They went out and managed to drive    
 them back and mended the gate.  They  
 were about to go to bed when they     
 noticed that a cow had broken through 
 another fence, so they had to mend    
 that too and finally went back to bed 
 at 6.45 a.m.                          
{Sally interviewed the School Cook:}   
 Mrs. Pennial says she loves her work  
 and I saw her do the pizzas.  She     
 doesn't like making pastry, but she   
 likes doing the puddings and the      
 chips.                                </content>
