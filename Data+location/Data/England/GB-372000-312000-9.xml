		<content> Lilleshall Abbey was built in 1150    
 after a Charter issued by King Stephen
 in 1148 mentioned an endowment of     
 Richard de Belmeis to build an abbey. 
 The Abbey was frequently used by      
 passing travellers who were invited in
 to take part in the services and have 
 free hospitality. During the reign of 
 King Henry V111 the Abbey was closed  
 down (1538). Later the King granted   
 the Abbey to Sir William Cavendish who
 dismantled part of it. In 1539 the    
 Abbey was sold to James Leveson of    
 Wolverhampton. During the Civil War   
 Sir Richard Leveson unsuccessfully    
 tried to garrison the building against
 the Parliamentarians. By 1757 the     
 Abbey had fallen into the state it is 
 in now. Between the 2 World Wars a    
 miniature railway used to run from the
 Abbey to Lilleshall Hall. The Ministry
