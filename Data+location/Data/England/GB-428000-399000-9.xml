		<title>09Crane Moor</title>
		<content> Crane Moor is a rather isolated place 
 with only two buses in each direction 
 on a weekday and four on a Saturday.  
 There are about 97 houses in the area.
 Alsothere are five farms around the   
 village,Toad Hall Farm, Crane Greave  
 Farm, Cliffe Farm, Manor Farm and     
 Danes Lane Farm which local people    
 call Dance Lane Farm. Three of these  
 are dairy farms, one is a mixed       
 farmand another is a beef farm. At the
 bottom of the village in Cliffe Avenue
 there are some Airey houses. These    
 were temporarily prefabricated houses 
 put up after the Second World War. As 
 they become empty they are being      
 boarded up ready to be pulled down    
 bEcause they are considered dangerous.
