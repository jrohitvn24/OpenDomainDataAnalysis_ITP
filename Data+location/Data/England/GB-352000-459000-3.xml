Mr.Tim Longton first started going to  
sheepdog trials in 1947,and he has been
going ever since.                      
      He finds it difficult to choose  
which is his favourite dog,but he      
thinks it might be Ken who won the     
Supreme International Champion Shield. 
      At the moment he has got one     
bitch and four dogs.He breeds and      
sells the dogs.A working dog costs 400 
to 500 pounds.The untrained puppies    
cost only 50 pounds.There has been a   
change in the price over the years     
because of inflation.                  
      His favourite award of all the   
ones he has had is the Supreme         
International Champion Shield.One of   
the cups he has won for three years in 
a row and for five years altogether.He 
has had lots of cups but he cannot     
remember how many he has won.          </content>
