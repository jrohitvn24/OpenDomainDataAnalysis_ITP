		<title>14JOYCE WHITMARSH'S DAY</title>
		<content> I wake up at about 5.50 a.m.and do not
 have a breakfast. Then I might do some
 housework  until 8 a.m. At that time I
 then  set  off to work,  which is just
 across   the   road  at  a  commercial
 printers called Newsomes. Half an hour
 for lunch is  just long enough to come
 home for  a light  snack, which I dont
 mind as I am  on a diet. Work finishes
 at 4.30 p.m.  After  work I  come home
 and  prepare a meal for 6 p.m. when my
 husband,  who is an emergency planning
 officer at  County Hall  in Wakefield,
 comes home.  After our evening meal we
 usually  watch  television or read the
 papers.  On the days  I do  not work I
 like to  do a bit of reading, knitting
 or gardening. At night I usually go to
 bed at  11 p.m. but before then I feed
 Heidi, my cat,  and another stray that
 lives with us.{J.Humpleby Batley G.S
