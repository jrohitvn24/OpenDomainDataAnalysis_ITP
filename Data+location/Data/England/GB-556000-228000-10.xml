		<content> No Post Office in the area. Stamped   
 cards letters and small packages can  
 be posted in letter boxes at Cutler's 
 Green, Sibleys Which has 2 post boxes 
 and Sharp's Farm. Post is delivered ti
 all dwellings every day except Sunday,
 and it is quite normal for postmen    
 when they make deliveries, to collect 
 outgoing mail from remote houses.     
 Newspapers are also delivered every   
 day. Cutler's Green has a public      
 telephone box and there are private   
 telephones at many houses and farms in
 this rural locality. Every household  
 has one radio set at the least and    
 most people have television as well.  
 The sets can be hired if preferred and
 it costs less to have a set showing   
 black and white pictures alone,       
 primarily because of a much cheaper   
 licence fee.              RAEY03280663
