		<title>07COMPUTERS IN CARNFORTH</title>
		<content>    The last decade has witnessed      
 increasing growth in computer use both
 in industry and commerce and in the   
 home. Out of the firms we questioned, 
{46.16%}use computers. The first firms 
 to use them were{Nat. West. Bank,     
{Barclays Bank and Savant,}Nat. West.  
 having had theirs 20 years. Most      
 Estate Agents/Bld.Soc., Insurance off.
 and solicitors use them. They are     
 least used in shops where there is    
 currently very little interest . The  
 introduction of computers has neither 
 lost nor created jobs in Carnforth. A 
 survey in school shows that out of 200
 children{61(30.5%)}had computers which
 were mainly used for games. Business  
 computers were used mainly for        
 accounts, wages, orders and issuing   
 tickets for B.R.{Christ Church School}
 has 3 disk driven B.B.C computers all 
 bought within the last nine months.   </content>
