		<title>01Askham Richard/Bryan Area</title>
		<content>  Askham Richard and Askham Bryan are  
 small villages,about two miles        
 apart.They are about five miles       
 south-west of York.                   
  A major road,the A64,runs close to   
 both villages and provides easy access
 to the city of Leeds and to York.     
  Both villages were originally farming
 communities but the number of farms   
 has decreased and many residents now  
 commute to York or Leeds for their    
 work.                                 
  Each village has its own church and  
 they share a primary school which is  
 located in Askham Richard.            
  Until recent times each village had  
 its own shop but only one of these    
 remains,at Askham Bryan. People visit 
 York or Leeds to do their shopping.
