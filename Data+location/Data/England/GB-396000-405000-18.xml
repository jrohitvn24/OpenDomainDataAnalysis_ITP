		<content>  {Whit Friday}is an excitingday for   
 Saddleworth people and is usually     
 taken as a holiday. In the morning the
 congregation from each church forms a 
 procession led by the local{brass     
{band}and they walk through the village
 in a procession of witness to God.    
 Many processions join together for an 
 outdoor service in Uppermill. In the  
 evening each village stages a{brass   
{band contest}at which bands from      
 throughout northern England compete.  
   The{Rushcart festival}is a revival  
 of an ancient custom in which after   
 the harvest the rushes are taken into 
 church as a thanksgiving and to renew 
 the floorcovering.The event takes     
 place at the end of August with groups
 of{Morris Men}pulling the cart through
 the village
