		<title>04Bridge Farm</title>
		<content>    Bridge Farm is run by the tenant   
 farmer and his son. Although they have
 a landrover and tractors to help them 
 at very busy times they may have to   
 work as much as 15 hrs. a day.        
                                       
    They keep 50 dairy cows which      
 produce milk for sale and a flock of  
 300 sheep.  The animals graze on 180  
 acres of the land and 70 acres are    
 used for growing crops of hay,silage, 
 rape and winter and spring barley.    
                                       
    The same family has kept this farm 
 for many years. The present tenant and
 his son have to work very hard but    
 they would not like to change their   
 lives in any way. They deplore the    
 fact that younger village families    
 cannot afford to live here and have to
 seek employment further afield.
