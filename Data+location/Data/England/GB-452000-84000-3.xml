		<content>     The Arreton Valley has, over the  
 past two years, developed into the    
 major garlic growing area in the      
 country.  Studies have been completed 
 into garlic growing methods in the    
 United States of America and the      
 findings have been put to good use by 
 the growers at Mersley Farm,          
 Newchurch. The harvested garlic is    
 exported to many European Countries.  
     Such is the interest in this      
 relatively new crop for the island    
 that it is to host a Garlic Festival  
 in 1985.  The Festival will take place
 in August, is to be sited at Arreton, 
 and it is hoped will be an annual     
 event.  It will take tha form of a    
 country fete with exhibits,           
 games, crafts, sports and children's  
 activities.
