		<content>    VISITORS TO SOMERSET THINK ABOUT,OR
ASK ABOUT CREAM OR CHEESE.AS THEY PASS 
THROUGH THE COUNTRYSIDE THE FIELDS ARE 
MOSTLY MEODOWLAND,AT LEAST THAT IS TRUE
OF THIS AREA.                          
    THE OLD COARSE PERMAMENT PASTURE   
HAS BEEN REPLACED BY THE LUSH GREEN OF 
SOWN GRASSLAND.IN SUMMER,THE MAIN      
VARIATION IS BETWEEN GRAZING LAND AND  
MOWN HAY.                              
    THE MAJORITY OF THE CATTLE ARE THE 
BLACK AND WHITE FREISIONS.THESE ARE    
SEEN FEEDING CONTENDIDLY IN THE FIELDS 
OR AMBLING ALONG THE COUNTRY           
ROADS,HOLDING UP TRAFFIC,ASTHEY ARE    
TAKEN FOR MILKING.                     
    ALONG THE SAME ROADS,TRAVEL THE    
BLUE M.M.B LORRIES TO COLLECT THE MILK 
AND TRANSPORT IT TO THE LOCAL DAIRY FOR
PROCESSING.
