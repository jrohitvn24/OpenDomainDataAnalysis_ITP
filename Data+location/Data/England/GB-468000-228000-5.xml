		<title>05KINGSBRIDGE, STEEPLE CLAYDON</title>
		<content> Kingsbridge Farm is approximately 5   
 miles from Buckingham. It is linked by
 a footbridge to the village of Steeple
 Claydon in whose parish it is. The    
 farm covers 191 acres. Corn is grown  
 on 120 acres and the rest is garden   
 and grassland. Most of the latter is  
 used as grazing for a herd of pedigree
 Hereford cattle.                      
 During the Civil War when Charles I   
 was fleeing from Cromwell's army he   
 crossed the brook at a point near the 
 farm- hence the name "Kingsbridge". In
 about the year 1900 the present       
 farmhouse was converted from a cluster
 of farm cottages which were previously
 owned by the Addington Estate, 3 miles
 to the east. The farm manager lives   
 nearby. The only other dwelling is at 
 Lower Kingsbridge Farm. The farmland  
 has been sold to one of the Oxford    
 Colleges who rent out the fields.     </content>
