		<content>  The annual carnival is held in       
 August. It began in 1955 with a fancy 
 dress parade and pageant, followed by 
 a dance. Most years a procession of   
 floats is held, with a fete, concert  
 and dance.                            
 The Jubilee Club was formed in 1977 to
 commemorate the Queen's silver        
 jubilee. It is held every Thursday in 
 the Public Hall for the elderly people
 of the village and they play cards,   
 invite visitors and chat over a cup of
 tea. They hold a summer outing, a     
 strawberry tea provided by Holsworthy 
 Rotary Club and a Christmas dinner    
 provided by Holsworthy Lions Club.    
 The Women's Institute holds monthly   
 meetings for about 20 members. They   
 learn arts and crafts, hold           
 competitions and invite speakers to   
 address them. They try to support     
 rural life in all ways possible.      </content>
