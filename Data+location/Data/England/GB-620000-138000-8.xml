		<content> St.Luke's Church is a modern building.
 It was built 26 years ago after the   
 former building was burnt down.It is  
 an Anglican Church.                   
   There are no stained glass wondows. 
 The style is very simple.The church   
 faces North, so the traditional East  
 window actually faces to the          
 North.There is a side Chapel in the   
 church.The organ,taken from another   
 church,is 110 years old. There is an  
 RAF flag flying in the church, which  
 was left in Hawkinge when the         
 Aerodrome closed in 1961.             
   There are 2 services on a Sunday    
 and one on a Thursday. There is an    
 active choir. The congregation is     
 usually about 30 people. The church   
 holds over 200 people.                
   The Rector is Rev.John Chittenden.
