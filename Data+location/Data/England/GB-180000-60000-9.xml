		<title>09Newquay-The Town</title>
		<content>    Newquay is situated on the North   
 Cornwall coastline.It has developed on
 a linear plane along the clifftops,   
 with Pentire at one end and St Columb 
 Minor at the other.Most of the        
 clifftop positions are taken by large 
 hotels.The River Gannel borders the   
 southern edge of the town.            
                                       
    Despite the concentration of shops 
 and houses in the town centre,there   
 are also open spaces such as the      
 Killacourt.There is a pedestrian      
 precinct in the main street,which     
 means that traffic has to follow a    
 one-way system around it.             
                                       
    Many of the shops are gift shops,  
 but there are some national chain     
 stores,such as Boots' and Woolworth's,
 as well as local family-owned shops.
