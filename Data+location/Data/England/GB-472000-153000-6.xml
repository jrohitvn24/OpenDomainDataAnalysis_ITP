		<title>06PUBLIC TRANSPORT IN HOOK</title>
		<content> THE RAILWAYS - Mr Mustoe says that the
 railway was an important employer but 
 only two people are working at the    
 station today.The railway used to be  
 the method of transporting flowers    
 each day to Covent Garden. The station
 is still important with commuters into
 London, Farnborough and Basingstoke   
 filling the carpark with cars.The     
 station has recently been repainted in
 brown red and white with hanging      
 baskets above the platforms.Trains    
 leave half hourly to London and       
 Basingstoke with extras at rush hours.
 THE BUSES - Mr Mustoe says there used 
 to be frequent bus service from Hook. 
 Today Alder Valley buses run hourly to
 Basingstoke and Odiham continuing on  
 alternate hours either to Camberley   
 via Hartley Wintney or to Aldershot   
 via Farnham.Sunday and late evening   
 services are infrequent.              </content>
