		<content> When the village expanded around the  
 1700's, the need grew for a building  
 in which societies could hold their   
 meetings. A group called the Village  
 Hall Trust bought eleven acres of land
 and built the village hall. Part of   
 the ground is covered by bowling and  
 tennis greens while the main grass    
 area has cricket and football pitches.
 Many of the village's 35 clubs meet in
 the hall, from a playgroup to a       
 theatre society. 185 children attend  
 cubs, scouts brownies and guides in   
 their own hut not far away. At school 
 15 clubs covering a wide range of     
 interests from needlework to football 
 run during lunch times and after      
 school. On Sunday mornings the two    
 churches run Sunday Schools for       
 children aged five to fourteen.       
  It can be seen that the village is   
 a very lively community.              </content>
