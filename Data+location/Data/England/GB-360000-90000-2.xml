{This is the A38 Exeter to Bournemouth 
 road. At the beginning of the         
 twentieth century there are           
 photographs showing it as a cart      
 track. We did a traffic census in     
 September 1985 for several ten minute 
 periods. The average number of cars   
 passing  going east was forty, the    
 average number of cars going west was 
 ninety six. In the height of summer   
 this number increases.                
 This road divides the village in two. 
 The buildings stretch out along the   
 road and there is no village centre   
 (i.e. village green). In contrast to  
 the Roman road which follows the      
 ridge, the main road follows the      
 valley.
