		<title>01INTRODUCTION TO GLYNDE</title>
		<content> This is a beautiful rural area. In the
 South the Honiton-Folkestone trunk    
 road is being straightened and widened
 below the old road which once went    
 through the village of{Glynde.}To the 
 west,{Mount Caburn}is topped by an    
 iron-age fort, and separates this     
 quiet valley from the ancient county  
 town of Lewes. The area is            
 internationally famous as the         
 breeding ground of the{Southdown      
{sheep.} To the North, {Glyndebourne}  
 brings music-lovers and musicians from
 all over the world to what is unique  
 in 1985, an opera house set in a      
 beautiful garden. The little road from
 Ringmer to Beddingham runs through the
 area from North to South. Parallel to 
 the A27 is the railway line connecting
 Lewes with Eastbourne. {Glynde Reach} 
 runs diagonally from North-East to    
 South-West.                           </content>
