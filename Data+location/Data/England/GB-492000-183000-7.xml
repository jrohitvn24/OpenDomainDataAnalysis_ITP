		<content>BURNHAM BEECHES GOLF CLUB is not       
actually in the Beeches, it is very    
near to it.  Kiln Wood separates the   
Beeches from the club. The club was    
founded early in this century 70 to 80 
years ago. It is very well established 
with 18 holes. Additional interest is  
varied wild life, squirrels, rabbits,  
foxes and Munjac deer, seen on the     
course. Membership fee is 500 pounds   
then 200 pound per year thereafter.    
There is a womans golf section too.    
There is also a 5 day membership, but  
the waiting list is the longest in the 
country. BURNHAM JOGGING CLUB meets in 
the Beeches weekends.JAWS/JOGGERS AND  
WHEELERS CLUB meets Sundays running and
cycling down Dukes Drive, Egypt Lane,  
Hare Hatch Lane and back to Burnham
