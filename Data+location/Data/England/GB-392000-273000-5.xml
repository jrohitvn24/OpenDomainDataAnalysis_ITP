		<content> In Wildmoor there is a pumping station
 to pump underground water into the    
 public water supply. When rain falls  
 on to the ground some of it runs away 
 into streams and rivers and some senks
 into the ground. In Fairfield the     
 underlying rock is a porous sandstone 
 so the rain sinks deep into the rock. 
 To purify the water chlorine is added,
 left for half and hour and then       
 removed by adding sulphur dioxide.    
 This method kills any germs and       
 removes the chlorine taste. Flouride  
 also is added up to the recommended   
 level. The Wildmoor pumping station   
 and the Washingstocks pumping station 
 are controlled by a computer so no-one
 needs to work there. The boreholes are
 70 metres deep.
