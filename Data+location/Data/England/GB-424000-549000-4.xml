		<title>04THE CIVIC CENTRE</title>
		<content>  There has been quite a lot of        
 controversy about the new Civic Centre
 which was opened in 1982.The inside is
 said to look like the a ship's        
 boiler_room because of all the pipes  
 and metal steps.It is nicknamed "THE  
 GREEN HOUSE" because of its glass     
 frontage.It is our most modern        
 building and has won many design      
 awards.The town council meets here to 
 decide how to spend its money.        
 Interviews were held in the town to   
 discover peoples attitude to the Civic
 Centre ect.The most common coment was 
 "IT IS A:WASTE OF PUPLIC MONEY;       
 MONSTROSITY AND AN EYESORE."  60% also
 said public transport was inadequate. 
 The proposed shopping development     
 was criticised.Some people want       
 traffic diverted away from the front  
 street.                               
                                       </content>
