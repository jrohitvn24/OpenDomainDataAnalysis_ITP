		<content> In Churchtown the "Pins and Needles"  
 shop has hand-knitted garments made by
 local people and a range of hand-sewn 
 items - especially in baby wear.      
 The walls of the Cuckoo House         
 Restaurant are adorned with paintings 
 done by many accomplished local       
 artists, many of whom acquired their  
 skills by attending art classes at the
 W.I. Hall.  Mithian has its own studio
 run by Sonia Fynn.                    
 In Vicarage Road, John Vasey runs his 
 pottery at the side of his house.     
 Here the potter's wheel attracts many 
 tourists.  Many items take the shape  
 of the local engine houses!           
 Also in Vicarage Road, Giftcraft      
 displays a wide selection of hand-made
 goods and soft toys such as seals, rag
 dolls, corn dollies and peg dollies;  
 together with a selection of          
 jewellery. All items are made locally.</content>
