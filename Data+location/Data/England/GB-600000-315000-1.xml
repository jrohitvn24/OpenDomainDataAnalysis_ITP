		<content>    Swanton Morley is a large, well    
 scattered village.   In common with   
 many Norfolk villages, it has a wide  
 variety of housing ranging from tied  
 farm cottages to modern estates of    
 private homes.                        
                                       
    The older part of the village      
 surrounds a small village green and   
 overlooks the flood plain of the River
 Wensum.   This is the focal point of  
 the village still, and here are to be 
 found All Saints church, the village  
 hall (formerly the school until 1917),
 a general stores, butcher,            
 greengrocer, bakery and one of the two
 village public houses.                
    The character of the village has   
 been changed by the development of a  
 nearby R.A.F. base involved in service
 research.
