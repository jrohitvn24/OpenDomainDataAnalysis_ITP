		<title>01A DAY IN THE LIFE OF NANCY</title>
		<content> I get up at 7:30 and go down to       
 breakfast. For breakfast I have cereal
 called Corn Flakes. I have them with  
 cold milk. I also have fresh orange   
 juice. I go to school in a car with   
 Mum and two girls. The school I go to 
 is called Therfield. We go swimming in
 a town nearby called Buntingford every
 Tuesday.My best friend is Zoe. School 
 starts at 9:15. Zoe and I check the   
 rainfall gauge first then we have     
 lessons: they are Maths.,English,     
 Interest,Computer &amp; Science. We have  
 two types of Maths.,one is called     
 Beta, the other is called Fletcher. I 
 like Interest best, you learn about   
 countries &amp; animals &amp; write about     
 them.On Friday we have a special      
 Maths. test. I like going on the      
 computer as well:we have lots of      
 computer games. I get home at 3:30 &amp;  
 watch television &amp; play my recorder.  </content>
