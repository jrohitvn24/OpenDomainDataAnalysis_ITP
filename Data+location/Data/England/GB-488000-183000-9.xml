 cygnets are caught and marked with a  
 nick in the beak by the               
 representatives of the three owners   
 who row up the{Thames}between{Sunbury 
 and Pangbourne.Six boats carry men in 
 brightly coloured uniform carrying    
 banners marked with their respective  
 company insignias up the river on a   
 six day journey during which they mark
 all cygnets with one or two nicks     
 according to the parent swans.Swans   
 with two marks belong to the{Vintners 
 and those with one to the{Dyers.      
   There is great concern for the      
 welfare of the swans at present as    
 many are being poisoned by lead       
 weights used by fishermen.Over the    
 past five to ten years the population 
 of the birds in this country has      
 fallen by about forty percent.
