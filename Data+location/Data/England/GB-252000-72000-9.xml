		<content> Two industries have left their mark on
 the land, namely quarrying and        
 tin-streaming, the former being fairly
 prominent. There are 5 derelict quarry
 sites, some having been worked into   
 the late 1950s. As well as the        
 excavations produced by quarrying,    
 there are large heaps of waste        
 material. Some are in rather isolated 
 places, with the remains of tracks    
 leading to them. There instances of   
 partly-finished blocks of granite     
 lying around. One quarry adjacent to  
 the former Yelverton-Princetown       
 railway, the track of which is easily 
 discernible, provides a popular route 
 for walking on the moors. The quarry  
 had its own sidings. Tin streaming is 
 evident along the sides of the        
 watercourses by the waste thrown aside
 by the men working this method of     
 winning tin.                          </content>
