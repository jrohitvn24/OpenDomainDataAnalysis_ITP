		<title>03GRAVEL PITS -BLACK PUDDINGS</title>
		<content> The influence of the early landowners 
 can be seen when the deeds of many of 
 the new and old houses are inspected. 
 Should anyone wish to follow the      
 traditions of forbearers by making    
 their own black puddings - this is    
 prohibited !( One can imagine the     
 looks on the faces of the church      
 congregation when the stench of boiled
 pigs blood, being mixed with oatmeal, 
 drifted into the church.)             
   The gravel pits were opened in 1947.
 These border onto the North of the    
 village.Heavy trucks plying from the  
 quarries are banned from using village
 roads.                                
   As pits were abandonded they slowly 
 returned to a natural state.These are 
 now nature conservation zones.However,
 two areas this year have opened as    
 water sports centres for the general  
 public.                 Natasha Barlow</content>
