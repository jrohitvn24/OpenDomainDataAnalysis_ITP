		<title>11      Village Life.</title>
		<content> Life in a village is very different   
 from that in a town. The roads are    
 less busy and most people know        
 everyone else.                        
   You have village shops, pubs and a  
 Doctors surgery. Everyone in the      
 village is very friendly and if       
 someone is ill people ask if there is 
 anything that they can do.            
   The countryside around our village  
 is very beautiful with lots of trees  
 and sweet smelling flowers. Also there
 are lots of farms, and they have cows 
 and sheep grazing in their fields.    
   In our village they have a Sunday   
 school and a playgroup. Also they have
 clubs in the village hall like        
 badminton, majorettes and many others.
 Village life is very quiet and        
 peaceful.
