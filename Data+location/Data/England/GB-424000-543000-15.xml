		<title>15OUR SCHOOL</title>
		<content> In 1877 there was a Board school at   
 Framwellgate Moor.It had one class for
 boys,one class for girls and one for  
 infants.The pupils studied            
 cookery,nature,gardening,history,geogr
 aphy,grammar,reading,writing and      
 arithmetic.At first they wrote on     
 slates but by 1882 copy books were    
 used.In those days some children      
 started school at the age of 9.       
 The payment by results system was     
 used.In 1880 the grant to the school  
 was Â£126 but,in 1894,it was cut to Â£44
 because of poor results.In 1881 the   
 heating had been inadequate.The ink   
 used by the pupils froze.             
 By 1957 all children in the district  
 attended the school.It continued to   
 develop and today there are modern    
 buildings housing infants,juniors and 
 a comprehensive on one campus.
