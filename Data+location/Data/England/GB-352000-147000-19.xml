		<title>19SILVER JUBILEE WOOKEY HOLE</title>
		<content>  1977 WAS THE YEAR THAT THE AREA      
 CAME ALIVE AS A COMMUNITY. THE        
 WOOKEY HOLE SILVER JUBILEE COMMITTEE, 
 WHICH INCLUDED ENTHUSIASTIC "LOCALS"  
 SUCH AS THE VILLAGE DOCTOR,HEADMASTER 
 AND HEALTH INSPECTOR, WAS FORMED TO   
 ARRANGE THE CELEBRATIONS.             
  ONE EVENING THERE WAS A COMIC        
 FOOTBALL MATCH, BETWEEN THE "MORTAR   
 BOARD MARVELS" AND THE "WOOKEY HOLE   
 WONDERS".THE NATIONAL GAME WAS NOTHING
 LIKE THIS; AN ASSORTED BUNCH, OF      
 EITHER SEX, PLAYING OUTSIDE THE RULES!
  ON A MORE CULTURAL LEVEL A FASHION   
 SHOW DELIGHTED THOSE INTERESTED IN THE
 LATEST STYLES AT PRICES UNAFFORDABLE. 
  IN THE AFTERNOON OF THE "DAY"        
 A CHILDREN'S FETE WAS HELD WITH A     
 MARQUEE FOR TEAS. DURING THE EVENING  
 THE JUBILEE SUPPER FOLLOWED BY DANCING
 WAS A FINALE TO A WONDERFUL WEEK .
