		<title>11 SUNDAY  SERVICE</title>
		<content> We are a Christian family and so every
 Sunday we attend Church and go to the 
 Salvation Army in Staines.            
 In the morning at 10.00 there is a    
 Sunday School for the children and at 
 the sametime the band goes to a street
 near the Hall and conducts an open air
 meeting. After this there is a main   
 meeting in the Hall at 11.00. This    
 concludes at about midday.            
 After lunch there is an afternoon     
 Sunday School at 2.30 and again the   
 band goes out for an 'open-air'. Twice
 a month a Praise meeting is held at   
 3.30 which usually lasts for about an 
 hour. The evening meeting begins at   
 6pm with the band sometimes going to  
 Ashford Hospital beforehand. After the
 meeting at around 8pm a group of us   
 aged between 14-25 go around to       
 someone's house for coffee and to     
 relax.                                </content>
