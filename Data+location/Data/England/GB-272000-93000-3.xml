		<content> The wooded northern foothills of      
 Dartmoor have changed perhaps the     
 least over the passing years. The     
 close network of small rural roads are
 quite well-maintained and through the 
 increase in time for leisure today,   
 the area has been opened for walking, 
 and the enjoyment and study of        
 wildlife and its conservation. The    
 Two-Moors Way, a footpath crossing    
 from Dartmoor to Exmoor, winds its way
 through the region using some ancient 
 tracks as well as the small rural     
 roads. There are many relics of the   
 old deciduous woodland, mainly oak;   
 their associated habits provide not   
 only interest for residents and       
 visitors alike but also havens where  
 all forms of wildlife can be          
 discovered and can continue to live   
 relatively undisturbed.
