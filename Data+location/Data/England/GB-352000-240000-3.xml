		<content>    The flood plain of the River Lugg, 
 known locally as the Lugg Flats,      
 dominates the area and a high         
 proportion of the land is water-logged
 for much of the year or subject to    
 flooding. Land adjacent to the Flats  
 is often steep.                       
    A small area of arable land lies   
 between Lugwardine and Withington.    
    Land types determine agricultural  
 practice.                             
    Steep slopes and land likely to    
 become wet or flooded is kept under   
 permanent grass. Much of this land is 
 fenced and utilised by beef cattle and
 some sheep.                           
    The arable land carries cereals in 
 rotation with grass leys. Some        
 dairying is practiced here but the    
 Milk Quota System introduced by the   
 EEC has had disastrous consequences on
 this enterprise for small farmers.    </content>
