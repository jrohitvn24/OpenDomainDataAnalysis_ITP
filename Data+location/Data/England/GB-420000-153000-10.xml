		<title>10The Church at Coll.Kingston</title>
		<content> St. Mary's Church at Collingbourne    
 Kingston founded in Norman times      
 contains an early English Chancel and 
 has a perpendicular tower. The        
 memorials include a 17th century      
 canopied tomb and 19th and 20th       
 century stained glass windows. The    
 latest of these dedicated in l985     
 contrasts sharply with the other      
 windows. Here the design is based on  
 abstract ideas of the ministry.       
 In spite of the decline in attendance 
 the church is actively used for       
 weddings, baptisms and funeral        
 services.  Unfortunately, at the      
 present time, there is no choir but   
 the six bells, the oldest dating from 
 1641, have been rung on special       
 occasions since the tower was built.  
 This makes bell_ringing the only      
 secular church activity to have       
 survived the centuries.               </content>
