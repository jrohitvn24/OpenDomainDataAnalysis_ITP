		<content>   Music plays an important part in the
 cultural life of the Brighouse area.  
 The Brighouse and Rastrick Brass Band 
 is internationally famous. There are  
 also a number of very successful      
 marching bands in the district, who   
 compete at national level. The        
 Brighouse Amateur Light Opera Society 
 makes regular musical offerings to    
 appreciative audiences, as do many    
 other local choral groups.            
   Amateur dramatics is another facet  
 of the town's leisuretime activities. 
 There are a number of flourishing     
 local societies, not the least of     
 which is the Brighouse Children's     
 Theatre where young talent is fostered
 to good advantage.                    
   The Art Society holds regular       
 meetings and exhibitions. Examples of 
 some of the work of its members were  
 recently hung in the House of Commons.</content>
