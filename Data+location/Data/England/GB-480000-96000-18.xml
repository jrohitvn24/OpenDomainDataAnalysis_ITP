		<title>18WITTERINGS HEALTH CENTRE</title>
		<content>   We discovered that 8000 patients are
 registered at the Health Centre and   
 that there are four doctors to deal   
 with them.In the Summer when many     
 holiday makers arrive the doctors may 
 expect to see 3000 of them for such   
 things as sunburn,bee stings,cuts from
 broken glass or medicine that they    
 have forgotten to bring away with     
 them.The doctors will see forty to    
 fifty people a day and patients visit 
 the them,on average,four to six times 
 a year.                               
   Also at the Health Centre people can
 be given help and advice by either of 
 the two health visitors there or can  
 see a nurse,a social worker,a         
 chiropodist,a midwife,a speech therap-
 ist or a psychologist.We found out    
 that an increasing number of patients 
 are elderly and 28% of the Witterings 
 patients are over the age of 65.      </content>
