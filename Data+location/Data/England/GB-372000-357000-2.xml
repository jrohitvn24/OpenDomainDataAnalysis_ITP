		<title>02The Wheelock By-Pass</title>
		<content>{Sandbach}and{Wheelock}need a{By-Pass  
 because of the heavy traffic between  
{Crewe}and the{Sandbach}M.6            
 interchange.Right from the begining   
 there were 4 possible routes.The red  
 ,green,purple and orange routes.All of
 the routes will cost about 5 million  
 pounds.The green route will go right  
 through someones house.The red route  
 will go around the back of both       
 Sandbach (the main town) and Wheelock 
 (the village).The green route and     
 red route people went to a lot of     
 trouble to draw up maps and charts to 
 show the different routes.Most people 
 seemed to favour the red route but the
 Cheshire councillors chose the green  
 route.Besides the By-Pass there is an 
 inner road which takes traffic away   
 from the centre of Sandbach.Some of   
 the people of Sandbach complained     
 about the noise of the diggers.       </content>
