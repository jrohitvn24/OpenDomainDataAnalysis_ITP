		<title>05Pheasant Rearing.</title>
		<content>In February and March the gamekeeper   
collects hen pheasants,cuts their      
flight feathers on one wing and keeps  
the birds in a holding pen.Cock        
pheasants are also collected.There are 
600 hens in the pens at Dairy Lane at  
present.In April the eggs are collected
from the ground.As there may be as many
as 21 eggs in one clutch,additional    
help is required to collect and        
transfer them to an incubator.Lord     
Hambleden's incubator can accommodate  
8000 eggs on trays which are tipped    
automatically twice a day.When hatched,
the chicks are transferred to brooder  
houses in fields.After 7 weeks,the     
chicks are taken to release pens,6 feet
high, in the woods.The flight feathers 
are pulled and they are fed and        
watered.Three months later the wires   
are laid down and the birds come and   
go as they wish.                       </content>
