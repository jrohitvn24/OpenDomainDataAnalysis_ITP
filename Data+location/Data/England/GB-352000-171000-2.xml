		<content>{Country }or {Rural postmen}normally   
 work from a village Post Office and   
 do deliveries on a bike or in         
 a van.The Failand,Abbot and Leighwoods
 areas are an exception to this, these 
 areas are delivered from Clifton      
 delivery office by postmen driving    
 vans.Long Ashton is delivered to by   
 postmen working from the local        
 P.O.some on foot and some on bikes.{  
{Rural Postmen} also differ from town  
 postmen because they deliver parcels  
 as well as letters.They sell stamps   
 and postal orders and they accept     
 parcels for posting.The postman who   
 delivers to Failand starts work at    
 05.30am and has to sort the letters   
 for his own delivery into a delivery  
 order before going out to deliver     
 them.After completing their rounds    
 they have to make a collection from   
 the local Post boxes.                 </content>
