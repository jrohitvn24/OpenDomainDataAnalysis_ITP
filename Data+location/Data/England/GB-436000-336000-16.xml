 Roller World costs Â£1.40 but if you   
 haven't got any roller boots you can  
 hire them for 30p. It starts at 2.00  
 p.m. and lasts 3 hours. There is a    
 cafe and two rinks, one small one for 
 practice and one large one. Everybody 
 goes round in the same direction.     
 Next door there is a{snooker hall.}   
                                       
{A budding footballer writes:}         
 I play football, you need to have a   
 lot of skill. I play for the Junior   
 Rams. We finished third in our league.
 Our football pitch is at Parkers Piece
 and our season starts again in August.
                                       
 There are many pitches on the{race    
{course}adjoining the cricket ground.  
 They cater for football, cricket      
 and hockey and are available for clubs
 to hire.                              </content>
