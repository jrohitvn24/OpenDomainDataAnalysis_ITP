		<title>07WOODFORD COTTAGE INDUSTRY</title>
		<content>   Some months ago a man started a     
 cottage industry in the village. He   
 makes wooden garden furniture. He is  
 using a disused building (previously  
 the village smithy for several hundred
 years) which is near the main road.   
 Inside his tiny building there are    
 planks of wood leaning against the    
 walls.  He buys the pine wood from    
 Southampton and takes about ten days  
 to make small garden tables, chairs,  
 benches and picnic tables. All this is
 done by himself and another man, using
 an electric saw. While they are       
 working there is a pleasant smell of  
 sawdust. This wooden furniture is     
 treated so that it can be left out in 
 all weathers.                         
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
