		<title>12Old Homes in Well</title>
		<content> Well (Saxon Welle) had a spring       
 emerging from the limestone rocks near
 Masham Lane.Early Christians dedicated
 the well to St.Michael.Water now flows
 into a culvert coming out beyond the  
 mere as a stream through the village  
{St. Michael's Cottages, Well}         
 In 1342 Ralph Neville founded and     
 endowed a hospital dedicated to St.   
 Michael the Archangel.This was rebuilt
 in 1758 as a row of 8 almshouses,     
 recently modernised to make 4 central 
 heated cottages.They are let at a     
 nominal rent to any suitable elderly  
 person and are run by the trustees of 
 United Charities,Well. The tiny chapel
 adjoining once used daily by hospital 
 inmates is now used by the Junior     
 Church.                               
{Well Hall}- The outstanding feature is
 the vaulted room.It became a school   
 for young gentlemen in 17th century.  </content>
