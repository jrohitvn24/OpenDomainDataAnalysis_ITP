		<title>16GIRL GUIDES IN 1985.</title>
		<content>      My name is Claire Nicholas and I 
 live at "The Jays", Upper Langwith    
 with my parents, grandma and brother  
 Alistair, who is fifteen.             
      My parents take me to Pleasley   
 every week to join in with the Guides 
 there. It takes about ten minutes to  
 get there so I start at 6.50pm to get 
 there at 7.00pm.When I get there we   
 have to wait until the Brownies have  
 finished, then we go in. If it is warm
 we go for a walk in the woods or go   
 tracking, which is marking a trail by 
 making arrows out of chalk or things  
 of nature like twigs or stones. Ten   
 minutes later other Guides have to    
 follow your trail. Some people call   
 this "hare and hounds".               
      Sometimes we have a tester who   
 comes to test us for our badges.
