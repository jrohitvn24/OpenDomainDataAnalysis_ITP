		<content> Now I am 11 I am leaving{Warren Hills 
{School.}What I have enjoyed most is   
 science and using the computer for    
 project work.I have been on lots of   
 trips with the School but my favourite
 was our week in London.               
 Things I will always remember about   
 Warren Hills are starting (I was very 
 frightened but soon made friends),    
 class assemblies,swimming,school      
 sports and the discos.                
 I don't always like playtime because  
 it is often cold but outside we play  
 marbles,kiss-chase,British Bulldog,   
 tig,football and other ball games.    
 One thing I won't miss are the School 
 dinners;although there is a choice of 
 meal I prefer to bring sandwiches.    
 It is strange to think that when I    
 started School I couldn't read or     
 write yet now I'm ready to go to the  
 High School.                          </content>
