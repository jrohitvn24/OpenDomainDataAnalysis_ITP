		<content> Roads built especially for fast       
traffic are known  as motorways in     
Britain, autobahns in Germany,and      
expressways, freeways or turnpikes in  
the United States.These roads are      
designed to let cars travel at high    
speeds with maximum safety.Motorways   
usually have three or more lanes going 
in each direction.Often a barrier or a 
strip of land separates the cars going 
in one direction  from the traffic     
coming  towards them .Other roads cross
over or under the motorway .There are  
no  intersections.Traffic enters or    
leaves the motorway at carefully       
designed junctions .                   
The motorway known as the M6 passes    
through our area .This section of the  
M6 was built in 1962 as the Stafford   
By-Pass because of traffic problems in 
Stafford Town centre caused by vehicles
