		<content>This is a residential area which has   
many appearances of a village. The     
houses tend to be rather larger than   
those in nearby estates and are all    
privately owned. People living in this 
area say it is a pleasant, quiet area  
to live in, and they tend to be older  
and retired. Although it lies close to 
the A5 the area is surprisingly quiet  
with little traffic noise carrying from
the main road. The main problem in the 
Bonehill area, according to the        
residents is the lack of Amenities.    
Apart from a small village green on    
which stands a phone box and a post box
there is nothing. Residents say they   
have to travel to Fazeley or Mile Oak  
for the nearest shops and even then you
can't always get what you want.
