		<title>10Wood carving</title>
		<content>   We interviewe{Mr Short}about this   
 ancient art and he told us that he    
 uses{English}woods such as{Yew, Apple,
{Cherry and Ash.}He uses{yew}when he   
 wants two colours of wood in his      
 carving. It takes longer to do a      
 small, intricate carving than a large,
 simple one. He polishes his carvings  
 with a mixture of{bees' wax and turp- 
{entine.}He starts by looking at what  
 he wants to carve for about fifteen   
 minutes, and after  sketching it on   
 the wood he carves out what he wants  
 with a{gouge.                         
    He uses a{Chinese}sign called a    
{'ying and yang'}as a trade mark.He    
 gats most of his ideas from           
 illustrations in books and in his     
 twenty year occupation he has made    
 about{600}models. He was not at all   
 interested in carpentry as a boy.
