		<content> The original church of St John The    
 Baptist in Barlaston was situated on  
 the outskirts of the village and over 
 the last few years suffered severe    
 structural damage due to mine workings
 underground. A temporary church was   
 built along side and was used until   
 November 1984 when the new church was 
 opened near the centre of the village.
   The finance for this building came  
 from the National coalboard and great 
 care was taken with the foundations to
 ensure this did not happen again.     
   The original six bells from the old 
 church have been transfered to the new
 building which are rung regularly by  
 the bell ringing team.                
   Church activities include Mother's  
 Union an active church choir and a    
 youth club for the teen ages.
