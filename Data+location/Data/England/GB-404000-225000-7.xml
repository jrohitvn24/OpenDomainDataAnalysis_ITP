		<content> Badgers and Foxes are common, and     
 fallow Deer are sometimes seen in     
 Guiting Wood.  Butterflies do well and
 those seen include Marbled White,     
 Brimstone, Small Copper and Peacock.  
 There is a rich variety of plant life.
 The natural woodland where it has been
 left undisturbed is Beech.  Guiting   
 Wood is rich in Bluebells, and also   
 has wild aquilegia and Herb Paris.    
 Other plants found include Wild Thyme 
 and Rock Roses.  Orchids also thrive, 
 there are several speices to be found 
 including early Purple Orchids,       
 Butterfly Orchids and Pyrmidal        
 Orchids.                              
 The natural Beech woodland is however 
 in process of being replaced by       
 Coniferous Fir and Larch which are    
 planted for profit.
