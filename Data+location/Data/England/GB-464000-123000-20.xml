		<title>20EAST MEON PARISH</title>
		<content>   Long-time residents are quick to    
 point out that the eastern half of the
 area is within the parish of East Meon
 and comes under the District Council  
 of Petersfield, whereas West Meon is  
 administered from Winchester.         
   Just inside the boundary is Westbury
 Park, part of an enormous barony at   
 the time of the Domesday Book. The    
 present House was built around the    
 beginning of the 17th century, though 
 extensively rebuilt after a fire in   
 1904. From 1926 until the late 1970's 
 it housed a preparatory school. Now it
 is a nursing home with around 80      
 residents, providing some much needed 
 employment.                           
   In the grounds is the ruin of       
 St.Nicholas's Chapel, a 13th century  
 building which was still intact in    
 1703, but which is now badly          
 deteriorated.                         </content>
