		<title>17Norton Fitzwarren School</title>
		<content>   Norton Fitzwarren Primary School was
 built in 1872.  We were told by the   
 headmaster that in 1948               
  there was going to be a new school   
 built but nothing was done about it.  
   Children start at the age of 4 and  
 they are looked after by a total of 13
 full- and part-time staff.  The       
 children enjoy Science, Craft, and    
 P.E. and they like sport although they
 say that they do not have enough.     
   There are between 70 and 80 pupils. 
 The school has an outdoor swimming    
 pool which the children like to use.  
   At the age of 11, children leave the
 school and go to such secondary       
 schools as Ladymead, Bishop Fox's and 
 Priorswood.  Most children go to      
 Ladymead.  Occasionally some children 
 go to private schools such as Taunton 
 School, King's, and Queen's Colleges.
