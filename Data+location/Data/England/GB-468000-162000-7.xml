		<content> The land around Beech Hill is slightly
 rolling, but flat in some places.     
 There are some marshy areas, such as  
 'the Pit', but most of the land is    
 quite fertile. There are four ponds in
 and around the village of Beech Hill  
 and there are also six streams running
 through our area. The land itself is  
 good for crops and livestock. It      
 drains very well in places, but very  
 badly in others.Ther are a couple of  
 areas of woodland, but it is mostly   
 open fields.                          
                                       
  The scenery is typical of Hampshire. 
 There is one main road (A33) which    
 leads to Reading, all other roads are 
 small country lanes.  There are few   
 houses. There are eight bridges and   
 running through the southern part of  
 our section is a Roman road called    
 'Devil's Highway'.                    </content>
