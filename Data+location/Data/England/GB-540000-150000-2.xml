		<content>   Limited changes and growth has been 
 seen. A railway in 1884 and houses    
 were built around there. There were   
 big houses with fields. Now there are 
 housing estates. Local schools are    
{Merle Common, Beadles Lane}and{Oxted  
{County.}This was one big building and 
 later extra huts were built. Now      
 there are middle schools in the area. 
 There were less shops{Butchers, Farm  
{shops}(most jobs were for farmers),   
{Grocers}and a{Fish shop.}Now there are
 16 shops including hairdressers. Many 
 roads are named after landmarks. Most 
 of them are now housing estates. Buses
 used to come every 15 minutes, now it 
 is every hour. The population has     
 increased and new estates have been   
 built to house them. After the war an 
 industrial estate was built. Many     
 people nearby work here. Other people 
 work in places reached by rail.       </content>
