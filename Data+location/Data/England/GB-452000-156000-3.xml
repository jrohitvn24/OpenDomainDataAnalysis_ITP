		<content>  The{Methodist church}is also flint-  
 built, and stands in the Square.      
 Services are held on Sunday mornings, 
 and at the same time children of the  
 Sunday-school meet in the School-room.
 This caters for children of both the  
 Methodist church and St. Mary's. There
 is also a Women's Fellowship which    
 meets on Wednesdays. The schoolroom is
 used by other groups in the village as
 a meeting-place.                      
  The{Roman Catholic church}occupies   
 what was once the village hall,       
 although it was privately run.        
 Services are held on Sundays and      
 Thursdays, and the priest comes from  
 the church at Tadley.  As well as the 
 church, there is a club where people  
 can buy drinks and play games, and    
 this has become an important social   
 centre for the village.
