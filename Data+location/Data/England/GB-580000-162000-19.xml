		<title>19MOTORWAY THOUGHTS (1)</title>
		<content> The Motorway is a fast dangerous      
 place, destroying all in its          
 path.Cutting through trees and fields 
 to make more room, sticking its long, 
 broad body where it pleases, with     
 houses following close behind like    
 servants of a King.The world is       
 shrinking because of this grave       
 giant.It runs in a straight line      
 through the fields, through a forest  
 of beautiful trees, straight to its   
 destination.If someone's house is     
 blocking the path it will kick them   
 out and smash it to the ground.If a   
 hill stands tall and firm it will dig 
 its way through it.Yes, the world is  
 shrinking because of this grave       
 giant,the fast,dangerous motorway.
