		<content> Although on the main Leicester to     
 London railway there is no operational
 station in the block,the nearest being
 either Leicester or Market Harborough 
 each some 10 miles distant. The block 
 also contains part of the Grand Union 
 Canal but the main form of transport  
 remains the motor car. There are no   
 services for motor transport in the   
 block but they are available close    
 by. The block contains part of the A50
 trunk road (leicester to Northampton).
 The remainder are minor roads linking 
 with the surrounding villages of      
 Countesthorpe,Great Glen,Kibworth     
 Beauchamp and Fleckney. Many of these 
 are difficult to drive on owing to    
 many sharpe bends and narrow          
 lanes.Many of the roads in the block  
 are heavily used as commuter routes   
 especially the A50 which is           
 considered a dangerous road.          </content>
