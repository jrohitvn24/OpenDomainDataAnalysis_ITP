		<title>01Prestwood - Brief outline</title>
		<content>The area we live in is mostly          
agricultural and wooded. Prestwood     
village has grown much larger since    
World War II. Most houses in our       
village were built since 1950, both    
council and private types. Private     
houses cost from 40,000 pounds upwards.
Building continues but mostly to the   
S.E. of our grid. Most people living   
here work outside of this area. In     
1881 there were less than 800 people in
Prestwood, most employed in            
agriculture. Much of our text is about 
children in Prestwood. Our school is   
200 metres outside of the most S.E.    
Km. Square of our grid. We decided we  
would use Domesday to find out some    
facts about ourselves. The beautiful   
countryside in our area is shown in    
our photographs. We do have easy       
access to London, and High Wycombe is  
our nearest town.                      </content>
