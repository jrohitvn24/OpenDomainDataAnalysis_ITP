		<title>12WILDLIFE IN THE NEW FOREST</title>
		<content>   On the walk from Beaulieu to our    
 school I saw lots of ponies and       
 foals with their mothers.I saw        
 some cows but not very many.There was 
 some donkeys but not many.It was very 
 hot and all of my class had to walk at
 least four miles.I saw some spiders   
 carrying egg sacks.Some were carrying 
 blue egg sacks some were carrying     
 white and some were carrying a creamy 
 colour. I walked on and I saw an ants 
 nest and where all the ants had been  
 walking there was white dust whereas  
 the rest was a dark grey colour.When  
 we were nearly back at school I saw   
 about six mole hills and one was      
 freshly made.                         
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
