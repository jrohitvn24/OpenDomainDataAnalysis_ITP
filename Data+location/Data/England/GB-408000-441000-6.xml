		<content> There is a large hole in the hillside 
 where the water wheel was,and on the  
 wall are friction marks where the     
 spindle of the wheel has rubbed       
 against it. The wheel has been taken  
 away.                                 
 There are the foundations of a small  
 row of houses.A very small village was
 formed around the mill for the        
 workers.                              
 There is a small housing estate, and  
 the houses are very spacious and are  
 well designed.The estate is called    
 Sunnydale Park.                       
 The mill is not as big as modern      
 factories are today,and has a nice    
 setting.There are still under ground  
 tunnels where the water used to run   
 down and supply the water wheel with  
 power to work the machinery.
