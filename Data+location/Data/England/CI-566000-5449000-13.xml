		<title>13ST SAVIOUR'S HOSPITAL</title>
		<content>  St Saviour's hospital is part of the 
 Jersey group of hospitals. The        
 hospital opened in 1868 under the name
 of the Jersey Lunatic Asylum with just
 12 patients.                          
  In 1890 a law was introduced         
 providing for certification of        
 patients on admission to the asylum   
 and they remained there until they    
 were discharged or died.              
  During 1891 and 1911 extensions were 
 added to the building and this forms  
 the main part today. In 1952 the name 
 was changed to the Jersey Mental      
 Hospital and in 1963, to try and      
 remove the social stigma attached to  
 mental illness, it was again changed  
 this time to St Saviour's Hospital.   
   Between 1960 and 1980 further       
 buildings were added. Including a new 
 indoor heated pool and a children's   
 unit.                                 </content>
