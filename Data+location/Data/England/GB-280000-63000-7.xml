		<title>07Hunters Lodge -Thatching</title>
		<content> We went to Hunters Lodge to see a     
 thatcher at work.  He has been        
 thatching for eleven years.  He uses  
 water-reed from Austria which is long,
 strong and usually lasts for 15 years.
 It is water-resistant which makes it  
 ideal for thatching, but it is easily 
 cracked.  He also uses wheat straw.   
 This is expensive and lasts for 6     
 years but bends easily so he uses it  
 for the ridge with wire-netting to    
 keep the birds off.  He uses a boning 
 knife to trim the straw around the    
 chimney.  The reeding pin is stuck in 
 to hold the reed in place while he    
 puts in hazel spars which have been   
 split and twisted to be stuck in the  
 thatch to hold it there.  A biddle is 
 a tool which is stuck into the thatch 
 and the thatcher stands on it.  Alan  
 has twelve which he uses as a roof    
 ladder.  Thatching is not an easy job.</content>
