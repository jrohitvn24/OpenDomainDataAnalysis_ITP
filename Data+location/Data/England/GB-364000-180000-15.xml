		<content> 12.45pm. Started to prepare lunch. (I 
 am starving!)                         
 1.20pm. Lunch. Roast chicken followed 
 by ice cream. After lunch I tidied up 
 and popped around to Amy's Grandma's  
 house two doors away where Amy's Great
 Granny had come to lunch. She is 85   
 years old, and we have to shout to    
 make her hear us.                     
 3.00pm. We have decided to go to      
 Berkeley Castle as the weather is not 
 too good. One minute it is sunny and  
 the next it is raining. First stop the
 garage for some sweets for the        
 journey.I wasn't allowed any,(I'm     
 trying to lose weight.) Then on to the
 castle.                               
 3.30pm.We had a guided tour around the
 castle. It is very interesting and    
 then we looked around the grounds.    
 As we left the castle it started to   
 rain.                                 </content>
