		<title>19THE CHURCH OF FOREST TOWN</title>
		<content>{THE CHURCH OF ST.ALBANS}WAS BUILT IN  
 1911 WITH MONEY DONATED BY THE DUKE OF
 PORTLAND.THE CHURCH OCCUPIES A CENTRAL
 POSITION IN THE VILLAGE OF FOREST TOWN
 AND WAS ERECTED PRIMARILY TO SERVE THE
 SPIRITUAL NEEDS OF THE LOCAL MINERS   
 WHO HAD MOVED INTO THE AREA TO WORK AT
 THE NEW PIT.                          
 WITH THE OPENING OF CROWN FARM PIT    
 ACCOMMODATION WAS ALSO PROVIDED,SET   
 OUT IN 9 AVENUES,THE FIRST TWO ESPECI_
 ALLY FOR THE DEPUTIES.THE CHURCH WAS  
 INTERWOVEN INTO THE VILLAGE LIFE AS IT
 WAS EXPECTED THAT MINERS WOULD ATTEND 
 SERVICES OR ELSE LOSE PAY. THE PLACE  
 OF THE CHURCH IN THE SOCIETY HAS      
 CHANGED OVER THE YEARS,WITH THE       
 CONGREGATION OF 80 BEING THE SAME     
 NUMBER AS THAT OF 30 YEARS AGO.THE    
 GRAVE YARD STILL OFFERS PLOTS FOR     
 BURIAL FOR THE NEXT 30 YEARS WHILE    
 MANY OTHER CHURCH GROUNDS ARE FULL.   </content>
