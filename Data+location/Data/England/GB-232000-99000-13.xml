		<title>13LEISURE IN CLAWTON</title>
		<content>  {Clawton}is a rural area so it has   
 its advantages and disadvantages as   
 far as leisure is concerned. Its      
 advantages are that we can go{fishing 
 in the{River Claw},hunting in the     
  woods and there are several walks    
 around{Clawton}as well.If you want    
 entertainment there is a{Parish Hall  
 and there are Church services on      
 Sundays.There is always the{television
 to watch.We also have{beaches}near    
 us.                                   
    Its disadvantages are that it has  
 no pub,no Sports Centre, (unless you  
 go to{Holsworthy})and no swimming     
 pool.There are no theatres,no discos  
 or night clubs, only a small library  
 in the nearby town of Holsworthy.
