		<content> Lacock's policeman is stationed at    
 Corsham and is also concerned with    
 Gastard and other nearby villages.    
 There are a dozen men and three cars  
 at Corsham police station.            
 Additional man power, cars, dogs,     
 horses etc. are brought in from       
 Chippenham or Bristol as necessary.   
 The{crime rate}in Lacock is not very  
 high and there is rarely a serious    
 offence to investigate.  The          
 policeman does a good job in getting  
 to know the people in the area.  He   
 spent an afternoon in school talking  
 to the children and showing them all  
 his{safety equipment.} Truncheons,    
 handcuffs and riot protection are     
 otherwise just known to the children  
 through television.  Particularly of  
 interest was the tie which clips on to
 avoid the possible danger of          
 strangling.                           </content>
