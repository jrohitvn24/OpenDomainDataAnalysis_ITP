		<content> Woodhall Spa has a population of some 
 2500 and is located in the East       
 Lindsey district of Lincolnshire,lying
 almost centrally within the county.The
 area is mainly rural with farming     
 being an important occupation.The city
 of Lincoln lies 19 miles away with the
 market towns of Boston being 17 and   
 Horncastle 6 miles distant.The area   
 around the village is mainly flat with
 the fen lands lying to the south,but  
 to the north the land rises to the    
 hills of the Lincolnshire Wolds.      
 The village began as a spa and this,  
 together with its unpolluted air,has  
 led to it being registered as one of  
 the four healthiest places in Britain.
 This has attracted many to retire to  
 the village and there are now numerous
 homes for the elderly.
