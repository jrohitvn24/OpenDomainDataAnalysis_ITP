		<title>10People of Sedgley</title>
		<content>{People}in{Sedgley}are quite boring    
 sometimes,they don't like fun or      
 having a laugh they only enjoy        
 peaceful places.I don't know many     
 people who are very tall.Sedgley isn't
 as big as someplaces so a lot of{     
{gossip}goes around. Everyone knows    
 each other and everyone's always      
 friendly except some{gangs}of kids. In
 the main parts of Sedgley, in the     
 Bullring there is a lot of noise and  
 that is where most things happens.    
 Sedgley children are doing many       
 activites for{schools}as well. People 
 in{Sedgley}are quite different from   
 other people in other places.
