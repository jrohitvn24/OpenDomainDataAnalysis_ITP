Most  people  in  our  area  travel  by
road.   They use cars, coaches  or ride
bicycles or motor-bicycles.            
Goods  are  moved in  vans and lorries.
The quickest  transport  from  city  to
city in Britain is by train.           
People go from  country  to country  by
sea or air.  Ships take heavy goods and
aeroplanes take lighter parcels.       
People go by air  because it is quicker
for long journeys.                     
People who are very  rich go by private
aeroplanes.                            
The  biggest  airports  in  Britain are
Gatwick and Heathrow.
