		<content>      Our dads work down the mine. They
 work at Clipstone Pit and Mansfield   
 Colliery. Our dads go on three shifts,
 they are days, nights and afters.     
 Sometimes our dads go in the car or go
 on the bus to the pit. They are off on
 Saturdays and Sundays and they get    
 their wages on Friday.                
      Many people work at the pit.     
 There are about 1,000 people. They go 
 down about 2,150 feet under ground.   
 They go down in a chair which takes   
 about 65 people. When they are down   
 there are different routes to go. They
 use all sorts of tools. There are     
 sometimes diggers, explosives and     
 machines. When there is a gas leak my 
 dad goes down the tunnel to see where 
 the gas is coming from.               
      The coal that they dig up goes to
 the power station to make electricity.
