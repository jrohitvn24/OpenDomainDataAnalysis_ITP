		<title>02Trade: Market Day</title>
		<content> Tuesday in Penrith is 'Market Day'.   
 The day begins early, as the stalls   
 are set up at eight o'clock in the    
 part of town called Great Dockray.    
 The open market has been on the same  
 site for over forty years, but has    
 been on many Different sites through  
 history.  Great Dockray is a public   
 car park during the rest of the week, 
 but on Tuesday it is a bustling, noisy
 area of activity. The open stalls are 
 many and varied, from plants to potato
 peelers, flowers to fish, clothes to  
 cantaloups.  Many traders travel over 
 a hundred miles to set up their       
 stalls, and have been comming week    
 after week, year after year, summer   
 and winter.  The open market is busy  
 during the winter months, and it takes
 very bad weather for the stall holders
 not to turn up.  In the summer the    
 regular customes are joined by tourist</content>
