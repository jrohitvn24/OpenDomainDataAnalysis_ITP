		<title>08Transport in Bognor Regis</title>
		<content>  In 1864 a { Railway Station }was     
 built in Bognor Regis.The station is  
 a terminus. Every train that leaves   
 Bognor has to pass through Barnham. On
 the 29th. Sept. 1899 a disaster       
 happened. Some over coats left in     
 front of a stove to dry caught fire   
 and the station was reduced to rubble 
 and had to be rebuilt.                
  {Southdown }is the company that runs 
 Bognor  buses. These are light green. 
 The bus station was closed in 1982    
 because of cost.                      
  From Sept. this year one of the      
 town's main shopping areas will be {  
{pedestrianised}as part of a 12 month  
 experiment. London Rd. will be closed 
 to traffic from 11a.m. until 4.30 p.m.
 on each day of the week.
