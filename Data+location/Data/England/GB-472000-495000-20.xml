		<title>20AN ORDINARY DAY.</title>
		<content> I get up at 7.00am and get breakfast, 
 feed the dog whilst Vicki sees to the 
 2 horses. I walk to school by 8.15am  
 and prepare for the day's lessons,open
 the post and talk with the children as
 they start arriving about 8.30am.     
 After school finishes, I stay until   
 about 5.30pm marking books,displaying 
 work and writing letters. On getting  
 home I usually find that Vicki is out 
 riding so I have my tea, read the     
 paper and perhaps write a letter to my
 husband, who is away at sea, or my    
 eldest daughter who is at University. 
 The evening is either spent at a      
 meeting(PTA.,Governors,Headteachers or
 Pony Club) or I watch the television. 
 The travelling Library  calls once a  
 fortnight. A butcher calls every week 
 and sometimes a Fishman. We have oil  
 central heating and electricity for   
 cooking and lighting.                 </content>
