  Much of the mill machinery is still  
 there.                                
 In the 1920's the mill no longer      
 relied on wind power but was converted
 to steam.                             
 In 1926 the mill was struck by        
 lightning.It struck the sails and ran 
 down a beam and set fire to the       
 chaff.Some quick thinking by some     
 locals meant the mill was saved from  
 being burnt down.                     
 The sails were badly damaged by a     
 summer storm in 1965 and were never   
 replaced.
