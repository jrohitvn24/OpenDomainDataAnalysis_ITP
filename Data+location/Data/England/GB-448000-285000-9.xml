		<content> At the village hall a{playgroup}is    
 held on Monday,Wednesday and Thursday 
 mornings between 9:00 am and 12:00 pm.
    Preschool children make and play   
 games.They play with "playdoh" and    
 plasticine and they stick boxes and   
 paint pictures.Then they  sit down on 
 benches or chairs and have a bottle of
 milk and a biscuit each.Each summer   
 the play school goes on a day trip to 
 a park.                               
    There is also a{"Mums and toddlers"
 group which copes with younger        
 children,but their mums(or dads) stay 
 with them to help them play,and they  
 are there to comfort them if they     
 begin to cry.
