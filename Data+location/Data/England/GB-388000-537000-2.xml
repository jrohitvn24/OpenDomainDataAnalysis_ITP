		<title>02FARMING : A WEARDALE FARM(1)</title>
		<content>    We have 2 farms which we run       
 together. Weeds farm is at Westgate   
 and Clough House farm is at Killhope. 
 They are 8 miles apart. {Both are     
{sheep and cattle farms and neither    
{have ploughed land.                   
                                       
                                       
    Weeds has better pastures and      
 meadows than Killhope because the     
 climate is warmer. At Killhope there  
 is more meadow and pasture land but it
 is mainly moor. The land at Killhope  
 is used mainly for sheep.             
                                       
                                       
    There are 520 sheep in the flock.  
 They are Swaledale, Suffolk and Blue  
 faced Leicesters. At Weeds the        
 Leicester ram is crossed with a       
 Swaledale ewe to breed a Mule lamb.
