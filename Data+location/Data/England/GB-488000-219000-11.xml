		<content> With the death of Lord Rosebery and   
 the subsequent sale of the estate, the
{Stud Farm}was purchased merely as a   
 home and not as a going concern. There
 is no longer a stud farm here, nor    
 indeed are there any horses, just a   
 few cattle. The Land is let for       
 grazing.{The Thatched Barns,}formerly 
 used as fodder storage, are now       
 converted into houses and are being   
 sold on the open market. They are     
 still thatched and timbered in        
 construction, but their continued     
 existance will be far removed from    
 past uses. The village will gain more 
 residents, but many of them will be   
 commuters and not involved with the   
 land or local industry. However there 
 are still some farm workers resident  
 in Crafton.{Crafton Lodge }is the     
 former gamekeeper's cottage and this  
 year has become a listed building.    </content>
