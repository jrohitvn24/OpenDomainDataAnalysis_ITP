       Moving into a cafe.             
        By Gavin Liddel.               
                                       
       Moving into a cafe is very hard 
 work. We have lived in Delabole for   
 three weeks. It is a bit better       
 scenery than in Newbury. Newbury is   
 the town where I used to live.        
        I do a lot of jobs like cut    
 paper for the take-away. My dad's old 
 job was lorry driving. He drove to    
 France about twice a week. But now he 
 is a cook. The cafe is called the     
 Quarry cafe. It has six tables and a  
 take-away.
