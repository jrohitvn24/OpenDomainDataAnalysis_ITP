		<content> By now we were beginning to feel      
 rather weary as we had been walking   
 for some considerable time. We decided
 to turn for home.Fortunately we did   
 not have to retrace our steps, but    
 could go back by a more direct route. 
 This took us close to a number of     
 factories which have developed on this
 part of the heath. One of them is     
 quite large, the export division of   
 Max Factor. Another, with quite an    
 imposing front, makes components for  
 the aircraft industry. We were now    
 nearing the end of our journey as     
 familiar landmarks came into sight.   
 What an enjoyable day we had had and  
 how pleased we would be to see mum and
 have a nice cup of tea.
