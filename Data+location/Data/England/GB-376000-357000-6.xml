		<content> Children at school play traditional   
 games of football, rounders, cricket  
 and tennis. There are also other games
 played mainly by girls.{Polo.}1 person
 is 'on' and choses a subject. The     
 others think of different aspects of  
 the subject which are then shouted    
 out. The person who is 'on' picks one 
 of the aspects of the subject and     
 whoever chose it has to race to the   
 wall and back and shout 'Polo' before 
 the other person does. If they fail to
 do so they are out of the game.{Peggy 
{leggy.}This is a variation of 'Polo'. 
 Instead of racing against each other, 
 they fold their arms and stand on one 
 leg and try to make the other person  
 put their leg down.{Chain tic. }Played
 by 5 boys or more. 1 Person is on.    
 When they catch another person and    
 hold hands and so on. When everyone is
 caught the game begins again.         </content>
