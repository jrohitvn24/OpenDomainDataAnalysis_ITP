		<content> Sutton is situated on the East coast  
 of Britain by the North Sea.The sea is
 important because it attracts holiday 
 makers who bring trade.Because of     
 the visitors who come to the sea we   
 have more shops than other villages   
 our size. We get floods in winter     
 which we get used to.{Lifeboats:}it is
 always dangerous for a small boat to  
 go to sea but for large ships the     
 worst time is from October to         
 November.We get about 4 ships sunk    
 yearly off this coast and around 1500 
 in difficulty.When a ship has problems
 and the lifeboat cannot get next to it
 they fire a rocket over the ship and  
 the crew on the wreck fasten the rope 
 to a mast.Then two more ropes are sent
 one with a lifebuoy and the crew are  
 winched over to the lifeboat.{
