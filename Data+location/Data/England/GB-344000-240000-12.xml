		<title>12Farming, Garden Centres</title>
		<content> In this block is a large enterprise,  
 Wyevale Nurseries Ltd, which now runs 
 10 Garden Centres in England and      
 Wales. The original nursery dating    
 from 1930 was developed as a garden   
 centre after 1963. Roses, hardy       
 herbaceous plants and fruit trees     
 especially apples are grown here.     
 Other nurseries in the group produce  
 alpines, shrubs and trees. Many       
 specimen trees are grown for amenity  
 and landscape planting. Most plants   
 are sold in containers for instant    
 planting; this trend has encouraged   
 the rapid growth of interest in       
 gardening as a leisure activity. These
 garden centres sell all kinds of      
 plants, including pot plants for the  
 home, and also a wide range of seeds, 
 bulbs and garden sundries such as     
 tools and fertilisers.
