		<content>    Housing in Bar Hill is cheaper than
 the rest of the area and much cheaper 
 than Cambridge itself so some people  
 use it as a stepping stone to more    
 expensive housing elsewhere.There is  
 also a high proportion of young and   
 ambitious professionals in the village
 who tend to stay two or three years   
 and then move on.We hope that once the
 building stops,which it will do       
 soon,the flow of people leaving the   
 village will be balanced by those     
 moving in.                            
    We found that 64% of our sample    
 moved to the village in the first     
 place because the housing is the      
 cheapest in the area,but still very   
 convenient for Cambridge.Even though  
 so many people were forced to live    
 here because of the high price of     
 housing in our area,87% of our sample 
 are very happy living in Bar Hill.    </content>
