		<title>01THE MINSTERWORTH AREA</title>
		<content>  The village of Minsterworth lies on  
 the north bank of the River Severn    
 some two miles west of Gloucester. The
 River is the main geographical feature
 of our block. Most of the land, which 
 is flat and low lying, is used for    
 farming, especially for cattle. The   
 land near the River, like Minsterworth
 Ham, is liable to be flooded in       
 winter. The main A48 Gloucester -     
 Chepstow road crosses the block from  
 north-east to south-west, as does the 
 Midlands-South Wales Railway. The A40 
 Gloucester-Ross on Wye road crosses   
 the northern edge of the block. Most  
 of the houses are in the village of   
 Minsterworth which lies along the A48,
 but there is also a small village at  
 Churcham and houses at Elmore Back on 
 the south bank of the R.Severn. There 
 is a wood at Clay Hill; many of the   
 houses have cider apple orchards.     </content>
