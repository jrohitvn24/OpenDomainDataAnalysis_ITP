		<title>15WATER SUPPLY:SCAMMONDEN DAM.</title>
		<content> Huddersfield has benefited from an    
 organized water supply since 1743.    
 From 1868 to 1897 a massive programme 
 of municipal reservoir building took  
 place,yet by 1960 it was clear that   
 more supplies were needed.            
 The remote Scammonden Valley was      
 flooded and the Dam was completed in  
 1971.In a unique cooperative venture  
 between motorway engineers and the    
 Huddersfield Water Authority,the dam  
 was designed to carry the M62 motorway
 across the valley on the crest of its 
 embankment for 615 metres.This under- 
 taking needed a Private Members Bill  
 through Parliament.The construction   
 took over three years.Even appalling  
 weather conditions failed to halt its 
 progress.The reservoir can hold 1700  
 million gallons and has a surface area
 of 104 acres.It supplies 6 million    
 gallons daily; half the area's needs. </content>
