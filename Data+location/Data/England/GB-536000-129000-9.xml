		<title>09Highbrook - Customs</title>
		<content> There are no longstanding traditions  
 in this area of dispersed population  
 but some have been introduced in      
 Highbrook as a deliberate ploy on the 
 part of the Clarke family to foster a 
 community spirit. At the begining of  
 the year, the traditional season for  
 Mummers Plays, a group of local people
 go to houses in the village and       
 perform a play which depicts the fight
 between good and evil in a comic form.
 One member of the cast first performed
 in these plays 40 years ago. During   
 the summer a Flower Festival is held  
 and in the Autumn, Harvest Supper is  
 given in the Village Hall.There is a  
 November 5th bonfire preceded by a    
 torchlight procession to which        
 virtually all Highbrook residents go. 
 At the end of the year there is a     
 Carol Service and the Bell Ringers are
 much in demand.                       </content>
