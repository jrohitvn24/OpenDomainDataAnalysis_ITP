		<content>   Most of the area is covered by      
{farmland.}Very few people live there. 
 The nearest town is Ryde.             
   There are no major{roads}and the    
 railway line is closed although most  
 of the route is still visible.        
   The island is a tourist centre and  
 the Council has just completed a new  
{trail}called the Downs Way which      
 passes through the area.              
   There is some woodland and in the   
 South are the downs from which there  
 are magnificent views of the Arreton  
 valley further South.                 
   There are two{streams}draining the  
 area. Both run Northwards.One joins   
 the sea at Wootton and the other at   
 Ryde.                                 
  {Nunwell House,}until recently the   
 home of the Oglander family,is        
 the largest building in the area.
