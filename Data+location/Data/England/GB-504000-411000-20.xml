		<title>20FOOTPATHS -THE VIKING WAY</title>
		<content> There are many footpaths within the   
 area.They form a network connecting   
 farms and woodland.The longest one    
 crossing the area is the Viking Way,  
 which extends from the Humber Bridge  
 to Oakham in Leicestershire. This path
 has been evolved by linking together  
 existing public rights of way. In     
 places it follows roads before again  
 becoming a walk within the Countryside
 The path is marked with a Viking      
 Helmet symbol which has been put on   
 posts, stiles and gates along the way.
 A bridleway has opened from Croxton   
 and this joins with the Viking Way    
 on Race lane.An underpass has been    
 built under the new A180 to allow     
 this Bridleway to continue,and allow  
 farmers access to their fields.
