		<title>20Mitcham Windmill</title>
		<content> John Barker was given land on Mitcham 
 Common to build a flour mill in{1806  
 In the{1860's}lightning struck and two
 of the sails were knocked off. It was 
 not used again. In{1905}the main body 
 of the mill was demolished. {THE MILL 
{IN 1985} We visited the remains of the
 mill. It is in Windmill Rd. near      
 Windmill House behind an old biscuit  
 factory but people don't work there   
 any more.All the machinery and the    
 sails are missing. Only the wall at   
 the bottom and three wooden legs on   
 top of it are left. Grass is growing  
 out of the wall.                      
 It was called a post mill because it  
 had a big post in the middle going up 
 to the top. Part of the post is still 
 there.This was used to turn the sails 
 into the wind. We got out our sketch  
 pads to draw the ruins and imagined   
 when the wind blew the sails round.   </content>
