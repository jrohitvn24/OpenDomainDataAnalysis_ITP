		<content> Some children today are very fortunate
 in having enlightened and deeply      
 caring and considerate parents.Some   
 children return to empty homes with   
 scant provision for their needs.These 
 are called 'latch-key kids'.As parents
 try to cope with the pressures of life
 their children are sometimes at       
 risk.Locally some children are badly  
 abused.                               
   The increased wealth in some        
 homes,due to second incomes,has meant 
 that children often have very         
 expensive possessions.Some have       
 portable television sets,home         
 computers,cassette-radios,electronic  
 games and plenty of money to spend.   
   In other homes children do not get  
 enough to eat,and may not even have a 
 bed to sleep in.In Calcot the extremes
 between those who have,and those who  
 do not,are becoming more obvious.     </content>
