 As a shared facility the local        
 community has access to the complex

 was opened in l978 and offers a number
 of sporting facilities not available  
 previously.  There is a swimming pool 
 (25m) used for competitive and leisure
 swimming with a recent addition of    
 large inflatable toys for childrens   
 water play.  There is now a thriving  
 club which caters for the competitive 
 swimmber and arranges classes for the 
 disabled.                             
 Included in the complex are four      
 squash courts.  This is very popular  
 with an active league in the area.    
                                       
 There is a Youth Club which is part of
 the centre, and they use the pool for 
 canoeing, life saving, underwater     
 swimming, and canoe-polo.             </content>
