		<title>10SHOPPING STREETS IN HERNEBAY</title>
		<content> Herne Bay's main shopping areas of    
 Mortimer Street and the High Street   
 are both included in this block. These
 streets still include some of the     
 small family businesses which have    
 tended to find it harder to compete in
 recent years. The shoe shop in William
 Street has boxes of shoes piled high  
 and other wares hanging from the      
 ceiling of the dark interior. A small 
 sweet shop in the same street with    
 shelves of glass jars and shining     
 copper scales has just closed to make 
 room for one of a chain of photo      
 processing shops. Many of the small   
 shops find it difficult to compete    
 with the prices charged by the large  
 superstores and many shoppers find it 
 convenient to do all their shopping   
 under one roof.                       
                                       
                                       </content>
