		<title>08THE RIVERSIDE MUSEUM:TILBURY</title>
		<content> The Museum was opened in 1977. Usually
 there is only one person in charge.   
 The workers are employed by the local 
 council. The oldest thing on display  
 is some{Tudor glass}found near the    
 River Thames.                         
                                       
 The most valuable exhibits are the    
 models of the ships. Inside the museum
 they have the bell of{HMS ESSEX}that  
 was donated by the Navy. All the      
 exhibits  are connected with the river
 in some way. The articles in the      
 museum are either given, bought or    
 found. The lady at the museum enjoys  
 her work.
