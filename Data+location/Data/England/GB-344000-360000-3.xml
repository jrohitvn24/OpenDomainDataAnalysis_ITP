		<title>03The Grosvenors in Cheshire.</title>
		<content> Nearly all of the land &amp; buildings    
 (including Saighton village) west of  
 the "A"41(T) road &amp; north of Platts   
 Lane are owned by the 6th Duke of     
 Westminster.The farmland is managed   
 for him as part of the "Grosvenor     
 Estates",as one entity &amp; run by a     
 farm manager. Some of the{farmhouses  
 on the Estate are tenanted by its     
 employees but they have no control    
 over the land about their homes.      
 Other farmhouses are rented out eg.   
 Hattonheath Farmhouse to a builder's  
 family; Hatton Lodge &amp; Elmtree        
 farmhouse to students from Chester law
 college.Non-farm houses are also      
 tenanted by employees or are rented to
 eg.a tree surgeon.Under the Duke's    
 patronage a slightly feudal society   
 seems to exist with people being      
 somewhat reticent &amp; they either accept
 what the Estate does or leave!        </content>
