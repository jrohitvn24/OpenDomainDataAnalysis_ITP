 The Pocklington Canal Amenities       
 Society, has been co-ordinating the   
 Canal's restoration since 1969. The   
 Canal covers 9 miles, from the        
 York/Hull road, to the River Derwent  
 at East Cottingwith, and will soon be 
 open to navigation by barges for 5    
 miles as far as Melbourne. The        
 swing-bridges are to be erected by the
 Society, on foundations which will be 
 built  by The British Waterways Board.
 Two fixed bridges are to be dismantled
 The remaining 4 mile stretch, which   
 includes 7 of the Canal's 9 locks is  
 at present used only be pleasure      
 boats. The British Waterways Board are
 dredging the canal basin at Canal Head
 The old lock/keeper's house is a cafe,
 and the approach road has been planted
 on each side with Silver Birch.In l823
