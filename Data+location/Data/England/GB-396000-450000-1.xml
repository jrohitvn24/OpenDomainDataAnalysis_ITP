		<content>  Skipton is situated about 15 km North
 West of Keighley in the Aire Valley.  
 Its site marks the North-Western      
 boundary of Industrial West Yorkshire 
 &amp; the Southern boundary of the        
 Yorkshire Dales, characterised by     
 up-faulted carboniferous limestone.   
 Peat &amp; grit stone moors overlooking   
 old industrial valleys, being more    
 typical downstream.The canal &amp; railway
 stimulated growth in limestone        
 quarrying &amp; textiles.Some new light   
 industries along main roads.New       
 by-pass helped relieve traffic        
 congestion since 1983.                
     The town probably best known as a 
 tourist town acting as the gateway to 
 the Dales.                            
     Employment is generally better    
 than average but tending towards      
 market or seasonal occupations. All   
 the textile Mills are now closed.     </content>
