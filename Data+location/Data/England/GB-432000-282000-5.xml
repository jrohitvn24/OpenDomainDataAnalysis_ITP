		<content>{Group from John Shelton,Little Heath  
{and Whitmore Park Junior School.}     
 We went to visit{Exhall Grange        
{Special School.}It is for{handicapped 
{children}who can't see or hear,or who 
 might have other difficulties.Children
 come from all over the place.Some     
 children showed us round the school.It
 is 32 years old,and has 350 children  
 from 4_19 years of age.There are 40_50
 teachers,some of them sleep at the    
 school.Each class has about 15        
 children.At the moment they are       
 building a ramp in case there is a    
 fire and so that people in wheelchairs
 can get out quickly.There are 6 houses
 _4 boys and 2 girls.Some of the       
 children go home at weekends.We went  
 to the Braille classroom.They had     
 Braille maps and books and a          
 typewriter.A Braille machine plugs    
 into a computer with a voice machine. </content>
