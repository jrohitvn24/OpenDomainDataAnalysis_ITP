<title>31Farming in Ravensthorpe</title>
<content>

Farming in 2011 is very different from 25 years ago. The only farmers are Trevor and Pat Foss at Hawtoft Farm in the village with one other lodge farm. Casual labour and contractors are employed by both at peak times.  &lt;br />&lt;br />Hawtoft is a 230 acre mixed farm with 170 ewes, 20 cattle, 97 acres of crops such as wheat and oats. In addition we have 25 acres of Miscanthus grass grown for bio-fuel. The farm has a small livery yard, has diversified into selling Christmas trees and lets out a 1000sq ft factory unit. Machinery comprises of two 100hp John Deere tractors a combine and a full range of cultivating equipment. &lt;br />&lt;br />The cereal crops are all taken to a store at Long Buckby where drying and cleaning if needed is carried out. Wheat has reached £200 a tonne, lambs up to £100 and finished cattle regularly make £1000, farmland values vary but average around £5000. To make a lasting legacy on the landscape which contributes to wildlife, a native woodland has been planted of one third oak, one third ash and the rest are mixed species.&lt;br />&lt;br />   &lt;br />
