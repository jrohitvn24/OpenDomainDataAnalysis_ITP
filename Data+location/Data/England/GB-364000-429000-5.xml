		<content> St.Mary'S CE Mellor is a Royal parish 
 with its church in the centre of the  
 village. The task of repairing the    
 roof after an attack of dry and wet   
 rot is completed and the roof repair  
 fund has almost reached its target of 
 Â£65 000 . The church has close links  
 with the school. The vicar is the     
 Chairman of the Board of Govenors and 
 takes the school assembly every Friday
 morning. The building of the second   
 phase of St Mary's CE School will     
 begin in September, also a new        
 vicarage is planned nearby.{St Mary's 
{RC}has also been repairing their      
 church roof; and the High Altar has   
 been reduced in size and brought      
 forward so that the priest can        
 celebrate mass facing the people. Most
 of the parish live in Mellor; so St   
 George's was built in 1969 to provide 
 a parish hall.                        </content>
