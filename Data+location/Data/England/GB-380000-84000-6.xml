		<content> Mr.Rothwell,the land agent,for the    
 Weld Estates came to school to tell us
 about the land South of the A352 road 
 that is owned by the Weld Family.Mr.  
 Rothwell brought his 'Terriers'with   
 him.These are not dogs but big,thick  
 books that contain lists of all the   
 lands that are owned by the Weld      
 Estates.The word'Terrier' comes from  
 the Latin word 'Terra' meaning land.  
 They have 121.37 acres of woodland.In 
 1957 Coombe Wood and North Wood were  
 leased to the Forestry Commission for 
 200 years.They grow Larch and Douglas 
 Fir.When the trees are mature and cut 
 they will probably go for paper pulp. 
 The trees have to be protected;by wire
 netting;from rabbits and hares.If the 
 trees are nibbled when they are small 
 they grow two leaders or trunks which 
 means they are not so strong or       
 useful.                               </content>
