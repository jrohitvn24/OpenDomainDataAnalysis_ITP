		<title>13A School Day</title>
		<content> We start school at 8.55am.When we get 
 into the class we read while Miss     
 Wait (our teacher) does the register. 
 When she has done the register we go  
 to assembly.In the assembly we have a 
 story read by the Headmaster.After    
 assembly we go back to the class.In   
 class we do some written work or      
 maths.At 10.30am we have 15 minutes   
 break.When we go back into class we   
 normally do a different subject.At    
 dinner time we have school dinners or 
 packed lunch.After dinner we have     
 half an hour break.At 1.15pm we all go
 in.In class some of us do art,but     
 often different children are doing    
 different work in the class at the    
 same time. At 2.20pm we have another  
 15 minutes break.After break we       
 sometimes do sports.At 3.30 we go     
 home.Some people stay behind after    
 school to do sports.                  </content>
