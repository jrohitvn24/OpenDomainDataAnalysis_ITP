		<title>07EARLY DAYS AT ROSSINGTON PIT</title>
		<content>     Joseph Turner started work in     
 1917, aged 14, as a haulage hand. It  
 was hard work, accidents were common  
 but medical aid unheard of. Miners had
 to travel to the coalface in their own
 time carrying lamps, with food (snap) 
 and drink tins (dudleys) strapped to  
 their belts.                          
     Wearing boots,shorts and vests    
 they worked waist deep in slurry using
 picks and shovels. With no pithead    
 baths the men had to walk home filthy 
 to wash.  During the General Strike   
 (1926) there was no strike pay and    
 Joseph, newly married, had to sell    
 possessions in order to live.         
     Accidents and illness were feared 
 as they could result in both loss of  
 job and also the pit house that went  
 with it. Joseph died from the miners' 
 disease pneumoconiosis aged only 56.
