		<title>19Transport in Pennington</title>
		<content>  In our village of Pennington there is
 a danger to safety.It is the main     
 road. The main road is the A590 which 
 stretches fron Barrow to Ulverston and
 leads to the A6.Although we could not 
 do without the A590,people do not like
 it because of speeding vehicles and   
 pollution from  the fumes.Some people 
 say that it cuts the village in two   
 because sometimes you have to wait for
 about five minutes before you can     
 cross the road.We need a by-pass or a 
 subway.We are very lucky because we   
 have a lolly pop lady.When we went to 
 the A590 to do a traffic survey,we    
 noticed that the vehicles,especially  
 cars and heavy lorries,seemed to be   
 going very fast.
