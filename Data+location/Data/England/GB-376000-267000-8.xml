		<content>   RALPH de TODENI, one of WILLIAM     
 THE CONQUEROR'S noblemen, founded a { 
{PRIORY}at Astley attached to a French 
 Abbey. The Priory was situated at the 
 East end of the church. If you walk   
 down the eastern side of the          
 churchyard, water may be seen         
 trickling from beneath the original   
 stone arch of the{PRIOR'S WELL.   }   
   Immediately south of the church is  
 an overgrown hillside sloping down to 
 Dick Brook. Known locally as{THE      
{VINEYARD}it may well have been used as
 such by the men at the Priory.        
   The bridge known as {NEW BRIDGE,}   
 which connects the church and         
 Glasshampton, has recently been       
 designated a{PACK BRIDGE,}and talks   
 are going on between the two owners of
 the land on either side of Dick Brook 
 about its future upkeep.
