		<content> In Lockington there is a{Street Fair} 
 every year.The money raised is for the
 church.The choir each have jobs such  
 as selling posies,balloons or helping 
 with games.The stallholders dress up  
 in{Victorian}clothes.At the beginning 
 there is a fancy dress competition    
 judged by the person who opens the    
 fair.There is a wheelbarrow race      
 through the ford and a slippery       
 pole.There is a great variety of other
 stalls and cream teas are available in
 the village hall.Children from the    
 school take part in dancing displays  
 and they also design the cover for the
 programme.The main street is closed   
 off to traffic and people come from   
 miles around to enjoy the fun.
