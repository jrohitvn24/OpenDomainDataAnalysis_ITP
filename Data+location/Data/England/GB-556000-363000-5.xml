{The fire-station}is on{Burgh Road}but 
 this has not always been so.During    
 the war there were three fire-stations
 in Skegness.One was on Wainfleet Road,
 one at the Vine Hotel and the main one
 on Roman Bank.The firestation on Burgh
 Road was opened by Councillor F.T     
 Hepworth on the 8th May 1973.The      
 Skegness Fire Brigade was started in  
 1725  about 200 years ago.When it     
 first started the fire engines were   
 hand carts with buckets of water.In   
 1910 the horse drawn carts came in.   
 Modern day fire engines cost fifty    
 thousand pounds.Skegness comes under B
 division.The longest running fire     
 lasted one week.To be a fireman you   
 have to be at least five foot seven   
 and  they have to pass certain tests. 
 The Hydraulic Platform can reach up to
 sixty five feet.                      </content>
