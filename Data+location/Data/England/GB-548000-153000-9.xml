		<title>09Bat and Ball Railway Station</title>
		<content>Bat and Ball Station is at the bottom  
of St. Johns Hill Sevenoaks. On the 3rd
of July we went there on an outing.    
When we got to the station we saw a    
sign saying closed on Sundays. Then we 
went through a gate to look for the    
guard but we couldn't find him. We went
there again and this time he was there.
He showed us an overgrown turn table   
used many years ago. The station was   
built in 1865 approximately. It had a  
goods yard and trains used to stop     
there to be refilled with water. On the
front of the station there was a ring  
to tie a pony and cart up with. Across 
the road from the station there are    
houses where the people who worked at  
the station used to live. Now they are 
 council houses. On a weekday the      
 station is closed from 11.00 until    
 15.00. It has a very big waiting room 
 and free parking.                     </content>
