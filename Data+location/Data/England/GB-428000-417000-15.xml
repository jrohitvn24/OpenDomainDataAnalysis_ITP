		<content> People in Horbury take part in many   
 sports.My favourite one is            
 football.I play at school and also for
 the under-13 team in the village of   
 Netherton,south of Horbury.There are  
 lots of pub teams and leagues in      
 Horbury for football,cricket,darts and
 dominoes.                             
 BROWNIES:I attend meetings of the     
 Brownies group at Northfield Lane     
 School from 6.15 to 7.30pm on         
 Mondays.Brownies are all girls and we 
 wear a brown uniform with a yellow    
 necktie.Each person has a badge to    
 show which one of the six patrols they
 belong to.We pay 20p a week           
 subscription.                         
 CHURCH: I go to Sunday School at St.  
 Mary's church.We sing songs and say   
 prayers before we go to our           
 classes.Our school lollipop lady Mrs  
 Davies,is one of our teachers.        </content>
