		<title>16ETON PORNY SCHOOL</title>
		<content>  Some people think that Porny is an   
 odd name for a school .Our school was 
 founded with a bequest from Richard   
 Porny who was a Master at Eton        
 college.We talked to some old people  
 who remembered coming to the school.  
 The school used to be divided into    
 two,girls upstairs and boys downstairs
 There used to be a fence down the     
 middle of the playground.There lessons
 were mainly maths and English and some
 Nature Study. The boys did woodwork   
 and the girls did needlework.They     
 didn't have television and there was a
 fire-engine where our television room 
 is now.They stayed here until they    
 were 14 and didn't go to another      
 school.                               
  In 1987 our Middle School is going to
 close and Eton Porny will probably be 
 a Lower School only for children from 
 5-9 years.                            </content>
