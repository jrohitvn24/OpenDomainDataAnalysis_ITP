		<title>15A WINTER WALK IN BERGHOLT</title>
		<content>     I WALKED DOWN CHITTS HILL IN THE  
 POURING RAIN AND WIND,I WAS ON MY WAY 
 TO SCHOOL.TRICKLING DOWN THE SIDES OF 
 THE ROAD IS A LITTLE STREAM;I TURN    
 ROUND AND LOOK UP THE HILL TO SEE     
 WHERE IT'S COMING FROM.THE SKY IS DARK
 GREY AND THE TREES ARE BENDING AND    
 CREAKING AS IF THEY ARE GOING TO FALL 
 DOWN.WHEN I GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THE  
 HILL I STOP AND WATCH THE RIVER       
 FLOW;IT HAS A STRONG CURRENT AND THE  
 SWIRLING OF THE WATER MAKES IT MISTY.I
 PICK UP A STICK AND THROW IT.IT LANDS 
 A LITTLE WAY UP THE RIVER, THEN GETS  
 CAUGHT IN THE CURRENT AND CARRIED     
 ALONG.I WATCH THE COWS SEEK SHELTER   
 UNDER THE TREES AND NIBBLE THE        
 HEDGES.I START TO WALK UP THE HILL    
 WHEN I'M STOPPED BY A PERSON TO ASK ME
 THE WAY TO A FARM;I TELL HIM AND WALK 
 ON.THE ROAD IS MUDDY AND EVERYTHING IS
 WET.THE PHONE BOX LOOKS LIKE IT'S NEW.</content>
