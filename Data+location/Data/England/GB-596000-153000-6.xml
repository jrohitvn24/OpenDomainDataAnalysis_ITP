		<content> Throwley is on the North Downs. The   
 height varies from 80 metres in the   
 North to 140 metres in the South. This
 means stronger winds, more rain and   
 cooler temperatures than lower down.  
   There are three kinds of soil. On   
 the Down tops it is clay with flints, 
 on the valley sides it is chalky, and 
 in the valley bottoms there is good   
 silty soil. There is no grade 1       
 land,40% of grade 2, 35% of grade 3,  
 and 5% of grade 4. The remaining 20%  
 is woodland.                          
   The problems of the area include the
 steep slopes of the valleys, the hard 
 flints that can damage machinery, and 
 animal pests such as rabbits and      
 pigeons.                              
   In recent years much of the         
 grassland has been ploughed for cerial
 and rape crops, because of the good   
 economic return.                      </content>
