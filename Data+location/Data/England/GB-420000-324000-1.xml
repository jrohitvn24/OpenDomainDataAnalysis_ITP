		<content>A great part of the area is farmland,  
with a mixture of arable and dairy     
farms and 1 Summer fruit farm.There is 
only one village with a small          
population and few facilities.The      
populated area is a mixture of old and 
new houses.Some of the houses were     
built around 1850 and there is some    
house building being carried out now.  
The area includes a hospital centre and
a staff club and a large sports and    
social club owned by one of the 4 main 
brewery companies in Burton-on-Trent . 
There are 5 schools including the small
village school of Anslow.There are     
several small shops in the area but    
there is no main shopping or meeting   
place.
