		<content>  Mrs. Savage, my Nan, has lived in    
 Frodsham all her life and since       
 retiring has devoted much time to     
 painting china in her kitchen.She     
 painted plates for her children,      
 grandchildren and gradually got orders
 from others. Why paint local scenes?  
 People asked for scenes of where they 
 used to live, the church they were    
 married in or views of their road long
 ago. Her plates are exported all over 
 the world.Work is displayed in the    
 Crest Hotel Runcorn, at craft fayres  
 and she talks to many organisations.  
 She has connections with the Lewis    
 Carroll society, visitors to Daresbury
 often buying her "Alice" mementos.    
 Unpainted plates are bought from Stoke
 on Trent or Germany.Special china     
 powder paints are used, mixed to a    
 fine paste and finally fired in her   
 own kiln, most needing three firings. </content>
