		<title>02WATER TREATMENT PLANT</title>
		<content>   The pumping and treatment plant,    
built in 1898, on the outskirts of     
Goudhurst supplies water to Benenden,  
Cranbrook, part of Kilndown, Marden,   
Rolvenden and Staplehurst.             
   Originally water came from 4 bore   
holes, 25 metres deep. 6 more bore     
holes 100 metres deep were bored in    
1950 and 2 more in 1962.               
   The plant is manned for 24 hours    
a day in shifts, so alarm signals      
from more modern pumping stations      
are monitored here.                    
    Water comes up the bore holes over 
aeration towers to get rid of iron.    
Lime takes out other oxides. A gravity 
filter takes out particles to a        
settling tank, the sludge being dumped 
in the old railway cutting. Chlorine,  
to kill bacteria is removed with       
sulphur dioxide. It is then filtered   
and pumped to our taps.                </content>
