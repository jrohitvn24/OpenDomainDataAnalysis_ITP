		<title>05Wootton Church</title>
		<content> St.Mary's church is early 14th        
 century,although there was a former   
 church on the site.The church of      
 Wootton was bestowed on Newnham Priory
 by Simon de Beauchamp in his          
 foundation charter of 1166.The oldest 
 parts of the church are arches which  
 date from 1310.The church was said to 
 have been situated in a wood,but now  
 there are only one or two trees around
 it.To the north of the church is a    
 coffin lid with a beautifully carved  
 14th century cross.The south porch is 
 a later addition.The upper part of    
 the tower is early 15th century       
 work,as is the tracery inserted in    
 several windows.The lower part of the 
 tower has been largely rebuilt.The    
 north and south walls of the chancel  
 have been refaced.The tiled roof is   
 modern.The nave and aisles have       
 embattled parapets.                   </content>
