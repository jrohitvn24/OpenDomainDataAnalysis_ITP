		<content>  Mr.Percy Barnwell of{Dunchurch}aged  
 82 on 7th June 1985 gave us some      
 information about{Dunchurch}when he   
 was a boy.                            
  Before the 1st World War{Dunchurch}  
 was a peaceful,friendly village,but   
 after the 1st World War more crime was
 committed and because of this a jail  
 was built,later to be knocked down.   
  During the 2nd World War,one bomb and
 a large land mine caused damage in the
 area and at least one man was killed. 
{ Dunchurch}had three stables,two of   
 which hired out horses and one which  
 was private.The stables were behind   
 the Dun Cow Inn and the Green Man Inn.
 The Dun Cow Inn was used as a staging 
 post.                                 
  Before the advent of the railway     
{Dunchurch}was more important than     
 Rugby.The positioning of the stations 
 changed this.                         </content>
