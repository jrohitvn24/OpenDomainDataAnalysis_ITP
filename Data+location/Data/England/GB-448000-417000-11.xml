		<title>11PART OF DARRINGTON-WENTHILLS</title>
		<content>     Only part of Darrington is covered
 by our survey. The centre of the      
 village, including the Church and the 
 School are in the next section.       
     Darrington lies about one and a   
 half miles out of Pontefract. It is   
 about the same distance from the      
 A1/M62 Junction. This part of the     
 village is overshadowed by the        
 flyover.                              
     Most of the housing is modern.    
 There are both bungalows and houses.  
 The housing looks expensive.          
     Darrington Hall is privately      
 owned. It was used as a hospital for  
 ex-servicemen after the 1914-18 War.  
     The Darrington Hotel lies on the  
 sliproad for the A1. It is dependant  
 on the road for its trade.            
     There are two shops in this area, 
 the Farm Shop, and a D-I-Y shop and   
 timber yard.                          </content>
