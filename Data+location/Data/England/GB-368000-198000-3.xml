		<content>  Berkeley is famous as the home of Dr 
 Edward Jenner who discovered          
 vaccination. Jenner was the son of the
 vicar of Berkeley and it was as a     
 result of practising medicine in this 
 area at the end of the 18th           
 century that he noticed that dairy    
 maids on the farms rarely suffered    
 badly from smallpox. It was this that 
 led him to vaccinate a boy called     
 James Phipps with cowpox and then to  
 try, unsuccessfully, to give him      
 smallpox. It took many years for the  
 value of vaccination to be appreciated
 in England.                           
  Nowadays we have the Jenner Museum in
 Berkeley. This is owned by the Jenner 
 Trust who have been able to build a   
 new museum and medical conference     
 centre.
