		<title>13Going for a picnic</title>
		<content>   I like to go to{Pitsford Reservoir} 
 for a picnic with my Mum and Dad and  
 my two sisters, Helen and Anna.We     
 travel in Dad's{Ford Sierra}car from  
 our home in Northampton.There are lots
 of open spaces where you can run about
 and woods where you can hide and play 
 games. We sit on top of a small hill  
 from where you can look down across   
 the reservoir. I like watching the    
 fishermen and the people sailing boats
 while we eat our tea. We take{cheese  
{and pickle}and{chicken}sandwiches,    
 bags of potato{crisps}and some{orange 
{squash}to drink.                      
  Nearby is a black tunnel that carries
 water from one lake to another. When  
 the water level is low, and the tunnel
 is empty, we think it's fun to crawl  
 through on our tummies to the other   
 side. It's only just wide enough for  
 me and my sisters to get through.     </content>
