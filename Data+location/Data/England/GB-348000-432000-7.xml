...house,the countryside and because of
employment.                            
   The changes were the new road,      
{Melbury},{Barrat} and {Delany}        
estates.These were all built as the    
bus routes,the school and the Golf     
Village surrounded  the area.          
   Overall,it was found quite expensive
to live in the area.                   
   The older generation have seen many 
changes. No more than 50 years ago a   
cinder track ran past the house,the    
water was fetched from a farmhouse 50m 
up the track.There was no electricity, 
gas, or telephones.The country area was
liked because it was quiet and fairly  
near to the town.The noise from the    
motorway was unpopular,but as they say 
"{Times have changed.}"
