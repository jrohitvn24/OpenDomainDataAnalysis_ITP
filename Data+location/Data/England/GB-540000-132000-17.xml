		<content> Although much of this area is taken up
 by the{Ashdown Forest}there are many  
 large and expensive properties. Most  
 of the houses are detached and are    
 situated in well landscaped gardens.  
 Those that border the{Royal Ashdown   
{Golf}course or the{Ashdown Forest}are 
 particularly expensive. Nearer the    
 village the semi-detatched, terraced  
 and well-kept Council houses are to be
 found, but these too, tend to be more 
 expensive than something similar in   
 another part of the county.In         
 Michaelfields, there are a collection 
 of very interesting houses built in an
 unusual style reflecting the influence
 of the Anthroposophical movement which
 is so evident in this area. Many of   
 the houses reflect the history of area
 and are built with attractive natural 
 materials.
