		<title>13Holidays on the Canal</title>
		<content>  Every year many people enjoy a       
holiday on the canal. The Shropshire   
Union Canal runs through Gnosall. To   
find out what it is like we asked two  
families.                              
  The first family thoroughly enjoyed  
their holiday and found it just as     
exciting as they thought it would be.  
Although they didn't have all the      
conveniences of home, if they were     
given the chance they would gladly go  
again.                                 
  The second family also enjoyed their 
holiday and found it even better than  
they thought it would be. Although the 
boat was cramped and narrow they still 
found it quiet and peaceful in the     
country. They also missed the          
conveniences of home. They  agreed     
that if they were given the chance     
they would love another holiday as     
they thought it was just great fun.    </content>
