 kilometre block,it's grid reference

 The{River Trent}runs through three of 
 the four most northern squares,running
 close by Amcotts and Neap House.      
 Most of the squares are taken up by   
 fields and farmland. Six of the       
 twelve squares contain some{housing   
 and{industry},but only one contains   
 housing and industry as it's major    
 land cover.                           
 Two of the squares contain{Recreation 
 and{Activity Centres}for people of all
 ages.For example :Community           
 Centres,Clubs and Pubs.
