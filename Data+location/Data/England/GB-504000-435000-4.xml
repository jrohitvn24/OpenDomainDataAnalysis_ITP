		<title>04      WOODMANSEY</title>
		<content>   {Woodmansey}is situated one and a   
 half miles South-East of {Beverley}on 
 the main Hull-Beverley road.  Not     
 surprisingly, there is a road safety  
 problem.  This has been eased since   
 the opening of a bypass.  Woodmansey  
 parish actually includes the hamlet of
 Thearne  and some houses in Beverley  
 -the population totals around 2,200.  
    The main village is built almost   
 entirely on the eastern side of the   
 road and is in two parts,  a ribbon   
 development at the southern end,      
 extending as far as the church        
 (dedicated to St. Peter) and an estate
 at the northern end nearest Beverley.
