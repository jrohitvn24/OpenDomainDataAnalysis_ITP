		<title>10STRATFORD MOTOR MUSEUM.</title>
		<content> The{Motor Museum}is fairly small.The  
 exhibition is called{The Golden Age Of
{Motoring.}Most of the cars were built 
 between 1910 &amp; 1940.It has several    
{Rolls Royces,}one made in 1926.Some of
 the cars have starting handles,       
 several have wooden spokes, all had   
 mud guards.One Rolls Royce was owned  
 by the Prime Minister of Hyderbad     
 State,India.There's a{Mercedes}made in
 1912 with wooden wheels,a sunroof &amp; a 
 spare wheel and a racing car which is 
 a Light Weight Special made in 1931.  
 There are some children's pedal cars  
 and some old motorbikes.On the wall is
 a{penny farthing bicycle}from 1870,   
 also lots of car badges.Outside is an 
 old yellow car.We noticed there was   
 alot of chrome on the cars.There are  
 old petrol pumps,mechanics tools,and  
 advertising boards,as well as costumes
 from the period.                      </content>
