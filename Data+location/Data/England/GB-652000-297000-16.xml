		<title>16Nudist Beach</title>
		<content> A nudist beach was started at Corton  
in  1979 by the Waveney District       
Council.It was instigated by the       
chairman, Mr.Nicholas Brighouse, who   
saw  a growing demand for this type of 
pastime. In 1982 an old law had to be  
rescinded by Parliament so that        
Gentlemen might legally swim without   
clothes on. Ladies had always had that 
right. The section of beach stretches  
three groins lengths South from Tramps 
Alley.
