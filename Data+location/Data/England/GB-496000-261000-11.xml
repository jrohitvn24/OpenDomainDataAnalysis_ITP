		<title>11WHAT CAN WE BUY?</title>
		<content> Bottled{milk}is delivered to houses   
 and farms every day.  There is        
 currently a choice of roundsmen, both 
 coming from outside the area.         
                                       
 There is{no shop}in the village, so   
 even for a loaf of bread it is        
 necessary to make a trip to Sharnbrook
 or further afield. (The village       
 bakehouse now serves as accommodation 
 for a car!) A few people keep poultry 
 but they produce only enough{eggs}for 
 themselves and their friends.         
                                       
 The Evening Telegraph{newspaper}is    
 produced in Bedford every day except  
 Sunday.  A lady in Souldrop village   
 delivers it every night to those      
 houses that buy it.  The free paper   
 'Bedford on Sunday' is delivered to   
 all the houses in the area.
