		<title>04SCHOOLING IN KINGSCLERE</title>
		<content>  Children in Kingsclere may start in  
 one of the three play-schools, which  
 meet in the Youth Club or the         
 Community Centre.                     
  In the school term in which you are  
 five years of age you go to{Kingsclere
{Primary School.}This now has modern   
 buildings, the infant block having    
 opened in 1972, and the junior block  
 in 1980. The old buildings are soon to
 be sold and probably demolished. There
 is a swimming-pool, built in 1973, and
 a large field for playing football,   
 rounders and other activities.        
  In our school we use television,     
 radio, a video-recorder, and our two  
 micro-computers.                      
  After leaving their primary school at
 about eleven years of age, children go
 to the{Clere School}at Burghclere,    
 five miles away. They travel there    
 each day on one of several coaches.   </content>
