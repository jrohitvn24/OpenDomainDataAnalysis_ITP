 We interviewed Mrs.C.Presswood,Parish 
 Councillor,who explained there are 17 
 councillors who are elected by people 
 who live in the village whose names   
 are on the electoral roll.Their job is
 to keep an eye on how the village     
 grows.They are responsible for looking
 after the Civic Hall,Poynton Park the 
 street lighting on estates footpaths  
 across fields,they are allowed a small
 sum from the general rate to pay for  
 this.They see the main problem in 1985
 in Poynton as being the need for a    
 by-pass round the village to avoid the
 heavy increase in through traffic     
 which will occur when the Hazel Grove 
 by-pass is opened.The Parish Council  
 feel that Poynton should not grow any 
 larger,and aim to protect the green   
 belt,and consolidate what we have got.</content>
