		<content>   This is the largest and most        
noticeable man-made feature in the     
district and was first built in the    
teeth of strong local opposition.      
With the passage of time people have   
become more resigned but it is still   
unpopular because of the unpleasant    
smells produced and the eye-sore it    
constitutes.   It covers a sizeable    
plot and there are a number of low     
sheds placed round a tall silo where   
grain is stored and ground for poultry 
feed.   Because of the flat landscape  
the silo tower is visible over a wide  
area.
