		<title>14Housing in Thurcroft</title>
		<content> We wanted to find out about the       
 Housing in Thurcroft.We did a survey, 
 the first question we asked was "What 
 kind of house do you live in".We found
 out that 58% are semi_detached.Also we
 found out that 22% of the houses are  
 terraced and only 8% of the houses are
 detached. This means that there are   
 not very many large detached houses in
 Thurcroft.The second question we asked
 was who owned the house. We found out 
 that 44% of the houses are council and
 35% of the houses are private and 21% 
 of the houses are owned by the        
 National Coal Board.The third question
 we asked was "How old is the house".We
 found out that only 4% of the houses  
 in Thurcroft are less than 5 years    
 old. This means that not many new     
 houses have been built over the last 5
 years.We found that 72% of the houses 
 are over 20 years old.                </content>
