		<title>10TOURISM - ASHDOWN FOREST</title>
		<content>   A.A.Milne who lived at Cotchford    
 Farm on the edge of Ashdown Forest    
 wrote Winnie the Pooh and House at    
 Pooh Corner.  The illustrator of the  
 books, E.H.Shepard, stayed with him   
 there and together they capture an    
 essence of the Forest in the books.   
   Owl's House in the Hundred Acre wood
 can be identified in the 500 Acre     
 Wood; the Sandy Place where Roo and   
 Piglet practised jumping and the Lone 
 Pine Tree are near to Gill's Lap, the 
 Enchanted Place on the top of the     
 Forest and thousands of tourists make 
 their way to Pooh Bridge, not far from
 Cotchford Farm, to play Pooh Sticks.  
   Close to Gill's Lap there is now a  
 memorial to A.A.Milne and E.H.Shepard 
 whose inspired collaberation gave the 
 Pooh books to the world.
