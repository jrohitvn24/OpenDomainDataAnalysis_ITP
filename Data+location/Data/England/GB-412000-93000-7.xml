		<title>07THE HIGH STREET</title>
		<content> The{High Street}is quite an old       
 road.When you first come into         
 Christchurch you see the rivers and   
 their floodplains and then you see the
 roundabout with the trees and the     
 flowers on it.{Saxon Square}is new    
 with lots of new shops in it.It cost  
 a lot of money to build.It was opened 
 by the Mayor on the 28th September    
 1983.It is a quiet shopping centre and
 overlooking it is a church.If you go  
 further on down the road towards the  
{Priory}the shops begin to get smaller 
 and older .Also there there is a pub  
 called{The Olde George Inn}which years
 ago the horses and carts came to.The  
 High Street although it is the main   
 road is very narrow but still         
 hundreds of cars go along that road   
 every day.
