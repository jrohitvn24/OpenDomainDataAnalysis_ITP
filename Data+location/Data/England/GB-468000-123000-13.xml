		<title>13RELIGION - LANGRISH CHURCH</title>
		<content> Langrish Church was built in the 1870 
 by the Nicholsons of Bordean House as 
 a family church.The builders made it  
 in the style of an old Norman church. 
 It has no historical significance.    
 The church is the only community      
 building in Langrish and is a focus   
 for the village.The upkeep of the     
 church is paid by the congregation and
 they keep it clean.The congregation is
 between 15 and 20 people which is 5_6%
 higher than average.A few festivals   
 are held there each year such as the  
 harvest festival,funerals and         
 weddings.The vicar has to come from   
 E.Meon so a local lady runs the Sunday
 School.The people generally only take 
 interest in the church at major       
 festival seasons.The age range of     
 attendants is widespread with the only
 gap being the 13-22 age group. Other  
 churches are at Froxfield &amp; Bordean.  </content>
