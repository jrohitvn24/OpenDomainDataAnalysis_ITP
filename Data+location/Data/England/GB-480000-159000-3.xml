		<content>{Yateley was mentioned in the          
 original Domesday Book but evidence of
 settlement in this area goes back to  
 the Stone Age.  Arrowheads and stone  
 axes and Bronze Age burial urns have  
 been unearthed.The Saxons arrived in  
 AD 700.  Yateley, as part of Crondall 
 Hundred, originally appears as a      
 bequest to the old Monastery,         
 Winchester.   The early cottages of   
 Yateley were around The Green on which
 cottagers grazed their livestock.     
 Each family farmed their strip of     
 land.   By the 13th Century Yateley   
 was a properous, vigorous community,  
 although in Medieval times the greater
 greater part of this area was open    
 heathland. Yateley Hall (a            
 pre-Elizabethan Manor House) was once 
 surrounded by a moat and has a priest 
 hole and the wisteria is probably the 
 oldest in the country.                </content>
