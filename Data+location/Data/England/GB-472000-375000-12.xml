		<content>  The roads are all minor ones linking 
 the area with the A638 to the         
 West.Local residents, farm traffic and
 delivery and collection vehicles(milk,
 animal foodstuffs, oil, general       
 merchandise) use them.                
  The East Midland Service 36 bus(The  
 Sherwood Forester) links the villages 
 with Retford,Tuxford and Ollerton.Four
 journeys proceed in each direction    
 (weekdays) they are used lightly      
 mainly by shoppers and children.Some  
 households lack private transport.    
  The railway from London to the North 
 passes throgh the area;Retford is the 
 nearest railhead.The line is being    
 electrified;the poles are already     
 positioned.Recent increases in train  
 speeds have resulted in the closure of
 a public road crossing and certain    
 farm occupation crossings. A loop is  
 retained for slower southbound trains.</content>
