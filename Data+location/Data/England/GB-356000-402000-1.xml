		<content>This block lies just to the south of   
Wigan town centre. It includes Newtown,
Goose Green and Lower Ince and one of  
Britain's largest areas of derelict    
industrial landscape, now being slowly 
reclaimed by nature.                   
  Many other changes have taken place. 
Unemployment and broken marriages are  
widespread. Lower Ince is shrinking as 
old terraced houses are demolished,    
while new private housing spreads out  
at Hawkley Hall and Marus Bridge       
drawing some "incomers" from           
Merseyside. These shifts are reflected 
in imminent school reorganisation.     
However the population is remarkably   
static. There are differences of speech
and identity between, say, the Newtown 
and Ince communities. Working-class    
traditions of diet, sport, churchgoing,
clubs and voting Labour are still kept;
and local pride, if insular, is warm.  </content>
