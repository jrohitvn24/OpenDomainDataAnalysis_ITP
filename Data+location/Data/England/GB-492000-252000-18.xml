		<content> The director of British School        
 Technolgy saw that many schoolchildren
 are still only taught traditional     
 craf and design skills. A pilot scheme
 in Bedfordshire of a mobile Technology
 Bus visiting schools was so successful
 that Government now funds B.S.T. to   
 help any education authority introduce
 technology courses into their schools.
 Complemented by services at Trent     
 Polytechnic, Nottingham the Unit      
 provides: consultancy to local        
 authorities, in service teacher       
 training, technician training courses,
 curriculum evaluation and development 
 and supply and conversion of mobile   
 technology units. B.S.T> currently has
 over 30 enquiries and firm orders for 
 vehicle conversions and 10 authorities
 have requested consultation.          
 Bedfordshire has 6 mobile Technology  
 Units visiting 10 schools per week.   </content>
