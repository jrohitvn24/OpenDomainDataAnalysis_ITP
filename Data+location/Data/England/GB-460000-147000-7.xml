		<content> The Community policeman is involved in
 enforcing law and order and also in   
 the social life of the community. As  
 well as enforcing law and order and   
 attending to domestic disturbances and
 complaints about noise, he or she will
 attend meetings outside working hours 
 e.g. Residents' Associations. Contacts
 are maintained with schools, where the
 Community Policeman may be involved in
 talking to the children about road    
 safety or the dangers of talking to   
 strangers.                            
    Crime on the estate in the north is
 quite high and is characterised by    
 vandalism and petty theft.
