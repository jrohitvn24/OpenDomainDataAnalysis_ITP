		<content> The A19 which runs north-south on the 
 low lying land in the west of the     
 D-block, is a major road connecting   
 the industrial areas of Teesside and  
 Wearside to the main routes south (A1 
 &amp; M1). It has always been a major     
 routeway. In the days of the          
 stagecoach the Tontine Inn was built  
 at the junction of the Thirsk-Yarm and
 Thirsk-Sunderland roads. It now stands
 at the junction of the A19 and A172.  
 The A172 skirts the higher land of the
 Cleveland Hills and connects the      
 villages lying at the foot of these   
 hills to the market town of Stokesley.
 A road climbs the hills along the     
 route of the Old Drove Road through   
 Scarth Nick down towards Osmotherley. 
 There is an infrequent bus service in 
 the area. The nearest rail connection 
 is at Northallerton. Teesside Airport,
 near Darlington also serves this area.</content>
