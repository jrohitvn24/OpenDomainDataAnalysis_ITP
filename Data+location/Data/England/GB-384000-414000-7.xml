		<content> Norden is a quiet, semi-rural area    
 near to open moorland and hill farms. 
 The local police patrol up to the     
 boundary near to Red Lumb at the foot 
 of Knowl Moor.                        
    The area is popular for its walks  
 among the hills but this can lead to  
 friction with farmers concerned over  
 the problem of walkers' dogs worrying 
 their sheep. Occasionally dogs have   
 been shot although prosecutions for   
 trespass or sheep worrying are rare.  
    Norden village has its own         
 community policeman, Eddie Reeder, who
 patrols only in the village itself and
 has regular contact with local        
 schools. He lives in Norden and gets  
 around on a bike which, he says, can  
 take him places a car could not.
