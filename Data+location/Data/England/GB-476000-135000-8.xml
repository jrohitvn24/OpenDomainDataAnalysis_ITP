		<title>08HOUSING IN THE BORDON AREA</title>
		<content>   Bordon is a large village but it is 
 quickly developing into a small       
 town.New housing estates are being    
 built all the time and the old houses 
 are being demolished or updated.Before
 this new development the main         
 residential area belonged to the      
 army.There is some council development
 and now a vast increse in private     
 residential areas.                    
                                       
   To the west of Bordon there are     
 small rural settlements such as       
 Oakhanger, Binswood and Shortheath.   
 There are not  many houses in these   
 areas but there are quite a few farms 
 and cottages,on the east side of      
 Bordon. On both sides of the          
 A325,there are mainly army            
 residential areas including a         
 hospital for the armed forces.
