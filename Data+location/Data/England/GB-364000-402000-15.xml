 THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF INTEREST IN   
 THE{TRAFFIC SITUATION}IN DAISY HILL   
 OVER THE LAST TWELVE MONTHS.  ARTICLES
 HAVE APPEARED IN THE LOCAL NEWSPAPERS 
 AND THE{POLICE}HAVE CONDUCTED TRAFFIC 
 SURVEYS.  WE DECIDED TO FIND OUT WHAT 
 THE VIEWS ARE OF THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE  
 IN DAISY HILL.                        
                                       
 CHILDREN FROM OUR CLASS INTERVIEWED   
 TWENTY THREE PEOPLE, SIXTEEN ADULTS   
 AND SEVEN CHILDREN.  WE NOTED DOWN    
 WHAT{TYPE OF ROADUSERS}THEY WERE.     
 SOME USED THE ROADS FOR{CYCLING AND   
{DRIVING CARS. }OTHERS WERE{PASSENGERS 
 IN THE BACK OF CARS AND SOME WERE BUS 
 PASSENGERS.  ALL OF THEM, AT SOMETIME,
 WERE{PEDESTRIANS. }WE FOUND OUT FOR   
 HOW MANY YEARS PEOPLE HAD BEEN USING  
 THE ROADS IN DAISY HILL. (CONT P.16)
