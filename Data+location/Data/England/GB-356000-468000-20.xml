		<title>20The Future</title>
		<content>It is difficult to predict what may    
happen in the future but there have    
been some recent developments which may
help to indicate possible future       
trends.                                
Employment within the immediate area is
limited; many of our young people will 
have to move away to find work, or at  
least be prepared to commute. For those
who do stay the problem is one of being
able to afford property in the area.   
House prices are high and this has led 
to fewer young families residing in the
area. Consequently school numbers have 
fallen among the younger age groups. If
this trend continues the age structure 
of the area will become increasingly   
elderly.                               
The local secondary school has resisted
pressures to close due to its small    
size. If numbers continue to fall the  
closure of the school may occur.       </content>
