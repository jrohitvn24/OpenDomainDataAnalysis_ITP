 ALLOTMENTS ON ARBURY ROAD/HISTON ROAD,
 TWO POST OFFICES WITH SHOPS ON KING'S 
 HEDGES ROAD AND CAMERON ROAD.         
 ALTOGETHER WE WENT ON 10 TRIPS.ONE OF 
 THESE TRIPS WAS TO CAMBRIDGE SCIENCE  
 PARK TO LOOK AROUND.ANOTHER TRIP WAS  
 TO THE THURSDAY MARKET WHERE WE ASKED 
 THE STALLHOLDERS SOME QUESTIONS.WE    
 ALSO LOOKED AT THE PRIMARY SCHOOLS    
 WHICH SERVE THE POPULATION WITHIN OUR 
 AREA.THE AREA HAS A POPULATION OF OVER
 5,000;A PLAY AREA IS AVAILABLE FOR THE
 VERY YOUNG CHILDREN,BUT RECREATIONAL  
 FACILITES FOR THE KING'S HEDGES ESTATE

 ENJOYED THE WAY WE HAVE CARRIED OUT   
 OUR SURVEY OF THE DOMESDAY PROJECT,   
 ALTHOUGH THE VISIT TO THE SEWAGE WORKS
 WAS NOT QUITE SO SWEET.VICKY CONLAN,
