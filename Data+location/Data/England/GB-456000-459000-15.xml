		<title>15JACOBEAN HOTEL</title>
		<content> In the west of this area there is a   
 country road running north-south.  At 
 the extreme south- west corner of the 
 area there are crossroads.            
 A small wooded area of conifers and   
 deciduous trees is to be found in the 
 extreme south of the area.            
 The land is flat and low-lying.       
 Fields are bordered by well           
 established hawthorn hedges.          
 There is an hotel, now called The     
 Jacobean, but previously known as The 
 Plainville Hotel, in the northwest of 
 the area.  The hotel is surrounded by 
 deciduous trees and has a large       
 well-kept garden to the rear.         
 The farm, Plainville Farm, is situated
 next door and is mainly arable.       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
