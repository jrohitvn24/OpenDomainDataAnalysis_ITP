		<content> WE LOOKED CLOSELY AT ONE OF THE FINE  
 FARMS IN THE PLUMLEY AREA.            
    IT IS OWNED BY A YOUNG MAN,JUST    
 RECENTLY MARRIED AND HAS BEEN IN THE  
 FAMILY SINCE 1920.                    
    THE CATTLE ARE BOUGHT IN AND FED ON
 CROPS GROWN AT THE FARM.A HELICOPTER  
 IS HIRED TO SPRAY THE CROPS,BUT       
 EVERYTHING ELSE IS DONE BY THE        
 FARMER,APART FROM THE OCCASIONAL VISIT
 FROM THE VET.ALL THE MACHINERY IS     
 SECOND-HAND,SELF-MAINTAINED AND VERY  
 RELIABLE.                             
    THE FARM GROWS ALL THAT IS NEEDED  
 IN THE FOOD-LINE,BUT THE FARMER WILL  
 NOT EAT HIS OWN BEASTS.               
    AN UNCLE LOOKS AFTER THE FARM WHEN 
 THE FARMER GOES ON HOLIDAY,USUALLY    
 ONCE A YEAR.                          
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
