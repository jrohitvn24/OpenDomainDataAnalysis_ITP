{Q. How many tourists visit the Gardens
 A. Last year we had a record number of
 visitors, about 24,000 paid fees plus 
 local people who pay nothing.         
{Q. As a Governor what is your         
{involvement with Pocklington School?} 
 A. My father was headmaster from 1915 
 to 1944. I became clerk to the        
 governors in 1942 and retired in 1975.
 At my last meeting I was co-opted as a
 governor and I have been ever since.  
{Q. What changes have you seen?}       
 A. The school has roughly doubled in  
 size since 1944, with equal numbers of
 boarders and day boys who are         
 brought in by bus and car.            </content>
