		<content>     The Edenbridge Leisure Centre was 
 opened in 1984 and was granted by the 
 Sports Council. The facilities for    
 sport are as follows:_ 4 squash       
 courts, a fully_equipped weight       
 training room, and a hall that can    
 cater for a variety of sports from    
 badminton to archery. Upstairs is a   
 relaxation area for both adults and   
 children. Already a number of non_    
 sporting events have been held in the 
 hall, for example, roller discos,     
 dances, public meetings and BMX(stunt 
 bikes) competitions. To use the       
 facilities one must be a member or be 
 accompanied by a member. Annual       
 membership charges are :_Adult Â£6;    
 Family Â£12; under 18 Â£4. For people   
 living outside the town the costs are 
 increased by 25%. A member still pays 
 hire charges on top of this to use the
 various facilities...by Richard Weaver</content>
