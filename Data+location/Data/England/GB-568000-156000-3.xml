		<title>03A day at Ditton Junior</title>
		<content> I am Sarah, age 11, and in my last    
 term of Junior School. This is what   
 usually happens on Mondays. The bell  
 rings at 08.55 and we stand still in  
 the playground waiting for our class  
 to be called in by the teacher on     
 duty. Inside we hang up our coats and 
 walk quietly to the classroom. Our    
 teacher takes the register and asks   
 how many people are having school     
 dinner. Most children bring           
 sandwiches. The first lesson is       
 Country Dancing. We love Sword        
 Dancing. In the classroom we have     
 Maths and English. At playtime I play 
 marbles with Susan. She usually wins. 
 After play we carry on with our work. 
 If we get stuck our teacher explains  
 it. In the afternoon we have Rounders 
 unless it rains. People miss Rounders 
 if they have not done their work.
