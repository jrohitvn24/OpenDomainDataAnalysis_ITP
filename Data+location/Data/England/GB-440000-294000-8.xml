		<title>08Richmond. My holiday.</title>
		<content> All was a rush on a saturday          
 morning, packing the things into the  
 car.we were going to Hunstanton.Atlast
 we left the house.We went twenty miles
 then we stopted at a little chef inn  
 to have something  to eat.I had a     
 pepsi cola and a American pancake.we  
 set off again .We passed an orchard   
 and Queen Ann's wood.We went round    
 king's Lynn.We could now see the      
 seaside.When we got to Hunstanton we  
 were all very excited.When we got to  
 the caravan site dad collected the    
 keys.As we went to the caravan we     
 passed a park.I can't remeber the     
 number but I think it was 132.It was  
 quite nice inside the caravan there   
 was a shower in the bath room.On      
 Monday it was the best day, we went   
 swimming for 12 hours and we had lunch
 there.I had a drink of orange squash, 
 etc. and then came home on Saturday.  </content>
