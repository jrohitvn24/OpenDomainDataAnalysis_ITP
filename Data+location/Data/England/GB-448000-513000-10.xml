		<content> The housing in Hemlington is quite    
 modern.  Most of the housing is less  
 than 15 years old. A lot of the       
 houses are owned by the{Council}or    
{housing associations}but there are    
 some private houses. The{farmhouse}is 
 much older. It was mentioned in a book
 over 170 years ago.                   
                                       
 We did an{unemployment survey}of      
 parents. We found that 58% of all the 
 parents are either{unemployed}or are  
{housewives.                           
  In Hemlington there are community    
 centres, sports facilities and        
 self-help groups.
