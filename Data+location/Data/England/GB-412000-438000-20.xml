		<title>20ELDWICK AND GILSTEAD JOIN ?</title>
		<content> Until about thirty years ago this area
 completely separated the two villages 
 of{ELDWICK and GILSTEAD}.Today it now 
 contains the largest{housing estates  
 in the whole neighbourhood.The{Heaton}
{Estate}developed all the open land to 
 the West of Warren Lane,right up to   
 the edge of the former Gilstead Moor  
 Quarries.It included a{general store. 
 Part of the Moor is covered in water  
 by the{Gilstead Filter Beds}which are 
 on the underground aquaduct from the  
 reservoirs in Nidderdale to Bradford. 
 On the East side a new{Middle School  
 takes local children from 9 to 13 yrs 
 A few fields were left on that side   
 until about 200 houses were built in  
 1979. Old people in the area said no  
 more could be built because there used
 to be delphstone mines under the land.
{In June 1985 builders planned to add  
{129 houses after a Public Enquiry.    </content>
