		<title>03A child's life in Hazelton.</title>
		<content> During the summer evenings Caroline   
 does her piano practice,and if its hot
 she sometimes has a water fight with  
 freezer bags filled with water.   She 
 also watches television.   Sometimes  
 Caroline helps out at a friends       
 guesthouse serving the customers.     
 For pocket money she and her friend   
 cut lawns and are paid approximately  
 two or three pounds.   She also goes  
 sailing in the family boat at South   
 Cerney.   There is no special         
 playground for young children in      
 Hazelton but sometimes she and her    
 friends play around the village roads 
 on their bicycles.   There are        
 approxiamtely 100 people living in    
 Hazelton,but there are no shops,      
 school or post office.Caroline says "I
 prefer to live in the country because 
 its quiet and pretty".
