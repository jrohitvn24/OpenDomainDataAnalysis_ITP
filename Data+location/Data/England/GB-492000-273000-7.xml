Hounds there is one chimney pot and one
garage that can fit two cars in.There  
is a vent pipe sticking out of the roof
it is to let air flow from and to the  
sewage system of the house.It has a    
patio around the back and a big porch  
at the front.All the windows are square
or rectangle in shape.There is a hole  
around the back of the house which is  
called a soak away.Pipes from the roof 
come down into it and soak into the    
ground.When it is finished it is filled
up with stones.The house that was built
on the foundations of a bungalow has   
two chimney pots and a plaque which    
says when it was finished. It has an   
alarm system on the side and two       
garages.It also has a drive.There are  
no new houses in Lt Addington being    
built at present.
