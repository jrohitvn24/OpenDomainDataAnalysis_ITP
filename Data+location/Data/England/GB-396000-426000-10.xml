		<content>{Mr.Harold Hodgson Crabtree}has lived  
 in Hebden Bridge all his life. He was 
 born in Hebden Bridge, went to Central
 Street school, and then to Hebden     
 Bridge Grammar School, which is now   
 Riverside Junior School. He left      
 school at fourteen and began shoe     
 repairing. He now owns his own shoe   
 shops and has been in the shoe        
 business all his life. He was in the  
 Army during the second world war. He  
 became a local councillor in 1955.He  
 was the mayor of Hebden Royd. He has  
 seen many changes in Hebden Bridge    
 since wind up gramophones. He         
 remembers horses and carts carrying   
 goods as there were few motor         
 vehicles. Buses couldn't go to Hebden 
 Bridge because they hadn't the power  
 to go up Bridge Lanes. Trams ran from 
 Hebden Bridge to Halifax. He says     
 Hebden Bridge today is much cleaner.  </content>
