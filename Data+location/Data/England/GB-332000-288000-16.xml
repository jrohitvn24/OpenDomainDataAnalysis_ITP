		<title>16PRAM RACE</title>
		<content>    This year Bishops Castle held the  
 first Pram Race.It was a great success
 with over twenty entrants.There were  
 about four  people to a pram.One      
 person was the "baby" sitting in the  
 pram and the others pushed it from pub
 to pub around the town, seven in all. 
                                       
  They were all in fancy dress         
 ranging from Vikings,who won a prize  
 for their costumes, to Bunny Girls.   
                                       
    Each "baby" had to drink half a    
 pint of something in each pub.        
                                       
    Everyone finished and the Rugby    
 Club won in 10 minutes 11seconds.     
    It was a great success and will    
 probably be staged as an annual event.
