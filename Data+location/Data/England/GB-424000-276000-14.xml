		<title>14DISUSED RAILWAY</title>
		<content> The disused railway line is more like 
 a country path than a once used       
 railway. It is now completely         
 overgrown with weeds and grass. There 
 are a lot of wild flowers as well as  
 stinging nettles which are growing by 
 the side of it as well as all over it.
 Hawthorn, oak and sycamore trees are  
 also growing along the track. We      
 picked up some clinker from the path. 
 These are bits of stone which were    
 left at the bottom of the furnace in  
 steam engines and were thrown out by  
 the fireman on the train. We passed   
 under 3 bridges and noticed black     
 marks still on the bridges. These     
 marks are from the smoke which rose   
 from the old steam engines. There was 
 ivy growing over the bridges. The     
 track runs from Burton Green to       
 Berkswell and measures 2572 metres.
