		<content>  Farmire Fishery, at Farnham, is a    
 privately owned trout fishery.        
  Scotton Village Hall, built in 1977, 
 is the venue for many events,         
 including evening classes, arts and   
 crafts shows, and a weekly Old Tyme   
 Sequence Dancing class.               
  Across the road from the hall is the 
 North Yorkshire County Council Playing
 Field. Scotton has its own cricket    
 team.                                 
  Brearton Village Hall is used for    
 Women's Institute meetings, Youth Club
 and church fundraising events.        
  Footpaths and bridleways in the area 
 are well signposted.                  
  Gymkhanas are held at Gibbet Hill    
 Farm, Farnham, in aid of the Royal    
 National Lifeboat Institution.
