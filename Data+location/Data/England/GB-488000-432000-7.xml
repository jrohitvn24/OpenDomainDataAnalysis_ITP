		<title>07A CHOSEN N.CAVE,HOTHAM WALK</title>
		<content>    My favourite walk is a circular    
 walk round Hotham.  I live in North   
 Cave, but Hotham is a smaller, quieter
 and, in my opinion,  more attractive  
 village.  I walk along a windy road   
 (895329 public footpath) with an      
 abundance of flowers and a lot of     
 fields.  That's why I like walking    
 this route in summer because the      
 fields are golden and the flowers are 
 open and the trees in full leaf.   I  
 really enjoy this part of the walk. We
 stroll into the main village and turn 
 right through the gate, past Hotham   
 Hall by the woods and past baa-ing    
 sheep over the cattle grid.   Turn    
 right to Nordham and our house.   I   
 recommend this walk because it's      
 quiet, attractive and very enjoyable.
