		<title>11Burton School Field</title>
		<content> Our school is surrounded by a large   
 field. We are now most likely going to
 lose it.  The Council wants to sell   
 our school field.  We feel this is not
 good because it might stop some       
 sports activities.  The land was given
 for a school and sports field by      
 Major Campbell, who used to live in   
 Burton Hall, a large Georgian house   
 adjacent to the school.               
                                       
 The field is a great asset to our     
 school, but not absolutely essential. 
 We could just fit in our running track
 without it, but it is good to have the
 field so that we can do sports        
 activities and play tennis and block  
 in the summer.  The Education         
 Committee wants our field as it needs 
 the money for books, schools, interior
 decor, playgrounds, etc. in other     
 parts of the County.                  </content>
