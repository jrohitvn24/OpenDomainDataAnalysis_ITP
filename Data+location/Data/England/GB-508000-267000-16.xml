		<title>16Kimbolton - Religion</title>
		<content> Non-conformity has flourished in      
 Kimbolton since the mid C17,largely   
 supported by tradespeople.The parish  
 church has tended to be for the gentry
 and their servants.In this century the
 pattern has changed.The{Baptist Church
 is the Youth Club,the{Methodist Chapel
 is in private hands,the{Moravian      
{Church} with a congregation of 200 in 
 1900 which has shrunk to 5 is having  
 to be abandoned as unsafe.The tiny    
 Roman{Catholic chapel,}the upper room 
 of an old cottage,survives.{The Church
{of England}soldiers on,with an average
 congregation at Kimbolton of 60,and at
 Tilbrook,which has an Anglo-Catholic  
 tradition,of15.The main problems are  
 lack of clergy (the resident vicar    
 serves six other parishes) and lack of
 funds for urgent and expensive        
 building repair.
