		<title>19TRANSPORT IN HOLBERROW GREEN</title>
		<content> There are 3 main roads that cut       
 through the area and provide the main 
 routes for communcation. A422 which   
 runs from Worcester to Stratford upon 
 Avon.  B4092 which connects Holberrow 
 Green to Astwood Bank and thus        
 Redditch.  B4090 which is the main    
 Droitwich to Alcester road.           
 Most people use privately owned motor 
 cars.  Some have bicycles.  Car       
 ownership is fairly essential in this 
 area as public transport is very      
 limited.                              
                                       
 There are two Midland Red buses to    
 Redditch and one from Redditch per day
 through Holberrow Green on B 4092.    
 A local coach company provides school 
 bus runs twice a day, solely for      
 school children.  There is also a     
 shopping bus service to neighbouring  
 towns.                                </content>
