		<title>15CLUBS FOR CHILDREN</title>
		<content> The children in our area can join in  
 lots of organised activities if they  
 want to.                              
 Marching bands or jazz bands have been
 popular for a long time in the Durham 
 coalfield. Recently people in this    
 area became interested in these bands 
 and have organised their own.         
 The children wear smart, bright       
 uniforms and march with a banner and  
 play tunes on simple instruments.     
 There are lots of competitions to find
 the best marching band in the whole   
 region and the bands appear at summer 
 fairs and carnivals.                  
 There are three different bands in    
 Creswell at the moment. The Creswell  
 Craglanders were the first, followed  
 by the Breakaways. Now the main band  
 is the Red Devils.
