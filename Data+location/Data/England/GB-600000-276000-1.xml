		<content>The block covers virtually the whole of
Hinderclay, most of Thelnetham and a   
small portion of Redgrave; with a very 
narrow strip of Blo Norton. With the   
exception of this strip of Norfolk the 
area is situated in Suffolk. In the    
North-east corner is the dual source of
the rivers Waveney and Little Ouse. The
Waveney flows East while the Ouse flows
West along the northern edge to form   
the boundary between Norfolk &amp; Suffolk.
The population of the entire block is  
only 440. The houses range from some   
with 15th Century timber-frames to     
brick built modern houses. Most houses 
are detached but a few, mostly Council 
built, are semi-detached. No major     
roads run through the area, only narrow
country lanes. The nearest railway     
station is at Diss which is on the main
London line.                           
                                       </content>
