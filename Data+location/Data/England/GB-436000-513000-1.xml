		<content>    The area consists of 10x1km squares
 of{farmland}to the north, which are   
 dominated by 2x1km squares containing 
{Teeside Airport}to the south.         
                                       
    Individual farmhouses  exist in    
 these squares,as well as some         
 residential houses in the west, which 
 were once part of the officers        
 quarters when the airfield belonged to
 the RAF.                              
    To the east there is part of the   
 British Chrome Chemicals plant,next to
 the railway line which runs west-east 
 across the whole area and includes one
 station at the airport.               
    Many of the original RAF buildings 
 at the airport have diversified with  
 many new uses, eg the airport hotel, a
 tennis and sports centre, a fire      
 training centre, an old people's home,
 a flying school and student homes.    </content>
