		<content> could go again but that was another   
 week.                                 
     Many people like to come to our   
 area to walk,or to birdwatch,or other 
 activities associated with open       
 countryside.We live right on the edge 
 of the Peak District National Park and
 on weekends in the Summer the local   
 roads are quite busy with travellers  
 from Manchester and other cities.     
 Sport is a popular recreation.Soccer  
 is one our favourite games,played     
 mostly by males. Cricket is another   
 popular game played in the Summer.    
      Many of the local public houses  
 have darts teams and many pubs also   
 have pool tables.                     
     In school the boys play football  
 and the girls play netball.In the     
 Summer we play rounders.We play       
 matches against other schools in these
 games.                                </content>
