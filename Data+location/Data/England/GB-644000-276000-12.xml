",etc.Grown ups play some games as well
as children.                           
    Indoor games that we play are      
"monopoly",when you try to get as much 
money as you can by buying hotels and  
houses,"Breakout",when you have to find
the way out of a maze using a dice to  
move.Most people play games with       
playing cards - rummy,snap,draw the    
well dry,pontoon,patience and whist.A  
lot of the indoor games are played by  
the whole family.Scrabble is a good    
game - you have to make words with lots
of little plastic tiles,you score      
points for each letter in the word.Most
indoor games are bought from shops     
often as presents at Christmas or      
birthdays.
