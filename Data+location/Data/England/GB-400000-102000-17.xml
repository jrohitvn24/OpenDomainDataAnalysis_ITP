		<content>{High Hall}is situated on a hill in    
 Stanbridge. It has been in the        
 Gibsons' family since it was built    
 (1680-1690). The land owned around the
 house is 500 acres, Mrs Gibson lets   
 250 acres to each of the two farmers  
 for farming. Private fishing amd      
 boating takes place; the money from   
 these helps to keep the house.        
      There are thirty-two rooms in the
 house, but only half the house is     
 used. Living in the house are the     
 owner, her two children, the lodger,  
 and the modern part of the building is
 let to a family.                      
      The owner leads a peaceful and   
 simple home life. She takes her       
 daughter to private school every      
 morning. Her hobbies are gardening and
 listening to music. The owner employs 
 a housekeeper who comes once a week,  
 and a gardener.                       </content>
