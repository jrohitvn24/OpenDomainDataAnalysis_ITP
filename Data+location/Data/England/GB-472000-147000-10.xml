		<content> THERE ARE TWO PUBLIC HOUSES IN OUR    
 AREA, (APART FROM THE NAAFI CLUB ON   
 THE RAF STATION), THE FOUR HORSESHOES 
 JUST OUTSIDE THE VILLAGE OF LONG      
 SUTTON, AND THE POACHERS, IN THE      
 VILLAGE OF SOUTH WARNBOROUGH.  BOTH   
 PUBS ARE USUALLY QUITE BUSY AND       
 ATTRACT PEOPLE FROM OUTSIDE THE       
 VILLAGES AS WELL AS HAVING A STEADY   
 TRADE FROM LOCAL PEOPLE.  THE POACHERS
 IN PARTICULAR IS BUSY BECAUSE IT IS   
 ACTUALLY IN THE VILLAGE AND SERVES HOT
 MEALS AND EXCELLENT SALADS AT LUNCH   
 TIMES AND IN THE EVENINGS. THERE ARE  
 MANY LOCAL PEOPLE WHO GO INTO THESE   
 PUBS TO MEET FRIENDS AND PLAY THE     
 USUAL PUB GAMES SUCH AS DARTS.        
 BECAUSE THERE ARE NO OTHER FACILITIES 
 THESE PUBS ARE IMPORTANT AS THEY      
 PROVIDE THE AREA WITH FOCAL POINTS.   
                                       
                                       </content>
