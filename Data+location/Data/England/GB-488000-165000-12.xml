		<title>12INTERVIEWS WITH GOLFERS.</title>
		<content>   We interviewed several golfers about
 their use of the{Berkshire Golf Club.}
 All the golfers interviewd were quite 
 elderly and enjoyed the recreational  
 value of the sport.  They liked the   
 friendly atmosphere of the club and   
 all thought that the{facilities}were  
 excellent.  These include a           
 restaurant, two bars, changing rooms  
 with showers and a rest room with     
 billiards and card tables.  Some      
 golfers had been members for up to    
 thirty years, some travelled over     
 twenty miles to play and all those    
 interviewed used the Golf Club more   
 than once a week.                     
   From Mondays to Fridays societies   
 come for a day and go round both      
 courses.  At the weekends it is       
 members only.  There is a ten year    
 waiting list and only ten people are  
 admitted each year.                   </content>
