		<title>12A day in my life (cont.)</title>
		<content>   The morning lesson begins with maths
 or English until 12.00p.m. with a     
 twenty minute break at 10.40a.m. For  
 lunch I have sandwiches. Cheese and   
 Branston Pickle is my favourite. I    
 don't go outside at lunchbreak,       
 instead I read my book. In the        
 afternoon we usualy do project work,  
 Art and Craft or Games. We finish     
 school at 3.30p.m.I walk home with my 
 friend, and get home at 3.45p.m.I go  
 inside and upstairs to change,then I  
 go downstairs for tea. I always have  
 something different, as variety is the
 spice of life. I usually read until   
 7.30p.m. and watch television until   
 8.30p.m.
