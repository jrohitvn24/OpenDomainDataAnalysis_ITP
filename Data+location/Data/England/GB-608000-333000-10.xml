		<content> A farm on the Barningham Road is oddly
 named Fuel Farm. It was originally    
 owned by the parish and the income    
 from it was used to buy coalfor the   
 elderly. It has now been sold but the 
 interest from the proceeds is still   
 divided among the pensioners of the   
 village who have lived here for more  
 than five years.                      
 Two bungalows in the village are owned
 by the parish council: they were      
 built for the use of elderly poor     
 villagers in November 1916, with money
 from an anonymous donor.              
 Another act of charity was to allow   
 the bachelors of the village, if they 
 had a gun licence, to shoot on land   
 near Fuel Farm.                       
 The Simon Woodrow Trust has $2.50 per 
 annum administered by the church to   
 assist '5 poor and needy widows'.
