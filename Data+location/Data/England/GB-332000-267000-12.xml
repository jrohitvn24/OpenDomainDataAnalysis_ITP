		<title>12RELIGION WILLEY CHAPEL</title>
		<content> Built in 1869 on Old Hall land, the   
 chapel replaced an earlier chapel in  
 Pound Lane.                           
 In 1937 Hergest chapel was dismantled 
 and re erected alongside to accomodate
 the Sunday school and other community 
 events.It is the current venue of     
 Willey &amp; District Women's Institute.  
 Large teas were once provided by the  
 farmers wives to feed the congregation
 between Sunday services and on other  
 occasions. Attendence dwindling to    
 less than 10 persons, the catering    
 burden fell on too few people and was 
 dropped. The 1969 centenary           
 celebration programme shows the once  
 considerable committment of the local 
 community to the chapel.              
 Residents now attend services at      
 Lingen church and the chapel is to    
 close in September 1985.
