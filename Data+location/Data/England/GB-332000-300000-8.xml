OUR DOMESDAY WALK                      
Our route was a track from Stiperstones
to Hope Valley passing through Hogstow,
Lower Santley,Venus Bank to Fox Farm.We
set off at 6.30 pm on a fine muggy     
evening 24July 1985.Our first find was 
a purple spotted orchid,found amongst  
the grass along a track at Lower       
Santley,also near a covered wall 50    
yards from Lower Santley in a wet      
meadow we found Ragged Robin.Three     
Herons were roosting in dead Elms in   
the centre of the meadow a lovely      
sight.In all 100 species of wild       
flowers were recorded, together with   
musrooms and other fungi.The trees of  
the area include Beech,Field           
Maple,Oak,Sloe,Elder,Ash,Silver Birch  
and Mountain Ash.The track has a       
diversity of growing conditions for    
wild plants wet meadows to pasture land</content>
