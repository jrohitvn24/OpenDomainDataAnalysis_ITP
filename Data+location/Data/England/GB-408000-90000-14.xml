		<content> In Iford many years ago there was no  
 village, it was called Iford or Iver  
 as it was then well known as a fording
 place over the River Stour,the ford   
 with the little 'eyelets' or          
 'islands'. It was the ford nearest to 
 the sea,fordable on horseback,or even 
 by wading a dry season.               
                                       
 At the end of the 17th Centry ,many   
 walled ,thatched cottages were built  
 at Iford ,but the notable event was   
 the erection of two fine mansions,    
 Stourfield House and Iford House.
