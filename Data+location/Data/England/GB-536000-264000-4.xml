		<title>04LONGSTANTON PARISH COUNCIL</title>
		<content>   The Parish Council in Longstanton   
 has nine members at present, each     
 elected by the Parishioners for a four
 year period. The monthly Council      
 meetings are open to the public, and  
 there is an annual Parish Meeting.    
   The Council's{main purpose}is to    
 identify the village's needs and to   
 represent them to the appropriate     
 authority. It maintains parish        
 amenities such as the bus shelters and
 the Recreation Ground. It raises money
 for this by levying an annual rate.{  
{Recent concerns}have included litter, 
 dogs fouling public areas, the removal
 of trees and access to Rights of Way. 
 Children's play equipment on the      
 Recreation Ground has needed attention
 recently, and vandalism there has been
 a problem. A new free Parish Guide has
 been produced and distributed.
