		<title>05COMPUTERS IN INDUSTRY</title>
		<content>{   Aegon}is a Dutch company based in  
 Edenbridge with 200 employees, 16 of  
 whom are computer operators working   
 from 8.00am until 5.00pm.They have one
 mainframe computer costing            
 Â£500,000 alone and it has 2000k of    
 memory.                               
    The company computer was bought    
 from ICL from where they get all there
 supplies. {Aegon}don't deal with life 
 assurance, but are concerned with much
 larger businesses such as shipping    
 companies and racehorse owners.       
    In the computer room they have an  
 air conditioner to keep the computer  
 room cool .The temperature should     
 always be right or else if it goes    
 over the computer will malfunction    
 and there could be a fire. If this    
 occurs a ventilating gas system will  
 extinguish the fire and automatically 
 turns the computer off..by Paul Jenner</content>
