		<title>05Edingale Church Building</title>
		<content>     The church building is dedicated  
to the Holy Trinity. Little is known of
the structure which existed before 1735
when the church was rebuilt of brick   
but a Saxon "light" was preserved in   
the Chancel wall. After further        
destruction by lightning,the present   
church was rebuilt on the original site
in 1881.                               
    It incorporates the Saxon window in
the vestry and was built in the Early  
English style at a cost of 1910 pounds.
A clock was added in 1884 and in 1975  
the tower had to be reconstructed      
because of gale damage.                
   When the bells were rehung in 1981  
one bell bore the date 1685. Records of
christenings, marriages and funerals   
date from 1575 and the churchwardens   
accounts begin in 1811.We no longer    
have a vicar to ourselves but are in a 
joint ministry with Harleston.         </content>
