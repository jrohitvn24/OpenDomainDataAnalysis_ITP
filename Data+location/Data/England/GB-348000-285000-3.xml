		<content>   Just off the B4368 up a quiet lane  
 you will find a small and very neat   
{methodist chapel.}A plaque above the  
 door says it was built in{1826.}      
   Inside we noticed a little font in  
 the window which was as big as a small
 mixing bowl.The chapel has 8 small    
 windows and a small pulpit with an    
 altar rail in front of it.The organ is
 a small pedal version.On the wall     
 there is a small brass plaque in      
 memory of Mr and Mrs Price and their  
 son who died in Palestine.            
   The chapel has a small house        
 underneath it where the Price family  
 used to live.                         
   There are now 13 members and the    
 services are at 6.30pm.There was a    
 christening held on 5th May 1985.
