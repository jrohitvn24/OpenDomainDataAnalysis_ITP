		<content>    There are many places for holiday  
 makers to stay; holiday camps, caravan
 sites, hotels, self catering and bed  
 and breakfast.                        
  { Warners}is a holiday camp built    
 before the war and at present being   
 greatly modernised. It has 272 brick  
 built chalets and can cater for about 
 1,500 people.                         
  {Blue Waters}was built in 1954.      
 There are 300 wooden chalets owned by 
 Ladbrokes. There is plenty of         
 entertainment but the people provide  
 their own food.                       
    At the moment they only open from  
 April to September, but they are      
 hoping to open for a longer period.   
    There are only two proper Hotels   
 left in Seaton, the rest having been  
 turned into old peoples homes.
