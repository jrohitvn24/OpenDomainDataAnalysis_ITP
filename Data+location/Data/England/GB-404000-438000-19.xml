		<title>19RYECROFT</title>
		<content>    Ryecroft is a hamlet comprising    
 approximately a dozen dwellings,  all 
 of which except two are{"listed       
{buildings". }Most are modernised or   
 converted{farm houses}or{quarry       
{workers' cottages.  }                 
    The name "Ryecroft" originated in  
 the area once being cultivated for rye
 which was evidently processed and     
 brewed for ale on behalf of the monks 
 of{Drax Abbey}which once held farming 
 rights in the area.                   
    There is no mains water supply in  
 the hamlet which is supplied by       
{natural spring water.} There is some  
 concern at present about the          
 re-opening of a local quarry which, it
 is thought, may disturb the water-    
 table and affect supply.  Two large   
 storage tanks can be seen on the      
 moorside.
