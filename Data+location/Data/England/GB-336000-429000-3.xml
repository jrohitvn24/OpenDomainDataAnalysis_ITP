     There are lots of different types 
of houses in the village of Wrea Green.
An example of new types of housing is  
an estate which is full of mock        
Georgian houses.   All these houses    
have bay windows and their bricks are  
red, dark brown or sandy in colour.    
                                       
     Around the village green are      
large detached houses, bungalows,      
cottages, and terraced houses.   There 
is also a farm overlooking the Green.  
Some of the class live on housing      
estates which contain semi-detached    
houses.   These have ten rooms and     
small gardens.                         
                                       
 One boy in the class lives in a large 
detached house built by his father.
