		<title>16       THE BOAT RACE</title>
		<content>  The stretch of the Thames in south   
 Chiswick has 5 boathouses and is used 
 for the Oxford and Cambridge Boat     
 Race. This starts at Putney and ends  
 opposite Watneys Brewery. At the end  
 of the race they cheer the losing team
 and throw the cox in the water. In the
 autumn they go out training one at a  
 time in sculls and they choose the    
 best crew from 50 people. These go out
 in a boat and train for 4 hours a day.
 They do 20 miles a day and 120 a week.
 They have to be able to lift 200      
 kilogram weights the first time and   
 they are very strong. The boats are   
 made of fibreglass and cost 10,000    
 pounds to buy. When they have races   
 they get very tired. They have one day
 off as well. The crew must think      
 together and must work together as a  
 team.
