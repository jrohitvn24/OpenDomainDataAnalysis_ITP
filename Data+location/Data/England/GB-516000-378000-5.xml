		<title>05ECOLOGY IN PANTON POLLUTION</title>
		<content> The farmland in {PANTON }is cultivated
 by six farmers, two of whom are non-  
 resident and four of whom are. There  
 is a significant difference in the    
 attitude of the residents to the      
 non-residents. The two non-residents  
 have removed most of the field hedges 
 and small spinneys being motivated    
 entirely by economic considerations.  
 The other four farmers are carrying   
 out hedge preservation, tree planting 
 and show  concern for preservation of 
 wild life. perennial problems include 
 crop-spraying, both by tractor and    
 aeroplane, and straw-burning. This    
 latter is now subject to a code super-
 vised by the local authority. The beck
 at{PANTON}is now showing signs of life
 after being polluted by a farmer using
 a pea spray. This destroyed all life  
 in the river for 9 miles. The culprit 
 was fined Â£2,OOO.                     </content>
