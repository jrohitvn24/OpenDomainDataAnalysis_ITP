		<content> Yesterday we all got up at 7.30 am.I  
 put on my swimming costumeand my      
 clothes over the top. Then we put the 
 dogs in the carand went to Houghton   
 Regis swimming pool. We swim there on 
 Sunday morning and Dad plays          
 badminton.I start at 8.45 and Emma    
 starts at 9.45. When I got out of the 
 pool Mum came in the changing rooms   
 and said that she was going to take   
 Sooty and Fred(the dogs) for a        
 walk.When I was dressed I watched Emma
 swimming,and had a packet of crisps.  
 We went home and Mum and I cooked     
 breakfast.We had eggs, fried bread,   
 tomatoes and bacon. Emma and I played 
 tennis and badminton.We went to watch 
 a cricket match in Markyate. This was 
 my family Sunday on 12th May 1985.
