		<title>08Forestry in Cannock Chase</title>
		<content>  In Cannock Chase the{original forest}
of birch, elder and oak has largely    
disappeared. This has been partly      
replaced by dense coniferous forest,   
planted by the {Forestry Commission.}  
  Planting started in 1923, and these  
trees have already been harvested.     
  The cycle from planting to harvest   
takes approximately 55 years. In this  
area we can see all the stages of      
cultivation, from preparation of the   
soil, to planting, weeding, thinning   
out and  felling of the trees.         
  There are some broad-leaved trees    
such as silver birch and oak which     
are used for landscaping.              
  Originally scots pine were the main  
type of trees that were planted. As    
these were felled they were replaced   
by corsican pine. These were able to   
give higher timber yields and offered  
more resistance to pests and disease.  </content>
