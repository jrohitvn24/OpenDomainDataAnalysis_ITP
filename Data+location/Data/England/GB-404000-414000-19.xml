		<title>19CLUBS:SLAITHWAITE BAND.</title>
		<content> In the days when there was no cinema  
 or radio,country people organized     
 their own entertainment and Brass Band
 playing was popular.Slaithwaite Band  
 was formed in 1892 and was originally 
 known as the Upper Slaithwaite Reed   
 and Brass Band.                       
 In 1925,the Band moved to its present 
 headquarters at Ing Head.In the 1930's
 the band was reaching its peak and won
 the British Championships at Belle Vue
 in 1938.They have also celebrated     
 three Grand Shield victories in 1905, 
 1933 and 1962.                        
 The Junior Section was formed in 1962.
 At present they are 25-strong and play
 at local events in and around the     
 Colne Valley.The Senior Band is going 
 through a transitional period at the  
 moment but hopes are high that the    
 long tradition of fine Colne Valley   
 Brass Band playing will long continue.</content>
