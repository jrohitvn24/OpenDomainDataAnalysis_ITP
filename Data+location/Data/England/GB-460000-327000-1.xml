		<content> The block comprises a largely rural   
 area of S. Nottinghamshire to the     
 south of the Trent Valley (the        
 traditional dividing line between     
 southern and northern England). It    
 contains the small villages of{Wysall}
 (pop. approx. 250) and{Widmerpool}    
 (pop. &lt;200), each about 9 miles from  
 the city of Nottingham and within 3   
 miles of the large village of Key-    
 worth. In earlier times Wysall (Domes-
 day Wisoc; "A Hill of Plants") and    
 Widmerpool (Domesday Wimarspol) had   
 shops, tradesmen and a village school,
 but now neither has school, shops or  
 post office (Wysall's P.O. closed in  
 1984). The railway station at Widmer- 
 pool was outside the block, and is now
 closed. Only minor roads traverse the 
 block.
