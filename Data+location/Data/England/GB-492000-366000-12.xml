		<title>12TRAFFIC SURVEY</title>
		<content> The A46 trunk road runs through the   
 middle of North Hykeham effectively   
 dividing the town into two parts.     
 This was the old route of the Roman   
 Fosse Way,and runs from Bath to       
 Lincoln.The traffic along it can be   
 seen and heard from our school.       
 A class offirst year Juniors carried  
 out a survey of traffic travelling    
 into Lincoln on two days in Spring    
 1985 and in ten minutes over 120      
 vehicles were counted.                
  A new bypass is due to open in1986 to
 relieve  North Hykeham of much of this
 through traffic. We hope that this    
 busy road will be quieter then and    
 less traffic thundering along it will 
 make North Hykeham a better place in  
 which to live.
