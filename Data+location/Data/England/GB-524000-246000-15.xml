		<content>     The Goodwill Fund is a group of   
 people who for several years have     
 organised fundraising events in the   
 village. On the first Saturday in     
 September a large fete is held in the 
 meadow next to the Chequers public    
 house. Troughout the year the Goodwill
 Fund organises other events. All funds
 go to help the villages of            
 Wrestlingworth, Tadlow, Eyeworth and  
 Cockayne Hately. These are just some  
 of the ways. Anyone ill receives a    
 gift; any villager in hospital        
 receives a gift; help is given with   
 visiting the sick; the children       
 receive a gift and Senior Citizens    
 receive a parcel at Christmas time;   
 donations are made to other deserving 
 village causes.
