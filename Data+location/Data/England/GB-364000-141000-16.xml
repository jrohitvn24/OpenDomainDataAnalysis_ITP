		<title>16FARMING.(TWO)</title>
		<content>    On every farm in our area there are
 at least two{tractors.}The most is    
 five whilst the commonest make is     
{Massey-Ferguson.}Every{dairy farm}has}
 a{milking parlour}where the cows are  
 milked up to 24 at a time. Then they  
 have{grass-cutters, balers, trailers, 
{muck}or{slurry spreaders.}Some of the 
 farms have their own{combine-harvester
 for their{grain crops}and{slurry      
{tanks.}On most farms only the family  
 works on it, but on some of them there
 are up to 4 people working on them. At
{hay}making time friends sometimes help
 and they are given beer, cider or     
 money. At{silage}time the biggest     
 farms hire{contractors}to help the    
 because the machinery and equipment is
 so expensive and the work has to be   
 done so quickly once the weather is   
 right.
