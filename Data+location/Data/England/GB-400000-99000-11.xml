		<title>11A COLEHILL GIRL'S DAY.</title>
		<content> I get up at quarter past seven in the 
 morning and have a wash and get ready 
 for school, then I have my breakfast  
 of cereal, toast and milk. I walk to  
 school nearly every day. School starts
 at 8.55.a.m. On a Friday morning we   
 have a spelling and tables test and   
 then we have P.E. We put out apparatus
 and then choose what we want to have a
 go on first. Next we have our assembly
 and then it is playtime. I play with  
 my friends Debra, Lisa and Caroline.  
 After play we have handwriting and we 
 write out a poem.At midday we have    
 lunch and in the afternoon we choose a
 game to play indoors. We have another 
 playtime at 2.30.p.m.and go home at   
 3.20.p.m. I have my tea and watch     
 television before I go to bed.
