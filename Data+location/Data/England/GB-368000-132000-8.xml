		<title>08King's School - History.</title>
		<content>  The  {King's School}is an independent
 foundation and is predominantly a     
 boarding school.  It was founded in   
 1519 by Richard Fitzjames, Chief      
 Justice of England, and John Edmunds, 
 D.D., Chancellor of St. Paul's.  On   
 the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 
 1538, the school lands lapsed to the  
 crown.  However, in response to a     
 petition, King Edward VI restored the 
 endowment on 1 May 1550, and allowed a
 crown to be incorporated into the     
 School crest, which also depicts the  
 Dolphin, taken from the crest of the  
 Fitzjames family.  This century, there
 has been an expansion in all          
 departments of school life, notably   
 the founding of three  new boarding   
 houses.  Within the last fifteen      
 years, a number of new buildings      
 have been constructed.
