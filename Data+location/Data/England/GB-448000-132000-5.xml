		<content> The Worthies lie along the course of  
 King's Worthy, Abbot's Worthy, Martyr 
 Worthy and Easton villages.{The River 
{Itchen}winds and curves its way       
 through a valley of woods and water   
 meadows.It is a small river less than 
 30 miles long from the tidal estuary  
 at Southampton to the source. It is   
 renowned for trout fishing and the    
 wildlife along the banks. Mr Holloway,
 the water bailiff, tells stories of a 
 pair of breeding otters but will not  
 disclose their holt. The river is     
 spring fed. Extensive areas of the    
 river at Martyr Worthy were converted 
 to{water meadows.}Water was led into  
 carriers and allowed to overflow to   
 the drains. Farmers could divert water
 on to grass during the winter to      
 provide early grazing for sheep.Much  
 of the system can still be seen.
