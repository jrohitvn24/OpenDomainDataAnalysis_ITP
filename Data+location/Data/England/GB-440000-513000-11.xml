		<title>11     THE THIRD WORLD</title>
		<content> If there's poor in the world          
 Should we help?                       
 If there's starving in the world      
 Should we help?                       
 If there's dying and some sadness     
 It is really, really madness          
 Not to give them gladness             
 Should we help?                       
                                       
 We can do it by our giving,           
 We should help.                       
 We can do it by our praying,          
 We should help.                       
 We did it with Geldorf,               
 And yet they still aren't well off.   
 Should we help them? Should we help   
                                 them? 
 YES WE SHOULD!!!                      
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
