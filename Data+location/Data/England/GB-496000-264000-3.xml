		<title>03 The People of Rushden</title>
		<content>  We did a survey asking people        
questions, so we could find out how    
people live in Rushden. We found that  
many houses were old; over 70 years. A 
lot of people seemed to have lived in  
Rushden for a long time.               
  Most people preferred shopping in    
Rushden, though they visited Bedford,  
Wellingborough and Northampton, at     
times; few used Kettering. They liked  
Rushden because they found it cheaper  
and nearer.                            
  A lot of people used the corner shops
because they were convenient, although 
expensive; so we visited the shops to  
find out about them. Nearly all opened 
7 days a week, most between 7.00 a.m.  
and 8.00 p.m., some till 10.00 p.m.    
with 2-5 assistants. The slackest time 
of the day was from 1.30 p.m. - 3.00   
p.m. Most people that visited the shops
were known by the the shop owner.      </content>
