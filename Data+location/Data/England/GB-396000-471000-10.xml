		<title>10TOURISM IN KETTLEWELL</title>
		<content>   Tourism is a growth industry and    
 very important to the economy of the  
 area as agriculture has become less   
 labour intensive.  Many cottages are  
 now used as second homes for town     
 dwellers or as holiday lets.   The    
 hotels and guest houses depend on     
 tourists as do the local shops.  As   
 the demand for holiday cottages grows 
 the price of houses remains inflated. 
 Sadly this sometimes means that local 
 youngsters have to move away to afford
 their first homes.  However, tourism  
 does provide work for a large number  
 of people and in a village whose main 
 industry was once lead mining the     
 village is fortunate in that its      
 location is attractive to visitors.   
 The area provides scenic interest for 
 many activities, such as walking,     
 climbing, fishing and potholing,      
 canoeing and painting.                </content>
