		<content>  Tilehurst,a rapidly growing suberb of
 Reading built on the hill between the 
 valley of the Thames on the north side
 of the Kennet on the south side.      
  The roads leading up into Tilehurst  
 are steep until they reach the plateau
 at the top.At the highest point is a  
 large white water tower which acts as 
 a landmark for miles around.The       
 eastern sector consits of older       
 private and council housing.As you    
 move westwards this becomes 1960's    
 private housing and in recent years   
 there has been a huge explosion of new
 buildings covering many remaining     
 woods and fields,smothering the old   
 core village settlements of Tilehurst 
 and Purley.
