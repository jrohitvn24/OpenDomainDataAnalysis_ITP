		<content>   The focal point for social          
 activities in Huntley is the Village  
 Hall.It is run by a committee of      
 nineteen people.                      
   The hall is used by many different  
 groups and clubs such as karate,      
 Playgroup,Football,Mothers'Union,     
 Thursday Group,Autumn Club and Women's
 Institute.                            
   There is plenty of entertainment    
 such as table tennis,snooker,table    
 football,darts and lots more.         
   The committee looks after the hall  
 and car park,but not the adjoining    
 playing fields.The thing that brings  
 in the most money is the bar.
