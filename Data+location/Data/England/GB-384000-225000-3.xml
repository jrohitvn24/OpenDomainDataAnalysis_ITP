		<title>03         THE LEIGH</title>
		<content>                                       
 The Leigh was mentioned in the first  
 Domesday Book as LALEGE, one hide in  
 extent, belonging to the Priory of    
 Deerhurst, 4 kilometres to the north. 
 The first mention of the church was in
 1125, the oldest part remaining being 
 a side chapel in the Early English    
 style. The church was originally      
 called St James but changed its name  
 at some time to St Catherines.        
 The Leigh is a very small quiet       
 village although it is only a         
 kilometre from the A.38 main road.    
 The manor house called Leigh Court    
 together with the church are separated
 by several fields from the rest of the
 village. There are still remains of a 
 moat there.
