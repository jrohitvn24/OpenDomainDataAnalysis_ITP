		<content>  Bickham House, owned by the Lopes    
 family, was built approximately 100   
 years ago on the sight of an earlier  
 'William and Mary' house of the 'Gill'
 family, bankers from Plymouth. It is  
 believed that William Morris was      
 involved in the building of the       
 property. There remains a window in   
 the house designed by this man.       
  After the war the present Lord       
 Roborough's father bought the property
 rather than see the area spoilt by    
 development although, at that time, he
 had no intention of living there as   
 Roborough House was the 'dower' house.
  The estate and house continue to be  
 passed down through the family. The   
 expense and hardwork of maintaining   
 the house is shared by the whole      
 family. The house is occupied by Lord 
 Roborough's son the Rt Hon' Henry     
 Lopes his wife and family.            </content>
