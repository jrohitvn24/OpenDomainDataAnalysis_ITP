		<content> A Horam general practioner holds a    
 weekly afternoon clinic for those who 
 cannot drive the 5 miles to Horam.    
 Other surgeries are at Punnetts Town  
 and Heathfield all of which have      
 associated health visitors who call as
 required. Heathfield has the nearest  
 chemist shops but some prefer to go to
 Herstmonceux with its small friendly  
 pharmacy. A monthly chiropody clinic  
 is held in the village hall for Â£3 a  
 session. People have to travel 10-20  
 miles to visit hospitals in Heathfield
 Eastbourne or Tunbridge Wells. There  
 is a Victorian psychiatric hospital at
 Hellingly. Community physio- and      
 occupational therapy is provided for  
 the elderly and homebound with        
 transport provided by ambulance or    
 car if required. Dental surgeries are 
 found in Hailsham and Heathfield but  
 many patients choose to go further.   </content>
