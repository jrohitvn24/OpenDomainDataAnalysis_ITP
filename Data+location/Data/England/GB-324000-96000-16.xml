		<title>16RIVER AXE AND RIVER YARTY</title>
		<content> Two rivers flow through our area.     
 The larger river is the Axe, and the  
 other river is called the Yarty.  Both
 are fairly small rivers, although they
 can become swollen after heavy rain   
 and can cause flooding of the fields  
 either side of their banks.           
 The Yarty runs into the Axe near the  
 end of its run, almost into the       
 estuary of the Axe.                   
 There are mud flats, which are tidal  
 at the estuary, and these are         
 frequented by many different types of 
 birds.  The estuary is a popular place
 with birdwatchers.                    
 Sometimes we see herons and swans in  
 the fields by the rivers when we are  
 on our way to visit other schools.
