The local farms produce arable         
crops,especially wheat and barley.  An 
increasing amount of grass is grown.   
In 1976 a company called Agridry moved 
to the disused Worminghall airfield and
set up a factory for drying grass and  
making it into pellets for animal feed.
Approximately twenty people are        
employed.  The national company, Dean's
Egg Farms has two farms in this block. 
Coldstream and Joshua Farms are run as 
ring farms, with day old chicks being  
kept for eighteen weeks, until they are
old enough to lay.  Then they are sent 
to the laying farms, which in this     
case, are in the Standlake area.  Eggs 
are supplied to the Sainsbury and      
Waitrose supermarkets.  Local farmers  
collect the waste, free, for manure.
