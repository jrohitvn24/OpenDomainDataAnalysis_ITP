		<title>02RELIGION MOSQUE CUSTOMS</title>
		<content>Before I go to the mosque I wash my    
hands and face then put on my scarf and
go to the mosque with my sister and    
brother.  When I get there I must take 
off my shoes. When the children need   
help they put up their hand and then I 
go to them and tell them the word they 
do not know and help them with their   
alphabet. When I have told some of the 
children I go and get my Korne and     
first I have to kiss the Korne three   
times and then the other girl gets up .
When she has read then I take the cover
off and begin to read.    The Koran has
30 parts to it and it tells you the    
messages of God.  Some times I read    
about 7 or 8 pages.  The mosque is in  
Westbourne Road Luton and some times   
classes come from different schools.   
The mosque starts at 4o'clock for      
children and ends at 6 o'clock.
