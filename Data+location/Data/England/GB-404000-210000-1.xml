		<content>    Chedworth is a small,quiet village.
 the buildings are scattered,some are  
 very old and some are still being     
 built.The Romans lived here there was 
 a villa opposite our church. The      
 church is Norman and so probably is   
 the very fine Manor.Most of the       
 cottages are built with cotswold stone
 and have beautiful gardens.           
   Many activities take place for young
 and old.This is a community where     
 people like to join in and to help    
 others.There are two flower           
 shows,an amateur drama group,a parents
 association,football and cricket clubs
 ,a W.I. and several church groups.In  
 the spring there is an Easter Event   
 with many stalls in the modern village
 hall.At Christmas there is carol      
 singing at the pub.We have fetes,     
 rummage,coffee mornings and charity   
 lunches and a harvest supper.         </content>
