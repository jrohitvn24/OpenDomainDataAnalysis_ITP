		<content> Shipbourne School's Funday is an      
 annual event to raise money for the   
 P.T.A. Every family helps to arrange  
 their stalls or games.These are some  
 of the stalls:toys,handicraft,white   
 elephant,plants,tombola and lucky dip 
 but there are many more.Funday starts 
 at 2.00 p.m.but many people come to   
 prepare in the morning,and finishes at
 5.00 p.m. If you are very hot you can 
 go into the stocks and get soaked with
 wet sponges that will definitely cool 
 you off.This year the children's      
 tombola was fantastic with a football 
 and all sorts of super things.The day 
 ended with a lighthearted tug of war  
 which involes as many adults and      
 children as possible,everyone had to  
 be quite strong to give an extremely  
 good tug.On an enjoyable afternoon,we 
 managed to raise Â£1,000.    Simon
