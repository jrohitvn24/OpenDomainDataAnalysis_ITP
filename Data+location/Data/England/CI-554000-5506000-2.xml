		<title>02The Policing of Alderney I</title>
		<content>  This information was got from        
 P.C.Richardson,the only local         
 policeman on Alderney.In the winter   
 one sergeant and one constable come   
 over from Guernsey for two week       
 spells.In the summer one constable,one
 sergeant and one detective constable  
 come over.The sergeants and the       
 constables are responsible for the day
 to day policing of Alderney.The       
 Detective Constable is involved in the
 comings and goings at the Harbour and 
 Airfield.He is known as the "Port     
 Watch".They have a record book of lost
 and found property - which amounts to 
 about 280 items in a single year.They 
 also have a file of robberies.All     
 crimes are kept on a micro-film filing
 system in Guernsey.Our police station 
 has two prison cells.
