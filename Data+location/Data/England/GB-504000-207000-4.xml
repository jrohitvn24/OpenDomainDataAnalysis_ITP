		<title>04EAST-WEST LINK ROAD, HEMEL</title>
		<content> The{East-West link road}was opened in 
 January 1984, connecting the Leighton 
 Buzzard Road with the Redbourn Road   
 and providing access to Grovehill and 
 Maylands Avenue Industrial Estate.    
 This road has decreased congestion in 
 the Town Centre and Queensway, and    
 Piccotts End Lane, a single track, is 
 closed to traffic. Grovehill parents  
 are concerned about{road safety,}due  
 to the increased flow and speed of    
 traffic, poor fencing separating the  
 road from housing estates and the     
 reluctance of children to use         
 underpasses. The present{speed limit  
 on the new road is 30 mph but is to be
 raised to 50 mph. The parents have    
 undertaken several{traffic census,    
 showing a marked increase in vehicles 
 passing through Grovehill. The county 
 will not provide crossings etc as     
 underpasses already exist.            </content>
