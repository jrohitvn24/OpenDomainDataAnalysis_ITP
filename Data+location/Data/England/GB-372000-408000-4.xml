		<content>  Thomas Ryder established in 1865     
 making textile rollers supplying the  
 world. In 1928 began to make machine  
 tools for car manufacturers. A rapid  
 expansion in car manufacture in 1950  
 resulted in Ryder's expansion. For 20 
 years this family business was        
 successful until cash flow problems   
 began and there was a dramatic        
 increase in Japanese car imports.     
 Vauxhall and British Leyland reduced  
 their orders to Ryder's who were taken
 over by an American company in 1981.  
 The company finally ceased production,
 moved to Derby and left hundreds of   
 local men unemployed. A small company 
 set up in one of the buildings is now 
 employing a previous floor manager as 
 a floor sweeper.
