		<content>      When it is time to go back to    
 school I go and call for my friends.  
 When I get back to school I play until
 the bell goes. When we get back into  
 school we go to drama. At drama we    
 play games and make up little plays.  
 After that we go to music; we sing a  
 lot of songs and tape them. After     
 music it is time for playtime and we  
 go out to play. When we come in from  
 play we carry on with our work and    
 then we have a story. Then after half 
 an hour the bell goes for home time. I
 walk home on my own and when I get    
 home I have my tea and then I watch   
 childrens I.T.V., then go out to play 
 with my friend Alison. We play hide   
 and seek and sometimes we play in my  
 bedroom. At 8 p.m. I go in and have my
 supper and then I go and have a bath; 
 after which I watch television until 9
 p.m. then I go to bed.                </content>
