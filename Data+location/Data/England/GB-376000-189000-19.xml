		<content>{The Walk to Tresham.}We went through  
 fields and valleys. We walked to      
 Alderley and Rose Hill School. After  
 that we started off to go to Tresham. 
 We went up big hills and little hills.
 We collected many wild flowers and    
 twigs of trees. We got to this big    
 hill and there was corn, it was green.
 When we could see Tresham we all ran  
 up to be the first. We delivered      
 questionnaires to all the houses      
 there. We walked back through the     
 fields along part of the Cotswold Way.
 There were sheep watching us go by.   
 There were muddy bits and I got stuck 
 in the mud.                           
 Some of the crops we saw were barley, 
 maize, wheat and grass.               
 Some trees were sycamore, elder, ash, 
 horse chestnut, maple, hawthorn, oak, 
 beech, silver birch, lime, yew, and   
 larch.                                </content>
