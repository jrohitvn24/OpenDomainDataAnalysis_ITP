		<title>06EVENTS IN NEW MILLS/DISLEY</title>
		<content> Every year New Mills has a fun run    
 which takes place in the early        
 evening, just outside school.   It is 
 a one mile race and it has lots of    
 hills to climb, so it is a hard race. 
 People wear all sorts of bright       
 costumes and everyone enjoys it.      
 It sometimes rains but still          
 everyone is cheerful.    The best     
 place to watch is at the school,      
 people sit on the roof.    It is an   
 annual event and most people watch.   
    Every year Disley has a procession 
 where people dress up and New Mills   
 band plays marches.  People decorate  
 lorries which have tableaux instead of
 goods.    There are stalls at the back
 of the Ram's Head with games and a    
 coconut shy.    Later Morris dancers  
 come and amuse the tired customers.
