		<title>09SATURDAY FOR KATIE LODSWORTH</title>
		<content>                                       
   On Saturday morning I climbed out of
 bed,got dressed and had my breakfast. 
 Then mummy drove my brother Timothy   
 and me to Guildford for a special     
 shopping expedition. First we bought  
 some grapes and cherries. Then mummy  
 bought me two pairs of shoes and a    
 dress.                                
      Then we arrived at the Pet Shop. 
 We chose our guinea pigs and the lady 
 put them into a special pet box. I    
 carried the box all the way to the car
 and mummy drove us home to Lodsworth. 
 When we had eaten lunch I got my      
 guinea pig out of his box. I enjoyed  
 playing with him.                     
      After a while I put him back and 
 went to watch television. Mum called  
 me for my supper. After supper I      
 watched television for a long time.
