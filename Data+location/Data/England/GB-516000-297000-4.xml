		<content>  People have been settling in and     
 around the city  for the past 6000    
 years. After the stone age came Roman 
 farmers and then the Anglo-Saxons.    
                                       
  A Saxon monastery was founded 1300   
 years ago and this became the         
 cathedral on its dissolution during   
 the reign of Henry VIII.              
                                       
  The growth of the city was slow until
 136 years ago when the railways came  
 and plunged Peterborough into its     
 first expansion and made the city an  
 engineering centre.                   
                                       
  Now, in 1985, the city is just coming
 to the end of its second expansion.   
 This time it has been a planned growth
 with careful attention to industry,   
 employment, housing and leisure.
