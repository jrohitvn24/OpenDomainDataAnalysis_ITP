		<title>10ARABLE FARM, EAST BARKWITH</title>
		<content>    One {arable}farm fell completely   
 within this block, but it is worked   
 as part of a unit consisting of       
 several farms, scattered over a wide  
 area. Crops are rotated on a four-year
 cycle, to prevent disease. This farm  
 covers 162 acres, of which half was   
 under {wheat} in 1985. A quarter was  
 under {oil-seed rape}and the remainder
 carried{barley, beans and potatoes.}  
 The yard occupied one and a half      
 acres, and contained sheds with a     
 corn-drier and shelter for the        
 tractors, combine-harvesters and rape 
 swathers.  The farmer also runs a     
 land-drainage firm, which employs up  
 to ten men when they are busy. Some of
 his yard is occupied by rolls of      
 plastic drainage piping of different  
 diameters and colours, waiting to be  
 installed.                            
   His only livestock is one dog.      </content>
