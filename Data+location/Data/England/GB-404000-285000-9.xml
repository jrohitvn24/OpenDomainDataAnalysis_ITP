		<content>The majority of those asked said :     
The #1 note should be saved.Violence   
shown on TV is harmful.Policies of the 
present government are not the right   
ones at this time.Cannabis should not  
be legalised.Punk fashion is light-    
hearted/agressive.The police are not   
"wonderful" anymore.There are not      
sufficient educational opportunities   
for children today.High rise flats are 
not the answer to today's housing      
problems.We,as a nation,are becoming   
more sports conscious-but divided      
between being fiercely  competitive and
fun.The majority of children have too  
much pocket money.Space travel is an   
unnecessary expense.The Royal Family is
an asset to the nation.Trade Union     
practices not attuned to present       
requirements.Modern technology will    
only improve the lot of the few who    
understand it.                         </content>
