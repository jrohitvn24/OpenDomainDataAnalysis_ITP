		<content>{"ON SATURDAY" by Paul Hartley (aged 9)
                                       
 There is no school on a Saturday so I 
 get up at about 9.15 a.m. I have my   
 breakfast which is usually "Special   
 'K'" and get ready for football       
 practice with Cubs. We reach Storth   
 Playing Fields at about 10.00 and pick
 two teams. At half-time we have either
 coffe, tea or orange juice. When      
 football is over I go home and have a 
 bath. At 2.00 my mother takes Simon,  
 my older brother, and me to the       
 swimming baths at Carnforth High      
 School so that I can train. At 4.15 I 
 get out and Simon begins to train     
 until 5.30.  At 6.00 we get home again
 and watch television until tea is     
 ready to eat. Then we watch television
 again until it is time to go to bed at
 9.30 p.m.                             
                                       </content>
