		<title>14 Rushden Town Football Club</title>
		<content>  Rushden play in the Southern League, 
Midland Division playing 38 games a    
season. They are also in the F.A. Cup, 
F.A. Vase and County Senior Cup. The   
reserves play in their own league and  
United Counties Cup. They also run a   
youth team. The bar pays most costs.   
  When a match is to be played they    
send a letter to the opposing team with
details of the match. The visiting team
sends Rushden a team list to print in  
the programmes.                        
  On match day the groundsman lines the
pitch and puts out the corner flags and
nets. It costs a pound for adults and  
50p for children to watch a match      
  Two days after the Bradford fire (May
1985) the fire brigade came to inspect 
the stand. It was found unsafe and     
needed changes as it was wood: exits   
are to be made larger; seating reduced 
to 250 and rubbish underneath cleared. </content>
