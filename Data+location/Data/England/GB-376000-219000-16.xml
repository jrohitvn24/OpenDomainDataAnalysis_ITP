		<title>16A TEENAGER'S IMPRESSION</title>
		<content>   Upon entering this block from the   
 city of Gloucester,the thing which I  
 immediately noticed was the lack of   
 housing-most of the area being arable 
 crop land.There are only 2 settlements
 in the area and a few farm houses.    
  {Highnam}seems to be a medium sized  
 village consisting mainly of a large  
 estate of recently built houses.The   
 majority of inhabitants are commuters 
 working in and around Gloucester.     
  {Tibberton},on the other hand,is a   
 village of mostly old houses.Most of  
 the population seem to be middle aged 
 and retired couples.                  
   The major land use in the block is  
 arable farming,especially cereals and 
 oil-seed rape.                        
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
