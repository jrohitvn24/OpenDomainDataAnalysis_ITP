		<title>11HELSTON INDUSTRIAL ESTATE(1)</title>
		<content>{Helston's Industrial Estate}lies on   
 the north west outskirts of the town, 
 at Water-ma-Trout. In all about 300   
 people work there.                    
     Some firms moved to the estate    
 from smaller premises in Helston. Most
 firms are growing concerns and many   
 send their manufactured goods all over
 the world.                            
     The firm of Fred Rees has been    
 operating on the Estate for 19 years. 
 The most recent firm to move there is 
 Cresta Bakers who moved there only 9  
 months ago. On the estate it is       
 possible to buy anything from sausages
 to jeans, bedroom fitments or         
 tractors. There is only one empty     
 building on the site but no doubt the 
 premises will be occupied by yet      
 another thriving business.
