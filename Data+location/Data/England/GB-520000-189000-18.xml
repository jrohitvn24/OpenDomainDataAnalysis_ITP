  In contrast the{side streets}are     
 rather quiet,with only a few people   
 walking about during the day,and most 
 of these seem to be{elderly people.}  
 The other half of the area is open{   
{green space.}There is a fairly large{ 
{park}with swings and a tennis court.  
{Copthall Stadium}and{sports ground}   
 cover a large area,and provide an     
 important{recreational}facility.      
 Parallel to the stadium is a private  
 golf course with beautiful            
 landscaping,and a club house.Adjacent 
 to that there are{allotment gardens.} 
 The{Hendon Cemetery}and{crematorium}  
 with its abundance of flowers,is      
 nearby.                               
   There are no tall buildings,only the
 gas works.The neighbourhood is very   
 pleasant and bright.
