		<title>07THE OAK TREE LIGHTS.</title>
		<content> On the 20th of July a serious accident
 claimed the life of Mrs Joan Usher.   
 It took place on a very dangerous'T'  
 junction where Berry Hill Lane meets  
 with the A617.This was only  one of a 
 series of serious accidents.          
 In October 1984 traffic lights were   
 put up to make the junction safer.    
 Since the traffic lights have been put
 up it has made the junction safer.    
                                  We   
 did a survey to see how many people   
 travel to school in 1P on Southwell   
 Road.Eight out of twenty-one people   
 travel along there everyday.
