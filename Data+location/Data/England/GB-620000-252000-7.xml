		<title>07THE POST OFFICE, CLOPTON</title>
		<content> The Post Office at Clopton had been   
 closed for many years until about 3   
 years ago when it was re-opened by a  
 family who own a small vineyard in the
 village. They occupy a room in the    
 house and have all the facilities of a
 small Post Office. This is used mainly
 by the younger families and pensioners
 in the village.
