		<title>09    A YEAR OF FARMING</title>
		<content>    January is the time when most cows 
 start calving.April is the start of   
 lambing. By May most lambing has      
 finished.The sheep that have lambs for
 the first time are called hogs.Most   
 farmers start to make silage in June. 
 June &amp; July sees the end of most      
 calving.August is the start of        
 harvest.                              
   The corn is led to Jameson's Mill to
 make into cattle feeds. In November we
 open the silage pit and feed it to the
 cows and the hay to the calves through
 the Winter.                           
    Farms around Masham grow various   
 crops including wheat,barley,potatoes,
 oil seed rape and cale.All the stock  
 farmers have grass land.Farmers around
 Masham hire contractors to help out in
 the busy months.The most common piece 
 of machinery hired is the Combine     
 Harvester.                            </content>
