		<content> This coastal area is on the southern  
 shore of the Bristol Channel taking in
 the northern region of the parish of  
 Kewstoke and touching Wick St         
 Lawrence.Although it fringes on the   
 holiday resort of Sand Bay and is     
 close to Weston-S-Mare, much of the   
 land is farmed with part of it owned  
 by the National Trust.                
 The hilly peninsula of Sand Point is  
 contrasted by the plain to its south  
 and east which is well drained low    
 lying farmland.The fields are used    
 mainly for grazing and growing grass  
 for hay or silage.                    
 The area is rich in wildlife with an  
 extensive saltmarsh and nature        
 reserve.                              
 The most interesting of the very few  
 buildings in this rural area is an    
 ancient priory.
