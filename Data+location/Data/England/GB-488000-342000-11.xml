		<content> There is one church in each of the two
 villages.  All Saints at Hougham and  
 St. Mary's at Marston.  They are both 
 Church of England.                    
 The churches normally hold wervices on
 alternate Sundays.  At the moment they
 are without pastoral representation   
 since the death of the rector.  The   
 regular churchgoers number about 5.   
 Flowers are arranged in the churches  
 by a small group of ladies in the     
 villages, not necessarily church going
 members.                              
 A few villagers attend the Parish     
 Church in Grantham.                   
 Recently there have been a few        
 burglaries at local churches and      
 objects of antiquity have been stolen.
 Hougham Church is in the process of   
 raising money to repair the church    
 roof at an estimated cost of Â£6,000.  
 There are funerals, weddings, baptisms</content>
