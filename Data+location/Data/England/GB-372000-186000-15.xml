 SCHOOL",FOUNDED BY ALEXANDER HOSEA'S  
 BEQUEST IN 1684.ORIGINALLY A SCHOOL   
 FOR 30POOR BOYS OF WICKWAR IT IS NOW A
 C.P.SCHOOL.THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL    
 SCHOOLS IN WICKWAR;A GIRLS SCHOOL,AND 
 AN INFANTS SCHOOL.BOTH NO LONGER EXIST
 BUT THE BUILDINGS ARE USED FOR OTHER  
 PURPOSES.WITH AN AREA SCHEDULED FOR
