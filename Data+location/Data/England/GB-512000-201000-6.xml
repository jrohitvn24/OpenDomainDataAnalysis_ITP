		<content>In Bricket Wood there is a railway     
station;the line runs between Watford  
Junction and St Albans Abbey.It was    
built for steam  trains,carrying       
passengers and it also carried coal    
for the gas works in St Albans. On     
Sundays a lot of Sunday School         
outings travelled   to Bricket Wood    
for picnics and walks in the           
woods.Nowadays,there is a half-hourly  
diesel drawn passenger train,mainly    
taking commuters to and from Euston via
Watford.                               
Commuters also use the nearby M1 to    
travel to London by car.               
The last stretch of the M 25 is now    
being built,which,with M1,will give the
area excellent road links with the     
whole country.
