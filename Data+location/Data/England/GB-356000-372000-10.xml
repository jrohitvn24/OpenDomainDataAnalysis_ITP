		<title>10Crowton Post Office</title>
		<content>  The Post Office and shop were built  
 in Crowton 32 years ago, but there was
 originally a shop by the stream and   
 the public house.  The shop sells most
 goods like sweets, cooked meats,      
 coffee, tea and most other foods.  The
 most expensive goods are cigarettes.  
  The shop opens from 06.00 hrs. until 
 17.00 hrs.  Bread and newspapers are  
 delivered each morning.  The Daily    
 Mail is the most popular newspaper.   
 Newspapers are not delivered from the 
 shop.  People come to the shop for    
 them.                                 
  The Post Office opens at 09.00 hrs.  
 The postman comes twice a day and     
 collects letters and parcels.  Most   
 people use the Post Office for stamps,
 pensions and unemployment benefits.   
  Many people do their food shopping at
 Northwich and use the village shop for
 odd items.                            </content>
