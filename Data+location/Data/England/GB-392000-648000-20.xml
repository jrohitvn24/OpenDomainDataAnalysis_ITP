		<title>20Union Chain Bridge</title>
		<content> a Until 1883 tolls were charged for   
 crossing the Union Chain Bridge.The   
 toll-keepers house  built at the base 
 of the English Tower was demolished in
 1955,but the toll house of the Berwick
 -shire Turnpike Trust still stands    
 near the Scottish end of the bridge.  
 Under Scottish law toll-houses could  
 sell liquor and marriages could take  
 place there.It aquired unwelcome notor
 -iety, but whisky drinking ceased in  
 1854 and marriages in 1857.           
 The cost of builing the bridge in 1880
 was estimated at Â£7700 which included 
 a gratuity to Capt. Brown. In 1973 a  
 10 year repair programme was commenced
 and the bridge will now remain the    
 fine looking structure built so long  
 ago and will only require minimal main
 -tenance  for the next 50 years. It is
 now maintained by The Tweed Bridge    
 Trust financed by local authorities.  </content>
