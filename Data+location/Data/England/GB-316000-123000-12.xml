		<title>12History of Pontispool Farm</title>
		<content>   Pontispool farm is 400 years old and
 is leased to a Mr. Whittle who has    
 been on the farm for 40 years.  The   
 actual owner is a Major Mitford-Slade 
 who lives in Monty's Court nearby.    
   Up the road from the farm you pass  
 an old school, built in the mid-      
 nineteenth century by Mrs Slade, an   
 ancestor of the Major.  As she lived  
 in Wey House a couple of kilometres   
 away, she had a path built to the     
 school which passes through the farm. 
 Remnants of this walk, including a    
 footbridge still exist on the farm.   
   The school was built with money from
 the Great Western Railway who built   
 over a cottage nearby. According to   
 Mr. Whittle the G.W.R. line was closed
 in 1955. Many of the buildings on the 
 farm incorporate ex-sleepers in their 
 structure.  An old well on the farm is
 said to be 500 years old.             </content>
