		<content> YOUTH UNEMPLOYMENT IS A PROBLEM WHERE 
 16 YR. OLD SCHOOL LEAVERS ARE JOBLESS.
 A YOUTH TRAINING SCHEME OF ONE YEAR IS
 GIVING WORK EXPERIENCE BUT AFTERWARDS 
 BORED JOBLESS TEENAGERS MEET IN KING'S
 SQUARE OR THE MARKET AREA FOR COMPANY.
 SOME FIND TROUBLE BY TAKING DRUGS OR  
 SNIFFING GLUE OR BECOMING DRUNK.      
 VANDALISM ESPECIALLY BREAKING WINDOWS 
 OCCURS AT NIGHT. AN INCREASE IN SINGLE
 PARENT FAMILIES IS CAUSING CONCERN.   
 THE D.H.S.S. GIVES SUPPLEMENTARY      
 BENEFIT TO THE LONG TERM UNEMPLOYED   
 AND THEIR DEPENDENTS. THE WELFARE OF  
 THE ELDERLY PEOPLE IS ENSURED BY      
 BUILDING BLOCKS OF SELF CONTAINED     
 FLATS TO REPLACE ALL SUBSTANDARD HOMES
 IN THE INNER CITY OR OLDER RESIDENTIAL
 AREAS,EACH BLOCK HAS A RESIDENT WARDEN
 TO CARE FOR THEM. THE W.R.V.S. MEALS  
 ON WHEELS SERVICE BRING DAILY HOT     
 MEALS TO INFIRM PENSIONERS.           </content>
