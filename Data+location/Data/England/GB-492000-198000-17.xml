		<content> I cycle about two miles to the shops. 
 Comics cost about twenty pence, a     
 computer magazine a pound, a bag of   
 potato crisps twelve pence and a      
 small carton of fruit juice twenty    
 five pence. On the way back I might   
 window shop for ten minutes or so,    
 then cycle home to read the comic and 
 magazine and consume the crisps and   
 fruit juice. On Saturday evenings I   
 sometimes play squash with my Dad or  
 brother. Dinner usually consists of   
 chips with either fish, beefburgers or
 sausages. I collect stamps, especially
 commemorative sets like fish, boats   
 insects, and British composers. I like
 drawing and painting. My brother's    
 girlfriend has passsed her art degree,
 so I can use her paint, inks and pens.
 My best sports are snooker, tennis,   
 squash, and swimming. I go to         
 Amersham Swimming Club twice a week.  </content>
