		<title>11PLANNING DILEMMA IN GOOLE</title>
		<content>  A large{flour mill}in Goole wanted   
 to expand its premises to make a{new  
{warehouse}to store and distribute a   
 new health food product. They         
 complained that the{council}were      
 taking too long to decide whether this
 could go ahead.                       
  The problem seems to have been that  
 the council were worried about the new
 parking spaces which would be needed  
 and the extra nuisance to people in   
 the area.                             
  The problem, we think, is that more  
 jobs are needed but the area has to be
 made as pleasant as possible for those
 who live there - and you can't please 
 everyone in situations like this!     
  Political{decisions}must be very     
 difficult to make when there are so   
 many different points of view to      
 consider.                             
                                       </content>
