		<title>04VISIT TO THE QUEEN'S LIBRARY</title>
		<content> by David,Bradley                      
 We looked into Queen Ann's Closet,a   
 tiny room in the library where news   
 of the Battle of Blenheim was given   
 to Queen Ann.As well as books the     
 library has a collection of priceless 
 water-colours by Leonardo da Vinci,   
 Raphael,Canaletto,on show to the      
 public and loaned for exhibitions     
 world-wide ;staff from the library    
 travel with them to ensure their care.
 A unique collection of papers of the  
 Royal Family is stored in archives in 
 the Round Tower;8-10 staff care for   
 it.The library is well used by Prince 
 Edward studying at Cambridge          
 University and by all the Royal Family
 for preparing speeches.The Queen takes
 her after-dinner guests to the library
 where some famous and important guests
 read about the lives of their family  
 antecedents.                          </content>
