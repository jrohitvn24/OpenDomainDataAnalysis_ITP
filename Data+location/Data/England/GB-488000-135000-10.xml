		<title>10HAPPY EATER RESTAURANT</title>
		<content>  WE WENT TO INTERVIEW THE STAFF AT THE
 HAPPY EATER RESTAURANT AND TO HAVE A  
 MEAL THERE AS IT FEATURES PROMINENTLY 
 IN THE LIFE STYLE OF MANY OF THE      
 YOUNGER RESIDENTS IN THE AREA.        
  IT IS OPEN FROM IOAM UNTIL           
 IOPM,SERVING ON AVERAGE 3OO MEALS A   
 DAY. THE STAFF FINDS THAT THE AVERAGE 
 PERSON SPENDS Â£3 ON A MEAL.           
  THE BUSIEST TIME DURING THE WEEK IS  
 AT LUNCH TIME, WEEKENDS AND ESPECIALLY
 SUNDAY AFTERNOON.DURING THE WEEK THE  
 HAPPY EATER IS USED MAINLY BY         
 BUSINESSMEN AND AT THE WEEKEND  BY    
 FAMILIES.THIS IS BECAUSE IT SERVES    
 FAST FOOD AND IS WELL EQUIPPED FOR    
 YOUNG CHILDREN, PROVIDING GAMES, LEGO,
 BOOSTER SEATS AND A CHILDREN'S MENU.  
  NEXT DOOR TO THE HAPPY EATER IS THE  
 TRAINING BRANCH WHERE THE RESTAURANT  
 MANAGERS ARE TRAINED.
