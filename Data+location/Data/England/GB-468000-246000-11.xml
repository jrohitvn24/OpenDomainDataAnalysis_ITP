		<content>    A survey was done to see what      
 people think of Towcester's{new       
{shopping centre.                      
{}                                     
    From the questions that were asked,
 it appears that most people do their  
{weekly}shopping at the supermarket    
 there and travel from a radius of     
 about{7 or 8 miles.                   
{                                      
    Out of about{50}people asked only{1
 person said that they didn't like the 
 centre, although several people said  
 that they would like to see more shops
 there, such as: a drycleaner's,       
                 a newsagent's         
                 a clothe's shop.      
                                       
    For most people who go to the      
 shopping centre, the supermarket is   
 the main reason for them going.
