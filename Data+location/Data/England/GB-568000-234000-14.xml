		<title>14CHURCH LIFE</title>
		<content> Cornish Hall End shares a vicar with  
 Finchingfield,so there is only 1      
 service on Sundays,2 on Festival days.
 In 1981,the church was in danger of   
 closing.The congregation was down to 7
 the churchwardens were both elderly,  
 and there was no other help.The church
 had no money,though much was needed   
 for repairs.A questionnaire was sent  
 to all 95 houses in the parish,asking 
 for offers of help.As a result,new    
 life has come to the church _ new     
 churchwardens appointed and the con-  
 gregation doubled.                    
                                       
 Autumn sees the church's Harvest      
 Festival,with an auction of produce   
 the next day.The main fund-raising    
 event,the Christmas Bazaar,is held in 
 the village hall,and the Christmas    
 Carol service is always well attended.
