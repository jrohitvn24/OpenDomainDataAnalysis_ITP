<title>34The Post Office and village store</title>
<content>

The Post Office, Ravensthorpe is housed in an attractive white washed cottage. It was built in 1610 with mud walls and a straw thatch, a brick and slate extension was added in 1875.&lt;br />&lt;br />The role of the Post Office in small communities like ours continues to diminish as more of its services are lost to other providers. Many locals also choose the convenience of having monies paid directly into bank accounts, paying bills by direct debit and using online services. &lt;br />&lt;br />Newspapers have become increasingly important to the viability of the business. They are sorted and delivered daily both to customers in Ravensthorpe and the neighbouring village of East Haddon. A range of groceries are sold to a small number of regular customers. &lt;br />&lt;br />   &lt;br />
