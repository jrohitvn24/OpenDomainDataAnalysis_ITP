		<title>08The Brick and Tile Industry</title>
		<content> The old Kiln is a well-known landmark 
in Nettlebed which stands at the east  
end of the village behind the green.The
industry was important to the village  
for several centuries, bricks and tiles
made at Crocker End and Nettlebed were 
supplied to Stonor House and           
Wallingford Castle.                    
Clay was mined from pits on the common 
to the north of the village and today  
ponds fill the remains of some old     
diggings.                              
In 1677 Dr.Plot wrote of the strength  
of Nettlebed bricks - they could be    
tipped from a cart without breaking.   
Census records for 1881 tell us that at
least a dozen men were working at      
either brickmaking or pottery          
producing tiles and earthenware pipes. 
The kiln was last used in 1938 when the
industry died.                         
                                       </content>
