 The commonest wild animal in Ilford is
 the Grey Squirrel. It is most         
 frequently seen in our local parks.   
 Shepherds Purse is the plant found in 
 many parts of Ilford. Most birds in   
 Ilford are Finches, but House Martins 
 can be seen nesting under the eaves of
 many houses during the summer months. 
                                       
 Feral Pigeons, Blackbirds, Sparrows   
 and Starlings frequent our local park,
 which is Valentines Park. Feral       
 Pigeons are usually found on buildings
 and in the town. Quite a lot are found
 in the grounds of our school,         
 Christchurch School. The Horse        
 Chestnut is quite common in our local 
 park as is the Oak and the Sycamore.
