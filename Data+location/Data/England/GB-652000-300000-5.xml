		<content> In the future there will be a         
 maternity theatre &amp; also a swimming   
 pool for people with paralised limbs &amp;
 other muscular handicaps.             
   There is a day centre so that people
 can learn to cope for themselves at   
 home rather than stay in hospital     
 permanently. There is also a speech   
 therapy centre.                       
   The hospital also provides a bank a 
 shop &amp; a hair dressing salon. There is
 a playroom for the childen who are    
 just visiting &amp; one for childen who   
 are patients.                         
   The hospital is the main posting    
 centre for the area. Letters from     
 other hospitals come here to be       
 franked &amp; sorted. Letters can be sent 
 to people inside the hospital or      
 outside.
