 HOLIDAYS, TRIPS OR WHEN THEY GO TO THE
 BATHS.SOME PEOPLE GO VISITING WITH    
 THEIR FAMILIES, OR TO GO SHOPPING.    
 FAMILIES GET TOGETHER TO GO ON        
 PICNICS, ON WALKS.LOTS MORE THINGS    
 LIKE WEDDINGS OR JUST TO COME AND SEE 
 THEM.WHERE I LIVE PEOPLE GET TOGETHER 
 OCCASSIONALLY JUST TO SEE EACH OTHER. 
 SOME PEOPLE JUST SEE EACH OTHER NEARLY
 EVERY DAY.VERY FEW PEOPLE UP WHERE    
 I LIVE DON'T LIKE TO SEE THEIR        
 FAMILIES.I BET EVERYONE WHERE I LIVE  
 LOVES TO SEE THEIR FAMILIES SOME TIME 
 OR ANOTHER.MOST OF MY FAMILY LIVE     
 QUITE CLOSE TO TOGETHER SO I THINK I
