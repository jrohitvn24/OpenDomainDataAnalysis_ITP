		<content>     To the far N of the block lies the
 grand Worksop Manor at the centre of  
 its large estate. Its present form    
 owes a lot to earlier buildings on the
 same site.                            
     The first great house was built by
 the 6th Earl of Shrewsbury (Bess of   
 Hardwicks 4th and last husband) during
 the 1570's. This fine building,       
 designed by Robert Smythson, outshone 
 other such buildings of the period.   
     By marriage the Manor became the  
 property of the Dukes of Norfolk but  
 unfortunately it was burnt down in    
 1761. James Paine was given the task  
 of designing the new house. Building  
 began but came to an abrupt halt      
 following the death of the heir.      
     In 1839 the 12th Duke sold the    
 Manor and the Estate to the 4th Duke  
 of Newcastle who, as he already had a 
 nearby Manor, pulled it down.         </content>
