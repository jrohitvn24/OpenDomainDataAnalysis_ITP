		<content> IN THE NORTH OF ENGLAND A LOT OF      
 PEOPLE ESPECIALLY MEN,PASS THEIR SPARE
 TIME BY KEEPING PIGEONS AS THEIR      
 HOBBY AND RACING THEM.THEY KEEP THEM  
 IN THEIR GARDENS WHERE THEY BUILD     
 PIGEON CREES.THEY BUILD THE CREES     
 THEMSELVES, EACH IS PAINTED IN        
 DIFFERENT COLORS.THERE IS A PIGEON    
 CLUB AND EVERY FRIDAY A BIG           
 TRANSPORTER COMES AND THE PIGEONS GO  
 AWAY IN BASKETS AND RACE BACK HOME    
 SOMETIMES THEY RACE FROM AS FAR AS    
 FRANCE.IF YOU GET FIRST SECOND OR     
 THIRD PLACE YOU WIN MONEY SOME OF THE 
 MEN HAVE PRIVATE BETS BETWEEN         
 THEMSELVES.BUT SOMETIMES THE PIGEONS  
 DON'T RETURN THEY EITHER GET LOST OR  
 KILLED.AT THE END OF THE YEAR THEY    
 HAVE A PIGEON DINNER WHERE THE MEN WHO
 HAVE WON THE MOST POINTS WIN CUPS.THEY
 GAIN POINTS BY HOW MANY RACES THEY    
 WIN.  STUART WOOD                     </content>
