as been owned by the Seymour family    
since the 18th century.Today,Hugh      
Seymour has the title making him the   
8th Marquis of Hertford.The Marquis and
his family live in Ragley Hall,which is
about 1 and a half miles away from     
Alcester.The Hall has been open to the 
public  since 1948,and about 80 000    
tourists visit it each year.The Marquis
and his family live in the rooms open  
to the public,as well as their own     
private quarters.The money from the    
public provides the money needed to run
the Hall and its grounds.In fact 90% of
the Marquis's intake is from tourists, 
and the other 10% is from the woodland 
and farms.The most famous part of the  
house is the mural called 'The         
Temptation' which was painted by 1 man,
over a period of 13 and a half years.
