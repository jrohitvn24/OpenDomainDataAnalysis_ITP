		<title>03PENZANCE SHOPS AND TRAFFIC</title>
		<content>  We surveyed Market Jew Street,       
 Chapel Street,Causewayhead and        
 Alverton Street.{Market Jew Street}is 
 the main road through the middle of   
 the town,becoming Averton Street at   
 the top,and Chapel Street and Cause-  
 wayhead meet it at the Market House.  
 Lots of cars go through Penzance,so   
 Market Jew Street has the most shops. 
  Jams sometimes occur at the top where
 the roads meet,because of a zebra     
 crossing.However,shoppers have mixed  
 feelings about the new planned        
 distributor road that will{by-pass    
 Penzance. It will help development,   
 but will destroy existing houses and  
 gardens.                              
  Alverton Street has the least shops, 
 because it has many services. Chapel  
 Street is only a one-way street.      
 Causewayhead is a new shopping area,  
 rivalling Market Jew Street.    Hea.  </content>
