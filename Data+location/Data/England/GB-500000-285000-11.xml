		<title>11BARNWELL PARK - FACILITIES</title>
		<content> As you go into the park there is a map
 on the wall at the office which tells 
 you where the lakes are.There is a lot
 to do in the park like fishing,bird   
 watching and picnics or even just     
 walking around it. Sixth-formers      
 from Prince William School have       
 even done a little simple             
 orienteering there. There is a car    
 park,picnic benches,safety            
 equipment,litter bins,toilets and a   
 new hall extension to the warden's    
 office opened on 25.7.1985. The       
 safety facilities are good. There are 
 alarms and life rings. The park       
 has rules like keeping dogs on leads  
 and you must have a rod licence to    
 fish etc.There is a warden's office   
 in case of emergencies or to get      
 information about the park.Also the   
 park is easy to walk round as there   
 are foot paths and bridges to walk on.</content>
