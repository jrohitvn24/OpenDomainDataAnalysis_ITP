		<title>18THE LIFE OF A MINER</title>
		<content> It is a hard and dangerous job working
 underground at Creswell Colliery.     
 People can still remember Tuesday     
 September 26th 1950 when forty miners 
 went to work down the pit and never   
 returned. There is a memorial stone in
 the church yard to the miners who died
 in that terrible disaster.            
 Jonathan's dad is a deputy at the     
 colliery and it is his job to check   
 the safety of the mine and to help    
 organise the work underground. An     
 important part of his job is to check 
 for gas down the mine and make sure   
 the levels do not get too high.       
 The colliery has to work 24 hours a   
 day, so the miners have to work a     
 shift system. At Creswell Colliery the
 day shift is from 6.00 a.m. to 1.30   
 p.m., the afternoon shift from 12.30  
 p.m. to 7.45 p.m. and the night shift 
 from 10.00 p.m. to 5.15 a.m.          </content>
