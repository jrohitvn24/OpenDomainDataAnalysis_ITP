		<content> In our area block there is only one   
 school that is South Hykeham primary  
 school.In the school there are only 56
 children altogether.There are three   
 teachers and three classrooms so a    
 teacher to a class. There are three   
 female teachers at the school. Three  
 quarters of the pupils live in North  
 Hykeham. Most of them go there because
 their familys were taught there.      
   The children go to school by a      
 variety of ways.Some go by car,some   
 walk and some use bicycles.           
   The school was once owned by        
 the church but it is now owned by the 
 County Council.An extension has been  
 added to the original school room.    
  Because there a so few children at   
 the school they do not take part in   
 any football or netball leagues or    
 competitions, although they do have   
 netball and football pitches.         </content>
