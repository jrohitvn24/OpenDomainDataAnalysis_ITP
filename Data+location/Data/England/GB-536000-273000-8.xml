		<title>08FEN CURES AND SUPERSTITIONS</title>
		<content> In the{fens}people{believed}in, and   
 did some unusual things to{cure       
{illneses.}                            
 Many people had{rheumatism,}one cure  
 was to get a{spider}and eat it alive  
 in a pastry package, or hang one      
 around the neck.To keep{evil spirits  
{away, Bluntisham}people often tied a  
 red ribbon around their leg. For{Fen  
{Ague,}a type of flu, people carried a 
 mole{or hare's foot,}around with them.
{Slugs}were hung on nails in rooms to  
 charm and get rid of{warts,}the slugs 
 were first wiped on the warts then    
 pinned up.This is still done today.   
 People also often stole some{meat}and 
 wiped their warts with it and{buried} 
 the meat.As the meat decayed it was   
 supposed to make the{warts vanish.}
