 have 6 very good comprehensive schools

 preference -

 bridge 340 pupils approximatley       
 Harrogate Granby High School 1835     
 pupils approximatley

 approxmatley

 St. Aidans C.E. School 1355 pupils "  
 St. John Fishers R.C. school 900 " "  
 In November every year the schools    
 arrange meetings so that parents and  
 children visit &amp; decide which school  
 is suitable for their particular      
 child. Later on they must complete the
 parents preference form giving the    
 order of choice which they have made. 
 In most cases this is possible.       </content>
