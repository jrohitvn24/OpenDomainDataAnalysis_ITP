		<title>04The Queen Anne Pub.</title>
		<content> The earliest mention of the pub is    
 1825, but the actual date has not been
 found. The site of the Inn was known  
 as{"Cock Clod"}and it was for         
 fighting. If a man wanted to fight, he
 would go to this plot of land and     
 stand there, challenging the whole    
 town. If his challenge was not        
 accepted, then he would become the    
 champion of Cock Clod. In 1835, the   
 Inn was a {Magistrates' Office.}      
 Offenders were put in the cellar,     
 which today retains the appearance of 
 a prison. A tunnel leading from the   
 cellar to the other side of the Market
 place, has been bricked up. In the    
 1850's the Inn was used as a          
 recruiting office for the {Army,}where
 they were encouraged to drink too     
 much,and when drunk, they were taken  
 into the cellar and "recruited" into  
 the Army.                             </content>
