		<title>19The Village Pump</title>
		<content> On the 13th May,1985, the Earl of     
 Scarbrough unveiled the plaque to open
 the new village pump in Braithwell. It
 was donated by Mr. and Mrs. Appleyard,
 long standing residents of the        
 village. Two stone troughs were gifts,
 one from the Earl of Scarbrough and   
 the other from Mr.H.Garrison. The     
 plaques were donated by               
 Mr.T. Plowright and the curtains by   
 M.A.Smythe. The Earl of Scarbrough    
 drew the first water from the pump,   
 wishing everyone peace and prosperity.
 Reverend Eccles then said a short     
 prayer to bless the pump. Afterwards  
 refreshments were served in the Red   
 Lion public house and many villagers  
 attended this special occasion.       
 This event shows that community spirit
 is still alive in Braithwell.
