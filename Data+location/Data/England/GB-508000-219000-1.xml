		<title>01GAZETTEER:SOUTH EAST LUTON</title>
		<content> It is almost certain that William of  
 Normandy visited the royal manor of   
 Luton between October and Christmas   
 1066 en-route with his army during    
 their long and circuitous progress    
 from Hastings to London. Most of      
 Luton's green S.E.landscape of his    
 time has long since disappeared under 
 residential urban development.Ready   
 motorway,rail and airport access fa-  
 cilitate fast inter-city and inter-   
 national travel whilst urban traffic  
 congestion increases!                 
    Shopping facilities are good.Out-  
 door recreational amenities are poor. 
 Most homes have T.V.sets and several  
 elec.powered domestic appliances.With 
 very few exceptions,the children of   
 the area are very well fed and clothed
 but family instability is a serious   
 and growing problem for both School   
 and the Social Services. {      N.W.  </content>
