		<title>08A WEEKEND.</title>
		<content> On a Saturday I laze around all day.  
 Most people like weekends because they
 can relax after a hard_working        
 week.Some people like to sit in their 
 favourite chair all day watching sport
 on the Television. Others like to     
 concentrate on thier hobbies, like    
 gardening, cooking or sport.On a      
 Sunday some like to go to a Church or 
 Chaple service.Also on a Sunday some  
 people have a "Sunday Dinner" which is
 meat,potatoes,vegtables,Yorkshire     
 Puddings and gravy.On a Saturday      
 morning there are cartoons or         
 interesting things on woodwork or     
 sewing on the television for children 
 then most of the rest of the day is   
 sport.On a Sunday it is all sport     
 until about 5.30p.m.then there are    
 drama programme and series.The village
 Newsagents is open from 6a.m.till     
 6p.m. on a Saturday,8am to 12.30pm Sun</content>
