		<content> The moors around Middlezoy make up the
 best area for breeding wading birds in
 the south-west of England. The most   
 commonly seen of the waders are       
 lapwings, curlews, redshank and snipe.
 In summer smaller birds such as yellow
 wagtails, which have emigrated from   
 Africa, use the moors as their        
 breeding ground attracted by the      
 undrained grazing meadows. Whinchats  
 and sedge warblers nest among the     
 taller vegetation alongside the rhynes
 (as the ditches are known in this     
 area).                                
 The pollarded willows which grow along
 many of the rhynes provide nesting    
 holes for birds such as owls, tree    
 sparrows and redstarts. Mallards and  
 mute swans also build nests here.     
 There are other breeding birds in the 
 area, but these are the ones that     
 depend on the unusual landscape.      </content>
