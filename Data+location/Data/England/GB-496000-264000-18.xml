		<title>18 Rushden Water Tower</title>
		<content>  The water tank is 100ft high,(there  
are 108 rungs to the top) domed and in 
a 35 year old, octagonal building with 
windows in alternate  sides. No-one    
works there but the water is tested    
weekly and pumps regularly checked (the
tank is cleaned 4 yearly).             
  A house uses 70 to 90 gals. per day. 
The tank handles 500000 gals. per day, 
although the tank is not that big,     
water is always being pumped through   
it. The pump operates automatically.   
  The water comes from Grafham Water, a
huge reservoir in Cambridgeshire. It is
cleaned, pumped down a main pipe, a    
branch of which supplies Rushden.      
  The tower only has enough pressure to
supply  part of Rushden. An underground
reservoir next to the tower supplies   
the lowest part of the town            
  Several other towers serving nearby  
towns, can be seen from the tank's top.</content>
