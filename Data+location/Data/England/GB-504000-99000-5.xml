		<content>          Lugworms                     
     At low tide local fishermen dig   
 between the cast and nearby hole to   
 find lugworms. By doing this they     
 expose the U-shaped burrow in which   
 they live. The bristly, greenish body 
 can be found with its thin tail       
 nearest to the funnel shaped hole.    
     When moist, decaying seaweed and  
 pebbles are disturbed,the miniature   
 sandy-grey sandhopper is seen hopping 
 away. This crustacean has its body    
 flattened from side to side.          
     Cuttlefish spawn near the shore in
 June.  Their bodies and eggs are often
 washed ashore.  Once the flesh has    
 rotted the white chalky bone is       
 exposed, which is sometimes given to  
 birds as a source of calcium.         
     Of the many seaweeds found, sea   
 lettuce, bladder wrack and carragreen 
 are the most common.                  </content>
