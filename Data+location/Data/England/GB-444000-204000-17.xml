		<content> The best known historical character   
 associated with the area is Amy       
 Robsart wife of Robert Dudley, Earl of
 Leicester. She died at Cumnor Place.  
 "Did she fall or was she pushed?" Her 
 death was convenient for her husband  
 who sought to become the husband of   
 Queen Elizabeth I. The mystery, which 
 is the subject of Sir Walter Scott's  
 novel "Kenilworth" has never been     
 solved.                               
 The hill between Cumnor and Farmoor is
 known as "Tumbledown Dick". Tradition 
 has it that it was named for Oliver   
 Cromwell's son Richard, who was almost
 certainly in this area during the     
 Civil War, but no specific evidence   
 has been found to link him with       
 Cumnor.
