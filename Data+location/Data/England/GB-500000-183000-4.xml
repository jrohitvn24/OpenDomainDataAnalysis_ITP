		<title>04   THE M25 MOTORWAY</title>
		<content>                                       
 The workmen building the M25 have had 
 many problems including soft sand in  
 which they had to lay 800 piles so    
 they could build on top of it.Several 
 horses have lost their lives in the   
 sand.They have also had to build on   
 boggy land in Gladstone Forest.The    
 sand is called Glaciel and  has come  
 from the ice age.The motorway which   
 has gone through many homes has ruined
 peoples lives.Home Farm are worried   
 that their house might fall into the  
 motorway.The motorway goes down 10m it
 is 35m across.The sloping banks are   
 45m down and the bridges are around   
 15.20 feet above the motorway.The     
 workmen have had to establish a       
 friendly relationship with the people 
 they are taking land from.
