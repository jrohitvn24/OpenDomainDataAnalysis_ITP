		<title>14Dovercourt's Old Lighthouses</title>
		<content> The shifting shoals off Harwich have  
 meant that lights have been provided  
 for the guidance of mariners for      
 centuries.The earliiest recorded      
 lighthouses were at Harwich Green in  
 1664. The two lighthouses             
 formed "leading lights" where mariners
 must get one light positioned above   
 the other, to be on the correct course
 through the shoals of the harbour     
 entrance. But the channel for the     
 harbour was changing direction and it 
 was for this reason that the Harwich  
 lights were discontinued in 1863.     
 The result of this was that in        
 1862 Trinity House built two iron     
 pile "movable " lighthouses on the    
 Dovercourt foreshore, with legal      
 powers to move the structure to any   
 site elsewhere on the foreshore.
