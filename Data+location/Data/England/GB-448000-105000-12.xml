		<title>12The Strawberry Industry</title>
		<content>  Strawberry growing has been most     
 important in this area since{1860}.   
  The strawberry grows well on the     
{light stony soil}which warms up       
 quickly in Spring and gives an{early  
{market}sale to London and other       
 markets.                              
  Prayers used to be said so that the  
 weather would be good.Schools used to 
 take their holidays from mid-June to  
 mid-July to coincide with the{picking 
{period. }                             
  By importing{gypsies and travellers  
 the problem of labour was solved.Many 
 of the travellers actually stopped    
 moving around and settled locally.The 
 special{fruit trains}left at 10 a.m.  
 The so called "{Strawberry Line}" was 
 opened in 1888.A{basket factory}was   
 built nearby in 1913.                 
  Now many of the strawberry fields    
 have houses built on them.            </content>
