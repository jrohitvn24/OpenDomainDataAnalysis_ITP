		<title>03How Space Affects Me</title>
		<content>In 1961 the first man went into space. 
Yuri Gagirin went into space for 1 hour
48 minuets in Vostok 1. Since then the 
world has sent lots of spacecrafts into
space. America has sent the Apolo      
spacecrafts and has made a new type of 
rocket the Shuttle. The Shuttle is     
basicly the shape and size of D.C.9 and
can be used time and time again so that
the Americans do not have to spend     
more money each time they send a       
rocket in space. The Russians have     
sent the Vostok rockets into space and 
have stuck to the same design. The way 
space has changed me is that of having 
Sattalites in space which means I can  
watch t.v live from another country and
I can comunicate with other countries  
witout having to wait for days while   
the boat travels to the country you    
want.I just couldn't of done this 25   
years ago.         Daniel Sparkes.     </content>
