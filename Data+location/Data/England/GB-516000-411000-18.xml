		<title>18Our favourite foods</title>
		<content> I did a survey about favourite foods. 
 First I asked about meals.Most        
 children liked chips because of the   
 taste and the texture.But chips are   
 not good for you and people are       
 beginning to be more concerned about  
 having good foods.Another food that   
 stood out was fish and fishfingers.   
 Fried food like this is not healthy   
 either but if it is grilled it is     
 better.Most people didn't like fresh  
 vegetables beause of the taste which  
 is strong.The texture too puts people 
 off.These foods are good for you.I    
  also asked about snacks.All the      
 children eat between meals.Most liked 
 sweets like  chocolate bars.But some  
 preferred crisps which are better for 
 your teeth.In fact half the class have
 had one or more fillings probably     
 because of the sugar in sweets which  
 decays teeth.                         </content>
