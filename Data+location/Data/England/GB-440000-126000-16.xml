		<content>  In the past , recreational use of the
 countryside was mostly confined to the
 rich and powerful . Thus the Bishops  
 of Winchester would use Merdon Castle 
 with its surrounding forests as a     
 lodge for deer-hunting .              
  Although there are still many deer in
 the area , they are no longer hunted .
 The huntsmen today pursue foxes and   
 hares . The woods around Merdon Castle
 ring to a different sort of hunting   
 however - the shooting of pheasant .  
 Use as a game preserve means that the 
 landowner carefully protects the      
 interesting historical remains of the 
 castle from any access by the general 
 public . There is no game shooting on 
 Mr.Race's farm , unlike many of the   
 larger farms in Hampshire , despite   
 the presence of plenty of pheasant and
 partridge .
