		<content>    Farmhouse near Laverton has        
 indications of much earlier work      
 within its structure.  Of the 22      
 houses in the immediate vicinity of   
 Hemington village, 10 are owner       
 occupies, 5 privately rented (in one  
 terrace), 3 agricultural tenancies, 3 
 tenanted farms (Ammerdown Estate) and 
 one housing association tenancy.  The 
 school, which at present has about 40 
 pupils and two full time teachers,    
 draws only 7 children from Hemington  
 village, and there are no pre-school  
 children in the village - the         
 population is heavily unbalanced      
 towards the 45 plus age group.  In    
 Hemington parish as a whole however   
 there are (1981  census) 102 children 
 in the 5 to 14 age group and 47 under 
 5, together making 23% of the total   
 population, which is above the        
 national average.                     </content>
