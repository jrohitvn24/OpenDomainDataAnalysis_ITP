		<title>13A DAY IN MY LIFE by Ian</title>
		<content> I have to get up early because my mum 
 and dad go to work. I choose my own   
 clothes every morning. I have to go to
 my friends house except on Saturday   
 and Sunday. I come to school at 5 past
 8 because I help in the nursery. Then 
 when the bell goes we go to our       
 classroom to have the register then we
 go to assembly or hymn practice. When 
 we go back to class 7 we do some      
 number work then we check our number  
 work. After we do some english work.  
 Then we go to groups with Mrs Thake.  
 Then we have dinner. Afterwards we    
 usually do topic work. Then we go     
 home.When I am at home my mum has put 
 our tea on the table. Then we put on  
 the T.V.to watch childrens I.T.V. Then
 I wash up and I stay up to watch T.V. 
 until I go to bed at half past eight.
