		<title>10 Housing in West Wellow.</title>
		<content>Housing in West Wellow is far from the 
church because of the plague which     
attacked the area in C.17th.The        
villagers burned down their old houses.
Replacement houses were built away from
the church.Before modernisation the    
housing consisted of farms and cottages
found between Maury's Lane and Gazing  
Lane.Luke's Farm,Maury's Lane was built
around 1685 of timber and wattle on    
flint,and clay with flagstone floors.It
has seen many changes.The old post     
office,also C.17th,is made of half inch
bricks.Another old C.18th cottage is   
Slab Cottage.                          
   Old cottages built in the C.17th    
surround Snobs Corner."Gables",Gazing  
Lane built of mud and wattle has a     
timber frame and slate roof.The rooms  
are dark because of small windows and  
low ceilings.Original wooden beams are 
still visible.                         </content>
