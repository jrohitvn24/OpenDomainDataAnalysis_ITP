		<content> The founder of Kelly College was      
 Benedictus Marwood Kelly,who was born 
 at Holsworthy in 1785.After he died in
 1807 he left money to found a school  
 for "descendants of the Kelly family  
 and the sons of naval officers and    
 other gentlemen."The foundation stone 
 was laid on June 4 1875.The college   
 was opened in October 1877 with 12    
 boys.The school has since grown and   
 changed a great deal and girls were   
 admitted into the Sixth Form in 1970  
 Kelly now has science laboratories    
 music rooms,a gymnasium, workshops and
 extensive playing fields. Its heated  
 swimming pool and squash courts were  
 opened in 1977 by H.R.H.Prince        
 Charles.The school now has its own    
 swimming squad whose members have     
 often been included in the British    
 Olympic Swimming Team, two of these   
 being Sharon Davis and Robin Brew.    </content>
