 The church at Kirby Hill is called St 
Peter and St Felix it used to be       
called St John the Baptist. Parts of   
the building date from the 11th        
Century, the nave seems to date from   
this time with a chancel added in the  
12th Century,later a tower and aisles  
were built.                            
 One interesting feature of the church 
is a lepers squint. Six church wardens 
are chosen every six years, their names
are put onto wax balls which are placed
in a bowl of water in the parish chest.
Every two years the chest is opened two
wax balls are taken out the names      
inside are the wardens for the next two
years.
