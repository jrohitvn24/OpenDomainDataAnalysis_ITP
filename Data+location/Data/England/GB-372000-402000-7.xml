   Many of the streets north of        
 Manchester Road bear names which      
 originate from Salford rather than    
 Walkden or Little Hulton. This is     
 significant because this area is known
 as "Salford Overspill".               
 This name originates from 1946 when   
 Salford Corporation attempted to      
 solve its housing shortage by building
 council property in Little Hulton.    
 The work commenced in October 1948 and
 by July 1966 4500 houses had been     
 built.The connection of the present   
 community with Salford is shown by the
 fact that in the present class of     
 eleven year olds at St. Edmunds R.C.  
 Primary School 33%of the children, 55%
 of their parents and 70% of their     
 grand_parents were born in Salford.
