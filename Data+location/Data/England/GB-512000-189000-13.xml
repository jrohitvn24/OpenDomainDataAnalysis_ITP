		<content>  The minister of{Pinner United Free   
{Church}has been a minister for 14     
 years but has been at this church for 
 only 1 year.  About 80 adults, 20     
 children and 8 Sunday School teachers 
 come to the 10.30am service on Sunday 
 and about 40 people come to the       
 evening service. Most of the people   
 are from the Pinner district. The     
 minister said that he likes family    
 services best and that he performed   
 about 6 marriages per year.  The      
 church is very busy because on Monday 
 there is Cub Scouts; on Tuesday, a    
 Women's Meeting, Beavers and Brownies;
 Wednesday, Bible Studies and a Mothers
 and Toddlers Group; Thursday, Venture 
 Scouts and Rangers; Friday, Guides and
 a Bereavement Centre for people whose 
 relatives have died; Saturday, a Youth
 Club. Every day, there is someone on  
 the phone who will listen to problems.</content>
