		<content>   Lingfield is a prosperous village of
 between three and four thousand       
 people. The railway has contributed to
 its prosperity, providing a commuter  
 service for white_ collar workers to  
 London, Croydon and East Grinstead.   
   Once largely a rural area there are 
 still 15 small farms. But now         
 increasingly unbanished, Lingfield and
 Newchapel together offer some 30 shops
 and 80 services and light industries. 
 Most are small businesses, each       
 employing a handful of people.        
   Dominating the area is Lingfield    
 Park Racecourse with its staff of 35. 
 Other larger employers are nationally 
 known companies like Geest Industries 
 (wholesale greengrocers) and Rentokil 
 (wood preservation specialist). There 
 is little unemployment here.
