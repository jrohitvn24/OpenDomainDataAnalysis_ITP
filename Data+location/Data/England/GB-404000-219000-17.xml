		<title>17PLACE NAMES-SALPERTON AREA</title>
		<content> Both Salperton and Hampen are         
 mentioned in the 11th Century Domesday
 Book.There are two suggestions for the
 origin of SALPERTON.One is O.E. sealh-
 burna,"willow stream";the other is    
 O.E. salt-herepae,associated with the 
 Salt Way that passed nearby.The ending
 is the Old English "tun" = farmstead. 
 At one time Salperton was called Cold 
 Salperton and in the  ecclesiastical  
 parish records it is still known by   
 that name.It was called "cold" because
 of its exposed position.              
 Hampen, written as Hagepinne in The   
 Domesday Book, is derived from O.E.   
 Hagena pen = Hagena's sheep pen or    
 enclosure.
