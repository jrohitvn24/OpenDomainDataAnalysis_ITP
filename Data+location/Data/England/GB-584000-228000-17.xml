		<content> My mum and dad's business is called{  
{Colne Heating}.They stock a range of  
 about 60 different stoves and cookers.
 The stoves and cookers come from all  
 over{England}and they also import     
 cookers from{Italy}.They have 2       
 plumbers and a lady comes in several  
 days of the week.My dad has been      
 selling stoves for the last 4 years   
 and before that he used to sell 1 kind
 of stove which he made.Lots of people 
 are buying stoves now because they are
 finding it a lot cheaper than other   
 sources of heat.Stoves are            
 approximately 75cm wide,stoves        
 normally has 2 doors at the front and 
 you can either have a chimney coming  
 out the back of the stove and up or   
 you can have the chimney going        
 straight up.
