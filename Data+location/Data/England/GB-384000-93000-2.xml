		<content> Looking north from the school mound   
 in the middle of the playground is the
 village. Traffic on two roads meets in
 the middle. On a slope is the church  
 among big trees . In the distance     
 is a big house with more trees round  
 it.Near the roads are smaller houses  
 and the watercress beds.The bypass    
 goes behind the village.On the slope  
 of Woodbury Hill are jersey and       
 friesian cows in the fields and woods 
 on the top of the hill.The road runs  
 along the bottom.To the east is the   
 river running through fields where    
 cows graze.The watercress train goes  
 backwards and forwards from one farm  
 to the other beside the river.On      
 the slope are ploughed fields.To the  
 south is a large farm and the Purbeck 
 Hills behind.Next to the playground is
 a close of semi-detached houses and   
 behind the school is Black Hill.{     </content>
