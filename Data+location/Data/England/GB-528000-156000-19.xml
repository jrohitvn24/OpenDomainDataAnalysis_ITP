		<title>19Environs of Netherne Hosp'l.</title>
		<content>  Most of the land surrounding Netherne
Hospital is associated with it. It is  
private land with its own private roads
for access only. The only public road  
running through is the "C" road which  
runs from Coulsdon to Hooley, parallel 
to the A23.                            
  To the west of this road are annexes 
to the hospital and to the east: staff 
housing. Most of the remaining area is 
arable farmland rented out to farmers. 
  There is also a considerable area of 
woodland, characteristic of the three  
1km x 1km squares:2856, 2857 and 2956. 
Small woods, often with both deciduous 
and coniferous foliage all have their  
own names e.g. Netherne &amp; Boxers Wood. 
  North of the staff housing, to the   
east of the C-road, is situated the    
Netherne Sports and Social Club (P.18)
