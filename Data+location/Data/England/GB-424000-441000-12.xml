		<content> In Bramhope most people travel to work
 in Leeds,which is 20kms away.17 people
 work in Bramhope itself.The majority  
 work within a 25km radius of          
 Bramhope.11 people work farther       
 afield.                               
 The majority of Bramhope residents    
 we questioned were involved in what we
 termed{"Services to people"}i.e.      
{Banking,Teaching,Health,Catering,     
{Public Services,Communication,Law etc.
 A much smaller group was involved in  
{Manufacturing Industries.}Fewer people
 still had jobs in the{Retail Trade.   
 Most children we talked to expect to  
 move out of Bramhope to get a job.    
 Two local families own a nearby farm  
 and the children expect to work on the
 farm when they leave school.
