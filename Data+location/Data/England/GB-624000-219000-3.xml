		<content> Frinton especially has seen a huge    
 increase in the immigration of        
 pensioners, and consequently, the     
 Frinton/Walton area has the highest   
 number of elderly people in the whole 
 of Essex, with over three times the   
 national average.                     
                                       
 The age structure is however more     
 balanced in the centre of Walton.     
 This is a result of the fact that     
 houses in this area are less suited to
 elderly inhabitants.  It includes     
 large houses, rather than bungalows,  
 bed and breakfast establishments, and 
 flats situated above shops.           
                                       
 The large excess of deaths over births
 due to the imbalanced age structure   
 has given rise to small families in   
 the area compared with the rest of    
 Essex.                                </content>
