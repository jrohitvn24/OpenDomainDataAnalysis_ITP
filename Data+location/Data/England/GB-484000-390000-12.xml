 has lived in the village for thirty   
 years.

 trade, selling his draught ales,      
 Scotch bitter, mild, Whitbread bitter,
 larger and cider.                     
  The public house encourages pastime  
 activities and donates prizes to the  
 darts and dominoes league as well as  
 collecting for the blind and kidney   
 research.

 the friendly atmosphere and quiet bar 
 in which he has a juke box , two video
 machines and a fruit machine.
