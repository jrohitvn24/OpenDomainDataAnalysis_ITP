		<content> We have a small playground with       
 hopscotch sqares and a netball pitch  
 marked on it. We have to stay on it in
 Winter but in Summer we can use the   
 field. The games played are hopscotch 
 , British bulldog , catch , skipping ,
 marbles , stuck in the mud , racing   
 toy cars and tennis . It is hard not  
 to knock little people over in Winter 
 but the field has lots of room to run 
 and shout and make dens. When the men 
 have cut the grass we make nests with 
 all the grass. The boys have soldiers 
 and tanks and space toys but we have  
 Barbie dolls , Little Ponies and care 
 bears. Tennis is very popular at the  
 moment because of Wimbledon and we use
 plastic racquets and sponge balls that
 go on the roof. In marbles we play    
 HITSIES and POTSIES . In hitsies you  
 have to hit someone else's marble but 
 in potsies you ain for a tiny hole.   </content>
