		<content>   We interviewed twelve people from   
 Frettenham and Spixworth all of which 
 had colour televisions.               
   Six had dogs, four had cats,three   
 had birds, two had fish and one person
 had a rodent. (some people had more   
 than one pet)                         
   Nine people belonged to clubs.      
   The average household had four      
 people.                               
   Most families had one car.          
   More people had lived in their      
 present house for more than ten       
 years.                                
   Unusually for this area coal was    
 used in six of the houses for heating.
 (six=coal,three=electricity,three=gas)
   Most families had two bicycles.     
   Only three people had computers.    
   Five people had video recorders.    
   Everybody had a newspaper/magazine  
 delivered to their door.              </content>
