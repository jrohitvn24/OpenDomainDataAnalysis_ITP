   There are many street markets in the
area, the most famous being 'Petticoat 
Lane'. This stretches along Wentworth  
Street from Aldgate to Liverpool       
Bishopsgate. It is open on Wednesdays  
and Sundays, the Sunday opening being  
most popular. Often the crowds are so  
great it is almost impossible to walk  
freely along the main trading roads.   
There is a sign up near the Aldgate End
saying 'Welcome to the World Famous    
Petticoat Lane Market.' Indeed, it has 
become a major tourist attraction. On  
sale are clothes, new and used, toys,  
records, and all kinds of              
brick-a-brack.                         
   The market was started by the local 
Jewish people early this century; the  
new Asian community now take an active 
part in maintaining the hustle and     
bustle of 'The Lane'.                  </content>
