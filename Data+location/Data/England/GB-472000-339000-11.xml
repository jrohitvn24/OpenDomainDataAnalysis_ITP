		<title>11THE WHATTON EXCHANGE</title>
		<content> The British Telecom system that we    
 have is efficient enough for our      
 village because there are no          
 industries. Most of the connecting is 
 done by hand but there is not an awful
 lot of connecting to do. The system is
 constantly being made better, as      
 British Telecom develop more          
 technically advanced equipment.       
 Whatton Exchange is connected with two
 in Nottingham because if one becomes  
 busy they can use the other exchange. 
 75% of the population in this village 
 have a telephone in their home. It is 
 important that we have an exchange in 
 Whatton, but with the advances made   
 in electronics it may soon become     
 obsolete. It is a most important job, 
 working at British Telecom. They take 
 special notice of the 999 calls so    
 they can connect straight away.
