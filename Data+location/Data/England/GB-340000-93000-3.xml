		<content>    The steep rise of Verriotts lane,  
 N. of the A.35 road at Morcombelake,  
 leads to some fourteen or fifteen     
 individually designed houses, each one
 having grounds of half to one acre in 
 extent. Many of the houses have been  
 bought by newly retired professional  
 people from other parts of England who
 much appreciate the natural coastal   
 beauty of the area which is visible to
 the south from their lofty viewpoints.
 They develop their hobby as gardeners,
 making very attractive landscaped     
 settings for their houses.            
    The houses built on the highest    
 point in the group lead to the        
 heathland heights of Hardown Hill,    
 over 600ft., which offers interesting 
 walks along narrow paths amongst gorse
 and ling. The air is invigorating and 
 the views both landwards and seawards 
 are very attractive.                  </content>
