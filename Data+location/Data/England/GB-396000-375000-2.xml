		<content>   The underlying rock of this area is 
 a coarse sandstone known locally as   
 gritstone.From its upper reaches drain
 a considerable number of streams      
 mainly in a westerly or south westerly
 direction,whose valley sides are very 
 steep.                                
   The whole area is dominated by      
 sheep farming with just a dozen or    
 so scattered and isolated farmsteads, 
 being responsible for the entire area.
 It is therefore an area of extremely  
 sparse population and, as it contains 
 no major manufacturing industries,is  
 not intruded upon by primary lines of 
 communication, nor has it any of the  
 amenities of city, town or village,it 
 is an area of peace and tranquility,  
 absolutely free from all forms of     
 pollution.
