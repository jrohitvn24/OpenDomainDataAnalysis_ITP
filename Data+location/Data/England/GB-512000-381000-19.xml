		<content>    At{Bleasby Moor,}but actually      
 in Lissington parish, there are two   
 large sheds, 260 by 40 feet, in which 
 some 135,000 hens are kept on the     
 battery system,that is,they are kept  
 in wire cages just large enough for   
 one hen,stacked several cages high in 
 closely packed rows,with just enough  
 room for a man to walk between the    
 rows. The hens are fed and watered    
 automatically. They consume about 100 
 tons of food per week, containing both
 imported and locally grown grain. The 
 hens produce about 2,000 cases of     
 eggs per week,each case containing 30 
 eggs. These are sold to a wholesaler, 
 who sells them mainly in the London   
 area.                                 
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
