		<title>05The school afternoon</title>
		<content>   We have two one-hour lessons with a 
 15 minute break at 2.30. We have      
{Art,Science,History,Geography,Music,  
{P.E.Games}and in the summer we also   
 have{Athletics and Swimming}in the    
 pool on the Infant site.We walk there 
 and back in a crocodile.              
   Because we are an{open plan school  
 with no classroom doors,the afternoons
 are often less quiet than the         
 mornings since we move around much    
 more to the{cookery area,craft and    
{science room}or the{library}where we  
 watch T.V.programmes often on{video.  
   We wear a{school uniform}of blue and
 grey with a silver stripe in our tie. 
 The uniform is not compulsory but most
 children wear it.                     
   At 3.45p.m. the bell rings and most 
 children go home on foot or by car but
 the unlucky bus children have to wait 
 as long as 30 minutes for their coach.</content>
