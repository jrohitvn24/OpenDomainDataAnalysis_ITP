		<title>06SUNDAY IN MARTIN MILL</title>
		<content> A typical Sunday by Andrea aged 9.    
 Mummy brings me orange juice when I   
 get up. Daddy goes to E.Langdon church
 where he is Churchwarden and I often  
 read a book like Snoopy. At 10.30am I 
 get dressed and Mummy gets my break_  
 fast of toast and tea. Daddy comes    
 back with Mary who takes the Sunday   
 School with the seven children who    
 meet at our house. We hear Bible      
 stories,pray,play games and sing      
 action songs. When they have gone we  
 have a Sunday dinner of chicken,roast 
 potatoes and vegetables with apple pie
 and cream to follow. Daddy washes up  
 and I bake pastry biscuits. In the    
 afternoon I go swimming with Mary at  
 St. Margaret's Country Club. After I  
 go to her house to play before we have
 baked potatoes for tea. When Daddy    
 takes me home I watch television      
 before bedtime at 8.30pm.             </content>
