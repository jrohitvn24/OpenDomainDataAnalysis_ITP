		<title>08WOODLAND AROUND FARLEY</title>
		<content> A great deal of Farley is woodland. In
 fact over the twelve square kilometre 
 block, five square kilometres is      
 woodland. Most of the woodland is     
 coniferous and has been planted. In   
 Bentley Wood the trees have been      
 planted by the Forestry Commission but
 now it belongs to a Trust, in order to
 conserve the wildlife.                
 Blackmoor Copse is ancient woodland   
 and belongs to the Wiltshire Nature   
 Conservancy. The wood was mentioned in
 the Domesday Book. It is the only area
 where the butterfly the Purple Emperor
 is protected. Farley and Brown's Copse
 are old woodlands. A great deal of    
 these woods are Hazel Coppice.        
 This is used to make hurdles, which   
 were originally used to keep sheep in.
 Pitton Copse and Great Netley Copse   
 are part of the Claredon Estate and   
 are privately planted.                </content>
