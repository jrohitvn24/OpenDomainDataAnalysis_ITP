 junior and infant school. We have 3

 links with the Church. We do a lot of 
 work with nature and have a pond, wild
 corner and animal house for rabbits   
 and guinea pigs. We send children on a
 lot of trips, with residential ones   
 for the top two years. We do all the  
 usual subjects with a lot of drama and
 music, putting on concerts during the 
 year. We have clubs for football,     
 matball, gymnastics, chess and        
 computers. The school has a happy
