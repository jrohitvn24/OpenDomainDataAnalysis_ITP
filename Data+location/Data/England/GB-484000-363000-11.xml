		<content> There are two good examples of        
 Medieval Dovecots in the village      
 indicating two large estates in the   
 past. The last estate was sold off in 
 1984.There are three farms the largest
 been of five hundred acres.           
 Mechanisation has reduced the number  
 of farm workes.Only our familys can   
 boast three generation still work on  
 the land.Many residents are relatively
 new to the village.Those people       
 entering the village are active or    
 retired professionals.This has further
 eroded the agriculturd population as  
 the newcomers buy up old property and 
 when renovated fetch high prices on   
 the property market.There is evidence 
 of a larger village once existed as   
 can be found with the foundation of   
 houses in ploughed fields.A number of 
 buildings are over five hundred years 
 old.                                  </content>
