Irchester Country Park lies to the     
south-east of Wellingborough.          
Originally it was an ironstone quarry  
and when it was worked out it was      
planted with trees originally Alder and
hazel but later coniferous trees such  
as Scots Pine and Larch. In 1971 it was
bought by the county council to be     
developed as a country park. The park  
today provides recreation space for    
many people living nearby and 414 000  
people visited the park in 1983. There 
are walks of different lengths and     
degrees of difficulty including a flat 
walk for the elderly or disabled. The  
park has marked nature trails for      
people to follow and has a toilet, room
for educational purposes and an office.
There are a large number of birds and  
animals using the park as a refuge     
including squirrels and some deer.     </content>
