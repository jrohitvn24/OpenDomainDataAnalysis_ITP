		<title>14Houses at Dedham</title>
		<content> When entering Dedham Road, a small    
 19th Century farm house built as a    
 Charity Farm is on the left. Forge    
 Cottage is a modern cottage bungalow  
 built in the late 1970's where the old
 forge used to be. Further on is the   
 Lodge, a 19th Century house, which is 
 a gatehouse to the Chase of Lawford   
 Hall. Sherbourne and Sherbourne       
 Cottage are next, both are thatched,  
 timber framed 17th Century cottages.  
 Both were originally designed for two 
 families. Sherbourne Cottage was the  
 miller's house. Sherbourne Mill is a  
 red brick Georgian House with a white 
 clapboard watermill and millpond at   
 the front of the  house. The watermill
 is built on the site of earlier mills 
 dating back to Saxon times. Opposite  
 Sherbourne Mill is Mill cottage built 
 in the early 1800's.
