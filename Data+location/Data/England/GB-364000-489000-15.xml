		<title>15A RURAL SITUATION</title>
		<content>      We are not really isolated, as   
 the few houses that are in our area   
 are close together.  Of the farms in  
 our one km square three belong to my  
 relatives and another family owns two 
 of the others.  Our house is on the   
 Dales Way so we see a lot of walkers  
 and cyclists.  On a 1 hour walk in our
 area we saw just three farmers        
 hay-timing, two farmworkers, one old  
 lady and two hikers.  The few cars    
 were a mixture of holiday traffic and 
 locals plus two council lorries and   
 the local policeman.  None of the     
 houses in our part of the Dale have   
 mains gas, mains water or mains       
 drainage.
