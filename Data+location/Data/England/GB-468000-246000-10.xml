    We carried out a survey to see     
 what the people in Towcester think    
 about a new by-pass, which is soon to 
 be built.                             
    Out of{30}people asked, they all   
 agreed that Towcester needed a        
 by-pass, for the following reasons:   
{   1.}There are too many traffic jams 
    at rush hours and during the       
    holiday season.                    
   {2.}Heavy lorries which are breaking
    up roads and causing damage to     
    buildings, need to be out of       
    Towcester.                         
  { 3.}There is a poor East-West trunk 
    road running through Towcester.    
                                       
 People said that a new road has only  
 become necessary in the last few years
 and they welcome the proposal.        </content>
