		<title>12LOOKING AFTER THE FARM</title>
		<content>       I live on a farm. Every morning 
 while the owners are away mum,Ben and 
 I get dressed. Then we go next door   
 and get the key from the shed.Then we 
 let the cat in the house,and put some 
 milk in a bowl on top of the deep     
 freeze so that the dog won't get it,  
 and put some cat food there as well.  
 After that we go to the stables. The  
 horses are not in there because they  
 are grass kept horses,but their food  
 is kept in there.This is some oats,hay
 and a bucket of water, which is put   
 into the oats.Then we put the feed    
 into large bowls,and throw the hay    
 into the field.Afterwards we feed the 
 chickens. We fill a bowl with grain   
 and throw it out on to the yard.Next  
 we collect the eggs from the hen      
 house.There are five egg boxes.One    
 hen is a broody hen,and we have a job 
 getting it off the eggs.              </content>
