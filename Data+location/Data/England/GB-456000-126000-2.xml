		<content> Our School opened for the first time  
 on January 17,1876 with 40 pupils.    
 110 years later in January 1986 60 of 
 us will leave the School temporarily  
 to allow extension and remodelling    
 work to be carried out.The old School 
 House will be incorporated in the     
 building and Mrs.North,our old school 
 caretaker will be rehoused near her   
 son.We are all very pleased that we   
 are having a new school as we might   
 have been shut and all of us would    
 have had to go to a bigger school on a
 bus.There was a big meeting in the    
 Village Hall about our School and all 
 the villagers said why they wanted to 
 keep our school.Some said the village 
 would lose its heart and the mum's    
 would not be able to talk to each     
 other at the beginning and end of the 
 day.
