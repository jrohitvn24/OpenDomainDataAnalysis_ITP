		<content> The Warton Division of British        
 Aerospace is Europe's most experienced
 combat aircraft research, development,
 production and flight-test            
 organisation. With the Jaguar and     
 Tornado aeroplanes it is spearheading 
 Great Britain's military project for  
 the latter part of the twentieth      
 century and beyond. The Warton        
 Division has been designing,          
 developing and building subsonic and  
 supersonic military aircraft since    
 1945. Since 1963, it has become a     
 world leader in the development of the
 of the variable-geometry wing. The    
 division employs approximately 16000  
 people, the majority coming from the  
 Fylde area. British Aerospace do not  
 provide a free transport service, but 
 do have an arrangement with Ribble    
 Motors to allocate fee paying buses in
 the mornings and at finishing times.  </content>
