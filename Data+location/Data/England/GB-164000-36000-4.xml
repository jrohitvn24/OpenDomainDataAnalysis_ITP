		<title>04TROON Cornwall - Employment</title>
		<content> This part of Cornwall is very largely 
 a farming community, the majority of  
 this being grazing land for livestock.
 Consequently employment in the area   
 is very scarce.                       
 The largest employer in the area is   
 the Pendarves Tin Mine, employing 60  
 people.  Owned by a subsidiary of Rio 
 Tinto Zinc it is the first new mine   
 shaft to be sunk in Cornwall this     
 century.                              
 In TROON village itself there are a   
 number of shops, all largely run as   
 family concerns, a primary school, a  
 taxi firm and Grenville's Bus Garage. 
 Of the remaining population few have  
 work as the unemployment in Cornwall  
 is higher than the national average.  
 Those who do work have to travel to   
 Camborne, Redruth and beyond to find  
 jobs.                                 
                                       </content>
