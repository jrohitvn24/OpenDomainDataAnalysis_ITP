Rolle &amp; the present Georgian mansion   
built by his sons.The gardens were laid
out in 1735 after plans by{LeNotre}who 
designed{Versailles.}An{obelisk}was    
added as a "point de vue" to the land- 
scape.In 1812 the lake was built by    
french prisoners.In 1850 a new StMary's
church was built &amp; later the Shell &amp;   
Orangery houses added.Finally,in 1908,
