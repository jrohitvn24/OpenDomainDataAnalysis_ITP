		<title>01Farm/Marshland Isle of Grain</title>
		<content> Area mainly consists of marshland     
 adjacent to sea. A yacht club is      
 raised in Colemouth Creek which is    
 also a favourite haven for anglers. A 
 particularly large type of lugworm is 
 found on mudflats to their delight. An
 oil distribution centre, a gas        
 stoppage installation &amp; a bitumen     
 producing plant with road &amp; rail      
 marshalling yards are the sole        
 industries, apart from farming. A     
 quarter of the area is arable         
 farmland. The main crops from which   
 are barley, oats &amp; wheat together with
 the occasional field of green         
 vegetables. Block engulfed by network 
 of fleets (local description for water
 filled ditches). Two thirds of the    
 land is littered with concrete        
 foundations from an extinct oil       
 refinery.
