		<title>06PRIDEWOOD HOP FARM ASHPERTON</title>
		<content> This farm grows the variety           
 'Goldings', which suits the soil and  
 sells well for the brewing of bitter  
 beer. During the hop growing season   
 the work is 'pegging', 'stringing',   
 'bracing', when two strings are tied  
 together for strength, 'tying', when  
 the hop shoots are twisted round the  
 strings, and 'picking' in September   
 when the strings are cut down and fed 
 through machines by casual workers    
 mainly from the Midlands. During the  
 hop growing season the hops are often 
 sprayed against 'mould' and 'mildew'  
 but the dreaded disease is 'wilt' for 
 which no cure has been found. It can  
 be carried by wind, birds or on       
 tractor tyres and the only remedy is  
 to clear the land. The price of hops  
 has fallen sharply from Â£450 a        
 'pocket' in 1980 to Â£150 in 1984.     
 (cause: German hops at lower price ?) </content>
