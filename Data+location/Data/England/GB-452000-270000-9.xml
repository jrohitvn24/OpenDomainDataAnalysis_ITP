		<title>09The Barn Shop</title>
		<content>   The Barn Shop is a shop in Barby    
 that sells Leather Clothes. The       
 building is about 216 years old. The  
 man who owns it has lived there for 8 
 years. The shop is a family business  
 and the man would like his children to
 carry on after him.                   
   The leather comes from London. All  
 the Sheepskin clothes are made at the 
 shop. You can watch him working. The  
 clothes seem very expensive but       
 apparently they are much cheaper than 
 in London because his overheads are so
 low by comparison.                    
   In the shop there are coats, hats,  
 gloves, slippers, jackets and belts.  
 It is possible to have things made to 
 measure. The man's name is Glyn       
 Roberts. The Barn Shop is very near   
 the park in Barby and is a good place 
 to go if you want to drive somewhere  
 different at the weekend.             </content>
