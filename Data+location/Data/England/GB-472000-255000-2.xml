{The Girls Uniform}                    
In summer we wear blue and white       
checked dresses,and in the winter we   
wear grey skirts,white shirts and navy 
jumpers or cardigans.                  
{The Boys Uniform}                     
All through winter the boys wear white 
or grey shirts,and in summer they can  
wear any colour shorts. Also in the    
winter they wear grey trousers.        
I think the school uniform is a bit    
boring,it could be a bit more modern.  
For example the girls jumpers and      
cardigans could have batwing sleeves   
and their skirts could be tight or     
mini,and for the boys uniform they     
could have jeans and in the summer wear
T-shirts
