		<title>10Our schools history</title>
		<content> Our school is called the Stanford     
 School,Laceby and it was founded      
 between the years 1720 and 1730.It was
 called the Stanford Charity School    
 because money was left in Philip and  
 Sarah Stanford's will to educate the  
 children of Laceby.Sarah and Philip   
 had three children of their own but   
 they all died in  infancy.The school  
 opened in 1730 and trustees were      
 appointed to ensure that the money    
 entrusted to the school was used      
 properly.The old log books show how   
 education has changed over the        
 years.The school provided secondary as
 well as primary education as children 
 left at 14.A new school was built     
 about 15 years ago up the road from   
 the old school.The trustees are still 
 very active.Each year the leavers are 
 presented with a bible or             
 dictionary.                           </content>
