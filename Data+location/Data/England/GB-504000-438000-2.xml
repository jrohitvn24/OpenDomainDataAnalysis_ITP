		<title>02St.Nicholas Church Beverley</title>
		<content> The vicar of St.Nicholas Church is    
 called Rev. Russell Dixon.  St.       
 Nicholas parish is the oldest parish  
 in Beverley, and it serves the area   
 east of the railway lines.            
 Originally the building was nearer to 
 the Beck, but it fell down in the     
 reign of Queen Anne.                  
      In the olden days this part of   
 Beverley was very busy,it was a       
 flourishing port.  Trade with the     
 Netherlands thrived and evidence      
 survives today in the form of         
 streetnames. Wealth created by        
 shipping made it possible for the     
 merchants to move to the north of     
 Beverley and provide the funds to     
 build the beautiful church of         
 St.Marys.
