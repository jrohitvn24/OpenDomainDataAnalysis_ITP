		<title>09THE WAKES CARNIVAL</title>
		<content> We all look forward to Wakes Week. It 
 starts on the last Saturday in June   
 with the carnival procession. This    
 year the weather was lovely. Everyone 
 who wanted, dressed up as something or
 someone to try to win a prize or just 
 for fun.                              
 There are different sections for      
 floats, animals and different         
 age-groups.                           
 I went as a member of the Parwich     
 cricket team. The Brownies went as a  
 set of dominoes.                      
 Our headmaster, Mr. Williams and his  
 wife were the judges. Cassie came     
 first in our section as a beautiful   
 butterfly and she won Â£1.00.          
 The Nottingham Caravan Club come to   
 Parwich every year for Wakes Week and 
 they enter the fancy dress. This year 
 they entered as nursery rhymes.
