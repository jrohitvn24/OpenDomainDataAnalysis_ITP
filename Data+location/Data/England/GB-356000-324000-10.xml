 The local community have an active    
 Village Hall Committee who meet once  
 monthly.  Present annual events are,  
 a bonfire night celebration held in   
 the grounds of one of the larger      
 houses, a Harvest Supper to coincide  
 with the local Church celebration, a  
 Whist Drive and SummerFayre.  More    
 frequently the Village Hall is used   
 for billiards competitions.  There are
 plans to form a Ladies Club also for  
 billiards.  It seems that all events  
 are well supported both by the local  
 population and also those from        
 outlying areas.   The major land owner
 provides the ground and facilities for
 regular cricket matches.  The team are
 presently playing in the Shropshire   
 League.  The newer members to the     
 village have formed a walking club    
 which invites other residents to join.</content>
