		<title>02BODIAM CASTLE</title>
		<content>    Bodiam Castle attracts an annual   
 average of 140 thousand visitors from 
 Britain and other countries throughout
 the world. Up to 20 thousand school   
 children visit this{ancient monument} 
 during the course of a year. The      
 castle, now 600 years old, with its   
 outside walls and towers virtually    
 intact, provides a useful background  
 for{filming}. Examples are some       
 episodes of "Dr. Who", and a programme
 in the "Watch" series on{television}; 
 as well as a pop video for Adam Ant   
 and a C.O.I. film about armour.       
    A vital part of the castle's       
 defence,the{moat}is a spring-filled   
 pond, so although it has been known to
 freeze over, it would not be safe to  
 walk on. At a cost of Â£1 for adults   
 and 50p for children the castle is    
 open to{invasion}every day except     
 Winter Sundays.                       </content>
