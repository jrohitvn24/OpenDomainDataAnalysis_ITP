		<content> C.S.P. stands for Cambridgeshire Salad
 Producers. It is supplied with lettuce
 by 30 local fulltime growers, who live
 on the Estate (now privately owned).  
 CSP sells lettuce (6 million boxes per
 annum), celery (216,000) &amp; tomatoes   
 (264,000). These are produced in about
 22 acres of glasshouses. The worst    
 time for CSP is when there is a good  
 harvest as the price goes down &amp; makes
 it harder to sell. Modern facilities  
 like vacuum coolers and insulation in 
 transport are used to that even on the
 hottest days lettuce &amp; other produce  
 is chilled. Major supermarkets are    
 regularly supplied by CSP, eg. Sains- 
 bury's, International, Gateway,       
 Budgens, Bishops, Key Markets &amp; London
 Co-ops. These markets supply the foll-
 owing areas where smaller shopkeepers 
 come &amp; buy: London, East Anglia,      
 Cardiff, Birmingham &amp; Leicester.      </content>
