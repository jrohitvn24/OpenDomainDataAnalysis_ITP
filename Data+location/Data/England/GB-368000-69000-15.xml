		<content> As Portland is an Island the most     
 obvious jobs would be those to do with
 the sea, i.e. fishing.  This is,      
 however, a relatively small employer  
 dealing mainly with crabs.  A lot of  
 employment is centred around the naval
 base or 'Dockyard' as it is known.    
 The next place of employment is the   
 Admiralty Research Establishment which
 deals with submarines and underwater  
 weapons.  Other forms of employment   
 include staff for both H.M.Prison and 
 the Youth Custody Centre.  There are  
 also general jobs such as shop        
 keepers, secretarial work, police,    
 etc.  The oldest and longest running  
 form of employment is working in the  
 quarries although this is now dying   
 out due to mechanisation and drop in  
 demand.
