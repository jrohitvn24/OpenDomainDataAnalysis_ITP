		<title>02Grove Farm</title>
		<content> The farm is situated in square 5 of   
 the data count grid. It was chosen as 
 being representative of many farms in 
 the area. However it does not have a  
 Dairy, Sheep or Market Gardening      
 element.                              
                                       
 The farm has 450 acres of land and is 
 owned by Mr Price. It is run by Mr    
 Price and his two brothers.           
                                       
 Mr Price raises cattle to sell for    
 meat and grows wheat to sell for      
 profit.
