		<title>02LAND USE AROUND MILDENHALL</title>
		<content> The Mildenhall area is a mainly       
 agricultural one. The region is split 
 across the middle by the{River Kennet 
 and the A4. In the extreme west is the
 edge of the town of Marlborough, and  
 there are villages along the road and 
 river at{Mildenhall}and{Axford.       
  To the south of the road and river   
 the land is quite hilly and is mainly 
 rough grassland used as permanent     
 pasture for sheep and cattle. This    
 leads up to{Savernake Forest,}which   
 just touches the south of our area.   
 This is a very ancient forest, though 
 the avenues of beech trees were       
 planted in the 18th century.          
  To the north of the road and river   
 and around Stitchcombe the land is    
 used for{arable farming}growing wheat 
 and barley, and for pasture. There are
 water_meadows along the river, and    
 there is a{trout farm}and a{vineyard. </content>
