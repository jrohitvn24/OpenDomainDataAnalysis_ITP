   The{Portway}is a track and a road   
 running along the crest of the        
{Longmynd.}It is a worn out path which 
 is now filled with pebbles in the     
 ground.It is a bumpy path and was     
 known as the{King's Highway}in the    
{Middle Ages.                          
   It is not known whether the Portway 
 was made by the{Romans}or by the      
 earlier people.                       
   On the track in the Southern part of
 the{Longmynd,}a lady called{Miss      
{Chitty}has traced thousands of pieces 
 of flint,used by early civilisations. 
   The{Celts}made{barrows,}which were  
 rounded burial grounds,and traces of  
 twenty-four of them have been found on
 the Portway.
