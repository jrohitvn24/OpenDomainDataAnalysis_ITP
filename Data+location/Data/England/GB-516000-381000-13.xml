		<title>13DAIRY FARM, EAST BARKWITH</title>
		<content>     One farm specialised in{milk      
 production. It was part of a larger   
 unit, and had no machinery except the 
 milking parlour. It had 58 acres of   
 rough{pasture,}and 60 acres of grass  
 for{silage.}This received a nitrogen  
 feed, and was cut by machinery from   
 one of the other farms. There was a   
 silo for the grass, which was not in  
 use. One stockman managed the 75{cows.
 In summer,the cows were out to pasture
 supplemented with cattle cake, and    
 each cow was expected to produce 20   
 litres milk per day. In winter, the   
 cows were kept in sheds and fed on    
 beet pulp, maize gluten, wheat and    
 silage to yield 12 litres milk per    
 cow per day. The cows were milked,12  
 at a time, in a herring-bone parlour. 
 Milk was cooled to 30C in a bulk tank,
 before collection by the Milk         
 Marketing Board tanker.               </content>
