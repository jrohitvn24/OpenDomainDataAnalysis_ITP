   The Nursery is situated on the busy 
 Lintzford Road about three quarters of
 a mile outside Rowlands Gill          
 village.It has been a nursery garden  
 for thirty-four years and consists of 
 three and a half acres of land with   
 four green-houses. The Nursery yields 
 a varying selection of bedding plants,
 such as primulas, marigolds, petunias,
 tagetes and many more, as well as     
 growing strawberries and raspberries  
 which are sold to the public on a     
 "pick your own" basis.                
   The Nursery has one full-time       
 employee and she is the wife of the   
 owner. The owner himself works        
 part-time at his Nursery Garden as    
 well as holding down a full-time job  
 elsewhere. They can earn about Â£120   
 per week. They lead a very busy life.
