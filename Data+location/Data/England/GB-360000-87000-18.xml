		<content>     Many summer visitors drive through
 this area to enjoy the  scenic  views.
 Most visit  Hardy's Monument which was
 built in 1844 as a viewpoint in memory
 of  Admiral Thomas Hardy who had lived
 in Portesham nearby.The monument is no
 longer safe enough to climb but a very
 extensive  panorama stretches in every
 direction  and  can be viewed from the
 unfenced car park at its base.The land
 owner  provides  this and   makes   no
 charge.  A  caravan   provides   light
 refreshments  there  in  summer.  Many
 tourists   park  their  cars  and  use
 footpaths  and  bridleways  which  are
 clearly  signposted  for  walking  and
 horseriding.    The South-West Coastal
 Path  which  runs  along  the Ridgeway
 is much used, especially from  Smitten
 Corner. Several houses provide bed and
 breakfast accommodation.
