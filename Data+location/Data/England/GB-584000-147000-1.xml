		<title>01 Around Ulcombe.</title>
		<content>                                       
 I've lived in Ulcombe about 9 years.  
 The best thing when you walk  out of  
 the door,is that you know beauty is   
 around you. The humming of the bees,  
 the sweet sound that the birds in the 
{beautiful green trees}make and the    
 most beautiful thing of all is the    
 smell of the country side.            
      There is mainly{farmland}rather  
 than roads. Crops grown are rape seed 
 ,barley,corn and wheat as well as     
 cherry and apple{orchards.}There are  
 also a lot of animals like horses and 
 dogs and also grazing land with sheep 
 and cows.One of the special features  
  is the lovely footpaths.             
      In spring there are beautiful    
 blossoms in the orchards;in summer the
 beautiful leaves and trees with the   
 wild flowers and the corn starting to 
 get high.                             </content>
