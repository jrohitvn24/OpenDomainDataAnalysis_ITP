		<title>02LIVING IN ENGLEFIELD GREEN</title>
		<content> When I moved in Englefield Green  in  
 1977 they were starting to build      
 Schroeder Court,where my mother works.
 There was'nt such thing as the Corby  
 Drive Estate.There are some of the    
 things that have changed.ST Jude's Rd 
 has been made bigger and they have    
 built the new estate.The old ST Judes 
 school has been pulled down and       
 Englefield Close has been built.The   
 laundrette has been made into two     
 shops and lots of roads have been     
 re_surfaced.Englefield Green is all on
 top of a hill.There is a gap between  
 us and Old Windsor and in that gap is 
 where the pop singer Elton John lives.
 Over the other side of Englefield     
 Green,down Wick Lane,there is the     
 entrance to the park.Which is near the
 Totem Pole and the Obelisk.
