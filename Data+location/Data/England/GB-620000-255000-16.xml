  As part of the Godspeed celebrations 
in 1985 a heritage trail was devised in
and around                             
 Otley .  Several important buildings  
were included in the trail. Otley Hall 
was naturally included and is detailed 
elsewhere.   On the route is High      
House this is a 16th century house     
held by the Gosnolds from 1572 to      
1615.                                  
Church House dates from 1540 .  It has 
an ornate beam said to be the rood-beam
ktaken from the church and which should
have been destroyed.  St Mary's Church 
is a small 13th century churc h.       
Netherhall, Otley Bottoms probably     
dating to the 15th century .
