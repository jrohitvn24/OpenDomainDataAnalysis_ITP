 CHIVERS FARM.                         
 Mr. Bascham has worked as area farm   
 manage at Chivers for 10 years .The   
 farms grow barley ,  cereal  fruit    
 plums apples pears peas and beans.    
  They harvest their fruit by hand     
 because apples bruise easily.They     
 plant their crops  in September.      
 He sprays the field every seven days  
 to keep theinsects from eating the    
 fruit. The area of farms has a        
 turnover of Â£1000000 per year.13 men  
 work fulltime on the farm.The soil is 
 clay it is the heaviest in the        
 country.He never waters the crops     
 because the ground retains water      
 easily.Chivers own 3000 acres . They  
 can store 3000 tons of fruit. Chivers 
 are helping conservation in the       
 Hardwick area by replanting woodland, 
 and laying new hedges.                </content>
