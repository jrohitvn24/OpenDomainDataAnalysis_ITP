		<title>17A Small School Survives.</title>
		<content>    There was a School at Langford but 
 it has closed.The children go to      
 school in Heybridge:2\ miles away.The 
 only school in our area is at Woodham 
 Walter.It has 28 pupils and 2         
 teachers. It is a catholic school and 
 this is the only reason it has        
 survived - some children from the     
 village go to school in Danbury. At   
 Woodham they have an assembly every   
 Wednesday and Friday.The rector comes 
 from the local church every two weeks 
 to give an RE lesson to the juniors.
