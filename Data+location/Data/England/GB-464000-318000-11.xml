		<title>11TRANSPORT _ RAGDALE AREA</title>
		<content> There is one major road in the Ragdale
 area.  That is the A46 Trunk Road,    
 from Leicester to Newark.  It is an   
 old Roman road, known as the Fosse    
 Way.  This road crosses the north_west
 corner of the area with a major       
 intersection at Six Hills, where the  
 B676, Loughborough to Melton Mowbray  
 road, passes underneath the A46.  A   
 bus service, operated by Bartons of   
 Nottingham, uses the A46 on its       
 journies between Nottingham and       
 Leicester.  It is a dual carriageway. 
 The A6006 crosses the north_east      
 corner of the Ragdale area on its way 
 between Loughborough and Melton       
 Mowbray.                              
                                       
 The road through Ragdale to Hoby is a 
 small country road which winds between
 hedgerows, following the undulated    
 contours of the land.                 </content>
