		<title>04The Ghost Of Tower Grange</title>
		<content> Trying to hide because of what I am,  
 Locked away from the outside world.   
 Will the Queen change her mind?       
 I wonder if the guards will find me.  
 I hear the call, to hide in my hole.  
 The moment I have been dreading...    
 The bolt on the door slides out of    
 place,                                
 The horrified look on my friend's face
 As the Queen's men slowly kill him,   
 For trying to hide me away from them, 
 I hide in a corner,                   
 They chain me up and leave me to die  
 and rot away,                         
 To haunt this place for ever.

{* Tower Grange,}built in 1350, is     
 reputed to have the ghost of a priest 
 who died in a priest hole in          
 Elizabethan times.                    </content>
