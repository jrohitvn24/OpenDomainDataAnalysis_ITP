		<title>07HOWLISH VIEW (Part 1)</title>
		<content> Howlish View is situated just off     
 Collingwood Street on the south side  
 of Coundon. The houses in our street  
 are terraced. Traffic in our street is
 very heavy. There are also lots of    
 cars parked down the side of our      
 street. There used to be an A.A. van  
 there but not any more. The people in 
 our street are really nice. There is  
 an old lady next door to us who is 86 
 and partially blind. On the other side
 is a teacher called Alyson Smith.     
 Further up the street live a few      
 strange people. One boy called Stuart 
 is really stupid. Down the street is a
 play field for the children. I play in
 there with Paul Eales. He is moving   
 soon. Recently we have had a new road 
 and pavement put in our street. It was
 really needed. The children in our    
 street sometimes have a game of "Red  
 Rover."                               </content>
