		<title>05THE POPULATION OF HASTINGS</title>
		<content>  The population of Hastings was about 
 1500 in the mid sixteenth century.    
 By 1861 it was 20,000. The rapid      
 growth of tourism after the growth of 
 rail communications resulted in a     
 population of 50,000 by 1891.By 1981  
 it was 75,000.                        
  The structure of the population is   
 unusual because the biggest age group 
 is between 60 and 69 because of the   
 town attraction to retired people.    
 There is a trend for people between 20
 and 39 to move away looking for better
 employment. This means the town has a 
 low birth rate.
