		<title>03INTERVIEW - BROWN FARM</title>
		<content>  In this area all the farms are of    
 roughly the same size _ between 80 and
 110 hectares . Brown Farm is          
 organic (they cannot use artificial   
 fertilisers and sprays) so all the    
 land is sown grass and intensively    
 cultivated.                           
 In this area sheep and beef cattle are
 reared. Brown Farm carries 100 head of
 cattle but the other farms in the area
 only have 20 or 30. Each farm also has
 about 200 sheep . Once a year         
 replacement calves and ewes are bought
 from the neighbouring farms.          
                                       
 Brown Farm is slightly unusual in that
 it raises dairy cattle for a farmer in
 the valley. This farm is run by the   
 family with very little outside help  
 and all the annual work (sheep        
 dipping, shearing etc.) is shared by  
 all the local farms.                  </content>
