		<title>17A SHROPSHIRE FARM - ENSDON</title>
		<content> A typical farm in this area is shown  
 on one of the photographs associated  
 with this block.  It lies just north  
 of the A5, near Ensdon.  It comprises 
 200 hectares, usually shared between  
 wheat, barley, potatoes, sugar beet   
 and pasture.  300 Friesian cattle are 
 kept, 150 milkers and 150 growing     
 calves.  There are also 50 beef       
 cattle.                               
 The family have farmed here for       
 generations.  There are 5 men working 
 on the farm which is equipped with    
 four tractors, a combine harvester and
 a considerable amount of associated   
 machinery.  A large grain drier and   
 grain store has been installed on the 
 farm to enable harvesting to continue 
 in difficult weather conditions.  This
 was put to considerable use during the
 cool, wet summer of 1985 when this    
 data was collected.                   </content>
