		<content> We surveyed the houses of the children
 of Knebworth School and received 157  
 replies. Three replies came from      
 elsewhere so have been discounted. We 
 asked the question "Where does the    
 main wage earner in your family work?"
 Here are the results of our survey:   
     Knebworth      {17                
     Stevenage      {17                
     London         {38                
     Hatfield       { 8                
     Welwyn         {22                
     Hertford       { 2                
     Elsewhere      {45                
 The single most popular place for work
 is London. Not many people work in    
 Knebworth itself. Knebworth is what   
 you call a dormitory village. Its good
 road and rail links make it ideal for 
 people who want to live in a pleasant 
 village and yet be close to centres of
 work.                                 </content>
