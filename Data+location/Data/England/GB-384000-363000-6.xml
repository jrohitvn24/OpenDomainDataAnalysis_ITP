		<title>06Congleton Cattle Market</title>
		<content>    It was opened in September 1964 on 
 a site in the middle of town which is 
 now occupied by the Police Station.   
 It was moved in 1966 to its present   
 site.                                 
    The{Cattle Market}is open Tuesdays 
 only and the auctioneers and          
 proprietors are Whittaker and Biggs.  
 At 10.30am. cows are auctioned,       
 12.30pm. bulls and sheep and at       
 1.00pm. beef cattle are auctioned.    
    On average 250 sheep and 400 cattle
 are sold every week but this does vary
 with the time of the year.            
    Most of the buyers and sellers come
 from an area within 30 miles but some 
 do come from other parts of this      
 country and Europe.                   
    During the rest of the week the    
 Market is used as a bus depot and as a
 storage place for continental lorries.
