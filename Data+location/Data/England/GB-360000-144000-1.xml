 Shepton Mallet "North" is similar     
 in most respects to areas in it's     
 immediate vicinity.                   
 It consists for the most part of      
 gently undulating countryside, roughly
 200 meters above sea-level,rising to a
 maximum height of 297 meters.         
      The soil is slightly acidic and  
 rather sandy. The underlying rock is  
 limestone.                            
      The buildings are of local stone 
 i.e. limestone.                       
      The main landuse is dairy farming
 with a small area of deciduous forest.
      The rest of the land is occupied 
 mainly by residential cottages.       
      There is a radio mast in this    
 area which is used by the water       
 authority to alter the flow of piped  
 water underground.
