		<title>20KIDSGROVE OPEN AIR MARKET</title>
		<content>  We visited Kidsgrove market on       
Tuesday June 11 1985. It is held weekly
and there are 20 stalls,making it quite
a small market .There are 4 food stalls
a sweat stall and 5 for clothes. All   
the stallholders go to other markets.  
  80% of the people who visited the    
market lived less than 3 miles away so 
most walked there. A third came by car.
On the day we visited, nearly 2\3 of   
the people interviewed had come to buy 
a definite article and 61% came        
regularly; most to buy food.           
  Over half of the visitors thought the
market was very good but being open air
when it rains there would not be as    
many people. The better the weather,   
the more customers they get.
