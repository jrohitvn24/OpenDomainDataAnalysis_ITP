		<title>16A View From The Water.</title>
		<content> When we go out in my dad's boat we    
 usually launch from the slipway near  
 the{Itchen Bridge and Thornycroft     
 Shipyard.We sail down river past the  
 sewage works then we steer to port    
 towards{Weston}Shore.We have to be    
 careful at this point because at low  
 tide we could get stuck in the        
 mudflats.Behind Weston Shore stand six
 tower blocks,Havre,Oslo,Copenhagen,   
 Rotterdam,Hampton and Canberra.       
 Across the Southampton Water I can see
 Fawley Oil Refinery and Marchwood     
 Power Station.We have to watch out for
 the many clam dredgers and the        
 occasional hydrofoil or ferry but most
 of the traffic is yachting.           
 Further along the shore we can see    
 Netley castle amongst the trees and   
 Weston sailing club.Sometimes it is   
 difficult to sail through the racing  
 fleets.                               </content>
