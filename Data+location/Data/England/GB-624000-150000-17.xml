		<title>17GAMES CHILDREN PLAY.</title>
		<content>  These are some of the games we play  
 in our school playground during       
 playtimes. Some of them are           
 traditional games and some of them are
 made up.                              
{DIZZY LAND                            
  You spin around in circles with your 
 arms outstretched and you bump into   
 each other and fall over. It is best  
 to play this on the grass.            
{LEAPFROG                              
{ }One person bends over and the others
 jump over the person like a frog. The 
 person bending over gets higher and   
 higher until no one can jump it and   
 then some one else is on.             
{BUDGE                                 
{ }In this game one person is "he" and 
 he has to catch the others.Some things
 like the bench or the drainpipe are   
 home. If another person runs to your  
 "home" you have to budge and run away.</content>
