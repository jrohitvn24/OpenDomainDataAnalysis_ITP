		<title>02WEETING VILLAGE  1</title>
		<content> The village is split by the B1106, the
 Brandon-Stoke Ferry road going N.S.,  
 and a minor road on the alignment of  
 the Old Drove Road (Hockwold to Roud- 
 ham Heath).The latter becomes a foot- 
 path only through part of the village 
 so motorists have to drive round three
 sides of a rectangle to regain the    
 alignment.                            
 The one public house and only garage  
 which also sells cars are on the B1106
 and 4 of the shops are near there on a
 broad concrete road left over from the
 2nd World War.The fifth shop is a gen-
 eral store and Post Office at the     
 cross roads of the B1106 and the Drove
 Road.The shops include a D.I.Y.cum    
 garden centre and a small haberdashers
 the other two shops are grocery       
 stores.
