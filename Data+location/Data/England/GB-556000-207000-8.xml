		<title>08Biography Mr. Adlam</title>
		<content> Mr. Adlam is a well known local man   
 who is a mine of information on a     
 range of subjects.   His family have  
 lived in Fyfield for seventy years.   
 They came from Elstead in Sussex.  Mr.
 Adlam likes Fyfield because of the    
 nature of the countryside.   There are
 plenty of hedges, trees and wildlife. 
  Mr. Adlam has owned, and his father  
 before him, a nursery.   He has done  
 many jobs including being a plant     
 inspector for Marks and Spencer.  Mr. 
 Adlam is able to identify the Fyfield 
 Pea and lists it as his favourite     
 flower.   Mr. and Mrs. Adlam live in a
 bungalow which they have built        
 themselves.  Moorhens, Reed Warblers, 
 Kestrel, partridges, pheasants and    
 Magpies visit their garden.   There is
 a garden pond in which live frogs,    
 newts, tadpoles, water boatmen and    
 freshwater shrimps.                   </content>
