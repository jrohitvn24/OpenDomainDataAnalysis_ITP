		<content> There are two shops open in the       
 village throughout the year, one of   
 which is a general food shop, selling 
 meat, groceries, greengroceries, etc. 
 The other is a more general store,    
 selling, in addition to food, clothing
 and a variety of other goods.         
 During the tourist season two         
 additional shops are open. These, in  
 general, cater for the visitors,      
 selling souvenirs, pottery, trinkets, 
 items of art and craft and other      
 knick-knacks beloved of tourists and  
 holiday makers.                       
 There is a small post office, a public
 house and a number of licensed        
 restaurants, all of which are open    
 throughout the year. The nearest      
 garage and petrol filling station is  
 at Zoar, some two miles from the      
 village.
