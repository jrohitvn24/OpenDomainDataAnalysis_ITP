When Mr.Barker was young there were    
small farms around the area.Few people 
lived in Boney Hay though there were   
more living in Chasetown.There were two
sandholes(one where the school is now).
On the nearby common there were no     
buildings.The war did not affect Boney 
Hay,though men who were not miners were
sent to  war.                          
  In the 1940s and 1950s the two main  
mines were closed.The area was         
dirty through  mine chimnies.          
  People shoped at Chasetown,Cannock or
Lichfield.There was only a Co-op at    
Sankey's corner.                       
  Vehicles were coal carts,police were 
on bicycles and a doctor and a farmer  
had a car.The colliery had a football  
team and a brass band.                 
  Spare time  was spent at the local   
public house or playing bowls.         </content>
