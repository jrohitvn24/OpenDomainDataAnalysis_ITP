 We went down to Freshwater Bay and    
 interviewed some tourists.  Here are  
 some of the answers they gave us.     
 They lived in  London and were over   
 here for a holiday they were staying  
 in a hotel in Sandown.  They came to  
 the Island because they enjoy it, they
 don't dislike anything over here      
 except the wind and rain.  They got   
 over here by train, ferry and bus.    
 She came over with her husband.  They 
 liked the beauty of the country-side  
 and the beaches.                      
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
