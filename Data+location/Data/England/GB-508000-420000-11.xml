		<title>11MEMORIAL HALL USERS CONT.</title>
		<content> Goxhill Amateur Players meet on the   
 first Wednesday of each month in one  
 of the side rooms of the Memorial     
 Hall. They stage two productions each 
 year on the Hall's stage and rehearse 
 for periods of 7 weeks twice a year on
 Monday and Wednesday evenings and     
 Sunday afternoons.                    
 The Memorial Hall has a number of     
 occasional users. Lincolnshire and    
 Humberside Arts use the premises for  
 some of their shows / exhibitions.    
 Magic shows are held from time to time
 whilst touring pantomimes and light   
 orchestral music are also occasionally
 amongst the Hall's attractions. Trade 
 shows and sales e.g. carpets, are also
 held there. Dog shows and cage bird   
 shows are also annual activities which
 does not leave much time available for
 village bazaars, barbecues, social and
 fund raising activities.              </content>
