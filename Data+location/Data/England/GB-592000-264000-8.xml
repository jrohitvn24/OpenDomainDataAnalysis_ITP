  ONE FAMILY'S DAY:ON THE FLOAT        
                                       
  It was time to meet the Float,which  
looked very colourful.We climbed aboard
and soon set off.We waved to the crowds
and some of the children played        
tambourines and other instruments.     
  Everyone came out to watch.The worst 
part was getting onto,and travelling   
across, the playingfield.It was like   
being in a small boat in high seas.    
  The Floats were then judged;we were  
delighted to win 1st prize.The Press   
photographer took pictures which later 
appeared in the local papers.          
  At 4 o'clock we returned home,with   
two complaining clowns who had to walk.
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
