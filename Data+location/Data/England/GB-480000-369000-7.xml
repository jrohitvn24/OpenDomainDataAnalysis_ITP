 the village in the latter part of the 
 19th Century.Before it became a       
 Nursing Home it had been a Children's 
 Home.Extensive alterations had to be  
 made to the building to make it       
 suitable for a nursing home including

 patients communication system.The Home
 provides mostly convalescent
