		<content> Our road is called Robin Lane (by     
 Georgina Burns,aged 9).Until 1923 it  
 was a rough unmade lane.It was twice  
 the width it is today with thick high 
 hedges either side and beyond these,  
 fields and a pond.There was only      
 one house ,which was the Lodge(it was 
 on the edge of the Elton family       
 estate.)Behind the hedge there was a  
 large pond where our front lawn (and  
 that of our neighbour's) is situated. 
 Although filled in when development   
 took place ,both lawns have a         
 noticeable slope towards each other.  
 This pond was soon called by local    
 people "Postman's Pond"...because a   
 postman was found dead in it ,with all
 his letters floating around him!There 
 are still people alive who remember   
 this but no_one really knew what      
 happened.                             
 Our house was built in !930.          </content>
