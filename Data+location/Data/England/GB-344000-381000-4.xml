		<content>{LANDSCAPE}The general landscape is one
 of a large housing estate{Speke}which 
 has been built on a various types of  
 land cover such as farmland, woodland 
 and heath. The estate spreads and     
 stretches towards the village of{Hale,
 which is generally open farmland and  
 now has two small housing estates.    
 By{May 1985}there are no sheep or     
 cattle, some pigs are now being kept, 
 the fields forming arable land with   
 grain, and root crops with some bulbs 
 and flowers.                          
 Scattered among the fields can be seen
 the remains of some of the woods and  
 plantations. Three percent of the land
 is within the tidal flow and is now   
 subject to casual marsh, although the 
 drainage is now being improved.       
 The River section contains polluted   
 sands and eroding mudbanks.
