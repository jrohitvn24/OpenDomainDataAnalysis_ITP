		<title>18THE COMMUNITY</title>
		<content> There are a few local societies that  
 cover our area.                       
 The Women's Institute have branches   
 that cover part of the area and they  
 meet monthly.                         
 For the elderly the Sithney Over      
 Sixties offer meetings and outings but
 this organisation only covers a small 
 part of our area.                     
 The churches offer a meeting place as 
 well as occasional social activities. 
 Sithney C.P. School has just become   
 part of the County Council's Community
 Schools Programme which encourages the
 use of the school premises by all     
 sections of the Community. The aim of 
 the Programme is to make the school a 
 centre for community life.
