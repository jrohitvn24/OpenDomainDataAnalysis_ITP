		<content> From the time of the{Domesday Book    
 until the beginning of the twentieth  
 century the population of Thurnscoe   
 has remained approximately the same.  
 Records show that there were only{217 
 people in Thurnscoe up until the time 
 of the opening of Hickleton Main      
 Colliery.                             
 After the opening of the pit the      
 population increased dramatically by  
 over a thousand. It continued to      
 increase because of the coal industry 
 for many years.                       
 The{Census of 1981}showed the most    
 recent population count this total    
 was{11,445.}These figures also show   
 that the population has{declined      
 between 1971 and 1981 by{11%} This can
 be accounted for by the reduction in  
 coalmining since 1977 at Hickleton.   
 Also by reduction in employment at    
 connected industries in the area.     </content>
