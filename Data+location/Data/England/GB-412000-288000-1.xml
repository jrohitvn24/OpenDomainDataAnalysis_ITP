		<title>01...THE GENERAL PICTURE.</title>
		<content>  This is a mainly residential area,   
developed since the second World War.  
Industrial development is mainly       
confined to the area North of the M6   
motorway which bisects the 12 squares. 
  There are many trees and open areas  
with some high rise development.       
  The area is well served by local     
transport, and shops cater for most day
to day needs.                          
  Levels of unemployment are high with 
the attendant social problems this     
brings.                                
  The county boundary of North Warwick-
shire and Birmingham passes through the
N.E. of the area and there has been    
recent property development for the    
private sector.                        
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
