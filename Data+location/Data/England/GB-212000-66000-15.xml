		<title>15PLAYGROUND GAMES</title>
		<content> Two of the most popular games we play 
 are{"Grandmother's Footsteps"}:one    
 person in the game turns their back on
 the others who stand about 5m away.The
 object of the game is to touch that   
 person who keeps turning round quickly
 without them seeing you move.Anyone   
 seen moving goes back to the start.The
 first person to touch is the next     
 on."Simon Says":-One person is        
 Simon.He tells you to do different    
 things by saying "Simon says do       
 this"and you must copy him.If he tells
 you to do something without saying    
 "Simon says"then you must not do it or
 you are out.Other games we play       
 are:Bulldog,Run away children, Polo,  
 Cops &amp; robbers, Marbles, Chain tig,   
 Hopscotch and Skipping.One of my      
 favourite games is called "Murder     
 Mysteries".
