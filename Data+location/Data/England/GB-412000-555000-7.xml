		<content>    The second section, known as       
 'Palette wood' because it is used to  
 make palettes for storage purposes in 
 warehouses, goes to a Willington, in  
 Durham, firm. The top section of the  
 tree is pulped down and pressed  into 
 chipboard to make bathroom, kitchen   
 and bedroom furniture.                
    Today many European and            
 Scandinavian forests suffer from acid 
 rain pollution. This was not          
 Chopwell's problem. Its pollution came
 from Consett's Iron Works which are   
 now closed so this is no longer a     
 problem.                              
    We enjoyed our visit to the woods. 
 We were shown how to use all five of  
 our senses to the best advantage. We  
 hope these woodlands continue to      
 support the wildlife of the area as   
 well as being beneficial to mankind   
 for many years to come.               </content>
