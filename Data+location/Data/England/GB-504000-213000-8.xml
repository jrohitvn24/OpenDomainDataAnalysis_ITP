		<title>08THE GREY LADY</title>
		<content> There are two ghost stories about a   
 ghost called 'The Grey Lady'.The first
 is that the ghost is a nun from the   
 dissolved nunnery of St. Giles in the 
 wood of which no trace now remains.It 
 is true that several nuns were found  
 buried in the front lawn.She is said  
 to be one of these nuns who haunts the
 ground around her burial place.       
 The second story is that she is the   
 ghost of a servant at the Sebright's  
 home.Accused of a crime,the maid had  
 been sentenced to death.Faced with a  
 hanging she threw herself into the    
 workings of the clock tower and this  
 awful death causes her spirit to      
 wander about what is now Beechwood    
 Park School.                          
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
