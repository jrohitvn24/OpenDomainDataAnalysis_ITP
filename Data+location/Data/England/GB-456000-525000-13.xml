		<content> Coatham has a tremendous number of    
 recreation and leisure facilities.    
                                       
 In recent years the swimming baths    
 have been rebuilt. The Council        
 has also built a Sports/Leisure       
 Centre opposite the baths. There are a
 uariety of activities available e.g.  
 Squash, Badminton and Weight Training.
 Nearby there is a Golf Course, a new  
 BMX Track and a Boating Lake.         
                                       
 The Redcar Bowl is used for Concerts  
 and Competitions. The British Darts   
 Championship has been held there for  
 the past two years.                   
                                       
 There is also an indoor Amusement Park
 which is very popular in the summer.  
                                       
 All these facilities are within five  
 minutes walk of each other.           </content>
