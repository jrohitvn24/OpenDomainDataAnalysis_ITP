		<content> Little Brington is a small village six
 miles west of Northampton.   An old   
 Roman road passes east to west through
 Nobottle and south of Little Brington 
 along the ridge of hills to Daventry. 
 The rural nature of the area, which is
 largely devoted to mixed farming, has 
 been maintained because it has been   
 part of the estate of Earl Spencer of 
 Althorp since the 16th century.       
 However, only a small minority if its 
 population of 250 is now employed     
 locally.   Nobottle remains remains a 
 hamlet of old stone houses but half of
 the houses in Little Brington have    
 been built since 1945.   Many         
 residents are retired or commute to   
 work in neighbouring towns.           
 Prominent landmarks are the           
 Electricity Board's Supergrid pylons  
 which cross the area from north to    
 south and the spire of St. John's     </content>
