  Sir John Offley C.E.(C) Primary      
School is a co-educational day school  
administered by the county of Stafford-
shire. Children between the ages of 5  
and 11 go to the school, and most      
pupils then transfer to Madeley High   
School about half a mile away.         
  There are eight classes, each with   
its own teacher. The school has about  
240 pupils. In the infant classes, the 
children enjoy learning to read, write 
and start doing maths. They also talk  
to their teachers and to each other a  
lot, learning how to speak clearly and 
with confidence. In the afternoons,    
they do lots of different activities   
like painting, modelling in plasticene,
doing jigsaws, sewing, etc. The older  
children in the juniors do science,    
history, geography and project work.   
Many children play musical instruments.</content>
