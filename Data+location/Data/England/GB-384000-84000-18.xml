		<content> No two days in the life of a Vicar are
 the same, so the day I describe       
 happened only once.                   
 Ascension Day started in sunshine; I  
 unlocked the church, said the morning 
 prayer, and came down to school; three
 hymns at assembly and everyone awake, 
 but some couldn't count! Back to      
 church, singing to myself on the way, 
 for Communion, and the baptism of     
 a grownup.                            
 She was nervous, but had many friends 
 in support.                           
 After which,away to Weymouth for a    
 cremation - a cloud came over, and    
 went; home for lunch, which my wife   
 always has ready - I washed up ,dried 
 and had a quick cuppa, then out on my 
 visits.                               
 Many like to come to church on        
 Ascension Day, so back again to       
 church. Hurrah!No meeting tonight.    </content>
