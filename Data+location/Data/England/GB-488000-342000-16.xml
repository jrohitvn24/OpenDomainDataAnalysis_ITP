		<title>16THE VILLAGE SCHOOL</title>
		<content> Situated in the centre of Marston, the
 village school caters for the primary 
 children of both villages.  The old   
 school was held in the church vestry  
 at Marston founded in 1716.  The      
 present school was erected in 1861 and
 is aided by the Church of England.    
 The children used to sit in rows but  
 now they sit in groups, occasionally  
 having lessons outside on sunny days. 
 Children are taught in two classes, 4 
 - 7 and 7 - 11 yrs.                   
 The school has a football team and the
 children go swimming every week in    
 Grantham.                             
 The school kitchens are now unused and
 the children have to bring packed     
 lunches.                              
 The building although old is light and
 warm having central heating.  There is
 a hardcore playground and a playing   
 field with running track and sand pit.</content>
