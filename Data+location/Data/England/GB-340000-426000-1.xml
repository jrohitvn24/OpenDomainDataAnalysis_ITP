		<title>01WARTON AND FRECKLETON</title>
		<content> Both the villages of Warton and       
 Freckleton were mentioned in the      
 original Domesday Book. Quote -       
 "Freckulton consists of four carucates
 of laid and arable soil". Warton and  
 Freckleton lie along the main road    
 connecting the town of Preston to the 
 east and the seaside resort of Lytham 
 to the west. The older houses follow  
 the main road, but there has been a   
 lot of building over the past twenty  
 years and housing estates now spread  
 away from the road. Freckleton used to
 be a small fishing village and still  
 has its boatyard on the Ribble estuary
 which dominates the southern part of  
 our area. The main employer in our    
 area is British Aerospace. This       
 military airfield covers a great part 
 of the Warton area. It is used for    
 testing military aircraft notably the 
 Tornado.This makes the area very noisy</content>
