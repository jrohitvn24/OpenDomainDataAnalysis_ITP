		<title>05HORSE RIDING AT YORK.</title>
		<content> Monday and Friday are riding nights at
 York.  Monday is club night.  At the  
 club the Major lets us use his horse  
 and the stadium.  The first thing is  
 to brush the horses down.  This is to 
 get all the mud and dust off after    
 they have been rolling in the fields. 
 Next we put on their saddles and      
 bridles.  Then we take them into the  
 stadium.  As soon as they are in, we  
 have to tighten the girths and        
 lengthen the stirrups.  Then it's hop 
 on the horse and trot off.            
 Sometimes we jump, sometimes we do    
 road safety, that is boring.  The best
 thing on a Monday is all of us        
 cantering round, even 30year old      
 Snowy.  After one hour it's dismount  
 and lead out to the courtyard, then   
 unsaddle them.  We take them to the   
 fields.   Friday night is the same but
 Major Cole teaches us. Nicola Williams</content>
