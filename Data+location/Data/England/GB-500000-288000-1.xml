		<title>01Life in old Glapthorn</title>
		<content>Glapthorn was much smaller in the olden
days.   The roads were stony and       
people got around by horse and cart.   
There was only one shop at the top     
of Glapthorn.  There were two pubs in  
Glapthorn.   A fair came every year.   
Mrs. Wilkinson a farmer's wife gave    
everybody a feast at Christmas and     
Easter.  There was only one Church and 
Chapel.   The village has changed a lot
so has the School.   The water came    
from a well at the Pub.   There was a  
Blacksmiths and a Wheelwright.   There 
has been a lot of houses built.   The  
swimming pool in Oundle was built in   
1939 and the roof was put on in 1976.  
People cooked with a stove over fire,  
there was no electricity and the drains
were terrible.
