		<content>For breakfast I have 'Start', a cereal 
with honey. I leave home at 8.45am as  
the school whistle goes at 9.00am. If I
have time before school I watch        
Breakfast TV. A few years ago there was
no such programme. Now 2 channels show 
it. Altogether we have 4 channels. Our 
class has 25 children and nearly half  
have video recorders. We have register 
first then up to Assembly where we all 
gather together to sing and hear       
stories. We usually have maths until   
playtime. Playtime lasts for 15 mins.  
We are allowed to bring crisps or      
biscuits to eat. In the playground many
games are played-football, hopscotch,  
leapfrog, hom-pom or red rover. In the 
latter there are 2 teams, one making a 
wall by holding hands. A membere of the
other team has to break through. After 
play we do written work. Our lunchbreak
is from 12.00 to 1.30pm.               </content>
