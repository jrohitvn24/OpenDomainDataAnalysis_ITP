		<title>03Muness Castle,Uyeasound.</title>
		<content> To get to Muness Castle you need to   
 travel 3 kilometres east from         
 Uyeasound Village. It was built in    
 1598 by Laurence Bruce when he came to
 Uyeasound after being involved in a   
 murderous squabble.                   
   Today Muness Castle is a ruin.The   
 roof has gone and so has the third    
 floor.When people lived in the castle 
 there was a forest below the castle.  
 This is known because tree bark has   
 been found in the peat bogs.          
   The Custodian of the castle was     
 asked some questions.She has a        
 visitors' book and last year three and
 a half thousand people visited the    
 castle.The Custodian also shows people
 around the castle,sells leaflets,keeps
 the castle tidy and cuts the grass.
