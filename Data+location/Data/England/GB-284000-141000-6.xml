		<content> The Exmoor stags cast their antlers   
 every Spring. A good set of antlers   
 can sometimes be picked up in rough   
 combes or in the woods. One farmer has
 over several years found antlers      
 always in the same spot near his farm,
 and from a distinctive malformation he
 has established that the same stag    
 chooses the same spot every year to   
 rid himself of the old head. On this  
 same farm a hind comes regularly to a 
 slope of bracken and hawthorns to have
 her calf. These two examples might    
 help conservationists to keep a       
 protective eye on the Red Deer.
