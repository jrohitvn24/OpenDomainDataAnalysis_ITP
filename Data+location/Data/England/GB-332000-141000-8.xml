		<title>08THE LOCAL ESTATE AGENTS</title>
		<content>   On the 25th of June Mr Wiscom came  
 into our school to talk to us about   
 his job.We asked him some questions   
 and he kindly answered them for us.   
 He told us that he was his own boss   
 and that his{business}is expanding. He
 is taking on a full time seller and a 
 secretary.Mr Wiscom shares a property 
 in Bridgwater and a home and business 
 in Jersey.The premises has been used  
 for a variety of purposes in the past 
 including a "fencing and sword shop". 
   Mr Wiscom also is an agent for the  
{Alliance building}Society.The cheapest
 house he has ever sold is Â£15,000,and 
 the dearest is Â£180,000.Mr Wiscom     
 enjoys his job and at the moment has  
 an assistant called Mr Lovett.        
 " I think being an{estate agent}would 
 be a very interesting job because you 
 dont have to sit around all day."
