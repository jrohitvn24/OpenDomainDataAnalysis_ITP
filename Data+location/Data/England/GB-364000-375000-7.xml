		<title>07LION SALT WORKS Est.1842.</title>
		<content> The Works was founded 143 years ago in
 Marston by the Thompson family who    
 still own the works today. Brine was  
 pumped out of the ground by a beam    
 pump known  as a "nodding donkey". It 
 was put into huge salt pans fired by  
 coal. As the brine evaporated, salt   
 crystals formed on the surface,       
 increased in weight and size and fell 
 to the bottom. Size and weight were   
 controlled by varying the temperature 
 of the brine. The salt was raked to   
 the side of the pan and was shovelled 
 into Peg Top tubs. It was compressed  
 by a Mundler to obtain the required   
 weight per tub. After the salt had    
 been drained it was taken to the hot  
 house for drying. The Thompson family 
 still operate the firm today using    
 traditional methods. They are now the 
 only open pan block salt makers in the
 world and are a tourist attraction.   </content>
