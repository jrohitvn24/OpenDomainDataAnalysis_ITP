		<title>14WOODVILLE NURSERIES</title>
		<content> Woodville Nurseries was built at the  
 turn of the century, and still has the
 original gates. They sell baskets of  
 flowers,bouquets and cable orders to  
 countries all over the world. They do 
 a lot of weddings, funerals and       
 christenings.                         
 The greenhouses are joined together   
 in rows. They have 9 workers , 7 full 
 time, and 2 part time. The people who 
 work there do not wear a special      
 uniform. The only machines they use   
 are hedge trimmers and rotovators.    
 They use fresh manure as fertiliser.  
 They have an original white rose that 
 is still climbing up a wall. It       
 belonged to the first owners. The     
 nurseries specialise in               
 chrysanthemums. The rarest and most   
 expensive flowers they sell are       
 orchids. Daffodils are most popular   
 from Christmas to Easter.             </content>
