		<content>       Samantha and I interviewed Mr   
 Darby about a normal day in his life. 
 He has cereal or toast for breakfast. 
 After breakfast he goes for a walk.He 
 has dinner at 12,00.After dinner he   
 sits down.Then he goes round the      
 fields with a gun and shoots squirrels
 and rabbits.Then he has tea at 4,00.  
 After tea he feeds the pheasants. Then
 he goes in and sits down then he does 
 some work in his garden.When he comes 
 in he watches some T.V. and then goes 
 to bed.                               
        On a Monday morning I get up,  
 get washed and dressed and have       
 breakfast, which is Weetabix or       
 Frosties.Dad then takes me to school. 
 At 9,00 a.m. we go into school for    
 assembley.Our morning subjects are    
 maths and English.Lunch is at 12      
 noon.In the afternoon we have creative
 studies and sport.                    </content>
