		<title>02INTRODUCTION SWANAGE</title>
		<content>   The days when Swanage was noted for 
 its building and contracting firms    
 which employed 100's of skilled men   
 are sadly gone. The industry now      
 employs few and farming even fewer.   
   The discovery of considerable       
 resources of oil nearby, and the      
 expansion of the ball clay industry   
 give some scope for employment but    
 this is limited as far as Swanage is  
 concerned.                            
   It is hoped that the pier will be   
 brought back into use, together with  
 a marina for better yachting          
 facilities. The dedicated work of the 
 railway enthusiasts are creating an   
 undoubted attraction for a large body 
 of visitors. This goes to show that   
 the future of the town lies squarely  
 in tourism now and even more in the   
 future.                               
                                       </content>
