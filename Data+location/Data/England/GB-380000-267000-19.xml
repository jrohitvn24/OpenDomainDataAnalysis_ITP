		<title>19Fishing in the Severn.</title>
		<content> by Ann Hill                           
 Since the introduction of holding     
 reservoirs lower down the Severn the  
 life of fish has been affected .Water 
 released from the bottom of dams is   
 colder than the river temperature     
 causing fish to  feed less avidly than
 normal in warmer weather.The          
 introduction of barbel which find the 
 fast stream water much to their       
 liking,into the river the early 60's  
 has caused a fluctuation in the       
 density of fish resident in the river 
 at Stourport.Barbel have pushed the   
 Dace and Chub once caught in their    
 thousands off their traditional       
 spawning grounds.Those that do spawn  
 suffer from  loss of eggs by being    
 disturbed or eaten by the barbel.     
 Fishing is a sport enjoyed by people  
 of all ages.
