  Safety is of a great importance.     
 Meetings are held once a month to     
 check and discuss all aspects.This    
 includes vehicles driven around the   
 site,delivery vehicles,and most       
 important preparing the food.They     
 have greatly reduced the number of    
 accidents over the years by the       
 wearing of chain-mail gloves and      
 apron-type garments. This protects the
 body from serious wounds as they strip
 meat from the bones.We had a feeling  
 that it was a happy firm. Everyone was
 friendly and helpful and smiling.     
 Herman Miller is a large modern       
 building covering some 7,500 sq ft.   
 This firm would not have been able to 
 site this factory on the nearby       
 industrial estate.
