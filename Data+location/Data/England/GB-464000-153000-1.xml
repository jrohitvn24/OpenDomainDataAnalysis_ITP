		<title>01GENERAL DESCRIPTION</title>
		<content> The area surveyed lies to the N.E. of 
 the town of Basingstoke. There is     
 varied land use including farming,    
 light industry, woodland and extensive
 residential areas. Both private and   
 local authority housing are integrated
 to provide residential areas for      
 commuters to Reading, London and local
 light industrial and administrative   
 work. There has been a considerable   
 programme of private and local        
 authority building to cater for the   
 London overspill. Land is still being 
 developed for extra housing and the   
 improvement and new building of a     
 network of roads. There is some       
 protected parkland and woodland to be 
 found, as well as several outlying    
 working farms. The area has undergone 
 rapid development in the past 20      
 years, the emphasis changing from     
 agricultural to administrative centres</content>
