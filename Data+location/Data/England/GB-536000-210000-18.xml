		<content>{SQUARE 3810                           
 A striking feature is the contrast    
 between land use on the Eastern and   
 Western halves of the square. To the  
 West the emphasis is residential but  
 to the East is mainly recreational.   
{WESTERN AREA:                         
 The{HOUSING}varies from small terraced
 houses built at the turn of the       
 century (the earliest dating back to  
 1893) to Council houses built in the  
 1950s and 60s.                        
 Public and other{SERVICES}provided    
 include the John Warner secondary     
 school, a local Post Office, two      
 public houses (the 'Old Highway       
 Tavern' and 'The Rye House') and small
 corner shops.
