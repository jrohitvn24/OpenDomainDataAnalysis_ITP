		<title>17My August walk to the stream</title>
		<content> On Saturday we went for a walk down   
 the stream. On the way we went past   
 Mrs.Inchley's house and down the road 
 through the woods. That was very wet  
 and muddy and there were lots of      
 leaves on the road. Mummy and Cherry  
 took us children. Jamie, Gemma, James,
 Tom and me kept on splashing in the   
 mud puddles. We walked through the    
 wood and on past a row of small       
 cottages. On the right there were     
 farmers' fields. We went along the    
 public footpath and through the fields
 down to the footbridge and I saw a    
 heron. Then we walked over the bridge 
 and along the other side of the stream
 until we found a place where we could 
 get down into the water. I went down  
 the bank and got stung all down the   
 back of my legs and then the others   
 came down but did not get stung.
