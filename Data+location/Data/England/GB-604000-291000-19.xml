		<content> There are three religions represented 
 in the village, Church of England,    
 Methodist and Baptist.  They each have
 their own church and services and all 
 are well attended by a loyal group.   
 The Methodists have a service every   
 Sunday afternoon plus monthly family  
 services and childrens' Sunday school 
 each week.  There is a harvest        
 thanksgiving and a Spring Flower      
 Festival as well as special Christmas 
 services.  The Womens' Fellowship run 
 fortnightly meetings.                 
 The Baptists have two services each   
 Sunday and run a Sunday school.  They 
 support Baptist missionaries and the  
 Tear Fund (The Evangelical Alliance   
 Relief) both of whom work in the Third
 World. Church members visit any one in
 need in the parish.  The Baptists     
 unite with the Anglican and Methodists
 for Radio Norfolk Bible Study Courses.</content>
