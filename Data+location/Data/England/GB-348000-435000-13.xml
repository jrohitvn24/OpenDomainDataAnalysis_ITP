		<title>13Games we play in Barton</title>
		<content>In the playground we play different    
games at different times of the year.  
Skipping and hopscotch are always      
popular as are various ball games.     
                                       
One ball game is called "Freeze". In   
this game children form a circle,      
standind with their feet apart. The    
ball is bounced in the centre of the   
circle and allowed to roll. The person 
between whose feet it rolls is "on".   
The others scatter. As soon as the one 
who is "on" picks up the ball he/she   
shouts "Freeze". THe others stand still
and he/she throws the ball attempting  
to hit one of the others. If he/she    
misses, all scatter. Anyone who is     
hit is also "on". The game continues   
until everyone is "on" or until the    
bell rings for the end of playtime.
