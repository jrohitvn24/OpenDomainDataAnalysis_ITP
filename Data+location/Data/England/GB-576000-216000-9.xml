		<content>    White Notley has a small Post      
 Office and village stores. The shop is
 very important to the village because 
 the nearest towns are several miles   
 away. It is also a meeting place for  
 people to chat. The shop has been sold
 twice in the past few years and the   
 new owners are carrying out lots of   
 renovation work. Some strange things  
 have been found in the lathe and      
 plaster walls.                        
    Just across the road is the village
 pub, the Cross Keys. Next to the pub  
 is a small brick building with a      
 curved brick roof. This is the old    
 village lockup which dates from 1828. 
    The first building in the village  
 on the way from Braintree is the      
 Village Hall. This is a modern        
 building, about ten years old and is  
 used for all sorts of meetings, dances
 and events by the village groups.     </content>
