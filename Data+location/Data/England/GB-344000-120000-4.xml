		<content>{Ash Rovers Football Club}was started  
 in 1972 by{Mr Fred Collins}.It started
 because there were a lot of people who
 wished to play football.There are     
 three different teams.                
    In each team there 12 players,     
 including the substitute.Altogether   
 there are 36 club members,as well as  
 six other people who help.            
    The strip is blue shirts and black 
 shorts,but the strip is not the same  
 for all the teams.The changed strip is
 white shirts and black shorts.All the 
 changed strips are the same.          
    Training is on Wednesday's.The     
 teams have a break from training      
 between seasons.

 season,which makes twelve altogether.
