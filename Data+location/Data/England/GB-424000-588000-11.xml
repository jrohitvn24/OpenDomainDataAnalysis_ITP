		<title>11ASHINGTON COLLIERY</title>
		<content>  Ashington mine was first developed in
 1846 and known as 'Fell em Doon',the  
 coal produced was used for landsale   
 coal which was sold localy.           
 In 1867 Bothal Pit opened and in 1873 
 Carl Pit then in 1867 Duke Pit.       
 Later in 1896 there were 4 other Pits 
 sunk just outside the Ashington area. 
 Surface drift entrances for miners    
 were driven at Bothal barns, Coney    
 Garth and Blakemoore although outside 
 the grid these locations were part of 
 the Colliery complex. Most of the land
 in the grid was owned by the coal     
 company to avoid paying compensation  
 for land subsidence. Today in 1985,   
 the colliery employs aproximately 600 
 men only, a drop from 4000 from       
 earlier years. A great deal of the    
 underground work is now mechanised,   
 but the coal is rapidly being worked  
 out limiting the collierys life.      </content>
