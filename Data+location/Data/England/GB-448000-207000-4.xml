		<title>04  Schools-Survey   Oxford</title>
		<content>  Most schools in Oxford were state,but
the Oxford High School and St. Edwards 
were private.On average most schools   
had about 14 teachers but one          
particularly large school had 42!Most  
schools in our area cater for the 9-14 
age group but two upper schools were   
14-18.Only one school took boarders;   
St.Edwards.                            
  Most schools do wear school uniform, 
but both Summertown and St.Edwards do  
not,Cherwell pupils wear uniform in the
first three years,but not in the sixth-
form.                                  
  Only St.Edwards had school on        
Saturday; this was only in the morning.
The amount of home-work varied from    
school to school.                      
  Oxford High was the oldest, and was  
opened in 1875.
