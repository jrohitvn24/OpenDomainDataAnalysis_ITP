		<content>Hem Heath pit is 1000 feet deep. Most  
of the coal produced is sold to the    
M.E.B. 1890 people work at Hem Heath,  
360 work on the surface and 1530 work  
underground. Underground jobs include  
face workers and developing workers.   
On the surface there are fitters,      
electricians, coal washers and general 
maintenance staff.                     
The men work shifts and they are paid  
according to how much coal they        
produce. Underground workers get       
more than surface workers because      
of the dangers.                        
Less men are taken on in the pit than  
there used to be. Machinery has cut    
down employment opportunities. Only 20 
men will be needed on a section that   
used to need 90.                       
There is no Youth Training Scheme at   
the pit, and the easiest way to get a  
job is knowing someone at the pit.     </content>
