		<title>18LITTLE BYTHAM GARDEN FETE</title>
		<content> The fete is usually held in the Old   
 Rectory garden on a Saturday afternoon
 in late June or early July.           
  "There were 11 stalls this year.     
 There was a raffle, a cake stall, a   
 book stall, the rifle range, the lucky
 dip, white elephant stall, and a lot  
 more. Each year the vicar comes out at
 3.00 to wish you well. We give money  
 to the vicar's funds. It finishes at  
 5.00 normally. Most of the things are 
 secondhand but some are new. The best 
 thing is the raffle because you win   
 everything."                          
 Another regular amusement is skittles.
 Heavy wooden "cheeses" are hurled at  
 nine battered old skittles set out in 
 a diamond pattern on a plank square.  
 Bales of straw protect bystanders!    
  In 1985 the fete raised Â£523 for St  
 Medard's church funds.
