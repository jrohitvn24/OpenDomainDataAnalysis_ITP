		<title>03RED ROCKS NURSING HOME</title>
		<content>  "This nursing home in Hoylake was    
 originally a private house. It can    
 accomodate 19 patients, some of whom  
 are very ill and need constant        
 attention. The Matron has been there  
 since the home opened 34 years ago.   
 All 45 nursing staff, working shifts, 
 are State Registed Nurses. At weekends
 and holidays schoolgirls give their   
 time to visit and help.               
                                       
   The patients have to pay high fees, 
 but have a private room with nice     
 views of Hilbre Island and the        
 estuary. The meals are very good!     
                                       
   Well kept gardens surround the house
 in which residents can relax and enjoy
 the healthy sea air. Matron even cares
 for patients pets."
