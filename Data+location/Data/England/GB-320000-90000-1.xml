		<title>01FARMLAND IN SOUTH EAST DEVON</title>
		<content> This is an area of mainly grassland   
 farming, containing flocks of sheep   
 and several dairy herds with about a  
 quarter of the land devoted to arable 
 crops, mostly cereals. It is in a     
 popular holiday area which is dotted  
 with permanent and touring caravan    
 sites. The north east corner is partly
 covered with indigenous trees together
 with a few sections of cultivated     
 forestry fir plantations. The south   
 west corner is the only residential   
 area - some of which is geared to the 
 influx of visitors during the holiday 
 period - mainly accommodation in guest
 houses. It is a peaceful, rural area -
 the higher points affording glorious  
 views of the surrounding countryside  
 with vistas extending to Lyme Bay. A  
 few people are engaged in agriculture 
 - but most work in nearby towns.
