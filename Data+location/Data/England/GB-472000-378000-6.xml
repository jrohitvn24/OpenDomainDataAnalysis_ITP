		<title>06PUBLIC TRANSPORT IN GROVE.</title>
		<content> The village of Grove is not served by 
 any form of public transport,apart    
 from the daily School Bus. A bus      
 service between Retford and Tuxford   
 stops on request about half a mile    
 away,at the road junction between the 
 Grove Village Road and the Retford /  
 Nether Headon Road.The road through   
 the village is used principally by    
 local cars,agricultural vehicles , and
 by visitors to the Church and the     
 Garden Centre.In the South-West of the
 region,the main East Coast Railway    
 lies on an embankment.Traffic is      
 almost entirely composed of High Speed
 '125' Expresses to and from           
 London.Each day,about 40              
 expresses travel North.This section of
 the track has coloured light          
 signalling and'continuous rail'.The   
 installation of the electrification   
 posts commenced this summer.          </content>
