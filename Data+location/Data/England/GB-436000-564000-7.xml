		<title>07LIVING ON A NEW ESTATE</title>
		<content> We live on the modern{Stadium  }      
{Estate.}Our names are Claire &amp; Michael
 our homes are only seven years old    
 and we like the gardens.The streets on
 the estate are named after golf       
 courses.The houses are compact,it is  
 good because in the winter it is easy 
 to heat.It has three bedrooms(one each
 for my brother and I and one for my   
 parents).There is also a bathroom,    
 kitchen and large{open plan sitting } 
{room,}with the stairs in the room.You 
 can see right through the house.      
     There is a field nearby called the
{Jack Clark Park,}a bowling club and   
 some shops.The{Greyhound Racing }     
 Stadium used to be on this site.From  
 our kitchen window we can see the sea.
 There is also the{Leas &amp; Marine Park }
 to play in.There is a pond with ducks 
 and a little steam train which goes   
 all the way round the park.           </content>
