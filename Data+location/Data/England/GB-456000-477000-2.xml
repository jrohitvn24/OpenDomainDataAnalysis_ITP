		<title>02Gilling-Wass Gap Farming</title>
		<content>  The main products are pasture, dairy 
 cattle, sheep and beef. Next come     
 barley and wheat then oil seed rape   
 and some peas and potatoes. The valley
 was once an oak swamp (the Hambleton  
 hills on the north side are limestone 
 and drain into the valley) but the    
 area has been artificially drained and
 improved to make it more fertile. On  
 the Ministry of Agriculture scale most
 of the land is grade 3 (on the south  
 side) with some grade 2 in the west.  
 The many steeper areas are wooded and 
 are grade five. Distribution is now   
 generally through merchants to big    
 firms and wholesale butchers. Some    
 pigs, sheep and dairy cattle are sold 
 locally in Malton, Thirsk and York.   
  Generally farming is mixed. There is 
 a sense of tradition in the farming,  
 although methods are as progressive as
 anywhere.                             </content>
