		<title>11Life in Saighton(2).</title>
		<content> Generally people live a very quiet    
 life but monthly in the village hall  
 there is a Women's Institute meeting &amp;
 also Bingo.The hall is also rented    
 eg.for children's parties,to pay for  
 its upkeep &amp; the village pays the     
 owner a small rent for its use.The    
 nearest doctors are at Chester &amp;      
 Tattenhall (4 &amp; 6 miles away) but an  
 ambulance calls to take patients to   
 various therapies in Chester.The      
 nearest police station &amp; shopping     
 centre are 3 miles away at Waverton   
 which is on the Chester bus route     
 but as there are only 7 daily buses,  
 without a car,travel can be a problem.
 3 roads from Saighton give access to  
 Chester, Waverton &amp; Wrexham.Once a    
 fortnight a mobile library comes from 
 Chester &amp; there are some comments that
 the books on the van are not changed  
 frequently enough.                    </content>
