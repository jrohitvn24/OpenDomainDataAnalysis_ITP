 parkland and 2 acres put to           
 horticultural use, supplying owner's  
 hotel.Surplus is sold on site.Owners  
 since 1983 are hoteliers in Skegness. 
 They are restoring the property and   
 park with sensitivity, and researching
 the history of Thorpe Hall.They feel  
 that the proposed Louth bypass would  
 give welcome relief from traffic noise
 and vibration.                        
 The{Dovecote}with foundations of stone
 from a previous house on the site is a
 listed building.The well documented

 who enamoured of Sir John Bolle gave  
 him jewellery and a portrait of       
 herself in a green dress.She followed 
 him from Cadiz in 1587 and finding him
 happily married,entered a nunnery,and 
 later died.Ballad engraved on study   
 windows.Believed to haunt the area.   </content>
