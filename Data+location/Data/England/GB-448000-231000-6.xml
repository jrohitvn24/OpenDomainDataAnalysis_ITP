		<title>06 SPECIAL OCCASIONS IN AYNHO</title>
		<content>   {MAYTIME IN THE SQUARE} is held     
every year in May. There are lots of   
stalls that sell things to raise money 
for village organisations. There is a  
procession followed by the Crowning of 
the MayQueen (a young girl), and the   
schoolchildren perform Morris, Sword   
and Maypole dances.                    
  The {CHURCH FETE} is held every year 
in June in the grounds of the Park     
House. There is a band, and lots of    
stalls that sell things as well as     
sideshows, competitions and raffles.   
The schoolchildren often dance. The    
money raised goes to the church.       
   {BONFIRE NIGHT} is held on a        
Saturday near 5th. November. A large   
fire is lit on the Playing Field and   
we have singing round the fire         
followed by a firework display. There  
is soup and beefburgers to eat. There  
is a competition for the best guy.     </content>
