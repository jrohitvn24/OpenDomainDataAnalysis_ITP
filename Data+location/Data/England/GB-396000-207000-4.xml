		<content> Duntisbourne Leer,which means a valley
 bottom amongst hills,is a small       
 picturesque village about 4 miles from
 Cirencester.For record purposes it is 
 joined to D.Abbots.Many of the        
 properties are detached cottages,     
 although there are farms around, and  
 some have dovecotes built into the    
 eaves.In recent years some building   
 has been permitted and it is hoped by 
 villagers that future development     
 except for renovation would be        
 refused.The ford and its family of    
 ducks are quite a tourist attraction  
 as are the cottages ,all with an      
 abundance of flowers,around this area.
 Life is very quiet and slow-moving    
 although the peace is periodically    
 disturbed by aircraft flying overhead.
 Leer is a village with fewer          
 facilities than in the past but which 
 still delights its residents.         </content>
