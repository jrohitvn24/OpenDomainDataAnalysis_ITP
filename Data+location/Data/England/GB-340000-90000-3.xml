		<content>           Golden Cap                  
      Seatown, dominated by Golden cap,
 is part of the parish of Chideock and 
 used to belong to the manor.  It is   
 one of the many places owned by the   
 National Trust, it is the highest     
 point on the south west coast.  Gales 
 have cost Seatown dear because such as
 November 23 1824 have wrecked several 
 houses including a farmhouse on the   
 seaward side of the Anchor Inn, and a 
 road leading in the direction of      
 Golden Cap, was often a tempory       
 hideout to smuggle goods.             
      A hundred and fifty years ago    
 there was a coast guard station on the
 top of Golden Cap it is a beauty spot 
 for visitors because from the top you 
 can see all the way from Portland     
 around to Torquay, the sides are steep
 but the top is reasonably flat.  It is
 191 metres high.                      </content>
