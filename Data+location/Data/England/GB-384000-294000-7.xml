		<content>                                       
    Just recently we have had a new    
housing  estate built in Seisdon. Day  
by day I watched the machinery start   
building it. Now it is all finished.   
    The estate is called Beechhurst    
Gardens because the big old house next 
to it is called Beechhurst Farm, but   
they cut down the beech tree in the    
farmyard which is the whole point      
about the name.                        
    Not many girls have moved in just  
boys.                                  
    I don't like the estate and I don't
think anyone else in the village does  
either.                                
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
