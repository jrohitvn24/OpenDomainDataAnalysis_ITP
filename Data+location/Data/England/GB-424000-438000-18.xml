		<content> The old Norman church was constructed 
 because there was a busy junction and 
 here would get the highest            
 attendance.No other buildings were    
 made until the 1800's.Some of these   
 houses had to be knocked down in the  
 1950's.It was at this time when a few 
 of the moderner houses were built.1978
 was the time when all of the council  
 estate commenced.
