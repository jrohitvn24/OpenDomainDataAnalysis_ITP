		<content> The pub was called the Five Bells     
 because there is five bells in the    
 tower and we think it was in the      
 village.The bell ringers used to have 
 a drink there before they rang the    
 bells.So Squire Huyshe had it moved so
 that they wouldn't drink before they  
 rang and people would go to church.   
 Henry Symons who used to own the pub  
 when it was in the village died in    
 1871 aged 52 years.It is now said to  
 be haunted at its present site by a   
 lady who was bricked up behind the    
 fire place.                           
 The womens institute or WI is a group 
 of women who do things and people come
 to talk on things like Banks, how to  
 make the most of your money:microwaves
 RNLI.Every year one of the members    
 goes to London they go to the Albert  
 Hall to tell each other what they have
 been doing in the year.               </content>
