		<title>14Monsal Dale Walk.</title>
		<content>    On the 24th of July 1985, I went,  
 along with about sixty other children,
 on our end of term event; a walk      
 through Monsal Dale in Derbyshire. At 
 nine o'clock in the morning we got on 
 the coach which was to take us the    
 twenty miles to Ashford-in-the-Water  
 where the walk started.               
    We walked for four or five miles   
 along the wooded valley of the river  
 Wye and then about midday we stopped  
 to eat our packed lunches. Afterwards 
 we walked on for another mile or two  
 and then stopped to have a paddle in  
 the cool waters of the river. Quite a 
 loy of the children fell over and got 
 extremely wet. After everybody had got
 dry we had a walk up a very steep hill
 at the top of which was a stall where 
 you could buy souveniers and then we  
 went home. I thought it was very      
 enjoyable but I don't fancy doing it  </content>
