  WOODCARVINGS IN THE PARISH CHURCH    
                                       
  The church has lots of carvings:there
are carvings of Saints,including       
St.Peter with his keys.Another has a   
staff and a water bottle.              
  There is a Font which was made in the
14th Century;it has a carved lid.      
  There is a carving of a Pelican;the  
Pelican is supposed to peck its own    
breast and feed its young with its own 
blood.                                 
  There is a carving with two heads and
four arms.                             
  Lots of little faces are hidden in   
the pews.                              
  I think the carvings are there to    
help people understand the Bible       
stories,and sometimes the carpenter was
having a little joke.
