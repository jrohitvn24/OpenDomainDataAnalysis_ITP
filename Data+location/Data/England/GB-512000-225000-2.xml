		<title>02GREAT OFFLEY.</title>
		<content> Offley is a village of moderate size  
 situated half-way between Hitchin and 
 Luton, at the edge of the A505 on top 
 of a hill, with a panoramic view of   
 the countryside. This quiet country   
 village affords much to its residents 
 and frequent visitors. Its countryside
 is criss-crossed by bridlepaths and   
 footpaths, along which there is a wide
 variety of flora and fauna. The chalk 
 hill has many wild flowers particular 
 to that soil.                         
 There are many clubs and societies in 
 Offley, of which a number are affili- 
 ated to the Recreation Centre; e.g.   
 football, cricket and tennis clubs;   
 the fishing club also meets there. The
 Centre has over 600 members. There is 
 also a very active Riding Club and    
 many horses are at livery in Offley.
