		<content> We have our evening meal about 5      
 o'clock,followed by the nightly       
 argument of who did the washing up    
 last, I usually disappear into the    
 ilving room with a cup of coffee,     
 Leaving my husband to sort out the    
 situation. Unless the children have   
 involved me in a meeting for cubs or  
 guides, The rest of the evening in my 
 own, Sometimes I sew or read or just  
 watch televisions, perhaps do a spot  
 of gardening if the weather is fine. I
 also belong to two ladies groups and  
 I'm a non-singing member of our local 
 operatic society, Three organisations 
 usually take up a couple of nights a  
 week. At about 11o'clock I make up the
 packed lunches for the next day and   
 perhaps have a bite to eat for supper.
 I do tend to watch television until   
 quite late, before going to bed.
