		<title>02ALL SAINTS'CHURCH SUTTON</title>
		<content> The church dates back to the late 12th
 century.The chancel was built in C14  
 and the tower in C15.The village was  
 owned by the Burgoyne family until    
 1938 so there are memorials to members
 of that family in the church.There are
 several interesting features in the   
 church including a Jacobean pulpit,a  
 medieval chest,a double piscina,      
 sedilia and a Sacred barrel organ.The 
 barrel organ is housed in the belfry  
 and is the only working organ of its  
 kind in Bedfordshire.The present      
 Rector is also Vicar of Potton and    
 Cockaine Hatley.Services are held in  
 All Saints'Church on most Sundays.The 
 9am service is a Holy Communion       
 Service and the 6pm service is        
 Evensong.On the first Sunday in the   
 month,there is a Family Service at    
 10.15am.                              
                                       </content>
