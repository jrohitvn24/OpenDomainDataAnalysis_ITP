		<title>20NATURE RESERVE   GREENFORD</title>
		<content>    The Litten Nature Reserve contains 
 oak, ash, grassland and woodland.     
 Without some work and attention to    
 keep the diversity the area would grow
 back to its original oakland. There   
 are hedgehogs, wood mice and shrews;  
 wrens, bullfinches, fly catchers and  
 many common garden and woodland birds.
 There are no rabbits because the area 
 is too small. Play groups, middle and 
 high schools come to  see the reserve 
 and sometimes to help tidy up. There  
 is a weekly nature club for children. 
     One lady complained about what she
 thought were rats but they were       
 squirrels knocking over the dustbins  
 for scraps of food. She bought some   
 poison and the squirrels ate it and   
 died. Some men were going to build    
 flats and the local people had to     
 fight to keep Litten, and of course   
 they won.              Sophia Aziz    </content>
