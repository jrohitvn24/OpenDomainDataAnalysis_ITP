		<title>10LEOMINSTER CATTLE MARKET</title>
		<content> The market is owned by auctioneers    
 Russell Baldwin and Bright. The market
 was originally where the International
 store is now, but it was moved to     
 Easters meadows on the A.49, where {  
{Leominster}by-pass will be constructed
 in July 1986.                         
 The market was re-sited because there 
 is more room for large lorries to     
 park, more space to extend the market 
 and easy access for farmers. Calves   
 and weanlings are sold on Fridays,    
 beef cattle monthly and sheep sales   
 are held in August.                   
 Of the total cattle sold on Saturday  
 15th June 1985, 76.5% were Hereford   
 cross Friesian, 3.25% were pure       
 Herefords, 9.75% were French          
 Charollais cross and 10.5% were French
 Limousin cattle.                      
                                       
                                       </content>
