		<content> For a time it seemed likely that the  
 Church would be sold for use as a     
 warehouse or even demolished.         
 Eventually, because of its historical 
 and architectural merits it was       
 designated an ancient monument and    
 retained by the Redundant Churches    
 Commission, being declared redundant  
 in 1975. In 1981 the roof was restored
 and the fabric is in fine order. The  
 Church has not been deconsecrated - 4 
 services a year may be held and there 
 is always a good congregation for the 
 Easter and Harvest festivals. Baptisms
 can be arranged in conjunction with   
 one of the services. Funerals must be 
 held elsewhere, although the          
 Churchyard, tended by the Parish, is  
 used for burials. The pews and organ  
 have been sent to other churches, but 
 the fine peal of 8 bells can still be 
 heard across the countryside.         </content>
