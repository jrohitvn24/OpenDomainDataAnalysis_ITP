		<title>10A Talk with an Old Person</title>
		<content> One of the ladies that we interviewed 
 had lived in Desborough for{80 years  
 she gave us this information about    
 Desborough.                           
 The school she went to was Desborough 
 county school for girls, which is now 
 called{Havelock Junior School}and it  
 is now a mixed school.                
 There was no A6 in Desborough. There  
 was a Blacksmith's shop in those days 
 and the children all used to watch the
 smith work. The largest residential   
 road in Desborough is{Dunkirk avenue,}
 which did not exist then. Then it was 
 covered by many allotments. The houses
 did not have any bathrooms then but   
 many have been rebuilt .              
 The present day Gold Sreet was then a 
 yard and the poor houses were         
 there.All the children who lived there
 caught a disease from washing in the  
 water from the taps outside.          </content>
