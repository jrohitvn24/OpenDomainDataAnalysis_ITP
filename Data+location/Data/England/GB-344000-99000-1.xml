		<content> The whole extent of this block,       
 composed of agricultural land lying   
 at heights between l25-700 feet above 
 sea level, may be seen from any of the
 knolls and crests into which it       
 swells.  Its character of small hedged
 pastures and hardwood copses of a few 
 acres, and little arable, is dictated 
 by the steepness of its slopes.  The  
 character of its communities too might
 be guessed at from the physical       
 isolation from one another of its two 
 small villages, Netherbury and Stoke  
 Abbott seen lying a mile apart as the 
 crow flies, but separated by 3 miles  
 of road.  The small town of           
 Beaminister, bisected by the block    
 perimiter, contains the P.O., shops   
 and schools which the villages no     
 longer possess; Beaminister is, too,  
 the H.Q. of the Team Ministry which   
 serves the scattered village churches.</content>
