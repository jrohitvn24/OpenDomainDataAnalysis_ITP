     The Victory Club was built in     
{1923,}3 years before the{Memorial     
{Hall}was built. A joiner took{5 years 
 to build it. It was originally built  
 for the same reason as the Memorial   
 Hall, to commemorate the victory of   
 the First World War, hence the name   
{'The Victory Club'.                   
     It is now used just as a club for 
 drinks and discos.                    
                                       
{THE MEMORIAL PIT COTTAGES             
{   }The Memorial Pit Cottages were    
 built in memory of the{Hester Pit     
{disaster.}They were built in{1910.    
     People are still living in these  
 cottages and they keep them in good   
 condition.
