		<title>12COMMUTING FROM PADBURY</title>
		<content> The population of Padbury is a little 
 over 600, that of Hillesden only about
 300. Some people are self-employed    
 within the villages on farms, in shops
 and public houses,but with very few   
 exceptions the majority of the        
 workforce have to travel,sometimes    
 considerable distances,to work. Some  
 travel to the brickworks (soon to be  
 closed) 5 miles away. Some travel to  
 the nearest town, Buckingham, which is
 3 miles away. The majority, however,  
 travel 15 miles either to Aylesbury or
 the new city of Milton Keynes. There  
 are several people who commute to     
 London daily, either on the train from
 Milton Keynes or driving the 50 miles 
 each way. There are others who have   
 homes in London and commute weekly to 
 second homes in Padbury or Hillesden. 
 The result to the village is numerous 
 cars and a quiet middle of the day.   </content>
