		<title>11 BRERETON GIRL'S LEISURE</title>
		<content>                                       
In my leisure time I practise my       
recorder. I sometimes play on my       
sister's organ. I have a descant       
recorder and a tenor recorder.         
There are the same notes on both       
recorders and they are in the same     
places. I have a music stand to stand  
my music on. When I'm not playing the  
recorder or organ I listen to my       
radio or tape recorder. Most ofthe     
cassettes I listen to are the top 40.  
They have my favourite songs or songs  
I hate. I have one tape called         
"Christmas Carols from Westminster"    
and one with recorder playing and me   
singing on it. Sometimes I call for my 
friend or friends, then we tidy my     
shed and we play in there. On hot days 
I sometimes sun-bathe or have a water  
fight with my sister.
