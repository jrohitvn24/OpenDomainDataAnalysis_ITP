 This block was worked on by the 1st   
 year of West Wight Middle School,     
 situated at the Western end of the    
 Isle of Wight.  This block and the    
 block immediately to the North form   
 the area known as the West Wight.     
 Being isolated from the rest of the   
 Island gives us a unique atmosphere   
 and close community spirit.           
 The area is picturesque and relies    
 heavily on the tourist industry.      
 There are few local jobs apart from   
 tourism and many people travel the 12 
 miles to Newport the Islands capital, 
 to work.  Much of the area is National
 Trust Land including downland         
 designated as of Special Scientific   
 interest.  There is a Nature Reserve  
 covering an area of Marshland.        
 Freshwater is the largest village,    
 home of the poet Alfred Lord Tennyson.</content>
