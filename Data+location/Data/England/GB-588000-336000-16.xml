 a variety of flowers (Roses and Spring
 flowers being very popular). They also
 grew a range of vegetables: potatoes, 
 carrots, brassica, peas, salad crops  
 and soft fruit for personal use. One  
 lady grows vegetables for sale at the 
 local market for Women's Institute    
 funds. Other{outdoor recreations      
 include fishing, cycling, football,   
 tennis and swimming.{Indoor hobbies   
 included watching T.V., reading, doing
 crosswords, organ and piano playing,  
 knitting, sewing, handicrafts in      
 general and interior decotrating, as  
 an unavoidable evil. Several men enjoy
 an evening out at Walsingham or Creake
