		<title>19A 3rd CROSSING OULTON BROAD?</title>
		<content>Everybody in Lowestoft and the         
surrounding District has  been         
discussing the idea  for a new         
crossing over Lake Lothing and  the    
Broad. Lowestoft is built on an island 
so the demand for a new bridge is      
great. REASONS FOR:                    
            Mutford Lock Bridge is too 
            narrow, the A12 runs       
            through Lowestoft and      
            traffic frequently gets    
            held up by lack of routes  
            over Lake Lothing.         
REASONS AGAINST:                       
            Lack of room in the        
            surrounding area;          
            Conservationists worry that
            Broadland areas would be   
            lost; The cost of building.
I think that although we need a third  
crossing there is nowhere to put it!
