		<title>01Gt Haseley &amp; Milton Common</title>
		<content> Gt Haseley is a small village with    
several farms, a church , a public     
house, and a primary school. The houses
are mainly constructed of local stone, 
the more modern houses , particularly  
local authority ones are of brick. Many
of the latter have recently been       
purchased by the occupants. It is      
significant that the village has no    
shops although there were several until
ten years ago.                         
 Milton Common, the other part of the  
area with a number of habitations grew 
up alongside the A40 Oxford to London  
road. This road has become less        
important with the construction of the 
M40 Motorway, but Milton Common has    
become a service area for same. A      
hotel,a public house and several       
garages are found there.
