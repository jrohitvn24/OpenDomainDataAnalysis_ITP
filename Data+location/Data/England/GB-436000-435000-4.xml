		<title>04**   DEPUTY LORD MAYOR    **</title>
		<content>{Interview with the Deputy Lord Mayor  
{of Leeds,and the Deputy Lady Mayoress}
 As part of our Domesday Survey, we    
 were waiting outside Mr. Hyde's shop  
 when he returned from Seacroft        
 Hospital where he had been delivering 
 newspapers and sweets. To do this     
 Councillor Hyde got up at 7 a.m. that 
 morning. Mr. Hyde left for home and   
 returned shortly as Councillor Hyde.  
 When Councillor Hyde arrived in his   
 Dorchester Limousine (GUA 333Y) he    
 stepped out before his wife and began 
 to answer our questions.This was my   
 question:-                            
 "Do you have as many responsibilities 
 as the Lord Mayor?"                   
 Councillor Hyde said that he didn't   
 but he still had to go to the         
 appointments because the Lord Mayor   
 might need to be in two places at     
 once.{Continued on page 5.            </content>
