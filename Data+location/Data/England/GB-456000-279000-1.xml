		<title>01SWINFORD LANDSCAPE</title>
		<content>{Swinford}is a rural area in south     
 Leicestershire. The average height    
 above sea level is 400 feet, the      
 highest point being 501 feet. The land
 is gently undulating with no prominent
 topographical features. The River Avon
 and part of{Stanford Reservoir}occupy 
 the S.E. corner.                      
  The centre of{population}is the      
 compact village of Swinford with only{
{Stanford Hall}and five other buildings
 used for habitation. Swinford had     
 dwellings and farm buildings built in 
 various eras juxtaposed with three    
 small modern{housing}developments and 
 three groups of council properties.   
 The newest properties are almost      
 exclusively owned by non indigenous   
 inhabitants. Proximity to the M1 and  
 M6 motorways partly accounts for the  
 present dormitory village situation.
