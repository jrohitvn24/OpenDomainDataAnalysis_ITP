		<content>    Fambridge Hall is situated on the  
 northern outskirts of White Notley.   
 Sir Andrew Stark, who owns the house, 
 said that it is placed in a 'sugar    
 bowl' which protects it from the north
 winds, provides good views to the     
 south and yet is high enough above the
 river not to be flooded. This would   
 have been why the site was chosen.    
    We know that there has been a house
 on the site for a very long time.  Sir
 Andrew showed us some of the things   
 that have been found in the garden of 
 the house such as a 4000 year old     
 flint arrow head, a Roman coin and an 
 18th century coin.                    
    In the records of the 11th and 12th
 centuries there are a number of French
 sounding names linked with 'Fam(or    
 Fan)Bregge'. Thomas de Walton is one  
 of them and Fan means Fen and Bregge  
 means Bridge.                         </content>
