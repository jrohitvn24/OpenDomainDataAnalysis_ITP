		<title>16Station Road</title>
		<content>{Station Road}was once a quiet road    
 leading to the Maltings. Now it is a  
 busy road, with much traffic. It is   
 particularly busy in the mornings and 
 evenings. There is a main line station
 to London and the north. Many         
 commuters travel to work each day.    
 There is a railway crossing, which    
 releases a stream of traffic each day 
 up the hill.                          
 Efforts have been made to have a      
 controlled crossing but with no       
 result. The school children have to   
 cross Station Road but they have a    
 crossing guide to help them. After the
 morning rush the traffic thins out to 
 a stream of mainly,east coast traffic,
 chiefly continental lorries with      
 exports and imports. At the crossroads
 the road narrows and there's a hill   
 making it difficult to see on-coming  
 traffic.                              </content>
