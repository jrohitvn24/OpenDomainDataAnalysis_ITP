 Mummy comes into my room and says "Its
 time to get up",but I go back to sleep
 again. Every Monday we go to collect  
 Mrs. Seviour,our cleaning lady. I eat 
 mashed up Weetabix and Cornflakes for 
 breakfast. We jump in the car and go  
 to School.When the bell rings we go   
 into the classroom and read, then we  
 have the Register.After Assembly our  
 teacher, Mrs. Reid, talks to us. Then 
 we do maths, reading routes, and
