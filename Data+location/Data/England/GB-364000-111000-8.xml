		<content> There are few recreational facilities 
 available in the block and inhabitants
 of the area must travel to larger     
 towns for recreation.  The nearest    
 picture houses and theatres are at    
 Yeovil which is 7 miles away.         
 Sherborne the nearest town has        
 thriving amateur dramatic socities,   
 concerts of classical music which are 
 often held in the Abbey and a newly   
 acquired Theatre owned by the Boys    
 Public School and which hosts         
 travelling theatre companies.         
 Facilities for young people are       
 extremely limited with some villages  
 big enough running youth clubs and    
 discos.  Sporting facilities are owned
 by the Boys Public School at Sherborne
 and include a very good swimming pool,
 gymnasium and squash courts, all of   
 which are open to the public at set   
 times.                                </content>
