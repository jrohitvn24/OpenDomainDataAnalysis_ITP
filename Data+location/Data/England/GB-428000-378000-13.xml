		<title>13WOODTHORPE HALL</title>
		<content> Woodthorpe Hall is built of sandstone 
  and has mullion windows.This 350     
 year old "gentleman's residence" lies 
 south of Totley village and is        
 surrounded by farmlands and ancient   
 woods.It is reached by a narrow lane  
 passing Fanshawe Gate Hall which is   
 another privately owned ancient       
 mansion.                              
 Currently Woodthorpe Hall is owned and
 occupied by the{Shepley family }who   
 came in 1926.Its previous owners      
 converted the Hall from its farmhouse 
 use when the ground floor rooms were  
 used as a kitchen,living room,stable, 
 and cowshed and upstairs was storage  
 for hay and grain. Delightful gardens 
 with lawns,flower borders, and trees  
 surround the house. Set in one wall is
 an unusual gate.Its posts have carved 
 in them a happy and a sad face.This is
 the work of the present owner.        </content>
