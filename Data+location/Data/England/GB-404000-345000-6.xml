		<content>  There are two factories in our area, 
only one: B.I.S.,still operates and the
other: Ribdon Clay Works, is a refuse  
tip now. B.I.S.started in 196O and was 
producing sand by 1961.The reason it   
was built in Oakamoor was because of   
the presence of the right rock and it  
was near The Potteries. The sand is    
blasted out of the ground and is used  
in car windows,bullet proof glass,non  
drip paint,scouring powder,cosmetics,  
special flour and pottery. B.I.S.covers
5OO acres and employs 2OO people.Aidon 
Taylor was the founder of B.I.S. and a 
director.The sand at Oakamoor should   
last another 75 years.There are 4O     
conveyor belts and the longest is 39O  
meters,which is used to carry sand to  
the railway.They use 5OO kilos of      
gelignite mixed with diesel and        
fertiliser every blast.The explosions  
take place at 3.3Opm any working day.  </content>
