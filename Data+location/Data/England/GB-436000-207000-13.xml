		<content> The Farm Museum at Cogges, Witney gets
visitors mostly from close to home and 
also from Ireland, France, Germany,    
Holland, Spain, Scandinavian countries 
Italy, Japan, U.S.A. and Canada. They  
get approximately 45,000 visitors a    
year although there were 70,000 in 1981
 The Bishop's Palace was found         
recently at the Mount Mill site. They  
hope to be able make it into a tourist 
attraction because it is so old. It    
dates from Saxon times and Queen       
Emma. They are trying to uncover and   
restore  the foundations but a great   
deal of funding must be found before   
any work can be started. Some old      
people's flats were to be built on the 
site when the   remains were uncovered 
and they proved to be much more        
important than anyone had expected. If 
this is restored there will be even    
more tourists who will want to visit.  </content>
