		<title>05ARKELLS KINGSDOWN BREWERY</title>
		<content> The brewery company of{J.Arkell &amp; Sons
{Ltd.}was established in 1843 in Lower 
 Stratton. In 1861 a new brewery was   
 built at{Kingsdown.}Succeeding        
 generations of Arkells have continued 
 to run the brewery and in 1985 it     
 remains in independent family         
 ownership. Brewing is carried out in  
 the traditional method. The original  
 steam powered equipment is still used.
 The brewery and its tall chimney are a
 familiar sight and the smell of hops  
 is often borne on the wind across our 
 area. 74 people are employed at the   
 brewery. Arkells own 66 tied houses, 6
 of them in our area and as far afield 
 as Hilmarton, Cirencester, Lambourn   
 and Wroughton. Three draught beers are
 brewed, BB, BBB and Kingsdown Ale,    
 plus a keg beer and a lager. A fleet  
 of 6 lorries delivers the beer. The   
 free trade extends as far as London.  </content>
