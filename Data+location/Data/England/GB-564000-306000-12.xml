		<content>{A day in the Junior Class at Shouldham
  School starts at 9a.m. when one child
 rings the bell. This bell is as old as
 the school and is dated 1866. It is   
 hung in the south gable. We line up in
 our classes and then go in.           
  The register is called first and then
 the dinner register. We bring dinner  
 money on a Monday and it is Â£3.10 per 
 week.We also bring 10p for school fund
 and this money pays for our outings   
 and Christmas party.                  
  Next follows prayers where we are    
 given a short talk or told a story,   
 sing a hymn and say a prayer. We all  
 join together on Wednesdays and       
 Fridays and the vicar comes in to take
 prayers about once a month.           
  Each day we begin with class maths   
 where we all work together. Mr.Swift  
 uses the blackboard and we have a     
 different topic each week.            </content>
