		<title>18SAINSBURY'S DEPOT</title>
		<content>  Sainsbury's own a chain of           
 supermarkets which are spread all over
 the country. In Hoddesdon there is a  
 Sainsbury's depot and a Sainsbury's   
 supermarket.                          
  Sainsbury's depot is situated in     
 Pindar Road and covers 200,000 square 
 feet. It deals mainly with fresh      
 foodstuffs.                           
  It is very important to keep the food
 fresh. It is only on the shelves in   
 the shops for about twenty four hours 
 at the most.                          
  The depot has a fleet of 150 lorries.
 The food is usually delivered by 7.00 
 a.m. to 300 shops within a radius of  
 70 miles.                             
  The food is stored in a large cold   
 store. The company only employs men at
 the depot because of the nature of the
 work undertaken.                      
                                       </content>
