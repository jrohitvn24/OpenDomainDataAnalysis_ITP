		<title>01My Village - East Hoathly</title>
		<content> The village is small, it has one      
 grocer's. Also a butcher's, garage,   
 post office and two pubs. The school  
 is next to the Church. The recreation 
 ground has a play area, tennis courts,
 cricket and football pitches. There is
 a dangerous bend on the busy A22 which
 runs through the centre of the        
 village. The churches of Chiddingly   
 and East Hoathly have the same Rector,
 Rev.P.Amos.                           
 In East Hoathly there are a number    
 of light industries also farming and  
 forestry. There is a Stud Farm on the 
 Waldron Road which owns a lot of the  
 farm land.
