		<title>07Grantham:Water works</title>
		<content> The Anglian Water Authority controls  
 the small reservoir and water works   
 at Saltersford on the River Witham.   
 These water works were established in 
 the 19th Century to provide Grantham  
 with water when the town wells and the
 medieval Conduit became inadequate.By 
 coincidence the site was found to     
 contain an extensive Romano-British   
 river ford settlement. This was the   
 crossing of the River Witham          
 originally known as the Salters Ford  
 after the road used in pre-Medieval   
 times for the transport of salt.      
 Excavations around 1900 by Henry      
 Preston,the manager of the waterworks,
 revealed many find relating to        
 everyday Romano-British life which are
 now in the Grantham Museum.
