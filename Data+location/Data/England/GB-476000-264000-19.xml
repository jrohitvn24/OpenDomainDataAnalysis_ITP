At 0915 school Assembly is taken by a  
member of staff. Sometimes instead of  
assembly we have hymn practice taken   
by Mrs Gordon (conductor) and Mr       
Berisford (pianist). After assembly we 
have Maths or English sets. We also    
do Art and various topics. P.E. is     
another activity. During the day we    
have two 10 minute playtimes and a 1hr 
playtime for dinner. Every year at     
Christmas and during the summer        
bazaars are held. School jumble        
sales are held in school. At Christmas 
concerts are prepared and then         
tickets are sold to the parents,       
Grandparents etc. Open evenings are    
held at the end of a school year.      
Parents come into school to help in    
many areas. They also raise money to   
buy equipment for school.
