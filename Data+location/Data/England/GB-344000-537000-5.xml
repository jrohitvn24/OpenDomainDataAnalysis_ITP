		<content> With a good inspection system at      
 schools for children, child health is 
 reasonably good in all respects,      
 although it remains to be seen as to  
 long-term health, in view of our      
 contemporary consumption of large     
 quantities of junk and convenience    
 foodstuffs.                           
                                       
 Infant and adult health remains       
 reasonable, although this may arise   
 more from generally better health     
 experienced amongst rural people,     
 since access to hospitals (Penrith and
 Carlisle) and doctors' surgeries is   
 not easy. Our survey showed the       
 following distances from home to      
 doctor for varying percentages of     
 residents: 6%-5miles; 23%-6miles; 12%-
 7miles; 29%-8miles; 12%-9miles;       
 6%-10miles; 6%-12miles.
