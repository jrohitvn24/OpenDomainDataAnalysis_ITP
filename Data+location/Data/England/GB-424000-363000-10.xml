		<content>   In these squares the land is used   
 for many different things.Most of the 
 land is kept grassland or moorland.   
   Much of the remaining land is taken 
 up by farms,and grazing land for      
 animals,but there is a small amount of
 crop farming in the area.For          
 instance,crops like potatoes and corn 
 are grown.                            
    In some of the squares there are   
 rivers,like the River Wye,and the     
 River Derwent.Also on the land there  
 are woods and forests,they are        
 deciduous but there are some conifers.
    Man has made maximum use of the    
 land,there are six disused quarries   
 and one used quarry.The only remaining
 quarry produces sandstone,used for    
 much of the areas buildings.
