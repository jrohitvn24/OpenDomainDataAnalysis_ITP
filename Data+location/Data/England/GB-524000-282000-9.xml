		<title>09CHURCH FARM (PART1)</title>
		<content> Caroline's Dad works Church Farm. He  
 told us about the Austrian            
 prisoners working on his farm during  
 world war 2. They made one of the     
 sheds which can still be seen in his  
 farm yard . He also told us about his 
 auntie who fell in love with an       
 Italian prisoner called Ernesto       
 Cerafer and they married soon         
 after.Mr.Racey also said he uses old  
 bomb shelters as grain stores.When we 
 asked him if anything funny happened  
 to him he told us he found some bombs 
 while he was ploughing a field and he 
 called the police to keep everyone    
 away from the airfield.A few minutes  
 later a man came from the army to     
 defuse them,but put them in the boot  
 of his car and told Mr.Racey they were
 harmless.
