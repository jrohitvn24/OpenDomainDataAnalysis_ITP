		<title>17OUR SCHOOL LOLLIPOP MAN.</title>
		<content> Our lollipop man was born in 1914 and 
 has lived in Inkberrow all of his     
 life.He has been lollipop man at      
 Inkberrow school for fourteen years.He
 attended Inkberrow school as a boy    
 when he was five and left at fourteen.
 He was only absent twice in all that  
 time.For good attendance he was given 
 five shillings,which was a lot of     
 money in those days.The teachers were 
 very strict and the headmaster had a  
 thin cane and a thick cane which he   
 frequently used.When they played      
 football against Cookhill school,three
 miles away,the boys would run all the 
 way after the headmaster on his       
 bicycle,play the game and run all the 
 way back again.                       
 We shall all miss our lollipop man    
 when he retires this year.
