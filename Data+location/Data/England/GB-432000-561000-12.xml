		<title>12LEEK SHOWS</title>
		<content> For many men gardening is a favourite 
 hobby.Some grow only flowers,while    
 others concentrate on vegetables or   
 both,but to many,the most important   
 part of their garden is the leek      
 trench,for the  North East is well    
 known for its leek shows.             
   The seed saved from the previous    
 year ,is sown in January in heated    
 greenhouses where the seedlings remain
 protected until June when the danger  
 of frost is over.They are then planted
 into the specially prepared leek      
 trench where they are cared for and   
 fed,often with secret ingredients,    
 until September when take place the   
 leek shows organized by local public  
 houses and social clubs.The prizes are
 awarded according to size,{15cm of    
{white,}quality and volume.Not only are
 leeks shown,but also flowers,fruit and
 vegetables.                           </content>
