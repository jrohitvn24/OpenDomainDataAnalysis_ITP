		<content>      Hewlett-Packard are an American  
 owned high technology company,        
 specialising in building computer     
 components.  They acquired their      
 present site from the Duke of Beaufort
 about 3 years ago, and much of the 186
 acres is already developed.           
      The main factory covers 125,000  
 square feet and is on an open plan    
 construction.  Micro-chips are made on
 this site (some have a value of over  
 Â£1,000) as are floppy discs, disc     
 drives and micro drives.  At present  
 320 people are employed.  All of the  
 machines that make the components are 
 computer controlled, so most of the   
 staff are administrative.             
      This factory in Bristol (sited   
 close to the M4) is one of 4 in the   
 U.K.  Many of the products are        
 exported to over 60 countries.
