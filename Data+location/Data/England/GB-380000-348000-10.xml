On Loomer Road there is an industrial  
estate with factories such as the      
oatcake factory, a plant-hire firm     
which hires out tractors and trailers, 
two printing firms, cement works, a    
public service agency and G.T.Products 
which sells equipment to retail        
businesses.   Loomer Road leads into   
rough agricultural land which in the   
near future is going to be used for    
opencast mining.   This place is called
Apedale.   Apedale also is a wood      
consisting of both deciduous and       
coniferous trees.   In Apedale there   
are five concrete shelters which may   
have been entrances to old mineshafts. 
To make them safer a fence should be   
placed round them.   The northern area 
of Apedale is industrial and there is  
still a mine being worked.
