 served by two junctions.There are good
 long distance coach connections .     
{RAIL.}The bus and railway stations are
 connected.Luton has good main line    
 links with the Midlands and London St.
 Pancras.There are 22 trains each day  
 on the newly electrified line to

{AIR.}Luton International Airport is   
 owned and run by the Borough Council.

 holiday flights to Europe and N.Africa
