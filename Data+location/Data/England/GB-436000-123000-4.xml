		<content> The Anglican Church of All Saints,    
 situated in the centre of the village,
 was erected in 1854 by public         
 subscription,and consecrated in 1855. 
 The roof was restored in 1945, and a  
 modern organ was installed in 1955 to 
 commemorate the centenary. It is part 
 of the united benefice of Michelmersh,
 Timsbury, Farley Chamberlayne and     
 Braishfield, the present incumbent    
 being Rev.D.Bruce Kington, who resides
 at the rectory at Braishfield. Four   
 hangings in modern embroidery hang in 
 the Church. The altar kneelers record 
 the names of past rectors.There are 53
 members on the electoral roll.        
 The United Reformed Church was built  
 in 1818, and is administered from the 
 parent Church in Romsey, who are      
 waiting the appointment of a new      
 minister.There are 10 adult church    
 members,and 10 junior church members. </content>
