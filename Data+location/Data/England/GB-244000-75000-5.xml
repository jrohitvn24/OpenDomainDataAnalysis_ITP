		<content> There are three new houses in         
 Lamerton.One of the houses is called  
 the Barn.The Barn is a barn converted 
 into a house.It has red tiles on the  
 roof.Ruth Horsley from our school     
 lives there.White Gables is a detached
 house.It is very new and modern.The   
 roof is gabled and has asbestos slate 
 on the roof.It has 2 storeys and has a
 small front garden.                   
 The older terraced cottages are mostly
 much smaller than the newer houses,   
 and many of the older people still    
 live in them.Some new houses for old  
 people are to be built at the end of  
 the Council estate,and there are also 
 some new houses being built near the  
 bridge.
