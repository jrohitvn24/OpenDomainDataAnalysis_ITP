		<title>18KEMPSFORD THURSDAY CLUB</title>
		<content>  A group of over 50s meet on alternate
 Thursday afternoons at the {Village   
{Hall}for tea and a chat. There is no  
 fee but a draw and a "bring and buy"  
 sale are held at each session. The    
 club started in 1972 to combat        
 potential loneliness. Average         
 attendance is 20 - 23 with a majority 
 of ladies.                            
  There are strong connections with the
 school, particularly at Harvest and at
 Christmas. Activities include two     
 mystery coach tours, parties, and     
 gifts of an  Egg at Easter and flowers
 on Mothering Sunday.
