		<title>05THE AMBERLEY CHURCH &amp; CASTLE</title>
		<content> THE PARISH CHURCH OF ST. MICHAEL,     
            AMBERLEY.                  
 The building is 800 years old. Its    
 chancel is as long as its nave. It was
 once used by Bishops of Chichester,   
 who lived in the adjoining Castle,    
 particularly to ordain priests. There 
 is a south aisle, a tower of 5 bells  
 rung anticlockwise and a porch. Points
 of interest are a Norman chancel arch 
 and medieval wall paintings. There is 
 a priest-in-charge who also looks     
 after four other churches. 60-70      
 people worship on Sundays at two      
 services at 8.00 and 10.30 am. The two
 churchwardens and a P.C.C. work with  
 the vicar in running the church.      
 The Castle, now privately owned, is a 
 fortified manor house built in the    
 14th century with walls added in later
 centuries. It now has a portcullis    
 operated by an electric switch !      </content>
