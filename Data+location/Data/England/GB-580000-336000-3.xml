 The total population of Stanhoe is 220
 to which must be added 14 people at   
 Shammar.  Of Stanhoe's occupants 54   
 are of pensionable age, a high        
 proportion.  The majority of these    
 have lived in the village for most of 
 their working lives but there are also
 a few who came here on leaving work in
 urban areas.  The young make up a much
 smaller proportion of the total, 24   
 being under 16 years.  Except for the 
 new houses which have so far brought 4
 retired couples into the community the
 population remains fairly steady,     
 there being relatively little movement
 of married couples and their families 
 as there is in areas where a better   
 job usually means a move.  Once       
 established most prefer to stay where 
 they are and several have settled here</content>
