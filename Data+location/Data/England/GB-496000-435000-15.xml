		<title>15WALKINGTON CONCERNS,PART 2.</title>
		<content>  PUBLIC MEETINGS WERE ALSO HELD OVER  
 THE RE_SITING OF THE TELEPHONE BOX TO 
 ALLOW ACCESS TO RED GATES DEVELOPMENT.
 MAINLY USED BY LORRY DRIVERS SOME SAID
 IT SHOULD BE OUTSIDE THE VILLAGE TO   
 REDUCE THE HAZARD OF PARKED LORRIES.  
 OTHERS STILL WANTED VILLAGE BENEFIT   
 BUT NOT OUTSIDE "THEIR" HOUSES.THE BOX
 FINALLY RESTS CLOSE TO IT'S OLD SITE, 
 THANKFULLY PRESERVED,NOT MODERNISED.  
  AT OVER 300 VEHICLES/hr USING THE    
 B1230 VILLAGE STREET TO REACH THE M62;
 TRAFFIC SIZE,SPEED,EROSION OF VERGES  
 AND POSSIBLE FUTURE ROAD WIDENING TO  
 ADD TO SOME ALREADY DONE,WORRY 37% OF 
 VILLAGERS.SPEED LIMITS ARE IGNORED AND
 PARKING OUTSIDE PUBS ADDS EXTRA DANGER
  THESE PUBS ARE A HUB OF ENTERTAINMENT
 CLOSE TO THE MUCH APPRECIATED VILLAGE 
 HALL.CHEAPER TO HIRE THAN THE "SCHOOL"
 HALL PEOPLE BELIEVE IT HAS A BETTER   
 ATMOSPHERE FOR LOCAL PERFORMANCES.    </content>
