		<title>20Shopping: Pateley</title>
		<content>  Most of the shop buildings in Pateley
 Bridge date back to the last century  
 and run up both sides of the High     
 Street. There is a reasonable variety 
 of shops such as a glass engraver, a  
 gun shop, a watchmaker and a shop     
 where enamelled jewellery is made.    
  There is an ironmonger's shop, which 
 sells kitchen hardware and tools.Two  
 small supermarkets sell a wide range  
 of food and household necessities. One
 shop supplies everything for dress-   
 making such as patterns, zips and     
 fabric. There are three hairdressers, 
 which are quite well attended by the  
 local folk. A small chemist deals with
 doctors' prescriptions and sells      
 herbs, ointments and alcoholic drinks.
 The one shoe shop also sells fishing  
 tackle and licences for fishing on the
 river Nidd. The two butchers also sell
 game, poultry and homemade pies.      </content>
