		<title>04FARMING 2. LAND UTILIZATION</title>
		<content> On page3 we have seen the reasons for 
 mixed "family" farming. Let us now    
 examine what may be seen on the land  
 in 1985. Cereal crops predominate the 
 fertile ground; wheat and barley. More
 recently, however, "oil seed rape" has
 been introduced. This valuable source 
 of vegetable oil is profitable and the
 fields of bright yellow will be a     
 feature of the landscape for some time
 to come. Where the land is unsuitable 
 for crops, cattle and sheep are past_ 
 ured. Horses and ponies are also to be
 seen thus explaining the occasional   
 fields of hay.                        
 Root crops such as potatoes &amp; turnips 
 are also grown.                       
 Where the soil is unsuitable for the  
 plough, steep ground/patches of thick 
 glacial drift, areas of mixed woodland
 are left, often providing windbreaks.
