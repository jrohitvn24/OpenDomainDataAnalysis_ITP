		<content> There are several                     
 voluntarily-organised activities for  
 the elderly.The Golden Link is a      
 Senior Citizens' Club with members in 
 several Cotswold villages,including   
 Salperton and Hampen.The meetings are 
 held monthly in village halls or      
 private houses. There is a weekly Day 
 centre at Brockhampton,and members of 
 Shipton Oliffe Womens' Institute have 
 installed a loop system in their      
 village hall so that a Hard-of-Hearing
 Club can meet there .The Voluntary    
 Help Service at Moreton organises     
 private transport for these           
 activities.The Cotswold District      
 Council gives 7 in travel tokens to  
 senior citizens.Most people use them  
 for bus journeys.
