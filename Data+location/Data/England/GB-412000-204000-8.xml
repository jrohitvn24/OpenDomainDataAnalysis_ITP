		<content>   An artesian well is formed when a

 trapped at high pressure beneath it.  
 If a hole is drilled through the rock 
 then the water will rise up the bore  
 hole .Should the pressure be great    
 enough the water will be forced high  
 into the air.                         
  In Hatherop there is an artesian     
 well.It was drilled around the turn of
 the century . The pressure was so     
 great that the water created a        
 fountain forty foot high.             
  Several engineers  tried without     
 success to pump the water around the  
 farms and estate houses. The man who  
 succeded was named Godwin and his

 Quenington .
