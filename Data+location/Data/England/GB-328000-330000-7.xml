 The child who had been in the ward the
 longest had been completely paralysed 
 in a car accident.He could move his   
 head slightly and talk softly.However 
 with the aid of                       
 computers,television,word processors  
 and a whole range of tools made       
 especially for him by the hospital    
 dentist he could communicate and do   
 lessons.The mouthpieces consisted of  
 plastic moulded into the shape of his 
 mouth and metal prongs which seperated
 the keys of the typewriter.He was     
 permanetly connected to a breathing   
 machine.Around his bed he had lots of 
 interesting pictures,cards and        
 photographs. One showed the{Duchess of
{Kent,}the patron of the hospital      
 visiting him,another showed{John      
{Biffen}the local Member of Parliament.</content>
