		<content> The{school building}is made of brick  
 covered with{pebble dash.}There are   
{two large classrooms}with a dining    
 room between. Behind this is a        
 painting room, a small classroom next 
 door and an Office where the Secretary
 and Headteacher work. The Junior      
 classroom is rectangular. There are 16
 double desks for children and one for 
 the teacher. Cupboards, shelves, a    
 piano, television and a computer      
 occupy the rest of the room. 31       
 children work here. 22 children work  
 in the infant room sitting at desks or
 tables. The kitchen adjoins this room.
 Everyone eats dinner at school. 3     
 children bring their own food. Every_ 
 one else eats dinners cooked in the   
 school kitchen by our{superb cook!}Our
 favourite meal is Shepherd's Pie with 
 raw  carrots, and Volcano Pudding that
 is like a mountain with jam all over. </content>
