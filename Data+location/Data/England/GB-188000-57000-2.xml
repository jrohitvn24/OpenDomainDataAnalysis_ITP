		<content> There is only one school in this      
 district.It is called Indian Queens   
 County Primary School and it is on the
 Suncrest Estate.It was built and      
 opened in 1980 to take the place of   
 the school that was built out along   
 the A30 in 1878.In the Summer Term    
 1985 there were 156 full time pupils  
 from 5 to 11,and 52 in the Nursery    
 Unit.The Nursery Unit has children    
 part time from 3years old to 5 years  
 old.Our school is much better than the
 old school because it is much warmer  
 in winter,and has a hall and a lot of 
 playing fields.There is a Headmaster  
 and four full time teachers in the    
 main school building,and a nursery    
 teacher and a nursery assistant in the
 Nursery Unit.When children are 11 they
 leave and go to Treviglas School in   
 Newquay.They have to go by bus.School 
 dinners are cooked in the kitchen.    </content>
