		<content> His Highness Prince Frederick Duleep  
 Singh lived at Old Buckenham Hall for 
 several years up to 1906.  He was     
 nicknamed 'The Black Prince' and is   
 remembered as a generous man who      
 helped restore the Ancient House      
 Museum in Thetford so that it could be
 opened to the public.                 
                                       
 Lionel Robinson was a wealthy         
 Australian businessman who lived at   
 Old Buckenham Hall from 1906 - 1922.  
 His most celebrated achievement was   
 when he arranged for the Australian   
 Touring Team of 1921 to play a        
 representative English XI on the      
 cricket ground he had made at the     
 hall. England declared with 256 runs  
 (Hobbs 85 retired hurt), rain stopped 
 play and the match was declared a     
 draw.
