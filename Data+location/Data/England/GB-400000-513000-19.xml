		<title>19Typical Home Life in 1985</title>
		<content>  On a typical Saturday I get up to see
 what the weather is like.In summer,if 
 it's fine,I like to swim in the river.
 First though,I put on my jeans and T- 
 shirt and eat breakfast(usually toast)
 In winter,if there is snow,I watch    
 T.V.or go sledging.In the afternoons  
 I like to play football with my mates.
 Sometimes I act as caddie for my dad  
 when he plays golf in Barnard Castle. 
 It takes about 3 hours for him to play
 a complete round of 18 holes.I even   
 clean his shoes for him (a hard job   
 because of the spikes in the sole).   
  Tea-time is when we all have a snack 
 meal with sandwiches and cake.Later I 
 switch on the T.V.I like Grange Hill, 
 which is a programme about a school.I 
 enjoy watching sport as well.Sometimes
 I like to read adventure books.Usually
 I go to bed at about nine o'clock and 
 continue reading for a short while.   </content>
