		<content>      His day starts at 5.00 a.m. with 
 a mall breakfast.   He then walks to  
work at about 6.00 a.m.   He works at  
Unipart as a fork-lift-truck driver    
lifting up pallets of batteries, spark-
plugs, radios, paint, gearboxes,       
fan-belts, oil filters, seat-covers    
etc.   He has lunch at about l2.30.    
The lunch-break ends at l.00 p.m.      
He finishes work at 4.00 p.m., but some
times works overtime for anything up to
two hours.   When he comes home he has 
a cup of tea and something to eat.     
Then he usually works in the garden    
mowing the lawn or weeding or planting 
some flowers.   Sometimes he works in  
the greenhouse.   When he comes in he  
usually watches television.   The news 
is normally on which he enjoys and he  
watches the weather forecast to see    
what the weather will be like on the   
next day.   Then he goes to bed.       </content>
