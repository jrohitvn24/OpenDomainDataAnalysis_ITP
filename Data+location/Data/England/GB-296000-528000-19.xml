		<content> I interviewed my mam, who went to     
 school during the Second World War.   
 She told me that she could remember   
 many children in school having scarlet
 fever. There were no{computers}and    
 sometimes they would write with{chalk 
{on a slate.    }                      
 At home they had no proper bath and on
 bath nights she got bathed in a{tin   
{bath}which was hung on a nail in the  
 backyard. There were no automatic     
 washing machines and her mother used  
 to use a{'poss stick'}in a large tub  
 and then put the clothes through a    
 hand{mangle}to remove the surplus     
 water.                                
 She can remember using an{air raid    
{shelter}under the Imperial grounds and
 listening to tales about 'Galloping   
 Harry' who rode through Hall Park     
 grounds with his head under his arm.
