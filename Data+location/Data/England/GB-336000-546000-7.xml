		<content>   There are two main factories in     
 Dalston, one being Nestle's and the   
 other being the Cotton Wool Mill. The 
 main difference is the number of      
 employees. Nestle's employs around 300
 while the Mill employs 42.            
   The Cotton Wool Mill produces       
 different sorts of cotton wool.       
 Nestle's produces milk powder for     
 middle eastern countries like Saudi   
 Arabia, Iran and Israel.              
   There has been a major decline in   
 employment since the early nineteenth 
 century. Figures released then showed 
 that there were eight hundred and     
 eighty people employed in Dalston. But
 there was a lot more factories like   
 corn mills  and ironmongers. There are
 a few little companies at Buckabank.  
 One is Norflex, a land drainage       
 company, and one of the others is The 
 Cookhouse, a catering company.        </content>
