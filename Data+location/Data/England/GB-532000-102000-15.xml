		<title>15SOCIAL CONCERNS : THE AREAS</title>
		<content>       The area of our Domesday survey 
 is a very varied one and we found     
 different problems in 3 quite distinct
 sections, Queen's Park, Whitehawk and 
 Kemptown.{Whitehawk}is a very large   
 council estate which has had a bad    
 reputation for vandalism and crime in 
 the past and in which the housing was 
 in need of repair, as is reported in  
 the local press.{Queen's Park}is a    
 middle-class residential area in which
 there are many large, well-kept       
 Victorian houses around a well        
 maintained park.{Kemptown}has some of 
 the most elegant houses in Brighton   
 but also many small flats and some    
 delapidated property.                 
       The image of these regions which
 are very close to each other is very  
 different but our survey found social 
 concerns were not always the obvious  
 ones.                                 </content>
