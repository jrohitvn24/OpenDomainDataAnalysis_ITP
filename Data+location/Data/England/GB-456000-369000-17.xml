		<title>17Improving Cuckney Churchyard</title>
		<content> The young people of the Community Task
 Force are working in Cuckney church,  
 the chuchyard and the church hall.Some
 are repairing and building up the     
 stone wall of the church.             
  In the yard they are moving the      
 headstones and leaning them up against
 the church wall.They are also mowing  
 the grass over the graves and have    
 planted bulbs on each side of the path
 to the church door.They are also      
 digging to reveal the ditch of the old
 Motte and Bailey castle which used to 
 stand on the site and they are shoring
 up the sides with stone .             
    The Church Hall is being repaired  
 and borders are being dug on either   
 side of it .                          
 The whole area looks much smarter than
 it did in 1984 when the Task Force    
 began and the work should be finished 
 by August 23rd 1985.                  </content>
