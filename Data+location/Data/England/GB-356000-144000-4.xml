		<content> The land is predominantly             
{pastoral,}except where steepness of   
 slope (Lower Biddle Combe, King's     
 Castle) has made cultivation          
 impracticable and so{woodland}remains 
 to form an attractive patchwork. The  
 farms are mostly part of{large estates
 which may have been part of cathedral 
 lands (e.g. Chilcote{prebendal manor).
 Formerly sheep farming and the wool   
 industry were dominant, but railways  
 in the 1860s led to the growth of     
 dairying.  Now largely{milk, beef, and
{lamb fattening,}with a recent increase
 in{cereals}(assisted by E.E.C. grants)
 with{market garden/fruit growing}on   
 the alluvial soils of the sheltered   
 Sheppey Valley.Post_war{suburban Wells
 is fringed by an expanding{golf course
 and large{hospital}grounds.  Villages 
 lie along the Sheppey, with only one  
 hamlet and some farms on the hills.   </content>
