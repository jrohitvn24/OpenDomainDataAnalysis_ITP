		<title>20Hogsthorpe Church.</title>
		<content> St.Mary's Church at Hogsthorpe is     
 built mainly from Ancaster Stone.It is
 partly Norman and Early English in    
 style.Repair work in red brick spoils 
 its looks.Inside is a rare unusual    
 carved{corbell}head with a band across
 nose and chin.At the West end of the  
 Church is a stained glass window of   
 "OUR LORD BLESSING LITTLE CHILDREN".  
 Inside the Churches large tower are 6 
 bells.Unfortunately,the ancient beams 
 hoding the bells are now weak so      
 instead of being rung by ropes        
 normally,pulleys and ropes ring them  
 by hammers striking the bells which   
 are fixed so they can't move.The{pipe}
{organ}pumped by Thomas S Jones and Son
 of Holloway,London.                   
 In 1851 a religious census said 150   
 people were regulars at Sunday        
 Services.Today its about 25 to 30.
