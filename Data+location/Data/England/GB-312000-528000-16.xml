		<title>16Town Twinning - Cockermouth</title>
		<content> In 1983 Cockermouth was 'twinned' with
 Marvejols, of similar population in   
 the Lozere Department of France.      
 Marvejols is a market town with       
 agricultural, forestry and quarrying  
 interests. Initial Town Council       
 contacts resulted in reciprocal visits
 by secondary school students and      
 mental hospital staff and             
 patients. West Cumbria College        
 students  have visited France for work
 experience and the Cockermouth        
 Mechanic's Band has performed         
 there. Many informal visits have been 
 made to Cockermouth and Marvejols and 
 in 1985 a party will visit France to  
 celebrate the second anniversary.     
 Planned events include a second visit 
 by the Mechanic's Band, a visit by    
 the "Majorettes" (a marching band) for
 the Cockermouth Carnival in 1986 and  
 exchange visits by sports teams.      </content>
