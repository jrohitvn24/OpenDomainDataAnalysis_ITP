		<title>01The area SE of Gainsborough.</title>
		<content> This area of land is predominantly    
 agricultural.The agriculture is       
 dominated by the production of cereal 
 crops although some dairy herds,and to
 a lesser extent,flocks of sheep,can   
 still be found.                       
 Farming is a large scale operation and
 most farms have amalgamated as they   
 have been purchased by commercial     
 orginisations.                        
 The area consists of four small       
 villages;very little industry;one     
 primary school(the others having      
 closed);one garage;narrow roads(some  
 dating back to{Roman}times);large     
 fields devoted to the production of   
 cereal crops;a flat sometimes gently  
 rolling landscape;few shops;a lack of 
 hedges;large isolated farm houses;well
 visited public houses;many            
 bungalows;little public transport.
