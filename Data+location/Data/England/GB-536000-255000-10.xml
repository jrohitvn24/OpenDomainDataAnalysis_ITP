		<title>10SCHOOL TRANSPORT</title>
		<content> We need school buses so that children 
 in outlying villages can get to school
 from their homes .                    
  The LEA provides school buses for    
 those who live beyond a certain       
 distance from the school.There are    
 two buses starting from Hardwick and  
 Everesden picking up children from    
 Kingston and Toft on their way in.    
  Those who live outside the catchment 
 area must supply their own transport  
 or go to  a different school.         
  The LEA gives you an free yearly or  
 termly pass to use on these buses.    
  We have used school buses for fifteen
 years since 1970 when the school      
 opened.The children who come on school
 buses often find it difficult to stay 
 for after-school activities, unless   
 their parents come to collect them.   
  The school buses we use are, WHIPPIT,
 MYALLS and CAMBUS.                    </content>
