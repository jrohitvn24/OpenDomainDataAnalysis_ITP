		<title>18Wet wellies and a Kingfisher</title>
		<content> Instead of Tom, Mummy and Cherry      
 staying on the edge of the stream,    
 they came into the water and Tom got a
 piggy back on Mummy all the way. The  
 water came over our boots and Gemma   
 fell in and got wet. First it was deep
 and then it was shallow and Cherry    
 tucked her skirt in her knickers and  
 me and Jamie were in the lead. We     
 collected a lot of things. We saw a   
 kingfisher and it went round the      
 corner of the stream. We followed the 
 kingfisher until the water got too    
 deep, then we went back the way we    
 came, got out, climbed an electric    
 fence and went home. We were very     
 tired.
