		<title>19THE NAZE TOWER</title>
		<content> The Naze Tower has six windows and    
 was built in 1720 by Trinity House to 
 provide a landmark for boats.It is 82 
 feet or 25.70 metres high with 6      
 floors and a seventh floor and a roof 
 reached by a ladder.The tower stands  
 on the highest point of the headland, 
 162 feet above the high water level.It
 is 100 metres from the cliff top and  
 the circumference of the tower        
 measures 18.87 metres.Near the Naze   
 Tower on the beach are two pill boxes 
 they were built from 1938-39.As the   
 cliffs have been eroded over the years
 the pill boxes have slipped down the  
 cliffs and are now 71 metres from the 
 cliff top.
