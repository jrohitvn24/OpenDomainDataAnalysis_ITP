		<title>20Ecology-Dymchurch Beach</title>
		<content> The beach is sandy with large blocks  
 of stone under the sea wall.The few   
 pebbles have been gradually pushed by 
 currents from West of Dungeness.Gran- 
 ite &amp; sandstone are the most common   
 pebbles.Smoothed glass,brick,coal &amp;   
 cuttlebone are easy to find.No seaweed
 grows in the sea by Dymchurch because 
 the water is too shallow.Breakers are 
 placed at regular intervals to check  
 the force of the waves on the sea     
 wall.Many forms of sea life are found 
 in little pools:crab,lugworm,weaver-  
 fish,dabs,flounder,sand-eels &amp;        
 shrimps.There are a few jellyfish.Com-
 mon whelk,dog whelk,razorshell,peri-  
 winkle &amp; cockle are shells commonly   
 found on the beach.There are few lim- 
 pets,but many barnacles on break-     
 waters.Flotsam &amp; jetsam on the tide-  
 line include plastic bottles,orange-  
 peel,oil cans &amp; polystirene cups.     </content>
