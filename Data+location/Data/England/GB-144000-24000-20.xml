		<title>20Mousehole Harbour (2)</title>
		<content>     In earlier times the harbour had  
 to be enlarged to accomodate the      
 fishing fleet of about 40 sailing     
 boats in the 1850's but today there is
 only one boat sailing from{Mousehole  
 engaged in fishing. This boat is the  
{'Talisman',}but although it is engaged
 in fishing, it is mainly involved with
 taking trippers or visitors on longer 
 daily fishing trips for sharks, or    
 shorter trips to catch mackeral in    
{Mounts Bay.                           
                                       
     At this point thanks must be      
 recorded to{Mr. Mike Reynolds and his 
{family}for information about          
 Mousehole and the various activities  
 available to the local community.     
 Also thanks to{Andrew Walton and Clive
{Symons of St. Paul's School}for       
 helping in the survey, amenity count  
 and some of the typing.               </content>
