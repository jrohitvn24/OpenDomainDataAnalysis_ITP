		<title>17SIBSON AIRFIELD</title>
		<content>  A sizeable part of the south-west    
 corner of the Stibbington area        
 contains the landing ground for Sibson
 Airfield. The airfield buildings      
 contain the Peterborough Parachute    
 Centre and the Peterborough Aero club 
 and hangars house several small planes
 and gliders.                          
  The landing ground which covers over 
 300 acres serves as the target area   
 for parachutists. The experts can     
 often be seen gently floating to the  
 ground, steering their 'chutes to land
 on the sand pit in the centre of the  
 landing area, whilst more commonly the
 novices tumble groundwards hoping to  
 land somewhere in the 300 acres. The  
 unfortunates who do not succeed may   
 find themselves on a road or a roof,  
 in a pig farm or in a tree!           
  Flying and parachuting activities    
 draw increasing numbers of visitors.  </content>
