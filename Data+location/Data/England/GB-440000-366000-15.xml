		<title>15THE ALLOTMENTS IN GRASSMOOR.</title>
		<content> An allotment is an area of land which 
 can be rented from the council by     
 people who are interested in growing  
 flowers and vegetables. The secretary 
 of the Grassmoor Allotment Association
 said they were first started in 1913. 
 Gardeners get either a small plot of  
 300 square metres or a larger one     
 twice the size.                       
 There are many glass greenhouses      
 growing tomatoes, cucumbers and a few 
 melons. There are patches of mint,    
 sage and parsley and some fruit bushes
 like raspberries, strawberries, black 
 currants, redcurrants and gooseberries
 One gardener has planted a large patch
 of tobacco plants and was going to    
 prepare the leaves for smoking in his 
 pipe. Almost every type of vegetable  
 is grown and many plots are filled    
 with chrysanthemums. Competitions are 
 held to see who grows the best plants.</content>
