		<title>06BIRTHDAY PARTY,COTEHILL</title>
		<content> On Friday night when school had       
 finished I went home for my sister    
 Carole's party.She had 7 friends for  
 her party.When she got home she opened
 her presents then we went for the     
 party tea.Everyone had plenty eat.I   
 said to Laura,"Someone will come along
 with a needle and pop you."I said that
 to Laura because she ate so much.After
 tea we played games. The first game we
 played was pass the parcel.The parcel 
 had a sweet in nearly every wrapping  
 you took off.When Lisa got a sweet she
 gave it to someone else.When the pass 
 the parcel had finished we had a game 
 of musical statues then musical bumps.
 We went out to play on the swings then
 it was time to go home.               
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
