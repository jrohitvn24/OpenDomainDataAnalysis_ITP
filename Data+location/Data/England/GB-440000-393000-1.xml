		<content> Most peoples mum and dad work during  
 the week mainly in the town. It is    
 common in familys that the men go to  
 work in the car and the women go to   
 work on the bus.                      
  A few people have moved to           
 Kimberworth because they had wanted a 
 bigger house.                         
  Most people get up at 7:15am to go to
 school or to go to work.              
  On Saturday and Sunday people relax  
 and do there hobbies. Some children   
 who go to our school (Old Hall        
 Comprehensive) go horse riding at     
 Barley Hall Riding School at Thorpe   
 Hesley. Some people have dogs,cats or 
 fish to keep as pets.                 
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
