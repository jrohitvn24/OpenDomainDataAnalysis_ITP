		<title>01OVER WYRESDALE: INTRODUCTION</title>
		<content>    This area lies in the parishes of  
 Over Wyresdale, Nether Wyresdale and  
 Ellel in north Lancashire, in the     
 parliamentary borough of Lancaster.   
 Bordering the villages of Dolphinholme
 to the west and Abbeystead to the east
 it lies south of Lancaster, about 10  
 kilometres from the coast. It is      
 drained westward by tne river Wyre.   
    It is a sparsely populated rural   
 area,with a strong community feeling. 
 The settlement consists mainly of     
 scattered farms with some more        
 recently built houses in the west. A  
 few of the farmers own their land but 
 many of the others are tenants of the 
 Grosvenor Estates. Most of this land  
 is cultivated grassland used for      
 feeding sheep or cattle but there is  
 also a large area of woodland managed 
 primarily as cover for gamebirds.     
    There is no industry in this area. </content>
