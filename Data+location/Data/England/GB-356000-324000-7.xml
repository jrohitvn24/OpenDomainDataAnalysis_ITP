 There is a fair range of habitats     
 within our study area, some natural   
 others man made.  The River Roden, a  
 narrow non navigable waterway flows   
 quite fast so there are few surface   
 plants but the banks are lush and     
 overhung by trees notably Alders and  
 Willows.  The woodland in our area is 
 largely manmade and carefully managed 
 on behalf of Sir Algernon Heber-Percy,
 who in turn leases the land from his  
 father-in-law Lord Leverhulme. They   
 are mixed woodlands, well coppiced and
 managed by a gamekeeper who informed  
 us that there is an abundance of      
 badgers and foxes despite frequent    
 hunting by The North Shropshire Hunt. 
 Within our area is a fairly           
 undisturbed area of common grassland  
 which is home to rabbits and other    
 small mammals.                        </content>
