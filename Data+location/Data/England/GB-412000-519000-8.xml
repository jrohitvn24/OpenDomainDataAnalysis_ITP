		<content> There are nine farms in the area      
 studied and the general pattern of    
 farming is mixed with each individual 
 farm being farmed with a different    
 bias. Two farms were studied in more  
 depth, one of these concentrated more 
 on dairying with the other on sheep   
 and beef. Alwent is a mixed farm of   
 135 acres, and is worked by the       
 Williams family. Grass is grown for   
 hay and silage and corn for feeding   
 the animals. Mr Williams keeps Masham 
 sheep for meat and wool. The lambs are
 sold at around 12 weeks old. He mainly
 has Herefords in his herd of cattle.  
 He keeps bulls and bullocks which are 
 sold as fat cattle at around 18 months
 old. Warren hens are also kept for    
 their eggs which are sold locally. The
 hens are productive for two years and 
 are then sold.                        
 High Hulam farm comprises 212 acres.  </content>
