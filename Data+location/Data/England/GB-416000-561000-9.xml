		<title>09WINLATON TRANSPORT SURVEY</title>
		<content> In our school survey 214 children were
 asked questions  on their family      
 transport habits. 93% of children     
 owned a bicycle, but only 3O% of      
 parents did. 7O% of families owned a  
 car, and 15% had more than one. Very  
 few had motor cycles. Most children   
 walked to school each day, about 75%, 
 but 15% came by car, and about 1O% by 
 bus.                                  
 Out of 33O parents who worked, 4O%    
 travelled to work in their own cars,  
 while 25% used a bus. 15% had lifts to
 work and 15% walked.                  
 In 1984 over 7O% of children went on  
 holiday for at least one week. 39% had
 more than one holiday. 7O% of these   
 travelled abroad, equal proportions by
 sea and air. Children taking holidays 
 in the U.K. mainly travelled by car.
