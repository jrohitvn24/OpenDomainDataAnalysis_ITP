		<title>05DALLINGTON WINDMILL</title>
		<content> The Dallington windmill was built in  
 1851/2 for Mr Albert Geering.It was a 
 white fantail smockmill.It was in a   
 field just 200 yards northeast of the 
 village church.The land was leased    
 from the Ashburnham Estate,and        
 Upfields of Warbleton were employed to
 erect the white wooden smock on a     
 tarred two_storey brick base.A sale   
 notice in the Sussex weekly Advertiser
 for 2nd of August 1881 gives this as  
 "An exceedingly well built smock mill 
 situated near Dallington Street".It is
 in good order and condition,built of  
 the best materials driving two pairs  
 of stones,fitted with a grain cracking
 mill,the usual machinery,and has      
 patent sweeps plus brick and tile     
 stables for three horses and a van    
 lodge.Sometime during late 1913,the   
 smock was pulled down leaving the base
 and buildings standing.               </content>
