		<title>04 RIVER OTTER &amp; FLOOD PLAIN</title>
		<content>Today the Otter provides a pleasant    
riverside walk,popular at weekends &amp;   
during holidays,but in the past,it was 
essential to the economy of the area.Up
to about 1450,it was navigable to      
Otterton(then a fishing village) and a 
wharf at Budleigh Haven(E.Bud's "port")
handled wool &amp; general merchandise.    
Silting up since the 1800's has removed
trading possibilities.The flood plain  
here is about 0.5km wide &amp; contrasts   
with the steep valley edge at Otterton.
It is laid to permanent pasture but is 
naturally water-meadow which was       
drained from 1815 when an embankment &amp; 
aquaduct were built to lead Budleigh   
Brook into the Otter.The Brook's course
was further altered when the railway   
came in 1897.
