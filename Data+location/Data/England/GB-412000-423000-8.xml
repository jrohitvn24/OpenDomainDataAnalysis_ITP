		<content> At Eastfield School,Stone Lane,       
 Lightcliffe there is a kind of        
 community centre called The Jubilee   
 Centre.It opens during the day for    
 adults to meet and chat.Sometimes     
 teenagers who have just left school go
 there.In the evenings the Youth Club  
 meetings are held.There are different 
 sections for Juniors and Seniors.Many 
 games and activities are available    
 such as table-tennis,snooker,and      
 darts. There is a dance floor and a   
 Disco for playing music. A small cafe 
 opens to sell food and soft drinks.   
 The secondary school uses the building
 at lunchtimes for pupils in the 4th   
 and 5th year's.They go along for      
 lunchtime recreation.Teenagers like   
 to go to the Youth Club at night as it
 provides them with a place to meet    
 their friends and it keeps them out of
 trouble.                              </content>
