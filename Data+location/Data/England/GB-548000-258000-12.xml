		<content> Mrs. Arnold became a Parish Councillor
 because she wished to become involved 
 in decisions that were being made     
 about Fen Ditton. In 1977 there was a 
 plan to develop the village and build 
 lots of factories and houses there. By
 becoming a Parish Councillor Mrs.     
 Arnold helped to frustrate those      
 plans. Her main concern now is with   
 preserving the green belt around the  
 village to prevent it from becoming a 
 suburb of Cambridge. She is also      
 active in trying to minimise the      
 damage caused and dangers posed to the
 residents by large numbers of vehicles
 passing through the village due to its
 main road being used as a slip road   
 connecting the new A45 by-pass and the
 Newmarket Road. Mrs. Arnold also      
 monitors carefully the use of         
 pesticides and insectisides by        
 farmers, especially near the school.  </content>
