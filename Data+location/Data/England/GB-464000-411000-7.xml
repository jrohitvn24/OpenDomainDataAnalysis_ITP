		<content> Stainforth Middle was built as a      
 county secondary taking pupils of 11  
 till they went to work.Eastgate and   
 Westgate First are two of the five    
 schools which send pupils there.They  
 are separate schools in one building. 
 They were built back to back and used 
 different parts of the same           
 playground. Eastgate's part was       
 bigger, which they thought unfair.    
 Eastgate thought Westgate were trouble
 -makers. Westgate threw stones so     
 Eastgate pinched coats.These schools  
 are good for teaching you how to stick
 up for yourself as grown-ups.
