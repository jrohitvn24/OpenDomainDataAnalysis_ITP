		<content> Ewelme is a small village and you have
 to come out of the village for some   
 things. I have to come out of the     
 village to get shopping and if someone
 is ill we have to go to the doctors. I
 dont usually have to catch a bus      
 because my dad has a car and my mum   
 has a car We sometimes go to the      
 cinema and                            
 we have to go out of the village for  
 that. There is a little cinema in     
 Henley which is about 10 miles away   
 from school. If my mum wants to buy   
 clothing she goes into Wallingford,   
 Henley, Oxford or Reading. Benson is  
 two miles away, Wallingford three and 
 a half, Henley ten miles, Oxford      
 fourteen miles and Reading about      
 fifteen miles from Ewelme.
