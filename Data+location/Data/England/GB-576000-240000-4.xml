  Several buildings within the village 
 are Grade 2{listed buildings}of       
 special architectural or historic     
 interest. Belchamp St. Paul has       
 recently been designated a            
{Conservation Area.}The central area of
 the village is worthy of this status  
 mainly because the wealth and         
 variety of buildings grouped around   
{Cole Green}warrent tighter            
 environmental control to prevent the  
 erosion of village character. The     
 older properties are built of local   
 materials... thatch, wattle and daub, 
 red bricks or flint.                  </content>
