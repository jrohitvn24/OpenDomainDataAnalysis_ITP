		<content>  In the centre of the village (Little 
 Weighton) there are a number of very  
 old cottages and houses, but most of  
 the housing is modern and has been    
 built within the last 40 years.       
  There are many kinds of private      
 housing,- detatched and semi-detatched
 houses and bungalows, as well as      
 semi-detatched council-owned houses,  
 making a total of nearly 300 dwellings
 altogether.                           
  There is no mains gas piped to the   
 area so most houses use either oil or 
 solid fuel (coal) for heating. All    
 houses in our survey had mains        
 electricity but this was used mainly  
 for lighting and power rather than for
 heating.                              
  All houses in our survey had a garden
 and 60% of householders grew their own
 vegetables as well as flowers.
