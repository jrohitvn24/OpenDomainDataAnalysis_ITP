		<content>  Then we walk up the field to the     
 yard.I get out my tackle and tack     
 box,from the tackroom, then I go and  
 catch her.I give her a brush over,then
 I put on the bridle and saddle.I get  
 on and give her a walk around for     
 about an hour,then I bring her in for 
 another good rub over. While I brush  
 her my mum mucks out the stable.      
  After I have given her a brush,I give
 her a reward, then I let her go.My mum
 gets my tackle and we walk down the   
 field back to the car. My mum carries 
 tackle so I can open the gate.We put  
 the tackle in the car,then get in and 
 go back home.                         
  When I get home I go and play with my
 friend.I have my dinner at her        
 house,and then we play.At 8.00p.m. my 
 dad takes the dog a walk and comes    
 to collect me. When I get back home I 
 watch the T.V and go to bed.          </content>
