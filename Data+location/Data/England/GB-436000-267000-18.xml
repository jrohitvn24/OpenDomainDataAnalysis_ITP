		<title>18THE VILLAGE OF EATHORPE</title>
		<content>     The {Population }has fallen , a   
 little. It used to be 150 people but  
 now it is only 135. Eathorpe and      
 Wappenbury's population is always     
 recorded together. There is no        
 community life as everyone is too     
 busy.                                 
     The improvements that have come to
 the village have made some changes.   
 The improvements include 3 buses a day
 and electrity instead of oil lamps.   
  When there was village life everyone 
 had children and no one was too busy  
 for the community life where as now   
 there is no spirit and all the        
 community life has gone.              
     The nearest {Doctor }used to be at
  Marton but now it is Stretton which  
 is 4 to 5 miles away.In recent years  
 everyone in the village has changed   
 and only 2 people still remain from   
 about 10 years ago.                   </content>
