		<content> Over recent decades{industries}and    
{crafts}have declined in Repton.       
 For example there used to be          
 blacksmiths, cobblers, bakers, gas    
 workers, carpenters and basket makers.
 Repton has very{old buildings}apart   
 from those belonging to the school    
 (see another block). There are two old
 houses over  400 years old. One of    
 them was lived in by Bishop Abrams in 
 Well Lane. Most of the houses in      
 the main street were built between    
 1886 and 1903.                        
 The region has few connections with   
{royalty}except for recent visits of   
 the Queen in 1952 and the Duchess of  
 Kent in 1985 and a shooting trip which
 Prince Charles is said to have made.  
 Newton Solbey has little of historic  
 interest except for two marble        
 effigies of crusaders.
