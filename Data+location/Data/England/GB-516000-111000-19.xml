		<title>19The Steyning Museum</title>
		<content> The Steyning Museum building is over  
 one hundred years old and is full of  
 lots of exciting things that are very 
 old. There are two rooms,the back one 
 full of lots of maps showing where the
 sea used to come right up to Steyning.
 The first map shows where the sea     
 used to cover Steyning and then       
 picture by picture the sea            
 subsides.The museum is also full of   
 very old coins from the 16thC. By the 
 door there is a book in which you fill
 in your name,address and what you     
 thought of the place.There are other  
 things also like a pair of old shoes  
 in very good condition. There is a    
 piece of writing which is very neat   
 and decorated nicely.                 
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
