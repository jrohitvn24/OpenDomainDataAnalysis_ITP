		<content>   Holcombe farmhouse is 275 years old,
 but the farm itself is much older. On 
 the wall, Roman numerals date it as   
 1710. The owners have lived there for 
 18 years,making some changes; the farm
 is now keeping beef cattle, but in    
 April 1985 they sold 90 milking cows. 
   Holcombe Farm has 97 acres, and Hill
 Farm has 130 acres. The machinery used
 on the farm consists of tractors,     
 trailers, mower, bailer,they also     
 have a contractor,used for silage and 
 combining.There is one paid employee  
 on the farm.                          
   The one big problem is making the   
 cattle and crops grow quickly, because
 the fertiliser and medicals are       
 expensive. One milking cow raised from
 a calf costs Â£150,with feed, which is 
 hay and cattlecake. When the crops are
 ready they are sold:if they are good  
 quality they go to different places:  </content>
