		<title>12RECREATION AND LEISURE.</title>
		<content> Our survey asked people what informal 
 Leisure Activities they did in their  
 spare time.We were surprised by the   
 range and variety.                    
 On average the amount of T.V.watching 
 is two hours per night;more in Winter.
 Children tend to watch more T.V.than  
 average and pensioners less.Adult     
 radio listening averages one hour     
 daily.Pensioners listen to more radio 
 than average and younger children     
 listen only rarely.Some teenagers tune
 in to 'pop' stations.The 'computer    
 revolution'appears to have made little
 impact in this area and only three    
 children and one adult stated that    
 they used computers at home.          
 Quite a lot of private reading is     
 done;around ten hours per week.Some   
 older people do much more than this   
 but more active pensioners prefer to  
 walk or do similar outdoor activities.</content>
