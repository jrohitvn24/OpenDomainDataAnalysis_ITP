		<content> There are two  hospitals  in the area,
 the  Royal  Orthopaedic and  Hill  Top
 Hospital.   Both   are   orthopaedic  
 hospitals. We  visited Hill Top  which
 has two wards, one  in use on weekdays
 only for  minor  operations.          
 The ward which we  visited had 20 beds
 -10 each for men and  women - with  a 
 nurses  station in the middle. A  day-
 room was available with T.V for mobile
 patients.                             
 All operations are carried out in the 
 one  theatre  and  include replacement
 of hip, knee, finger and toe joints.  
 Other departments in the hospital are:
   administration,  catering, medical  
   secretaries,  mangement  services,  
   pathology laboratory, nurses home,  
   X-ray, physiotherapy, engineering,  
   laundry  and  mortuary.             
 The  hospital is  set in  a semi-rural
 environment with panoramic views.     </content>
