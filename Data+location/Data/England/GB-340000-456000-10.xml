		<title>10BOAT-BUILDING IN OVERTON</title>
		<content>Boat-building in Overton is now carried
out on a small scale,in glass-fibre,   
mostly reproductions of traditional    
work-boats,from the days of sail,(such 
as "whammel-boats",pilot punts from    
Overton,and other "beach-boats"),whose 
design evolved in various parts of     
Britain,but are now built here.They are
mostly used for pleasure-sailing,and   
are sold all over Britain,or exported; 
previously almost all work-boats were  
for local use,although some yachts were
built here.Boats are built here today  
for fishing in the Lune and at         
Morecambe.Six 19ft.motor whammel boats,
two 30ft.trawlers,and about thirty     
12ft."punts"(boarding boats for        
trawlers),have been built in recent    
years.The established boat-building    
family was the Woodhouse family,who    
built for 200 years.The line ended with
the death of Thomas in 1985.           </content>
