		<content> The Phab Club is for physically       
 handicapped and able bodied people and
 it aims to get these people to meet   
 together.I go to the local Phab Club  
 every thursday night between 7.00 and 
 10.00p.m. It costs 30p to get in and  
 the membership fee for a year is Â£1.  
 A lady called Lorna organises the     
 club.                                 
 There are about 50 people in the Phab 
 club which does not include the staff 
 who work there. There are club nightsd
 when you go to disco's or parties at  
 posh places, for example we once went 
 to a country club for the evening. You
 also go to camp every six months This 
 May a trip is going to Colchester,last
 year they went to Gillwall Park. The  
 most enjoyable thing that we do is    
 taking the physically handicapped     
 swimming - I think that it is an      
 excellent night out.                  </content>
