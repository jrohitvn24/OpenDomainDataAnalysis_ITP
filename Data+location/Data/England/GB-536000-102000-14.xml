 Leisure choice is wide with activities
 to suit most people. For adults there 
 are the Community Centres, the        
 Libraries, the Public Houses, cafes   
 and restaurants. For children there   
 are Youth Clubs, Scouts and Brownies, 
 dancing classes and Red Cross. Many   
 residents find wider opportunities    
 which are available in Brighton.  Much
 outdoor recreation is geared to       
 summertime. People of all ages choose 
 tennis, bowling, swimming or Cricket  
 Matches at Rottingdean, which has been
 active since 1758. The beaches are    
 some of the most attractive in the    
 vicinity. Many residents enjoy the    
 undercliff walk or a game of 'pitch   
 and putt' near the windmill.
