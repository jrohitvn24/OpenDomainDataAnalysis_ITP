		<title>04LIVING IN AN OAST HOUSE</title>
		<content> Hops for beer making are dried in an  
 Oast House. Fewer hops are grown now  
 so many of these houses have been     
 converted into dwellings. My house,   
 built in 1830 and converted in about  
 1915, consists of a roundel and a     
 square part. A winding staircase      
 carries you up to three floors in the 
 roundel. Dormer windows project from  
 circular walls and the tiled kiln, on 
 top of which used to stand a wooden   
 cowl, open one side. The house faces  
 south and west, overlooking farmland. 
 The walls in the roundel, 19" thick,  
 are made of Kentish Ragstone and      
 Flint. The rooms are warm in winter   
 and cool in summer. The bathroom is a 
 section taken out of the first floor  
 round bedroom and the kitchen is a    
 modern addition, built in 1954. We    
 have some difficulty trying to arrange
 furniture in a round room.            </content>
