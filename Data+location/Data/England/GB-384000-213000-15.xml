 area and is used by village football  
 and cricket teams. There are two      
 tennis courts for the use of villagers
 many of whom belong to the thriving   
 tennis club. A children's play area   
 with swings, seesaw, climbing         
 apparatus and a slide near the tennis 
 courts. Every Sunday a meeting of the 
 athletics club is held at the infants 
 school field. It's open to anyone     
 interested. The joining fee is '1.00  
 and 20 pence per week. People from the
 village run it and it covers all kinds
 of sport activities.
