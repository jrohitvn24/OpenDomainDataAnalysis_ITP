		<title>10DEVIL'S DYKE</title>
		<content> Many years ago,a legend was told about
 how the{Devils Dyke}was made.The      
 people living in Sussex at that time  
 were very religious and the Devil was 
 very angry about this.So he planned to
 dig a huge Dyke from the{Weald}to the 
 coast.When the tide came in,the{Weald 
 would be flooded.That night he set to 
 work,using a big shovel and he had to 
 finish by the morning.Meanwhile,an old
 widow woman couldn't sleep and she    
 woke up and lit a candle and placed it
 on her window sill.The Devil saw this 
 light and thought it was the sun      
 rising so he threw down his shovel and
 rushed back to Hell.He never returned 
 but there is a mound at the bottom of 
 the  Dyke where people say his shovel 
 is buried.                            
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
