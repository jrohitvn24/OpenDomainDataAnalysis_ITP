		<title>09CHURCH FARM,MONKTON FARLEIGH</title>
		<content>  On Friday 7th June a group of us went
 to interview Mr. and Mrs. Tucker at   
{ Church Farm, Monkton Farleigh.}It is 
 called Church Farm because its next to
 the{Church.}The main farm building is 
 about 400 years old. It was built in  
 1593. The farm has belonged to the    
 Tuckers since 1927.Before that their  
 relatives the Cottles owned it. The   
{land use}is mostly {arable}(wheat and 
 barley). They have 53 acres, 7 fields,
 and a lot of{animals}like : cows,     
 pigs, sheep, horses, a goat- and      
 turkeys...before Christmas!!!.        
   They have a lot of{farm machinery}on
 the farm such as tractors, a plough,  
 corndrill, harrows, a hedge cutter and
 a roller. Mr.and Mrs.Tucker like      
 farming but its hard{work.}They do not
 employ any other people.
