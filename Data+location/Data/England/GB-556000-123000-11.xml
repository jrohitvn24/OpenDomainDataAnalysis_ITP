		<content> Carnations are the dominating plant in
 many of the glasshouses.Various other 
 plants include : Geraniums,Gazina and 
 Lobelia.The plants are arranged in    
 grids to keep them straight and to    
 provide growing space.                
    The workers use potash (potassium  
 phosphate)and nitrogen as fertilizer. 
 They also use dung.                   
    The main disease that threatens    
 Carnations is Potrytis.The other main 
 problems include condensation,which is
 the cause of Potrytis,and greenfly.   
    The plants in winter need a steady 
 temperature of about 50 degrees c. to 
 survive.In summer the temperature in  
 the glasshouses must be above 100     
 degrees c.These temperatures are      
 obtained by the opening and closing of
 air vents which stabilize the         
 temperature.Heat is provided by hot   
 water pipes in the glasshouses.       </content>
