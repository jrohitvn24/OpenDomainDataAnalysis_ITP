		<title>07THE YEW,FENSTANTON CHURCH</title>
		<content>{   The yew tree's}berries and leaves  
 are very poisonous if you get them in 
 your mouth and they are poisonous for 
 animals too but not for birds.        
    Because{the yew}is a birds home the
 birds feed on the berries from it.    
    The bark from{the yew}is made into 
 bows and arrows to fight with.        
    Some yews are very old and some    
 older than the churches.The{yew}guards
 the church because the vicar doesn't  
 like animals coming in the church     
 during a session so the{yew}keeps them
 away because the farm animals don't go
 near the church in case they get      
 poisoned.                             
     The{yew}in our churchyard is like 
 a den.                                
     The{yew}in our churchyard's trunk 
 measures{185}centimetres around and   
 the height of the tree is{8 metres.
