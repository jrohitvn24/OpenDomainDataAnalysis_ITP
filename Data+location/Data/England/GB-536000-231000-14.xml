		<title>14ARTS AND CRAFTS IN WYDDIAL</title>
		<content>  At Wyddial Hall Mrs. Boyd_Carpenter  
 is a professional embroiderer. She has
 no formal qualification but has worked
 at the Cambridge County Centre , where
 art and craft courses are held. Her   
 speciality is gold work. Since 1969   
 she has undertaken commissions for    
 ecclesiastical work. These included   
 the copes and mitres worn by Dr.      
 Robert Runcie Archbishop of Canterbury
 for his enthronement and for the      
 wedding of H.R.H. Prince of Wales in  
 1977, also a cope for Wheathamstead   
 Church, work for Salem Church in      
 Broughton and an altar frontal for    
 York Minster. She is just beginning   
 five copes for Canterbury Cathedral.  
 Only for very large items such as the 
 York altar frontal does she enlist    
 help.
