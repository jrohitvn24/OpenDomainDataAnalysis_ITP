		<content> Most of the housing is in the form of 
 farmhouses and most of them date from 
 more than 100 years ago. They are     
 largely built from local materials    
 both stone and slate. There has been  
 very little new housing as this is    
 strictly controlled by the planning   
 authority, The Lake District Special  
 Planning Board. Many of the farms have
 new buildings for housing stock       
 erected with grant aid from the E.E.C.
 and these are of steel clad           
 construction. The only                
 non-agricultural houses are a few     
 converted farms for residential use,  
 the Blacksmiths Arms pub (also a small
 farm), the church and an increasing   
 number of holiday homes owned by      
 'offcomers' which are only inhabited  
 for part of the year. One of these is 
 the old water mill which still has its
 wheel, now inoperative.               </content>
