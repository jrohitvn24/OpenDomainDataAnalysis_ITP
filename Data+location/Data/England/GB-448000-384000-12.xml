		<title>12Housing in North Anston</title>
		<content> The oldest cottages and houses were   
 built with local limestone. The roofs 
 have either red tiles or grey slates. 
 Most of these houses are on Main      
 Street and around The Green. A lot of 
 them used to be farmers' dwellings.   
 They are modernised now. New housing  
 estates have grown around the old part
 of the village,most of them are brick.
 The first{council houses}were built in
 the 1930s but most in the 1950s and   
 1960s. Recent housing is on Limekilns.
 They are luxury{private houses}and    
 every house is a different style. Many
 are built in limestone to blend with  
 the older property. We did a small    
 survey of the types of houses in which
 junior school children live. The      
 majority live in{semi-detached houses 
 (63%), then{detached}(18%),{terraced  
 (16%), and a few children live in     
 bungalows, farmhouses and cottages.   </content>
