		<content>   In Blofield Heath there is a youth  
 club for young people between 8 and 12
 held each week in the Community       
 Centre, when there is music and games 
 such as table tennis and pool.        
   A new venture playground is being   
 built, with new swings, climbing      
 frames and similar apparatus, and much
 money for this has been raised by     
 fetes and jumble sales.               
   There used to be a youth club for   
 older children, held on a Wednesday   
 evening, but this closed in the       
 summer of 1984, due to a lack of      
 support and a certain amount of       
 prejudice against teenagers, as their 
 activities were thought likely to     
 disturb the neighbourhood.
