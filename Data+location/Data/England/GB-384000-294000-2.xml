		<content>   A low ridge in the east looks down  
onto a broad shallow valley carrying   
theStaffs-Worcs canal. The western     
hills are divided by Smestow Brook and 
a small dip between Seisdon and        
Trescott. The underlying geology is    
mainly Bunter Sandstone with some      
Keuper sandstone capping the Orton     
Hills.   To the north of Wombourne,    
Boulder Clay can be found along with   
many "erratic" stones.  There are some 
alluvial deposits in the valley.       
   The climate is generally moderate,  
although temperatures of -13 C (1940 &amp; 
1963) and 32 C (1943) have been        
recorded.  It doesn't often reach these
extremes.                              
   The rainfall is about 27 inches per 
year on average.
