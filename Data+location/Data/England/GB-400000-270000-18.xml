		<content>     The Breakdancing and the Robotics 
 will take place early in the          
 afternoon. Following this is the      
 school gymnastics which starts at     
 3.30pm. There are 4 houses, Wattes,   
 Hollington, Tonyn, Dewyche taking     
 part. The gymnastics are split up into
 Troups, Duets and Solos. The school   
 team consists of 6 girls all having   
 their own routines. The Duets and     
 Solos display a theme. In the Solos   
 are Nicola from Wattes, Emma from     
 Hollington, Anna from Tonyn and Joanne
 from Dewyche acting out a theme to    
 suit the music. The school fete is    
 held every year in July and the       
 gymnastics performance is one of the  
 highlights, attracting favourable     
 comments from a large and appreciative
 audience.
