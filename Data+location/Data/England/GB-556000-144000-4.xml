		<title>04The River Medway</title>
		<content> The{River Medway}flows from Ashdown   
 Forest to its estuary in the North    
 Sea.{Tonbridge}lies in the{Vale of    
{Kent}between forest ridges and here   
 the Medway is in a flood plain. It    
 should meander but in 19th century it 
 was straightened and canalised. It was
 used by the Baltic Saw Mills for      
 transporting timber and by Thames'    
 barges carrying goods. Further        
 canalising was stopped by the railway 
 and industrial use of the river       
 declined.  The Medway has flooded     
 Tonbridge many times but the worst    
 flood was in{1968.}On{Saturday 15th   
{September}it began to rain and        
 continued for{48 hours.}By Sunday     
 night many homes were flooded, people 
 stranded upstairs or prevented from   
 returning home. The river flowed into 
 the High Street and canoes, wrenched  
 from moorings, smashed shop windows.  </content>
