{Equality at school and work:}Of the   
 people we questioned 50% said that men
 and women had equal job opportunities;
 50% felt that women were discriminated
 against.  A small proportion felt that
 girls at school were geared towards   
 studying "female subjects" eg. cookery
 as this would help them in their      
 future "female" occupations.          
{Is the woman's place in the home?}The 
 majority of people said that the      
 woman's place was not at home; however
 a small number thought that if there  
 were young children concerned a woman 
 should be at home to look after them. 
 As a result most people thought that  
 women make better "mothers" than men.
