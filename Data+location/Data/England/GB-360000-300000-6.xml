		<content> Until 1966 a railway linked Much      
 Wenlock with Wellington, Shrewsbury &amp; 
 Craven Arms. Many people remember     
 going to school &amp; shopping by train &amp; 
 it was used for milk churn collection.
  Following closure of the line under  
 the Beeching Act buses provided links 
 with surrounding settlements but were 
 withdrawn after a year for alledged   
 lack of support.Today public transport
 is very limited.An infrequent daily   
 bus  service goes to Bridgnorth &amp;     
 Shrewsbury but not Telford.           
  On Tuesday mornings a bus comes from 
 some villages in the West to Much     
 Wenlock and leaves at lunchtime.      
  A coach operator in Much Wenlock     
 provides private hire &amp; contracts, a  
 regular bingo service to Shrewsbury &amp; 
 a holiday express service in summer.  
  Another firm has day trips, foreign  
 holidays &amp; shopping in W.Midlands.    </content>
