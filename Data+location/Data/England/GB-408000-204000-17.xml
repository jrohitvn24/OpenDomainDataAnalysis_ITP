		<title>17VILLAGE SHOPS IN BIBURY</title>
		<content> There are seven shops in Bibury that  
 cater for both tourists and residents.
 They are all small and run by their   
 owners who often live 'over' the shop.
 Four depend heavily on tourists as    
 they sell meals, teas, antiques and   
 gifts. Two are open throughout the    
 year; the others close during the     
 winter months. These 'tourists' shops 
 mostly rely on part-time employees to 
 cater for the changing demand.        
 The other three shops include the two 
 general stores (the post office and   
 the paper shop) and a clothes shop.   
 These are open all year and have full 
 time staff. They are important for    
 the local people but have to compete  
 with the greater choice available in  
 Cirencester. Three mobile shops visit 
 the village each week. One sells wet  
 fish, one greengroceries and the third
 is a general store.                   </content>
