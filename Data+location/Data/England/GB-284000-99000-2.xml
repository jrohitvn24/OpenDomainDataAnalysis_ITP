		<content>   When we got our{D block}we divided  
 it into 12 squares with a,b,c and d   
 along the bottom and 1,2 and 3 up the 
 side.The first time we went out we    
 went up to Shobrook Park to interview 
 Dr. Shelley.Then when we get back we  
 write down what we found out and then 
 we copy it out onto the Domesday      
 disk.We do that with all our          
 interviews and trips .Usually we go   
 out in groups but when we visited the 
 two busiest squares, A1 and A2 we     
 went as a class.Sometimes when we go  
 out we take some pictures of the      
 area.We went out a few weeks ago to   
 stand on the corner of our{D block.}  
 Also when we get infomation we have to
 enter count data and for that you have
 to answer questions about our{D block.
  In the end all the infomation will be
 put on to video disk .
