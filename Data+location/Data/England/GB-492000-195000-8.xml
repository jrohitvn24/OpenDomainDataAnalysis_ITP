		<title>08PENN STREET CHURCH</title>
		<content>   The church was built by the first   
 Earl Howe in 1849.It has flints in the
 walls,and an usual shingled spire. Our
 school comes to services here for     
 harvest festival, Christmas, Ascencion
 Day etc. Rev: Stowe (who is also a    
 governor of our school),told us its   
 history.                              
 At the back there is a huge copy of   
 Raphael's Transfiguration which came  
 from Earl Howe's chapel in Curzon St:,
 London. It was too big to get through 
 the door, and had to come in through a
 stained glass window.                 
 A mother from our school has designed 
 the 150 tapestry kneelers, which were 
 made by the congregation. They include
 Bible fruit, festivals, flowers, local
 clubs, and the  Curzon coat-of-arms.  
 There is a model of the church made in
 matchsticks. We saw the Burial and    
 Baptism Registers.                    </content>
