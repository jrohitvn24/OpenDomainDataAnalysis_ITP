		<content> The Herefordshire/Worcestershire      
 border, east of Bromyard, is a rural  
 area with scattered population in most
 of the block, b ecoming more          
 concentrated in the east around       
 Suckley Green.  The only village store
 is a small one in Spuare 8, and there 
 is a post office in Square 2, on      
 Bringsty common.  However, the area is
 not far from the small town of        
 Bromyard,which has adequate shopping  
 facilities.  The north west of the    
 block is on Bringsty Common, which is 
 a popular picnic area in summer,and   
 has several football pitches.  In the 
 north of squares 1 &amp; 2 is Brockhampton
 Park, a National Trust property, and  
 there is deciduous woodland to a      
 varying extent throughout the area.   
 The bolock is prodominantly pasture   
 land, with three quarters of the      
 squares containing some cultivation.  </content>
