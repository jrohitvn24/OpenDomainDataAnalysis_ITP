{                                      
 The{North Devon link road}was built to
 stop so much traffic going through    
 Halberton so it would be safer for old
 and young people to cross roads.When  
 we did our traffic survey in a 20     
 minute period on the link road and in 
 Halberton we found out that there were
 more vehicles going through Halberton 
 than on the Link road.This means that 
 the link road is not in full action or
 it might not work as the council      
 planned .                             
 Most of the local people agree with   
 the link road and most of them said   
 there was more air pollution before   
 the link road was open in 1984.

 The{M5 Motorway}is heavily used by    
 holidaymakers from London,South Wales </content>
