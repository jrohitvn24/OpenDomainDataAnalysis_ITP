		<title>08WITTON PARK - SOCIAL HISTORY</title>
		<content> In 1816 Witton park did not exist     
 except a few houses in California     
 Woodside. Then two men, Bolchow and   
 Vaughan, built four blastfurnaces near
 George Pit.  This was the beginning of
 the village and many new houses were  
 built.  These were small, one-up and  
 one-down, and often damp, sharing     
 outside ash closets and water supply. 
 In 1856 the population was 2000 and in
 1897, 4500 with 14 public houses, 27  
 shops and 10 places of worship.       
    In 1882 the ironworks closed down, 
 many people moved to Middlesborough   
 and Depression followed.  With the 2nd
 World War and the closing of pits many
 houses became derelict and were pulled
 down. In 1951 it was classed as Cat. D
 where there could be no further       
 development.  By 1980 the population  
 was 505. Cat. D was lifted, houses    
 modernised and it is again developing.</content>
