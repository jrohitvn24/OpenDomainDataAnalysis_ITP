		<content> Walkern &amp; Ardeley each have a primary 
 school. Walkern is a county primary   
 school with about 66 pupils and 3     
 full-time and 1 part-time teachers.   
 Most pupils go on to the Stevenage    
 comprehensive system. The school in   
 Ardeley is a voluntary-aided parish   
 school, now just 150 years old, with  
 many old pupils still in the area. It 
 currently has 40 pupils, with about   
 10% coming from outside the immediate 
 area. Most go on to the 3-tier        
 Buntingford school system but a few go
 into the private sector. Extramural   
 activities include a brownie &amp; a cub  
 pack &amp; football but because of limited
 public transport, children rely       
 largely on parents for activities     
 outside the area. The schools both    
 form a major part of the village life.
 Future change seem unlikely, though   
 Ardeley remains the more vulnerable.  </content>
