		<title>02Family Life South of Oakley</title>
		<content> Most{families}in our area have three  
 children and a Mum and Dad. Nearly as 
 many have two children. Most people   
 live in a{detached house}with three or
 four bedrooms. It's fashionable to add
 double glazed windows, central heating
 , extra bathrooms, fitted kitchens and
 home extensions. Often both mum and   
 dad have a{car}and our houses have    
 double garages. Most of the{dads work}
 in Basingstoke, usually travelling to 
 work by car. A few dads work in       
 London, Reading, Andover, Tadley or   
 Oakley. Many{mums work}either full    
 time or part time, most of them in    
 Basingstoke or Oakley. Nearly every   
 home has a television and a telephone.
 Many have a video recorder and a home 
 computer. It is quite usual for a     
 family to have a cat or dog as a pet. 
 Often people live in{Oakley}because {}
{Basingstoke}is too large and crowded. </content>
