		<content> The United Reform Church in Kiln Lane 
 is around 13 years old. The church is 
 made of brick and sand stone. It has  
 got a cross on the church that was    
 made before the church was built the  
 cross was put on because the church it
 was on had been knocked down because  
 it was falling down. The cemetary has 
 three Chapels but only one is now     
 used. Two old churches, made of       
 sandstone, are St. Thomas of          
 Canturbury in Denton's Green and      
 St.Davids in Moss Bank. New churches  
 are St.Andrews, St.Patrick's and      
 St.Julies.
