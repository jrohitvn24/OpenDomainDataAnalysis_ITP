 Our area is on the borders of three   
boroughs Bromley, Greenwich and        
Lewisham and two counties London and   
Kent. In the past it was a series of   
villages interspersed with farmland but
now it is all part of London's         
sprawling suburbia,  although local    
people still refer to  both Mottingham 
and Chislehurst as villages.           
  The area is served by four railway   
stations and is crossed by the A20.    
  A large proportion of the adult      
population commute to London daily.
