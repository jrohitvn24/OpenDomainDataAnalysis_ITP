		<content> Condicote Lane, also known as the     
 Roman Road Ryknild Street, runs NW to 
 SE in a direct line from Condicote to 
 the Slaughters.                       
 At Nosehill Farm which is at Huntsmans
 Quarry we were told that the road     
 there had been used by drovers taking 
 cattle from Wales to London markets.  
 Beside this road is a stone trough    
 reputed to be Roman where the cattle  
 were watered.                         
 At Kineton Hill there ia a good firm  
 track which used to run directly to   
 Stow and went away NW to join an old  
 saltway towards Belas Knap long barrow
 and Sudeley Castle both at Winchcombe,
 once a Saxon capital.
