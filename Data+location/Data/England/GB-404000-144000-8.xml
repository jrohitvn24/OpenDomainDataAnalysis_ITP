		<title>08THE SALISBURY PLAIN BUSTARDS</title>
		<content> In the early 1850's the Great Bustard 
 became extinct in Great Britain, and  
 in the 1970's steps were taken to re- 
 introduce them around the Salisbury   
 Plain area where they used to breed.  
 So the Bustard Trust was formed.      
 The birds which are one of the most   
 difficult species to breed in         
 captivity, because they have no preen 
 gland - which means that if they ever 
 become water-logged could not fly -   
 hence they were easy game for the     
 hunters because of their tasty flesh. 
 Since then a certain amount of success
 has been achieved, and a number of    
 young Bustards have been reared.      
 So after many years of patience and   
 hard work by the trust, Great Bustards
 have been re-introduced in one part of
 Wiltshire and are soon to be          
 re-introduced to this area of         
 Salisbury Plain.                      </content>
