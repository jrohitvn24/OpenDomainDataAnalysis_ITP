		<title>18Hayes Hill and HolyfieldHall</title>
		<content>We visited these farms on 24th June    
1985.They are on the east of the Lea   
Valley Park.Hayes Hill farm is like a  
model farm.It contains many different  
breeds of pigs,goats,sheep,cows,horses,
poultry,rabbits and a fox.We were able 
to touch lots of these animals as they 
were quite tame.                       
Holyfieldhall Farm is a working mixed  
farm.It grows wheat for baking,barley  
for brewing,duram wheat for pasta and  
ley grass for silage.The silage is fed 
to the 150 Friesian dairy cows in the  
winter.In the summer they graze on     
rough pasture.Their milk is sold to    
United Dairies.If the farmer produces  
more milk than his quota he is fined   
17p a litre.The farm machinery included
a combine harvester,manure spreader and
tractors.
