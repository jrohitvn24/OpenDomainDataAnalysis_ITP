  Our area is basicly a bad            
 Agricultural area but quite good for  
 coal mining, but the mining could     
 cease in a few years time. The land is
 mainly fields with few amenities. It  
 has streams and burns , such as Haydon
 Letch and Potland Burn, there is also 
 some woodland scattered round about   
 the area. On estimate 70% of the land 
 is rough pasture, 20% farmland and 10%
 mining and Government property. The   
 mine is a major industrial component  
 in the area. When opened it employed  
 4500 men but now only 600 men work    
 there. In 1849 when the first shaft   
 was sunk it was a great industrial    
 boom for the area but now the changes 
 in demand for coal could be the end of
 the great mining industry in Ashington
