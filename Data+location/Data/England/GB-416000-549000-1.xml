		<title>01INTRODUCTION TO THE AREA</title>
		<content> South Moor is an old mining village.To
 the South is the small community of   
 Quaking Houses, named after an old    
 Quaker meeting house.The majority of  
 the housing was built prior to W.W.1  
 but many new Council houses have been 
 added since.Community facilities are  
 limited but there is a Sports Centre  
 and modern shopping in nearby Stanley.
 Annfield Plain has the same mining    
 traditions,but stands on the main     
 Consett_Sunderland road and is        
 therefore more accessible.Many new    
 projects are in progress,including a  
 new By_Pass,funded by the E.E.C.a     
 large Medical Centre and an Old       
 People's Living Complex.              
 Whilst the area is run down           
 industrially this has been no         
 deterrent to the thriving community   
 spirit.
