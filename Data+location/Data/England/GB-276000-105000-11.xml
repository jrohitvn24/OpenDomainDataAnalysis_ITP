		<title>11Ecology of Morchard Bishop</title>
		<content> This is an area patterned with small  
 fields surrounded by hedge banks,     
 streams with trees along them and     
 pockets of woodland.Small birds,both  
 resident and migrant are plentiful.   
 Rooks abound with a rookery at Venn.  
 There are many magpies and crows.This 
 year saw few swallows and housemartins
 and the cuckoo was hardly heard.Canada
 geese and buzzards nest in the old    
 quarry,our only truly 'wild place'.   
 Winter visitors are plovers,starlings,
 and fieldfares.Pheasants,partridges,  
 hares and little owls exist in small  
 numbers.Badgers and foxes are         
 plentiful and rabbits back again in   
 number.Both fallow and red deer are   
 occasionaly seen.Butterflies are rare.
 1985 started exceptionaly cold and dry
 and in late July turned cold and      
 wet.Part of the village in now a      
 conservation area.                    </content>
