		<content> In the old hall there was a stage. Now
 it has gone. They had prayers every   
 day which were in the old hall and the
 Head Girl, Evelyn Mace, sat on the    
 balcony. At break, Grandma said, they 
 could buy milk and biscuits in the    
 cookery room, which was in Room 12.   
 Grandma was one of about 200 pupils   
 who went to the school. Now there are 
 roughly 950 girls. Grandma's uiniform 
 was a blue tie, white blouse, gym     
 slip (which was knee length), black   
 shoes and stockings and a navy blue   
 blazer, and cap with the school badge 
 on it.                                
 The tall building next door was the   
 boarding house.                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
