		<title>16Lundy's only child.</title>
		<content> Brent is the only child who now lives 
 on the island.He is 4 years old.      
 He enjoys watching television and     
 playing with his toy tractor.His      
 favourite place on the island is the  
 South Light and he treasures a ship in
 a bottle made for him by George who is
 one of the lighthouse keepers.        
 Brent is taught at home.There are     
 advantages and disadvantages to being 
 taught on his own.As there are no     
 other children he can work quicker but
 he misses out on the activities and   
 facilities of a school.               
 He goes to the mainland to get toys   
 and he has been twice in the last 6   
 months.                               
 Brent is not allowed to go off on his 
 own,the farthest he has been with his 
 mum is Tibbett's Lookout.
