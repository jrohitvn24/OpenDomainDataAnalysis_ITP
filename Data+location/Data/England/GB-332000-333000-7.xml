		<title>07NON-FARMING RESIDENCES</title>
		<content> The{houses}we visited and the people  
 that lived there had nothing to do    
 with the many nearby farms.The people 
 we found spent little time in their   
 own homes as they had{jobs in nearby  
{towns.}The first house we came to     
 belonged to a Mr Chaffy,who worked as 
 a teacher in Oswestry and had lived in
 this area for 4 years,having          
 previously lived in Birmingham.His    
 house was a{renovated farm cottage    
 that was falling apart and he also has
 a small holding of 3 fields that are  
 roughly 4 acres in size.Also present  
 in this small community are some      
 doctors from Overton.                 
    In another house we visited there  
 lived a{retired Major}from the army   
 and he has lived here for 12 years.He 
 enjoys gardening and keeps bees, he   
 keeps most of the honey for himself   
 but he does sell some.                </content>
