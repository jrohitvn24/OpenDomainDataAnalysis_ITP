		<content> Most farms in the area have a flock of
 breeding ewes either to graze the     
 upland areas of their farms or to     
 improve the quality of the grassland. 
 The fat lambs and fleeces provide a   
 subsidiary income.   One of the       
 biggest farms has a unit for rearing  
 bull beef.   These animals are housed 
 on a slatted floor and fed            
 concentrates.   150 are reared every  
 two years.   A few breeding sows are  
 kept and the piglets sold either as   
 weaners or fattened.   The smaller    
 farms tend to have this mixed economy.
                                       
 A large amount of silage is made for  
 winter feed; some hay is made for     
 feeding to young stock and is also    
 bought from the South Lancashire plain
 area.   Average milk production from  
 Black Moss Farm: 7200 litres per cow  
 per lactation; 5700 litres per heifer.</content>
