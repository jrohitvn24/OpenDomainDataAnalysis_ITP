		<title>18Religion in Great Coxwell</title>
		<content> Religion is represented in Gt.Coxwell 
 by St.Giles Church,a 12th century     
 building,which is part of the estab-  
 lished Church of England.Approximately
 8% of the inhabitants worship regular-
 ly &amp; the vicar also officiates at 3   
 other churches.There have been nine   
 weddings,eight baptisms &amp; five        
 funerals during the last five years.  
 Restoration and redecoration were     
 carried out during the beginning of   
 this decade.From 1875 there was a     
 Methodist Chapel by Chapel House,it   
 was demolished in 1953.With the close 
 of the Chapel many of its regular     
 worshippers then attended St.Giles.   
 During the middle years of this       
 century there were a few residents who
 were staunch Jehovah's Witnesses,but  
 they moved away in the 1970's.
