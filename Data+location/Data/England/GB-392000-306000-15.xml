		<title>15SCHOOL AND VILLAGE LIFE</title>
		<content>The school is closely linked with the  
church and is the centre for most      
social activites in the village.The    
calendar of religious and social events
are well attended by both parents and  
villagers.The school holds three       
services in church each year,a Harvest 
Festival in October,a service on Ash   
Wednesday and a third on Ascension Day.
At all of these the pupils play a major
role in the singing of hymns and in the
reading of prayers and poems.The       
Christmas concert and carol service are
much enjoyed,when the school invites   
the senior citizens to the dress       
rehearsal.The final event of the school
year is Sports Day,which is always     
popular with the children,as are the   
swimming lessons in the heated outdoor 
pool.This is also used by other nearby 
schools.
