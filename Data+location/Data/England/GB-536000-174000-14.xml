		<title>14 Law and Order-Blackheath</title>
		<content>The Blackheath Village homebeat police 
officer has to patrol 6 square miles.He
visits the village daily.The times of  
these visits vary in order to make the 
would-be criminal feel uneasy.The      
police officer advises the villagers to
protect their homes by locking all     
doors,securing windows &amp; forming neigh-
bourhood watch schemes.The officer     
checks the security arrangements with  
the shopkeepers &amp; records the details  
of their keyholders every 9 months.    
  The worst crime committed in Black-  
heath in 1985 was the hammering to     
death of a man in Lee Terrace.The most 
common crimes are shoplifting,car      
theft and vandalism.Children have      
become more involved in crime in the   
last ten years. Blackheath is not      
difficult to police.
