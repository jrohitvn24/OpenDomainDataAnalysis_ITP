		<content> This area lies in the centre of the   
 Isle of Wight. It has low rounded     
 hills, small woods and hidden valleys.
 The Medina stream flows south to north
 The Downs flank the area to the west  
 and north-east. Some of the soil is   
 chalky and some is sandy-loam. Many of
 the farms are small and there are     
 cattle as well as different crops     
 in the fields, including vegetables.  
{There are two small settlements.      
{Gatcombe nestles in a valley to the   
{west: Blackwater straddles the Medina 
{stream in the north-east. Only        
{the northern part of the villages of  
{Chillerton and Rookley fall in the    
{area.}The two main routes run north-  
 south and there are many small lanes  
 with hedgerows and steep flowered     
 banks. Several of the Island Long     
 Distance Trails pass through this     
 lovely countryside.                   </content>
