		<title>11TRAFFIC ON THE A38 RIPLEY</title>
		<content> We went to the A38 through farmland.  
 There was a tunnel which went under   
 the A38 for the farmer.We sat on a    
 grassy bank.We went in the time of    
 1.55 to 2.05.We had 10 minutes.Some of
 us counted cars,some motorbikes,some  
 lorries.You had to put a line down    
 every time one went past.We saw lots  
 of cars ,lorries and vans.We heard    
 lots of traffic and a bird.I think    
 they did the right thing to build the 
 By-pass,because it keeps the heavy    
 traffic out of town.We counted:-      
 107 cars       94 lorries      15 vans
 2 police cars  10 recovery trucks.    
    I think the A38 is a bother to the 
 countryside,because it pollutes the   
 air.It destroys the scenery.The fields
 are peaceful and beautiful places,but 
 with a motorway in the middle,they are
 all noise and bad air.
