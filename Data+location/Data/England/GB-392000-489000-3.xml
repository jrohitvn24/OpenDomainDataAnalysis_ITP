		<content> The climate in this part of the world 
 plays a very important part in the    
 life of the community and the main    
 industry of the area, hill farming.   
 Being at the summit of the Northern   
 Pennines, and the Dale being exposed  
 to the prevailing South Westerly      
 winds, the average annual rainfall is 
 one of the highest in the country.    
 This is an aid to the main crop       
 production, namely grass.             
 The hill formation causes very        
 localised weather patterns.           
 During most winters, the Dales are    
 subject to a moderate snowfall,       
 but they seldom suffer the extremes   
 experienced in other parts of the     
 Pennines.                             
 After a sudden thaw or heavy rain,    
 the low meadows and valley roads are  
 often flooded.                        
                                       </content>
