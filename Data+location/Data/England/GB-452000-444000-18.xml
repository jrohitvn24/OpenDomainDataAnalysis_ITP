		<content> 32 years ago in Bilbrough School there
 were 34 pupils, 2 full time teachers, 
 and a cleaner,who doubled as a maid/  
 dining assistant.Approx. 26 children  
 stayed school dinner,which was brought
 in cans from Bishopthorpe.Free school 
 milk and cod liver oil capsules were  
 provided.In 1985 there are 30 pupils, 
 2 full time teachers,and the part_time
 assistance of a third teacher,a cook, 
 a dining assistant,a clerk and a      
 cleaner.12 children stay school dinner
 regularly,15 bring packed lunches and 
 3 go home.About 20 meals are prepared 
 for Askham Richard School.            
 In 1953 there were outside toilets    
 (earth closets) in the playground. The
 heating was by coke stoves.These were 
 lit by the cleaner and stoked by the  
 teachers.Fuel was in short supply.Now 
 there is indoor sanitation,hot water, 
 a playing field and electrical heating</content>
