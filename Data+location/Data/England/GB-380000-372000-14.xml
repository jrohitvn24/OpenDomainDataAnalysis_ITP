		<content>{Chelford}has no outstanding buildings,
 architecturally. There are a number of
 old buildings, e.g. Abbey Farm,the old
 Vicarage,The Manor House, etc. None of
 them are open to the Public. The Manor
 House is the most interesting,having  
 begun life as a cruck cottage(?14th   
 Cent.) being added to every century   
 since. The church is of a simple      
 design as is the 1892 school. The     
 largest building in the block is a    
 large,ugly, brick-built government    
 food store by the railway (south of   
 the station). The railway station is  
 being rebuilt in brick. The present   
 village is mainly Victorian, the newer
 housing being just to the north of the
 boundary of this block. There is but  
 one Public House(The Dixon Arms) in   
 the block,the two in the original     
 village being long closed down.       
 Withington Hall is largely unseen.    </content>
