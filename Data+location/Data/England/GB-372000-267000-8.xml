		<title>08CHURCH HISTORY.</title>
		<content> The church was re-opened in 1877.The  
 Lychgate was erected in 1887 also a   
 quarter chiming clock in the church   
 tower.                                
{THE OLD BELL.}                        
 This bell can be seen on the floor in 
 the chancel of St. Michael's          
 church.This ancient bell was saved    
 when the other four bells were sold in
 1850 to partly pay for the new chime  
 in the new church.It was thought by   
 the rector of the time &lt;Rev.Severne>  
 to have been given to the parish by   
 the Rev.Blamyre who lived in Henry    
 V111's time.Rev.Blamyre became Rector 
 of Abberley in 1514.He brought the    
 bell with him, probably from          
 Cumberland.The bell when it hung in   
 the old tower was cracked&lt;probably    
 by careless ringing in 1874>.The crack
 was so wide and long it couldn't be   
 repaired,so it was taken down.        </content>
