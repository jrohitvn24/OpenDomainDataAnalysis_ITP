		<content>      This survey was begun by twenty  
 children in class 3 of Marden Primary 
 School. The idea was to generate a    
 picture of our block by beginning with
 the nucleus of the village of Marden  
 and then to fan outwards to include a 
 number of features characteristic of  
 this area, at present. Maps were      
 duplicated, material perused and log  
 books prepared for our own individual 
 records of our researches and         
 activities. Unfortunately we          
 mis-judged the depth and content of   
 the programme. We also mis-judged the 
 disruptive affect of the normal school
 life to which we were committed. A    
 week in France and the attendant      
 preparations, Galas, Fetes, Sports    
 Days, a week's music festival, an end 
 of term concert and the departure of  
 older children, ground us to a halt.
