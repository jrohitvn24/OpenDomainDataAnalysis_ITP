		<content> I get up for for school at about 7.30 
 and have my breakfast and wash. I     
 leave for school around 8.15 to arrive
 at 8.30. The firt bell goes at 8.50   
 and that's for registration. Then     
 there may be an assembly if it is     
 Thursday.Then it is first lesson. Next
 bell for break is then heard at 10.25 
 followed by 20 minutes break, and into
 2nd period. This ends at 11.50 and    
 then it is lunch time.At the moment I 
 go home for dinner because of the     
 teachers' dispute. The next bell is   
 for afternoon registration and then   
 into the 3rd period, which lasts for  
 1hr. 10 minutes.The last period starts
 at 2.20pm and lasts to 3.30pm and then
 we can go home.                       
  In the Littlehampton we have many    
 subjects, eg. English, Maths, P.E.,   
 French and German.
