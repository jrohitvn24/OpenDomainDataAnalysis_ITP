		<title>17Cammas Hall Farm Visit 2</title>
		<content> The house is an early 15th Century    
 Tudor house and we all noticed the    
 massive Tudor chimnies. The farm is   
 partly "Pick your own". Most of the   
 fields have names like "Aunt's Garden"
 , "10 Acres", "Good Sheepfield","Short
 Alley" and "Long Alley". The farm has 
 412 acres, the average field size is  
 25 acres. Wheat is the main crop,but  
 barley,oil seed rape, rhubarb,        
 rasberries, strawberries, loganberries
 , gooseberries and are also grown. We 
 were shown the old barn called the    
 Tithe Barn. This is about the same age
 as the house. There is an old moat    
 around the house, it has some ducks on
 it now. There is also a lilly pond    
 containing  many goldfish. Kingfishers
 have been seen near the pond but we   
 weren't lucky enough to see them on   
 our visit.
