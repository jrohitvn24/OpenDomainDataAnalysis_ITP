 Thanks are due to the many nameless   
 people who assisted us on our travels 
 especially the gentlemen of Helme     
 Park.To the Tempest family for their  
 help with the farming in the area and 
 the Fir Tree W.I. for their           
 information about Fir Tree.The two    
 farmers who gave up part of their time
 to talk about their own farms whilst  
 baling or turning the hay deserve a   
 mention as does Miss A.Harrison of    
 Hartside School for her information.My
 special thanks to certain members     
 of the staff of Crook C.J.M. School   
 for the time,patience and guidance but
 a special thanks to the children of   
 Class 8 1984/5 whose willingness to   
 work out of school made much of this  
 possible.                             
                Thankyou, M.Urwin.
