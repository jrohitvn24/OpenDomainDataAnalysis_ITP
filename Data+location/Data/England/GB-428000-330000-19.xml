		<content> During the{1939-1945 War}an{aerodrome 
 was established at{Burnaston,}Map ref 
 29o/307,mainly to train pilots,using  
 the Tiger Moth plane. After the war it
 continued as a training ground for a  
 private flying club.                  
 In the 1950's it quickly developed as 
 a commercial airport, known as{Derby  
{Airport.}Regular holiday flights to   
 the{Channel Islands and Glasgow}were  
 operated using Dakota aeroplanes. The 
 runways were grass and lit by oil     
 flares with no major disasters        
 occuring. The nearby Burnaston        
 House,now mostly derelect, was used as
 a restaurant and bar for piolts and   
 customers.                            
 Although small the complex housed     
 offices and customs facilities. As    
 wages improved and holiday traffic    
 increased it became necessary to      
 expand.                               </content>
