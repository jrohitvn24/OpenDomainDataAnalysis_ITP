		<title>13A DAY IN MY LIFE - MORNING</title>
		<content>   During the{school}week I get up at  
 7 o'clock and get washed and dressed, 
 arriving dowstairs just in time to    
 watch{Popeye the Sailorman}on         
{television}as I have my{breakfast}of  
{cornflakes, milk}and{toast.}          
  My mum gives me my{packed lunch      
 of{sandwiches, yohurt, biscuit}and    
 an{apple.}I check my bag to make sure 
 I've got everything I need for school.
 On the way to school I usually call at
 the shop to buy some{sweets}and       
{crisps. }When I get into the          
{playground}I play with my friends     
 until the bell goes.  Everyone lines  
 up in classes and waits to be sent in 
 by a member of staff.                 
   On the way to the{classroom}we stop 
 at the cloakroom to put our coats away
 and change our shoes ready for        
{Assembly}in the hall.
