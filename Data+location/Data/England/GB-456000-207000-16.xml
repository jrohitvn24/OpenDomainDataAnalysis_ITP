		<content>The vicar at Forest Hill church is also
the vicar at Stanton St John and       
Wheatley. In the graveyard at the      
church the headstones are at the side. 
This happens when all the family has   
died off.  This is done to make it easy
to look after.  This graveyard is      
around the church but sometimes it is  
away from the church.  The churchyard  
is now full and 2 other sites are used.
The main part of the church is Norman  
and years later parts were added.  The 
roof needs repairing because of weather
damage.  The cost will be about 30 to  
40,000 pounds.  There are 2 bells.  The
font is quite recent as the other one  
was stolen.  20 to 25 people go to     
church on Sundays.  In 1984 there were 
11 baptisms, 1 confirmation, 6 weddings
and 5 funerals.
