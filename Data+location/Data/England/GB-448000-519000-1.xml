		<title>01THE AREA OF OUR STUDY</title>
		<content>                                       
    The area we have been given to     
 study extends from Newport in the West
 to North Ormesby in the East, and from
 Linthorpe in the South to Port        
 Clarence in the North.                
    The river Tees runs through our    
 area from East to West and causes the 
 land to be divided into two main      
 parts. The Northern half of the area  
 on either side of the river is used by
 industries, many of which need to be  
 by the river, and the Southern half of
 the map has many houses, together with
 shops and parks that the people living
 there need.                           
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
