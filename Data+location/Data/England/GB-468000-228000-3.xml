		<title>03THE VILLAGE OF HILLESDEN</title>
		<content> The most turbulent period in the      
 history of the village was during the 
 Civil War. Hillesden House was the    
 home of the Royalist Dentons and was  
 demolished by Cromwell's men. Until   
 1860 most of Hillesden belonged to the
 Dukes of Buckingham. In 1901 the land,
 with the exception of 3 farms, was    
 purchased by Christ Church College,   
 Oxford. In the recent past the land   
 has been further divided, the majority
 in the hands of a business concern and
 two farms in private hands. A modern  
 Hillesden House has been built close  
 to the original site, incorporating   
 within its bounds the remains of the  
 moat which now serves as a swimming   
 pool. There has been little new       
 building in recent years but some     
 renovation of older buildings has     
 taken place. However these are mainly 
 used as second homes or holiday houses</content>
