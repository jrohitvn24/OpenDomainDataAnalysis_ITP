		<content> Wildlife is limited to hedges and     
 woodland, as all the land in our area 
 is farmland. There ar many rabbits,   
 hares, a few badgers, grey squirrals  
 and foxes. Common birds include       
 magpies, rooks, pied wagtails,        
 swallows and chaffinches.             
 As the villages are small, there are  
 few amenities: there is one shop, one 
 pub, two garages, a few scattered post
 boxes and phone boxes. Thre is no     
 state school, so children have to go  
 to Stone or Stafford. The only bus    
 routes are on the A34 and A5013.      
 People living in the area thus make   
 their own entertainment in their      
 homes, gardens or in the surrounding  
 countryside,watching television,
