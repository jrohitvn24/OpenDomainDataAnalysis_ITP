		<title>03Hesketh Golf Course</title>
		<content> In 1885 Hesketh Golf Course was built 
 on sand dunes so it was a golf links. 
 The modern club house was built in    
 1903. There are about 450 members in  
 the Golf Club. The playing times are  
 8.30 on normal days but on competition
 days it opens at 7.30 and it closes at
 dusk. The Golf Course used to be a    
 place called Little Ireland where 60  
 to 80 people lived, and the           
 greenkeeper's hut was the schoolhouse.
 Colonel Hesketh bought the course so  
 nobody could build on it. In 1945     
 there was an atrocious flood on the   
 Golf Course. It was caused by the sea 
 coming over the sea wall and the water
 was about 9 feet deep.                
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
