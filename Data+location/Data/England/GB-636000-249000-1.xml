		<title>01A Review of the Butley Area.</title>
		<content> utley is a very rural place with a    
small population. All the land is less 
than one hundred feet obove sea level  
and was therefore prone to flooding.   
Much sea defence work has been done to 
prevent this.                          
The main road is the B1084 which runs  
from Woodbridge to Orford. There are   
also minor roads leading to Tunstall,  
Hollesley and Bentwaters Air Base, a   
large American Air Force establishment 
which has a great effect on this rural 
area.                                  
The small stream known as Butley River 
is fresh water, but becomes tidal, with
reed beds or saltmarshes either side of
the river.                             
Sir Edward Greenwell owns most of the  
farms and the fields around Butley.    
Neighbouring villages, Chillesford,    
Capel and Wantisden are also small.
