 for thirty two years. Since his early 
 years he has been interested in       
 horses. After leaving school he became
 a banker. He fought in the Second     
 World War. After the war he purchased 
 the famous stables at Beckhampton.    
   At present he has sixty horses in   
 training and these can be seen every  
 morning galloping across the downs    
 near the stables or racing around the 
 training course. Mr Tree has five     
 trainers working for him and twenty   
 five jockeys or stable lads. Each     
 jockey rides two or three horses a
