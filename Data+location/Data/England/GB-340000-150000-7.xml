		<title>07The Donkey Derby</title>
		<content>  On Saturday 6th or July we had a     
 Donkey Derby at Weare school.We  hired
 some racing donkeys.They  came in a   
 lorry which stopped in our field.At 2 
 p.m. the Donkey Derby opened.The races
 started  at 2:30 so if you came at    
 2:00  you could look around the side  
 shows.There were games like hoopla,   
 skittles,fishing and                  
 china-smashing.There were cold and hot
 drinks to be bought and doughnuts,    
 cakes,candy -floss and ice-cream to be
 eaten.Everything was different on the 
 school field.There were orange ropes  
 where the donkeys were going to run   
 and two large tents near the swimming 
 pool.In front of the tents was the    
 Tote.The Tote is a  place where you   
 can bet on the donkey you would like  
 to win.If your donkey wins you get    
 quite a lot of money.I enjoyed my day 
 at the Donkey Derby!                  </content>
