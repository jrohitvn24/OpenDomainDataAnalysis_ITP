		<title>15MY FAVOURITE T.V. PROGRAMME</title>
		<content> On television my favourite programme  
 is Cover_Up.I sometimes like other    
 programes.Sometimes I go out_side and 
 miss Cover_Up and forget that it is   
 on.When I sit down I ask if I could   
 turn the over.Dad sometimes watches   
 the news so that I cannot watch it.In 
 Cover_Up they have nice people.There  
 were these girls doing modelling.The  
 baddies are always in it.I see that   
 Max the boy model always catches them.
 I stare at the television when I am   
 intrested in the programe.I always    
 make sure that I am comfortable before
 I watch the programme.Sometimes mum   
 and dad talk while I am watching my   
 programe.Mark,Mum and dad say they    
 dont like the silly programe.The      
 television sometimes goes wrong so we 
 just sit there until it comes right.
