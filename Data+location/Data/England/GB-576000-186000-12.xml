		<title>12Architecture in Sth.Benfleet</title>
		<content> The oldest building is St.Mary's      
 Church. Examples of medieval          
 half_timbered buildings can be found  
 near the church:The Hoy and Helmet and
 the Anchor date back to the early 16th
 century and display original oak      
 beams.The Half_Crown is a 19th century
 brick building on a possible medieval 
 foundation.Before a lorry demolished  
 part of it in 1972 it was called the  
 Crown.Some half_timbered cottages and 
 houses with weather_boarding cluster  
 around the church.An upsurge in       
 building around the turn of the       
 century has left some remnants of a   
 few grand Victorian houses in Vicarage
 Hill, Benfleet Road and Thundersley Pk
 Road.In some cases new facades hide   
 the original construction.The shopping
 arcades along the High Road are mostly
 converted Victorian terrace houses    
 whose origin can still be discerned.  </content>
