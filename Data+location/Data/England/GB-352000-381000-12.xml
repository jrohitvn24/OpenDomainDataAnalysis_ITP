		<title>12THE ECOLOGY OF RUNCORN</title>
		<content>{1.Woodland.                           
{Windmill Hill Wood and Big Wood.}Both 
 these woods are within 1km of each    
 other.Big Wood,once known as Northwood
 has existed for over 300 years.At     
 present it is not open to the         
 public,however young people on a      
 government employment scheme are      
 remaking long lost footpaths and      
 laying out new ones ready for the     
 woods to become a public amenity and  
 nature reserve.Dominant amongst the   
 trees is the Sycamore with            
 approximately 500 counted.            
  A much younger wood, the one at      
 Windmill Hill is on the edge of a     
 Development Corporation housing       
 estate.It is much more open than Big  
 Wood and is used widely as an area of 
 recreation for joggers and walkers.   
 Enviromental Rangers have planted many
 young trees particularly Beech and Oak</content>
