		<title>15MORE CHANGE IN BRINSWORTH</title>
		<content>    Back in the{1940's and 1950's}much 
 of{Brinsworth}was still{farmland.}    
    The houses in{Duncan Street, Ellis 
{Street and Atlas Street}were pit-owned
 and many miners lived there. There    
 were some{private}houses built on the 
{Hall estate.                          
    Much of the farmland has been taken
 for other uses.{Shinn's farm}used to  
 extend to where the{lorry park}is now.
    There used to be a{crisp factory}in
 Brinsworth but this has been converted
 into shops.                           
    Nowadays most of the shops are{    
{self-service}and open shorter hours.  
 Up till a few years ago some used to  
 stay open as long as{twenty hours.}The
{grocers, electrical appliance store   
{and bakers}have all been modernised.  
 Prices have risen with the cost of    
 living.{Barclay's Bank}has opened a   
 branch in Brinsworth.                 </content>
