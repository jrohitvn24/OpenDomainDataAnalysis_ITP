		<title>03MOTORWAY  M1</title>
		<content> The construction of the {M1}began at  
 Aldenham in 1959 and it was the first 
 motorway to be opened in Britain,     
 except for a small section of the {M6}
 to bypass Preston.                    
 The section of the M1 in our rectangle
 stretches right through our three     
 western squares.  Junction No 5 split{
{Berry Grove Wood}in half and the      
 northward route had to cross {The     
{River Colne}by the first M1 bridge to 
 be built.  Junction 5 allowed {A41}   
 users to enter the Motorway.   Its    
 route then cut off the eastern side of
{Munden House's}land.                  
 After crossing the Watford to St      
 Albans railway the Motorway leaves our
 rectangle through {Bricket Wood.}The  
 Motorway at Aldenham was originally   
 only four lane, but in 1982/83 this   
 was increased to six lanes.
