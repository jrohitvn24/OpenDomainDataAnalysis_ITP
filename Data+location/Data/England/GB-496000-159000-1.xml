		<content>     {A WORD PICTURE OF THE AREA}      
 Our 4x3 grid consists of an area which
 includes large  sections of two of    
{Woking's} old outlying villages,      
{Horsell and Chobham};and a smaller    
 part of two other villages{Bisley}and 
{Knaphill.} These four are separated   
 by a wedge of green land along the    
 banks of the River Bourne,a tributary 
 of the River Wey.                     
   The two former villages are old ones
 with a conservation area at the       
 centre of each.They were probably     
 built originally with locally made    
 brick  and the roads with flint and   
 sand dug from the adjacent commons.   
   To the South East corner of the area
  we have part of a large new          
 development called{Goldsworth Park.   
 This has been built on former nursery 
 land.                                 
                                       </content>
