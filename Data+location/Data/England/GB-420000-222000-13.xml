		<title>13THE WALK TO ICOMB</title>
		<content>   Me Wayne and Mrs. Holmes went for a 
 walk. We started at the church and    
 went on to the river. I saw two       
 mallard ducks and a cuckoo. For the   
 walk we started at Bledington and we  
 went to Icomb. We went past the       
 reservoir and came to Icomb. We lost  
 our way because a farmer had put      
 barbed wire where we was meant to go. 
 We tried to go around it but we could 
 not find the right way for a long     
 time. The fotpath was on the ordinance
 survey map. We enjoyed our walk but it
 was a bit tiring.                     
         Trevor Warne and Wayne Gorton.
