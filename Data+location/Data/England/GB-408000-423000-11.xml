		<content>  In the 19th century Halifax was      
 one of the biggest{wool and linen     
 producing towns in England.However,   
 tough competition from the East       
 produced cheap material,making British
 wool look relatively expensive.So,    
 when the imported material started    
 being used,the British woollen        
 industry began to rapidly decline.    
                                       
{  The Cragg Coiners,}forgers of gold  
 coins, were a gang of men who set up  
 at Bell House with their melting      
 pots,branding irons and equipment     
 necessary for this crime.They clipped 
 the gold coins and melted them,making 
 perfect forgeries.
