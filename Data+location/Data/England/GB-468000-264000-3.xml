  The majority of houses belongs to the
Spencer estate,although some have been 
sold and at least one rented by a firm 
based in Northampton.There are a couple
of derelict houses.                    
                                       
  Most buildings are constructed of    
local sandstone and several are        
thatched.(The village thatcher is now  
retired).Some houses are of            
considerable age.One in Harlestone has 
a sundial on its outside wall.         
                                       
  The most unusual style of house is   
the row of wooden cottages(Swedish     
Houses) in Harlestone built as council 
housing in 1951.                       
                                       
  There are two sets of railway        
cottages built to house"fog men" who   
worked on the nearby railway.          </content>
