		<title>14WORKING MENS CLUB W. RAINTON</title>
		<content> W. Rainton W.M. Club was formed in    
 1890. It joined the{national union}of 
 clubs in{1906.}Fees are paid to this  
 organisation based on its membership. 
 These help to provide rest homes for  
 the sick to recuperate. It is         
 completely self-sufficient and has    
 about 750 members: 600 men and about  
 150 women. Membership has dropped     
 recently because unemployment has     
 meant people cannot afford the        
 membership fees. The club is run by a 
{ten-man committee}which also organises
 entertainment.
