		<title>11BERRY HILL SCHOOL LIFE.</title>
		<content> At school we use  a pen and pencil and
 our school teaches 9 to 13 year old   
 children. The First Year  spends more 
 time on Integrated Studies than any   
 other lesson.At school we use         
 computers,tape recorders,televisions  
 and a video.                          
 Most pupils would prefer to wear what 
 they want rather than the school      
 uniform.Girls think we need to write  
 with biros and boys ink pens.At school
 lots of teachers get fed up of their  
 classes occasionally.                 
 More people walk to school than go by 
 other forms of transport.The caretaker
 looks after the school with the help  
 of cleaners.The school was built in   
 1967 and is built of concrete,brick   
 and wood.
