		<content> The area is dominated by agriculture  
 because of high quality Grade 1 red   
 soil, producing mainly corn and arable
 crops. Beef, sheep and some dairy     
 animals graze the less accessible     
 fields for tractors. Another dominant 
 feature are numerous electricity      
 pylons providing energy for outlying  
 homestad. Most homes had at least one 
 car parked, outside, in the drive or  
 in a personal garage.  Many houses,   
 previously homes of farm workers had  
 eiter been sold and renovated, or let 
 to individuals, families connected    
 with wide range of service industries 
 not just farming. Very few homes built
 in last 30yrs those that have, mainly 
 luxury bungalows, houses. Evidence of 
 many homes being renovated. Few       
 services, food paprs post milk etc    
 all delivered by cars, vans, if at    
 all.                                  </content>
