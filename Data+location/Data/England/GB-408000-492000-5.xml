		<content>{FERN COTTAGE__}This is an eighteenth  
 century house containing fragments of 
 one much older and showing to         
 perfection the flat stone arches which
 are so much a feature of the          
 vernacular tradition here.            
{THE OLD BROOK HOUSE__}It was built 250
 years ago (1732). It was first a pub  
 called the Farmers Arms. Then a violin
 maker took the house. Next a miller   
 took it, on the third floor he kept   
 flour and corn. That was 80 years ago.
 It was split into two houses. Mr.     
 Broadley who was a butcher moved in   
 next. After he died the council took  
 it. The council were going to pull it 
 down but they didn't. In 1960 the     
 present owners bought the house. When 
 they first moved in there was no      
 garden only a field.
