		<content>      On 18th. April, 1985 the Dukeries
 Complex   was officially opened.      
 Previously the Dukeries Comprehensive 
 School, the Complex is a powerful     
{community resource}designed to help   
 young and old, unemployed, handicapped
 and essentially the whole family.     
      The opportunity to develop the   
 Complex arose from falling roles at   
 the Dukeries School  (from nearly     
 2,000 places to an anticipted 900 by  
 1990).                                
      The central unit is the{Community
{College}(previously the school).      
 Additionally, there is the Recreation 
 Centre,Under 5's Centre, Community    
 Library,Youth Centre, Information     
 Centre,Agency Base and mini-Town Hall,
 Day Centre for Senior Citizens,

 Education Centre for the Mentally     
 Handicapped.                          </content>
