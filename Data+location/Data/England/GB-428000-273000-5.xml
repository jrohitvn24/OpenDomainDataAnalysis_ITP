		<title>05PLAYING IN CRACKLEY WOODS</title>
		<content>Crackley Wood is a great place to play 
in. You can imagine yourself lost in an
alien world, or being an outlaw, or    
being attacked by wild beasts. There   
are many enormous trees to climb, the  
best ones being the biggest because you
get an  excellent view of everything   
around you including the farms. There  
is a squash and tennis club next to the
woods. The dissused railway is great   
fun for ambushing people on because    
there are well hidden slopes on either 
side making it almost impossible to be 
spotted. The woods are a safe place,   
because it hasn't got a reputation for 
child abductors or malestors.  I think 
it is a superb place to play in.
