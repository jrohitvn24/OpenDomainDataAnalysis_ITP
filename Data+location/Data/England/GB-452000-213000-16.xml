		<content>Most of the older houses in the area   
would be built of limestone quarried   
locally.There was a quarry in Islip off
Mill Street,where there is now a       
private house called The Grange.Many of
these houses were once farm or other   
labourers' cottages bought up after the
'39-'45 war and greatly improved by    
their new and more affluent owners     
about the time when many new houses    
including Council Houses were          
built.Each village therefore contains a
good selection of new and old houses   
all of which have made very comfortable
homes.Most are                         
served by mains electricity,water and  
sewerage,and contain an electric       
cooker,refrigerator,freezer,and        
washing machine,plus                   
television,probably a video and the    
usual domestic cleaning                
appliances.There are no mansions.      </content>
