		<content> In 1983 Taunton's first new shopping  
 precinct, the Old Market Centre was   
 built.                                
  In 1985 after a delay of more than 10
 years another large shopping centre   
 was started in the Billet St. area at 
 a cost of Â£11m. The site is owned by  
 the Sun Life Assurance Co. Stores are 
 being built for Sainsburys(45,000     
 sq.ft.), C &amp; A(11,000 sq.ft.), House  
 of Holland(4,000 sq.ft.), a drugstore 
 and 12 other smaller shops.           
  It is estimated that will create     
 about 300 new jobs.There will be car  
 parking in the centre for 330 cars    
 Already people shop in Taunton from a 
 wide area and survays show that they  
 come from as far as Bristol and       
 Exeter.The new shopping centre will   
 bring even more people in and will    
 become a tourist attraction.
