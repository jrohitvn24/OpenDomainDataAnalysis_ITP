		<content>There is one area in Hinderclay which  
is relatively more densly populated and
to a lesser extent one area in         
Thelnetham. The rest of the housing is 
in small clusters of houses &amp; isolated 
individual houses. Most houses have    
quite large gardens, and many have a   
meadow or paddock enclosed; several of 
these were probably smallholdings,     
although none are worked as such now.  
Some of the occupants now keep a pony, 
donkey, a few sheep, or goats on these 
meadows, and many people keep a few    
chickens in the backyard. The area is  
designated as a non-development area,  
with any housing development restricted
to infilling and none outside the      
present area designated as residential.
