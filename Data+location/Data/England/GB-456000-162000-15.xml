		<title>15SHOPPING IN TADLEY</title>
		<content> One of the commonest complaints about 
 Tadley is its paucity of shopping     
 facilities. There is a garden centre, 
 a DIY shop and two small supermarkets.
 Specialist shops include: chemist,    
 woolshop, florist, small electrical   
 shops, butcher, baker and video       
 centre. Most people questioned said   
 that they usually shop in Basingstoke,
 Newbury or at the Hypermarket at      
 Theale. They felt that a defined      
 shopping precinct with a good range of
 shops was an urgently needed improve- 
 ment. There are also a limited range  
 of services such as banks, estate     
 agents, hair dressers, builders and   
 decorators etc, plus some makers of   
 electronic equipment, and there are   
 demands for more choice as well as a  
 bigger range of shops. A new shopping 
 area is planned, but whether it will  
 satisfy demand remains to be seen.    </content>
