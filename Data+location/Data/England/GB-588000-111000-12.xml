		<title>12OCCUPANCY  PETT LEVEL</title>
		<content> Many of the houses and bungalows in   
 the S.E. corner of Fairlight and in   
 Pett Level and the Pett area of the   
 block are the result of holiday       
 building between the wars.The area is 
 within easy access of London, car     
 manufacture was increasing, workers   
 were beginning to be allowed holidays 
 with pay.Plots of land were bought    
 cheaply from local farmers.People set 
 up other types of{holiday             
{accommodation.}Still to be seen at    
 Pett Level are a former horsedrawn    
 bus, horsedrawn van and a gasholder   
 with doors and windows built in.All   
 date from the 1920's. With the        
 disappearance of farm labourers their 
 cottages were bought and refurbished  
 by{'incomers'.                        
 Many people who spent holidays here as
 children, have returned in{retirement.
