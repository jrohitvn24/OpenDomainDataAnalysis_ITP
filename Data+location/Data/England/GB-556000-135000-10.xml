		<title>10A SEASIDE VISIT</title>
		<content> Sometimes on a Sunday our family goes 
 to the beach.First we relax on the    
 sand and maybe go in for a swim in the
 sea. At lunch we probably eat a picnic
 on the beach.The children would make  
 sandcastles with buckets and spades   
 and they might even dig a great big   
 hole and bury themselves in the hole. 
 They might make sand slides to slide  
 down. They might go on the games like 
 the bouncing castle, trampolines,     
 swingboats,a big water slide and lots 
 of other things. Then after a lovely  
 day at the beach they would go and    
 look for a Take Away and have for     
 tea. Most people in our family prefer 
 fish and chips.
