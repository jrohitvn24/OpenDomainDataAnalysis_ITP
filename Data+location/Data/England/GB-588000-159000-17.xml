		<title>17CUSTOMS BELLRINGING TUNSTALL</title>
		<content>Tunstall originally had five bells,    
cast between 1573 and 1702. These were 
recast into six by London bellfounder  
Thomas Mears in 1843.They were made up 
to eight in 1923 and restored in 1975. 
This cost 6,500pounds raised by local  
ringers and grants from the Kent County
Assoc. of Change-Ringers.The bells were
removed from the tower by local ringers
and taken to Whitechapel Bellfoundry,  
London.The bells are now much easier to
ring but owing to the poor quality of  
the original castings,the tune         
and tone of the bells could not be     
improved.The heaviest bell weighs only 
7.5cwt.An enthusiastic local band      
practices every Friday for Sunday      
Service ringing and for weddings and   
special occasions.They also ring at    
Rodmersham and Bredgar,where there are 
no local bands.There have been three   
hour peals on the bells,first in 1900. </content>
