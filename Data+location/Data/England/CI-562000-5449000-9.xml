		<content>{The Sewage Plant}was built in         
 1959. Today it treats on average 5    
 million gallons of sewage per day. It 
 employs 10 people- 2 managers and 8   
 manual workers. The sewage is passed  
 through a series of 3 open and 4      
 closed tanks then the clean water is  
 returned to the sea. The solid waste  
 is used as fertiliser and the gases   
 produce electricity. The smell is a   
 problem in the new housing estate next
 door. 12 tankers are used to empty the
 septic tanks of houses not on the     
 mains drains network.{The Incinerator 
 was completed in 1979 to burn the     
 island's solid rubbish. There is not  
 enough space in the island to bury it.
 It burns a 1000 tonnes a week and     
 employs 15 shift workers and two      
 managers. The chimney is 100 metres   
 high. The site also includes          
 workshops, labs and offices.          </content>
