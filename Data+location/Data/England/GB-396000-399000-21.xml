<title>21Huddersfield Narrow Canal</title>
<content>

There have been significant changes in the view, as part of the continuing development of the Tame Valley Linear Park and the restoration of the Canal to navigation. The only features readily identifiable from the 1986 picture are the skyline profile of the remains of Staley Hall (top right), the canal wall (foreground) and the top of the keyed post (bottom right). The road crossing the canal has been raised and the canal towpath lowered as part of the construction of a new bridge to allow the passage of canal boats again.&lt;br />&lt;br />Several of the electricity distribution pylons in the earlier picture have been demolished, following the demolition of the nearby Hartshead Power Station and the remodelling of the remaining transformer and distribution substation. The two remaining pylons are obscured by trees - some planted and some naturally seeded.&lt;br />&lt;br />   &lt;br />
