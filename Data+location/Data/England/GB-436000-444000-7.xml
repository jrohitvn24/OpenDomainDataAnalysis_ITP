		<content> We found out that nearly everyone     
 these days travels by car,but some    
 people do walk.It seems to be mostly  
 old people that walk and young people 
 that use cars,also old people use     
 buses.When we looked at the A58 Leeds-
 Wetherby road to see how many vehicles
 came past we found out that 73% cars  
 13% vans, 11% lorries ,1% buses,1%    
 coaches, 1% motor bikes. We also found
 out that people do use cars quite a   
 bit.One man that we interviewed said  
 he traveled 60 miles a day in his car.
 Other people only used their cars 3-10
 miles a day.                          
 In general we found that this was a   
 small commuter village.there were few 
 local jobs and people had to travel to
 work to Leeds,Harrogate and York.
