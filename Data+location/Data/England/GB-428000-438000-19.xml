		<title>19HONDA GARAGE-STREET LANE</title>
		<content> The {cars}from the Honda garage are   
{made in Japan} and sent to England.   
 The most popular model is the 'Accord'
 because it is {cheap and reliable} and
 now people have to think about how    
 they spend their money.At the garage  
 there are 2 mechanics,1 apprentice,2  
 salesmen,1 receptionist and 1 car     
 cleaner. The cars cost between Â£4800  
 and Â£10,300.The cars are now having   
 more complicated bits on them such as 
 air conditioning,anti-locking break   
 systems and computers to govern the   
 fuel consumption.Fuel {economy}is very
 important so most models run on 2 star
 petrol,are aerodynamically better and 
 the body is lighter than those built a
 few years ago. Most customers change  
 their cars every 18 months. Men prefer
 sober colours like silver or grey     
 while ladies choose striking red or   
 white.                                </content>
