     We telephoned Eastern Counties Bus
Company and asked about local bus      
services. We learnt that six buses     
run through Stoke Ash every day of the 
week except Sunday. They link the      
village with Eye, Diss, Norwich and    
Ipswich.                               
     Simmonds are a private company.   
They run a bus through Wickham Skeith. 
This bus goes to Diss and Stowmarket.  
     You can catch a train at Diss or  
Stomarket they closed the nearest      
station which was Finningham. The      
trains go to London,  Norwich and      
Ipswich.                               
     The nearest airport is at Norwich 
which is 27 miles away.You can cath a  
plane to Scotland or Amsterdam.        
     The nearest port is Felixstowe.   
The ferries sail to Holland. You can   
take your car with you.                </content>
