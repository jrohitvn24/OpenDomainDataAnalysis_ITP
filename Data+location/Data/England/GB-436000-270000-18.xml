		<title>18Bubbenhall:The School</title>
		<content> Bubbenhall C of E Primary School was  
 built in 1864.It is a small school    
 just off the Leamington Spa to Rugby  
 road.The school holds 31 children,with
 the ages ranging from 4_8 years.There 
 are two classes in the school ,taught 
 by a teacher and the headmistress,Miss
 Baber.This small school has facilities
 for hot meals,together with toilets   
 and games equipment.The children have 
 one large playground with a climbing  
 frame.This is also where P.E.lessons  
 are held.There is not much other      
 ground available,so the children use  
 the recreation ground for games.School
 times are from 08.50 to 15.15,with a  
 morning and afternoon break as        
 well.There is a pleasant,friendly     
 atmosphere throughout the school.Due  
 to its size,curricular opportunities  
 are restricted by staff available.
