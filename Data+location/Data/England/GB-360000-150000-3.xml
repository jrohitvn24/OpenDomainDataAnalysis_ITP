		<title>03Crock's Bottom, Emborough</title>
		<content> Crock's Bottom is a wooded valley wich
 borders on Emborough and Gurney slade.
 It is a stretch of countryside where  
 now only cattle nd wildlife roam but  
 where once a thriving community lived,
 evidence of this is all around.  Stone
 cottages are seen as ruins under the  
 northern slope of the hill uninhabitd 
 since the turn of the century.  Ruined
 watercress beds are seen studded with 
 white str like lowers of Water Fennel.
 The local church going inhabitants of 
 Binegar and Gurey Slade enjoy an      
 annual Rogation sunday athrough this  
 lovely valley when the Parish         
 Boundaries are walked, tramping the   
 same tracks that once served that lost
 community of Crock's Bottom.
