		<title>07Junior to Secondary School</title>
		<content>  In September nine of our class will  
 be leaving our junior school,         
 Corvedale C.E,to go to Secondary      
 school at Ludlow.I am looking forward 
 to it because it is a much bigger     
 school and there is a canteen where   
 you can choose your dinner.           
  On June 18th 1985 all of us fourth   
 years went for a day to Ludlow        
 school.It was different to our school 
 because the children all wore blue and
 black uniforms and had different      
 teachers for each subject instead of  
 having the same teacher to teach you  
 all day.                              
  I thought it was a good school and   
 the teachers were very strict.I am    
 looking forward to going but I will   
 miss my old friends.
