<title>26The Castle Grounds</title>
<content>

The Castle Grounds continues to lie between the picturesque rivers Anker and Tame but has been massively reduced in size over the past years to make way for the Riverdrive fly over. The old baths have given way to recreation space and changing facilities for the surrounding sports such as bowls and tennis. The SnowDome now provides a huge variety of winter sports along with swimming and fitness facilities. A skate park is situated on the grounds along with an outside, free use gym and scaled down planet walk. The large grassed area has just held the 3rd midlands music festival - attracting big names from the music industry. The Castle has just played host for the Staffordshire Hoard, the largest saxon hoard found to date.   &lt;br />
