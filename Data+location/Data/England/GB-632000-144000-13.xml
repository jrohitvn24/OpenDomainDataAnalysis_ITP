		<title>13ST MARGARET'S POPULATION</title>
		<content> A population survey of the upper      
 village showed that as much as a third
 of the population might be retired.   
 This is more than twice the proportion
 in the other villages surveyed. The   
 village provides employment in tourism
 and service industries but most of the
 workers travel elsewhere. Almost 60%  
 of the total workforce is employed in 
 Dover. Most of the junior children are
 at the village school but those over  
 11 have to go elsewhere. The grammar  
 school children go mainly to Dover,   
 some girls travel to Folkestone. Other
 secondary pupils go to Dover,Whitfield
 and Walmer. The residents like their  
 village,many would leave it unchanged.
 Some want improved lighting,others    
 further traffic restrictions. A major 
 concern among old people is vandalism 
 and hooliganism. They would like to   
 see more policemen in the village.    </content>
