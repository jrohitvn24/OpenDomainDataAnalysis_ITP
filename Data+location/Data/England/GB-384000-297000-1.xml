		<title>01THE PERTON AREA</title>
		<content>                                       
In and around Perton the land is mostly
farmland. There is nothing of major or 
national interest in this area.        
  A large part of the area is taken up 
by the Village of Perton. This is a new
urban development centered on a        
man-made lake. This areas area used to 
be a Second Wolrd War Airfield and     
after the war it was used as a         
Racetrack.                             
  Away from Perton Village there is the
town of Wolverhampton, part of which is
in the survey area-Wightwick and       
Tettenhall. Wightwick is a residential 
area situated on the edge of the       
countryside. In Wightwick is Wightwick 
Manor, a 19th century house now owned  
by the National Trust.
