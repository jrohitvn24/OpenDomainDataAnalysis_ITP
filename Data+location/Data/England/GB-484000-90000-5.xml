		<title>05FISHING OFF SOUTH SELSEY</title>
		<content>    A very old fisherman told us about 
 his life.He began fishing when he was 
 17 and finished when he was 70.He was 
 Coxswain of the Lifeboat exactly 100  
 years after his grandfather was       
 Coxswain.Many of today's fishermen are
 from families who have fished here for
 generations.                          
   Lots of pots are put down for{crabs 
 and{lobsters}near rocks eight miles   
 out and then they are winched in and  
 stacked by a second "hand".The first  
 "hand" holds the tiller and the third 
 "hand" can be an apprentice.There are 
 still vacancies for third "hands".    
{Cockles,whelks}and{prawns}are caught. 
 The best time for prawns is at low    
 tide and a full moon.This may mean    
 getting up at 2 or 3 o'clock in the   
 morning.The best time for{mackerel}is 
 May but there are not so many as there
 used to be because of the groynes.    </content>
