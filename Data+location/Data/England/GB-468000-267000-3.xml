 LEVELS OF SCHOOLING THE NUMBERS OF    
 SCHOOL-AGE CHILDREN AT THE PRIMARY    
 LEVEL HAS DECLINED THEREBY CAUSING    
 ADMINISTRATIVE PROBLEMS FOR VILLAGE   
 SCHOOLS. INDEED MANY ARE CURRENTLY    
 UNDER THREAT OF CLOSURE BECAUSE OF    
 FALLING ROLLS. HOLDENBY VILLAGE SCHOOL
 HAS BEEN CLOSED MANY YEARS AND LOCAL  
 CHILDREN HAVE TO TRAVEL TO NEARBY     
 VILLAGES WHILST OLDER ONES TRAVEL TO A
 SECONDARY SCHOOL AT GUILSBOROUGH. THE 
 PEOPLE OF SPRATTON HAVE BOTH A PRIMARY
 SCHOOL AND A PRIVATE (FEE-PAYING) ONE.
 CLIENTS OF THE LATTER COME FROM A     
 FAIRLY WIDE AREA TO BE PREPARED FOR   
 THE LOCAL PUBLIC (FEE-PAYING) SCHOOLS.

 FAIRLY SIMILAR CURRICULUM BUT WITH    
 DIFFERING EMPHASIS ON THE COMPONENT   
 PARTS.PRIVATE SCHOOLS TEND TO PUT MORE
