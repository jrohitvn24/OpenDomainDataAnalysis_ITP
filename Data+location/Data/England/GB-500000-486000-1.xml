		<content> Our area of Scarborough is based on   
 the original village of Falsgrave     
 (mentioned in the Domesday Book)      
 extending westward into a rural area  
 which borders on the North Yorks Moors
 National Park. Today,Falsgrave is an  
 area of mixed housing but mainly made 
 up of terraced properties. Whilst many
 of the larger houses are now blocks of
 flats and guest houses the small      
 properties are owner occupied or      
 rented family homes.Leaving Falsgrave 
 and entering what are today suburbs of
 Scarborough the Victorian character   
 changes to housing developments of the
 last five decades. On the fringe of   
 the town recently built estates are   
 developing - home owner detached      
 houses and bungalows. On leaving the  
 town boundary small farms,mainly sheep
 and dairy,are found mixed with        
 plantations of forestry.              </content>
