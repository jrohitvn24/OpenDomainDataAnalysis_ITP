		<content> The River is called the Gannel and    
 where it runs into the sea, across    
 Crantock beach, is called an estuary. 
 The sea floods the estuary twice a    
 day creating salty marshes known as   
 'saltings'.  The area surrounding the 
 estuary is gently rolling landscape,  
 mostly farmland or coastal heathland. 
 A stream runs into the sea at Porth   
 Joke beach and during the winter high 
 tides and winds built up a sand bar   
 which trapped the stream and created a
 lagoon.  It was fairly shallow but now
 it has been made to drain away.  The  
 four headlands have high rocky cliffs 
 (about 200 feet) which are nesting    
 sites for many sea birds.  The sea and
 wind have eroded the rocks and formed 
 fascinating shapes and intriguing     
 caves.  The beaches shelve gently and 
 have very fine grains of golden sand. 
 The sand dunes are growing and moving.</content>
