		<content>  This year teenagers are very concious
 of fashion. The girls wear coloured,  
 "crocodile clips," a type of hair     
 grip. Hair styles are dramatic in     
 colour and cut, hair is shaved short  
 above the ears with spiky or long wavy
 hair on top which is made to stick up.
  Long, dangling, novelty plastic      
 earings like baseball bats, large     
 round plates, birds and fruit are     
 popular. Punks are particularly       
 dramatic and they look almost like    
 clowns. Heavy coloured makeup is used 
 with silver lips, white faces and dark
 eye makeup. Necklaces and bangles are 
 popular.                              
  "Bat wing," sleeves are common. Boys 
 wear white and a creased effect is    
 acheived. Individuals try to create   
 their own particular way of dressing  
 which expresses the way they feel and 
 the sort of person they are.          </content>
