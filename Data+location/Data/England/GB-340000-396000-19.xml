		<title>19A Brief History of Kirkby</title>
		<content> The block is located to the north of  
 the Metropolitan Borough of Knowsley  
 embracing much of the township of     
 Kirkby. Kirkby, meaning church and    
 settlement, was a village established 
 by Vikings in 900 A.D. Entered in the 
 Domesday Book as Cherchebi, one of the
 manors held by Uctred the thegn, it   
 was mainly woodland incorporating the 
 parish of Simonswood.                 
 A notable landmark is the church of   
 St. Chad who, it is believed, visited 
 Kirkby during the latter half of the  
 7th century. The church is a          
 particularly fine example of Norman   
 architecture. On its saddleback       
 central tower is a large cross which  
 is illuminated at night and can be    
 seen for miles around.
