		<title>19Transport and traffic.</title>
		<content> It may seem strange to those people   
 who live in high population urban     
 areas, but in rural areas, such as    
 those covered by this part of the     
 survey, there is a great lack of      
 transport!                            
 The village of Eartham has a very     
 irregular bus service (two buses a    
 day) to Chichester via all the other  
 villages, although this is a year     
 round service.                        
 Villagers and farmers therefore have  
 to rely on their own transport to get 
 them into the more urbanised areas.   
 These usually consist of Land Rovers, 
 Range Rovers and saloon cars. There is
 no Community bus.                     
 The major traffic use is therefore    
 private or farm transport, although   
 Amey Roadstone collect and deliver    
 their sand and gravel along portions  
 of the roads.                         </content>
