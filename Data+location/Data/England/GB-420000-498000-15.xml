		<title>15Transport in Bromp on Swale</title>
		<content>    In our D_Block the most common     
 transport is the{car.}The people who  
 live on Gatherley road see a lot of   
 cars coming off the A.1. A boy on     
 Gatherley road counted how many cars  
 went up and down in a hour. Sixty six 
 cars went up towards the A.1 and      
 seventy eight from the A.1.So         
 altogether there were 144 cars that   
 went past.                            
    The cubs in the village also did a 
 count on how many cars went past in an
 hour the King William public house in 
 the middle of the village. They saw   
 about 69 cars.Can you tell the        
 difference in the two places?.        
    For people with out cars or for    
 school children there are about 6     
{buses}a day going through Brompton to 
 Scorton or Richmond.                  
    Some people use{bicycles}mainly to 
 go to work.                           </content>
