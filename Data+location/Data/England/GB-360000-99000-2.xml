		<title>02Valley of the Sydling Water</title>
		<content> This valley has provided home and     
 shelter for people since ancient      
 times. Long before the Romans came to 
 Dorset in 54AD there was a Celtic     
 village on our hillside. In the 2nd   
 half of the 6th century the West      
 Saxons arrived and probably lived in  
 uneasy harmony with the Romano        
 British. It was  the saxons who       
 cleared the hills of trees and in     
 order to use their heavy eight-ox     
 ploughs, made and cultivated the      
 strips or lynchets along the hillsides
 which can still be seen today.        
 There are field systems on the Crofts 
 Down, Middle Hill, &amp; between Loscombe 
 Hill &amp; Folly Hill, Tumulus on Elston  
 Hill, Cross Hill, North Field Hill,   
 Cowdown Hill,&amp; Larkham Bottom; earth  
 works on Cross Hill, at the bottom of 
 Hog Hill. Spring rises at Up Sydling &amp;
  flows right through the village.     </content>
