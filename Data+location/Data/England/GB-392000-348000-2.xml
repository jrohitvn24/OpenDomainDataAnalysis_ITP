   Throughout the area there are       
approximately sixteen farms where      
dairying is carried on.                
   Mostly all of these farms have been 
handed down from father to son over    
many years .Many of these farms have   
never been modernised and the only     
things that have been changed are the  
machines used on the farms , and the   
way that the milk is collected and     
transported.Today the milk is stored in
tanks at the farm and collected daily  
by milk tankers who take it away to be 
bottled.                               
   The tankers call twice a day and the
milk is sold to the main dairies around
the area e.g Dairy Crest and Northern  
Dairies.
