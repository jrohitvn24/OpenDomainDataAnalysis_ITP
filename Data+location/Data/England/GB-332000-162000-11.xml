		<content>     The fourth year children in our   
 school, St.Martin's, were asked to    
 fill in a questionnaire about what    
 they did in their own time.This is    
 what we found:                        
 Scouts is the most popular club for   
 the boys;guides is the most popular   
 club for the girls.The most popular   
 T.V.programme for the boys is the     
 Young Ones and the most popular for   
 girls is Dynasty.The favourite hobby  
 for the boys is football and for the  
 girls is swimming.We found that the   
 most popular indoor game for the boys 
 is playing on the computer, and this  
 is the same for the girls. Football is
 the most popular outdoor activity for 
 the boys and riding bikes is the most 
 popular outdoor activity for girls.   
 Average reading time for children is  
 36 minutes and weekday T.V.watching is
 about one hour in summer.             </content>
