		<title>08Scot's Dike Earthwork.</title>
		<content> Scot's Dike is the name given to an   
 earthwork which extends from North    
 Yorkshire and into Durham and         
 Northumberland for 70 miles.          
   It is several metres high in places 
 and was probably a boundary between   
 tribes in pre-Roman days.             
   In the Richmond town plan the       
 council have decided that housing     
 development should be controlled to   
 avoid destruction of the Dike.        
   Every 7 years the Mayor,Aldermen and
 councillors,led by the Town Crier,two 
 Sergeants-at-Mace and and the Pinder  
 or pioneer,with an axe, perambulate   
 the boundaries of the Borough,starting
 at the Green bridge.It takes all day  
 with a stop for lunch.                
   The Dike forms the eastern boundary 
 of the town.The last boundary riding  
 took place in 1983.
