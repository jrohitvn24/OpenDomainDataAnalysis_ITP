		<content>  Easby Lane runs south from the Stone 
 Bridge towards the village of Easby.  
 The houses near the bridge are the    
 oldest in the village (18th. century  
 or earlier). This is part of the      
 village's Conservation Zone, so the   
 external character and appearance is  
 being retained as the interiors are   
 being modernized with grant help. The 
 Buck Inn, opposite Low Green has      
 recently been modernized. There is a  
 Fish-and Chip Takeaway establishment  
 here as well as a garage and a craft  
 shop. An obelisk in a garden marks the
 former location of Captain James      
 Cook's cottage. Beyond comes the      
 1950s' Marwood estate built in the    
 post-war boom years and the 1970s'    
 Byemoor estate. Between the older and 
 newer housing areas is Cumbor's       
 Nurseries growing shrubs plants and   
 vegetables for sale.                  </content>
