		<title>06KNIVETON POST OFFICE</title>
		<content> Kniveton is a small village with      
 only one shop and that is the Post    
 Office.It  is situated in the lower   
 part of the village  in an old        
 detached house called the Old Hall.   
 The shop is in one of the rooms.A new 
 saftey screen and counter have just   
 been fitted in the last few weeks.    
 The main buisness is the Post Office  
 but various other things are sold such
 as food (mainly in tins and packets), 
 sweets, chocolate,cigarettes,minerals,
 and a few groceries.                  
 The shop is open from 9am until 1pm   
 and then from 4pm to 5.30pm.Half days 
 closing are on Thursday and Saturday. 
 The busiest days are Pension days.    
 Most of the customers are local       
 village people,which isn't surprising 
 because from the main road it is      
 difficult to tell that the Post Office
 is there.                             </content>
