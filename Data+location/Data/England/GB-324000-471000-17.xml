		<title>171ST URSWICK &amp; ALDINGHAM CUBS</title>
		<content> We meet at Urswick Church Hall every  
 Monday, from 6:30 to 8:00pm.There are 
 seven sixes in our pack, each six is  
 named by a different colour, I am in  
 the red six. We play games,make some  
 things out of wood and do badge work. 
 I have passed my home help, athletes, 
 campers, explorers and swimmers badges
 and my bronze arrow. I have been on 2 
 camps, Littledale near Lancaster and  
 Lords Wood in Torver. I have also     
 been on 2 day trips by train. One was 
 to London, the other one was to York. 
 We sometimes go to Scout Wood,Urswick 
 where we have barbecues. We eat hot   
 dogs in buns and play games like the  
 blind trail, tracking and the bar     
 cross. It is a mile and a half from   
 Scales where I live to Urswick, as    
 there are no buses running at that    
 time our parents take turns at tran-  
 sporting us there and back by car.    </content>
