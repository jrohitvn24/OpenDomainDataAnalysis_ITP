		<content> Groups meet in the larger village of  
 Nash, mostly in the village hall,     
 though the bell ringers of Beachampton
 practice on the 5 bells of their local
 Parish Church of St Mary's.           
 In this community small changes in the
 population can have a major affect on 
 groups and this year the Over 60's    
 Club closed.                          
 Children's clubs are popular, the     
 children coming from here and         
 surrounding villages. The Mother and  
 Toddlers re-started recently and is   
 part of the larger playgroup which    
 meets thrice weekly. The Youth club   
 has a weekly evening session and      
 recently a BMX Club was formed.       
 Nash Women's Institute, part of Swan  
 Group, meets every month.             
 In winter provision is made for riding
 for the disabled at a local stables.
