		<title>19Calne Swimming Club.</title>
		<content>   My name is Joanne Burchell.My hobby 
 is swimming.I go three times a week to
 the Alpha Four Swimming Club at Calne 
 Sports Centre.I also go there from    
 school with my class.I am practising  
 for my Merit Badge.                   
   On Sundays,I do Synchronized        
 Swimming.I am trying for a badge at   
 this sport too.You have to do a       
 somersault and come up on your front, 
 do another somersault and come up on  
 your back.                            
   You also have to do movement called 
 "Bobbing".You have to lift your arms  
 in the air and you go under water.    
 Then you bring your arms down and you 
 bob up again.You try to swim a whole  
 width under water.A"Corkscrew" is a   
 twisting action while you are lying on
 the surface of the water.
