  The area mainly consists of shops,   
 houses and ware-houses. There is one  
 main street for shopping. A lot of the
 houses are on the roads near the      
 main street. Near the main street is  
 the small Shipyard of                 
 Vosper-Thornycroft.                   
  Woolston has its own Railway station,
 it is a multiple track and many office
 workers come on the trains to work.   
  Along the river many people come to  
 do fishing during their spare time.   
  Also the people there are quiet and  
 polite to strangers.
