		<content> A small stream in a deep ditch runs   
 east-west across the north part of    
 this area.The ditch is very overgrown,
 and contains nettles, rosebay         
 willowherb,various grasses and a      
 variety of other wild plants.         
 About 30% of the area is arable       
 farmland. Some of the fields have     
 already been ploughed in preparation  
 for planting winter corn. The rest of 
 the area, about 70%, consists of      
 pasture land. Many of the fields had  
 cattle grazing in them.               
 In the south east corner of the area  
 is a small woodland area with a path  
 running through it. The woodland is   
 dominantly deciduous, with a few      
 conifers. All fields in the area are  
 bordered by well-established hedges,  
 mostly of hawthorn. The hedge showed  
 little sign of having been trimmed for
 some time.                            </content>
