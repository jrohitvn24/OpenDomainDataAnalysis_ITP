		<title>13 MY DAY - NATALIE BARRITT</title>
		<content>   For breakfast I have coffee and     
toast.After breakfast I feed the cats  
and dogs and then let them out in the  
garden.At 8.45am.I get in the car and  
our mum takes me to school.At school   
Mr.Barlow,the vicar of Ash,takes the   
assembly every Wednesday I put the     
hymns on the projector and after that  
sit and listen to Mr Barlow,then we go 
back to class. We have K.M.P.,Maths,   
English and Topic work.Then we have a  
break and I sell apples.They cost 3p   
each. After break we have some more    
lessons.At 12.00pm we line up for      
dinner. Once we have had dinner we     
play  until 1.20pm.Then we settle down 
for the afternoon lessons. We might    
have a game of rounders or draw or     
paint or sew or practice for the school
concert.At 3.30pm we go home.Sometimes 
I play at the farm,then,at 6.00 I have 
fish fingers and chips for tea.        </content>
