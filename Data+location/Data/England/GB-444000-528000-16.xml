		<content> Wild animals to be seen in the area   
 include hares, rabbits, badgers, foxes
 and deer. Hares usually spend the day 
 alone, lying in a hollow on the       
 ground. After sunset they come out to 
 feed. Rabbits spend most of the day in
 their burrows, coming out to feed in  
 the late afternoon. Badgers come out  
 in the dark. Foxes are quite          
 common in the area and they help      
 to reduce the rabbit population.Deer  
 are not usually found in the area but 
 they can be seen now and again. They  
 come out from the woods to the north  
 of Brierton.                          
 Many people go hunting. Sometimes the 
 hunting is legal but some hunters go  
 on land without permission or hunt    
 animals which are protected by law.   
 Terriers and lurcher dogs, ferrets and
 polecats are used. Equipment includes 
 nets, snares and guns.                </content>
