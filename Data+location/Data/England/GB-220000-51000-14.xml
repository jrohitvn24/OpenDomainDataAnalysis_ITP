		<title>14ECOLOGY:TYPES OF BIRDS</title>
		<content> We visited some people who were       
 interested in studying birds,and one  
 of them gave us some information which
 he has gathered this year.He is a     
 fisherman.                            
 On 12th March,he saw flocks of small  
 birds coming towards the coast.He     
 thinks they were willow-warblers.     
                                       
 On 15th April,the first swallows were 
 seen.Increasing numbers of swallows   
 were seen during the next few days.   
 On 17th April,a willow-warblers landed
 on his boat,and he saw several small  
 flocks making for the coast.During    
 1984,he noticed an increase in the    
 number of cormorants,and in the winter
 of 1984-85 there were more oyster     
 catchers feeding on the rocks at      
 Talland Bay than usual.               
 We also made this list of birds seen  
 in our area:-{(see Page 15)           </content>
