		<title>09 BIGNELL HOUSE</title>
		<content>    Bignell house was built in 1866 for
the Misses Tyrwhitt-Drake for 5,500    
pounds.It was designed by William      
Wilkinson who also designed the        
Randolph hotel(Oxford).It changed hands
in 1884 and was greatly extended.The   
farm comprised of 1,460 acres including
a stud farm.Many rare trees were       
introduced into the arboretum.         
    The house changed hands again in   
1936 .It was used during the war as a  
school and also housed sergeants and   
evacuees.The house changed hands twice 
more before present owners took over in
1979.Much of the house had been        
demolished in the 1950's.Today there   
are only 16 acres left out of the much 
larger estate.The gardens are open for 
the National Gardens scheme.           
    What remains now is only one wing  
which was added to the house by Hoare  
as a nursery wing.                     </content>
