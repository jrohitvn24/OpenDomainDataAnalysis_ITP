		<title>13A Day in the Life of Alan</title>
		<content> I am nine years old and I was born on 
 January 15 1976 in Bushey, Herts. I   
 get up at 7.30 am and get washed and  
 dressed. I usually like to wear long  
 trousers, unless it's very hot. I have
 my breakfast at 7.45am and I usually  
 have toast. Then I watch breakfast    
 television. I find the news very      
 interesting. After combing my hair I  
 put on my coat and go to school. My   
 dad takes me in his car. It is a      
 Nissan Prairie, a Japanese car and the
 rear doors are sliding ones which are 
 a bit unusual. When I get to school I 
 put my things in my place in the      
 cloakroom. I like writing my news and 
 doing maths. the best. I like doing   
 maths. because you have to use your   
 brain and find the answer in the end. 
 I also like working with the computer.
 When playtime comes I like to play    
 with my friends.                      </content>
