		<content>   This block contains half the Parish 
 of Kingsland and most of the Parish of
 Eyton.  All the block is cultivated   
 except for two small areas of common  
 land.  The majority of houses and     
 cottages are timber framed, many      
 dating from the 16th and 17th         
 centuries, some faced with stone or   
 brick in the 18th century.  There are 
 a few Georgian and Victorian houses,  
 brick built, and several private and  
 council houses built in the present   
 century, much of the development being
 since 1969.  The River Lugg flows     
 across the left of the block.  The    
 flat land of the river valley consists
 of gravel and other deposits from the 
 Ice Age and since, giving rise to a   
 grat variety of soil.  Higher land    
 near Eyton is Devonian.
