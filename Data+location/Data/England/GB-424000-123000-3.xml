		<title>03Visit to Morrisholt Farm.</title>
		<content> The farm has been going for a long    
 time - we think it may even date back 
 into the 16th.century.The farm was    
 named after the Morris family (16th.  
 Cent.landowners).The farm has{Fresian,
{Hereford,and Guernsey cows}and it     
 covers 90 acres. Forty cows are used  
 for milking. On average,cows produce  
 2.3 gallons daily. Ten heifers have   
 just had their first calves so will   
 soon be ready for milking.They feed   
 the cows on{dairynuts,carrots,        
{beetpulp and hay.}25% of the herd     
 is slaughtered annually.Only one      
 person works for Mr.Plaskett so it is 
 hard work to keep the farm in order.At
 the moment they have{eighteen piglets 
 fed on{pignuts.}Near the farm building
 there is the old{carter's cottage.}The
 chimney was used to build Whiteparish 
 bus-shelter. {Free - range hens}are   
 kept for the family's use.            </content>
