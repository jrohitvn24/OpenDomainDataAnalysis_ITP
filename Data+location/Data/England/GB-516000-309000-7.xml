		<title>07DEEPING ST.JAMES NURSERY</title>
		<content>   There are 2 nurseries in Back-lane. 
 We went to visit one of them.The man  
 who owns the nursery has one large    
 greenhouse which measures 3251.5      
 square metres.It is divided up into   
 bays.                                 
   The owner grows over 45 different   
 varieties of bedding plants such as   
 begonia,cineraria,alyssum,aster,and   
 marigolds.When he has sold most of    
 these he plants lettuce. He buys them 
 in, each little plant growing in a    
 separate block of soil.This year he is
 growing a variety called Selina which 
 is named after a television news      
 reader called Selina Scott.           
   Planting begins in February.Usually 
 the begonias come up first.After the  
 bedding plants and lettuce the next   
 crop is chrysanthemums.1985 has been  
 the worst year for a long time with   
 lots of dull weather and late frosts. </content>
