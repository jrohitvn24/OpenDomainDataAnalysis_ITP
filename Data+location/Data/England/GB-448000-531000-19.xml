		<title>19Unemployment in Hartlepool</title>
		<content>      Because of the high numbers of   
 unemployed in the town, various social
 and educational activities are        
 springing up to cater for the needs of
 these people.                         
      The largest of these endeavours  
 is the newly developed 'Peoples       
 Centre' which has been created by     
 converting the old police station.    
 This is now the main focal point for  
 all the towns activities for the      
 unemployed.  The centre, apart from   
 acting in a supportive role, also     
 provides information, recreational and
 educational courses and guidance.  It 
 is completely run by the unemployed   
 people of the town.                   
      Apart from free admission to the 
 local authority run courses in their  
 colleges etc., the unemployed can gain
 free, more and more of the towns      
 facilities.                           </content>
