		<content> Both Widmerpool and Wysall have parish
 churches, Wysall's C13 with spire, Wid
 -merpool's with C15 tower (no spire,  
 it was struck by lightning in 1836).  
 The villages share a parson with      
 nearby Willoughby; Wysall has about 70
 &amp; Widmerpool 42 on the Electoral Roll.
 Both churches have a Sunday School, a 
{Mother's Union}covers the 3 parishes, 
 so does Pathfinders (11-14 yr). Wysall
 has a wives fellowship and a group of 
 musicians, Widmerpool a choir. There  
 is a lay training group for{MU}ladies,
 and prayer groups are held in the vil-
 lages. Services are held 3 times a    
 month in Wysall, 2 or 3 times in Wid- 
 merpool; the congregations unite for  
 some special services. The Methodist  
 chapel in Wysall is well supported.   
 Relations between the denominations   
 are good - some joint coffee mornings 
 and Methodist members of{MU.}         </content>
