		<title>13MOVING INTO WINDRUSH</title>
		<content>       My name is Rebecca Louise       
 Dooley.I'm nine years old and was born
 in Wales.I have two brothers.Mum is   
 from Yorkshire and my dad comes from  
 Lancashire.Two years ago dad became   
 Editor of the Gloucestershire Echo,and
 we moved into Windrush.We have always 
 lived in the country,but never in such
 a small village as Windrush.We have to
 drive for our shopping,which is       
 tiresome and expensive.The countryside
 is pretty,but very tame after         
 Wales,and difficult to walk in as all 
 the land is farmed.One thing we all   
 dislike about our village is that it  
 is heavily populated by weekenders,   
 which means many houses are left empty
 for long periods and there is little  
 sense of community.Soon we are going  
 to move to Cheltenham,I shall miss my 
 school friends but I shall not be     
 sorry to leave Windrush.              </content>
