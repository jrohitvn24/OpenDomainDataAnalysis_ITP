		<content>{A typical Saturday}                   
  On Saturday morning I get up at 7    
 o'clock and I get ready for swimming  
 at 8 o'clock. When I come home I watch
{The Wide Awake Club}and some cartoons}
 and then I watch{73.}At 11 o'clock we 
 watch{Chips}and that's on for an hour 
 and a quarter and then we watch{World 
{of Sport.}At 2 o'clock we go to our   
 friends' house for an hour. Then we go
 home and watch the rest of{World of   
{Sport.}My hobby is doing freestyling  
 on my BMX bike. I can pull wheelies   
 that go straight up in the air. At 5  
 or 6 o'clock I go to play with Jamie  
 till 8 or 8.30. When I get back at 9  
 o'clock I watch some TV for an hour   
 and then I get ready for bed. My Mum  
 gets me my drink and it takes me      
 quarter of an hour to drink that. I go
 to bed and I read for an hour and it  
 takes me another hour to get to sleep.</content>
