		<title>07Education in Brereton.</title>
		<content> There are two main schools and a Play-
 school in the Brereton area.There is a
 private school for girls called       
{Brereton Hall}which as the name       
 suggests is housed in the old Hall.The
 Hall was built in 1586 for the        
 Brereton family.The house survived    
 many vicissitudes until 1939 when a   
 new phase in its life began.A party of
 school children were brought to stay  
 from the bombed centre of Manchester, 
 and Brereton Hall School was born.    
   {The village school}was built in    
 about 1833 for the church.There were  
 two classrooms and an adjoining house 
 for the Headteacher.Today the school  
 has been extensively extended,now     
 containing seven classrooms and a     
 large assembly hall.At one time the   
 school housed 250 pupils,it now has 90
 children on roll. The catchment area  
 stretches for a radius of about 3miles</content>
