		<content> For nearly l50 years an extensive area
 between Barrington and Bedlington     
 Station has been a local landmark and 
 an eyesore. During the past two years,
 heavy earthmoving equipment has been  
 working almost continuously in an     
 effort to remove the offending PIT    
 HEAP. Today we have a pleasant        
 landscape hill in place of the dirty  
 dusty foul smelling pit heap which    
 dominated the town &amp; we have an area  
 of beauty which will give much        
 pleasure to future generations.  This 
 is one good example of how todays     
 planners are removing some of the     
 dereliction left behind by the        
 Industrial Revolution and gradually   
 returning Bedlingtonshire to something
 of its former rural beauty. The       
 Traffic Problem on the Front St       
 continues, despite ample parking      
 facilities behind the street.         </content>
