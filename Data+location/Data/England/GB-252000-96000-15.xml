		<title>15LIFE ON A DEVON FARM 1</title>
		<content> The house is cob and stone built and  
 heated by wood burning appliances. It 
 has main electricity and water, but   
 the old hand pump is still workable   
 and the water is like crystal.        
 Employment is farming and there are   
 very poor prospects for female work,  
 needing to travel at least 4 miles for
 jobs. There are only 2 buses to       
 Okehampton a week and one each a month
 to Holsworthy and Exeter so for       
 everyday use cars are a               
 life-line. Children are transported to
 both primary and secondary school, but
 youngsters learn to drive as soon as  
 possible. The telephone is also really
 essential with children scattered for 
 work and men away on farm contracting.
 Sunday tends to be "home" day with    
 much inter-visiting of friends and    
 relations and always "plate pasty" for
 tea with trifle to follow.            </content>
