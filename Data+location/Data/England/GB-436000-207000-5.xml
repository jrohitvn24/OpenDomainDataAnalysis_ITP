		<title>05Typical Family Belongings</title>
		<content> We investigated the possessions of the
families in our area and worked out the
average ownership of different items:  
 Virtually 100% of families had a T.V. 
a vacuum cleaner, a refrigerator, and  
a washing machine. 80% had at least two
T.V.s and about 60% had video recorders
 90% had a tumble drier but only 35%   
had a dishwasher.60% had a deep freeze 
and 45% had a microwave oven as well as
an ordinary oven. About 50% had a split
level oven and 50% had a combined one. 
 More than 90% of families had an      
electric mixer, half of these had a    
food processor and half had a bowl and 
stand type mixer.                      
 50% of families had a computer 'though
more were expecting to get one in the  
near  future.45% had a fairly new      
"stacking"  hi-fi system. N.B. We only 
investigated the  families of children 
at our school, not the elderly etc.    </content>
