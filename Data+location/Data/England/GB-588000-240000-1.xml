agricultural region specialising in    
cereal growing with pastoral farming   
near the watermeadows.Industry has     
been attracted and road improvements   
are being carried out.The area one of  
outstanding natural beauty is          
associated with the 2 painters         
Constable and Gainsborough with many

major activity of the region.Sudbury   
is the main shopping centre but many   
travel to Colchester,Ipswich or        
Bury St.Edmunds for major shopping.The
