		<title>19Elton Church Flower Festival</title>
		<content>  A Flower Festival and Exhibition held
 in All Saints Church in September 1984
 was the highlight of the year in      
 Elton.                                
  The theme of the Flower Festival was 
 "Country Life at Elton" with different
 parts of the Church being devoted to  
 aspects of that theme. For example the
 Altar was "Holy Matrimony" with superb
 white and yellow floral arrangements, 
 whilst one window devoted to "Farming"
 was decorated with foliage, dried     
 flowers, milk measures and a churn.The
 whole effect was very beautiful and   
 attracted many visitors.              
  At the same time, a fascinating      
 exhibition of Elton's past was in the 
 Village Hall. Old maps, documents,    
 photographs, clothing and artefacts   
 lent by villagers and societies were  
 on view. Home-made refreshments were  
 on sale throughout the weekend.       </content>
