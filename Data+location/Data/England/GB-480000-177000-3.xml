		<title>03EDUCATION. KNOWL HILL SCHOOL</title>
		<content> In{1846}the Church of England         
 authorities founded an Elementary     
 School in Knowl Hill, next to St.     
 Peter's Church.                       
 The school consisted of a Headmaster's
 house with schoolroom attached. Over  
 the years some changes were made, but 
 the major one was in{1972} when the   
 house was demolished and a large new  
 classroom block built in its place.   
                                       
 The school is now a Church of England 
 (Controlled) Primary School.          
                                       
 At the side of the new classroom,     
 which is used by the Junior pupils,   
 there is a beautiful garden with a    
 small pool, fountain and waterfall.   
 This garden is called{Puggles Puddle. 
 It was built in memory of an 11 year  
 old boy who was killed on his way home
 from school in June 1983.             </content>
