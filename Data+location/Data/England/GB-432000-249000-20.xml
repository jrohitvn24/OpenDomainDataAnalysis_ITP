		<content>   The acquisition of a cannon barrel  
 led to the building of a 12 pound     
 muzzle loading cannon, designed by    
 Peter Morton, of Oxhill, and          
 constructed by David Fisher, Gerard   
 Lewis and friends. The expertise of a 
 military munitions manufacturer and an
 ex-guards officer, an expert on the   
 Civil War, proved invaluable.         
   This group met with Brigadier Peter 
 Young at the Mitre Hotel, Oxford in   
 1969 when it was decided to recruit an
 army for Marston Moor.                
                                       
   From this group of six the{Sealed   
{Knot Society of Cavaliers}was born and
 has continued to re-enact Civil War   
 battles and skirmishes until the      
 present time. The Society now has     
 5,000 members divided into various    
 regiments of cavalry and infantry.
