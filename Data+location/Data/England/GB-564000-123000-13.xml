		<title>13BURWASH FIRE STATION</title>
		<content>    The Fire Station is down Ham Lane, 
 it has red doors, a light and a       
 telephone box. My Dad is a fireman,   
 there are seven firemen in the local  
 brigade. They attend lots of fires at 
 Mayfield, Heathfield, Battle and      
 Burwash. There is a tower to hang the 
 hoses from so that they can dry out   
 thoroughly.                           
    The fire-engine is a Dennis, it was
 made at the Hester Dennis Works in    
 Guildford. The engine is red all over 
 but the siren light glows blue and it 
 flashes a warning to people to get out
 of the way. The fire-engine doesn't   
 have very much trouble getting out of 
 Burwash. The other day there was a    
 really huge barn fire and my dad went 
 out again just after he had got in. He
 didn't return until seven o'clock the 
 next morning. All the firemen cover   
 for each other if they want to go out.</content>
