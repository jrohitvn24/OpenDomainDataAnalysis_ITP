		<title>13OUR HOBBIES-5</title>
		<content> My hobby is horse riding.I like       
 tacking horses up. That means putting 
 the bridlle on and putting the sadlle 
 on and grooming them. I hate getting  
 on.Some times the stirrups are too    
 long or too small or the sadlle is    
 on wrong. Sometimes it is hard to put 
 on the bridlle.You can not ride       
 Raindrop because she is having a baby.
 You can ride Shannon but she is a bit 
 frisky.   SARAH RICHARDS.             
  My hobby is also horse riding.I go   
 nearly every night when I get home    
 from school.I have my own horse.It is 
 called Charline. She is black and has 
 blue eyes. I go in the field and I    
 jump,walk,trot,and gallop. Sometimes I
 go up the road. I take her for a walk.
 I feed her on hay and corn in the     
 winter.I in the summer I put her out  
 to the field. Then she eats the grass.
 She is 13.2. hands high.BRIDGET DOIDGE</content>
