		<title>07BOMBS ON THE RASKELF ROAD</title>
		<content>{ Mr and Mrs Peacock live in a house   
{called 'The Birches' that is          
{bomb-proof.The house is bomb-proof    
{because their land was used as a bomb 
{dump in the Second World War.         
{  The house is forty-six years old.   
{The Peacocks have their own water     
{supply,a facility necessary because of
{the importance of their property to   
{the war effort.                       
{  They have six acres of land upon    
{which they grow their own vegetables. 
{Some of this land is rented from the  
{Church Commissioners who are important
{landlords in this Domesday block.As   
{with Mr Clark's land (see page two)   
{the ground is extremely fertile.      
{  Mrs Peacock uses the village Chapel 
{and says,"Aye,it's a pity it will     
{close down soon."
