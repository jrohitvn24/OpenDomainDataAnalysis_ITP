 The original{Oast Houses}were square, 
 Brick-built Kilns used for drying Hops
 These were superseeded in the 19th    
 Century, by the more familiar round   
 shape,with conical roof and a distinc-
 tive White wooden cowl, which is so   
 much part of the Kentish scene.  The  
 Hop fields have given way to other    
 Agricultural uses, but the Oasts have 
 taken on a new lease of life.It is not
 a new idea for Oasts to be used as    
 living quarters,but in recent years a 
 great number have been considerably   
 renovated into valuable property. Now 
 fitted with windows,modern plumbing   
 and electricity,many humble Oasthouses
 are the latest "Desirable Residences" 
 in Kent. Planning permission is       
 allowed so long as the exterior shape 
 remains in the original style.
