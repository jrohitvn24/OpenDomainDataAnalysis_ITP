		<title>11A week day morning</title>
		<content>I wake up at about 7 a.m. and turn on  
my radio to listen to Radio 1. My      
favourite group is called Wham. My Mum 
calls me and I can hear my dad         
listening to the Today Programme on    
Radio 4. My little sister has gone     
downstairs to see if Roland Rat is on  
breakfast television. I dress myself in
my school uniform (I hate it!) and put 
on my pixie boots in the vain hope that
mum will let me wear them to school. I 
eat my breakfast which consists of     
Weetabix (a wheat-based biscuit in a   
rectangular shape) drenched with low-  
fat milk - somebody's just written     
another boring report about food that  
isn't good for me soon I won't be able 
to eat anything - and frugally         
splattered with sugar (that's bad for  
me too!). I leave to walk to school    
which starts at 9. a.m.                
                                       </content>
