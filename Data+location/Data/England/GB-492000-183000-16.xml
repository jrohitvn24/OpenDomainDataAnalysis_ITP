		<content>1.Memories of Dair House School-It had 
3 forms and 18 rooms.1st years had     
hot milk and biscuits on cold days.I   
entered the 1st form at 5 years missing
the Transition class.At the back of the
school was a redwood tree,there we     
played toy cars.There were 2 climbing  
frames,and a football field which was  
fringed with woods on 2 sides.Since I  
left a new Assembly hall has been made.
2.Memories of Dropmore School-There    
  were 3 classes.We played in the sand 
pit,the trees and large blue barrels.We
went on nature walks in the Beeches,had
a school choir,recorder lessons and for
craft we chose from Scottish dancing,  
pottery and basket making.Lunch was    
a set meal.There were 75 children in   
1978,64 in 1981 and there are only 2   
classes.(N.B School is outside the     
block.)
