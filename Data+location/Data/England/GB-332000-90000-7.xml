		<title>07TOURISM IN LYME REGIS</title>
		<content> In Lyme Regis (known as the "Pearl of 
 Dorset") tourism is the main source of
 revenue and jobs, chiefly in the      
 summer season.  Lyme contains twelve  
 licensed hotels (three three-star),   
 thirteen guest houses, much           
 self-catering accommodation and       
 numerous cafes and restaurants to     
 cater for the mainly English, Dutch,  
 German and American tourists.  They   
 came to see the stone breakwater, the 
 Cobb; the four beaches, local fossils,
 the World Champion Town Crier, the    
 annual summer Regatta and Carnival and
 Lifeboat Week and the location used in
 the internationally - shown film "The 
 French Lieutenant's Woman." Lyme's    
 3,000+ winter population more than    
 doubles in the summer, helped by very 
 good and consistent media coverage of 
 the 'town'.                           
                                       </content>
