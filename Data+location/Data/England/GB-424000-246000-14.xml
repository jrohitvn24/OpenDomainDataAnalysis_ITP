		<title>14OUR HOLIDAYS</title>
		<content> I like to be near the sea or to go on 
 an adventure holiday.I enjoy lazing   
 about on a sandy beach when it is     
 quiet and getting a sun tan or going  
 into the sea.                         
 Last year we went to Wales  along the 
 peninsula near Nevin where the sea is 
 nice and warm.We were always on the   
 beach.My gran came and she loved every
 minute of it too.This year we are     
 going to the Norfolk Broads.          
 If we had no holidays we would be a   
 very long time in school.
