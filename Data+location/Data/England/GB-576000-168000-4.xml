		<content> Mecca is a city in Saudi Arabia.      
 Saudi Arabia is very hot and much of  
 it is desert.  Bedouins are people    
 who move around with their animals    
 grazing.  Mohammeds father died before
 he was born and his mother died when  
 he was six.  Abdul Tahib was his      
 guardian.  Mohammed became the agent  
 of Khadijah and then later married    
 her.                                  
 At this time Mohammed was 25 and      
 Khadijah was 40.  Mohammed came into  
 contact with many religions and he was
 interested in them all (Jews,         
 Christians, Zoroastrains etc.)  He was
 40 when he had a vision of the Angel  
 Gabriel.  Many people resisted the new
 religion but by A.D. 630 it was the   
 Dominant religion.  He died in 632.
