		<content>{(Cont. from Page 7)}                  
    As noted on Page 7{Robert}is the   
 manager of the Fair. Twin brother{John
 is responsible for all the painting of
 the lorries and rides.{Ted}and{Douglas
 do the driving and{Fred}does the      
 welding and engineering. To supplement
 the summer earnings from the Fair the 
 brothers work as tree fellers in the  
 winter months while the equipment is  
 either stored or repaired.            
    It takes a whole day to get the    
 Fair 'on the road', which is every    
 weekend from May to September. They   
 have a set pattern of visits, being   
 booked a year in advance; advertising 
 is therefore unnecssary. The furthest 
 towns they visit are Sellinge, Kent in
 the east and Southampton to the west. 
    With three sons{Lee, Tim}and{Dan}it
 is{Robert's}hope that the Fair will   
 continue for many years to come. {    </content>
