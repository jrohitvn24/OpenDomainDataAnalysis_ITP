		<title>12THE CHURCH IN NEWTON.</title>
		<content> Nominally most people belong to the   
 Anglican Church and at Christmas and  
 Harvest most attend church..The 5     
 churches in the block belong to a     
 group parish of 12 churches cared for 
 by 1 priest and 1 lay-reader.Within   
 the group there are normally several  
 services each Sunday and occasionally 
 a single group service after which    
 coffee is served and there is the     
 opportunity to socialise.It is hoped  
 that this will make people happier to 
 attend services in other churches when
 there is none in their own.The 24     
 churchwardens,the lay-reader and the  
 Rector as chairman form a group       
 council through which parish          
 administration is dealt with and      
 church problems considered.
