		<title>13THE LITTLE CROFT NURSERY</title>
		<content>    The Little Croft is a nursery. It  
 is in Lower Thurvaston near Longford. 
 There is another nursery at Longford  
 Hall.                                 
    The Little Croft is owned by a     
 man and his wife. They do most of the 
 work by themselves. They have been    
 working at the nursery for more than  
 three years. Sometimes two boys from  
 across the road help them. The boys   
 help them to plant the seedlings in   
 the spring.                           
    The Little Croft sells lots of     
 plants. They also sell jam.           
    They have a paddock across the road
 where they grow beans and leeks.      
    People call at weekends and in the 
 afternoon to buy plants and jam.      
    It is a very small nursery. There  
 is a very big greenhouse and a small  
 greenhouse.
