		<title>19Trade and Shops</title>
		<content> It is an interesting trend of the mid 
 1980's that the village shop and post 
 office at Iwade, the post office and  
 newsagents at Grovehurst, the village 
 store at Quinton and the general store
 at Kemsley are all owned by a person  
 named PATEL. These shops are often    
 open all hours and provide a valuable 
 service to the communities they serve.
 Depite this it is thought that the    
 prices charged by these shops are     
 expensive because they have no        
 competition. In Iwade tucked away in  
 numerous little sheds are car repair  
 units which are always very busy. A   
 very popular fruit, produce and garden
 centre dominates the centre of Iwade  
 and next to this is a cafe and fish   
 bar owned by the same person. Bobbing 
 has no shops but a small workshop     
 manufactures garden sheds in a farm   
 building                              </content>
