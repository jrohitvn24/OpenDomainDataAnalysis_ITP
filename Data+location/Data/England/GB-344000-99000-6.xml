		<title>06TRANSPORT IN NETHERBURY</title>
		<content> Public transport is almost            
 non-existent.  A single-decker bus    
 plies 5 times most days through       
 Netherbury between Bridport and       
 Beaminster, but not Sundays! Stoke    
 Abbott has a bus to Bridport and back 
 on market days - Wednesdays and       
 Saturdays.  Of necessity almost       
 everyone has a car, many families     
 having one each.  As soon as they are 
 old enough the boys are on noisy      
 motor-bikes and a few people venture  
 out on push bikes but, as the area is 
 very hilly and the lanes narrow, this 
 can be quite adventurous, if not      
 positively dangerous.  Also, the      
 Churches have a "Pastoral Care" group 
 with volunteer drivers who are willing
 to transport people for hospital      
 visiting.
