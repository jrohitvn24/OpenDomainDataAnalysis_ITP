		<title>18WORSBROUGH HALL</title>
		<content>{Worsbrough Hall}is just outside the   
 main part of Worsbrough Village in    
 Worsbrough Park.It is separated from  
 it by two post at the side of the road
 which were the park gates.The old     
 Barnsley to Sheffield road used to    
 pass the Hall but the owner at the    
 time{W.B.Martin Esq}had an Act of     
 Parliament passed to re route the road
 so that it did not pass his home.The  
 Hall is of{Elizabethan style}with a   
 centre and two wings.It used to have  
 beautifully laid out gardens,housed a 
 collection of rare paintings and some 
 of the best tapestries in England.More
 recently it was let to a local        
 colliery owner then bought by the     
 National Coal board and used as       
 offices.When they moved out in the    
 early 1960's it was left empty and    
 decaying.It is now being converted    
 modern{luxury apartments}.            </content>
