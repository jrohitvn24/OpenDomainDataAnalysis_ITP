		<content> In this area,farm work has been the   
 main occupation.With modern           
 agricultural practices,many jobs have 
 been lost and opportunities           
 reduced.The sale of Duchy properties, 
 and the vogue for converting barns    
 into h0uses,however, has led to an    
 increase in building trades which has 
 absorbed some school leavers and      
 offered skilled older men wih crafts  
 in stone building and slating both    
 employment and the chance to become   
 self-employed.Newcomers buying        
 property are.in some cases,creating   
 workshops in furniture making,metal   
 and leather working.                  
 R.DINGLE &amp; SONS Contractors,employ 25
