		<title>13FARMING AROUND KEELBY</title>
		<content> The area around Keelby is very fertile
 farmland. This means that the area is 
 nearly covered entirely by fields.    
 There are many different crops.In     
 this area the main crop is winter     
 wheat or rape.Other crops you will see
 are sugarbeet,potatoes,barley and     
 peas. A farmers year with corn has    
 many careful stages from grains of    
 corn to a field of swaying straw.First
 you plough a certain field.It is      
 better to plant a crop in a field     
 which had a different crop in it from 
 last year.Then you harrow the field.  
 Harrowing is the same as ploughing but
 finer.After the harrowing comes       
 drilling.This is  when the farmer     
 plants or sows the seeds.Then when the
 shoots half the size of the finished  
 product the farmer sprays the         
 shoots.the farmer sprays the shoots   
 with pesticides and herbicides.       </content>
