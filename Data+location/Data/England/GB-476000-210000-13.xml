Aston Clinton Haulage is the name of   
the biggest company in Stone. Aston    
Clinton is a village some 10 miles     
away.The company bought a large piece  
of land in the middle of Stone about 10
years ago and built their yard and     
offices.                               
 The firm has over twenty articulated  
lorries which are in constant use .    
 The lorries travel all over Britain   
and throughout Europe.                 
 Local people are not always very      
pleased about having juggernauts based 
in the village as they do tend to shake
the buildings when they go by.
