		<title>06 THE FUTURE.</title>
		<content> A 13 year old believes that in the    
future we will be transported  around  
on hovering buggies travelling at      
800mph.Houses will be powered by solar 
energy.People will wear leotards,green 
coloured trousers and jumpers with some
symbol on to show where you come from. 
 A 15 year old believes that in the    
future advanced technology will have   
taken over many of the menial jobs that
humans still do today.                 
 Many of the 13 Year olds believed that
buildings would be placed underground  
as precaution against the nuclear bomb.
 Each building would be equiped with a 
computer terminal which would enable   
the  householder to purchase goods from
home.People would live longer because  
of transplants.Many felt that living on
other planets would have happened.
