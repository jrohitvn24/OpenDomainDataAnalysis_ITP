		<title>04SEDBERGH SCHOOL</title>
		<content>      Sedbergh School was founded by   
 Roger Lupton in the reign of Henry    
 VII.  Much of Sedbergh is owned by the
 School and the playing fields are     
 extensive.  Sedbergh owes much of its 
 growth to the School and it is a major
 employer in the town.  Many of the    
 sports facilities are available to the
 townspeople e.g. swimming pool and    
 squash courts, and their many musical 
 and theatrical events are often open  
 to the public.
