		<title>15The Feast &amp; Fayre-Horndon</title>
		<content> The Feast and Fayre started in        
 Horndon-on-the-Hill when Edward I     
 granted a Royal Charter to Robert     
 Gifford and his heirs.  It was stated 
 that it should be connected with the  
 feast of the patron saints of the     
 Church, the Apostles Peter and Paul.  
 The festivities were revived by the   
 Horndon Society in 1974, having lapsed
 in the early years of the century.    
 Each year, in June, a different       
 historical period is taken as a theme.
  The theme this year is the late 12th 
 century when King Richard I was King  
 of England.  Many people who attend   
 dress up in costumes of the period.   
 Many activities take place over the   
 weekend including displays of drama by
 Palmers Sixth Form College, Morris    
 dancing, Maypole and country dancing  
 or drama from the school.
