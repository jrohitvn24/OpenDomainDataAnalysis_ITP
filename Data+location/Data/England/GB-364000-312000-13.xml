		<title>13Eyton Church</title>
		<content> The{church}is named after St.         
 Katherine.Which was built in Eyton in 
 1743.The large stained glass window   
 had a Latin date on it.MDCCCLV-1855.  
 There is a balcony overlooking all the
 seats and the whole church.Robert     
 Eyton has been said to have           
 accompanied Richard the 1st in a      
 crusade to Palestine.The story said   
 that Robert's wife promised to build a
 church if Robert returned safely.He   
 did come back,and a church was built, 
 but it isn't known whether this is    
 true,although there was a church      
 standing at that time.The tower is    
 very old now and the floors are not   
 safe in places.The bells were hung in 
 1753.There are 3 bells but one of the 
 has cracked.The church does not have  
 its own vicar.Services are taken by   
 the vicar of Wellington parish church.
