		<title>05PUB GAMES IN PONTESBURY</title>
		<content> The Red Lion public house in          
 Pontesbury has many entertainments,   
 including fruit machines, pool tables,
 dominoes, darts and juke boxes.  They 
 have competitions for pool, dominoes  
 and darts which are played on a league
 basis at home and away.  There are    
 both ladies' and mens' teams which    
 play against other pubs in the area.  
                                       
 There is a television behind the bar  
 and a jukebox in the bar which are    
 both very popular, but they do not    
 have any live entertainment in the    
 pub.  The Landlord thinks that        
 entertainment and games are an        
 important part of the pub scene and   
 attract people to his pub.  His       
 patrons prefer competitive games like 
 pool, darts and dominoes rather than  
 arcade games where they play by       
 themselves against a machine.         </content>
