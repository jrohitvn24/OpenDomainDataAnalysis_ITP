		<content> Most families prefer plain English    
 food, some eat foreign foods occasion-
 ally. All have gardens and most grow  
 some vegetables and fruit and freeze  
 any surplus. Some convenience food is 
 used. Bread and milk are delivered    
 everywhere. Each home has a television
 refrigerator and washing machine. Most
 families keep pets, dogs, cats, and   
 some rabbits.                         
 On special occasions people go out for
 a meal or entertain at home. Holidays 
 are usually taken in this country. A  
 few travel abroad and Day Trips to    
 France are popular.                   
 Two Public Houses, The Blazing Donkey 
 at Ham and The Coach and Horses at    
 Burgess Green serve bar snacks and    
 evening meals.                        
 The licensing authority is at Dover.
