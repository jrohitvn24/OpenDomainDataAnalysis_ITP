		<content> In an interview with Gillian Farrer  }
 (11) Mrs. Whylie of "The Elms"(ref.pg.
 18) recalls the following changes:    
{"Very many changes,yes,very many,very 
{built up and to my way of thinking not
{as nice.There have been several things
{like farms demolished for the building
{plots, little cottages and fishermen's
{cottages in the sand hills and they   
{were very picturesque"                
 In reply to questions on schooldays:- 
{"....and she was a Headmistress called
{Mrs.--- a fabulous teacher,and woe    
{betide you if you didn't know what she
{told you.She used to cane people and  
{you had to remember all she said and  
{recite all sorts of things.....and she
{knitted all types of things,I think   
{she was the fastest you ever saw .It  
{was the time of The Great War, she was
{always knitting balaclavas and socks  
{for the soldiers in the trenches."    </content>
