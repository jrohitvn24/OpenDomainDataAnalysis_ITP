		<title>06Inside the New School</title>
		<content> The New School opened in November     
 1984.We have got three computers, also
 a television.In the New School there  
 are curtains at the windows,and a     
 carpet that covers nearly the whole   
 school.There are new books around the 
 school,some of the books are what we  
 had at the old school.In the          
 classrooms it is warm because we have 
 got tall heaters which are attached to
 the wall.If people are in one of the  
 classrooms the heater will switch     
 itself on,if nobody is in the room it 
 will switch itself off.At this school 
 we have got more P.E.Equipment than we
 did at the old school.In the new      
 school there are showers and foot     
 baths.In the shower area there is     
 quite alot of room.The doors are not  
 wooden doors to separate the classes  
 they are partitions.
