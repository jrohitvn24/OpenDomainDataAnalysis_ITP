		<content> Most families are similar in some     
 ways but in our area we are surveying 
 differences between 16 families.We    
 gathered most of our information from 
 the caravan park.None of the families 
 had originated from this area.They had
 all moved into the area within the    
 range of 1 to 30 years.Only one family
 went to church regurally,the rest only
 went occasionally.Neraly every family 
 uses some sort of public amenity.The  
 most popular were the bus and the     
 local pub.The highest number in one   
 family was 7,but the most popular     
 number was 4.                         
 The number of families with cars was  
 14.The number of families with        
 telephones was 14.We have come to the 
 conclusion that most people have      
 modern appliances these days.
