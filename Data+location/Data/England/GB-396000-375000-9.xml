		<content>   The smaller,but nevertheless        
 important secondary side of hill      
 farming,is the breeding and rearing of
 beef cattle.An average herd is about  
 thirty five to forty cows plus one    
 bull.Each cow will usually bear one   
 calf every year and these are born    
 from March to May.They are kept out of
 doors and suck from their mothers, as 
 well as eat grass, during the whole of
 that time.In the October,following    
 their birth,the calves,like the lambs,
 are taken to market, but,unlike the   
 lambs,they do not go immediately for  
 slaughter.Instead they are bought by  
 farmers who live on the Cheshire      
 Plain.They are then kept on the       
 lowland farms where they are fattened 
 up until they are eighteen months old,
 when once again they are returned to  
 market,this time to be bought for     
 immediate slaughter.                  </content>
