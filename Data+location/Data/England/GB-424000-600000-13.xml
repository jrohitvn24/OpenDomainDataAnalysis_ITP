		<title>13HEALTH CENTRE</title>
		<content>  The health centre at Hadston serves  
 the needs of the local community. It  
 has a play area for children, waiting 
 room and reception area, rooms for    
 storing records of patients,          
 especially those of local             
 schoolchildren. There are many posters
 giving information and many magazines 
 to help pass the time for those       
 waiting for attention.                
   During a week there are many        
 different activities in the health    
 centre. Here are some of the sessions 
 and classes: physiotherapy, relaxation
 for mothers to be, help for obesity,  
 antenatal classes, general child      
 welfare sessions and social services. 
   In the centre are three consulting  
 rooms for doctors. The three doctors  
 are Dr. Creighton, Dr. Donald and Dr. 
 McBride. There is a separate room for 
 the dentist, Mr. Nutt.                </content>
