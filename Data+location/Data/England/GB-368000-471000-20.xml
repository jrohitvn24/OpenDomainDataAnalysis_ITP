		<title>20Gala Day in Ingleton</title>
		<content> For the adults there was a cheese and 
 wine stall, a tombola where you bought
 a ticket and if the number on the     
 ticket ended with a five or a nought  
 you won a prize. There was a stall run
 by Ingleton Pottery where you could   
 have a go at throwing your own pot    
 using grey clay on a potters wheel,   
 this cost 40p.There were ice cream    
 stalls, hot dog stalls and pop and    
 crisp stalls. There was a miniature   
 London Bus and small children could go
 for a ride round the field. Children  
 could have a horse ride on the        
 Shetland pony. There was a hoop_la    
 where for 20p you could have four     
 hoops and try to land them over jars  
 in which were prizes. The general     
 entertainment was given by the clowns,
 the Pipe Band, the sheepdog trial and 
 the main event, the crowning of the   
 Gala Queen, Jennifer Bond.            </content>
