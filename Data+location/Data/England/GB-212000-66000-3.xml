		<content> Today is not a very warm day in July I
 am wearing a blouse, a torquoise skirt
 and a burgundy batwing 'v' neck jumper
 with a pink stripe down the arms.  I  
 have ankle socks and cool, canvas     
 shoes.  I don't have to wear a{uniform
 at my school but my brother who goes  
 to{Bodmin Comprehensive School}does.  
 He has to wear a blue shirt, a school 
 tie , black trousers, grey socks,     
 black shoes, grey jumper and a blazer.
 We don't see many people with adult   
 uniforms. Most of this area consists  
 of farms so the general clothes for   
 men and women when working are        
 trousers, mainly made of denim, cotton
 shirts and T shirts.  In the winter   
 they wear{wellies. }When grownups     
 dress up they wear suits, but today a 
 lot of clothes are{unisex - suitable  
{for male and female.                  
                                       </content>
