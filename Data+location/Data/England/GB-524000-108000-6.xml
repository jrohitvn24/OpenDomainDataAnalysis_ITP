		<title>06DYKE GOLF CLUB</title>
		<content> The{Dyke Golf Club}was founded in 1910
 and now has over 750 members. They    
 have just built a new clubhouse which 
 opened on the 10th April 1985. The old
 clubhouse built in 1946 is to be      
 demolished to improve the car park.   
 The clubhouse is smart and members    
 have to be tidily dressed in the bar. 
 There are changing rooms for members  
 who wish to change from outdoor wear. 
 It costs Â£250 to join and another Â£200
 annual subscription. Most older people
 can afford to pay for a year and have 
 more time to play. Younger golfers who
 perhaps cannot afford to pay for a    
 year can pay a green fee everytime    
 they play. Many people play 3 or 4    
 times a week. The club holds social   
 events as well. They hold lots of     
 competitions on the course. It        
 normally takes about 3 hours to play a
 round of golf.                        </content>
