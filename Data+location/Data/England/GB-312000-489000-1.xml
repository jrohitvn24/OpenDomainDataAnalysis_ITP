		<content> There are 4 principal features in this
 area which has few buildings and no   
 human habitation.   There are three   
 hills Kirmount Buck Barrow, Buck      
 Barrow and Stoneside Hill and an      
 ancient road known as Colney Fell     
 Road.   The entire area is within the 
 National Park and part is owned by The
 National Trust.   The road is single  
 track with passing places and is      
 surfaced with tarmac.   The road from 
 Bootle to Corney Fell is unsurfaced.  
 Walls are neglected and broken down.  
 The road is used by walkers at        
 Windscale and is too busy for its     
 condition.   There is a public        
 bridleway from Low Kirmount to Burn   
 Moor but there is little or no visible
 signs of it.   The area is used for   
 the grazing of sheep and some cattle. 
 The only buildings are abandoned farms
 at Lambground &amp; High Kinmont.         </content>
