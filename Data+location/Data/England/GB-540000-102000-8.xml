		<content>  St.John's church stands overlooking  
the river Ouse. The church is of medium
construction and faced with flint. It  
has an unusual tower (there are only   
two other examples of round towers to  
be seen in Sussex).                    
  The round tower is topped with an    
octagonal wooden shingle steeple, which
was renewed in 1980 using Canadian     
Cedar. There is a weather vane of a    
large gilded fish (mentioned by Kipling
in one of his poems).                  
  The present building, origionally of 
the 12th century has a nave with       
rounded Norman arches, flanked on      
either side by side aisles rebuilt     
during the restoration of 1882.        
 The font and the chancel both date    
from the 13th century. The stained     
glass (with the exception in 1983 of an
example by Marguerite Douglas-Thompson)
dates from the restoration in 1882     </content>
