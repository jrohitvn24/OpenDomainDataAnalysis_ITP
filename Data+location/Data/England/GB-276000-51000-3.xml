		<title>03LIFESTYLES VILLAGE MORELEIGH</title>
		<content> The buildings in Moreleigh are of     
 mixed styles and construction - there 
 are six council houses but no listed  
 or protected buildings.  The Church is
 All Saints and is reputed to be 13th  
 Century.  Moreleigh boasts a Post     
 Office, two post boxes and a telephone
 kiosk.  The Post Office sells sweets, 
 tobacco and stationery.  Although     
 there is no public transport to or    
 from Moreleigh it is possible to use  
 the school bus service.  Harbertonford
 has a community bus scheme running    
 which it is hoped will be developed to
 include several villages, Moreleigh   
 and Halwell among them.               
 Moreleigh is visited by a local baker 
 twice a week, a baker/grocer and a    
 fishmonger once a week, a butcher who 
 will bring orders and milk and eggs   
 are delivered from Halwell.  The      
 mobile library calls every fortnight. </content>
