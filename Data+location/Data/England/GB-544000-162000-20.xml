		<content>The area of Orpington stretching to    
Green Street Green and Chelsfield is   
largely residential,although one third 
of the land is used for arable farming.
One major road,two main roads,and      
smaller tree-lined roads cross this    
area.Commuters to London have a good   
train service.                         
Most of the people live in well-built, 
brick houses put up before 1939,or     
modern homes erected in the last       
decade.                                
The area is well served by schools and 
churches.There are three local shopping
centres but most people do their main  
shopping in Orpington or Bromley.      
Orpington Hospital provides care for a 
large population.The original huts from
1915 are now used for administration.  
The second world war huts are used as  
wards.The new block,18 months old,has  
the most modern equipment and computer.</content>
