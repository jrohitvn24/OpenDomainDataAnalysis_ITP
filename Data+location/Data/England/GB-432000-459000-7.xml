 tenants on the Mountgarrett estate.   
  Farmhouses are usually stone built.

 grazing,otherwise the farming is      
 mixed, with both cattle and sheep.    
  Crops include hay, summer and winter 
 wheat,sugar beet, potatoes and        
 rapeseed.

 largely ploughed land with some       
 deciduous wooded areas.

 fruit for sale to the public,         
 sometimes on a "Pick-Your-Own" basis.
