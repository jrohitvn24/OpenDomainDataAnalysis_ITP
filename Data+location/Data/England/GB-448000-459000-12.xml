		<content> The majority of homes have the        
 telephone installed by British Telecom
 and pay a quarterly account.Two public
 telephone kiosks are sited in         
 Linton-on-Ouse,one being on the R.A.F.
 Station and one in Newton-on-Ouse.An  
 automatic telephone exchange is       
 situated between the two villages.    
   The Post Office has a branch in a   
 village shop in Linton,open four and a
 half days a week,Newton having lost   
 its Post Office several years ago.Mail
 is collected from three post-boxes in 
 Linton and one in Newton,twice a      
 day,once on Saturday and never on     
 Sunday.A delivery of mail,brought from
 York,is made once a day.              
   In Widdington there is no Post      
 Office.Mail is delivered to one farm, 
 the other two householders collecting 
 it from the village two miles away.
