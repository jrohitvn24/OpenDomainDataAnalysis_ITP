		<title>01DESCRIPTION OF THE AREA</title>
		<content>   The area lies at the northern end of
 the "island" of Lothingland and is a  
 mixture of agricultural and           
 residential land. The area contains   
 large parts of the parishes of        
 Bradwell and Burgh Castle, and small  
 parts of Belton and Gorleston-on-Sea. 
{  Bradwell}is a large village of over 
 7000 people. It has been growing since
 the war, but the major growth has been
 in the last 20 years.The majority of  
 houses are privately owned.           
{  Burgh Castle}is still a small       
 village, but it provides chalet and   
 caravan accomodation for tourists at  
 several locations; this area being    
 part of the Norfolk Broads.           
   A major development of the 1970's   
 has been the growth of an industrial  
 estate, known as{Harfrey's estate.}   
 This light industrial area is still   
 expanding.                            </content>
