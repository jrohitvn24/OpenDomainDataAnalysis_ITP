		<content> The absentee landlord of Swell Wold   
 Farm owns land in the North Cotswolds 
 which entitles him to hunt with the   
 Heythrop Hunt. The land is let, half  
 of which grows cereals, the other half
 is sub-let for sprout growing. The    
 sprouts will be used to supply        
 supermarkets and are therefore planted
 in batches so that they do not all    
 crop at the same time.                
 Eyeford Hill Farm was until 4 years   
 ago a dairy farm. It now consists of  
 165 hectares of cereals, 60 hectares  
 of permanent grass, 10 hectares of    
 woodland, mainly deciduous. 400 trees 
 were planted Spring 1985. Animals kept
 are 2 Blonde Aquitaine bulls, 14      
 Friesian cows with calves, 90         
 Freisian x Hereford cattle, 2 Jersey  
 cows. Crops are wheat and barley and  
 triticale, a new crop this year. There
 is a manager and one farm worker.     </content>
