		<title>05Housing on Hunshelf.</title>
		<content>  For a rural area,Hunshelf is fairly  
 densely settled.The settlements       
 consist of hamlets and isolated       
 buildings. Most of the houses are     
 old.They are mainly built of          
 stone;some newer ones are brick.They  
 are on the whole quite large,and are  
 nearly all detached,although          
 semi-detached and terraced houses can 
 also be found.                        
  A typical feature is the scattering  
 over the whole area of isolated       
 farmhouses and out-buildings.These are
 quite close together, reflecting the  
 small average size of the farms and   
 the productive land.                  
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
