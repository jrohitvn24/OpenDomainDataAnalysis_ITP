 Notable buildings include the mainly  
 medieval parish churches of Yalding   
 and Nettlestead, Nettlestead Place    
 with a fine 13th century vaulted      
 undercroft, West Farleigh Hall (early 
 Georgian), and Tutsham Hall, West     
 Farleigh, Buston Manor, Hunton, and in
 Yalding, Cleaves (1663), Court Lodge  
 (circa 1690), Church House and 18th   
 century Kenward House. Yalding High   
 Street has fine buildings, many being 
 timber framed. Particularly attractive
 are Randalls Cottages with white      
 weatherboarded fronts and thatched    
 roofs, the only thatch left in the    
 High Street. Several outbuildings of  
 Court Lodge Farm are now houses and   
 several oast houses in the area have  
 been converted to houses. On Yalding  
 Village Green is preserved the lock-  
 up (1786) to hold offenders overnight.</content>
