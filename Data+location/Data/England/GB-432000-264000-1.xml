		<content>   Domesday Survey 1985 approaches,    
 eagerly the youthful commissioners of 
 Cashmore Middle School and Trinity R.C
 Secondary School prepare to survey    
 their 3x4km D-Block.                  
   The area which falls to our lot     
 covers the territory to the east of   
 Leamington Spa Parade and Brunswick   
 St. The 12km sq. rectangle covers the 
 suburbs of Lillington, the modern     
 Sydenham Estate, Radford Semele and   
 Whitnash. The area spreads east across
 the popular recreational facilities of
 the Campion Hills and Newbold Comyn to
 the serenity of the ancient Bury of   
 Offchurch.                            
   Enriched by the variety of          
 architecture, beautiful parks, popular
 shopping facilities, and developing   
 light industry, the area continues to 
 attract visitors and residents from   
 near and far.                         </content>
