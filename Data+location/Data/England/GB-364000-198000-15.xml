		<title>15FISHING IN BERKELEY PILL</title>
		<content> The{Pill}is a popular place for       
{fishing}and as many as 20 people have 
 been spotted there at once. The types 
 of fish caught in the Pill include    
 eels, rainbow trout, brown trout, grey
 ling, minnow, roach, dace, chub,      
 gudgeon, stone loach and flounder.    
 Every year{elvers}make their way up   
 the River Severn to the Pill. They are
 about 3 years old when they arrive and
 stay several years until they become  
{eels,}they then return across the     
 Atlantic to breed. When the elvers    
 come, people arrive wearing waders,   
 carrying large nets and catch the     
 elvers as the tide comes in. They are 
 considered a{delicacy}when fried in   
 bacon fat or boiled.                  
 When the Pill was tidal boats used to 
 carry cloth and wines upstream to     
{Berkeley Castle;}the{dam}has ended    
 this, but it has improved the fishing.</content>
