		<title>20Cornwood's oldest inhabitant</title>
		<content>   Beatrice Haynes,91,Cornwood's oldest
 inhabitant,lives alone,a widow of 23  
 yrs.Looking back,she remembers the    
 village brass band;visitors from Ply- 
 mouth arriving at Cornwood station and
 walking to local beauty spots;her     
 father breaking stones to make roads  
 and her brother-in-law,who was the    
 village bootmaker.She says"life is    
 better today...in some ways" We have  
 carpet on the floor instead of sacks; 
 water indoors and not down a well.When
 'in service'she worked from 7am.-9pm. 
 and then ended her day huddled by the 
 fire. Now she enjoys local radio and  
 TV. and electricity has made life much
 easier.
